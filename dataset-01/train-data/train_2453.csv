2,No screws or pre drilled holes,The splash guards arrived quickly. I tried to install these on my 2012 Hyundai Sonata but they didn't fit right even though the guide said they fit. So I opted to install them on my sister's 2007 Honda Civic since she damaged her OEM splash guards earlier. They don't look or have the feel of the OEM product. These are more like thick rubber vs. the OEM hard plastic for splash guards. That may be the big difference in costs. I had to measure and drill holes in these. There were no screws or mounting equipment included. Just measure and hope for the best. They are currently on now and let's hope they stay on.
1,rear mud flaps,These were suppose to be for the rear of a 2008 Impala. These were a very poor fit. I fooled around intalling these for 30-45 minutes after I had already installed front mud flaps. They are NOT the correct design for this application. Don't purchase this model for any Impala 2006-2011!
3,Not a custom splash guard: So you have to start drilling!,"Disappointments: 1) Upon opening this item from the box, I was surprise that there were no holes on the splash guard to attach them to your car. I realized that these splash guards are made to fit many different cars, and are not specific to one vehicle. 2) The directions said that you had to use a drill to make holes for the screws (which are used to attach them to your vehicle). Not a good feature. There is a risk for errors when drilling the holes on the splash guards. 3) Screws were only provided, and there was no backing for the screws to provided an anchor for the screws as you attached them to your wheel well. I hope these screws don't come un-done.Results: Once attached they do look ""OK', but I don't think they have a real custom look. I'm not sure if I would buy them again. Yes, they were not very expensive, but I just wish I knew that I would have to do all this drilling, and guessing where to drill on the splash guards."
2,Ehh its whatever,"I bought these thinking they would line up decently on my car.. Well after receiving them and doing a test fit, they look like garbage. I won't be installing these but I'm sure they fit ok on some other cars.. Just not on my Honda CR-Z"
5,powerflow mud flaps,I purchased these for my 2006 Merc. Montego..They fit perfectly as described and encluded allmounting screws needed for instalation..They really add protection and looks to my car. They fit bothfront and rear as described....D. Strickland...North Carolina
2,Did not fit 08 Lexus GS350,"Unfortunately, the mudguards did not fit my car, so I had to return them. Amazon.com, however was great as always. Quickly refunded my money without any problems."
2,i wouldn't purchase if i knew what i was in for,when i first bought this product i thought it would just fit right on and i would be alL set. I was sadly mistaken. It was a pain to put on with my drill because of my tires getting in the way and i had to drill holes through my car witch broke some of my drill bits. I love this website just not this product.
2,not for 07 hyundai,-do not fit 07 hyundai period.-no pre-drill holes-if it can fit then it might be a ok product
1,Where are the other 18 and a half pounds?,"I wasn't really sure what was included in this ""set"", but at 19 pounds how could I go wrong, right? Wrong. The ""coconut fiber box"" tore like tissue paper, there are only two spices in tiny little tins, and there is maybe a cup and a half of rice. Can you say ""gyped""?"
3,Average,"The camera itself comes with a zip shell that has a belt loop, so the holster is only useful in situations where you are using the camera every few seconds and need both hands free inbetween. It is NOT a substitute for the zip shell: I was walking with it and clipped a doorway, unaware of the added girth from the holster, and the camera fell out of the holster onto a concrete floor! I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known in advance about the zip shell, however I'm not sorry that I have it."
3,Be Careful,Be careful that the holster does not swivel on your belt and the HD2 falls out. Luckily mine was onto a carpet!!
1,Do not buy this case!,"I purchased this case despite a few bad reviews and the fact that there are few options. The HD1000 barely fits in and once in, it swivels to the left and right, which will cause the camera to fall out as it is top heavy due to the large lens. If it didn't swivel so easily, I might be able to put up with it, but that's not the case.It is basically unusable for me, so I wasted the $20+ dollars."
2,"Good, but not quite good enough","Good quality, but seems to better suit the smaller models. Mine is a HD2, and it feels a bit too big for the holster, and I am nervous about it falling out, or damaging the camera with the cord for the lens cap. Back to the LowePro !"
4,Hope this helps me!,"""Haven't had a chance to own and use for any length of time yet, but I will update more after I have. I bought this for a specific use for acupuncture appts as I have fibro and arthritis and cant take lying on their table for my appt. I am so hoping this allows me a way to cont."""
5,Funky,"The Funky Collector is full of pearl jams, some in very rare versions. This is a must have for Funky lovers as me. A shame it is out of print. Let's pray for a re-print. God bless Funky."
3,Attachments are magnetic,"Although this is nice, the attachments are held on by a magnet so they do not ""snap"" on tightly. Not for the younger child, who may get frustrated. My 9 year old enjoys it."
5,"Wondorous, absolutely wondorous.","The cd was wonodrous, ansolutely wondorous. Go out and buy it! It's well worth your money. I bought it just today and I've been listening to it all afternoon. I only wish I would've bought it sooner. This is one of the few cd's that I can turn it on the first song and not change it the whole cd. Only with Michelle Branch, Rooney,and Shakira am I able to do so with. If you have different intrests in music and choose that you won't like this, listen to it, then make your judgments! It's an AwEsOmE, aWeSoMe,AWESOME cd! Plus the guys are way hot, adding to the greatness of it all.::Kisses to The Deuce Project::"
5,One of the best UNIX books I've seen,"This book is a wonderful resource for someone comfortable with computers but new to UNIX. It covers a lot of introductory topics with minimum wasted space. The authors don't go into any single subject too deeply, so it's not overwhelming to someone who just needs to get around on a UNIX system, but it's nonetheless very information-rich, and by the end of the book they cover some surprisingly complex topics.I highly recommend this book to anyone starting off in UNIX, be it user or sysadmin."
2,Disappointed,"The title sounds perfect for me, but I found this book very frustrating. Much of it is paraphrased man pages, and there are very few actual examples. This is frustrating when you have to really study, say, the regular expression syntax, when a simple example would do wonders instead. I do use this book occassionally for quick reference, but otherwise look elsewhere."
5,The best Unix introduction for computer-literate readers,"This is one of those rare books that does exactly what it claims. I have programmed in many languages and used many operating systems; I didn't need a book that explains what a file or a directory is. What I wanted was a book that let me map my previous knowledge of other OS's to UNIX: how do I cut out a column of info from text file? How do I use the file security methods? What can I find out about my running processes? How can I get a job to run in the background? For questions like this the book is perfect. It assumes you know about computers but don't know UNIX. This is probably the single most useful computer reference book I own. If this book doesn't meet your needs, then you're on your way to being a power user, in which case I recommend the O'Reilly ""UNIX Power Tools"" book."
4,20th CENTURY TEUTONIC MOZART!!!,"Rarely do I quibble with the with the good folks over at Classics Today. Usually I take them at their word--their reviews have the aura of words carved in granite and handed down from the mountaintop. Yet this is my second disagreement with them when it comes to a CD in the Philips 50 series (the other was the disc of piano music by Satie).Too slow? (This was also an accusation cast at the Satie)Must all Mozart be either spritely or lacerating? Furthermore, I own the Bohm recordings. This one just speaks to me more somehow.This music is noble.This music retains its charm.This is Mozart for those looking inward rather than the extroverted.I give this disc my full recommendation."
1,A great final performance ...,"It must have been final, because Krips sounds (and looks, gauging by his appearance in the liner notes) as though he were dying on stage. This is lifeless drivel by a hopelessly mediocre conductor. It certainly doesn't help that I was smacked in the face with a big ol' ball of tape hiss when I put it in either. I personally don't understand why this got five stars. If you know that there is a better performance out there, why would you even listen to an inferior one, much less ""allow it to grow on you""? I'd just like to point this out to set the record straight- if you listen to this performance more than once, you don't love yourself enough."
5,"Information with details, research and guidance",Murry's book gives so much information on the subjects of diabetes and hypoglycemia. It was also nice to see the two together since they do have a relation. His guidelines are very detailed and easy to understand. This book has helped me and has given me more of the information that I have been searching for. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,Gets the job done!,"This Heatshield Sunshade gets the job done. It fits the Acura MDX 2007 windshield perfectly and reduces temperatures dramatically on a hot day. I should have gotten one of these sooner! I should note however, this is the roll up rather than the accordion fold-up, and sometimes you may have to give it a second roll in order to get it tight enough to use the attached velcro strap. Otherwise, no complaints about the performance."
5,A remarkable product!,I have been taking care of a stray cat for a little over a year. Last November ( 2010 ) the cat was attacked by either a hawk or raccoon and its face was seriously wounded and it looked like it would lose its eye. After reading a book on herbal care I learned that Echinacea/Goldenseal work together as an antiviral/ antibacterial agent so I went on the hunt. I found this product on Amazon and ordered it right away. I added 10 drops to wet food twice a day along with 1000 mg l-lysine as per a vet's recommendation. It was a long cold winter but the cat returned twice a day for its medication. Eventually after 5 months of regular treatment the wound healed and the cat's eye cleared up. I do not know if the cat would have survived without this treatment. I recommend its use to anyone who is working with stray and feral cats that have been wounded or are ill and who do not have immediate access to veterinary care.
5,great for birding with glasses,"received these as a gift after i lost an old pair of cheapy binoculars that i used for birding. was a little wary at first since there were only 2 reviews, but i have to agree with the other reviewers that these are great for people that wear glasses. the plastic twist-up eye cups are much more sturdy and easier to use than the rubber roll-down ones i've seen on other binoculars. image is crisp and clear, even over glasses. it also seems that the price is also very reasonable, as many birding resources recommend binoculars that cost over $100, if not $300."
5,Perfect for me.,"These binoculars are exactly what I wanted in order to be able to watch the birds in my back yard and take them on trips with me. They are very comfortable, even over my eyeglasses. I rate them as excellent - and a good buy."
4,Great for the price.,For the money I paid to Amazon for a pair was a great bargain.My wife and I use them mostly for birding.They're very bright and clear.The only con is that you have to hold it away from your eyes a bit to get vision from sides equalized.
3,Mediocre low level player,I bought this player after its cousin model WAS a great player.The anti-shock is great but the sound quality is average and the only type of sound manipulation is the bass level control which -well- just controls the bass which isn't much.The player has the anti-shock but it tends to stop for no reason once in a while with discs that have no scratches.The BIGGEST problem that all the Sony models have is the headphone jack. The original discplayer I had worked great until the jack stopped working. I opened the player and couldn't find any wrong with it so I couldn't fix it.It's a real shame that the EXACT same thing happened to this player as well. I guess it's an issue with this particular line of Sony players. Perhaps since I put my player in my bag all the time that there was a lot of trauma and the jack couldn't handle it.Tis a shame indeed...
4,All in My Family,"If you have not yet been bitten by a bug called Family (the late sixties, early to mid seventies GENIUS band from the UK), catch up now by purchasing Bandstand, Fearless, and Family Entertainment. Melodic, driving, multilayered, fascinating music from a one of a kind, supremely talented wunderband. Get on board!"
2,Cannot recommend.,"Two out of five stars. This book is a bit better than the minimum one star thanks to its attention to environmental detail, but all the good and interesting stuff in this book is in the background. The protagonist is *supposed* to be a decorated veteran with experience working with different people of different positions and levels in many different settings. But the protagonist in this book functions as a tactless rookie cop bounced back and forth by events like a ball in a game of ping pong.If as much work had been put into the plot and making the principal characters' backgrounds, motivations, and actions believable, as had been put into the environmental details, this book would really have been something."
3,"Finally, Ms. Ballard can be heard!","Ms. Florence Ballard (formally of the Supremes) can finally be heard. This shelved collection of songs for her solo debut (1968)can now see the light. I was impressed with the original songs; ""Love Ain't Love"" & ""Forever Faithful"" as well as covers such as ""It's not unusual"" (Tom Jones) & ""Walk on by"" (Dionne Warwick). Unforturnately, I do believe it would not have faired well with the buying public, and if it did, it would have been only for two reasons: 1)Florence was a former Supreme, 2)She has a powerful voice. The material could have been better for such a strong vocalist.I would still recommend this CD, only if you are a supreme fan who looks beyond the stardom of Diana Ross.Buy it only for your Supreme collection!!!!!"
3,FOREVER FAITHFUL,"I love Florence Ballard - but unfortunately this LP proves that she could not have carried the Supremes to the stardom they reached - she was not as earthy as Aretha or Gladys and at best her voice was similar to Martha Reeves or the Marvelettes. This is probably because she was not supported at ABC and there is no evidence that they helped her perfect her recordings. Her true legacy will be the Supremes Songs of old as a Lead Background singer behind Miss. R. MIss R and Flo were a perfect combination - some say a Duet. The solo Flo is drowned out here by memories of what may have been and of what was - the haunting 'You're Gone but Always in My Heart' from Supremes Sing HDH is appropos a testament to Flo's vevelt voice. unfortunately when she sued the lawyers who had stolen all her money, they claimed that the ABC sessions failed because she had no talent. How sad - Remember Flo as she was in the PAst - with Diana and MARy - those were the golden years."
3,Talented singer,"After listening to this CD I have come up with two conclusions, Florence was a talented singer, but given mediocre material not suited for her voice. Her voice is very bluesy and jazzy and that is not the material she was given.You can be a great singer, but if the song is not right the whoel thing will flop and thats what happened with her. Flo's voice reminds me of the great Bille Holliday. But you would not expect Billie to be a pop singer, nor would Flo. After Holland-Dozier-Holland (spelling) stoppend writing songs for the Supremes the groups hits started getting less and less even with Diana Ross singing. I love Diana Ross, but she to had her share of commerical failure.Lets stop judging people and see them for the talent they have and Flo sure did have a lot. i have played this recording many times because her voice is great."
3,Her Voice&Feeling are there but the Material is Suspect,Florence Ballard truly had a Voice that brought Feeling&Soul.but the Material here doesn't fully capture Her Essence as a Artist fully to me.She had a Major Impact with the Surpremes more than She is given Her Due.but the Material here is the only thing Holding Her back you can Hear the Drive&Soul in Her Voice.
4,Berry's a little fat,"I'm a refugee of the 60's and I can remember the days when, riding a school bus for long hours in rural Oklahoma, you just wanted to scream ""please no more!"" when Diana Ross' screeching voice came over that tinny radio tuned to KOMA. I for one was glad when she left the Supremes. I thought they'd start making good music again - not the call me miss ross crud that they churned out after 67 and until she finally left. Berry Gordy was a fat headed little man - after all flo's story is out there now. Flo was as talented as Aretha and Patti and the ladies who didn't try to hide their soul."
5,In memory of Florence Ballard,Forever Faithful...Heavenly Allah...give back the star that was taken from her...love L
4,Gone but not forgotten Florence Ballard,"This collection of previously unheard Florence Ballard tunes is a valuable find. Diana Ross' career, of course, rose straight to the top of Motown and we can even see and hear Mary Wilson from time to time wrestling with a tune. But Florence Ballard's voice hasn't been heard by the general public for decades. As a long-time Supremes fan, I am happy to own these tunes from the ""lost Supreme."" But one thing is certain: after hearing the CD, it is clear that while Florence certainly had a strong, melodious voice, it is no mystery why Berry Gordy chose Diana Ross' voice as the one that would lead the Supreme to the top of the charts."
1,The woman behind the curtain,"For years I heard the gripes that Florence Ballard was the ""true talent"" of the Supremes with an amazing voice that could put Diana's to shame. Well, now we hear this voice in all it's glory, and all I can think is ""Huh?"" At best she was a capable singer -- there is simply nothing outstanding or distinct about her voice. Of course, now the misgruntled Diana-haters are complaining that this album isn't really the best of her material and doesn't do her justice. Give it a rest. The poor woman was in way over her head and suffered from major mental illness (depression) and substance abuse. There is no one to blame for her tragic end. End of story. Can we finally move on please?"
2,Fact Verses Myth,"Myth:Florence Ballard has gone down in mythology as beinga very talented and soulful vocalist that was totally wasted/ruined in the Supremes.Fact:Mrs. Ballard was NO Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle or even Jennifer Holliday. Anyone who saw Florence in person or has listened to her music (that is now available on CD) can tell that: Same goes for ""pity poor"" Mary. But of the two I'll take FlorenceThe Supreme you are looking for is Diana"
4,Queen of Soul,"Florence Ballard always had a great voice. Too bad we didn't get to hear much of her in The Supremes. ABC Record Label should of been able to provide her with solo success but it didn't, the only reason why because Flo wasn't allowed to use The Supremes name for publicity, all she could say was she was a member of a very popular girl group, I think if she could of used the supremes name to help her so people would know who she was and that she been around she could of been big, people thought of her as a new-comer. But hopefully this CD will open the doors for her through a new generation of young people."
2,I love Flo but these aren't very good,"When I was in law school about ten years ago - before this album was released , I hooked up with a guy who had a bootleg copy of Flo's unrealsed ABC Album and made a copy on cassette for me - I was so disappointed I taped over it (although looking back that was crazy - what if the songs had never been published!!!) - Anyway I love Flo and I think she did have an amazing voice but most of the songs on the ABC record just suck. They are bad songs and I'm not sure anyone could make them work. If she'd had more funky, hard edged songs such as ""Like You, Babe"" and My World Is Empty Without You and You Keep Me Hanging On by the Supremes I think she'd have been a knock out. Having said that, a couple of the tracks are great - Like You Babe, Ain't That Good News, Love Ain't Love are all terrific."
3,What Could Have Been...,"Florence Ballard didn't get a fair shake with this album. For years she was fighting to sing leads in the group she formed back in 1959, The Supremes. But when the group hit with ""Where Did Our Love Go"" with Diana Ross singing lead, that was all she wrote. ""Love Ain't Love"" and ""It Doesn't Matter How I Say It"" were the songs chosen for release, but you can really her Flo belt on ""Your's Until Tomorrow"" A must have for any Supreme fan."
4,"Florence was Talented, But in Wrong Genre of Music","I have always felt that Florence Ballard's voice was meant for something else besides pop music. She did not sound better or worse than Diana Ross. They both have uniquely different sounds. Diana's voice was fitting to sing as The Supreme's lead singer. The songs were written for her type of voice. Florence's voice sounds more on the style of Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Lena Horne, and some of the other singers of that genre. She could have probably even been on Broadway, if she would have had the right people supporting and backing her. Then too, the problems in her life was also probably an impediment to her accomplishing very much. It's sad that she had to die so young leaving her small children behind. Who knows what she could have accomplished had she lived longer."
4,Fantastic Flo!,I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album. It's about time we heard some music from this truly talented woman! I miss Florence tremendously and it's a real shame Motown pushed her out.There is no doubt that Flo had a much better voice than Diana! My favourite tracks are Hey Baby and Heavenly Father - these tracks have a truly amazing sound and Florences voice is beautiful and strong.I would recommend you buy this album. Florence was the founding member of the Supremes and she even named the group.God Bless you Flo. x
5,"A fascinating, unforgettable read .","Facsinating, in a word, describes Anita Lobel's book "" No Pretty Pictures"". Even though I am 33 years old I found her book to be incredibly interesting (even though it's claimed to be a ""young adult book). I have always been interested in the Holocaust survivor stories, and ""No Pretty Pictures"" takes you on a roller coaster ride of ups and downs of one survivor and her younger brother. Anita Lobel's way of describing her memories make you feel like they happened yesterday. The way she relates the story through her long ago child's eye to the teenaged, more mature eye leaves the reader in awe of her ability to tap into shelved but not forgotten memories. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Even old adults (like me), would surely find this book inspiring and unforgettable. I will never forget it, it made me appreciate everything in my life a lot more."
4,Looking at a new life,"This book is a great true story for teens to read. It helps give an easy to read explanation of the life of a child in war. As this book starts out a young girl who is Jewish lives in a small village with her family. She has to be hidden away from the Nazi soldiers or she'll have to be taken away from her loved ones. Her father has abandoned the family and left her mother, brother, nanny, and herself to find a way out. Again, I think this book was really great and any one would enjoy reading it."
4,No Pretty Pictures,Anita was a normal child but never really lived a normal child hood. She and her brother both were jewish. They were on the run and hiding with their christan nanny. The story of survival is one of the most tragic times: the holocaust. This story is sad yet will keep you on your toes and thinking about what these people had to do to survive. I would recommend this story to anyone who likes to read about the past and enjoys stories of survival. I ejoyed it very much and hope all future readers will too.-Diane
4,This is a GREAT book!,"I read ""No Pretty Pictures"". It is written by Anita Lobel. It is a story about a girl who is hiding from the Nazis. She is with only her Christian nanny and her brother, who must dress like a girl. It is about her trying to survive the Holocaust. One of the good things about this book is that it's written in diary form so it is easy to read. I thought it was a very well-written book. If you would like to see the Holocaust through a young Jewish girl's eyes, I would highly recommend this book."
5,Fantastic,I loved this book even the cover. I hope that people would read this because this book is very touching and gives you a great look at what happened to children during WWII and how it is sooo hard to surivive. Anita does a great job of showing and explaining her difficult time. This book was very touching and I would recammend this to anyone!!
5,No Pretty Pictures,"No Pretty Pictures is one of the best books I've read. It is captivating. It tells the story of a young girl and her little brother trying to make it through the halocaust. Their father left to find work and there mother left them with there Nana. After numerous hiding spots, they are caught and sent to a prison. From there they go to Plazow to Auchwitz. The last third of the book they are in a center for children with tuberculosis. Later, Anita (the girl and author) waits in a camp for orphans while her brother recovers. It ends right before there whole family goes to America."
3,A Cool Classic View Of The Human Psyche,One of the earlier but greatest episodes of the original series
3,Promising Episode That Doesn't Quite Deliver,"Morgan Woodward's standout performance in the first half of this episode makes this an episode worth owning. His character is initially very frightening, but eventually emerges as a character to sympathize. It is a a very effective performance.Unfortunately, the episode becomes rather silly as Kirk and a none-too-bright psychiatrist, Dr. Helen Noel, investigate the penal colony. After such a brilliant set-up, this story line becomes disappointing. Still, an adequate entry in the Star Trek series.This is the first episode that uses the Vulcan mind meld."
5,"Thoughts on ""Dagger of the Mind""","This is one of the better episodes from the first season. There are several things to like about this episode: First, this episode introduces us to the Vulcan mind meld. Second, Morgan Woodward gives a great performance as Dr. Simon Van Gelder, a psychiatrist whose mind has been dominated by the neural neutralizer. Also, Marianna Hill, who plays Enterprise psychiatrist Dr. Helen Noel, looks absolutely teriffic in her blue mini-skirted Starfleet uniform (which just happens to be a bit too short in the back). Helen playfully flirts with Captain Kirk during their initial encounter in the transporter room and on the surface of the planet, making Kirk visibly uncomfortable (one of the few times that a female actually gets the better of Kirk)."
3,This episode gets a B- grade and is ranked 36th out of 80,"When Dr. Simon van Gelder, part of the psychiatric staff at the Tantalus Penal Colony escapes to the U.S.S. Enterprise, exhibiting signs of manic insanity, an enraged McCoy insists that Kirk investigate the colony. The Captain reminds McCoy of Tantalus' excellent reputation, but McCoy is unconvinced. Kirk and Dr. Helen Noel, the U.S.S. Enterprise's psychiatrist, tour the facility. They discover that the Colony director, Dr. Tristan Adams, has been using a brainwashing device, the neural neutralizer, to control not only the colony's inmates, but his staff, as well. When the doctor realizes that Kirk has discovered his secret, he convinces the captain to try the machine for himself, to prove that it is perfectly safe. The result is that Kirk falls madly in love with Helen Noel and the two remain on the Colony as Adams' prisoners."
2,Not much help,This book had lots of beautiful quilts but not much in the way of how to information. Not worth the money.
2,Not enough photo memory quilt ideas,"I was mainly after photo memory quilt ideas and this only has a small chapter on that. It deals with more quilt block, friendship block quilts."
1,"NOT ARRIVE, NOT RATE","They may try to SEND THE PRODUCT, VERY INTERESTED CONTINUOUS.My address:AURA Sanguillen.Turrialba, BARRIO RECOPE.ZIP CODE 7150.CARTAGO,COSTA RICA"
2,Rubber grip handle,"Product works fine.. Only problem is that they do not glue on the rubber handle on the end of the pole.. I was at my local beach out in the water scrubbing the hull when I noticed that the handle came off and was lost.. This assist the unit in floating by keeping air locked in the pole.. Anyhow, the thing does still float except the handle end sinks and just the brush is at the top of the water."
2,Wrong vehicle,They sent ones for an F150 which had to be returned. None available for an escape. I wasted some time but did get my money back.
4,Gets the job done,"The clamps work well. However, they seem to not be meant to hold the racks up vertically. They hold then at a slight angle. FYI..."
5,Bad Breath ... GONE!,"I got this for my Yorkie since it seems like she always has bad breath. I tried brushing her teeth with just plain water but after her next meal, her breath gets bad once again. After I tried C.E.T. Tartar Control Enzymatic Toothpaste, Beef Flavor, I have to admit, I'm quite amazed! Bad breath gone! That fast! I noticed the difference after the first use!Although it's still hard to make my Yorkie feel comfortable in brushing her teeth, I'm just happy that she now doesn't have bad breath! Whew! :)"
3,"basic info only, dated as to info",The book is fine if all you need is basic information. This was an older book and some information was out of date.
4,Nice Sticks,I like these very much and for the price they are a bargan. Although i do prefer AHEAD stcks you just can't beat em'. :)
2,REALLY HARD TO USE,This rain gauge is really hard to set and use. It has to be absolutely level to measure rain. I had to log on to the website to get through some of the set up problems. If it didn't cost more to return it than its worth I would do it. I thought this one would be better than the LaCrosse I had before. I will purchase another cheap LaCrosse and be happy again.
4,Very good product,"I have purchased three Oregon Scientific rain gauges, all are different models. The first I purchased three years ago as a gift for my son. I liked it so well I purchased one for myself. I purchased a third this Christmas for a friend who admired mine. I recommend them highly."
1,I have not received item yet (over 2 months) and seller did not respond to my email.,I have not received item yet (over 2 months) and seller did not respond to my email. I do not suggest to buy items from this seller!!!
1,NEVER AGAIN,"Oregon Scientific RGR126 Cable Free Long Range Rain GaugePRODUCT DIDN'T WORK AS ADVERTISED AND ALL OREGON WOULD DO TO HELP WAS TO SEND ME ANOTHER OF THE SAME PIECE OF JUNK AS A REPLACEMENT. THEY REFUSED TO UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE, EVEN FOR ADDTIONAL FEES. SO, I PAID SHIPPING TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY STILL CHARGED ME A 20% RETURN FEE. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NON-CARING. BACK TO LACROSSE PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH."
1,IT NEVER WORKED!!!I,"I was given this for Christmas and it has never worked. If you could, would you send me complete directions for setting it up? Jane"
4,It actually works! No LaCrosse interference.,"Instructions are clear and first trial measured 1.54 inches of rain. Biggest complaint is 8 very small screws to remove to put in 2 ""AA"" batteries. Also be careful with the mounting screws, I twisted one in two and had to go find another similar screw. I currently have a LaCrosse wireless temperature gauge and there is no apparent interference. I'd recommend it to a friend."
5,"Quality, accurate, and a great buy.","Compared to another generic wireless rain gauge that I had bought (which never actually worked), this Oregon Scientific model feels like a quality product the minute you pick it up. It was easy to setup, with only a few screws to unscrew to get the batteries in; I'd say that I had the batteries in and the unit mounted outside in probably 15 minutes. And, it works great. I have the gauge at about its max of 100ft away from the receiver unit and have yet to ever lose the connection, even through torrential rain.My only beef with this is that it doesn't have indoor/outdoor thermometer capability added in like some of these models do. However, on functionality and ease of use, this model really is a great deal for the ~$35 I paid. I don't see how a more expensive model could be better than this less expensive model."
2,Stopped Working,"After a year and a half, the unit has quit working. The total and current rain displays continue to blink. Customer Service for Oregon Scientific have not responded."
2,rain gauge,"I got this for my husband for Xmas and he cannot figure out how to make it work. He's read the directions over and over...it's still not working. And he's good at figuring these things out, but not this for some reason. If anyone has any suggestions let me know."
2,"bah, waste of my money",my 3 1/2 year old can play alot of games by himself. with this game he constantly needs my help. its hard to manuver the. and game is very laggy. don't waste your...buy putt putt instead.
2,Definetly keeps everyone out!,I had to purchase a new safe due to a break in where I had the same particular Style tube safe.. The old model had the full size number dial where this one is the size of a half dollar.. Very small if you have it in ground or in a concrete box. I donnot encourage anyone to buy this safe unless you have 15-20 min of time to open it... It is also a 4 number safe that you cannot change and the directions are ridiculus!!! Spend the extra bucks and get an upgrade!!!
3,Reasonable for the price,"I have the safe in the house we just bought, wouldn't have bought one normally, but it is in the house so we have it.What is good about it is that it not going anywhere. As part of the foundation it is pretty much a part of the house.What isn't so good about it is the dial. It is not that easy to turn, maybe it was when it was new but after years it is difficult. What is more difficult is the space between the numbers. You have to be pretty much spot on for each number or it wont open, and given a hard to turn dial and very close numbers it can lead to you having to try more than once to get it right.Also the cover is not as sturdy as I would have like it to be. It has warped some from being stepped on and would have been better if the cover was sturdier."
4,I'm a fan of Patrick J. Adams,"I bought this movie solely because Patrick J Adams was the lead actor. After watching the trailer and teaser scenes I thought one of the characters would have a larger appearance throughout the movie but they didn't. I wasn't so much disappointed as I was curious as to why it seemed that way to begin with.I wouldn't consider myself a film buff nor a casual movie goer, but somewhere in the middle, and this movie was interesting to say the least. The acting is well done, as well as the camera work. I believe that the quality of Independent films are beginning to surpass the big Hollywood-budget films simply because of the heart being put into the work. The Waterhole fits into my belief. It's nice to see people doing things because they have faith and put heart in their work, and it's clear the entire cast and crew felt this way making this movie."
5,An extremely moving and relatable movie with a kick.,"The Waterhole is a provacitve and smartly written film that focuses on the confusion many of us face when we are in the purgatory phase of trying to decide what to do with the rest our lives. The lead actor does an excellent job portraying an intelligent but floundering young man trying to break free of the bar filled life he has surrounded himself with. He is so likable that you find yourself rooting for him even when his dark side is leading the way. It's a clever, funny, thoughtful movie that everyone can identify with and you may even come away with a renewed since of hope."
4,Great white noise machine,"We use this sound machine for our 9 month old's room to help him sleep through the random sounds that we can hear through the walls in our apartment. It works really well, is very portable, and our son now associates the sound with calming down and falling asleep. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it could adjust to be a little louder than it is, although it seems to be working out for our little guy regardless. Maybe the sleep machine that is the next step up from this one and is more expensive is louder. I'm not sure. This one has good volume, but it isn't as loud as the fan I had been using before we bought this so that's why I noticed the difference. Overall, this is a great little machine and has been worth every penny for us."
5,Surprisingly Amazing!,"I have always been an individual who finds it difficult to sleep in a quiet environment. What I used to use was a fan, however, in the winter months, this doesn't work very well. A friend purchased this machine for me and I was skeptical at first. NOW, I can't sleep without it and take it where ever I travel. The white noise is amazing! Makes you sleep like a baby. The ability to control how soft or loud you want the white noise to be is a great feature about this machine. I was actually surprised that a machine that just makes ONE sound could be so effective. Many go for the machines that have RAINFOREST, OCEAN, or CRICKET noises. This trumps them ALL. I recommend this machine to anyone. I have so far purchased two more machines for my family members. I am sure they will do the same for others. GREAT and SURPRISINGLY AMAZING machine."
4,Just what I was looking for.,"I had been using humidifiers in my childrens rooms for the past couple of years so they have gotten used to the sound. However, the cost of filters and the possibility of mold and mildew in the room had become a big concern for me. This sounds equal to a humidifier or a fan and can be turned up and down slightly. Though I do think that if somebody is looking to block out the noise of a snoring partner or something within the same room - this would not cut it."
4,does what it is supposed to,Very basic sound machine with steady fairly loud noise. You moderate the noise by turning the plastic casing to cover or reveal the slits in the side and the holes on top. The noise is either moderate or loud (there is no quiet). The sound is a steady thrum without any variation.
5,Restful Sleep,My partner now sleeps soundly despite my snoring. There may be concern for alleged RF emissions. Ours whirs seven feet from the foot of the bed.
3,Pretty good white noise,"We bought this machine for our baby's room, which faces a busy street. In does a decent job, but all-in-all I think I like sound of a fan better. I read quite a few of these reviews and found some people who think it's too loud, and others who think it's not loud enough. I think the real issue is the pitch of the sound, which is noticeably higher than the sound of the fan, so it doesn't do a great job masking low-pitch noise. Perhaps the larger model would do a better job. I would recommend finding a place where you can hear it for yourself before buying it."
3,Not conducive to good sleep,"There is a fine line between white noise and just plain noise. For me, this product fell into the ""just plain noise"" category. No matter how I adjusted it, it did not provide a comfortable background noise that allowed me to sleep. I returned it and the return process was very easy. Amazon is to be commended for that."
4,White noise,"I bought two of these machines. Both my daughters bought this also. My daughters use it in their children's rooms to cut out the outside noises and it soothes them to sleep. The continue to use their view monitors and sound so the won't miss anything that may be troubling going on. My husband and i use ours to cover up the early morning barking of a dog. It works great and is so compact. My husband is on a sleep apnea machine and it covers up that noise. If your husband snores, it will help cover that noise also. My daughter tells me that the cheaper model is just as good as the more expensive one. I'm enjoying our machines. I put them in two parts of the room. Great!! If someone breaks into our house, I would just as soon not know it as I wouldn't want to have to confront an intruder. If you are asleep, they may just leave without bothering you."
5,This was great,I bought this to use in my 1-1/2 year old's bedroom at night. We live in a very old house that has a lot of squeaky floors. I was hesitant to buy this because a lot of reviews said the amount of sound was not adequate but I have found that it works very well. I also like the fact that it is a mechanical noise and not a recorded track so it sounds more natural.
5,quiet please!,I bought the Sleepmate 580A mainly because of reading the positive reviews.The product works well for me when I want to take a nap or go to bed at night to drown our or mask noises coming from adjacent apartments and parking lot noises.I normally turn on my bedside radio to try to mask outside noise but the radio does not work as well as the Sleepmate.
5,Awesome,This replaced having a loud fan in my room for sound ... no more blowing dust ... the sound is perfect for me to sleep! Just luv it!
4,Sleep...how I have missed you!,"I purchased this product because the amount of noise in my neighborhood is unreal. It seems like there are dogs barking all night (and they sound like they are right in my backyard), people with loud exhausts and stereo systems hauling butt through the streets and endless parties with bass booming. Being a light sleeper, I was not getting very much sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills, which I really don't like to take. So, I purchased this machine. The machine is easy to adjust to different settings, it's small and looks decent in my room. It does not drown out the above noises completely, but it makes the noises quieter. Basically, if there is racket going on outside, it seems far away, instead of like it's happening in my backyard! So, I've finally been able to get a month's worth of good night sleeps! :)"
3,Works well but has a short lifespan,"I had to buy a new sound condition because my other one broke after 2 years of use. I was a little disappointed with the life of this product, but I need it for my 2-year old daughter to sleep so I bought it again."
5,Saves my sleep!!,"I purchased one of these a few years ago after hearing about it from a friend (I've always needed a fan to sleep, but live in a dry climate and the fan is terrible) and absolutely love it. I just purchased this for my dad, who has troubles sleeping and I can't wait to give it to him for Christmas. It's a gift he won't buy himself but I know he'll love it. I got my sister hooked on them, who originally purchased one for her newborn (now 2 and sleeps like a baby with it still) and then got one for her own room. We can't say enough great things about the calmness of the sound machine. My only complaint would be that after I traveled with mine something came lose inside and now the machine makes a faint clicking sound. My husband has taken it apart but can not figure out what's making the noise. My sister, however, has traveled with hers over and over again and has not had this problem."
4,Helps Cover Up The Snoring...,"First of all I am a very light sleeper, waking up at the slightest of sounds. My darling wife can emit some pretty ferocious snoring so I thought this sound conditioner might prevent separate beds. I can say after one night of use that it is definitely a keeper and after some 'getting used to time', this just might be the magic bullet. By the way, this would be a 5 star item if it had a remote that you could keep by your bed side so you could turn the unit on after the TV was turned off. Who wants to get out of bed after the sand man attacks?"
4,Good option,"I like the sound machine, but it is not as loud as everyone on the reviews claims it to be....I would opt for the two speed (i'm guessing the two speed offers a louder option) if you're looking for a very loud white noise machine. I got this for my son, and so far, so good. However, it is not the loud, ""cover all"" noise maker that it was described as. In fact, the ConAir a friend has is much louder.....but I needed something that stayed on all night. Guess you have to pick your battles. Good option for an always on sound machine for babies."
2,Marpac Sound Screen 580A Sound Conditioner Single Speed,This item is quite loud - much more so than I ever expected. I hear a high-pitched oscillating whine from it. I have tried all sorts of adjustments with it.This particular unit may just be defective. I am going to return/exchange it for a different 2-stage Marpac model.It arrived in a timely fashion with no damage at all.
2,"died after 1.5 years of use, is this normal?","i purchased this in April of 2010 and used it off and on ever since and the other day it just died. Is there any warranty of these? more than a year? going to look for my original paperwork...thought it woud last longer than this. Albeit, did the job just great when it was working! :)"
2,Stopped working after 14 months,Took the cover off and it's a fan inside. No user serviceable parts. For that kind of money I expected a longer lifespan.
2,"Oops, someone forgot the listening test","It's well built, I'll say that. Quality construction. But apparently no one gave it a listening test before putting it on the market. What does it sound like? A cheap bathroom fan comes to mind. Another shortcoming is that the volume range is very limited. C'mon, Marpac, you can do a better job."
4,Useful and comforting,"First used to block sound for day-sleeper, we later bought another to help with baby fussing not waking our toddler. Now, in a new house, we bought another for the older kids room, so they're not bothered by noises of doing dishes or watching TV at night. I thought the ""one in every room, can't sleep without it"" was ridiculous when I first investigated the product, but now I agree. The world needs a little background white noise. I wish it were cheaper, but I'm willing to pay it (several times, apparently). I recommend it to everyone I can."
5,Pick this Sound Machine!!,"We purchased this for our baby who is now 7 months old. We give it a perfect 5 out of 5 because it is a great sound machine/white noise maker. It is running nearly all day because we put it on for him to sleep for his naps and through the night. It has worked flawlessly.Our neighbor has three small boys and their play area is right outside our sons window. They can make quite a racket, but he sleeps right through it.If you are looking for a way to either soothe yourself to sleep or block out noise, buy this sound machine. It has proved helpful not only to use for our infant, but also for us on trips to family, relatives or even hotels. The white noise has soothed us all to sleep!I have no cons to offer. We even are going to purchase another one for our room!"
5,Love it!,"My husband and I have had a Sleepmate sound maching for years (same machine for over 15 years) and we love it. We bought two more to put in our kids rooms (ages 5 and 9 months). The little one doesn't wake the 5 year old in the night and vice versa. These machines are wonderful. We also take them with us on trips to help everyone sleep better away from home. It's a nice steady sound and doesn't sound ""electronic"" like some of the other types of noise machines."
5,Puts me and my Daughter Asleep,Since having this product I've noticed a big difference in helping me and especially my daughter get to and stay asleep. I used to use a small fan as I've known about the benefits of white noise and sleep for years. But with the winter having come I didn't want her to get chilled. I also have experienced mechanical vs. recorded white noise and there is no contest in favor of the mechanical. After a while the recorded will actually bug you and wake you up. In any case unless this product suddenly breaks down I have nothing but good things to say about it. I find it funny that some have complained it doesn't make enough sound. I actually find it a bit loud but keep it on the other side of the room as suggested and it works great. I heartily recommend this product to anyone needing help with sleeping and or blocking other distracting noises. Sweet Dreams : )
4,Definitely helps block out other noises so I get a good night's sleep,"I have a Great Pyrenees, a nocturnal, guardian dog breed, who barks a lot at night. I want her to protect me and my other two dogs at night, but her barking was keeping me awake. The ""white noise"" sound machine has really helped me get a good night's sleep, yet doesn't block out all noise, so I'm not worried that I wouldn't wake up if there was some kind of emergency. Because I have a home office, I also use the machine during the day at times to tone down the noises of neighbors' dogs, cars, etc. so I am able to concentrate and get my work done. This is a very helpful machine at an affordable price."
5,A good nights sleep!,I'm amazed at how this works...even more so now that I've been getting at least 8 hours sleep at night. Impressive for such a small machine!!!
1,Just a distraction,"After reading all the rave reviews, I thought this would be the solution to living in the apartment below two young children who are constantly running on their hardwood floors above me. This machine does NOT block the sound. It masks it a bit by giving the mind something else to focus on, but I can definitely still hear the noise. I am very disappointed in this product. It doesn't block outside noise either--I could still hear the leaf blowers loud and clear."
1,A poor product,This is an extremely poor product. I returned it immediately. It is noisier than my window air conditioner. The two volume controls are virtually useless.The only reason I gave it one star is because the Amazon system would not allow no stars.
1,Releases A LOT of electromagnetic radiation,"I love the sound of this product. However, I am giving it one star because it releases A LOT of electromagnetic radiation. I use a Gauss meter to measure electromagnetic radiation for all my electrical objects -- especially the ones I sleep next to for many hours.I measured the Marpac Sleepmate and was atonished to see the meter go off the charts. I thought maybe I had a defective sound machine so I checked another Marpac Sleepmate and found the same problem. I have an electronic (non mechanical) sound machine (Sound Oasis) and it showed very little electromagnetic radiation.I prefer the sound and the quality of the Marpac to the Sound Oasis, but the amount of radiation is just too high to justify its use for so many hours at night."
5,A must for two kids sharing a room,"I have two children that are a year and a half apart. When it was time for my baby to move into the room with his brother, this machine was such a help. They were waking each other up and we had a number of sleepless nights. This sound machine made enough white noise to keep one sleeping when the other was fussing or when I came in to feed the baby. It has been a lifesaver in helping the two sleep in the same room. I highly recommend it."
4,Luving it!,I rent my basement out to a friend and he has different hours than I do. I kept waking up to noises from downstairs. I put this in and it has helped me a lot - masks the noises. Took a few nights to adjust to it; also used in hotels when I travel and does great at helping me sleep. Like it a loT!
3,Not effective against high and low range sounds,"The device works as described, but unfortunately was ineffective against the problem I was trying to solve. If the noise you want to block out is in a mid-range frequency (for instance constant engine noise, or music in another room), this will probably work well for you. But my issue is the sound of garbage pick-up outside my NYC windows. The high-frequency clinking of glass and the low-frequency truck noises cut right through the white noise. I returned it."
4,"It's fine, wish it had a bigger range of ""noise""","This product seems to be working fine. Several comments suggested it was ""too loud"" or ""not loud enough,"" even when fully adjusted one way or the other. I agree--I wish it was louder. One thing I did that helped was to remove the foam cushion on the bottom of the device--it does not have any scratchy surfaces so that was not a concern.We have two fans in the house--one is a floor model and one is a table-top model. Just for comparison, the ""Marpac"" device is maybe only half as loud as either of those two fans--it only creates the same amount of sound, in my opinion, as one of those small clip-on fans.This device is definitely more portable than a fan, though, which is great for travel.If anyone finds a similar device to the Marpac that's louder, or if Marpac comes out with another model, please post to the discussion."
5,Best sleep aid,Better than any medication. I can't sleep without out it. Can turn it to make it louder or softer. Small enough to hide if you find it unattractive and to bring on vacation.
5,perfect white noise,"This review is short and simple because I couldn't ask for a better product.The Marpac Sound Screen is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn't come with an array of silly sounds: ocean, rain, jungle, etc. Instead, it produces a white noise which can be adjusted to produce a louder or softer tone as you prefer. It works as a great masking device for all general house noises. Couldn't be happier."
5,Bought another for 2nd baby!,"My first born would know it's time to sleep when this was on. So a good nights sleep can be taken anywhere, hotels, trips, and grandmas house. My now 3 yr old didn't want to give hers up so I had to get another for her brother. It also hides housecsounds after bedtime, no need to worry about waking the baby."
4,Good for noisy neighbors,It works to help drown out the television and loud conversations of noisy neighbors so I can get to sleep with a quiet air type of humming. Not a harsh sound like a loud waterfall or annoying white noise from a television. A great value for the price. I was unnecessarily tormented for years. Now I get to sleep!
5,this is my 3rd one,"we have 3 of these in our house, 2 of them are over 10 years old. my son has one in his room and we have 2 in the master. great white noise, just sounds like air blowing. use them to sleep and drown out random night noises. great product, worth the price, they last forever."
4,Good for Sleeping Baby,"Our circa 1923 house has terrible squeaky wood floors, and all of our kids walk like elephants, so it is really tricky to keep a baby asleep. After reading reviews on several sleep-machine products, we decided the SleepMate 580A sounded like our best bet. We have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and we are very satisfied. It sounds a lot like a vaporizer running. I honestly expect to feel a cool mist when I walk past it. In our opinion, it is too loud to have right in our 12x12 bedroom, but the amount of noise it makes sitting right outside the door is perfect. You can still hear all of the other noises in the house (I still know when our teenage son gets home at night.), but the constant humming keeps other noises from being such a jolt to your system and waking you up. I really do think the baby is sleeping better. I would recommend this for anyone trying to sleep through noisy situations."
2,too loud,"it has a great sound but is just too loud. Although adjustable, sound on lowest level is still too loud."
5,Perfect!,I needed a noise machine for my 10 month olds room and my 2 year olds room. We had guests(loud) in our house for 1 month and I wanted my children to keep their nap schedule! This noise machine worked perfectly! The guest are gone and I am still using them in their rooms!
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for something that was a little more quiet, this unit is very noisy, if you are trying to use it in a bedroom setting it is almost impossible to sleep with it on as even on the quiet setting it is very loud."
3,"Good, but dual-speed is better","I purchased this after a friend recommended it. I returned mine for the dual-speed version. The single-speed is just fine, produces a soothing sound and offers plenty of tone control, but its one speed is somewhere at or near the dual-speed's ""high"" setting. I prefer a quieter volume, which the dual-speed model produces very well."
4,"My kids sleep great, don't get dried out!","We are a fan sleeping family. We love/need white noise. In the winter, I hate using fans because it dries them out and we've had troubles with nose bleeds. These are great!!!! My kids sleep all night long, I can have a good noise level that drowns out unwanted noise, but am still able to hear if my kids wake up crying. Worth purchasing and will probably never use a fan again!"
1,not soothing for me,"This sound machine just makes one kind of noise, and to me it was jarring and anxiety provoking. The subtle adjustments in volume were not enough to change that. It still sounded like a jet engine. Instead I went for the Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver which gives me a relaxed feel and has many sound choices."
2,Does not drown out coworker in cube next door.,"I have a coworker in the cubicle next to mine who chomps on gum for hours on end without break. It's quite disgusting and makes me ill. I bought this machine to drown her out. Unfortunately, I can still hear her incessant gum smacking and obnoxious chewing sounds despite the fact that this machine is so loud that it makes my head hurt."
5,Sleeping again!,"This little machine has been a life saver. Noises from outside and inside the house (long term house guest that snores) were keeping us up. Based on the positive reviews here on Amazon, I ordered this and it's worked perfectly. We don't have to set it to anywhere near the total volume for it to drown out those annoying sounds that keep you awake. It's also small enough that we plan to take it with us when traveling. Great purchase and well worth the money!"
4,This works for my baby!,"I love this thing it works almost as well as the vacuum to calm my 3 month old. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes I wish it was a little louder. That being said, it still blocks out a loud 2 yr old, traffic, loud talking and our dog! It's well worth the money and I'd buy it again. This is used by a baby that wasnt calmed by music or nature sounds..."
1,Sleepmate 580A,"Product broke down in the first 30 days. Instead of white noise, it produced a loud clanking sound. This was disapointing since I had used the same item (borrowed from a friend) with much better results.Marpac 580A SleepMate & SoundMate White Noise Generator"
1,Didn't help,"Not only was this product unhelpful, but there was no way to adjust the noise level. One size fits all I guess - just didn't work for me."
4,Helps me to get a good night sleep,I have to get a good night sleep and makes feel better to succeed in school.
5,Great for Kiddos! Exactly what I wanted,This is the second Sleepmate we have purchased. We have one in each of our kids rooms. Portable enough to travel too. Very pleased!
5,Slept like a baby,"This was the best $40 I have spent in a long time. I sleep with an air purifier at home and when I travel, I can't sleep because it's too quiet! I had 2 business trips and a vacation planned when I decided to purchase this. It has worked out fabulous so far. The machine creates a fan like noise, which is exactly what I needed. It is adjustable in terms of volume. I read reviews on other products and was concerned about a pattern in the other machines. This provides white noise of a fan and a sound night's sleep."
5,Great Sleep Machine,"I had purchased the same product with two speeds, however, that was unnessesary. This one with just the one speed was perfect!!! We love the Sleepmate, and use it everyday!"
5,Great product!!,"The Sleep-Mate I'd used almost every night (even taking it with me when I traveled) for the past 26+ years recently bit the dust and I couldn't get a new one ordered fast enough! My old one was the 2-speed, but after reading the reviews I decided to go with the less expensive single speed and I could not be happier. I think the newer ones must be a little quieter than my old one because I used my old one on low and it sounded about the same as this ones does (which, according to other reviewers, is the same as ""high"" on the new dual speed ones). I think the fan-like sound is very soothing and does a great job masking other noises. I'm not a fan of those sound machines that make waterfall, cricket, ocean, etc. sounds. I find those extremely annoying and they don't drown out other noises - but THIS machine I love! I'm curious to see how long this one will last, because if it holds up even a fraction as long as my other one did it will be well worth the price."
2,Too loud,"My intent for buying this was for use in exam rooms in a clinic to drown out outside noise when the pt was waiting in the room. I 'trialed' it in my office which lasted less than 3 hours. It was much too loud, and annoying. I ended up with a headache, along with my co-worker outside my office. She referred to it as ""like being in a wind tunnel""It worked as stated, I imagined it would be a more pleasant sound for some reason."
1,Not loud enough,"I hsd to return this equipment because the sound was not enough to mask the noise I wanted it to mask, even in the high setting."
3,Noisy,I bought three of these o use in an office where privacy is needed. The staff hav them outside their dors and hen more than one is running it is loud in the outer office.
5,Good product!,"Bought as a gift; user/recipient delighted with item. Exactly as advertised, shipped promptly, Purchaser and user both happy with item!"
5,great to drown out noise from neighborhood dogs,"This does an excellent job of drowning out the noise from barking dogs in the neighborhood. I imagine it would be also useful for when you sleep in a hotel and there's people walking around in the hallways and opening/closing doors when you sleep, so I'll likely bring it with me when I travel next."
5,Great white noise machine,We own two of these machines. No complaints. Great machine. Easy to use. Solid construction. Just the right amount of white noise.
3,Sleepmate,"Item works well, but is not quite loud enough. If you sleep with a snorer, it will not drown out the noise!"
3,Soothing white sound - but no volume control,"This is the second Marpac unit I have owned. The first one developed an annoying rattle after a couple of years use, so this is the replacement. The first unit was used in a bedroom with carpet, and the volume was fine on a night stand beside the bed. Since we have moved, the new unit is in a bedroom with hardwood floors and the volume is so loud we had to put the unit on the other side of the room on a table farthest away from the bed. It is still very loud, even with all the air ports closed down. I think an electronic unit with an adjustable volume may be better suited for our environment, so keep that in mind when choosing your type of sound machine."
4,Does the job,"Got used to the sound of my vaporizer, but it eventually began putting out a moldy odor so I needed to get rid of it, but the silence was not conducive to sleeping soundly. Just wanted a basic little sound machine--no waves or birds, or jungle. This does the job. At first it seemed a bit too loud so I put it on the counter top of my adjoining bath and that was fine. But now I only notice it when I fail to turn it on. If it keeps on running for several years. I will be happy."
5,Love it! But Pricey.,"Super product! We can't sleep without some white noise and this is loud enough to drown out most household and outside noises. I like its compact size as it will be perfect to take on overnight trips. Although I thought it was expensive, I will likely buy at least one more."
5,Last Forever!,"I have a model 454 that must be at least 30 years old, and it keeps on going. I've tried electric white noise makers over the years, but they just aren't the same. Can't really explain why, they just aren't. When mine finally conks out, I'm definitely going to get another one! I live in a noisy area, a bad one too with gunshots, loud cars, noisy neighbors and the like, and this unit does an amazing job keeping the noises down.Just did a Google search for the model 454, I got this...""It is billed as, ""Sleep-Mate"" by Marpac of Wilmington, N.C.. It is model number 454.This item is circa the 1960's. ""1960's!!! Wow, guess it's lasted longer than I thought!"
5,The ratings were right!,"I live off of a very busy street and my home happens to be right next to both a shipping train line and public transit train line. Add the noise of a snoring husband, and I was desperate. Earplugs kept hurting my ears when they were not giving me infections. I slept so well the very first night. Even my dog seemed to sleep better. I am so very happy with this purchase."
2,Noise not so white after 6 months,"I purchased this product just under 7 months ago. At first it worked normally, projecting a smooth white noise sound. Recently the white is being drowned out by a grinding/crackly type noise. As it is too late to return with Amazon, I will be asking the manufacturer for a replacement."
4,The best-- just wish it were louder,"There is no better product on the market that I know of. Far better than digital devices. If you are an extremely sensitive sleeper, you may need two."
3,Not loud enough for us,"This is a nice little machine if you travel or if space is an issue. If you have never used a fan or white noise machine to help you sleep, it might be enough for you. We are used to the noise that a Honeywill HEPA air cleaner makes, which is quite a bit louder. The Marpac 580A has one speed: High (loud) but it didn't mask the sound of the TV in the next room, a party next door, or cars revving their engines outside. We returned it and bought a new air cleaner. It was more expensive, heavier and larger (the size of an ottoman) but I guess we need the ""turbo"" speed noise."
2,"Good sound, but not loud enough.","Had high hopes for this. It's compact enough to travel with and only makes one sound...white noise. To that end, it is fine, but it isn't loud enough to block the external noise by our house. Plus, could still hear television downstairs even when running. Would have been great if the thing would have gone a little louder."
5,"Works much better than Ambien, Benedryl, and Melatonin!!!",This simple little machine has made such a huge difference in the quality of my sleep. The alarm clock is no longer my enemy! The dogs even sleep better!
4,Not a snoring blocker,"Well, I purchased to help me sleep when my fiancee starts his snoring. It doesn't do the trick for that, but it is very soothing. I'm keeping it! I don't like sleeping in silence. In the summer, we usually run a fan, but now that it's cold, this is a nice replacement."
1,Beware the bait and switch,"Please be aware that if you are buying this CD for the titles listed, you will be surely disappointed. I was shipped a DIFFERENT CD THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED and the only explanation that I could get was that I should read the description further. PS. My rating is for the customer service, not the CD that i received. It has great music, just not what I ordered."
2,"Great list of songs, bad quality CD","Reading other review I sohould reinforce the alert on this label. I bought this CD and one of the tracks was deffective. The quality of the recordirg is just reasonable, it is not that bad but it is not a brilliant remasterization. The track list is superb but be careful with what you will gonna get, it might desapoint you in terms of audio quality. A shame as the songs are great."
4,It's still a great collection,"It's true, you will get the wrong CD, but only because it was a mispress! Everything looks right, even the label on the CD, but what you'll actually get is Disco Collector vol. 1 (unless they made a second pressing with the correct contents). Disco fluff aside, you'll get full 12"" mixes with decent sound quality overall. The liner notes claim some remastering, though a few of the songs sound like they were recorded directly from vinyl (including crackles and surface noise). In any case, there are a few rare jams here.The track listing for Disco Collector vol. 1 is here:DISCO COLLECTOR"
5,Great resource,"This book is a must-read for anyone caught up in a season of seduction or someone who has come out of one. I also recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand how a devoted believer can enter into a season of seduction. I did this study after I had come out of a season of seduction, and it gave me so much insight as to how I got where I had been, where the red flags were that I had brushed aside, and the lies that I had told myself. Doing this workbook helped me in my healing process and has made me passionate about helping others through the healing process and trying to prevent others from making the same mistakes I made."
5,Beautiful and Powerful!,"Christopher dominates this work. And surprisingly, I liked the non-English versions best. Especially the Italian.Powerful. Sweeping.Wish it were more widely available. An Mp3 of the album would be great!"
4,Something for everyone,"While everyone has their own taste and surely will not like the work of every author included, there is something here for everyone that is a Middle Earth fan. Most notably I find the work of Ted Nasmith, John Howe, Alan Lee, and Robert Goldsmith enjoyable. A big bonus as a fan of the History of Middle Earth and the Silmarillion were the images from those times by John Howe and Roger Garland."
2,Uninspired,"I found the artwork to be generally uninspired and substandard.There are a few nice pics in here, but generally, not worthy of mostpeople's bookselves and definitely not a coffee table book.I am disappointed with this purchase."
2,Uninspired,"I found the artwork to be generally uninspired and substandard. There are a few nice pics in here, but generally, not worthy of most people's bookselves and definitely not a coffee table book.I am disappointed with this purchase."
2,Not worth the money.,My mother and I had brought this book for my dad and we were really excited because my father is a big J.R.R. Tolkien. The paintings that you get to see in preview were great but when we got the book and my dad opened it he was disappointed and so was my mother and I. They are really ugly. I don't think it's worth the money honestly.
5,A difference in interpretations,"I enjoyed this book greatly. However, some people may have been dissapointed in that the paintings may not have coincided with the world they pictured in their imagination. Tolkien's masterful use of the English language and powerful descriptions are done justice in many of these paintings. I find that anyone who has read Tolkien's works forms a very distinct picture in their mind. Even though I may not have visualized some of the scenes and landscapes as they have been portrayed, I found seeing other's interpretations to be an interesting experience. I personaly enjoyed the paintings by John Howe, Ted Nasmith, and Alan Lee."
2,A Disappointment,"I was excited when I ordered this book, but the first time I looked through it I was hugely disappointed. Only a few of the paintings in the book do any sort of justice to the imagery, whether implied or described, in Tolkien's books. Many of the paintings are by Michael Hague, and his style does not appeal to me at all. Roger Garland's paintings are elegant, tasteful, and mythical, especially the last one in the book, which I think is just perfect. I also like John Howe's paintings, as well as a couple by Alan Lee and Ted Nasmith. The rest (which comprise the majority) seem chunky, futuristic (certainly not the way I or anyone else I know of thinks of Tolkien's books) and boring. They do not capture the mystery, magic, tragedy, joy, sorrow, or beauty we are all acquainted with in Tolkien's works."
1,Doesn't Work for Me,I tried a couple of the spells but nothing happened. I think this book is bogus.
3,ok,granted I purchased this at a very low price so I didn't expect it to be quality. It arrived in dodgy condition.... (the sewn seam didn't cover the fabric overlay in a few spots but again for less than $2 or $3 whatever). I had hopped it would fit my wireless jabra headset but my headset ear wrap piece made the unit too wide to fit so I use the case instead for my earbuds that I keep at my work desk- they don't get tangled with pens and they are now easy to find :) It's also easy to throw in my purse when I know I'll need headphones and I've used it to make a USB impossible to misplace too - the loop on it is great for attaching to my keys and hot pink is difficult not to spot :)
5,Its Real,"Searching Internet videos We now know cancer Is mostly caused by parasites as fungus and viruses also We found out Baking Soda helps cure cancer that Is Baking Soda mixed with Molasses, I do Not have cancer that I know of but thought I might be good for getting rid of stomach fungus & pathogens I drink too much Listerine for this problem and wanted something safer, Of course want to use all Natural Ingredients with means Baking Soda without aluminum (aluminum Is poison) as Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda but when I seen the name Grandma's I thought It must be made by some big evil corporation that had some left over chemicals and thought If they dump a bunch of sugar In It then know one would know the difference so I ordered a different brand from Amazon but I seen Grandma's In WalMart and decided to use It until I got the other brand but It looks like Grandma's Is real natural molasses."
4,Great Product,"For the price this is truely a great product, works well for me. Needs the right antenna in order to work effective."
2,"Great selections, sadly, modified tracks for DJs","I purchased this CD hoping to finally get ""Amen, Brother"" on CD. However, the producer of this collection took it upon himself to modify most of the tracks to help DJs find and use the breaks. Sadly, this means that what you get is not quite the original recording. For instance, on ""Amen, Brother"" the track slows down just for the famous break and then speeds back up.Had these tracks been unedited, this collection would have been a 5-star affair. If you're a DJ looking for a great breaks collection this is it, just don't expect each track to sound right played straight through."
3,Could have been better...,"Only some, not all of the music in the game is on this. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I listened to it. The songs that WHERE on there sounded great, however, I'm rather sore and aggravated about that fact that I brought this sound track and still have to find other sources for the music.If you know other places to find the entire soundtrack (other then this CD) or know how to get it off this game, then get it from there. I'm very disappointed by the fact that all the music is not on there, and I don't think a second CD would have killed the manufactures.However, the 39 tracks of music that IS on here sounds great."
3,Could have been much better...,"Only some, not all of the music in the game is on this. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I listened to it.

I'm very disappointed by the fact that all the music is not on there, and I don't think a second CD would have killed the manufactures.However, the 32 tracks of music that IS on here sounds great."
4,This Book Cooks!,"I hardly know the French Chef from the Cajun Cook but I know good writing when I see it and Ellen has all the ingredients-wit,personality and the ability to tell a tale,to cook up a book good enough to eat! Even someone who boils hot dogs gets the urge to do some creative cooking after reading this book.Friends,family,food...three things everyone loves and everyone will love this book . This is a first rate writer cooking up a recipe for reading enjoyment. And I pretty much know something is good the first time I read it so I won't be changing my review tomorrow."
2,Cheap and Short,You get what you pay for. This key coil is of very low quality and has a rather short coil.
4,No batteries & a fun toy!,"My son loves watching the ball roll around this tower. I'm glad there is a toy he likes that doesn't require batteries. The only thing is that the tower seems to come apart easily (when my son picks the tower up from the top and tries to move it). It is easy enough to put back together, though."
4,splash guards,This item arrived on time and well packed. Installed easily and looks good on vehicle. Worth the price IMHO.
1,Wrong Item,It's either I received the wrong item or its listed wrong on Amazon. I clearly checked many times to see if it was compatible with my car and it says that it does but when I received the item it didn't fit. I am highly disappointed and will never purchase from this seller again.
3,Powerflow Pro-Fit Splash Guards,"The item I received was not what was pictured in the advertisement. The one pictured is what I was looking for. The item was still able to be placed on my car, but I was disappointed with the generic fit."
3,6402 front wheel mud flaps,These were soppose to be a custom fit for my 08 Impala. They didn't have the exact contour for the lower wheel house opening but I did manage to get them to fit after some careful trial & error measurements. Would probably not buy these brand again.
4,Mud Flaps,The mud flaps were a good price and look good on the car. There is not a lot of length to them so I'm a little concerned if they will hold up in the winter. You likely will have to drill holes since the flaps are not necessarily matching the screws of the car. Extra screws are included.
3,"It fits, but drilling is required","I had hoped that it would be a direct fit without drilling for the 2011 Impala, but that was not the case. However, once installed, the product works fine."
2,Not a really good fit,"I bought these because they were supposed to fit my car (Model 2 for a 2012 Ford Edge). They required a lot of trimming and fitting. I did save some money as compared to buying them from Ford, but I don't think the savings were worth the effort."
1,poor fit,"I bought this for my 1999 Mazda protege LX. It was hard to install because the material is stiff, and the product is not designed well enough to drape the contour of the fitting area properly, at least in my case. I would suggest going with a universal or the unmolded type."
2,"Too slow, too stiff... Get Arrau's earlier recording!","I am very disappointed with this recording. Like too much of Davis's recent recordings, it is excessively ""well-behaved."" Too slow, too little attention to the musical ""line""--to keeping the piece moving.To hear the great Claudio Arrau at his best, I strongly recommend his 1964 recording with Bernard Haitink conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra (on Philips, I think). I recently came across that, and it's spectacular."
5,Great for the Grand Kids,I purchased the tray to help keep things clean when the grand kids where around. They have been wonderful. We even use the trays for coloring time. It makes a great lap desk for the the kids.
2,A long but interesting list,"I'm puzzled by the many rave reviews for this book, which I enjoyed but found took effort to get through. The book reads like a list of stories about Robinson's life, told without the benefit of insight into the magician's psyche, and lacking much of a plot or theme to pull them into a continuous whole. At times the book seems to be a collection of loosely related encyclopedia entries. Moreover, the writing style is overly simple and lackluster, as if dumbed down. Fortunately, the stories are often interesting -- the tales of the Great Lafayette are entertaining."
5,A fascinating account of William Robinson and the world of magic at the turn of the century,"I've always been a fan of magic, and had heard of just about every magician in this book except for William Robinson. This amazing story touches on the lives of all the greats and gives you a peek into the world of turn of the century entertainment and magic. With detailed descriptions of the theaters, costumes, the magic tricks (even some of the secrets behind them) and the colorful personalities of the time, this book sets the stage for the amazing tale of William Robinson and his evolution into Chung Ling Soo. If you have any interest in magic, or just want to learn more about vaudeville and the rough and tumble world of live entertainment in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this book takes you on an amazing journey. Highly recommended."
5,"An Engaging, Magical Biography","A great story. A Chinese vaudeville magician, shot on stage by one of his own tricks; his colleagues are fooled; his associates are bewildered; his wife insists it must have been an accident. And then the truth begins to unwind. He's not Chinese. He has another family. And his magic tricks are just the beginnings of his deceptions.It sounds like an Agatha Christie mystery, or a Hitchcock film. But its actually a true story about one of the world's greatest magicians.I was a fan of Steinmeyer's previous book, which was an examination of how magicians accomplished their tricks and the weird personalities behind the scenes. And Glorious Deception is even more exciting, a look at the world of magic, with colorful, amazing descriptions. The true tale of Chung Ling Soo will be a real surprise to many readers, and I recommend it highly. I loved this book."
5,Jim Steinmeyer's Best,"After reading most of this author's books, magazine articles, and columns in magic periodicals, I've concluded this is his best. Combining history, behind the scenes theater magic performance, and colorful character profiles of famous magicians that took part in this interesting and engaging story, Steinmeyer draws the reader into a compelling plot that is stranger than fiction. If you liked David Bamberg's (Fu Manchu) book ""Illusion Show"", you will love this book, as it surpasses that work by a mile. Would make a wonderful, powerful movie."
3,So so.Very Dissapointed,"A great concept that is poorly excuted.This thing,the light does not stay on when plugged in.It is too small and loose for a normal ciggaret lighter,like my 2012 Honda CRV.Too bad.Hope they fix that issue."
4,Dash Glow Light is Bright,"This cigarette plug light is a nice simple light. LED bulb should last a long time. Provides a bright light in your car interior - probably too bright, so it may be too distracting while driving (in a car). BUT I bought it for my RV Camper Van to use in an auxillary plug in the back of the camper to provide a light in the back without turning on the larger ceiling lights. For that purpose it is great."
4,Aramaic Targum of Hebrew Bible,"This work is great. I have used it for many years in my study of the Hebrew bible. It is a great book for understanding how the Aramaic translators understood the meaning of the Hebrew back in their day. Note this book is in Aramaic - no English, so if you do not understand Aramaic this book will be of no use to you. It is too bad Anthony Ianosel did not know what he was commenting on. Note - the Psalms are missing."
5,"hot, hot, hot",a great mix of the most popular caribean party songs that go back to the days of our fathers and grandmothers some remixed with upbeat and current tempo.
4,Loved the video,"I absoutley loved return to mayberry vhs, I loved the quality of the vhs and everything... I used to watch the Andy Griffth Show all the time."
1,mets,I never got this VHS tape the seller never sent me the tape. I got my money back from amazon.co. I was very mad but they took care of things for me.
3,not the best recording it could have been,"Someone else mentioned the 'live' aspect of the recording; it's annoying to hear whistles and whoops to the distraction from Reeve's amazing voice.Plus, a couple of the songs aren't even 2 minutes long!I suppose it's worth about $5, but it could have been so much better."
3,It'll have to go...,"...to the,""hardly ever listen to"",section of my music collection. When the CD arrived I coudn't wait to put it on but was quickly disappointed to find this is a ""Live"" recording and not the,Chet Atkins produced original versions I had wanted to hear. Nowhere on the disk does it indicate it is a live recording. If that doesn't bother you then buy it and enjoy Jim Reeves'wonderful voice singing some great songs. If you're longing to hear the originals, like I was, pick something else."
1,NOT 12,This is for One not TWELVE erasers...what a rip. I bought them for my students and I don't think 12 five year olds will be able to share this
2,"Barely erases, falls apart, smells bad.","This eraser is designed to not harm thinner papers when erasing. Yet it still does. It also barely erases, crumbles to bits, and smells really bad."
1,Smudges and decomposes!,"I had no clue how this Artgum eraser worked until I purchased it at Office Max two years ago. I had been using mostly quality Pink Pearl Erasers made by Sanford for school, when I decided to use the Artgum for my all purpose activities. During the very short time that I used this eraser, I noticed that it left messy smudges on my homework pages and worksheets. It also began to ""decompose"", leaving nasty residue on the paper and on the floor! By the end of week, while struggling to get it to work, the eraser was almost entirely gone. I never bought that brand again, and to this day only use the high quality Sanford pink erasers.I advise you not to waste your money on such a low quality product and always stick with the Sanford, Enre, or Paper Mate erasers. Happy shopping."
1,Didn't survive,My puppy started tearing off the tread pieces 5 minutes after giving it to him. Had high hopes for this one...
1,NOT A HEAVY DUTY CHEW TOY!,"I only read the main page of reviews. Clearly that was a mistake. Perhaps the positive and older reviews were based on a previous version of this tire that was much tougher. Either that or their dogs are not much of chewers! Bought as a birthday present along with other bones and toys for my 1yr old pit bull boy. I have 2 other pits, 2 yrs and 3 yrs old, they didnt even get a chance to much more than smell the toy before he had most of the tire tread ripped off and holes in it and black rubber shreds everywhere. 2 throws playing fetch less than 5 minutes ago and the next throw is into the garbage can. The kong extreme toy and ball, the black ones, have both lasted over a year with all 3 dogs playing with them.KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Large, BlackandKONG Extreme Ball, Dog Toy, Medium/Large"
1,Destroyed in 2 minutes.,"Not strong at all and DEFINITELY NOT for heavy chewers. My German Shepherd puppy (4 months old) had this ripped to shreds in mere moments. The ""treads"" peel right off after a few bites. This was the Large size for ""dogs over 40 lbs."" My pup is about 20 pounds."
1,not very strong,Took approximately 5 minutes for our lab to chew all of the tread off. I would not recommend this for a large dog that likes to chew!
3,Put Good Tracks Where They Deserve!,The tracks are indeed very amazing in their 12-inch glory.The tracks could have been printed in good quality discs and not CD-R. Information in the inlay are lacking. The manufacturer stated is Awesome but it seems that it's still Hot Productions that's just slightly labeled and repackaged. Is it that maybe they just belong to the same group?Good tracks deserve excellent materials!
4,Interesting period book,I liked the characters and settingEasy to read and fairly engagingEntering words so I can submit this note
3,"Comfortable, but one size does not fit all","These are nice, flexible driving mocs. I have a small FIAT POP and the pedals are a bit difficult for my regular shoes. The driving shoes give me much better control of the pedals. But one size does not fit all. I wear a 10 1/2 EE so I had to buy an 11. After a while, my toes get sore because they are still too narrow. Hopefully, the leather is soft enough that they will expand to fit my feet."
3,"Good Book, average Twist","I will categorize this book in two sections - the GOOD and the BADThe GOOD: The book has an excellent plot. The first few chapter really drew me in. I enjoyed where the book was heading and for a short period i couldn't put it down. The character development was decent.The BAD: The book took a turn for the worst. It had so much potential but failed when it became more about the Lust factor. Without ruining the book, i will say that with a differnt twist this book could have been GREAT! With the existing twist it turned out ok.Overall, it was a decent book. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it but i wouldn't prevent anyone from reading it either. 3 out of 5 stars aint bad, but i rarely rate a book lower than 4.....read into that whatever you want...."
3,Could have easily earned 5 stars,"I really thought I would enjoy ""Vigil"" because I love supernatural horror, and I love science-fiction. When they are mixed well, you get ""Relic"" by Preston and Child. ""Vigil"", however, falls short of satisfaction. It is well written, but ultimately comes to no definite conclusion or climax. It seems to just peeter-out at the end. I think the biggest failing of this novel is that the whole thing seems to be merely a set-up for a sequel, or maybe a series of books. I am fine with sequels if they are done well, but when each component book does not stand on its own, I feel cheated. Having said all that, I am fascinated enough with the premise of this book, and the writing is good enough, that I will undoutably read the inevitable sequel"
5,A Supernatural Da Vinci Code - A real find!,"If you like intelligent books about the supernatural then put Vigil at the top of your summer reading list. In addition to a well-researched fact-based plot, it features a host of interesting and involving characters -- a rarity in this genre. An NYU paleontologist, plagued by his own private demons, encounters a fact-based mystery involving the Dead Sea scrolls, a string of unsolved murders and an ancient angel with an evil and erotic agenda. This fresh exciting work unfolds in ways I never would have imagined. Horror definitely has a new name -- and it is Robert Masello."
2,Not what I expected,"From the reviews I read on this book and the book cover, I was expecting a good monster/dinosaur gone wild in present day story. I was sorely disappointed. Instead of Jurassic Park I ended up with Rosemary's Baby! The characters were not compelling and the villian lacked a true purpose other than to he an fallen angel Zippo lighter! If you want a heaven/hell story, I suppose this is for you. If you see the cover and expect dinosaur fossils and DNA experiements, skip it!"
3,An attempt to blend myth & science that just doesn't work,"I do give this three stars because it kept me reading. But I can not agree that it deserves comparison to THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN. This one presents an interesting premise but doesn't produce chills. This was Masello's first novel and he has since sharpened his story telling skills. One specific example portraying how this could have been more chilling is the incident of the ringin churchbells. We learn of this episode in a second-hand manner or at a distance reducing the projected effectiveness.The premise is sufficient to make this an okay read, but we don't have a new King or Koontz at this stage of the author's career."
2,pretty stinky,"man, the cat who wrote this started out ok, but when he got towards the end, it was like he didn't care. like he completely gave up and just filled it with junk. i just skimmed through the last chapters to get an idea of how it ended. i wouldn't recommend this. rread ""quietus"" instead. same basic story but the auther in that one put a little more care in their work"
3,Oh Why?,"Horror its not. Sci-fi not really. A great premise that has great promise starts to go somewhere and stops... only to be rushed in the end with literally thousands of unanswered questions. What happened?It had a great terror novel opening hook; a clever storyline mixing theology, mythology and plausible though unlikely palentology. When the story starts to move you can see the moments in which Masello is thinking as he writes ""I should tone it down before it offends somebody in the Vatican"" then he rehashes some dialogue from earlier in the book and some psuedo-mythology to support the possible existence of the creature that when it finally makes its appearance, quite frankly, is about a horrifying as Zul was in the movie Ghostbusters.Is it worth full paperback price... well someone needs to buy it so people can buy it used or donate it it to the library."
3,"Mini-Review: Good concept, disappointing execution","There have been some interesting, purportedly non-fiction books about the book of Enoch, the Watchers, and so forth, all of which provide a terrific backdrop for a suspenseful horror novel. The author capitalized on the concept with a bifurcated story line that kept me turning pages for quite awhile. Sadly, however, he ran out of steam. The end of the book is predictable (and not in a good way) and an unsatisfying conclusion to a tale that began with such promise."
5,much better than expected,"i had never heard of robert masello and was reluctant to read it because i expected a stephen king like horror story with loads of blood, gore, splatter and other nasty details. i had promised myself that i would give the book to the goodwill immediately if it started to gross me out. instead i found a well written book with interesting characters. am not quite sure what character development is supposed to mean. why does a character have to change over the course of a book? isn't it enough if the character is well described and fleshed out and has believable emotions and actions? these characters had all that. it's one of those books that are really hard to put down and leave you disappointed when it's over because you want more. i will certainly look for more books by this author."
3,Easy read but flat finish,"After reading many of the other reviews on this book I agree with many who say that the book has a lot of potential and starts out very good but just falls flat at the end. You are introduced to some very interesting characters, brought into a good premise and idea but with about 100 pages left its like the author didnt know how to finish the book and just wrapped it up and sent it off to be published. One positive thing about the book is the way it was written it was a easy, quick read if that makes sense to you. I finished the book in just a few short sittings. If you can get this book at your local library or used book sale it might be worth your time but stay away from paying full price."
3,Interesting tale that failed to follow through,"""Vigil"" was an enjoyable read, right up until the final few chapters, when the tale unexpectedly degenerated in to more classic boogey-man action-kitsch or the sort that is all too common in this genre. In fact, the main problem with ""Vigil"" is that it manages to set up a pretty compelling mystery with lots of potential for strange science and weirder metaphysics, but towards the end it simply reverts back in to a clone of everything else out there. Masello is a good author, and I look forward to reading more of his work, but I got the nagging feeling that ""Vigil's"" conclusion was aimed squarely at the prospect of a sequel."
2,Undeveloped Potential ...,"First of all, kudos are in order - Robert Masello's ""Vigil"" enticed me based on the back cover and illustrations. I read it all the way through. Good job, Masello.That said, this story fell FLAT. It raised too many questions, offered even fewer answers and, frankly, the ending left a lot to be desired. Character development was also lacking, and a fair number of them get killed off before the reader ever really gets to ""know"" them. And if you're going to base a story on a mixture of angels, mythology and science, be kind enough to actually carry through on the premise instead of ending the story with a corny ""showdown"" of sorts in a barn.To sum things up, ""Vigil"" had potential. Unfortunately, it was never fully realized. My recommendation? Either check it out from your local library, or buy it used.M. Keck"
1,"Good Start , boring middle and end","The idea was great, however it was a struggle to finish. There is a blurb comparing it to the Exorcist and the Omen (why I bought it), please do not fall for it. It doesn't even come close to those books. Stay away! Get something by Tamara Thorne instead."
1,:(,"I can understand what the other (1st Reviewer) person's saying, but I agree - one must try out (work through the Sonship course) first before blasting it, commenting positive or negative. And I was raised ""Reformed"" but all that matters is JESUS anyway right?! His GRACE is all that Sonship is about:) It has changed my parents life and mine, and I recommend it to more churches (not just Reformed churches!)...My review:Ridiculous. One of the poorly written books by Jay E Adams. Disappointed he says his view is biblical, while all I see all over SONSHIP (by Miller) is all Scriptural (mostly focuses on Galations)! Didn't like, don't read it. Read & work through Sonship, and read the Bible! No one can ""follow"" or agree 100% with Adams, Miller, or anyone - focus on God's WORD!"
4,Rockport Piedmont Mens Casual Shoes,"OK shoes, nothing spectacular. Looks kind of old,you know for golf, not for everyday use. Comfortable,robust. I don't know if that is a good recommendation,as I got some very good deals on Amazon."
2,"These are original weber, but a poor design.","The plastic lumber is screwed to a powder coated metal frame at each end. The metal to plastic insures it traps moisture between the two surfaces which guarantees the metal will rust. You need to a) either remove these shelves and store them, after every use, where they never get wet, OR b) Buy them again and again as they become corroded and unsightly.IF Weber had made the frames of stainless steel, or even plastic the need to replace them regularly wouldn't exist. Powder Coating metal never seems to last long before the rust appears. On a BBQ subject to high temperatures, and exterior storage it is a sure thing. When you factor in a design to trap water against the metal it is a constant annoyance."
3,Buy TWO!,"Very deceptive is right. Even the illustration on the box shows one unit. Piece itself seems to be of very good quality, but such blatant misrepresentation is discouraging."
3,So so movie,"It's a typical boring romance movie. Unless you are the fan of the actor or the actress of this movie, you are not going to like it. I can picture some young preteen might enjoy this one though. I think the price of this DVD is a bit high. Better rent than buying this dvd."
2,Not worth it!,"Very hard to use, it got all over my fingers, I couldn't get it out of the container, I thought it would more like putty but it was almost rock solid. I even tried microwaving it slightly but even that didn't soften it up! I would not recommend this product at all! It also did not stay in place once I managed to get enough out to use."
3,Unsure,"Bought for my husband, still waiting for him to pick it up! I thumbed through, looks like it could be worthwhile info in those pages...what a bummer!"
4,Great Book,Entertaining & informative. I highly recommend to any husband out there who wants to make his wife very very happy.God Bless
4,the talk of the dorm,"I live in a co-ed dorm and all the girls were talking about this book. One of them even had a She Comes First tank-top which was really hot. I didn't know what all the fuss was about until I sneaked a peak at some of the illustrations. I am now a convert, with my very own copy. I learned how to use my tongue to do things I never dreamed possible, and I now know the divine pleasure of truly satisfying a woman without worrying about her faking it. I am grateful for this book, and so is my girlfriend. it's too bad that so many guys are too cocky to learn or to admit that they even have something to learn, but if you can check your ego at the door and read the techniques section, you will really learn. No hype, just pleasure, and written in a way that is fun and encouraging. But i do wish there were more illustrations because of the more expert level techniques are hard to visualize."
5,Every considerate guys secret weapon...,If you want to know how to reach legendary status with oral skills (and who doesn't?) you NEED this book.End of story.
2,no hair left,"Mr. Kerner tells us several times what he's going to tell us and then more than halfway through the book, he tells, but... in excruciating detail. What he says is exactly correct, but wading through the specifics is enough to make ME pull my hair out and throw the book across the room and I'm a thinking ""SHE"". I can't imagine a 'thinking man' trying to follow these directions without getting frustrated and giving up before the ""20 minutes"" are up. And I can't blame him. Mr. Kerner heavily referenced Elements of Style, but I think he forgot who his audience was."
5,It's About Time!,"Finally a coming of age book for men so that they can no longer say they don't understand women. A great read. Well written and clear, concise explanations. Will women remain a mystery to you after this? Read it and find out!"
2,"OK, but not as expected","Based on the title of this book and illustrations on the cover, I expected something that would cover a broad range of techniques, A to Z. This book covers primarily one specific technique. On that it delivers but overall, I'm disappointed. Read a page or two of the book before buying to make sure this is for you."
5,"If you love your woman, you need this book","I thought I was pretty good at this. But after reading this book I learned a lot more about the female anatomy and her psychology. And it's made an incredible difference. I was dating three women at the time and they all went wild and absolutely were astounded at how much better our time in bed was. I was literally having to fight them off as they were begging me to pleasure them. And the best part about that was, seeing how much they loved it made me enjoy doing it for them. It's been a gift for all of us. Seriously, read this book and not only will you become better at pleasing your woman but she will likely be even more motivated to please you. It's a total win-win."
5,Oh ladies buy the set!!!! You won't be let down.,This is a great set of books. He is a great author I have now bought everyone he's wrote. After 14 years of marraige I was sure we had done it all omg I was wrong talk about pleasure after he read this. lol go for it you will not waste your money.
4,Great info - fun to read!,"As a sex educator, this is one of my favorite books to recommend to men who want to learn to please their girlfriends or wives. It's chock full of info on pleasing women through oral sex. It also has good information about learning about women's genitals, becoming comfortable and accepting of whatever women do with their pubic hair and more. Definitely a good read (and short!)."
4,Very informative,"When I received this book my friend looked at me and laughed, said that I needed a book to teach me how to do that? I looked at him and shook my head, I told him that I was confident in my abilities enough to look into improving them. I said that poking fun at me for trying to enhance already good techniques is like going to NASA only knowing algebra and trying to project the course of a comet. Needless to say he didn't like that to much:-). The book is informative, well written, and easily put into practice. My girlfriend and I are always looking to any excuse to be in bed with each other and this book along with others just gives us another good reason to be there. The counterpart to this book is worth having as well if you are a woman."
3,Remedial studies at best,"Most of the chapters are about 2 pages max. And no offense, but I could not care less what Aristotle has to say. The first half of the book is extremely repititive and does not really provide any useful information, unless your a man who clearly does not undertand that women want you to pay attention to them and express some indication that you want to perform oral sex.For every page of useful information, there is about ten pages where you want to respond, ""Seriously? Who is that clueless?"""
5,very helpful,"Book is very helpful,teaches you how to be real smooth around the ladies.It teaches you how to treat the ladies like queens"
1,not every woman enjoys oral sex,This book is nothing but a one trick pony's guide to nowhere real. Not every woman enjoys being slobbered on. Buy yourself a good book on tantric sex and learn to bond with your woman instead. Sometimes sexual problems come from men stumbling around like the 13 year old boys that they never outgrew but it is still 90% in the brain. Learn to love all of your partner and make love to her heart and soul if you want to really satisfy her. Grow up instead of playing the adolescent Peter Pan. It is not a game or race to see who gets to climax but an orchestration of two people coming together in one space.
1,Ideas from a 13 year old,"I dont see why this was ranked so high. My expectation I guess was this would be more technical instead I found my self skipping past stuff and skimming finding my self thinking this is like an 20 year old writting this. There is no class.I wouldnt say it was a total waste however I would give it any high value, this one will collect dust on the shelf forsure.Considering selling my copy back however why would I burden anyone else with this?Can you tell how bad it was?"
2,Transformers,Did you know this book had a cameo appearance in one of the Transformers movies! Dark of the moon to be exact!
1,don't believe the hype,"If it seems like many of the reviews here sound like marketing copy or written by the author himself, they probably are. I was concerned when I noticed that these reviews simply repeated the book's jacket and text, and like the book itself, they are full of hype and hot air. Nothing new to learn here, no adventurous tips or tricks. Just a lot of empty rhetoric, missed information and oversimplification of a woman's sexuality. The ""dumbing-down"" for a male auduence makes it particularly tough to swallow."
4,She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman,"Ian Kerner walks you through how to give great oral sex to a woman. His main focus is not just the moves but also the change in thought that one must undergo. He discusses how you should truly enjoy being able to pleasure your mate, and how your effort shall truly be rewarded. The writing is rather dry and at times feels like a textbook; however, it is quite informational. Includes a great deal of background information on sex from a woman's point of view."
4,Who knew?,"That a woman's clitoris has 18 parts? I guess it's true what the author says that most men know more about what's under the hood of a car than under the hood of a citoris. I thought I knew my way around down there, but now I can tell you the difference between and freunulum and a fourchette without blinking an eye. I guess I was sexually ""ill-cliterate,"" but now I'm CLITERATE. I know more about my girlfiriend's clitoris than she she does now, which i guess is the way it should be. Only down-side is that that the techniques mainly focus on the tongue with only about ten pages or so on intercourse. But the author admits up front that's millions of books out there on standard sex, but little to nothing on real tongue-techniques."
4,A good read for women,It get to the point and is very informative. A must for women yo read and practice if they want a more exciting life. I'm a male!!
4,excelent,"excelent book, a book that every man should read!!!this book talks about the things most peoples don`t talk with their partners,about pleasing not you but your love one."
1,Disappointed!,"This book is obviously for men who do not understand the role of oral play / cunnilingus with women. I thought the book was about advanced oral techniques.. This is far from the case... This book did not introduce me to anything new, and I am very disappointed.Warning: If you are a man that is currently very active with cunnilingus, and is looking for improved techniques to bring your female lover to orgasm with cunnilingus (or other methods) this book is not for you.."
5,Finally a book for guys.,"Just wanted to say, I am thoroughly enjoying this and right now two of my best friends want it after i'm done."
3,Title is not quite what the pages contain,"Nice picture on the front jacket.This is really a guide to cunnilinguis hidden inside some fancy quotations and other stuff. Much more than necessary to get the point accross. The good part is that the anatomy is correct and it works, but I didn't need a bunch of added drivel and sentimentality added on the top. You don't really need this book. Just look at how many are for sale used to get a sense of how many people want to keep it after reading once."
3,Pretty Good Book!,"This was a good book but you definitely have to put your personal touch on it. It has very good information and if applied correctly, it can be very beneficial."
2,Overkill!,"Well the book was good in the respect that it did cover all the potential ways to orally satisy a woman....boy did it! What I mean is that the book just went on and on and on! The book could have EASILY been one third in length. Most ""chapters"" are only 1-2 pages long and the same material was stated over and over again. He covered it well but could have been a much quicker and easier read."
4,A good book that will make you convinced to let your woman come first,"Here is a book that has all the package - not so explicit but has the sensuality; Concise and very informative; Short but very believable. Afterall, Ian Kerner has a very good point in telling us that it is important that a woman achieves an orgasm during sex, in one way or the other. In this case, the author is good in convincing that the woman must achieve an orgasm first. I grabbed on this good book after readingAdult Pranks: Little naughty moves to turn her onwhere good naughty pranks are inside. Over-all, I'd recommend this book, not only for people who just wants to have a good time in bed, but also for people who wants to have lasting relationships."
2,Pass by the audio version,Hey Guys bought the audio version big mistake this is a read only or at least have the book to go back and look at.. the Author should stick to writing the books and leave the audio to the professionals. The book reeks of lesbian feminism sorry man haters this stuff will never replace sex no matter how much you want it to.
1,Do it your way don't read books,This isn't the book that you should pay for. This book is full of references to other books and doesn't really guide you to the point.
2,Men need a 240 page book on how to make a woman cum. Women just need 1 picture to teach about men.,"Seriously - if you need to read 240 pages to learn how to do something is it really worth the effort? If I'm going to dedicate 240 pages to a book I could spend it on MBA level finance book and learn how to make money, which would make my woman at least FAKE an orgasm (which works for me.)Women, simplify your vaginas. Make it work without making us read long books on a useless topic."
3,Good guide to oral sex,"The author does a great job of explaining the importance of placing a woman's pleasure before ones own. He also gives great advice on oral and manual stimulation. However, he completely dismisses the g-spot as well as female ejaculation, which is unfortunate in that it reduces his credibility as an expert on female sexuality. Lisa Douglass' book does a much better job of addressing that aspect of female sexuality."
3,Good information but....,"The information in this book concerning the female anatomy, the way a woman climaxes, etc Is very well presented and explained.Also, the information dispelling rumors and myths about cunnilingus is also well done.However, the section on techniques is a bit over done for my taste. It would be all too easy for someone performing cunnilingus after reading this book to focus too hard on remembering the techniques and thereby not paying attention to her body language and responses.I would have preferred it if he had given just a few basic techniques and put more emphasis on how to get your partner to give you feedback and how to better pay attention to her physical responses and act accordingly."
3,Good but not as good as the author thinks,"Two of the book's main premises are the importance of rebalancing women's sexual power (men are still far too focused on their own sexual pleasure) and the key role cunnilingus plays in a woman's overall sexual experience. The author has done his homework and I found the book very helpful. The only drawback, in my view, is the author's inflated opinion of his work. I have read plenty on the subject and see this book as one in a series of many which are helpful. However, the author continually reminds us that his work is unique, definitive and is the best in its category. I don't agree, but I am pleased with the writing nonetheless."
2,Good theory but not worth the money,"Mr. Rzempoluck covers neural network theory quite well, but be aware that the software is very poor! There seems to be little correlation between the book and software, leading to endless frustration. In my humble opinion, you would be better off purchasing one of the other Neural Network tutors out there. They cover the same ground and don't seem to have the obtuse approach that this text sometimes takes."
1,Not a very good!,"The explanations in the book and the software are very poor.The software has many bugs that prevent it from be a useful tool. It is very, very, very clear the author did not check his work to make sure the software and the descriptions in the book matched. I tried several of the examples in the book (starting from the very first one) and found several key points that were at variance with the description in the text. Moreover, the text itself is incomplete to poor in general. I see what must be several editing errors (ie. cases where cut and paste were used but never taken out when new text was inserted).I tried contacting the author via email to ask questions --- not available.The good news is, I bought the book very, very, very cheap!If you can find it for day ... at a book sale, it might be worth it to play around with, otherwise, forget it! Maybe it was dirt cheap because it is so bad."
4,Useful book,"I found this book to present a straightforward look into the complex world of neural networks. It is ideal for someone with little or no background in the subject yet covers sophisticated techniques as well. There were plenty of diagrams and many practical examples of how to use neural networks in the ""real world."" The software presents some challenges, however, given it predates Windows 98 and 2000. It seems to only work with US regional settings. Nevertheless, I was able to get it up and running and enjoyed the several examples and exercises described in the book. Overall, nicely written, an excellent introduction to the subject, and a good value."
3,A nice devotional but doubles as a promotional tool,"I recently purchased Who I Am in Christ. I am only seven chapters in but something is already very clear. Though the book in general is a sweet devotional, Neil T. Anderson does not miss an opportunity to plug his other works including his ""life changing"" Conference, and his books- ""The Steps to Freedom,"" and ""Victory over Darkness."" Every chapter a reference is made to one or the other and at the end of each devotional I'm left feeling that unless I invest in one of his other works I'm missing out. A clever marketing strategy; but for me- a real turn off and distraction when trying to focus on my relationship with God."
1,Lacking Depth,"The scripture refrences are great in this book, but the actual book is lacking a great deal of substance. The first few chapters were incredibly shallow. Towards the middle of the book he makes some good points, but none are thought provoking. I found myself getting frustrated with his lack of fore thought in his examples and was offended by some flippant remarks. Please, if you are wanting to do a Bible study, study the Bible and write down your own thoughts or discuss them with a group. Don't rely on what others say, your perception is just as valid!"
4,Still reading,So far so good..I'm about a quarter of the way through and its really been eye opening. I'm please with the purchase.
3,It works but make sure you,"OK it works but I had a few problems getting it to work. First the MPEG encoder would not install on Vista, so Vista's Media Center would not work. The software provided did work but had not product key on the CD and the company wanted emails of the packing slip etc to get one (a real pain). The antenna provided was worthless but I picked up a cheap one of Amazon and it works. Make sure you have a recent graphic card because anything low end or more than 2 years old won't keep up with the Bandwidth of HDTV.Make sure you have a big hard drive because this thing chews up 10GB a hour. (The card would not work with Myth TV either but for $[...] I can complain). I'm watching HDTV on my computer."
4,Learning and Great Information with Passion,"If you have ever cared to learn about the PR world and the subtle reamlms of advertising, pick up this book. An informational rollercoaster of pop culture secrets, this whirlwind begins and ends on the same high notes. Whether you are a publicist, someone trying to get into show biz, or just someone who wants to learn about what you watch on television, A Branded World will take you to the depths of how people make money off of what you see. An intelligent and insightful book, this changed my view of how things are marketed and made me want to learn more about the truths between all the channels and pages."
5,Marketing 101,"Though the audience at first glance seems like advertisers and company moguls, consumers will appreciate this insightful look at how to make your product stand out in a crowded diverse market place. Author Michael Levine contends that the product whether it is a consumable, durable, or even the consumer selling themselves can become more recognizable than competitors among the buying public through proper public relations.Mr. Levine includes strong examples of the winners and losers in the branding process. He also follows a fictional campaign selling a new brand of ice cream so that readers with background of years of marketing to a consumer who only knows commercial jingles will appreciate this insightful look at building the reputation of a product. With this primer, Michael Levine should become the branded name in PR creations.Harriet Klausner"
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"The majority of this book reads more like speculation by the author rather than solid fact. The impression this gives the reader is the the author has not dealt with many big brand names on a publicity level. The problem with this is that dealing with smaller entities is quite a far cry from dealing with a major brand such as Nike or Toyota.I kept reading hoping for some interesting inside scoops into the world of big name brands, but was let down. If you are new to the world of branding you might gain a few nuggets of information from this, but I found it all to be common sense."
5,"Yes , they are real !!","I read this book for the first time 20 years ago and it remains without doubt, the best i have ever read. I remember finding it a bit slow to begin with, but once you are drawn into the fantastic story line and the enthralling characters, you are hooked. It will leave a lasting impression on you long after you have read the last page. Perhaps being familar with Africa, its people and politics helps you to relate that much better. I will always recommend this book as ""The Best"""
5,Therapeutic Cozy Mitts,I purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself. The person for whom I purchased them is very happy with them and so am I. I was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because I have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour. It is too soon to tell but I hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands.
2,Mitts are scented.,"Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat. I used them once and then packed them away because I do not like the odor. I wish the mitts had been unscented. Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them."
2,Therapeutic Cozy Mittens,The mittens were a disappointment for two reasons: the thumbs are not heated and the sack which becomes hot in the microwave tends to slide when wearing the mittens.
4,Really good introduction to database concepts and theory,"Can be a bit wordy at times, but only because the subject matter is complex. Mostly, though, the book presents database concepts and theory in a concise, understandable manner."
2,Difficult to understand,If you are looking for a book to teach you SQL or Oracle I would recommend Oracle8i The Complete Reference or PL/SQL 101. These books go through Oracle and SQL step-by-step so you can clearly understand the examples. Michael Mannino's books combines tables without showing examples of the tables so it is difficult to understand. I would not recommend this book to any beginner.
2,CUT- UP,"Very good cycle. Barenboim does a fine job here especially with the 2nd and the 9th. The major problem with this box set is that the 3rd, 5th and 6th symphonies are Cut-Up between discs. Search for another set. There are lots out there for just a few more dollars."
1,basically pornography,"My 2nd grader reads at a very advanced level and she and her grandmother picked this up one day at the library -- thank goodness most of the first few pages went right over her head before we took a closer look at the content. We passed this book around at a dinner party and it had all the adults blushing. Read the firt 20-25 pages first before deciding what age-appropriateness. The excerpts from the Arabian Nights details graphic, sexual scenes that may be ok for some readers, but I don't believe it belongs in the hands of even middle schoolers unless accompanied by a very frank discussion with a responsible adult. This was listed on our 5th grade summer reading list, but I don't think that I know many 10 or 11 year olds that should be reading about having their breasts described as lovely fruits and their virginity lost."
4,A good book,"Alice the brave is a good book. It's about how Alice overcomes her fear of deep water. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is becuase Lester really sort of saves the day! Besides that, it's a really good book."
5,This is an awesome book!,Alice the Brave is a great book. It is in the summer and they like to go to Mark's pool alot. Though Alice is afraid of going in deep water she always comes anyway just to hang out. One she was sitting in a chair and they picked her up and tried to throw her in the water. She runs home in tears and embarassment.
4,Very nice shampoo,"This is a very nice shampoo, especially in the winter when hair is just nothing short of being crunchy. But, this stuff did have a tendency to make my hair flat, even as horrifically dry as mine normally is most of the time. I used it along with a regular shampoo to rinse out the residue which worked perfectly. It smells great too!"
3,More than I expected (where 'more' is not necessarily good),"I bought this map because I will be touring around Thailand for two weeks. The map is titled 'Thailand' but upon receiving it I was immediately dissapointed to see that it was really a map of most of Southeast Asia. The map covers all of Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, southern China, northern Malaysia, parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Thailand is right in the middle and only takes up about 10% of the map area. This map is huge, so the detail is decent but it is cumbersome to unfold/fold. The only Thailand city that is detailed is Bangkok. If you are travelling all over in Southeast Asia, this map would be useful. However, if you are only intrested in Thailand, pick something else."
1,WARNING!!! DOES NOT FIT,"This filter is NOT a true Black and Decker filter. In addition, it is bigger than the standard B & D filter, so the Dustbuster's small door for the filter will not shut. Not as advertised!!!"
4,Hard to find this thing.,Got a old hand vac with old filter you can only wash those things so many times exactly zero times as their made of paper. Thankfully I found this one on Amazon. You find anything on AMAZON!! Just make sure you found the right model number for your hand vac!!
4,One of Foster's better stories.,"It had humor, colorful characters and a fairly exciting plot. I found it very entertaining."
5,"Hysterical! And maybe even a little ""profound"" <grin>","About 6 or so years ago, my brother read this book, and loved it. And lately, I have been in a reading slump (don't ya hate that?) and he recommended me to read this one. So, recently I found it again at a used book store. (I had no idea it was still available, I thought it was out of print.) And I have to tell you. You can't go wrong with this one. It was fun reading, with never a dull moment. Just your basic old fashioned page turner. But it isn't exactly brain candy either, in fact, the book offers some interesting concepts on our vast universe. And the ending line will leave you with a laugh (it did for me anyway) So big brother was right. The book was great. You are in for a real treat! I highly recommend this one to all.Happy Reading!"
3,"I liked the book, with the single glaring exception of...","...all three human characters. They do not grow. They remain petty, impudent little pests and I found myself wondering why the other races tolerated the human species if this was all the better that they were going to meet!Seriously, the actual sci-fi was top-notch. There were a multitude of worlds and species that were well-done. But, it was marred by the inclusion of a punk rocker, a geek and a ditzy blond who continued to bicker, and sometimes actually fistfight with one another, no matter the situation. I wish he'd haven given that aspect of the story a rest."
5,Escapist!,Fantasy romance is an underserved genre-- this one is really worth catching. An usual romance with a darkly romantic plot. A page-turner.
4,Warm and comfortable,"This jacket is incredibly warm when used as a top layer. Although bulky to store in luggage, it's warmth far outweighs this problem. I purchased this jacket for an expedition to Antarctica."
4,The most extensive video collection of Donna,This truly a MUST for any Donna Summer fan. That stated will let you in on something THIS collection is the same as ENDLESS SUMMER available but hard to find both in VHS and DVD. So look ENDLESS SUMMER up...sometimes available at DVD rental sites/stores.Happy Hunting
4,Sound effort,Good rock cd. Good vocals and easy to sing along with. Favourite song is nightlight. Good background cd.
3,"Convenient size, lacks power","This massager is a good size, it doesn't take up much room at approx. 4"" long and 1.5"" wide. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the amount of power that it provided. The vibrating massage just doesn't have a big kick. I would rate this as a 5 on a scale of 10. Additionally the battery is an odd type. 1.5V, looks like a camera battery...not sure how available this battery type is."
3,"for REM collectors, not for casual fans","This single is decent, but like the reviewer before me, I would have to agree that live tracks (especially ones taken directly from Roadmovie) are borderline as far as paying hard earned money for them. They are very good live tracks, however. The 808 state remix of King of Comedy is sort of a comedy itself. Its redeeming features lies in the fact that it is a good reflector of New Adventures (although this originally was a Monster track). If you're like me, you will ponder long and hard if it's worth getting this single, and then finally you will realize that you should just go ahead and buy it so you don't have to live with doubt."
4,Another Good Story,"I say ""another"" because there have been many stories written about the people's adventures on and with Mt. Everest. Ken Kamler's story is a good one. I felt closer to his experiences with the challenges faced on Everest than other high-mountain climbers. The reason for this feeling was his description of facing realities and not making it to the top. I was tired of reading other author's stories and their successes. One could come away from reading several of these books thinking that Everest was something a lot of us could do. This is not reality. However, Kamler does persevere and does succeed and I applaud his focus and determination."
3,The Disaster Told from the Doctor's Side!,"First, I have already read Krakauer's book on the 1996 expedition to Mount Everest which is well-written and explained. I found this book to be dragging along and that bothered me. The pictures are in color and excellent and the black and white photograph pointing out important spots climbing Mount Everest such as the camps was a bit blurred in my opinion to get the grasp of the climb's enormous energy, courage, and bravery that many sought to accomplish even if it meant death at the top altitudes. While I'll probably never climb Mount Everest, I admire those who do because the toll that takes upon a human body is incredible as Krakauer points out."
5,A book that Pummeled me.,A great book. one of the best Everest books ever and I have red all of them!
4,Reccomended,"Ken Kamler is a likeable person and caring physician. His narrative allows you to feel the physical pain and frustration of high altitude climbing. From my armchair, I was rooting for him every step of the way. Although a competent climber, he's no superstar. Climbing is not as easy for him as it seems to be for Krakauer and therein lies much of the book's appeal.From the title, I was expecting more of a focus more on high altitude medicine per se, but it's really a personal adventure story.Definitely worth reading for a different perspective on Everest. Although not specifically about the events of 1996, it does cover them and it's a good follow up if you've already read one of the other books."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Broke in less than 1 week. I only paid $ .54 so I can't complain. Remember if it seems to good to be true... it is. If you buy this product, I would suggest placing a standard weekly order."
2,Lousy craftsmanship,"While it serves the purpose, if you wear it on your belt, it will inevitably be snagged or caught when entering or exiting vehicles or when you're carrying a bag over your shoulder. It will disintegrate quickly. Until a sturdier model comes out, I'd recommend an alternative."
2,Motorola Razor holster,"You gotta take the phone out of the holster to use it. Otherwise, it will force the holster off the phone when you open up the phone."
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Clip,It's OK - good for those who like to have the screen face inside and protect the face of the phone. Only draw back is that the top clip/snap oftentimes causes it to fall as it sticks out/up.
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Ratcheting Swivel Holster,"My Holster works fine. The key is that the phone goes in the holster face in towards the person. If you try to put it in face out, it will fall out. Maybe that is why the previous reviewer was having problems."
3,Not the right size,"Ordered this for a Motorola RAZR v3 and it's supposed to fit - but it was just too short to clip over the top of the phone. Luckily, I was able to remove the belt clip parts and use them to repair my other RAZR holder so it turned out well in the end."
1,Both broke in less than 7 days,"I ordered two. One arrived shattered in the package, the belt clip broke during the first 7 days on the other. They are made from some type of inferior plastic that is not at all like the versions that were available when the RAZR was new. These are a cheap imitation made from low-strength brittle plastic not polycarbonate as before."
4,Great Teaching Resource,The entire Naturescope series is a very useful tool for classrooms. Students seem to really enjoy the activities and they are easy to use. Teachers will find this packed with ideas to help students learn. Every resource room should have these materials.
2,Save Your Money,"I suspect that this book was very good - once upon a time. And therein lies the problem. It appears that the authors have not adequately updated the book, or, simply did a very poor job with the minor updating they did attempt.The book does have pictures of almost every gun it identifies, which is not true of most other similar type books.If you have expectations that your reference book should be reliable and current, then save your money and buy ""Bluebook of Gun Values"" or a similar book from Amazon.com"
5,Grind & Brew Perfection,"Want a grind & brew coffee maker that gets it right? This is it. Conical Burr grinder, 200 degree brewing tempurature, 8 minute brew cycle. Adjustable grind corseness, adjustable strength. Use fresh roasted coffee (my favorite is Caffe Pronto Bronco Blend) & clean fresh water & you have a perfect cup of coffee. A little more expensive than other grind & brews, but you are getting quality - worth every penny."
2,Longevity and Repair Issues,"This machine works great when it works, however it strains to expel the used coffee grounds and eventually fails. You get a non-helpful ""Error #8"" message and have to unplug/plugin the machine to reset and try again.Contact Customer Service when you have plenty of time to be on hold. You will be told to use a coarser grind setting. If that doesn't work (as if limiting the capabilities of the machine is a solution), you have to send the machine in for a $250 repair. It doesn't matter what's wrong with the machine, it's $250 for all repairs.I'm online now looking for a replacement with more reliability. I see some machines touting a removeable brewing unit specifically for cleaning and maintaining the machine."
3,Great machine!! Bad Customer Service.,"I have had this machine for over 3 years and it makes great coffee, espresso and such. It has issues with grounds, the ground built up easily on the inside and you have to reach inside and rub the grounds off the parts inside the machine. This is what customer service told me the 1st time I called about an issue, it worked, but if you know there is a problem fix it in future machines. I called about a error 8 message and I was out of warranty and was given the stock send it in and for 250.00 we'll repair it. I found if I get the grounds out from the insides the error 8 goes away, the ground gum up the moving parts inside. You think if your spending good money on a machine the company would want to keep you customers and make amends. They have a stock answer, no apologizes or even we'll give you a trade in credit to buy a newer better built machine. Next machine will not be a capresso for this reason alone. Again Great machine bad follow up by company"
1,Ill-designed machine!,"My husband did some research and bought this grinder/coffee maker for me for Mother's Day. I love nice, strong coffee, but this machine is ill-designed. We tried it for two weeks straight and had nothing but problems. The coffee grounds would not travel all the way down into the basket for brewing and there is no control for coffee strength. My husband called the manufacturer about this and was told to decrease the water amount for stronger coffee! You've got to be kidding! Also, the carafe barely kept the coffee warm after an hour. We returned it and bought a Cuisinart Grind & Brew (with Burr grinder) for about half the price of this machine. The Cuisinart has been a dream!!! Don't waste your money with this machine."
3,Different,Looking to find horror movies I have not watched before. Not quite what I thought but was okay in its own way.
5,This 90s CD is a must!!!,"For anyone that loves 90s dance music, this double CD is a MUST!!! Has songs like; Rhythm is a dancer, I've got the power, Connected, Pump up the jam and other great songs that were probably one hit wonders!"
3,Relational aggression,"RA is a really important subject to teach girls about. This source is definitely needed and I commend Dellasega for putting it out there. It offered some good strategies for people who lack the ability of putting together a creative program. I was dissapointed that the strategies didn't incorporate more art techniques (vs. crafts). For $30 I expected much more depth and professional appearance...this looks like something I could've put together at my office job. It lost a lot of credibility with me as soon as I pulled it out of its package. But overall, good concept."
4,Good Lord! it's loud!!,"I bought the phone for my dad who is hard of hearing and has memory loss. Phone was easy to program, putting the names and numbers on the list all he has to do is push a button.trying it out,I called my cousin and at the loudest setting and I had to keep the earpiece at least 2 inches from my ear. Even then, I felt is was hurting my ear! My dad loves the phone and better yet I don't have to yell into the phone anymore."
4,Does the job,"Performs as advertised. It would be nice if it also had a display window where it could display caller ID, and a call log--features we have come to expect on modern phones. But that is a minor point. What is important is that the phone can speak to me loud enough for me to hear."
3,Should Have Purchased New,"While there are many things I like about the phone; it did not come with instructions, so not sure if I am getting full benefit of the product. I checked the price from the manufacturer after I made the purchase, and while I did save some by buying used I should have purchased new since there was not enough difference in price. Oh well, live and learn."
5,Great phone for those who aren't quite hearing aide ready,"Purchased this phone for an elderly lady (84) who wasn't hearing well on incoming phone calls and the problem is miraculously solved. The tone and volume sliders are easy to use and most helpful for adjusting to fit the circumstances, i.e., background noise, etc. The ringer is quite loud on medium and loud and the red light is a plus along with the ringer volume to get your attention. Have had phone for almost a year without any incidents. All-in-all a great purchase. Highly recommend. Amazon's pricing and shipping charges (super saver) are a great plus when shopping."
1,Clarity breaks down easily,"I bought this unit and another similar phone (both from Clarity) for my mom. Both broke down within 6 months. There is no amplied effect now (the sound is actually weaker than a normal phone now). The ""push down"" bottons which is supposed to amplify sound also no longer work. I bought two other brands at the same time which are still working."
4,Perfect for my elderly mother,"I purchased this phone for my mother who is nearly blind and very hard of hearing. The buttons are big enough she can see them and the amplified sound allows her to have phone conversations, something we had pretty much given up. My only complaint is that the button you push to amplify the sound is not large also but the phone was designed for the hearing-impaired, not the sight-impaired as well. I looked everywhere to find something like this, and I'm very pleased with it."
5,"Superb! ...Move over, Lonely Planet!","Wow! Just got back from Venice, where we used this guide to find our pensione, restaurants (NO tourist ones), gelato, churches, the best tartuffi (chocolate truffles) in the world, and of course museums, attractions, and scuolas.We never found anything to disagree with on their reviews, although they called our pensione ""cheerless"" despite the sunny south exposures that were a delight.Best of all, the maps are cross-referenced to the text, so when reader looks up a restaurant review, the map location is noted and easily found (other guide books are infuriatingly lax in this simple and useful method).Absolutely perfect!"
3,A mixed bag... wait for the new edition?,"Just got back from a trip to Venice, and between us and our travelling companions we must have had 6 different books. This Rough Guide ended up being the book I carried with me when touring historical sites, as it had the most detailed descriptions and the best background information. The section at the end on Venice's history was fascinating. But the book is definitely getting dated -- many prices are still listed in Lire, and many of the hours of the various sights around town were incorrect. We also found the restaurant reviews a bit off from reality. Rick Steves' book was a much better reference for these things, particularly on restaurants which were all wonderful."
4,Lou Hoover - Who Knew?,"This book gives the history of a woman who doesn't show up in too many history books, which is a shame. While the book could go more in depth, it presents Lou Hoover as an accomplished woman who made many contributions to Americans, most notably the Girl Scouts. She is presented as the anti-Elinor Roosevelt - not in a derogatory way, just a different approach to problems and a different political ideology. In the book Lou Hoover comes across as a devoted wife, an educated woman, and a world traveler. While I would have liked greater levels of detail, the book made me aware of the contributions of a woman whom I had barely heard mentioned. The author has taken an admirable step towards giving Lou Hoover the recognition in American history that she deserves."
1,WARNING-STAY AWAY FROM RCA-LYRA JUKEBOX,RCA has chosen Thomson Inc. as their distributer.There return and/or replacement policy is excessively poor bordering ridiculous.The unit had a bad battery and I have been trying for 2 months to resolve this problem.WARNING if you have do deal with Thomson Inc. DO NOT BUY!!! Mitchell C. Cohen case#060-202-1017.
4,True Hi-NRG,"If you like Hi-NRG this CD is a good one to start. It has some favourite tracks and some songs, who were hits but not as succesfull than other tracks of the same singers. The Vol.1 of this collection is better, but this one still no failure! I also highly recommend the series Gay Classics Vol. 1-12. Great Hi-NRG."
1,Too bad,The title has only three songs that worth the acquisition: -Street Dance - Break Machine -Hold on to my love - Jimmy Ruffin -Sky High - Jigsaw The rest of the tracks is the same if are included or not in the CD: they are too bad.
2,Magnificent seizures,"I just downloaded this CD through itunes and it appears that the chorus is plagued by seizures during the opening ""Magnificat"". Enunciation is not great and the words seem stuttered. The following arias are flat, but somewhat more bearable, but then comes the now feared chorus again and it seems time to hit the delete button. The ""quia fecit mihi magna"" sums it up, heavy with labored rhythm with no excitement, so its time to stop listening....I usually like Gardiner, but this is not a recording he should be proud of!"
5,A fine Bruckner 5th Symphony,"This exceptional performance is another worthy addition to Philips' new commemorative series. The Concertgebouw Orchestra's fine playing is comparable to the Dresden Staatskapelle's in Jochum's second traversal of Bruckner's 9 symphonies, not counting Symphony ""0"". Credit must be given to Jochum and Philips' engineers for their inspired choice of an early medieval German abbey as a recording studio. The warm acoustics sparkle in this reissue; the orchestra's playing - most notably the wind, string and brass sections - is quite clear and crisp. Although this may not supplant Jochum's other versions of Bruckner's 5th Symphony, it will be a splendid addition to anyone's CD collection."
2,I was bored stupid.........,I have 5 other versions that are light years better than this performance. Save your money.
1,a voice without any kind of emotion,Her voice is powerful but this woman has never been able to communicate any kind of emotion. Maybe it is due to her lack of feeling. B. Streisand or Céline Dion are much better! Don't give a single penny for this CD.
3,"Interesting story, difficult read","I found this book to be a difficult read. I know that others have mentioned that this book was well-written, but I disagree. The writing style was original and interesting, but not that well executed. The start of each chapter, I was thrown into a unknown place and had no idea what was going on. Eventually, more and more is revealed until I'm back with the story and getting interested. Then the chapter ends and I start all over.The storyline is very imaginative and interesting. It has a more psychological tone to it, although there is also action. I like that Jacen was able to withstand the brainwashing, re-examine his understanding of the force, and put his own spin on things. In the end, he surprises his captors and his mentor, laying the groundwork for some interesting stories later in the series."
4,The Jacen Solo Book,"Even though I generally don't like a book when it is based on one person, I think this book was well written. You must pay attention to everyword to fully grasp this book about a young jedi struggling with what he thinks is the light and the dark side and the games Verge plays. It sets the way for Jacen Solo being a very powerful jedi."
5,jedi philosophy,he does a really good job getting into the nitty gritty of the phillosophy of the jedi while challenging their current ways.
5,Excellent Reading,This book is good reading. It develops Jacen's character from a indecisive bleading heart to a man who is very sure in himself. I like the development between him and Vergere. It is one of the most dynamic and confusing since Jagged and Jaina and Luke and Yoda. I like the ending the best and how it plays into the problems that the Vong are suffering in the current book.
1,dull,While I personally like the author's other works I cannot say that I enjoyed his addition to the NJO. It was dull. The endless philosophical journey of Jacen in this book came about in a painfully slow story arc. His breakthroughs were just not interesting by the time he made them. I also found this sacrifice of a fellow Jedi to be not only inconsistent with his previous persona but implausible to say the least.You can probably take a pass on this book and not miss a thing.
3,Way overrated,"I don't get the people who review stuff on Amazaon. After Allston's 2 superior novels, Traitor was much ado about nothing. Yeah, Jacen stops overthinking long enough to actually DO something. And yeah, finding out Vergere's a Jedi Of The Old Republic who knew Anakin Skywalker was cool - if it had led to something like a history lesson for Luke on the old Jedi down the road (which it doesn't).There wasn't any breakthrough revelations about the Force so don't go in thinking there will be. The idea that there is no dark side & the Jedi himself is ultimately the one with the darkness in him is sort of true & sort of not. Yes, overrated this book is. Destiny's Way however...."
1,Preview was the best part,"This was by far the largest letdown of the New Jedi Order Series. If you want to read two hundred pages on Jacen's thought than this is the book for you, but you can skip this book and not miss much in the series. The preview to Destiny's Way was the best part of the book, in fact you can read that and not purchase the book."
1,somebody shoot me.,"in my opinion the only reason to read this book is so that you dont miss any thing in this series, it takes about 250 pages for this book to get exciting. another problem i have with this book is the fack that stover alway made made ganner look like a blubering fool. in the previous books he was only an insecure man."
1,WORST STAR WARS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"This is by far the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. I had to force myself to keep reading until the end. I was hoping to learn something about the force and why the Vong can't be felt in it. It didn't teach me anything. I stayed awake for hours at night trying to grasp the meaning of want Vergere was trying to teach Jacen but to no avail. It got better toward the middle and than at the end it went down hill again. I don't know, mabie I should re-read it if I can force myself to sit through it again. If Matthew Stover never writes another Star Wars novel again it is fine with me. I don't mind philosophy but this was way to much, and than all the answers where vague if he answered anything at all."
1,worst of the series,"I have read almost all of the books in the Star Wars universe, all the way up to NJO Traitor. This by far was the worst book in the Star Wars universe. There were so many questions answered with more questions that it actually gave me a headache. It was a very slow read and just not as exciteing as the other 12 books. I thought about not finishing the book but decided to finish so I don't get lost in the series. I just hope that the rest of the books do not go down this road."
3,Ganer the Giant,"This review focuses in ganer although I came late to the series I caught up fast but still. Have not read Destinys Way.The book had a gloomy personality to it and really should have focused some on Leia and Luke. But abave all I am a huge fan of Ganer and near the end af the book at his last stand was a heroic thing to do.but I hated as a fan of Ganer. But the part with Verges Vsion and the line ""None Shall Pass"" engraved in stone was cool so that I why I give tis book three Stars. but it is a real cool book.I am not realy 12 I am 13"
4,A new point of view,The first thing I want to say about this book is that it was really nice to see an objective look at the Force. One of the previous editorals said that this author knew nothing about the SW universe and that his understanding was based on the role playing games. Well the Force is very intensively looked at in this book and its role in the Jedi's life. I like the take the Vegere puts on this and totally turns upside down what everyone has always believed in the Force. I think everyone takes it for granted that Yoda was the end all know all of the Force. Now we see there was others that had knowledge and wisdoms that even Yoda missed. Seeing others at Yoda's level from that time (hense the Anakin Skywalker comment) is really cool to bring the continuity thing to the forefront. Overall this a great book about a young Jedi (or not a Jedi) development and enlightenment into his place in the Force.
3,I love Star Wars,"Ok, so I am a Star Wars fan to the bone. I also LOVE the New Jedi Order series. This book however, while being a slow start, ended quite nicely. The first few chapters of the book made me want to skip ahead. Not much more then Stover waxing philosophical about several things that deal with both the Star Wars universe, and our own.After that though the book did pick up, getting more to the Star Wars action I know and love. Stover still threw in his philosophy throughout the book, but it added a nice touch to it.Being a huge fan of the Jedi in particular (my favorite part of the Star Wars universe), the best part of the book to me was Ganner Rhysodes battle with the Vong warriors. It brings to mind Anakin Skywalkers death scene in Star by Star.Overall I rate this book a three. While it had it's great action moments, and while philosophy is NEVER a bad thing, too much of it can bog the book down and make it boring. Other then that, a great read."
5,this book series is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i loved this book alot my all time favorite charecter is featured in the new jedi order book series his name is jacen solo one seriously awesome charecter this book series is amazing from the very begining to the very end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Jacen Solo's self discovery journey,"Jacen Solo's a wonderful character, and this book goes deep deep deep into his head. As a prisoner of war, Jacen's already been taught much about pain, but his controversial teacher has much much more she wants him to learn.Matthew Stover's very good at painting a picture of someone's battle wounded psyche."
5,"Weird, but definitely worth a read","This has been the most unusual book in the entire series. At times, I had to remind myself that it was Star Wars, but it was an incredibly interesting book. The philosophical discussions were rather controversial, but this book is definitely worth a read..."
5,A good read,"If you are looking for a book that concentrates on one character; this may be the one you are looking for. Of course it would help if you knew the plot of this series, however, I started halfway through and so I really didn't care as long as it was good!I read this in two days and I went back for more; this tore Jacen's character down and then built it back up again. I can see links from this book to the Swarm series in realistic cerntanty that Jacen hadn't gotten away from this situation as cleanly as I had first hoped."
1,"$90 for a ""Don't smoke pot or you'll end up in the gutter video?""","And only 24 minutes at that. The people who produced this film must have been high.There is little difference between the wild assertions made in this video and other classic anti-marijuana films like ""Reefer Madness.""Like this -- ""once they've started abusing this drug, individuals begin a downward spiral."" That paints all marijuana users with a very broad brush, to say the least.To be sure, this film is ""blunt"" but there are few actual facts presented and a lot of anecdotal ""evidence"" to support the claims made. Children should not use marijuana or any other illegal drugs, but when you grossly overstate the dangers of illegal drugs, you undermine the goal of dissuading people from using them."
1,buyer be aware,"I haven't seen this DVD because I can't afford it. But I can say that there is a huge amount of free material from the center for disease control, including a video on the myths about marijuana, and all sorts of drug education videos, for FREE. I would never spend this amount of money when comparable products are available at no cost."
1,"Crappy movie, waste of my time",yeah the emperor wears no cloths is not pro pot or anti pot. This movie was made by a group of people who are afraid of a plant. i know this for a fact. Also marijuana is not a gateway drug. It can be used by people who are going to use harder drugs already because of there emotional state and MOVE past weed because it is not strong enough for them.
2,Aerosol is nothing like the liquid form of this product.,"I bought this aerosol form of Finish LIne bike lube by accident--I was looking for a big bottle of the regular liquid lube, saw ""8-ounce"" and bought it online. I was surprised when the aerosol arrived, but figured it would still be a good product. It is okay, but nothing like the regular lube, which I think is an awesome product. When this aerosol runs out, I definitely will buy the regular lube again, and be more careful when I order!"
2,Gunked up my chain like crazy,"This lube gunks up like crazy on my MTB. Doesn't seem to matter whether I'm riding in wet or dry conditions it attracts ALOT of dirt. Maybe I'm using too much but even after a tune-up at the bike shop, where they applied this same lube, the gunk collected in a few rides."
2,Attracts dirt,"This product does a good job keeping your chain lubricated, but if you're looking to keep your chain clean, I do not recommend this lubricant. I clean my chain after every trail ride and I can't seem to keep it from collecting more and more dirt. I'll probably switch over to the Dry Lubricant by Finish Line once this bottle runs out.Engineered in USAManufactured in Canada"
4,Works Well,Works well and easy to apply. No complaints. The bottle is decent size and should last a few seasons of applying if done 2-3 times a year.
5,Bicycle chain lube,"Excellent product. I would recommend everyone use this product. I've used this product on 12 bicycles at the VA Center in Tomah, WI. All bicycle chains and derailers work great after using this product."
5,This lube sticks!,"I used it to lube up an old chain that I degreased and it sticks nicely to the chain. It does pick up some dirt while riding around in the dry, but I can't say whether or not it is any more than you would get with a dry lube."
4,Works well but messy,"Appears to work well, however, it stays wet and is a bit messy if you are using your bike to commute as you will get black stains from the lube on your pants. In addition, you will need to reapply after heavy rain. I am considering going back to using a drier lube like Boshield."
4,Slick and sticky,"I've tried this on a couple of rides and found it to be a very effective chain lubricant. It's viscous, sticky, and keeps the chain moving smoothly. The downside is that it is messy and difficult to clean up. It will transfer to your clothes and it will deposit chunks of goo on your sprockets."
1,Empty package...no book,"I received a ripped package without any contents. It was a textbook that I needed right away, and paid for fast shipping. I am now in my sixth week of school and have yet to receive a refund or my textbook. I am so upset and frustrated. I am a struggling college student with four kids, and don't have more money to purchase the book again. I have an empty package to show for fifty five dollars...so not cool."
4,"Excellent quality, service & price","This book arrived in even better condition than claimed, on time and is well worth the price. Thank you for the excellent service."
3,Mud Flaps,"I purchased these flaps and installed them on my truck over a year ago. Installing them was a little difficult because the self tapping screws that came with it were a little short for my truck since I have a fender lip on my F150. Once I got past that they went on fine and looked great. Just the right size for the F150, you might want a bigger set for a 250 or above. I've noticed over time that the flaps have developed a slight curl due to the wind resistance, I do a lot of highway driving to and from work. But the flaps have worked great to protect my truck from road debris and grime. I no longer have to scrub off the tar from the lower half of the body after driving through new blacktop."
5,Had an issue,"Its not a big deal, but just make sure that you read whether or not these will work for your vehicle. I looked up my trucks make and model through amazon and then splash guards... then was sad to find out that these actually wouldn't work for me. They seemed pretty solid though, so Ill leave a good review."
2,Does not swim,"We could not get the doll to swim in the pool, the mermaid tail does not move it enough to propel it. It does float and is a big doll with just to play with but it does not move like it says."
1,plant dead,"plant arrived dead dead,dead.dead.dead, dead,dead, very dead, not green beadrownish and limp. not happy with this plant dead dead d"
4,Nice plant and handy to have around.,"wanted one of these for along time so i bought this and a few others.all came as advertised in good health and size for the price, cant beat that!should fill in just fine in a few months with some TLC and a new pot. A+ impulse buy!packed well fast shipping."
1,BAD,"IT WAS A PLANT YOU HAD TO PLANT YOURSELF A BABY PLANT THAT WAS IN MY MAILBOX AND FELL APART WHEN I OPEN IT TO PLANT IT, IT WAS A WASTE I SHOULD GET AN CREDIT FOR THIS BAD PRODUCT AND THE PICTURE YOU SHOW IS NOT THE PLANT YOU GET ."
1,Aloe Vera - Medicine Plant - Burn Plant - Miracle Plant,"Aloe Vera - Medicine Plant - Burn Plant - Miracle Plant - Healthy nice plants, growing well in my plant window"
3,good product poor shipping,I read others reviews before purchasing this plant. The reviews I had read were good and said that the plant was packaged well for shipping. That was not my experience however. The plant arrived in a box upside down with all the soil spilled out looking like it had been through a tornado. I would be willing to believe that the plant was in good condition when it left but it arrived in a less than desirable state.
2,"Small, Dead Leaves, WASTE","The picture on this item is deceiving, and so are the reviews! The main reviews showing are from 2009/2010. When you go to write a bad review, they ask you to contact the seller instead, so that you don't write a bad rewview. I do not think this was worth the price when you include the shipping. It is so small, the BOX (with shipping bags inside) fit in my miniture APT. mailbox. The plant was half dead when it arrived. The ends of the leaves were all dried out, and had a whole dead leaf as well. There were only FOUR leaves. What a waste!"
5,Aloe Vera cures everything!,I ordered this plant because of the wonderful tings that Aloe Vera does and was pleasantly surprised to open the box and see a plant in perfect shape. This wa my first time ordering a live plant by mail. I year later..the plant is HUGE. I use it for everything!
3,Aloe vera struggling... very unexpected,"I bought this along with a dragon fruit cactus plant. Both came in the same box. Packaging was very plain so there was obvious damage to both plants. The aloe vera plan was damaged along 4 out of the 6 shoots and the 4 shoots have been drying out and dying. I think with better packaging the aloe vera would be much more lively. Overall, I think the plant is good, but because it was poorly packaged and damaged in shipping I'm giving it a 3 star."
2,ehhhh.,"i expected a big chunk of aloe plant, but it was an actual plant. it had soil and was very small. there were only about 2 or 3 aloe leaves on there and it is growing very slowly."
2,Dissapointing,"The aloe plant arrived on time but did not meet my expectations. It was smaller than i had thought it would be, only about 3 inches tall. It also was falling over. I'm not sure whether it had broken of or was never properly placed in soil, but the plant just flopped over and isn't even in the soil."
3,Good ideas but easily found on the internet for free,"I was hoping to get a book with some new romantic ideas that I haven't already seen. A few are pretty original, but the bulk of the book is fairly routine. I was actually disappointed because many of the ideas in this book can actually be found online for free....Not the best romance book I have come across."
1,I wanted to like this movie...,"But it SUCKED! OK, it started out really cool, a group of like 6 friends go on a cave exploring trip, it QUICKLY turned ugly. I think it turned ugly too quick. Bad news is, it STAYED ugly. The movie stunk. It went in circles and was just poorly done. The acting sucked and it was totally cheap. Stay away...unless you need something to get you fast asleep."
1,Some good kills and lots of shots of dirt,"The way this film is edited is the most frustrating part. You see, each shot in the film goes like this: Wide shot of the interior of a cave or closeup of dirt or skulls in dirt, caveman looking hillbilly enters the frame, walks through the frame, now hold on image of cave, dirt, or skulls in dirt for up to 8 seconds, cut and repeat! While there were some really great kills and exciting special effects in this flick.... I was so annoyed with everything else that I came to the conclusion it still was not worth it. The Hillbilly chicks were kinda hot."
3,I LUVED IT and where is MICHAEL BERRYMAN ?,"Cannibalism is not the subject of idle chit-chat. Really liked the effects, set and bad guys in this Theasylum flick. Tom(Bill)Nagel is the only victim ,I had apathy for...Being a fomer carpal tunnel patient, My hands hurt almost as much as Toms. Vaz(Callum) Andreas had the most scenes to emote in, If you could while munching on co-stars. Leigh(Sawney)Scott had the kewlest role as leader on stilts and why not when your also the director. Tom(Towart)Downey, Hey they didn't list you in IMDB& we interviewed before, Has the most fun as the Big Brother with a gimmick. Louis(Sherriff)Graham was even more disturbing then as the neighbor in When A Killer Calls, For shame on you sir. Erica(Rhian) Roby has the required T & A scene and is as pretty as she is hungry. The ending freaked me, And not in a good way...Whatever happened to happy endings &#61516;"
4,pleasant,"Not one I listen to that often but I do like this cd. The orchestral accompaniment really takes the music to another level. Some really good songs, some I pass over. On the whole I am glad I purchased this one."
2,Not so ultimate,"I haven't seen any other reviewers noting that the song ""World Without Love"" is mixed so badly as to have about 50% of the instrumental track obliterated. Not only are the vocals such that they overwhelm the instrumentation but guitar riffs and fills are barely audible. The rest of the CD does not seem to do this but . . . ultimate it's not."
3,Fatal Omission,"A good compilation as far as it goes, but where's ""Stranger with a Black Dove,"" my favorite P&G hit of the 1960s? Why was that left off??"
3,At Least Two Songs Missing,"Several of the reviews of this CD refer to two songs on it: ""Knight In Shining Armor"" and ""Jokers"". Yet the MP3 version of this album is missing these two songs. WHY? WHY? WHY?"
4,"The Ultimate, perhaps",This is a great CD that contains every charted hit and some B-sides from these artists. This one CD covers it all. Sound quality is superb. An excellent value purchase if you want to get a complete overview of Peter and Gordon.
3,Fresh Oldie Fan,"""Ultimate"" is the appropriate title, although not totally accurate. This CD has many or all of this duo's greatest hits, but don't expect the familiar radio versions - because they aren't there. The cuts are nevertheless pristine, but this is for diehard fans who love all P & G's work, regardless of source."
1,Don't hate it.,"One star is for ""I hate it"" but we don't hate it. Was hopeful that this would help with IBS, but NO. The search continues."
4,The moffat museum,the moffat museum is not as good as the first 3 but is still good. It's funny but sylvie is gone halfway through. But that leads to some great stories. It only follows jane and rufus though. Joey and sylvie's views are never shown. but i like the stories so it's worth 4 stars.
2,"Cute, but openings too small","I thought these would be a great way to display the kids' pictures through the years. Unfortunately the openings for the wallets is only 1.5 x 1.75. Our photo packages include 2x3 wallets as the smallest size and with that opening you can only get the head in (if lucky). The description claims the mat is suitable for 2x3 wallets, but cut out a 1.5 x 1.75 opening and check that it will give you a nice crop before you order this item."
5,Great Gift,I bought two of these School Days frames with mats for my kindergarten aged great nieces. They came promptly and were in excellent condition and high quality. I was very pleased both with the product and the service.
2,Not impressed!,I m huge fan of Carly's and really all of the American Idol season 7 contestants. I bought her CD (along with Brooke White's) because i thought it was going to be like the music she sang on the show and on tour but I was wrong. It's just bubblegum pop that doesn't fit her voice at all. Carly has beautiful range to her voice and it never showed in this CD. Pop music works for some but I expected more from this CD. The music compny screwed her in this cd. It should of showed her range more.
4,She's No Sanjaya,"But, she did a decent job on this album. Maybe her new gig will give her another opportunity with better promotion. Good luck, Carly."
4,An unfound gem,"I'm not really into this genre of music, however this cd works. I really liked Carly on AI and felt she was let go way too soon, but that's the voting methodology for AI. She has the vocal capability, she had well written and produced songs but the album didn't do well. There are quite a few radio hits that never made it to the masses and so this album ended up in the bargain rack. That's not the way Carly Hennessey's bio should read: very talented singer but wasn't marketed properly. She was 18 years old when she came out with this album and it's very good, anything she did today might be spectacular. Give this album a try I think you'll like it."
4,Brings back memories,Loved her back when this song came out but could never find her full album until recently. Great vocals. I also recommend her more recent band We Are The Fallen as well.
4,Great CD,This is a great CD and it's a shame it was overlooked 7 years ago. I loved Carly on AI and was sad to see her go. She is very talented and has such versaility with her voice. I can't wait for her to release another CD. She is a true talent.
4,"Review of ""Economics - An Integrated Approach""","This book is excellent for an introductory rendition of micro/macro-economics. It is easy to read and the work may be supplemented with outside lectures. Students can achieve a good understanding of the subject in a short period of time. This work could be updated to reflect the technological innovations of the internet etc. In addition, the work could contain an appendix referencing the area of mathematical economics. Lastly, the author should provide more notes on classical economists."
4,Powerful Stories of a Basotho woman,"This book is told from a Basotho woman's perspective. Its made up of a series of short stories about the author's life. The stories follow no chronological order because the author doesn't feel they need to. In Africa, there are many oral story tellers who pass on their stories to generation after generation. Think of this as a written version of this woman's family stories. Every story is unique and reveals a great deal about the culture of the Basotho people. If you are curious about the lives of African women, particularly the Basothos, I would recommend this book. This woman suffers through many hardships such as poverty, hunger, the death of many members of her family, and the horrible treatment her and her people receive from the South African police. However, she is strong and able to survive a lifetime of tough experiences. Truly a great read."
4,A great resource,"This is a great book to buy for 3rd year. It covers a lot of ground and includes something that I've wanted for a long time: book reviews by and for medical students. NOTE: while shopping for this title I read many reviews that suggested buying 101 Biggest Mistakes 3rd Year Medical Students Make and How to Avoid Them - don't buy that book! It's all common sense and a waste of money. This book plus Tarascon Publishing's ""How to be a truly excellent junior medical student"" are a much, much better combonation."
3,Review,It's Cute and fits snugged around my mom's mp3 player. She likes it so i guess it's good for the price!
4,Good protection for small items,"This case fits small devices, like digital voice recorders and possibly ipod nano. It provides holes for headphones, etc., but does not allow access to the screen or buttons."
3,Brides Of Blood,This movie was just OK. Quality of reproduction below average (original may have been ordinary). Plot and story line just OK.Promotional material misleading as the movie doesn't deliver what you may expect.Overall this was a just watchable event.
5,Crappy..and I love every minute!,"As an addict to MST3K for 20 years, goofy bad films and TV shows are delicious to me...this one in particular, brings back memories for me as a child. My mother and one of our neighbors decided to take me and a neighbor kid to the drive in in 1968. The bill was this film and another on the genre. Neither of the mom's did any homework on how gory it was and that it had nudity! I was 7 years old and saw my first boobs!I fell asleep in the station wagon at some point and when they got home after the show, they left me in the car-in the garage-not an attached garage! They didn't want to wake me up and just went in to bed themselves!!! I woke up around 4AM, and freaked out! The last image in my head before I fell asleep was the creature in this film! I finally got up enough nerve to bolt out of the car and ran like a Ugandan Olympian into the house...Mom had some challenges making good choices at times, but I love this film anyway!!!"
5,Amazing,"What a wonderful resource for alternative uses for everyday things. Chockful of ideas and humor! With everyone 'going green', a good resource for making your own cleaners and re-using things that usually end up in the trash."
3,"Book okay, but expectations were higher.","Delivery of product was excellent, but book itself was just okay. Don't know what else to say, but great on delivery of product, but the product wasn't anything much that I hadn't read before."
4,I would have never guessed,This book has a lot of useful tips on how to fix things around the home from gardening to laundry to craft ideas using items you already more then likely have. I say it is a must have in any book collection
4,Remember what I said about Ghostface before....4get it.,"If any of you read my review of Clue's album, note I said Ghostface was wack. I've changed my opinion and now I think he's one of the best in this game today."
3,Ghost,This is an average album. there are some decent songs and the production is okay. Probably for die hard ghost fans.rating C+
5,BULLETPROOF WALLETS!,"I`dont understand why so many people dislike this album. I think it`s better than ironman but not as good as the perfect supreme clientele. The best tracks are: Flowers, Theodore, The forrest, The juks, Walking through the darkness and The hilton. Make sure you listen to it about five times before you judge it."
2,"Ghost Face Killah's ""Bullet Proof Wallets""","Ghost has emerged as my favorite member of Wu Tang. However, it saddens me to report my disappointment with this latest project. I'm all for experimenting, but what's up with all this R&B (...)? That Carl Thomas song is wack and the best new product isn't even on the album. There's a hot song floating around with Ghost flowin over a Barry White track that's missing, and the album version of ""Flowers"" is weak compared to what I guess is a remix. Overall, the production is poor and although Ghost is always witty with his rhymes, I expected more. With little contributions from other Wu Tang members and Rae's subpar performance, this album will not be in rotation very long? Back to Ironman & Supreme Clientele!!"
3,A weak effort from a great MC,"I am a loyal Wu-Tang fan however I am greatly disapointed by this album, in that it is an obvious ploy to get on MTV. In a surprising change of events Ghostface Killah has implemented the services of Carl Thomas and even Ginuwine???(although the track got cut from the album). The track listing is also messed up and states that there is a track with Slick Rick that is nowhere to be found??? They also dumbed down there lyrics, where as before they used highly original word association, there raps are now dumbed down...recognise that...RAE and GHOST need to flex the next level word play they flexed on ""Ironman"" ""Cuban Linx"" ""Wu Tang Forever"" and ""Supreme Clientlele"", this album is a step back lyrically, and beat wise....Rae sounds awful on this album, his lyrics are so simple now. Listen to ""Nutmeg"" anything off Supreme Clientlele, the lyrics run circles around anything on BulletProof wallets...I am not a hater, this album is just weak...recognise"
5,Beginners guide!!!!,"wot can i say 'bout this album.well for a start when has Ghostface killah ever failed to bring out an album which hasn't amazed everyone(including the critics!)and this album is no exception. The beats are still raw and the lyrics are still out of this world, with a little bit of lighter 80's melody which adds a new and improved side to gfk's work. Songs like ""maxine"" and ""flowers""(with the usual wu members) opitimise the album, and with Raekwon onboard to add that true wu flava this album won't fail to live up to expectations yet again."
4,Bulletproof Album,"Ghostface Killah's worst album to date (Bulletproof Wallets) is still one of the best albums of 2001. Tracks to check for: Maxine, Never Be The Same Again, Theodore (an introduction to his new team, Theodore Unit, which once consisted of Superb, Tryfe, Baby Thad aka Twiz of American Cream Team fame, and Solomon Child. Superb is curently incarserated and Thad is out of the picture. Tryfe and Solomon have been joined by a few additional members), The Forest (excellent story telling by Ghost, using names of infamous cartoon characters), Strawberries (another excellent song featuring Killa Sin of KillArmy) and The Juks."
3,Great Album,"Not to be a down my man who wrote the ""biography"" of Wu, but Wu-Tang Forever came out early in 1997, not 98. It's only a year difference but it's important because after this is when Hip Hop came completely under Puffy's dominance with the death of Biggie. It is an essential year in Hip Hop. But Wu-Tang did not step back, the world did. However, many true admirers still followed their careers with the 98 release of ""Tical 2000"", Inspectah Deck's ""Uncontrolled Substance"", Wu affiliate Killah Priest's lyrically groundbreaking ""Heavy Mental"", Gza's 1999 ""Beneath the Surface"" and the infamous ""Supreme Clientele"". Immobilarity was just a little off, though it was ok. But there were plenty of ill Wu releases other than that."
1,This album is WEAK for Face,"What's the deal? Today his new Pretty Toney hit the stores, and I don't even know if I'm gonna get that cause Wallets was just plain JUNK. I mean honestly, how could you go from a classic like Supreme to Wallets? Not to diss on those of you who like this album, but hearing Ironman many a moon ago and then progressing, or should I say declining to this is just unacceptable for one of Wu's best lyricists. But, many of the other members of Wu have done the same. I hope to expect more from Ghost, but who knows. If you have ANY respect for the Wu, skip Wallets and bump Ironman or Supreme."
2,............Just because its Ghost,"The album is O.K/Weak. It will probably get sold back. This bullish was rushed, and it sounded like it. I love the smokin' weed interlude, and like 2 other songs. The rest of the album is straight-up booty.That's all I have to say, FO, REAL!!!!!!!!!!"
3,well...,"ok...this album is nothing compared to supreme clientele...don't expect ironman or cuban links either...whereas I wouldn't consider it ghost's best effort...it isn't highly disappointing like so many other 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) wu-tang efforts (i.e. every wu album after 36 chambers, raekwon's immobility, etc.)...half of the tracks that really gave this album promise before its release (goodtimes, flowers (original), the sun, the watch) didn't clear sample wise and truly detracted from what an album this could have been...overall, I would say give this album a good solid listen before buying...if you do not own supreme clientele, ironman, cuban links, liquid swords, tical, 36 chambers or even return to the 36 chambers, go buy them first and then come back and consider bulletproof wallets..."
2,A disappointment,"If you like Ghost's first two albums dont waste your time on this album, because it is nothing like the first two. It is all weakly produced R&B crossover songs. Plus Ghostface put on the terrible Superb on this album again, which doesnt help my overall feeling of it at all. It would be hard for me to pick out one song that I liked. This is a suprise from one of the most consistent mc's in the clan. What is happening to the Wu!?!"
2,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this album, but was let down for the most part. First of all what is Ghost thinking of when releasing an album where all the songs are in a different order and others are not even on the album? For example one of the best songs in a minute was left off but in the track listing it is listed as track #1 (the sun). That's just unacceptable.The production on the album is very mundane as heard from the first single. This song is shameful to the Wu Tang legacy. Does Ghost really think the average listner is going to pick up his album because his first single has Carl Thomas on it? There are not enough Rza beats, plain and simple. Furthermore, where are the Wu posse cuts? THe best song on Supreme Clientel was Wu banga 101 with the fellow Clan. On this album they are for the most part MIA. Even the potentially classic track the watch has a different beat on the album that cannot even touch the non album version. Overall a disappointing release."
1,JUNK,"The Wu Tang is old news. I heard on the upcoming wu album ghostface supports Bush!!......what a sellout!This album is just sloppy, it seems like it was made in 2 days.Probably one of the worst albums to come out this year."
5,good one,This is wonderful hand cream ..I have been using this since two years almost every day...it hydrates chapped hands and absorbs quickly ...
4,nice non-toxic,"I was looking for non-toxic cosmetic products besides good for dry skin. I swim and go through a lot of lotion as a result. So many nice lotions and hand creams unfortunately are high toxicity. I'll buy this one again, though its claim to last through hand washing is overstatement. I always read customer reviews on Amazon first, then check the winners on cosmetic safety database site before buying."
4,great for winter,"the top of my hands were getting soooo dry b/c of the cold weather so i started using this again and it saved my skin from looking like the Sahara desert. i like this lotion, b/c it doesn't feel greasy at all after you apply it."
1,It's used!,"The one I received is half empty, and it is not sealed! When I pushed the tube, some drops of liquid came off! Although the rest is fine, I feel very disgusted! It is definitely used! I will never purchase beauty and health product from amazon any more!"
2,Looks like it was used.,The one I received was only half full. And there was no seal inside the lid. I could not tell if someone else had already used it.
3,film cracks,"i don't know whether this is just me, after i put it on and apply it all over my hand, the film just crack and coming off directly. i have to go to the sink and scrub the film every time."
3,Waxy,"It is non-greasy and it moisturizes well. Having said that, the claim that it lasts through hand washings depends on what classifies as a hand washing to you. If you just rinse with water, it will last but if you lather up with soap it's gone. Have you ever made the mistake of trying to clean up a wax spill with a wet rag? It's really ineffective because the water doesn't penetrate the wax... that's how this behaves. It has a very different feel than any other lotion I've tried. I recommend trying it out in a store first and if you like it buy more online."
1,Used ?,"There was no seal on the hand cream tube and it seems like portion on the tube was used. Disappointing, will buy elsewhere."
5,great binoculars,"I'm so glad to have finally replaced my 30 year old pair with these to use for birding and other general uses. They're small and lightweight enough to carry for hours, and are a snap to quickly adjust. Mine are always out on my kitchen counter for quick closeups of birds at my feeders. I love them so much that I purchased a second set as a gift for relatives who attend frequent concerts. Highly recommended by me."
3,not as immediately accessible as his other CDs,"I wanted to love this CD but so far after a few listens, I only like it. I don't think it's fair to say that this album is worse than previous ones -- rather I think it's more complex and takes time to appreciate. There are some great songs, but even the best don't match up to his classics from earlier albums. So overall as an album this one may be better, but it lacks the incredibly catchy and memorable tracks from earlier ones. I have one small gripe -- can't Marc afford a more audiophile label? The sonics are mediocre to bad on this CD. Way too bright, way to pop in terms of recording -- I'd like to hear Marc's liquid voice with a tubed recording. He deserves it."
4,Abuelita Fanatica Desde NJ,"I have everything that Marc has done,including videos,movies,you name it.I wanted Libre to take my breath away like Otra Nota did the first time I heard it.I think That Libre is good but not great.The songs for the most part leave something to be desired,somethings missing.Marc should just sing &stop the cutsey stuff like giving shout outs in the middle of a beautiful musical riff.In my opinion Caminare is"" musica gorda"".I still love you Marc but I hope you get back to your raices[roots.]"
2,Como triste,"I was incredibly disappointed in this new cd......his passion must have gone out the window....I hope it was a one time thing....he is a phenomenal performer with a voice that has no competition....but if this is his new style then I might be forced to find another fave......I am very sorry I spent (...) on this cd......Marc, get it together ok?"
2,Disappointed,"I have almost all of Marc's previous CDs. I am a true Marc fan, but I was truly disappointed with what seemed to be a lack of energy on this CD. I played it for my family and they said the same thing. It was as if he was forcing out the lyrics. Sorry, save your money."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","I spent a good amount of time looking for a phone for my mother who is both hearing impaired and visually challenged. This unit seemed like the correct choice as it had easy to use memory speed dial buttons and good amplification specifications. This unit was purchased new from [...] through Amazon. When it arrived at my home I tested it out and was extremely disappointed. Horrible sound quality, noisy volume control, noisy handset cord, and when set to the loudest setting was hardly loud at all. Even the ringer volume wasn't great, but the flashing light worked well. In short it was a piece of garbage and was promptly returned."
1,BEWARE,"This WOULD HAVE been the perfect phone for my 89 year-old mother ... IF it had worked as described in the user manual. Since she lives in an assisted living facility, and she has to dial ""7"" to get an outside line, she needed a phone that would include a pause when programming the memory buttons. The user manual describes how to do it, but it wouldn't work. I even called Ameriphone's customer support, and they verified the phone was defective. I returned it to Amazon, and they shipped me a new one pronto! However, the replacement had EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM, so I'm not sure whether both phones were defective, or it just has a defective design. Amazon took the second one back too, and gave up on it, refunding my full purchase price including shipping. Amazon performed very well, but this phone did NOT! The only problem is I can't find anything out there made by another company that has the same great features. BUMMER!"
5,A MUST-HAVE resource for all who work with children!,"All Eyes Up Here, by Dr. Tee Carr, is a practical resource, full of useful ideas and positive information for principals, Sunday School teachers, youth leaders, and especially classroom teachers. Dr. Carr offers a slew of suggestions for creating, managing, and maintaining a positive environment for children. Dr. Carr sprinkles delightful stories and anecdotes from her own teaching and administrative experiences throughout the book making it a pleasure to read. This book will inspire and rejuvenate all who work with children."
5,A Sense of Project in Print,"Whereas my many other books on HTML coding, JavaScript, Web Design, etc. offer step by step approaches to tasks, this book offers an overview of what a quality Web Application project looks like. Rather than overwhelming the reader with unreferenced jargon, it provides confidence for those of us who view web literacy as an infinite learning curve."
3,Review,"This book is all about the big picture. We know the technology that drives any and every web app, other books are for that. This book does not deal with that - it deals with the structure and purpose of a testing the web app, by step by step approaches and tasks."
1,Draw lame Dinosaurs,If you are wanting to learn how to draw super LAME dinosaurs this book is for you. Even if the dinosaurs were cool (and they are not) the steps to get to the final drawing are awkward and not very helpful. I own about 30 how to draw books and this is by far the worst.
3,Where is the test?,"Everyone says it's i the appendix, but i don't see any of the questions in the appendix, just some forms, like the couples forms, relationship forms...am i missing something?"
3,Free questions to the MMPI-2!,"Despite the closely guarded nature of the MMPI's questions, they're all here--yes, all of them--in an appendix. What were they thinking? Anyway, this is the main reason to buy the book."
1,MMPI 2,"The book did not help at all. Even with the questions, the answers are so convoluted that making sense out of them was an exercise in fruitlity. From reading and srudying this book it is very apparent to me why the Psychiatric community can never come up a very clear and concise diagnosis of the unusual behavior of some people. It also VERY cleary shows why no one is ever ""cured"" of any kind of mental illness. A quote from another source: ""There is no such thing as mental illness. There is only dealing with life's issues."" (Szaz) I would think thay this is the best review. They don't know, and they double speak ."
4,Beautiful Tissot,"This is an attractive and interesting book, containing many of James Tissot's best paintings with detailed accounts of the year each was painted, the current location of the work, how it was recieved when first exhibited and the story behind it. It also has a very good introduction about his life and work. Highly recommended to any Tissot, costume or Victorian enthusiast."
5,ANOTHER SIDE-SPLITTING EPISODE FROM LUCYBALL AND CO.,"""L.A.at Last"" is a prime Lucy venture. This is the famous episode in which she sees William Holden at the Brown Derby. Later that day, Ricky brings Holden along to meet Lucy(she was reponsible for getting pie all over Holden at the famed restaurant earlier that day),Lucy attempts to disguise herself via a putty nose,glasses and a scarf over her flaming red hair.Legend say that the scene where Lucy douses her nose in her coffee cup was entirely her own doing (her nose was on fire)!The scene where Ethel cuts Lucy's spaghetti with her manicure scissors is a gem. ""The Fashion Show"" is very funny as well with amazingly realistic ""sunburn make-up"" applied to the star.Sheila MacRae appears as herself as do the wives of Van Heflin,Dean Martin and Forrest Tucker."
3,GREAT IDEA BUT LITTLE BANG FOR THE BUCK,"This is a great idea and design, the remote allows you to navigate through songs before changing channels. XM is awesome!!! The only negative of this product unfortunately is the sound that is pumped out of the speakers. The speakers output sound that sounds like a $25 dollar boombox rather than the $200 system it is. If you are using this as a stand alone boombox I do not think this is worth the money. I bought this system for my business office where I am constrained for space. So this system allows me XM radio and a CD player without taking up much space. I have a computer speaker system setup so the saving grace of this system is that it has a headphone jack so I plug my speakers into the headphone jack and I have stereo quality pumping XM/CD's all day !! Problem Solved !!!"
5,Great gift,I bought this for my chocoholic aunt as a birthday gift. It was much less expensive than the in-store price and she loved it.
5,Hershey's thank you's,I made my own thank you's for my daughter's Christening at a local print shop and needed the bars only. They are perfect for keep sake after.
3,nice tasty chocolate bar,I love them and my kids love them. We make them at home occasionally for a special treat and there is just no replacement for a chocolate bar. They are also great in the freezer. Just all around a good item to keep in your pantry!
3,Sent the wrong item,"Although the was packaged and sent in a timely manner, I was sent the wrong Item. I ordered the Hersheys Milk chocolate and was sent the Hersheys with Almonds."
1,Broken Candy Bars,Most of the candy bars received were broken. I am not sure if this was in transit or at the warehouse location but I was very disappointed.
3,Mediocre,"I purchased the candy bars from this vendor for my daughters party favors. Long story short, they arrived in a decent time, only thing is some were broken and some not. They should be shipped with some type of signage indicating the fragility of the contents. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to send them back and had to use them. I was content with the pricing but unsatisfied with the candy bars themselves. I don't think I'll be using this vendor again."
1,Wrong item. Terrible attention to detail.,"I ordered a box of plain milk chocolate. The large amount of chocolate was part of an elaborate gift. I was sent a box of milk chocolate WITH ALMONDS. I whole heatedly LOATHE almonds. The gift did not call for almonds and was ruined. Absolute waste of 36 bars of chocolate. I would be less offended if this was the first time I heard of this problem. After reading other reviews, I see this is a recurring problem. Sending me almonds was relative to a slap in the face, just as this was to the other purchaser. Do not order this chocolate. The warehouse staff working for this seller clearly does not care what you want."
5,For My Mom,I bought this for my mom as it is her favorite childhood book. It's a very cute story and a perfect introduction to chapter books for kids!
3,Odd Twists in an Adventure Story,"I purchased this video due to Adrian Paul's presence in the cast. Paul is one of my favorite actors and, in my opinion, one of the most attractive men on the screen today. This 1997 outing is definitely not for kids -- there is a great deal of violence. I won't give away plot points, but I did find some of the scenarios highly improbable. I would recommend this as a novelty to any fan of Adrian Paul, but that's about as far as it goes."
5,Your music,"I heard your music for the first time on station 112 Elements...your music is heavenly, just beautiful and soothing. The first song I heard was ""I Come To You"". I immediately searched for you on youtube, but could not find your music. I am in love with it, very soothing, very beautiful. Cheers!"
3,It could be true?,"I don't know if one love could be alive for more that nine years if no one see each other, keeping that apart, the story is almost good, I think is better Secret Thunder that is the first part of this book, but sincerely you don't need to read the first part to read and understand this book, but it helps.The story of Alexander and Nicolette is quite simple and whether is true or not, is the story of almost every book, it does not have something really interesting but it will keep you reading if you feel like reading a book, don't expect to much of it."
4,The Black Sheep Squadron,"A thorough and entertaining book about the famous Black Sheep Squadron by one who lived it. McClurg's reproduction of the actual combat reports and telling of actual missions gives a great insight to the most famous Marine Aviation Squadron of WWII, VMF 214, The Black Sheep Squadron."
2,Not for the layman,"This volume is a scholarly work and not intended for the layman. I was looking for a general history-type book, but you would probably need a degree in ancient history to get much out of this collection of essays. If you do have this type of education, it's probably a great book, but it was not meaningful to me."
1,Buy It From Amazon!,"I am very attached to my m515, and so when I wanted to upgrade I read all the reviews on Amazon. I chose the Tungsten T2 based on the reviews.In order to save a few bucks, I made the mistake of ordering my handheld from palmone.com instead of from Amazon. I received the box in the mail...but with NO HANDHELD IN THE BOX! I have been working with PalmOne for five days, and I still do not have a handheld. While they are polite when I call, I don't think they believe me. I may be out $250.Amazon is very reliable, but I have nothing good to say about the service from PalmOne. They can't even manage to get the handhelds into the boxes."
1,Loved it at first but keeps malfunctioning !!,I loved how fast this tungsten is and the great color screen ( so much better than the previous model) but the tungsten keeps crashing. Thank goodness I always back it up! I've owed palm handhelds for 4 years now and upgraded several times with newer models. Quality and dependability has really gone down. I'm returning this for another mnufacturers' handheld.
1,Worst Palm Handheld,"I am very experienced with technology and particularly Palm products (the Tungsten T is my third Palm handheld). The Tungsten T has a delicate cradle - I've replaced three cradles in nine months. Also, I have replaced two of the handhelds for reasons that were not explained to me.Technical support is nice, but I have yet to have a discussion with technical support that lasted less than 30 minutes!!!! This product has done the opposite of save me time. I am looking into purchasing another brand."
2,"Great, but out of date","I bought this item because, back in the day, I had an earlier model Palm and wanted to go back to it after a few years of good old paper appointment book. The unit itself is just as good and useful as I remember it. The problem I've encountered is that the desktop software is out of date-- it isn't compatible with the last 2 or 3 versions of Windows, so the only computer I've been able to sync it up with is a 10 year old laptop that a friend gave me (because she no longer uses it). It wasn't until after I bought it, unfortunately, that I saw it listed on Palm's website under devices they no longer support.I still love the PDA's, just make sure you get one that's a little newer and is sure to work on your computer."
1,Palm,Everything looks Ok except that I cannot use the botton corner of the screen to use or touch with the pilot because do not work .Seem that the screen must be replaced. How can I have my money back?
1,"Tungsten T2, simply disappointing","My Tungsten T2, which I purchased new, revealed its defects only following 4 months of active usage. A soft and hard reset, and a call to Palm support did nothing to resolve the problem. Anyways, here it goes: The unit incessantly moves, without prompting, between screens. For example, it'll move to Brown, Joe while I'm still looking at the details of Alfa, Romeo. I've resorted to using the find feature to access telephone numbers, which I'll jot down quickly enough because tapping for details simply repeat jumping between screens and contacts. This erratic behavior is not unique to the Address book application. It's the same in datebook, photos, etc. I've only used about 7mb of my 29.7M, so it can't be because of memory.Palm's 90 days warranty, which I find suspicious, meant I was already outside warranty before I realized the defects. This will definitely be my last Palm PDA."
1,Useless,"That's that. Useless. The lens gives cloudy images. The fittings are difficult to handle. The bag is over sized. The only good thing is the tripod. Which I still use. But you can buy tripods cheaper than this garbage can with which it comes. And oh if matters were not bad enough, the shipping of the company is worse than terrible"
5,Mac Intel,"I have a MacBook 2Gz Core 2 Duo. Getting the Drivestation to work on my Mac was easy :1- Ignore the Mac utility that comes on the CD, it doesn't work.2- Connect the drive to a Windows machine and install the windows setup application.3- When you install the application, a new window will appear with ""RAID Setup Utility"". For some reason, when I ran the utility from that window it would walk me through a number of setup pages, but never let me pick the configuration I wanted for my drive (RAID1). If that happens to you, run the RAID Setup Utility from Start/All Programs/BUFFALO/... instead. That opened up the window letting me pick my configuration. I picked RAID1 ...4- Connect the drive to your Mac (I chose Firewire), DONE. Works great ! It mounts every time, no issues.The drive itself looks good, well built, silent. I only wish the cord was a bit longer."
1,Raid Setup Utility does not work - tech support on hold for 40 minutes,"I should have read the review here before buying this product. I downloaded the latest Raid Utility for Windows and it still cannot find the drives. I disabled the drives as suggested on the BuffaloTech web site and still cannot find the drives.I've been on hold for 40 minutes for tech support. This is the second call. The first call, I spend 10 minutes on hold, and then got hung up. It seemed like the company rushed the product before testing and probably too cheap to hire tech support people to deal with all the problems.This is my last Buffalo Tech product."
3,USB Connection Does Not Work with Raid1,"I could not get the RAID utility to work on XP with USB either.But while browsing the documentation for the Mac, I have noticed something about using WireFire. I switched the cables and was able to set up a RAID mirror on Windoze XP. For the sake of completeness: I have also downloaded and installed the latest RAID Utility from buffalotech.com.It seems like people are running into this problem, but the information on the net and in the documentation on how to fix the issue is very sparse."
2,Good Technical Writing - Bad Examples,"Experience Design was exactly what its title says. The book is full of pictures that can be found on the Internet, talks about what the author believes is the right way and wrong way to do a web site and avoids using any graphical demonstration of techniques. The book is a novelette on design pictures. It is all reading and no walk-though examples. The print is small and hard to read because it is placed over busy backgrounds.While the color pages are beautiful, there is not CD provided for studying or trying out techniques. the $45.00 price tag is a bit steep. There are other books on the market that provide better help for a designer looking for how-tos and suggestion on what to use on the web sites they are creating."
1,Experience something else,"The book was as confused as it was loaded with visual eye candy. The most pressing need for visual experience designers is knowing when to make information speak for itself and live on its own. It doesn't need to be fancy or dressed up like a overdone light show at a rock concert. Please, more substance."
4,Breadth of Experiences,"Experience Design is a high-level view of how experiences are molded and shaped for those that interact with the constructed place. This book is not a how-to book, but a broad expanse of how things are constructed for interaction/experience. The high-level views that Shedroff provides offer starting points for understanding, not the endpoints for understanding. The book provides a jumping off point for experience design, by showing examples and briefly commenting, why the example is used. This seems like a picture book showing results of those that read and practice what is learned in ""Information Design"" (a collection of essays, ISBN 0-262-10069-X), among other other great resources found in the resources section of Shedroff's book."
5,"WOW!! What a ""Fantastico Concierto!!""","Too bad the composer, Albeniz died so young. This is absolutely beautiful...especially because the pianist, Enrique Perez de Guzman's impeccable performance is nothing less than thrilling. I'm so happy I found this!"
2,An interesting premise,"This was a rather underappreciated episode of the original series. The Enterprise comes in contact with a planet that is an exact repica of Earth and beam down to a deserted, probably Midwestern American town reminiscent of the 1960's. It is found that the only inhabitants are children who have aged very little in over a 300 year period and that all the adults were killed as a result of a medical expirement that failed. The idea behind this story is great, but the storyline is lacking in interest and the acting is mediocre. Plus the children are a total nuisance. Production design is interesting portraying a decaying town that has not changed in 3 centuries, but the model of Earth is too artificial and map-like."
3,Just so-so,This episode is mediocre. The annoying kids in it make it somewhat difficult to enjoy. Too many obnoxious kids in the episode.
1,Never Arrived,"The music get 5 stars, but the package never arrived. The vendor did refund the $ promptly. The shipment was lost in the mail."
1,Out of Balance,Installed two FM/Wagner BD60356 rear drums on my GM 3500 Dually. Rear vibration was so bad could not go above 50 mph. Removed all 4 rear tires and spun the rear axle/drum assembly on the truck to 65 mph with MAJOR static and dynamic movement. Had shop replace rear drums and it took three additional drums to get a pair of barely acceptable drums. One was actually 26 oz out of balance and was rejected out of the box. Had to spend a LOT of money to make these Chinese parts acceptable.Wagner has a problem in the manufacturing process.I have contacted FM/Wagner about this issue and requested reimbursement for double labor charge.More to follow as my request goes through proper channels.If I had it all to do again I would not accept a Chinese part and would go to GM for pre-balanced replacement parts.
1,Not as portable as I thought it was going to be,They missed telling me that I had to plug the hard drive in to ac power outlet. I was led to believe all I had to do was plug it it into my USB port and I was ready to go. Not as portable as I would like.
3,Nasty jokes rapped on a background of R&B.,"Listening to this Blowfly album is a lot like listening to old Redd Foxx and Dol-A-Mite records. It is raw and nasty to the bone. Not many artist can pull off an album with this mix of songs. May be too rough for delicate ears. Most would consider sexist, homophobic and mysoganist."
3,Lowgrade stuff that somehow works,"The production, lyrical content, and delivery are all of low-grade quality. Clarence ""Blowfly"" Reid sounds like a street corner drunk trying to amuse his friends with dirty lyrics (one can imagine the young 2 Live Crew getting inspired by this). But somehow, like the best records of this kind, it somehow works."
4,Gracie in action is a must have title for any BJJ enthusiast.,"Though by todays standards this film may seem very dated within the world of MMA and BJJ,it's heavy weighted history still carries a plethora of merit in todays world of combat.You will be delighted to archived footage of master Helio Gracie taking on Japanese masters in the arts of grappling.You will see Rorion Gracie and company dispatch strikers,wrestlers,and every other type of martial artist in-between.Though BJJ may not be the dominant force it once was,this film brillantly shows the impact and influence the Gracie family has had within the world of martial arts."
1,A waste of talent,"What a waste of talent. Having heard Nestor since the 70's, I cannot believe he has fallen into the instrumental hip-hop pop commercial smooth music, it is not even jazz. Nestor is one of the best flutists in latin music, be it latin jazz or salsa.If you want to listen to Nestor at his best, get ""Morning Ride"" or ""Dance Of The Phoenix"". Or listen to him as a sideman in the 70's Orquesta Novel albums, Batacumbele's ""Con Un Poco De Songo"" or in Cachao's Master Sessions Vol. 1 & 2.If you are into instrumental, hip-hop, pop, commercial, smooth music, this is an excellent album, but if you are a hardcore latin jazz or salsa fan don't waste your money."
3,Old School Cartoon,"Not the greatest movie in the world. I game it 3 out of 5 because watching the movie is almost like watching mulitple episodes of the show. It's like watching a clip episode. I think that kids of today would love this show, but I'd pick up a TV season of the show rather than this movie. That way the can experience the Cadillac cats too."
4,Clip show,"This 'movie' is basically a clip show put together to pretend it is a movie. It's okay, though. Keeps kids entertained for a couple of hours, so it does what it's supposed to."
5,im never eating again,"ok, so i just saw the movie. if ur into rock the soundtrack kicks butt....the movie on the other hand is disturbing. i suggest not eating before (or after for that matter)."
3,"Good music, but what does it have to do with House of Wax?","Right from the first track ""Spitfire"", I wondered what on Earth the song had to do with a house of wax, or with the movie at all. The only lines are ""If i was in world war II they'd call me spitfire' and 'cause you know that I can'. Only lyrics in the whole song. And they have nothing to do with the movie at all. The only song that I believe is fitting is ""I Never Told You What I Do For a Living"" by My Chemical Romance, which is pretty descriptive of the movie. The Joy Division looks like it was just stuck in there so people would look at the soundtrack and go ""Oh, wow, Joy Division -- I'll get it because they're on it""The rest of the bands, except for the Deftones, MCR, and JD of course, really don't possess much talent at all. Stutterfly sounds like a rip-off of Hawthorne Heights. The others are just weird wannabes.That's my review. Peace."
3,My Chemical Romance,"The song that they play at the end of the movie is called ""Helena""! too bad it is not on the soundtrack! : ("
1,What the.....,"How can you put a Joy Division song on a crappy movie? Not only that but on the same cd as that popular ""wanna be goth band"" Chemicale Romance?! Joy Division is often labeled as goth music (I am not goth myself), but it is an insult to the memory of Ian Curtis to have one of Joy Division's best songs on a crappy cd with other no talent bands. My only favorite band besides Joy Division would be the Deftones and Minerva is a nice track. So if for some odd reason you want to have this cd in your collection it would be because of these two tracks. I mean c'mon Chemical Romance??? Thats happy music compared to Joy Division."
3,A decent soundtrack for an okay movie,"I was quite surprised with this soundtrack. When you have a below average movie, you generally expect a below average soundtrack. I mean, I only watch 'House of Wax' to see Chad Michael Murray running around. So when I got this soundtrack from a friend I had very low expectations, but I was pleasently surprised.While the soundtrack is not one of the greatest I've ever heard, it has a good flow which makes it an easy listen. There are no 'bad songs' or slow points that really make you want to skip a track. It's mixed well with the stand out songs (including Prodigy's ""Spitfire"" & Joy Division's ""New Dawn Fades"") placed in what seems certain intervals throught the album, helping to keep the listeners interest.So, while it's not a great soundtrack, it is actually pretty decent. I'd recommend giving it a listen."
5,Left Handed work surface for Webber Genesis BBQ,"I am very pleases with the product, but much more with the care taken by Sunken Books. This was a replacement item that was very hard to identify for the correct Grill, and the company was very careful to not ship the wrong part, which would result in delay and frustration."
3,Nice replacement part,"Even though it don't fit and was not for my grill, I can tell its a good product. Im out $34 all together and the piece is just sitting by my bed. Its a constant reminder that buying online is always somewhat of a gamble. I don't know how the return process works, if there is any, but I sure don't have the energy or time to figure it out. In short, its a good product. just make sure it is going to fit before you hit ""Submit""."
1,Plagued by Math Errors and Incomplete Formulas,"This book has numerous issues with incomplete formulas, math errors, and poor editing. Many of the questions at the end of the chapters are incomplete and the solutions in the manual often add in information that was not in the question. The solutions manual has lots of numbers transposed and on multipart questions these errors cause all of the answers to be incorrect. In addition, many of the solutions will change par value in the middle of the answer making it very confusing.The editor of this book should be fired immediately."
2,Full of typos,"This book covers the bond market in incredible depth. However, it does so in an incredibly dry and impossible to read sort of way. Also the examples in the book are so riddled with typos that it is possible to tell whether or not your coming to the right solution when you try problems yourself.There is also no sort of answer key in the book at all so its impossible to test yourself on the concepts presented."
3,Just ok,"Some sections of the book were underlined throughout the page. If everything is underlined, nothing is important."
3,Lots of Jargon,"I am a senior majoring in finance at the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management, at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I just got done taking a bond course called: Financial Markets and Interest Rates. For the class we used this text book. Although it is a well-rounded book on bonds, it is very hard to understand if you do not have other examples describing what is going on. My professor who holds an MBA had alternative notes on Microsoft PowerPoint made for us to supplement the hard to understand text. The examples do not fully give a clear idea of what is happening, especially to the beginner learning bonds. I would rate this book 2/5 stars and would look elsewhere for an easier type of book, perhaps a tutorial. This book is used at high level universities including mine and Princeton University. Fabozzi is not fooling around when displaying info on bonds."
5,Wonderful book for the rookie quilter as well as the expert!,"I purchased this book a few months ago and have reviewed it many, many times. The patterns are easy to understand with illustrations in two color combinations. Helpful hints on quilting (as well as on time management so that we can quilt) are sprinkled throughout the book. Testimonies of ""spare time"" quilters help us think through how to find extra time (and energy) in our busy lives to quilt. I highly recommend this book."
5,My Favorite Quilt Book!,I love all the Thimbleberries quilt books but this one is my favorite. I've made many of the projects in this book and can't wait to make more.
2,A view from the other side,"I am reviewing this book only because I have a totally different opinion than all the other reviewers. I found the book to be very poorly organized and cluttered. I had difficulties deciding which fabric the yardage referred to because the legend was two pages later. The same ""hint"" was at the start of every pattern.Mostly I was very irritated to read yet again the suggestion that we get up earlier every day or go to bed late one day a week to have ""quilt time"". Americans don't sleep enough as it is. You should not shortchange yourself further for a hobby. No one's life depends upon finishing this quilt.I found the book so poorly organized that I ended up copying the pertinent portions and burning the book so that I wouldn't inflict it upon some other poor soul. I only bought it for a tree skirt pattern I had seen pictures of and I wish I hadn't. I like the pictures but the rest of the book is useless."
4,My Dog Is Addicted!,My little Yorkshire Terrier is addicted to these. He recently had surgery on one of his back knees and the vet suggested he run on the treadmill to build his muscles up and he runs like made knowing these are his reward. One disadvantage for small dogs is that the treats come in large squares that are hard to break apart. We soak them in water first before breaking them down to the bite size our little Yorkie can handle. The price is on the high side too but the ingredients seem sound and they certainly are a good motivator for our dog at least.
1,Completely Mis-leading Title,"I own a 1995 Montero. The description on Amazon was for pickups AND Monteros between 1983 and 1996. However, the manual only covers Monteros up till 1993. This is false advertising."
4,Just what I needed,"We are looking at purchasing a 1993 Montero and I knew I would need to do some light repair and maintenance, so I found a great deal here at Amazon on the repair manual I was looking for. Great price, fast shipping. I would definitely do business with this company again."
3,Did not quite work for me,"VAGUE SPOILER IN THE REVIEWI thought the writer was being really creative when playing with Kitsune myths and making them integral part of the love story, however I wished everything in the story would have had more depth. Plot is definitely interesting and even a little mysterious at first when we learn that Rusty is trying to remember for years what had happened to him during that accident and dreams that he has.However since the moment Shiro shows up and especially since he reveals himself, the story could not have been more predictable in my opinion. And when I do not know much more about characters when I am finished with the story in comparison to what I knew about them, what makes them tick at the end of the story, to me it is not a good sign. I wished characters had more depth too. Yes, we learned they are in love with each other and that Rusty is feisty and Shiro is dominate and politician, to me it was not nearly enough."
1,Male / Male Erotica,"This book is sold without mentioning once that is a Male gay erotic book, if you are into that might be a great book but I'm just going to give the book to a friend of mine who likes that kind of book. I would have appreciated the knowledge before buying."
1,Evil publisher,"Was forced to purchase this 5lb book, but what is bad, is the publisher ""offers"" the homework site (forces students to buy the brand new book, or extra $$$ for the access codes), and this is the second class, different disciplines, I was forced to try and do work on their slow, glitch filled ""homework"" that takes forever, one question at a time, everybody hates it, teachers push and push it, there has got to be some graft, kickbacks, fees paid to the school something, teachers not wanting to even acknowledge that it's bad, marks right answers wrong, etc etc etc. For the extra $20 a student, it's the students that are some test case, or helping them work out the bugs, meanwhile you get bad grades because the homework counts twice as much as the tests (whoever heard of that?)"
5,Review,"Quality was great, better than expected! Delivery was swift. Not a problem in site for this purchase."
5,Great book!,This book seems easy to follow. It's long-winded but detailed and very informative. Items are easily found and explained with the index. Topics are discussed thoroughly. Very educational!
5,Easy to read and understand,This book should be used in all classrooms. It is great to understand and easy to find what you are looking for. Made my Chem. 110 class a lot better.
3,Pyramids Purposes and Construction,"I was thinking the book would have more ""secret data"" about the pyramids. It doesn't. It does give the traditional thinking of the purposes of the pyramids. The pictures in the book are excellent. It is an excellent resource book."
2,"Mysteries, What Mysteries?","Far from solving mysteries this book assumes there are none. The mysteries don't even get a mention. Instead we have a catalog of conventional egyptological wisdom and woe betide anyone who dares question it because within academia and the egyptological establishment the author is a widely acknowledged authority on the subject. If you are one of those people who feel safer with fabricated histories in vacuous, glossy coffee-table format then this is just the book for you."
4,One of the best after forever albums!,"This album is bloody amazing after forever are sounding there best there most melodic and the heaviest on this album. Its also a concept story album with a story about a girl unwanted by people. But the only thing that concerns me with this album is the corney parts like the roleplay of the mother and father arguing, its just so scripted and fake ""I hate you"" and its all your fault and errrrr just stop plz!! lol Play the ace songs! Or at least make it sound a tad real. But other than that i love it a good buy. Just a shame they broke up :( lets hope they return sometime in the future for another album ehh?"
3,Invisible Circles,"I was relatively unimpressed with Invisible Circles. After hearing Prison of Desire and Decipher, I had expected better. The sound is still distinctly After Forever, but the lyrics are just silly. A story about a girl who likes to write in her diary that she doesn't like her life because her parents don't like her. And a poorly told story at that. The dialogues between Floor and Sander are hilariously pathetic. Neither one of them is a very good actor. The music is decent enough, but I find this to be a very mediocre album for them."
5,Conceptual masterpiece,"This album is a definite must for anyone who likes goth metal, operatic/symphonic metal or related music. The instrumentals are very deep and create a haunting atmosphere with rich textures. Floor Jansen vocals are gorgeous as always, and they're complemented by the male growler, what makes an interesting contrast. The album tells us a story about a 14-year old girl that has a miserable life and tries to escape from it through Internet and TV. If you are into female fronted operatic metal bands, you'll not be disappointed."
4,The first week of SMBSS!,"This DVD contains the first 4 episodes of SMBSS and the first episode of Zelda, which are:The Bird! The Bird!King Mario of CramalotButch Mario and the Luigi KidMario's Magic CarpetThe RingerThe picture and audio transfer isn't perfect, but for the most part, it's pretty good. The episodes themselves are uncut, and each one is complete with opening and closing credits, and the live action sequences. The interview with Andy Heyward wasn't all that good though, but other than that, you should get this DVD."
3,Other DIC Cartoon,"Super Mario Brother Super Show is more like The Lendge of Zelda, the Adventure of Captain Planet,Sonic The Hedgehoge even Sailor Moon The Best of 93-96 Early'' The Best of 3 Video Game Cartoon!2 Orignal Cartoon of Captain Planet and Sailor Moon, This Movie is Rock, What a game, I Seem Super Mario Bros. Super Show in 1992 and 1993, Awsome in the Orginal Video Game!"
3,Great Suction but a couple of flaws,My 18mth old son also figured out how to work the lever very quickly making spills more probable. I tried turning the lever away from him but it didn't take him long to reach around the back and release the bowl. I had the same issue with the bowl sitting too high for my son to see what he was trying to scoop up. The fork and spoon are great for little hands and the fork has sharper points making it easier to stab food (this may be seen as a negative since they could stab themselves instead). Now that my son (2yrs old) has outgrown throwing his food and sits in a booster seat at the table (i.e. sits taller so he can see into his bowl) I found it to be very useful to help steady his food while learning to become proficient at stabbing/scooping his food.
3,Where is the editor?,"Henry James is hard enough to read in the original English, so I'm inclined to give considerable leeway to the unnamed translator of this volume, who generally tackles the author's convoluted sentences with courage and skill. Still there are enough instances where the translator seems to throw in the towel prematurely--and not a few where he or she is flat-out wrong--to dissuade me from giving this book a higher rating. What is even less pardonable, however, is that the book is riddled throughout with typographical and production errors. Chapter 34, where practically every vowel is accented, nearly drove me out of my mind. If the cost of easy access to e-books is sloppy or non-existent editing, then the cost is simply too high."
5,Every bit of that FIVE star rating,"Just about everything the guy did musically was pure genius. His work could,and often did,flirt & flow into varying musical genres sometimes in the same song! Sure, that sounds like a recipe for a real mess(read:crap) but not in the hands of a true visionary,such as is the case with Serge here!This early album,though,demonstrates his smokey jazz-club stylings in full force and it's pretty straight forward; the real epitome of Cool.The song ""Intoxicated Man"" is reason enough to purchase this,but it's all just as killer with no filler.Dont be a schmuck and let it go out of print,daddy-o - buy it and thank me later..."
5,Connection to heat tape made simple,"This connector kit is solid built, and built to last! It is so easy to install your heat tape to,any child could do it, it is fool proof! The cord is extra heavy duty almost over kill and the body of the unit is not some flimsy cheap fall apart piece of junk you normally find associated with some store bought already attached thermostat controlled heat tapes. You will like this Easy Heat system over anything else on the market, period!"
4,Cord too short and not waterproof. Otherwise excellent product.,"Easy to hook-up and works well. Power indicator light is helpful to know the unit has power. My only complaint is the cord is too short. Yes, extension cords can be used but another 3' of cord would be nice. Be aware that the units are not waterproof and if they get wet, they will stop working."
5,"A ""Must Read"" book for all parents.","Every now and then a book comes along which combines wisdom, common sense, and a touch of genius. Keith Hafner has journalized 20-years experience working with children into this ""Must Read"" book for all parents. Get it!"
3,My Review,"My girlfriend suggested it to me, so I purchased it, I tried one of these bad boys out and never looked back. :)"
1,Good for learning letters,"My two and a half year old daughter does enjoy this book when I read it to her and help her with the stickers. It is nice that the stickers are actually vinyl and can be reused easily. If your child is into sticker books, however, this one could be a disapointment. It just has letters...not too much of interest there."
1,Curly Stickers,"I really love the idea of this book, but when we got it and punched out the alphabet stickers they were so flimsy that they would curl up when trying to stick them to the book and would not stick at all. I ended up throwing them away. I have seen other reusable stickers that were better and wish they would improve the stickers that come with the book. I now am looking for some reusable alphabet stickers somewhere else so my kids can use them with this book."
1,Not impressed,"This stickers hardly stick to the pages, and the book tells only half of the whole ""Chicka chicka boom boom story."""
3,will this work for a 2002 Chevy Suburban??,I need to know know where to place it !! like the connectors do i need to take out the main one or plug it into the 9 point plug in that is by it self??
5,A great idea,"I bought this for my 02 Chevy Avalanche and it is an excellent solution to adding mp3 audio input. After installing, it takes the place of the CD function on the factory Delco radio and the sound is as clear as playing a CD. Its a bit of work to install, but doable by anyone."
2,Warning: step away from this book!,"The book shrouds various tatters of the subject matter in dense, poorly worded compound sentences, dressed with excessive full color graphs and charts. It was full of limitless qualifications, redundancies, and undefined terminology (there was no glossary).If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in a position of having to actually have to wade through this, (for a class, for example), expect to find flatly unexplained contradictions in fact. (EG, the chapter on population sates that the rate of human population increase is steadily increasing, but then go on to repeatedly quotes Joel Cohen who states that it had slowed down in the 1970's).Trying to study from it was a big enough ordeal to put most people off the subject for life. This textbook's abdication of explanatory rigor is probably one of the reasons the environmental movement has not gotten the popular traction it deserves.Truly this textbook is a case study in obfuscatory humbug."
1,Let down,"When I saw this as being available,could'nt wait to get my hands on it! Once I listened to it,completely let down. Where are the original versions of IOU & I want it to be real! Thats what I remember,thats what I have on vinyl! Being a part time DJ,& using only CD's,I wanted this as part of my collection. Turns out the remixes do not have the energy that the originals do. The review did not say the original versions were not on it. I love a good remix as much as the next person,but the original is what I remeber mixing,and what was heard on the radio when it hit. Sorry Johny,if you are going to make a greatest hits,keep it original,I played this for other friends & DJ's and they were also disappointed."
4,Great for Road Warriors !,"I travel every week out of town. Frequently I find myself with leftovers or take-out food and no silver ware. This is very easy to pack, more durable than plastic and has served me well. Would recommend to other travelers--even campers."
4,"Beautiful, baffling, boring, brilliant","What a remarkable book! There are passages inside this novel that outshine almost any writer working today; characters who come alive in the space of a few sentences; ideas that no other writer would touch. At times, this seems like the perfect combination of James Joyce with Harry Potter--literary magic for an adult. But then there are other momnents when the book falters, stutters, and practically disintegrates. Long, pretentious passages; plotting that goes awry; characters who fail to make sense. What a strange book--perhaps it wasn't edited, perhaps no one helped the writer make sense of what could have been a genuine masterpiece. Still, if you've got the urge to disappear into a strange mind in a strange land, you could do far worse than The First Verse."
5,Almost Blue,I was weaned on the Blue Guides when I first did international travel. I loved the detail about towns and historic sites in those guides along with the suggested tours. The Rough Guide lived up to this standard for me. It provided a good level of detail to enjoy our touring with an organzization of the information that made sense.
4,Good Product,"This book lacked almost any pictures. It really wasn't the reference to whip out while passing through the countryside on a tour bus. The layout was logical, though. I used it in combination with another book that supplied the pictures and maps. I really liked the comprehensive history section which the picture book lacked. It gave me an understanding of the travails the Irish have suffered."
2,Totally disappointed,"Read the other reviews and was very excited, but I thought this turned out to be one of the worst guidebooks I've ever purchased. If you're going to hit absolutely every city in Ireland, then maybe it's okay, but really who's going to do that? I thought it needed more detail on things like food and hotel recommendations. There aren't any good maps, even of the city centers. It's almost completely black and white, with very few pictures. The pricing codes are difficult to understand and therefore completely unhelpful. Pretty bummed about this book."
3,Good for the price,"I am used to using Kitchen Aid tools with KA cookware (nonstick). We are waiting (still) for our items to arrive from the mainland, so I bought a Rachel Ray set of cookware (excellent buy and good-feel pans!). We were having some problems with the plastic utensiles I thrift shopped for, so I bought these. They are not ""strong"" or sturdy but they clean up well. The price was around $6.00 so I got my money's worth. I don't use them on a daily basis, though, so I don't know how they will hold up to long term use."
3,Solid But Unspectacular,"This is probably Gainsbourg's least interesting 70's album, despite the controversial subject matter. Musically it's fairly one-dimensional, just straight ahead rock n' roll basically, with a generous helping of cheesy female backing vocals and more electric guitar than usual. I would tell you about some of the highlights but this is one of those albums where all of the songs are so similar in tone and execution that they all just blend in together. Still, it's a lot of fun and a pretty solid listen. Just don't expect the inventiveness apparent on some of his other albums."
1,Who needs Ex-Lax?,"I thought I was going to die. Cramping, bloating, severe diarrhea, rectal bleeding and total exhaustion. It took me a few days to realize I didn't have the plague but the new Brachs star brite candies I bought from Amazon were killing me. It says it is made with Splenda on the front of the package so I figured it would be a good sugar free candy. Guess again, the main ingredient on the label is Isomalt. Some kind of synthetic sugar substitute. It even says on the rear cover that excessive consumption can cause a laxative effect. A serving size is 3 candies. I should have just ate poison. This is not food."
2,Not quite a stock pouch,"If this is a repro stock mag pouch I don't know how our boys in WWII figured out how to put them on the stocks. The pouch holds the 15 rd. magazines just fine, however when I went to put it on the rifle I had to take the barrel & reciever out of the stock to slide it over the stock as it would not slide over the charging handle or fit by sliding over the butt-plate end of the rifle. It was a tight fit and the seams ripped a few stiches while getting it on. Once on the rifle, I inserted the magazines and they made the fit even worse. I ended up giving the pouch to another M1 Carbine guy who wanted it just for the sake of having it. I will not buy another. Not a bad buy if you want it for a 3"" Pistol belt but does not work as well as I hoped."
2,Floppy disk? DOS?,"While there are some fair to good suggestions for anyone who is trying to start up a Human Resources department - one of the things that drew me to this book was the mention that there were electronic forms that came with the book. The forms are on floppy disk and are available in DOS. Not a really good choice for a person who has been working with Windows 95 for years.The one thing that I was able to use when I first got the book was the layout of Job Descriptions. I couldn't use the ones on the disk, but the layout in the book is fairly good. However, I soon discovered other, better books on the market and have shelved this one."
5,Very helpful!,"As an office manager for a small company, I found this book invaluable. Everything from forms to procedures and ""how to"" information. Lots of info for your $$!We were not particularly automated so this was great for guidance as I set everything up. I designed my own forms so I didn't have any problems with the book but the reviewer below is correct, I don't recall a lot of computer reference."
3,pager case,"The pager case is sturdy and the velcro closure is strong. However, the belt loop is made of plastic....looks like it won't take much to rip loose from the case and not what I was expecting. I wanted a clip not something the belt slides through. Also, the case was advertised as being for small pagers but no dimensions were given. Unfortunately the case is much larger than my pager so I am unable to use it. Disappointed in the advertising more than the product."
3,"Well reported, but a (mostly) slow read","This book is a little dense and sometimes repetitive. For those looking for a medical mystery this book will probably not be very satisfying. The point of this book, which is made several times and then some, is that the response from federal agencies to the 2001 anthrax attacks was not perfect. And those mistakes cost lives.The history of US anthrax production was interesting and offered perspective, and the chapter on the US Justice Departments attack and smear of a scientist was good and should have been developed more."
3,Quick summary of the attacks,"I read this book after hearing the author interviewed on NPR. While the author evidently knows the subject matter well, the book reads as if it were written to be read aloud rather than just read. Confusingly, it's not really written chronologically, either.But it's pretty good anyway, and offers an excellent, though brief, summary of the events of fall 2001 without dwelling overly long on subjects (like September 11) that we're all quite familiar with. The author also spends some time reviewing the ""person of interest"", Stephen J. Hatfield, and his background. It's a short read (I read it cover to cover in about a day), but it's worth it."
3,Superficial,"Disappointing and superficial. Beside the errors (Thompsontwice refers to Trent Lott as being from Louisiana, not Mississippi; and introduces, out of the blue, someone named ""Hatch"", presumably Orrin), she really reveals nothing new. For instance, it was widely known in gossip circles that the FBI Executive heading the initial anthrax probe in Florida had just purchased a home in suburban Virginia with his mistress, potentially distracting and disrupting the FBI probe , but Thompson missed this."
3,Blue Shirt,Ordered a extra large for my husband - it was really small. It fits me and i am normally a med to large woman. I do love this shirt. So be careful on the size.
1,didn't work!,im a 13 year old girl with bad acne. i tried this product and it didnt work at all! in fact it made my acne worse! This product made my face break out with big hard sore pimples that wouldnt pop and took a long time to go away. most of them i had over a week or up to 2 weeks! i would not recemend this to anyone!
5,Great!!,"I've been using this for two weeks daily and have seen a huge difference in my skin! Blackheads have disappeared and the small amount of blemishes I had disappeared right away. The first day I noticed that my skin was a little dry after using it, and have since started putting on lotion after I wash my face and the problem cleared up ASAP."
2,Does not work for me.,"This product is too thick and does not work at all for me. When i finish using it, the blackheads are still there. Also, it says to use daily, but I definitely would not recommend that. Just does not work...for me."
4,"You have to like this sort of stuff, even if you are a Billy Joel fan.","Once again, NOT an SACD as advertised on amazon marketplace, but it is a superbly recorded standard red-book CD. Amazing solo piano and composition. Billy Joel is even more gifted than I thought he was!"
3,"Nothing special, though pleasant enough","I am a huge fan of Billy Joel's more popular (hate to even use that word) work. I'm not sure what I was expecting with this CD, but I think perhaps I was expecting classical music with a hint of something that would let me know Billy Joel was behind it. I don't hear that in this CD. Don't get me wrong; it is a perfectly lovely CD with plenty to like about it. However, there is nothing here that sets it apart from other piano CDs. Perhaps that is just what Billy had in mind."
2,Copycat,"When I listen to these works, I hear bits and pieces of other composer. It is 10 bars of Beethoven, 2 bars of Joel, 6 of Mozart, 16 of Bach, 4 bars of Joel, 24 of Rachmaninov, 12 of Chopin, etc. Unfortunately there is very little of Billy Joel in these works.The recording is great and the music is pleasant enough to listen to, but it feels as if he heas been copying and pasting from other works.It is also all very old-fashioned. This kind of music was written more than a hundred years ago - classical music has developed in new ways, but there is nothing of that in CD.I was disappointed."
4,good,The ball was really good. I wouldnt suggest letting it touch the concrete or road. seems to wear off real fast!
2,Might have to open and check before accepting,"Broken item can be shipped.(not known if it was damaged during packaging or shipping)They can ship one stove after another and ask you to return one. In this case you have to contact customer service agent and get a bar-code,contact Fedex service center to schedule the time, and wait for them to come that you don't know will come at what time(the time range spreads morning to evening.)And should be prepared to get sarcastic apology from a lady whose name is...This is what I experienced.However, I like the stove so much. So...as for me, money was not all that I needed to pay."
4,Unbiased Review-Good DVD,"I used to love watching Penny, Brain, the Inspector, and co. when I was younger so adding this DVD to my collection was a no-brainer. I only wish that UAV had put the episodes in order. I'm not really sure why a company would release a series and not have them in order...oh well. With all that being said, still a great DVD for a great price."
2,Overrated,"This is the most overrated film I've seen in a while. I hoped for a violent, sexist, stark, disturbing biker film, and I got cheese. The motorcycles are awful, some of them are like dirt bikes and others no self-respecting biker would ever ride. The Satans colors look like iron-on patches. The violence is very antiseptic, with very litte gore, almost no nudity, and no realism. The plot and continuation are pathetic; could someone explain to me how the manniken-haired ""good guy"" got up that mountain so quick at the end to fight Firewater, or better yet, why? Also, the picture and sound quality are abyssmal, rendering whole sections of the movie unwatchable. A total waste of time and money, and completely misrepresented by anyone who gives it a good review."
3,adamson's best,"Al Adamson's best film - BY FAR!! A lot of Al's work was patch work schlock combining footage from unfinished films, but this was a project that was finished from begining to end. Although not as technicaly polished as EASY RIDER from the same year it sure has dated a lot better and their is not a dull moment in the film. Russ Tamblyn and Scott Brady help give this better acting than other Adamson films and it is the most violent and nastiest biker film i have seen (their is also some dark humor). so if your a fan of horror/exploitation films this is a must see!!"
4,Important topic - not easy to read,"The author analytically picks apart Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Church concept, point by point, using Scripture. At first, I thought Sundquist was a bit hard on Warren, but in the end I came to agree that Warren is dead wrong in his thinking on many facets of his PDC and PDL ideas. He ties Warren's concepts directly to Carl Jung's heretical occultish thinking and the end result is scary. Many people are being deceived by the church growth movement. My opinion of Sundquist's writing style is not high, but he nevertheless drives his points home. I read Warren's Purpose Driven Life many years ago when it first came out and thought he had some valid and useful points at the time, but when you stir ""dung"" into the mix the result is not pretty and this is what Warren has effectively done in his Purpose Driven Church book. A good book to read with this one might be Schaeffer's book entitled, ""The Great Evangelical Disaster."""
1,Who is Sundquist?,"I am not really sure who James Sundquist is. I have read his writings on Warren, and find them to be off base in several key areas. Some of his statements are plainly false. I had occasion to question Sundquist via email on his false statements, but only received a veiled threat to drag my name through the mud.This book is a great example of Evangelical Christianity's bad side. An entire book based on exposing another ministry's faults is sad."
1,A Useless opposition to something God is obviously blessing.,"This book in a nutshell is a waste of time. This author, ( who by the way has, in my opinion, no authority to write on something hes never achieved himself), attempts at all cost to discredit a book and its principles which are clearly biblical, and obviously been a blessing to many. He does it all in the name of ""testing the spirits"". With all due respect Sir, The spirit that should really be tested is yours.Maybe you should use your publishing company to bless the body instead of dividing it."
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is great! The Walk Of Shame is a great song. Very energetic. Also, I love Signed Sealed Delivered. It's worth owning."
5,A MASTER PIECE,"This CD has every thing Good music,Good meaning,Good sound,And most important of all ,it makes you think ,think about emotions, your self, life ,love ,being powerfull ,being confeident , this Cd makes you feel like a hero from within, it brings up what's in you infront of you , and also it's relaxing . so enjioy it ."
2,the night the page turner died,"Finishing this book was a bitter pill. I felt as if womeone tricked me. Some books are not necessarily bad, But contain a dull story disguised under a really thick and ""edgy"" surface. Survior was one of those books. It starts off well enough. The first half is quite catchy. There a neat loittle quirks in the characters and the writing style is casual enough so the humor does not seem forced. But then the actual plotline comes in. BAD BAD BAD. It appears as if Chuck Palaenguck created these very offbeat roles in the story and then had nothing to do with them. So an elaborate over the top storyline takes place. It is only supported by having the characters suddenly able to do impossible things, like tell the future. bad job Chuck. you pissed me off with your crap writing.two stars for readability and the first part of the book. but thats all. YOU THE READER OF AMAZON! DON'T READ THIS BOOK."
2,weak gimmickry doesn't carry,"this has to be the most overrated author on amazon. there's a huge divide in his audience -- traditional / educated fiction fans seem to be very disappointed with his style. on the other hand there's a strong cult-like contingent of fans who aren't traditional readers.it's my opinion that anyone who has read a decent amount of fiction will see right through this guy's prose techniques. i guess it's good that the masses have found something to like, beyond comic books, but that doesn't make it good writing.and even though chuck personally attacks people who give him bad reviews, he'll not get good reviews until he writes something better."
3,Judge for yourself,"Read most of the reviews on this book. Almost everybody compared it to fight club. Some stated that it was better, while others said it seemed too similar, and yet others said it wasn't up to par. All I have to say is don't buy this book if you have already seen fight club (read fight club), all of the people who reviewed this book compared it to fight club, or only bought it because fight club was so great. If you are going to buy this book, buy it because the plot interests you, not because fight club was so brillant. I bet most of the people who got to this page, only got here because they did a search on 'fight club.' Now you are here, and if you learned anything from the movie, you wouldn't buy this book. You don't have to form some kind of alter ego to tell yourself that buying this book will satisfy you. Will it? Or will you have to go out in buy 'Choke' and 'Diary' and any other new works by this author?"
1,Stunk!!!!,The story was terrible. Didnt care for any of the characters. Couldn't put it down cause I was just trying to get to the end in hopes it got better.... It didn't. The best thing about it was it was a pretty quick read and I will now avoid Palahniuk in the future. No idea why everyone loves this book. Dont get caught up in the hype. It Stinks.
4,One of Chuck Palahniuk more accesable books,"Survivor is a good first book for someone who isn't sure if they are going to like Chuck Palahniuk or not. Not as in your face as Fight Club (a personal favorite) and certainly not as wacked as Invisable Monsters, Survivor is an excellent commentary on our society and the messed up role of religion and role models. In all a good read that is very well written."
5,Great Read From A Great Writer,"You have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to read this book, but that is part of the beauty of because it takes you into a world that you will never experience for yourself. Every character and situation is over-the-top, but that is what makes it work. I am looking forward to every book that Palahniuk writes and his magazine articles are interesting as well."
5,great book,"the chapter about lobster is the best. i've re-read it several times and i've introduced it to friends, who have been awed by its awesomeness."
4,I'm a Survivor,"My opinion, Chuck Palahniuks third best book, which still makes it great. The characters are great, jokes are great. Definitely an unorthodox book. If you want a great story thats a little out of the norm, this is a good start."
3,Survivor is no Fight Club,"I was a little surprised when Survivior started at the end of Branson's story and worked its way backwards, so events in the novel unfolded backwards. After I again got used to this format (which got a little annoying), the story itself just did not hold together. Fight Club was fast-paced and dramatic, but Survivor dragged. At 2/3 through the novel, I could care less about Branson, the set-up, or his destructive ways, and I felt that Palahniuk's sharp wit was bitter rather than edgy, as in Fight Club. The book was okay but I will not read it again."
5,Keeps you hooked...,Survivor tells the story of a man who is the last remaining member of a religious death cult and how his life changes outside of it. The characters and story in this book will keep you hooked all the way through. Chuck P is a master!
5,Palahniuk: Master of cynicism,"After reading and viewing Fight Club I became a fan of many of Chucks Books. I felt that this book, Survivor, just added to his collection of books that have very quotable antedotes within every chapter. His cynical characters always seem to relate to me in some way though i am not as radical in any way as they are. i feel that for those who like to read about a world that has the main character focused on what is really happening, i would reccomend a lot of chuck's books."
3,Dissapointing...,"Fight Club is one of my favorite movies so I decided to pick up another of Chuck's novels first, rather than read a book with a plot I already knew. i had really high expectations, but sadly I can't say that they were met. The writing is merely ok, but perhaps my standards have been raised after reading writers like James Joyce in my english lit class. i found a lot of the cultural references a bit forced, not as fresh and witty as the fight club film. the plot was weak on symbols and development, instead inserting bizarre occurances in an attempt to shock, which i saw coming from a mile away anyhow. still, it was an interesting and nowhere near terrible read, and the author has a clever take on pop culture, but i thought it was better represented in fight club, which i will read sometime in the near future. i would give it 2.5 stars if it would let me."
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","I was first introduced to Palahniuk after reading ""Fight Club"". It quickly became one of my favorite books and I would recommend it to anyone. Because I was so pleased with ""Fight Club"" I picked up ""Survivor"" in hopes of a witty and original book I could thoroughly enjoy and rave about. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find it just to be okay.There is nothing fresh and new about ""Survivor"". After reading it I felt it was just ""Fight Club"" without the humor. Even though the plot was completely different, the characters felt like the characters from ""Fight Club"". I was really hoping for something fresh and witty, but ""Survivor"" just doesn't quite deliver it.""Survivor"", however, is a quick read and it will keep you entertained. But it's forgetable and doesn't leave you with much."
3,"Entertaining, But Not All of What Chuck's Capable Of","Any other who publishes more than one novel can fall into a little bit of a rut. Characters start to seem similar, plots seem somewhat stale and recycled and an overall sense of deja-vu tends to overrun the work. Chuck Palahniuk, when he wrote this book, was in a little bit of a rut.First off, it seems as though most off his leading female characters are begining to seem a little bit like Marla from Fight Club. His writing style is much the same in this book as in Fight Club but it seems, at times, as though the narrators of both Fight Club and Survivor are the same person in different situations.Overall, however, the plot and the story were great. It is very funny in places and offers a very unique view of the world, as does all of Palahniuk's books. If you've never read one of Chuck's books before, pick up Fight Club or Choke first, then move onto this."
4,Surviving is Tough,"After seeing David Fincher's rendition of Chuck Palahnuik's ""Fight Club"", this author has been a bit of a role model for me. Palahnuik strives to uncover the depression that glazes over society ten-fold. He did it in Fight Club with Jack and Tyler Durden, and Tender Bransen is the next victim. From the first chapter (which is 49, and the last is 1), Palahnuik delivers a masterpiece outlining people's meaningless lives and their pursuit of happiness. Call it a twist of John Locke's ideaology, but Palahnuik improves with each book. Although Survivor is not as good as Fight Club, Survivor depicts the ""15 minutes of fame"" with unbelieveable truth.Palahnuik's novels are never a hard read, however, its disturbing sidenotes and descriptions make this book a tough one to forget. ""Survivor"" is a magnificent novel; a quick read with some great meaning and wonderful moral."
4,One of Chuck Palahniuk's Best,Learned about Palahniuk from a co-worker. I knew that he wrote fight club and I knew I had to read some of this other works. I read this after reading Lullaby and Diary. l I thought this showed how some people are willing to be anything as long as they are relevant. This is a typical Palahniuk work in regards to examining the dark side that makes up people. The book opened up right away and caught my attention. I feel as though he could have developed a link with the reader to the main character but it is often difficult to do when your characters are dark and have experienced as dark of a life as Branson. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to examine the psyche of themselves and open up our minds to the struggles we are lucky to avoid.
4,Survivor,"Survivor, writeen by the author of Fight Club was an excellent book.The book catches your attention within the first couple pages. A possesed man realizes that the hardship he had in the past wont haunt him anymore.The book also has many insightful ideas. Like how to get stains out for any surface. Although this book is about a physco, he is very smart, and gets the reader very consumedI reccomend this book to many people for the fact that i hate reading, yet i couldnt get my head out of the book.I rate this book a solid 4, and i enjoyed reading it."
5,Excellent,"I loved ""Survivor"". It is a brilliant satire on many different aspects of American society and just overall a fun novel to read. Tender Branson is a unique and often hilarious character and you can't help but become attached to him as you read his story through his own eyes. I am now working on reading Palahniuk's other novels after reading this one."
4,Great Satire in a weird pensive way,"I must admit my ignorance....I thought it was about a alternitive rock star at first that became a prepackaged lean cuisine for todays society. I was wrong but right. It was about a pre-packaged lean cusine for todays society but all wrapped up in evangelist jim and tammy PTL way.I thought the first three chapters were a little sluggish but so far all I have read from Mr. Palahnuik has been. I thought this was very thought provoking considering all the current american idol make over of everyday people, who can sing, to turn them into icons.Okay, so this book was about a kid from a cult living in the big world but not living. He was programmed to do all the things he does and hates it. Then he meets Fertility the girl who would change his mind on several things and make him question the abuse he has been enduring. Lots of self talk in this book and observations that will make you laugh and make you sad.Over all I liked it in a kooky thoughtful real people way."
3,Not as good as excpected but ok,"I wanted to read a book like Fight club (which I have never read) but I saw that movie so I bought this instead. I do not regret that since this book had some good sections which was entertaining. However I found it slow and not so captivating as lets say Stephen Kings books. Not even close. It was an ok book would not really recommend it, infact at the end I just wanted the book to be finished already..! I would buy Fight club instead I think it would be better but I don't know =)."
3,wandering in the unlikelihood,"I really enjoy this kind of narrative style, but there are just too many unlikely situations to make the protagonist(s) jump from one situation to another completely different, and this happens far too much. The ending is written as if the book should fit a fixed number of pages: the chapters get shorter and their points more random and unconnected. Fertility's ability is used in trivial ways except once (which is brilliant), especially at the end, which seems to be used just to end the book, despite how unlikely it is. In short: the book let me down after having read the Fight Club."
4,Like Nothing You Have Ever Read,"Such an original concept, if you like Kurt Vonnegut this is a must read...brings a modern day feel to satirical writing"
5,Masterpiece,"I truly enjoy this novel, almost finished. It is hilarious, smartly written, entertaining and at the same time it touches so many of our modern day problems, our modern psyche. It is about boredom of everyday life as well as the continued feeling of helplessness in dealing with what the world throws at us, our increased expectations from life and others. So I mean it as a great compliment when I say this book is NEVER boring and would recommend to everyone, everyone."
4,Different,"The book has a different narrative than I am used to, the construction of the history is very catchy, totally worth it."
5,amazing imagination,over the top satire. Best I've read since Tom Robbins. It just keeps coming at you.
3,Kind of a disappointment,"A member of a former religious cult becomes an evangelist hero and with the help of a precognitive woman finally learns the truth about himself and his world. Palahniuk has some interesting observations about late 20th Century society in ""Survivor,"" but ultimately this novel is much more unsubtle and bitterly sarcastic than ""Fight Club,"" his previous effort. In the end, I couldn't really see the point of this book, although it is well-written and entertaining in parts."
3,Entertaining but was expecting more....,"First novel I have read of Chuck Palahniuk. While looking for something new to read the line on the cover ""author of Fight Club"" caught my eye. Having seen and enjoyed the movie I thought I'd try reading this. While I was entertained and found his satiric commentary of American culture humorous, I was just expecting more. Maybe I should read ""Fight Club?"""
5,Ready for some fun?,"This book is amazing. No seriously A-Mazing. Palahniuk's writing is so unique and enertaining tht this book dang near ruined my GPA, I couldn't stop reading it during class. The story is told so well, at first it just seems that this guy grew up in a church group and now lives a quiet life, but the more you read, the more you find out and parts of the story finally start to make sense and add up. The book is, like all other Palahniuk novels, littered with the lewd, disgusting, (...), hilarious true life facts that make his books that much more fun to read. Forget M. Night Shamalan (sic), this guy is the master of the surprise twist. Pick up his book, please, it really is worth reading, but be warned, it contains graphic descriptions of suicide, (...)peripherals, sexual activities, and lot's of other stuff I won't mention here. All of that aside, READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Am I missing something?,"Well...to start, I really liked the screen adaptation of ""Fight Club"". As I understand it, ""Fight Club"" was filmed very faithfully...very close to the novel. But where to begin about ""Survivor""? For starters, you'll never develop any real feelings pertaining to the novel's characters...they're bland, annoying and totally devoid of any personality. You'll constantly be shouting at Tender Branson, the lead character, to shut up over and over in your private thoughts. I found myself wishing the characters would just stop talking. They drone on and on and on and on...endlessly. And they don't even do it in an interesting manner!!! It's kind of like they've all had their souls sucked out of them...and you will too if you read this novel. Ugh."
1,"irritating characters, unfocused plot, a bit forced","I picked up this book expecting a good solid satire, but was disappointed. Much of the book is nothing but a bunch of aimless rambling about everything from how to commit suicide to how to how to remove blood stains. One knows from the way the book is written that nothing is meant to be taken seriously however. The author seems overly concerned with making people laugh. His style got old very quick with me. After the first few chapters I started getting annoyed by the characters, their names (i.e. Fertility Hollis) and the overall lack of focus. The story doesn't seem to have any solid sense of direction, jumping from one thing to another. If anyone carries on a conversation like the characters do in this book, they would be considered insane."
2,"A quick and entertaining read, but not much more than that.","The characters seemed distant. I did not care for any of them. Some situations seemed very improbable. Most of the novel seemed very sketchy and lacking detail where much detail was needed. It was an entertaining read nonetheless.However, don't expect something more spectacular than Fight Club like I did, because it isn't."
4,what did i miss?,"This is a pretty good book. it's not quite as good as his others but is still a great read. my only problem is that i feel that i missed something in the ending. Lots of reviews have described it as some twist shocker ending and I think i missed it. What was the ""escape"" Tender had to find in the end? I don't mean to be dense but i don't get it..."
5,"A dark look at religion, life, and love","In Survivor, Palahniuk show's that people think of god as nothing more than a tool used to satisfy their own needs. Palahniuk makes a man marketable to the world by pumping him full of steroids, undergoing surgery to alter facial features, and saying yes to everything. Survivor shows that people are in control of nothing in their lives, the future has been planned, there are no wrong moves. Palahniuk put's life in a different, darker, perspective, and I loved reading about it. Survivor is a great read that makes you think twice about what you think is beautiful, the things you see on television, and what you are reading."
4,"Entertaining, nonetheless...","Although I have read several of Chuck Palahniuk's books and there are much better ones out there, Survivor was exactly what I have come to expect from Mr. Palahniuk. It is entertaining and surprising, yet defiant. Chuck Palahniuk has a skewed view of the world and it is evident in any of his books you choose to read, it's not a bad thing though, you'll find it to be a refreshing change from the humdrum of everyday life. Palahniuk and most of his main characters are skeptics and more often than not you'll find looking through the kaleidoscope of his writing to be a sort of awakening from the boring rant of American Suburban Pop Culture. Survivor is definitely worth a read, I also recommend Fight Club and Lullaby."
5,An Apoclaypse Of The Self,"Chuck Palahniuks finest novel thus far is both a satire worthy of Voltaire and Swift, and a stunning vision of a society in thrall to ennui, celebrity, self-destruction and media sponsored religion. Written in the same deceptively simple first person style as ""Fight Club"" ( if you've seen the film of that novel, you may, like me, hear Tender Branson, ""Survivor's"" protagonist, narrating his story in the hushed, cultured tones of Ed Norton ), this is the stuff of contemporary nightmares, cataloguing as it does in recollective flashback, the progress of a not-so-innocent former member of a religious death cult, as he journeys through the terminally banal and apocryphal culture of late 20th century western culture. Martha Stewart meets David Koresh by way of Brett Easton Ellis and the denouement can only be an apoclaypse of the self. Ironically this is simultaneously one of the funniest and most terrifying visions of self immolative angst that you'll ever read."
4,"Sick, twisted, and hilarious...","I refer to this book as American Pycho meets Fight Club. Brilliant, witty writing. I read it in 2 days."
2,Popular Nihilism,"Chuck Palahniuk writes in a very specific style, its just a shame that I find said style so irritating, his novels can be likened to Irvine Welsh, but none of his characters have the substance of the great Mark Renton, they are mere toys whom Palahniuk uses to make a point, and make it he does.His novels are filled with social commentary and interesting facts, but this lack of substance means you only read Palahniuk on the off chance he might have something interesting to say about sex or drugs, not for the characters nor the story.Frankly this is a book for teenage boys and Marilyn Manson fans, gimmicky and ""nihilistic"", another way to alienate your parents and look cool at the same. Want real writing? Want real characters and nihilism, go read Trainspotting"
3,fluff.,"I was brought to reading this book due to Fight Club the movie. I really enjoyed the movie...I thought this book was okay. This is the first book that I have read by this author, but I wasn't that impressed. While it had some very funny moments...overall it just seemed like a lot of fluff to me. And, what's worse, I felt confused at the end. I found the story to be hip with no guts. The story was a little predictable too. Okay, okay, some parts were very funny...but that's about it."
4,"Stains, planes and automobiles","Palahniuk, through his carachter Tender Branson, shows us how to remove stains, details the nomenclature of artificial flowers and plants, and maps out how to travel the USA in a pre-fabricated home. His writing style, to me, is original and effectively tells the story of a cynical-yet-passive cult member who survives his cult's call for mass-suicide, and becomes uber-famous. The way Palahniuk tells this story -- paragraphs of plot and dialoge divided by related facts, such as ""how to remove a bloodstain from silk"" -- is what makes this book one of the coolest books I've read in a while. Very entertaining."
5,Facinating storytelling -- Must be true!!,"The first rule about Palahniuk books is you don't talk about Palahniuk books. The second rule about Palahniuk books is everything dies sometime, it's unavoidable. The third rule about Palahniuk books is always expect something new and different. The fourth rule about Palahniuk books is you don't talk about Palahniuk books. Can't wait for number 3."
2,nihlism only goes so far,"So you say you loved Fight Club, both the movie and the book? And you want more?Well, you think you want more.After reading this book, you'll realize that Chuck Palahniuk delivered exactly what he told you to expect: more nihlism and confusion leavened with a bit of cleverness (both in plot and dialogue)...but like the sixth or so childhood Haloween candy bar, you soon realize that you're not satisified, you're just feeling queasy."
5,Muahahaha,"""You won't be able to tell your friends about this book. You'll feel dirty just listening. And in the end it will be one of your favorites ever. Palahniuk's brilliance is his ability to wrap subtlety inside of blinding excess. He's like a guy who punches you in the face to disguise the fact that he's putting $100 in your pocket"" I am quoting a review of another Chuck book, 'Choke'. That is pretty much my opinion. It has so many memorable quotes that your head will be spinning, and this guy is a brilliant writer. I actually ""read"" this as an audiobook, my first, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, because the voice was just as I had imagined it, indifferent and calm. Great great book, but your friends will judge you for reading it. The last sentence was so brilliantly handled that even if you may have thought it wouldn't work, it does, so much."
2,Bizarre and warped,Chuck revels in writing about the thoughts and actions of bizarre and perveted fringe sociopaths. This book follows that strange compulsion. If that sort of thing interests you then by all means read this book.
3,A Good Read,"The rare book that takes too long to get going, but then ends too fast. There is an incredible amount of buildup, and character exposition, only to plunge headlong to the ending. I liked the book, and would recommend it, but the pacing was definitely an issue. If you liked any of his other books, it's that kind of writing. Low on quotation marks, high on sentence fragments."
4,Fun read...,"So much of this story was ingenious...a little (lot) hard to believe, but I think believability is not the point. I think the author is making social commentary and created a character that is the culmination of our collective insanity. His lead character, Tender Branson, rises to the height of fame and fortune for all the wrong reasons, but it seems that we have worshiped at the altar of commercialism and he is the result. It's the same when he's taken down. The emperor has been found without clothes and we blame him for having believed it.This book is very funny. It's dark, but it's funny. If you liked Fight Club...and I know you did...then this is definitely worth a look."
3,Barely Survived It,"The blurb on the back of the Survivor novel states that this is Chuck Palahniuk's deadpan peak. Well, if this is his peak, then I finally know what it's like to be on the receiving end of premature sex. Despite the witty commentary over religion and celebrities, this book did not come to my fancy. And I'm a guy who loves cynical material over religion. I enjoy the fact that this is about a Tender Branson who has been traumatized by the Creedish Death Cult (Suicide cult) to the point where he has absolutely no desire for sex. But the beginning of the novel was just incredibly excruciating to read. I really have no care what it's like to clean a rich person's home, which is Tender's job away from the cult colony. It seems the book only picked up momentum halfway into the novel and by the end climax--like that between Tender and Fertility, I was not impressed. Sure, it might be life giving in some ways, but it could have been better."
3,Desensitized to people dying? This book is for you.,"The main character, Tender, is an aloof, mid-30s virgin who doesn't care whether he, nor anyone else, lives or dies. He doesn't kill people, but he doesn't attempt to save them either. Such as when they accidently call his phone number, believing it's a suicide hotline, as a last resort before committing suicide.It was an interesting read, but I didn't like the ending, even though it fit with the book's theme. It felt anti-climatic, and I was very unsatisfied with it, with is why I give it 3 stars. The rest of the book has a lot of neat quirks in it to keep the reader interested. I guess in the end, the book has it's impact on me, because my feelings toward this book parallels the main character's feelings toward human life."
3,Modern Youth Wake Up,"Yes...Chuck P. has his own style....yes he is novel....yes he has great social commentary....but I need MORE...I think that Chuck P. has something to offer us...he just chooses to do so in pithy segments of dialogue either externally or internally....as a whole I find the story line to be inconsistent and random...as though he is sitting in front of the computer coming up with the next random act of extremity....""what will shock the reader?""...""what wont they expect?""...it feels more like reading a mystery novel...waiting for the next piece of the puzzle to fall into place and yet the puzzle hasnt been created until the end of the novel...I think that this is a thought provoking novel...with creative attempts at ingenuity...however, the modern youth of america must wake up and smell the coffee cause nonconformity creates conformity"
4,Pretty witty,"Hey - this book does a great job of wrapping you with quarky catch phrases, catchy word tricks and a pretty impressive cast of charaters. The first half of the book is better that the second half but its stil worth the read."
2,Overrated author,"Honestly, Survivor just makes you feel like you have just read an intelligent novel. At first, it started off okay but still a bit strange. But after going deeper into the book, I realized that this book made no absolute sense and kept ""jumping"" if you will. I started to get lost toward the middle of the novel. Now, this is the only novel I have read from Palahniuk for now and with all the positive things I have heard about him, I feel that he is overrated at best. This book is pretty pointless to be honest but I will give him (Chuck) the benefit of the doubt and I'll read Fight Club (his most famous book). But Palahniuk has not impressed me one bit so far."
2,So-so book.,"I am obviously vastly in the minority, but I thought this book was a waste of my precious reading time. It never made a point. It's humor was developed much too slowly and wasn't very funny to begin with. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,A very good book and i am looking froward to reading others,This book is amazing i don't want to give anything away but if you liked fight club then i think your going to like this book.
3,too dark,this book was far too dark for my taste. at times it made me laugh but most of the book just had a very melacholy feel to it. not that that's bad but the characters seem to be a bit bi-polar. what i mean by that is that they are too light one minute and too heavy the next. this book contains a lot of leaps in it depth and characterization.
4,Edgy and unrepentantly bold.,"The author takes that anarchistic sensibility he used in ""Fight Club"" and infused it into a religious death cult and it's lone survivor for amazing results.I found myself mezmerized by the characters and the protagonist's journey toward fame and fortune in a society of sound-bites, media-saavy agents, and ""IN/OUT"" lists.It's a daring journey into the mind of a man who doesn't know where his place is, and I think we can all relate in some way to his dilemma."
2,Bad,"""Survivor"" has the smell of a delicious meal - its bold, frenzied opening carries the aroma of good meat cooking. But Palahniuk is a short order cook serving up thin, insufficient burgers whose only flavoring is a slathering of ketchup. You can salt bad food to save it, but that doesn't make it worth swallowing.This is less an act of literature than a smart-alecky rant. A rant that is neither new nor funny nor intriguing. It is insufferably trite - to the point of being numbing - and coarsely, cheaply repetitive. We're a culture hung up on looks, on money, on fame, on competition, on faith - repulsively so, farcically so. Yeah, so what? That is the ear-splitting sermon of this tiresome book."
2,"Start= Average, Middle= Bloody Boring, End= "" Expected that...""","Ok Chuck P. has been recommended by a lot of people, A LOT! And after reading this I wonder if half of the kids I know are really dumb-ass morons. The book started decent, but after that it dropped to crud. The story was bad, the writing was off, it just wasn't brilliant in anyway shape or form. The messages he is trying to deliver just isn't worth explaining or worth even taking into consideration. I will at least admit there was some parts that made me laugh but that was basically all the book could deliver. Ill give it two stars because it isn't absolute garbage, but it sure is rotting into it."
2,Just OK,"I thought the plot in this book fell a little short. There were some threads that Palahniuk started in the beginning of the book that were intriguing, but he didn't follow them through to the end. Not nearly as interesting as Fight Club."
3,pieces are greater than the whole,"Testing one, two, three...is this thing on?I guess since this is what you would call a satire, Chuck P. is excused from drawing characters that are 3-D. I think that's why I didn't like this book as much as I hoped I would. Never once did I have any connection to any of these characters. And don't tell me that was the point.The story is what you would call imaginative and it's filled with great details. But overall something is missing. The story becomes so surreal at times it becomes disorienting. Wait? How did we get here? I kept finding myself asking.You could say this story tackles too many themes to feel cohesive. Is it predominantly about the shallowness of America? Or the destructive power of religion? I'm not sure I ever felt the two themes mixed into one grandiose theme. But that's just me. I'm not what you would call a genius."
2,I don't get it,"I don't get all the hype surrounding this novel, that is. The previous reviewer has it exactly right. This is mediocre writing passed off as insightful and witty satire. After all, what's easier to satirize than consumerism, religion, and popular culture? Throw in some sex and death, and you have ""Forrest Gump"" for hipsters.There was no suspense, nothing exciting ever happened, and the promised payoff never came. The backwards numbering didn't help, either, as it only increased my annoyance. Better to read some DeLillo or Pynchon or Vonnegut or Ballard, rather than this waste of time."
4,Fly or Fall,"This book written far before the Television show existed has pushed Palahniuk past the ranks of one hit wonders. You begin your sadistic voyage with Tender Branson, a Creedish man who lives as a basic slave in infamy. As the pages begin to count down (literally) so do the number of Creedish cult members after a mass suicide in their community. Tension builds as the Branson is shot into the glare of the public eye being the sole survivor. Palahniuk illustrates the downfalls of selling your soul to a religion and correlates them with selling your soul to the public. His gift for inserting trivial facts of knowledge and combining it with demented characters add up for a book you keep by your side until it's finished. Not exactly Fight Club but a perfect complement to it."
5,"Smart, Entertaining and Original","To start off, this is the second of five Palahniuk books I have read and I would put this one tied at the top (with Rant). The book is somewhat of a fairy tale but the main story is as believable as anything. The way in which this book takes you through one character's journey is hilarious and even though it was written nearly ten years ago, it is even more applicable today. The satire used is incredibly original and would entertain anyone. I do not want to give away too much of this book but overall it is a quick read and I am sure enyone will enjoy it."
3,pretty decent but..,"I can't help but notice that this book screams ""Look how clever I am!"" Many stories are written in a similar narrative, but only Chuck has the balls to use such a one-dimensional attempt at originality, numbering the chapters backward an all. And the awkward insertions of househould cleaning tips are almost embarrassing to read; not to mention that it chops up the flow of the story. The psuedo-psychic female character reminds me of Nicola Six from ""London Fields""...only not as developed or interesting. In fact, Chuck Palahniuk is like a Martin Amis wannabe in many ways. If you want to see a good exmple of a backward story, read ""Time's Arrow"" and don't bother reading all the way to chapter one of this book."
3,"OK, but lacking the edge of Fight Club",I just finished reading this book and I have to say that it was alright. I kept expecting a profound truth in it but the book seemed only to confirm my thoughts on religion in western society. This book may be offensive to some but it does pose an interesting read to open-minded people.
3,Long Way Down (One Last Thing),"Chuck Palahniuk is a very gifted writer of first-person narration as displayed here and in ""Fight Club,"" but his ideas are little more than gimmicks. Sure, I was enthralled by ""Survivor"" most of the way, but it all depended on gimmicks to keep our attention. Did this book really need to count down from page 289 to page 1? No. The book builds and builds and builds...and then goes nowhere. The ending left me very empty and indifferent; the book is great until the last 40 pages or so. Once we hear about the PornoFill, it's all over. Palahniuk needs to focus his ideas better and stop the gimmickry, for God's sake! But for a short, cheap read, it works."
4,Palahniuk is quickly becoming one of my fav. authors,"Alright, novel for novel, I actually enjoyed this one more than the almighty Fight Club. I found the premise to be very original and interesting and I couldn't remember the story lagging or drifting in any way. Also, the little remedy tidbits thrown into the mix here and there were an extra treat. And it's not the type of novel that starts great then slows down and kills itself. It's actually the opposite, which I think will work out for you. Whether satire is new to you or not, or if you think your mind works in a sort-of oddball way, give the book a try."
5,Dude.........,"I was amazed by this book. I watched Fight Club a million times (seriously) so I read the book this summer, which was even better. I decided to read a Palahniuk Book before it had been spoile in the movie theaters, that is probably why I liked Survivor even better. It's filled with the same emotionaly disturbed but loveable characters, and literary middle fingers to modern society as would be expected from Fight Club, but only this time they're more outrageous and unpredictable. So hitch a ride on a moveing house on a flatbed truck, hijack a 747, or just take a stairmaster up and endles imaginary stair well, and get this book."
3,sophmore jinx ?,"I absolutely loved the later works Choke and Lullaby. I found both to be incredibily interesting, sharp and well-crafted works of satire. This one just didn't do it for me. Maybe after Fight Club, Chuck was wrestling with the ""sophmore jinx""? There's obvious effort here and Survivor is a ""good"" book, but I would have to honestly say it's a few stars short of a ""great book"".With Choke I truly cared about the main character's exploits. I waited in anticipation for what loomed next and ultimately turned pages quickly. I could not put it down. Survivor just didn't do it for me. I found it a forced read. There are select moments in which this story shines. Some of the ""bazillion"" metaphors present are dead on hilarious and inciteful. Others are not.It is impossibile to hit a home run with every trip to the plate. This one's a nice effort, but falls short of the fence. I hope to crack Invisible Monsters next."
3,First Palahniuk Book,"Just finished reading. My favorite quote was:""If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself.What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. What we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't red we call gibberish."""
4,"Fun, dark read","This is the first book by Palahniuk I have read. I've enjoyed his unique style so far. Reference elsewhere for details on his style. The dark tones make it difficult to return to consistently over a longer span of time. Reading it again, I would allot chunks of time to finish it quickly and stay within the mindset of the story since jumping from this book to a happy life and back again many times is a bit jarring."
4,good spare,needed this item to replace the original one and worked well. they are just a good as the original ones.
3,the essential funk from brooklyn,"Well done, but not as good as the DJ's early production--16 Top Spins of the early 90's. I wish to purchase the old cd, which was stolen from my car. can any one help?"
1,Too short and wrong dimensions!,"Don't waste your money on this. Although I was very careful picking the correct size, It turned out to be different than advertised. Moreover, this cone is extremely short that It won't even prevent your dog from reaching hot spot. I recommend going for another brand and another seller as it also took so long to arrive.PS: The photo is totally different than actual product."
2,Way too short,"I don't understand what these companies can't make a collar that is actually long enough. I've tried several varieties, and this is more of the same. It basically goes from my dog's neck to not even her nose. Unless she had surgery on her chest, the collar is nearly worthless. I have a 30 pound whippet, and the large fits her neck just fine. If only this product was longer in length, it would be perfect because it is otherwise well made."
2,"Kong E -Collar for Dog , Small .","1 -A cone was way to small for my dog ( Jack Rusell Terrier) .2 -I requested to cancel my item right after i placed , but they ignored my message .3 -My advice to someone that you should go to a store ( Pet Smart ) to buy it rather buying online where you can see it with your own eyes for real ."
2,Was not what was advertised.,"I was looking for a bigger collar for my dog so he couldn't get to his foot. The dimensions that they listed on the site were much larger than what actually came, even though the sticker on the product said it was extra large. also it did not look like the picture. It did not have the nice rubber on the outside rim. It was wavy on the rim which made even more spots the dog could get past. When I tald the company about the issues they said I could return it for a refund but considering I paid $10 for the product and $5 for shipping I didn't think it would be worth sipping it back for another $5 just to break even maybe."
2,Was missing pieces and packed horribly.,"This item came in a box that was about 4 foot long, and 2 feet wide and tall. All they had to do was roll it up and it would have fit in a box a fraction that size. That was so wastefull and thoughtless. It was also missing two of the 4 connecters. I looked all through the box and they were not in there. Had space for 3 connectors on the edge and another as a backup I guess. Anyway, two of the three active connectors were missing. The backup one was there and I had another collar that was worn out that I was able to use the connectors so wasn't worth the time to hassle with replacements. Was not a good buying experience."
1,Cone way too short,"Seller delivery was very fast and quick, however the cone is way, way too short. The large size is so short that it is essentially useless since it does not keep the dog from reaching any part of his/her body. I tried for over a week to get it to work and finally gave up - it really is a bad design. The velcro closes the cone securely but my dog definitely did not like the ripping noise - quality snaps would have been much better. I cannot recommend this product since it did not come close to achieving it's designed purpose. Buying this was a mistake."
2,XL large is more like medium,"This E-collar is very cheaply made and the size is NOT extra large, it is a medium. I have a Weimaraner and the cone was small on him. This might be a product made for small dogs and toy breeds."
3,Does what its suppose to,"It does what it is suppose to, stop my dog from picking at her stitches. I bought two different types of E-collars, this one and the Kong Cloud. I prefered the Kong Cloud over the classic E-collar, so did my dog."
4,e-collar for my cat,I got the collar for my cat who has ear problems. The collar has worked great for keeping him from getting at his ears and they are finally healing. He hated the collar at the beginning but has adjusted to it. The adjustable clips are geat they keep it sucured and my cat has only escaped it once. The padded end help from keeping his neck from any sores but he has lost his fur around his neck. If you have need for a collar then i would suggest this one its flexible and well made easy to clean and does what it should
3,Medium sized is NOT large enough for Miniature Schnauzers,Our Miniature Schnauzers are between 19-23 pounds and the medium sized is NOT large enough at all. The dogs nose needs to be within the cone to prevent licking. These aren't that sturdy either. I recommend clear cones from the vets.
2,Could be better...,"I'm sure this collar works just fine, but there is no information about the actual size. I had no idea if I was buying a small for a regular size cat or small dog, or if it was for small cats/kittens or puppies... Turns out small is too small for my small cat."
4,Know your sizes!,The quality on this collar is very high. However-the size L that I purchased was closer to a medium-or maybe a small! It's not 'tall' or deep enough to prevent our Golden from getting at the sore on his back. The previous size L from Petco are much deeper and sized more appropriately.
2,Definitely not clear,"This collar is not clear enough for the dog to see through. Our poor Golden was running into everything. We finally decided to cut some of it off to give him more peripheral vision. Since we were trying to keep him from scratching a hot spot on the side of his head, it worked fine. My advice would be to try and find a collar that is truly see-through."
4,Great product,"Sturdy, light, does the trick. My dog could do without the loud 'SNAP!' when the poppers are being closed but, he's afraid of a lot."
2,Didn't last long,"After only 2 months, this collar is now in pieces. My 12 yr Rottweiler could also reach her sore on her leg while wearing it. So like other reviews stated, we too found that the Extra Large wasn't large enough to accommodate a large dog. I'm disappointed that it cracked and fell apart after such a short time."
3,dog e-collar,"Very happy with shipping--arrived quickly and very good packaging. The e-collar ran smaller than expected--ordered a L expecting 16"" but was 12-14"" instead. Our dog is a black lab/chihuahua mix--has lab body with very short legs and about 14-15""neck. The collar has to be closed on last set of holes so is very hard to get on. He needed it right away for health problem so used anyway since time to return for new one would have taken too long. Once on, the collar does prevent him from licking his sore leg so does what we needed."
1,Impossible to Use!,This collar is next to impossible to use. The clips are extremely difficult to attach/detach and I returned mine. Vet One makes a much better easier to use collar and I will go back to that brand.Buyer Beware!
3,"Small collar, sticky label.","It's a pretty small collar, even for cats, particularly for extremely bushy ones. One major annoyance though was the stupid label they put on the thing, it's takes up a vast amount of the cone and is difficult to remove, leaving a sticky residue that you have to use something to get off."
1,Not interested.,"This is an unbearable, boring book for the average reader. Unless you are interested in every second of Julia Child's life, don't bother."
4,So far the book is good,So far the book is good and very detailed. Lots of history on Julia's family.
2,This story deserves an editor,"I bought this book so I could learn more about Julia Child, a person I admire greatly. While plenty of details about her life are presented here, they're thrown together in a manner unworthy of this hardworking, detail-oriented woman.I was surprised and disappointed to find this book so poorly edited. Not only does the content lack cohesion, but there are actual typographical errors. For example, early in the text, the author makes a reference to the young Julia's twinkly, mischievous character: she calls this Julia's ""twinkle"" (with quotes), but the text reads ""twinkle,"" -- with quotes and a comma inside the quotes -- which any editor should have spotted.I'm not a writer, but I'm an avid reader and it's this kind of sloppiness which makes me lose faith in the author and turns me off to his/her book.I still have lots of faith in Julia Child, though."
3,New Yorker Magazine Review,"I refer potential purchasers to the New Yorker magazine's book review written by Jason Epstein (13 October issue). It is of course only one man's view, but if the author shares none of his subject's passion for food, I'll pass."
3,I wish it were better,"As a fan of Julia Child, I looked forward to reading her biography. She was a remarkable woman, who had a very interesting life, driven by her larger-than-life personality. Reading her life story should be a fascinating experience.This book, however, is not well-written. The facts are all there -- sometimes to a fault. But they are written very much like a high school term paper...lots of facts strung together by a few connecting words. I found myself very interested in the material, but reading it was too much of a slog! The only thing that kept me going was a true interest in the subject.If you're interested in getting a full picture of the life of Julia Child, you can't beat the information contained in this book. But I'd love to see someone take the information contained here (the author certainly did her research!) and present it in a way that's more enjoyable to read."
2,Julia Unleashed,"After seeing the recent movie about Julia & Julie, I wanted to delve more into the person behind the famous name. ""Appetite for Life"" seemed the natural choice. This thick volumed prove more is not necessarily better.Very little ever written about Julia has escaped the pages of this book. An apparent story line is absent.Although the volume overflows, chockablock full of Julia facts, personally, I would have preferred a more edited, more cohesive biography.If you want to know everything about Julia Child and have the time to wade through the author's indulgence of time, then this book has met its objective. Perhaps, it's only me, but I perceived Julia Child as someone who edited her words, aimed for perfection and accomplished both with style & grace."
5,The Real Julia,Julia was a fascinating woman. I never realized what she went through to finally be able to write her 1st cookbook and have her own TV show. It made me look at her in an entirely different light. Neat lady.
5,Cook Book Collector,"I have been a fan of Julia Child for many years. I watched her PBS series when it was first aired. I have many of her cookbooks. My best friend gave me her"" Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" ('81 edition) for my birthday many years ago. I was truly disappointed in the writing and organization of this biography. I much liked the later stories of her life in France that her nephew, Paul Prudhome, wrote with her. The latest book of her correspondence with Avis De Voto, All From One Kitchen Knife, is a true gem-worth every penny.I suggest someone who can truly capture the spirit and style of Julia tackle a true biography of her."
5,detailed and informative,This book is very informative and paints a thorough and delightful image of Julia's life.
3,Carelessness,"I'm only on page 30 of this biography, and I've already found a number of small, but annoying errors--annoying to me because I live within five miles of Pasadena, California, where Julia Child grew up. For example: Fitch writes of the ""snow-capped San Gabriel Mountains."" They are almost never capped with snow. She misspells Fremont Street as Freemont. She says that Neighborhood Church no longer exists. It does. All that leads me to believe that I will surely find other mistakes that reflect a lack of thorough research. Also, Fitch's style is somewhat disjointed, with a certain lack of cohesiveness. I will, nevertheless, probably read the book to the end because Julia Child somehow manages to shine through the sometimes sloppy writing."
4,VERY DETAILED!,"This is a BIG book crammed with information. I have been reading alot about Julia Child lately, but this is probably the LAST one I will have to read. The author has the book sectioned in readable sections within each chapter, so picking up where you left off is easy. There are actual quotes from the author's interviews with friends and family. Julia's husband Paul's thoughts are documented also especially through the letters to his twin brother. As we approach the anniversary of her 100th birthday, ""Appetite for Life"" is the definative work on Julia Child."
5,Epstein Misses The Point,"Noel Riley Fitch's biography of Julia Child introduces us to a very complex, interesting and compassionate woman. What we learn in the bio is that Julia's passion for living and learning has been life long. Epstein's bitter, angry review of the book in The New Yorker magazine completely misses the point. When I want to find out about Julia's passion for food, I simply open one of her cookbooks and read it."
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull","What a trudging, plodding, boring book! Tedious in detail,; mostly a recitation of names without any context of who they are and what makes them worthy of mention. Some cute photos, but otherwise not worth your time or money."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this album because I heard that Ozma was similar to Rooney and Weezer (bands I think are good). Ozma sure does have some similarities in this album (though they're probably more comparable to a Christian band like Reliant K), but that doesn't make the album any good. The whole album is very boring. There's just nothing special to it. I recommend that you pass on this."
1,Great book for Michael Moore fans,"In the first few chapters, a rich Republican asks the hero to kill his wife, a Republican politician induces a solitary orgasm while watching anti-abortion wackos throw fetuses at a 15-year-old girl, and (presumably) Republican businessmen refuse to tip their waitresses. I stopped reading after the narrator has a dream in which everyone in America turns into cockroaches the day after Ronald Reagan is elected. I've read and enjoyed many books where conservatives are cast as the villains, but this isn't a novel - it's a dehumanizing and contempt-filled screed. But that's just my reaction. If you enjoy books by Michael Moore or Al Franken (and many people do), you'll probably love this."
2,"Jewish, really?","I had high expectations for this one, but it has the same church dogma in it just Hebrew names used."
1,Complete con - unworthy of any stars,"There is nothing Jewish about this bible. It is a trick to make Jews buy it. The only Jewish bible is the Torah/ Tenach. T There are plenty of lapsed Christians, is it really necessary to publish the Christian scriptures in Hebrew with a wrapper suggesting that there is something Jewish about them? Why not go peddle them to the many lapsed Christians."
1,Psuedo-Judaism,"This review is not about who's right or wrong, it's about identity theft. The title of this book is misleading. In short, the Complete Jewish Bible is really a re-labeled Christian Bible with a Yiddish accent. If you want to read the Jewish Bible then I suggest the modern JPS version of the Tanakh (ASIN:0827603665). If you want to read the New Testament then I suggest the King James version. Christianity is not Judaism. Not one single Jewish organization, from Reform to Orthodox and everything in between, has accepted Stern's book as ""Kosher"". Only Evangelical Christians, Protestants and Messianics consider this book Jewish. Go figure."
1,"""The Complete Jewish Bible"" is Completely Misnamed!","The soi-disant ""Complete Jewish Bible"" is, in fact, a _Christian_ bible on which someone's done a cut-and-paste job, largely on the Nouveau Testament, replacing ""Jesus"" with ""Yeshua"", ""Matthew"" with ""Mattityahu"", etc.It has nothing, nil, nada, zip, zilch, to do with Judaism. It's a tool for so-called ""Messianic Jews"" to push their agenda."
1,Not really a Jewish bible,"This is not really a Jewish Bible, as it includes the New Testament. One suspects the hand of the Jews for Jesus movement here or other Messianic Jews. Real Jews do not accept Jesus as their messiah, as he does not fit the criteria of the prophets.If you're considering buying this as a bar/bat mitzvah gift, please look elsewhere."
1,Rubbish,"This book was written by one person who calls himself a Messianic Jew. No such thing. A Jew cannot be a Christian.This new clandestine method of converting Jews by tacking the name Jew onto a Christian religious group is hypocritical. I guess it's better than forcing us or killing us, but no part of the NT has anything to do with Judaism .... Their new self published ""Complete Jewish Bible"" not only contains the Christian NT but the single author had the audacity to include spoken Yiddish in the NT!!! For those who aren't familiar with Yiddish ... (Yiddish is a type of hybrid Hebrew and German) eventually spoken by most European Jews beginning around the 10th century CE. The author explains he put it in his first century NT to make Jews feel more comfortable .... any lie to get a Jew...."
3,Great and true,"This is a great translation and especially wonderful for Messianic believers. There is however one snag for the Kindle reader, and that is that it is not easy to navigate- it only takes you to the book, and not to chapters and verses."
5,great read,"great translation of the scriptures using the right names of God where applicable including God, El, El Shaddai, Elohim, Adonai, etc. Yeshua and using original Hebrew names. Great read and awesome price"
5,Wonderful,This version of the bible is so easy to understand. And the explanations of the hebrew words gives it a more personal feel.
5,Jewish girl really likes it-,"I have used this exclusively for eight years now. I have tried other ""hebrew friendly"" Bibles and for me they just aren't as good. There is a glossary in the back for beginners. All around, it's Yofi (wonderful)! I have even tried reading this one alongside ""English Traditional"" Bibles; like NIV, NKJV, KJV, & NASB, and it seems like the CJB (Complete Jewish Bible) conveys more accurately the thought of the day that it was written in. I am very happy with it. I would suggest the ""Jewish New Testament Commentary"" to go along with it."
3,Complete Jewish Bible. Just not sure yet.,"After 55 years of reading the KJV I'm having a difficult time getting into the Complete Jewish Bible. It was my intent to do my yearly Through the Bible Reading in this bible in 2012. It is a hard read for me. That may be due to my age, over 70, or my years of reading the KJV. I'm sure it was worth the investment, but not what I had hoped it would be. ( Not really sure what that was.)"
3,Bible perfect...Cover very thin,"The Bible is perfect, however the bonded leather cover is so paper thin I don't know how long it will hold up. Right now the Complete Jewish Bible is only made with glued bindings and bonded leather. I'm still looking for the better thicker bonded leather. I have friends who have the better binding. Hopefully soon they will make it with a sewn binding and genuine leather.I returned the product to amazon, yes, definitely buy from them again."
5,Hebrew roots translation,This translation is invaluable for giving one an understanding of the Hebrew roots of our faith and the concept of trust in God.
1,Actually Christian Bible disguised to catch unwary Jews,"Sadly this is another example of Christianity being packaged as Jewish to unsuspecting uneducated Jews. The New Testament is of course the Christian Bible.V'Da Mah SheTashiv: Know What To Answer (To Missionaries A Thorough Jewish response To MissionariesI recommend the Book I just inserted in this link instead for a btter ""education"""
1,Misleading,"This book is not a study of Judaism. It is a fine book if you want to learn some things about the Jewish roots of Christianity, but it is not the Jewish Bible."
1,Misleading...,"I was raised Anglican and am reasonable familiar with both the Old and New Testaments. I have a lot of sympathy with the Jewish reviewers of this book. I think it has been called ""The complete Jewish Bible"" to try and trick unsuspecting Jews, rather than respecting their rights to their own faith and their own ""complete"" Bible, the Tanakh (or Old Testament)."
4,Good bible version,A good version of the bible to have. It is put in our everyday English so it is easily understood.
3,Complete Jewish Bible: An English Version of the Tanakh......,"Somewhat misleading since the term ""Complete..."" is not from the Jewish perspective. I'm wondering how the Jewish community rates this book. In this respect, I reserve ""complete"" (pun on title) comments until I have seen reviews; to my knowledge, the Jewish community, as I know it, would dispute the concept since this book is based on the Christian concept that Jesus IS the ""Messiah"" = Christ. I have barely perused the introduction, which honestly DOES point this out. How this affects the translation, I don't know since I haven't read that much about it, nor from it. I also THOUGHT (not pointed out in reviews) it might give more commentary on both B'riths = (Testaments). I still reserve further comments until a few months later.(Rev.)Paul R. Frerking"
5,A must for a serious follower of Christ,"This bible has been translated with the Jewish culture and language nuances at its heart. Jesus was Jewish, and ,lived in a Jewish environment, so to fully understand much of what he said and did, you HAVE to understand the context. This bible clearly shows this context in an easy reading format. Some Jewish words are used to underscore this context, but are easy to understand and help the reader to feel immersed in the culture that Jesus dwelt in.I don't use any other bible version now.Thoroughly recommend it."
4,Love it!,My only real problem with it is that it doesn't have one of the string book markers. Honestly I'd love about 4 of them in every bible I own...
4,Complete Jewish Bible,"This Bible is awesome! Shipping was quick and efficient, but I would have liked to know that the pages were not smooth like an original Bible. They were paper like and kind of rough."
3,"5 stars for hard copy, 1 for kindle edition","I first got this Bible in the hard-backed addition and I loved it. Since no translation is perfect, reading a verity of translations is helpful if you cannot read the original texts. I recently moved to Israel and had to leave most of my library in the States, so I decided to get the Kindle addition of the book. As another reviewer said, there is no navigational links for with specific books. After selection the book you want, you just have to turn pages to find the chapter. If you want the first chapter, this is no big deal, after that it gets very tricky since the chapter numbers are about 1 font size larger than the verse numbers, and it is easy to miss where the next chapter starts. I would live to see a practical version of the Complete Jewish Bible available for the Kindle, but at the moment, it needs a lot of work."
2,navigating is not easy,"I have this book in hard copy & it is my 'regular' Bible, so I was eager to get this on my Kindle for ease in transport. However, I have to say I am extremely disappointed not to be able to ""Go To' any scripture by simply typing it in, or for that matter, even accessing each Parashah. I hope that this is something that will be rectified in the future."
4,Finally,"I am so pleased to finally have the CJB in Kindle format. I am pleased that the lay out is the same as in the printed version (divided by parashot, etc). However, I wish the publisher would format it so that you have the ability to jump between parashot using the table of contents. Currently, you have to go to the book and then page forward until you get to your location, or just enter a word to search, where it will give you every occurrence of the word. You cannot use the 'Go to' function to go to a specific page. However, I am pleased to have this in digital version."
2,Disappointed,"I was excitied when I first discovered that this wonderful version of the Bible was available as an ebook - have been looking for this one. However when I downloaded it, I discovered that one could only navigate by books, and not chapters. Fine for reading through, but not for working with. Hope this will be offered again with improved navigation."
3,It's a Trap! This David Stern is not the commissioner of the NBA.,"Of course this work is a syncretic trap. Allow us a brief survey of the facts. The author is a self-proclaiming Jew that believes Jesus is/was the Jewish Messiah. The author spent his better years immersed in secular subjects (at the highest level) and not in traditional Jewish sources. The question about Jesus was settled amongst Jews about 2000 years ago. Why did the majority of Jews that lived in the pre-Christian era, both educated and lay, reject Jesus? During the Second Temple Period, educated Jews didn't want any part of his heretical ways or teachings. The cult of Jesus was manhandled by the bloodthirsty Romans and merged with Greco-Roman paganism. Torah Jews continued following the Word of God and they faced the added persecution from this new religion/cult. Jews settled the question of Jesus thousands of years ago. Therefore I must ask you the reader, does this translation belong on the shelves of the Flat Earth Society?"
3,If only it were bound better,I really want to like this bible but mine is falling apart and I have not owned it for long.
1,bad idea,"Im always looking for a Bible with better translations, but this one was not for me. When they use Hebrew words they are not spelled right it just makes it confusing if your breaking down the scripture, looking at the root meaning of words... In my opinion, worst bible ive had so far. I would get a KJV or NIV before this. Or you can do what i did, get the interlinear bible with strongs concordance. Then all you need is the rest of the texts(scripture-the lost books). With these tools you will be able to see the true word, not the doctrine of men if the most high wills it..."
3,CJB,"Product arrived a day late with a large ugly white sticker on the back. It was a gift. After 15 minutes of trying to remove the sticker it finally came off, had to use alcohol wipes as well, on a leather cover. Other than that, all was as promised."
3,Can't Navigate,"I love the Complete Jewish Bible...I have a hard bound copy so I thought it would be great to have on my iPad. However, even though I can go to a book in this version, I can't navigate within a book to a specific chapter and verse. It is impossible to get to a specific text in a short time."
4,Complete Jewish Bible,"This Jewish Bible in English is good, the only thing I have against it is that the names in it are in Jewish and it hinders me in reading it as I cannot pronounce the names correctly. I would have liked the names to also have been in English."
2,"GREAT Translation, but not-so-great electronic format","I absolutely love the translation, but the formatting leaves a lot to be desired. You can only access the table of contents, which links to each book, but not to each chapter within the book. This is difficult when trying to pinpoint a specific section as some books (like Psalms!) require flipping through a LOT of individual pages one by one to reach the desired section. A paper copy is actually better because you can get to specific places more quickly. This was so disappointing, but my only issue with the book."
1,Horrible translation of the Greek,"While Dr. Stern's grasp of the Hebrew is erudite and developed, his translation of the Greek text is horrible at best, and at worst, arguably heretical. I am a NT scholar and his translation of the B'Rit Hadashah is irresponsible. To have one man translate scripture as opposed to a committee is always an exercise in folly and this is a perfect example of reckless scholarship."
1,Shameful,As an Orthodox Rabbi let me say that this is a shameful hoax - Judaism and the new testament are mutually exclusive. This is a trick on behalf of missionaries to lure Jews into their ranks. Be forewarned.
1,"The author is a liar by entitling this book ""Jewish"" when it is the Christian Bible !","The author is a liar by entitling this book ""Jewish"" when it is the Christian Bible.The cult ""Jew for Jesus"" of which this author belongs lies in order to attain ignorant Jews as adherents."
1,"""Jewish"" Bible?",This book is not a Jewish Bible like it claims to be. It is a Christian Bible. The title of this book is very offensive to Jewish people. If you want an actual Jewish Bible I recommend Artscroll's Tanach.
5,My Expectations,"The Complete Jewish Bible is a very good text to include in ones's library. It is more of a paraphrase than a literal word for word translation and its strength is that it gives one an understanding of the Hebraic mindset when reading the text. I find this to be very useful when studying.I was disappointed, however, as I thought I was receiving a later printing than what I did receive. Other than that, the Complete Jewish Bible is all it is supposed to be; presented from a Hebraic perspective to give the student a better understanding of the written word. The introduction alone is worth the price of the book. David Stern did an outstanding work. Check out the Jewish Commentary on the New Testament as well by Dr. Stern."
4,Complete Jewish Bible - OE,Good quality - paper is a little different and a few pages misssed the cut. Arrived in good time.
5,A Commentary on The Jewish Bible,"This is a wonderful english version of the Bible as Old and New Testaments are presented.The words are incredible.First I read familiar passages then I read from my NIV. It lacked. I must hasten to add however, that the Jewish Bible does not add content."
3,better than some others....,"Well, as we know there are too many different Bible's that came out by the adversary to trick us. That's the reason i say it's better than others if you wanna learn a little modern Hebrew at least the terms and some names and it;s an understandable english however, still there is pagan words here and there and i heard the name Yeshua is what Messianic Jews made up from Aramaic and the Real Name is still being debated...??? also there is two form of Eli why have you forsaken me ? And Elohi why have you forsaken me ? so which one are we to use when we're calling Him not just a god but Elohi instead ? And i heard it's not how it spelt it's Alahy? Alahi ? just gets too confusing sometimes that's all not too much against the book i like that the english in there is modern as long as it's translated from the earliest sources of Hebrew i would not mind..."
3,First user? And quality of packaging and transport.,Some pages had marks of previous use. Also the book had damages/scratches due to impacts during transportation due to lack of packaging/rough handling. I decided to keep the product but I will be more reluctant to use amazone again...The content is as expected though.
5,Excellent Translation,"I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to new christians who have never read the bible before. This is a wonderful book for people who are well acquainted with biblical concepts.(For new believers, I recommend The New International Version[NIV] or the New Living Translation[NLT]). This definitely takes your knowledge of the bible to a deeper level. This bible uses many Hebrew words-with a transliteration in the context of the verses, and a translation in the glossary. The editor carefully chose which words to translate into Hebrew, words that carried great significance. Once the original Hebrew was explained it shed new light on events in the bible. There were some things I had been confused about in the bible before I read this translation. Reading this was like discovering the missing pieces to a puzzle."
4,Great easy-to-read English translation,"This translation is both easy to read and user-friendly. Especially referring to the Tanach, this is a modern language paraphrase (and several revisions) of the old JPS version, complete with clearly marked parashat (including the subdivisions within a parsha) and haftarah readings. This is the best translation of Tanach I have ever owned. Whether you like Dr. Stern's JNT added to this translation or not, I recommend you to get a copy of this, regardless of your convictions."
1,Not what I expected,"I was very excited to get my new Bible in, and then was disappointed. For starters, I was looking forward to reading this version and understanding God the way His chosen people (the Jews) did. Unfortunatly, it does use a lot of Jewish language in the text, but there are no footnotes or explanations in parenthesis; you are I guess supposed to just understand it. Also, the books of the Bible are arranged differently than in a standard Bible, which makes navigating it difficult. I will sadly, be returning this. Also, my copy came damaged from Amazon; some of the gold on the cover was rubbed off."
3,Jewish Bible,"I have a hard copy of a Jewish Bible, this download is good but not as good as expected. Its one authors translation,"
1,This is **NOT** a Jewish Bible.,"To those looking for a legitimate source for a Jewish Bible, this is not the place to look. From the outside, this may look like any other Jewish Holy-Book. Yet, what is revealed inside is anything but a thinly veiled attempt to convert Jews through what is known as the lifeblood of Judaism, The Torah.If one is truly looking for insight about the Tanakh (The Hebrew name for the entire Jewish bible), please check out the Artscroll Tanakh. This is one of the most thorough Jewish bibles out there, and it contains both Hebrew and English. This is not a Jewish bible, and nor is the author of it a practicing Jew."
5,THis is,David Stern does a wonderful job of making the New Covenant come alive. He shows us the actual writings of the new testament writers and their literal writings from the Hebrew. Everyone should add this book to their library.
1,This book is insulting,"The fundamental flaw in this book can be seen in the title. There is no Jewish new testament. The Jewish bible is the Tanakh. ""Testament"" itself is a Christian term. If you believe that Jesus or Yeshu or whoever is the messiah you might be many things but you would not be Jewish. Unfortunately, you cannot have your matzot and eat it too."
1,Don't be deceived,This is not the Jewish bible. This is a Christian bible which is not the same thing. The title is intentionally deceptive. Dressing it up with Hebrew doesn't make it the Tanakh. Disgusting and dishonorable.
2,A MESSIANIC JEWISH CREATION,"I value Jesus as a prophet. I admire the creativity and devotion of a messianic jew creating a New Testament with an Old testament flavor though I do not agree with the perspective. History cannot be changed and the author's interpretation, while ambitious and interesting does no service for Christians or Jews, in my opinion. I'll stick with my NIV Holy Bible and Artscroll Stone Tanach continuing to reflect on the true books of the Judeo-Christian tradition."
3,Ok...but has problems.,"This translation is ok. It does a good job at restoring the actual Hebrew names to most of the people in the Scriptures. It is good for a quick read or devotional Bible. However, if you are wanting to get into some serious Bible study, this Bible has serious issues. The Tenakh (OT) is sloppy. Which is crazy because its mainy a reprint of the public domain JPS version. The Apostolic Scriptures (NT) is even more sloppy. There are even instances where Stern takes the ""Jewishness"" OUT of the NT instead of putting it back in. He lets his own theological biais translate many Hebrew idioms poorly. In many cases in his translation of the NT, he inserts commentary instead of a translation. This is a sloppy translation at best.So, again, this is a good Bible for quick devotions or if you are only into ""skimming the surface"" in your readings. If you want to get into serious Bible study...chuck this translation."
4,A Jewish slant on the whole bible,"Having first come across David Stern`s New Testament translation, I ordered the whole bible. The hard back edition makes it a firm but fairly heavy book to hold. I had expected the layout to be in two columns but I have found that I have soon got used to the lack of columns.The OT seems to have less additional notes than the NT versionbut nevertheless it is very useful to have the various Hebrew words, names and expressions included in the text.I also usually find the personal translation very helpful and insightful. It is good to use in parallel and in conjunction with other translations as well as an authority in its own right.All in all I am pleased with my purchase and look forward to reading the NT Commentary in due course"
3,Best bible but not happy with electronic format,"This is the best bible, especially if you are a Messianic believer. I have carpal tunnel, so trying to hold my big, heavy hard copy was very tiresome and painful, so I was so very happy when they finally came out with an electronic verson of the CJB.My only complaint is the table of contents format. This one only takes you to the main table o contents, and to the books of the Bible, with no breakdown of chapters. So, if I want to go to Psalm 119, v 55, I have to go to table of contents, go to Psalms, then scroll thru all the pages until I get to Psalm 119. Very tiresome."
1,Disappointed,"The book is so basic - no details. For example, you would think it would go into the details of insurance - what the difference is between bonding and liability insurance and advise you as to which you need, and where to go for this, and how much to expect it to cost. Instead the book only says, ""This Insurance is important protection"" and will ""offset the costs of major damages"". Same with Licenses. It tells you that you need one - offers no advice as to how to go about getting one, if there are fees, etc. - zero details at all. I was very disappointed in this book."
1,Can't expect much for the price.,"There is a myriad of similar information on operating a house cleaning business. About 99% of what's out there is pretty basic stuff. But, for the price, you really shouldn't expect much, either. The trouble is, like another review touched on, insufficient information is almost as dangerous as having none. If you are serious about starting or growing a substantial, successful and highly profitable residential cleaning service, visit [...]. It's a larger investment, but the information and business principles it teaches will pay for itself in both time and money saved many, many times over."
4,excellent,"well well this cd is quite good. some really nice trance, and some alright house. the mixing on the cd isn't so great, but then again you don't get this cd for it's mixing, but rather because of it's selection of traxx. and let me tell you, the track selection is very nice :) especially the beginning 3 traxx and the last 4 traxx. i just wish all global underground's were this good :)"
2,Dreadfully Boring!,"I know Thoreau is an American classic, but his journals are tedious and boring. If you are a huge fan of Thoreau AND you love to read about all the details of someone's daily walk - the types of vegetation to be found, etc. With only a very occasional musing into the workings of human relations, this book is for you."
3,As lousy as this movie is-,-it scared the crap outta me as a kid when Dr. Shock aired it in the 70s (WPHL - Philadelphia). I miss that show. :(
1,Worst Dracula vs. Frankenstein movie EVER!,"Dracula vs. Frankenstein. Hmmm. I don't know for sure, but I would guess that somewhere in the history of cinema there must have been at LEAST one other film that pitted these two iconic movie monsters against each other. Perhaps there's some well-respected classic out there I've just never heard of. Or maybe they met in some long-forgotten piece of cinematic garbage--some low budget quickie that featured terrible acting, with dialogue so incredibly dull that it would leave anyone who viewed it, including half-wits, clawing at their skulls in agony. I don't know if there is such a movie. I wish I did. But this I do know: if any such film exists, it HAS to be better than this one."
1,Monster Mush,"""Dracula vs. Frankenstein"" (1971) is straight from the gutter. You may want to take a shower after watching this Z-grade nightmare. It's painful to see Lon Chaney Jr. and J. Carrol Naish exploited in such a sleazy manner. Directed by the infamous schlockmeister Al Adamson, who further humiliated an ailing Chaney in ""The Female Bunch."" No redeeming value whatsoever."
2,so bad I had to have it,"Wow..what a piece of garbage this is...I remember seeing this film on a Saturday afternoon when I was a kid and thinking then that it was a bad movie. But it's one of those films that is one laughably bad scene after another, from the baked potato Frankenstein monster to Dracula's 70's rock makeup and crackerjack magic ring complete with crappy animation. And for all of those reasons, I just had to buy a copy."
1,So Bad Its good,"This Movie is just awfull. J. Carrol Naish, Lon Chaney, Forrst J. Ackerman, Dracula, Frankenstien.It was made by enjecting scenes with Dracula and Frankenstein into a unwatchable movie called ""Blood Freaks"". It was really bad.I place it in my collection with ""Bride of the Monster"", ""Robot Monster"" and ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Broklyn Gorilla"" as a classic piece of junk. It is no ""Spider Baby"" or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" but is a step up from ""Santa Claus Versus the Martians""."
3,They just don't make them like they use to.,Dracula vs. Frankenstein is nothin like the old classics from universal studios.Lon chaney jr. did great in the old B-horror movies.They just don't make them like they use to.
3,It seems they have it confused with another movie...,"This version of Dracula VS Frankenstein is not to be confused with the 1971 J. Carroll Nash version with Lon Chaney. The other reviews on this page have it wrong! This version, starring Michael (the day the earth stood still) Rennie and The european wolfman Paul Naschey has space aliens trying to take over the world by resurrecting the planets most horrifying monsters, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and the mummy. Once alive the plan is to break earthman's will and conquer the planet. The acting is certainly very poor (except for the great Paul Naschey a.k.a Valdimar Daninsky a.k.a the Wolf Man) and the make-up on frankenstein looks like a child did it. It does have that campy , cheesy feel about it and those who are fans of B horror will get their fill. As for the title though, i don't think that Dracula ever does fight Frankenstin!"
1,BOTTOM OF THE BARREL JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had a friend(who is no longer on my christmas card list) who told me that this was just great and very funny. WRONG!!!!!!!!!! This is the pits and very sad to see many old time actors (Lon Chaney Jr, and J.Carol Nash, both in their last roles) trash themselves in this trash that isn't even as good or as funny as ""Billy The Kid Vs Dracula""!!!!!! The worst and not worth getting if it were free."
1,Way Too SMALL For Any Man,This watch is WAY TOO Small for any man. Is this a children's watch??? I bought this to give to my Best Man at my wedding and now I'm out of time. I'm very disappointed in Bulova and Amazon!
5,Out of the Ordinary,It's nice to see a movie with such great characters. Beautifully directed and a fun ride!
5,Wonderful movie,"This movie is very clever and fun. Just about anyone would enjoy watching it. I don't know why it wasn't that popular, it was really good! That is why I give it 5 stars!!!"
2,sean patrick flannery i love him.... BUT,So there i was surfing the net... listening to suicide kings in the background.... thinking... okay so i just won the Young Indian Jones trading card set... what ELSE should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it! A HA! here we go... a movie with BRITNEY MURPHY as well- SCORE! Well... i was sadly sadly... very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly.... if you like quirky black comedies... this movie is for you... but not for me! Sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton... britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she doesn't want to marry him.... it all just sucked... sean though... is still of course sexy sexy! and so is brtney murphy- but i think she looks better as a thin blond.. than a baby fat brunette....
2,Not much Jane,"If your a Thomas Jane fan and trying to see all of his works I just want you to know he is only in this odd movie at the beginning for only about 10 minutes and it is a distrubing suicide scene and funeral scene. The rest of the movie is a dark comedy with some laughs, but overall depressing. You really have to like the main actors to like this movie. Would not recommend for young audiences."
5,Rickie Lee Jones reinvents herself ..inspiring and moving..,"This woman has done a metamorphosis and has become another kind of beautiful butterfly...she is in the best voice I've ever heard - strong, clear, dynamic. The music is entrancing, the ideas unforgetable. As for the obviously unstable, angry B_D@msn....Hey Buddy! You repeat things you don't know? You hear she can hardly stand onstage? What? No, you misunderstood... She knocks the audience off of their feet! Your low brow remarks say it all, so we won't suggest you find out first hand. Back to Ms. Jones... Oh my god! I thought I knew her - her style, her way. Here she is..entirely different; it's exciting! With all the familiar genius, grace, inspiration - and what a voice! A true artist and musician, she makes musicians want to write;to play! She inspires people to become musicians... That's important. Rickie Lee Jones is transcendent."
5,Listen to every record Rickie Lee Jones has ever recorded,"You will soon learn, if you don't know by now, that Rickie Lee Jones is a genius. She is a national treasure in the making."
1,O.K. Enough is enough!,"This woman has done WAY too many drugs. What really ticks me off about Rickie Lee Jones is that she's a fake ... one of these self-appointed ""artists"" now claim they were ""victims"" of the early commercial success ... and now she thinks we are going to respect her because she wants to jump on the trip hop bandwagon and try to win our respect back? Forget it! This woman should be ashamed of herself. Here's yet another pathetic old washed up rock star/junkie trying to be hip again ... and I hear she can barely stand at concerts and she falls off the stage ... sad story, man"
4,Great music but two edits were ill advised!,"Bob James music has been a major soundtrack for my life since 1974 (and Earl Klugh 1977) replacing the Beatles(rock)of my adolescence as a major influence! The compilation as a whole is excellent but I was really disappointed by the edits of ""Kari"" and ""Feel Like Making Love"". Anyone not familiar with Bob James' music probably wouldn't notice a thing and still enjoy these tracks. The only thing I could relate this to in some manner, is like hearing the ""Top 40"" version of ""Light my Fire"" by the Door's or ""Oye Como Va"" by Santana versus the longer versions on the albums.The edit of ""Kari"" trucates Earl Klugh's ""gorgeous"" acoustic guitar solo and the edit of ""Feel like Making Love"" chops Bob James electric piano solo that defines so much of the style of his later work!"
1,Case Illogical would be a better name,"This item is being returned. Notice how the picture doesn't show any devices actually inside the case? What you can't tell from the photo is that this case has no depth to it whatsoever. It is a sleeve, essentially, with a front and back but no third dimension to allow anything to fit inside. Also, what looks in the photo like a flap, is actually stitched down and only open on the bottom edge. It works kind of like some pillow cases I've had, where the sides overlap. The problem is that the overlap is stitched down so tightly that you can't get a phone or camera inside. Even if you managed that, it would not be easy to remove. So then what's the point? This is not a case for something I want to use frequently. Don't buy it unless you need something to store very flat objects in that you will never need to remove from the case. I am out a few buck on this since I have to pay return shipping. An idiot must have designed this."
3,The EP itself actually is pretty standard,"""Standard Stuff for Drama"" is a collection of six tracks, five of them remixes of songs from the album POLYESTERDAY and one the track ""Polyesterday.""Although ""Polymovie,"" the version of ""Polyesterday"" mixed for the music video, is a fine, cinematic, atmospheric track, the other tracks don't quite stack up. ""Barry A/B"" and ""Gun Acid"" are two boring, monotonous techno remixes. ""Believe Underdog Instrumental"" is pretty boring and chaotic. ""Believe 16B (radio edit)"" is an okay remix, used by Sasha and John Digweed to good effect in NORTHERN EXPOSURE II: EAST COAST EDITION.All in all, it's ""Polymovie"" that makes this album recommendable, except for those who would buy it anyway for collection value. But certainly POLYDISTORTION and THIS IS NORMAL are the most important purchases by gusGus."
2,Try to Get Support,"I like the unit, but the headphones were defective when received and although they said they'd ship a replacement set (while aslo assuring me that any old set of headphones would work!), alas they never did ship the replacement. Then the light glasses broke and they informed me I could buy a new set for about $50...needless to say, not impressed with their support for their product and wouldn't purchase from them again."
1,Interesting device...,"but customer service of The MindPlace seems non-existent. It does not respond to my written requests, so one is on his or her own seeking help after the purchase: Caveat emptor. Perhaps Sirius light and sound machine was the best choice after all? That is my choice if I were to do it over."
3,proteus machine...not quite the answer,"I'm not an expert on entrainment but I'm beginning to suspect that products such as the proteus has taken a scientific concept a bit too far. I've tried this product and while I do believe that there is a certain amount of ""entrainment"" I question whether or not it has any long term advantages. I suspect that bombbarding the brain with one stimulation at one time does not have the same effect that meditation does in that during meditation it appears to me at least that different areas of the brain are being stimulated at different times and over time there is permanent changes. However, for someone who has no experience with what's going on in their own brain, this machine is not a bad way to begin to find out. Enjoy the journey."
1,Cheap chinese junk!,"I bought one of these a few years ago from another vendor for over $200. The supplied LED glasses broke while I was putting them on the first time. I bought two other sets of LED glasses (Red/Blue & Red/Green) at the same time and tried those. All was ok for a while. I didn't use it that often, about two dozen times over the period of a year and a half, and then one of the audio channels failed completely. The manufacturer's customer service dept. never responded to my emails even though I offered to pay for a repair. For the heck of it I opened the unit to see if I could diagnose the problem myself and found cheap no name IC chips that had absolutely no markings. In short, it's a piece of junk. It's definitely not worth the money I paid for it nor the price that's being offered here. I don't think I'd buy it for $30. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one."
3,Noise in my headphones,my mindplace proteus is well.i'm satisfacted .I'm just disappointed of a noise in the headphones. It's a little unpleasant.
2,"Not sure what I expected, but.....","I'm not sure what I expected, but I am dissapointed. Originally I purchased the unit only, and used it with my own hypnosis cd's and mp3's. I don't really get the visual effects, or the vibrating sound waves. I found myself more distracted that listening to them alone. The premium headphone are moderate at best, and I used my earbuds for better sound. Per a suggestion in a previous review I thought buying the corresponding CD set might improve the experience, there is only one of the 5 CD's that doesn't make me want to turn it off before it's done. Maybe I need to give it more time....but the cost is way to high to try another system like this. There must be something out there that will really help me ralax."
1,Not a biofeedback machine,This is a total ripoff. Mindplace has other equipment that may be used for biofeedback but Proteus is not one of them. There is no process for biofeedback in this machine. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this. I wonder how many of the other reviews are written by employees of Mindplace.
1,Severe side effects experienced,"I have chronic stomach issues and despite several tests and procedures done by my gastroenterologist, no direct cause has been identified. Have taken 2 other digestive enzyme products that caused no problems but were just not very effective, so I decided to try this.I took my first 2 of these tablets with a meal as per directions. Within an hour, I had significant stomach upset, burning pain in stomach, stomach distention and severe gas, all of which lasted for over 15 hours! I also had several bowel movements during the night. And the next morning, I woke up with a terrible headache! This stuff needs to come with a warning! My theory is that what set me off is the hydrochloric acid in this product as the other two products I had tried did not contain that. But I'm only guessing.User beware! You might want to start out with just 1 tablet and see how you feel."
4,Ultrazyme works great,This helps with my digestion along with other vitamins and I received these In great time. Will buy them again.
1,Didnt work,"I've been trying different products to my condition (Morning Diahrrea) and sorry to say, it didnt work for me"
5,"this is the version to get, man","This is the version to get. Light in the Attic gave this record the red carpet treatment: translated lyrics, interviews, remastering, and original packaging... damn, even the record label mimics the original Philips label! Amazing sonics, amazing music. Forget the other issues... get this one!"
4,Birth Order And You,"I really enjoyed this book and was very shocked to see how well it describes personalities according to their birth order. I felt as if someone had written about my life, under the appropriate headings describing my birth order. It is not all flattering, but simply accurate with most things. It is also a helpful tool in understanding and having successful relationships. Try it for yourself."
3,the price was right and the color looks ok.,the price was right and the color was really looks ok. if you are learning i guess is fine to tried
4,Great eye stress relievers,"I liked them so much I bought a second pair after I sat on my first pair. My sister in law liked them so much that I gave the second pair to her for X-mas and bought my third pair. The polarizing lenses are great eye stress relievers. Great for active outdoors, men or women."
4,"Great glasses, but not as big as others have said","I am a large guy (6'5"") who needs large glasses to fit my head. Other reviewers stated that the glasses were made for larger heads, but I find that the glasses could even be a little bit bigger and I would be 5star happy. The optical quality is great so I can live the the glasses being a bit smaller than I wish. I also wish that the plastic was a little heavier, I kind of feel like the glasses could break (but apparently they wont). I really like the case they come with, it is light and protects the glasses nicely."
5,Great Buy,I searched the web high and low looking for a pair of sunglasses to give to my husband for Christmas. These were a great buy at a great price. In addition he really likes them.
3,the man,As far as sight the glasses are wonderful..but they are a little small for my head..I will probably give them to my son..If you have a medium to large head I would not recommend them..Shipping was fast.. They are light weight and appear durabile...
3,Some things should not be purchased without trying.,"Those things include shoes and sunglasses. These sunglasses are obviously of a good quality; however, fit could be an issue and the lenses are on the small size. I had to return them. It is simply too risky to purchase this kind of an item without trying first."
2,Junkie glasses,"I bought a pair of this sunglasses at sunglasses warehouse,and less than a year later,the rubber around the frame on the nose area had just broken apart and fell off not buying this brand any more:0("
2,Poor quality.,"Bolle Polarized Recoil - Various Frames & Lens Colors!Purchased these last May. Since then a lens has popped out and refuses to reseat securely. I have been using Bolle sunglasses for the past 3 years as an reasonably priced alternative to other brands of polarized sunglasses. The first two pair were solid and have held up. But in the last two years quality issues such as detached temple and nose pads along with the frames not holding the lens in this pair of Bolle Recoils, leads me to believe it's time to look for a more reliable brand."
4,"Prescription: Rx8, to that this talks about, that the lenses have increase in the crystal thanks","to that Rx8 prescription talks about, that the lenses have increase in the crystal thanks"
1,Amazon service sucks!!!!!!!!!,I ordered thses glasses and they sent me the wrong ones. They sent out a new pair and they were still the wrong ones. The second pair someone took the correct lable and put it over the actual lable on the box but what was inside the box was not what I ordered. They told me not to reorder for 2 weeks. I had to waste my time to take the glasses back to the post office. I ended up keeping the second pair becasue it was not worth the hassel to take another trip to the post office. I thought I should have been compensated for my gas and time. Clearly it was their mistake not mine.
5,Good glasses,"I bought this glasses for my husband and he likes them. They look good, good design and, the polirized lens are very helpful while he drives because they reflect light so he can see perfectly clear."
3,"Average size, nice glasses","I actually bought these because of reviews that had said they where big and would fit me. They did not. They seemed very nive, but average size at best. Of course Amazon takes back no problems...."
5,Great resource for a quick review of Italian verb conjugations,"As a teacher of Italian for adults, who are quick and demanding learners, I know how important it is to have handy a quick review chart of Italian verb conjugations which can be very useful when you cannot remember the difference between the future endings and the conditional (they're so similar!) So it's nice to have this chart readily available to refresh my recollection of the tenses. Since we are not immersed in Italian, we need to do a lot of memorization of verb conjugations in order to master the differences in tenses. I need all the help I can get sometimes in order to remember all these tenses!"
2,Mary Lou,Difficult to read and follow - has all the right info but not organized in a user-friendly way.
3,Uhm,I don't notice any change in hunger or energy when I take this product. It's like I didn't take anything.
1,useless,it didnt work (and I was dieting).. and on top of that it made me feel really really sick ..too much caffeine.. for a moment I thought I was going to have a heart attack or a stroke.
4,Al Adamson strikes again,"This is another in a long line of films made by the late great Al Adamson. The story is about a scientist who transplants the brain of a dying leader of a foreign country into the body of his hulking mentally retarded helper. You get a lot of gory brain surgery footage and a really mixed up plot involving government cover up's, sadism, spies, torture, and chained women. The cast is very good it includes Kent Taylor, Regina Carroll (Al's Wife), John Bloom and Grant Williams.I happen to like Adamson's films a lot and this is really no better or worse than any of them. If you like verteran actors playing monsters and dress up, you'll like this film."
5,¡Excelente!,"Este disco es para la gente que le gusta la música de los Beatles, el rock de los años sesenta en general, el rock alternativo y la música latina. Moreno escribió todas las canciones excepto Babalú, su versión de una canción clásica, y todas son bien divertidas y diferentes. Creo que este talentoso músico va a tener mucho éxito en el futuro."
5,magnificent,"i have recently picked up a copy of Jorge Moreno's self titled debut album and all i can say is that it is magnificent.it is hard to believe that in the year 2002, yet a new genre of music has been invented. this entire album is refreshing and unique, especially when so many artists are stuck regurgitating the same-old-same-old.hats off to you, MORENO."
1,Not the Chilton I remember ...,"I've had Chilton's hardback manuals for 30+ years and have always relied on them for complete car care information. However, with this particular paperback manual I could not even find the basic engine specs such as oil pressure, oil capacity, and oil type. I expected to find this basic information in some sort of table, but had to flip through dozens of pages just to find a sentence about capacity. Still cannot find oil pressure information. Better to spend the extra bucks for a FSM from Jeep for everything you may want to know."
3,"Good Detail, But Not Very Complete",This Jeep manual appears to be rather old and hs not been updated. A number of chapter and section references appear to wrong.
3,Not QUITE....,"This kit shares the same problem as the original TV series tie-in model of the General. (No surprise... same mold.) It's the wrong type of Charger. You'd need to use the decals & a few detail parts of this kit along with the Revell/Monogram 68 Charger kit to make an accurate General. The R/M kit has the correct body style with the ""tunnel"" rear window."

5,Thank You,"Mr. Smith does a wonderful job of introducing the claim adjusting business within the larger insurance field. Items up for discussion range from job related risks to ideas for similar or related careers. For those who consider themselves in the preliminary career research stage, this is a fantastic first read. Not every question is going to be spelled out in black and white, but the adjusting business is all about putting the pieces together for yourselves!"
5,Great book,"So far I'm very pleased with the book. I'm new to this entire profession and really want to be a ""Storm Trooper"" as Gordon Smith puts it. He's been a very great teacher so far, I'm understanding what you need in order to begin the career and who my enemies are while doing my duties. I couldn't ask for a more blunt and experienced author!"
4,Good but a little outdated,"Gordon Smith puts it altogether in this book. The only detractors is it was published in 1998. If there is a more resent printing, get that one instead. Now for the good parts: Mr. Smith writes in an entertaining style that puts the reader at ease. He uses Insurance Adjuster language but in such a way as to be understandable. I haven't read the entire book yet, but will recommend this to anyone needing good material to start your Insurance Adjusting career. As an aside, I would like to meet Mr. Smith someday just for enlightenments sake."
2,"THE ADJUSTER, MAKING INSURANCE CLAIMS PAY","THIS BOOK IS STRICTLY FOR BEGINNERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE FOGGIEST IDEA HOW TO OPERATE A BUSINESS IN THE SIMPLIEST WAY. IF YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TYPE OF CLOTHES TO WEAR, HOW TO SET UP A DIARY SYSTEM, FINE. PERSONALLLY, I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK.IF YOU EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACTUAL ADJUSTING, ALMOST ANY OTHER BOOK WOULD HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
2,Ok for the price,"I'm glad I didn't pay much for the cd. LOVE kidneythieves, LOVE the song ""Zerospace"" so I figured I'd love this cd because it had a couple remixes of Zerospace.Must say i was disappointed. The remixes weren't that good,and the remixes have none of the lyrics. For the price I got my single but I wish I would have just bought the original Zerospace album."
4,Sams Review,"Dylan is on the moutain and all of a sudden the moutain eruppts. So he goes and finds his dad by this waterfall. But, Dylan can't do anthing because they are on top of Mount Saint Helens and Dylan won't be able to carry his farther all the way down the mountain. So a sasquach comes and carries his dad up to Buck's cabin. So Dylan lockis the trap door and hides the staff which is the secret key to open the trap door. So sasquach is carring Dylan's dad through the woods because when the mountain errupt he got knocked out and he had burns all over him from the top ash falling on his body. But, anyway the sasquach is carring his dad on the road in the woods and a helicopter comes and rescues Dylan and his dad but, the sasquach disappers."
4,the review of Sasquatch,"Dylan's dad is a housing agent, he rents out houses.He also was known around the house for his tinkering. Dylan's dad was out in the garage studing about the Sasquatch secertly. His family isn't that happy about his diads studing things because he usually brings a whole bunch of books and other things for research that isn't need into the house. Dylan's dad ends up going to far on the Sasquatch study this time though. To many people the Sasquatch is a myth but Dylan's dad found out that he was real when he went on a hunting trip with his friends from work. He has spotted the Sasquatch and stumbles back and gets knocked out. When he awakes he finds himself in a samll wooden hut that was recently built. This happening makes him twice as intrested so he joins a small group call the Big Foot Investagators (B.F.I.) He becomes really envolved in the group and ends up meeting the head leader, Clyde Smithers."
3,emilys book report,"This book is about a boy and his dad who go on a hunt for a Sasquatch. But while they are up there they discover a lot more then what they went up there for. The boy looks at the Sasquatch in a new when they leave the mountain. In my opinion this was okay because it was very adventurous and it keeps you on your toes, and it keeps you in suspense through out the entire book. I think that the book would be a good book for kids. I recommend this book to people who like adventure, to people who like books where you don't know whats coming next, but comes together in the end. I also recommend this book to kids because it is a little bit easier reading."
4,Sasquatch best read ever!,"What would you do if your dad was in a Sasquatch searching club? Would you go crazy? Well that's exactly what Jacob from the book Sasquatch has to deal with. Join Jacob and his scientist on a journey of a life time. But as you read further and further you get closer and closer to finding the great beast Sasquatch. In this journey Jacob will find out that his dad might not be so crazy after all as they find clues and artifacts that could lead them right to the monster. The book is the only one in the series. It's one of the best non-fiction books I've read with its incredible word choice and great set up. You could by this adventure for about 9.99 and it has about two hundred pages. I recommend this to anyone that likes mystery, suspense, and nonfiction but even if you don't like any of those I still recommend the book, it is a great read for all ages."
3,Burke,"Dylans father is always up to something strange, but when he starts to hear about all of the talk about sasquiath he becomes iterested in it. HIs father then joins a sasquath hunting team. The team palns to kill the sasquath to do research on it, but Dylans dad plans to stop it. Even though the mission is dangerous on the count of the search being around a active volcano. But when the search actually begins everybody doesnt get split up as planned. When Dylan finds himself alone with Buck in a saquaths tunnel things start to get really scary eapecially when the real thing is right in front of you.I find this book somewhat interesting to read. Its great for kids with imaginatoin. BUY IT!!!"
4,Sasquatch,"SasquatchSasquatch is an adventurous and very interesting book. This book has great descriptions and has kept me on the edge of my seat ever since I picked it up. This provides many mysteries about Mount St. Helens. It makes you want to get your travel pack together and start looking for him, too. If you have ever wondered about Sasquatches, this provides you with information. Mount St. Helens is about to erupt and the last living Sasquatches are is still living there. Small teams of survivalist are trying to save them. Will the team find the Sasquatch and, will they make it off the mountain if they do find them. If you like adventurous interesting reading this book is for you."
2,Good idea -- poor design,"This bib looks good in the picture but unfortunately the snaps that hold it in place will be too difficult for many elderly people to manipulate by themselves. An elderly adult with arthritis, tremors, other impaired small motor control, or dementia will likely need assistance to align the small metal snaps so that they close. A better design would have used velcro or some other method of securing the bib around the neck that would allow an impaired person to fasten the bib independently. The design of this product reflects an outdated mindset about adaptive clothing and suggests that the bib was designed for the convenience of the caregiver, not the convenience of the personal wearing it."
5,Priva Waterproof Mealtime Protector,These protectors are very good. They protect the clothing (chest and lap). I even reverse the protector to the waterproof side when necessary. They wash and dry well. Definitely recommended!
2,negative review,"plastic side stains, does not wipe off or wash out, looks sloppy even though it is clean."
5,Just What We Needed!,"This protector is great. Long long long. . . .however, I would like to see a ""catch all"" feature at the bottom for spills. The snap at the neckline is adjustable."
5,Great product,"I bought these bibs for my mother who has alzheimer's. They are waterproof, and cover the chest and lap. They wash well, and look nice. I'm very happy with this product."
1,Poor quality,"I contacted the manufacturer who states they have an ""unconditional guarantee"" about the stitching missing the fabric so that part of this is unsewn. No answer from them. So now I'm stuck with returning this to Amazon which is a pain...I don't see it now, but I do remember seeing that this product was supposed to be fastened around the neck with velcro which is what I wanted; well, they use snaps. And that's not as easy to use as velcro."
5,Mealtime protectors,I hightly recommend this item for anyone with difficulty eating. My husband has tremors and drops food and some times spills liquids. It is excellent protection for his clothes and easy to wash and dry.
3,For advanced learners,"I am at a low to intermediate level of knowledge of the Russian language. This book is far too complicated for me. It has an extraordinary amount of rules and exceptions to rules, which, for people who already know the language very well, may be quite useful; for me it is impossible to follow."
5,Most Affordable Oregon Scientific Wireless In/Outdoor Thermometer,"First off, I love Oregon Scientific products and have some more expensive models. This model is a terrific deal at $15. It works as well as the more expensive versions. The alarm clock was an unexpected bonus."
3,"Unit works great, remote sensor fails","I bought this on sale at Amazon so I am not complaining because it was a good deal. The problem though, is a major one. My remote sensor died after a few weeks of use. Even with new batteries, the unit won't pair with the base unit. A new remote unit costs $16-20 which is almost the cost of the product and twice as much as I paid for."
2,Freezing wake-up call,"The device actually works quite well, once you learn to shut off the HI/LO temperature alarm.WHAT IS ANNOYING is that you cannot shut off the alarm indicating freezing temp warning. A nice idea, but not at 2am or 4am. It continues to beep until you get up and reset it. It is even worse when the temperature hovers between 37.2 and 37.4 degrees, since as soon as it returns to 37.4 it alarms again - a total of 4 times before 6am the other night. This was even more of a problem during Autumn, when the temps would dip inconsistently. If I had the money to replace it, I would have torn out the batteries and thrown it away! I now have it placed on my nightstand for convenience."
2,"nice gadget, but has fatal annoying flaw","This device does the job, but it has a very annoying alarm function when it tries to warn of freezing conditions. There seems to be no way to turn it off. bleh!!!"
4,I like it.,"We like the ease of installation, the convenience of having indoor and outdoor temperatures and the extra bonus of the atomic clock setting itself.I have already had to replace batteries in both the indoor and outdoor units. This seems to be common among this type of device - I have had to do this with others like it.So, I recommend keeping your instructions. They are helpful for replacing batteries and resetting the unit."
4,a gadget worth having,"Really nice to sit at the dining table and know the inside, outside, and atomically correct time via an unobtrusive display. There are cons: The display cannot be seen except under ideal lighting and viewing angle, otherwise all you see is 88's. The user interface is unreasonably complex ... lots more buttons than anything like this needs, with unreadable labels. But if you don't mess with mins and maxs or multiple sensors, you can just struggle to get it set up and leave it be. I've only had this a couple of months so can't speak to reliability. My outdoor sensor is about 20' away through 2 walls and reception is strong."
3,OK But with a Serious Design Issue,"This is in most respects a nice unit. It's pleasant enough to look at and the numerals are legible. The radio-corrected time is a nice feature. But you should be aware of two issues: (1) The remote unit is battery powered and alkaline batteries freeze. You will have to use rather expensive lithium batteries in the remote unit during the months in which you have freezing temperatures. (2) The main unit warns you about this issue by beeping whenever the temperature goes into the range of 37-28 degrees F. If the main unit is in a sleeping area this will drive you crazy. There is no way to stop this except to open it up and cut the wire to the speaker. This disables the alarm for all purposes, but that didn't matter to me."
2,Too High,"This unit looks like a winner. It's seems to be heavy duty enough. The indoor temperature and the atomic clock are accurate, but the outdoor temperature is 10 degrees high...even at night.I guess I'll have to return it. The return process was fast and easy."
3,"Nice, but imprecise","This is a nice little unit with remote temperature sensor. My only complaint is that the remote reading can be off by up to 2.5 degrees (high or low). Oregon Scientific says that's within their margin of error, but I don't think a 5 degree swing is acceptable with modern equipment. If you can live with that amount of imprecision in the temperature read-out, this unit is fine; otherwise, look elsewhere. Although I don't know for sure, other Oregon Scientific equipment might similarly be inaccurate. A little tricky to set up, but the instructions are clear enough."
1,Don't waste your money!,Tiny screws to open in order to set. None provided - eyeglass repair kit needed. Instructions confusing - and it simply did not work as it should. When I called Oregon Scientific they determined it was not working and that most people had a problem with it including how hard it is to open.... And warned that all their thermometers were basically the same. Very Disappointing!
3,wow,I bought this item and I have had problems with temp readings. It is 45 degress f here and the main unit says it is 68 degrees f outside.The manual is very basic and lacks specifics. How do you place the sensor with full view of sky and also have it face the main unit indoors?I am rather disappointed with this one.
2,The outdoor humidity never registered and then quit altogether,"The atomic clock part was great and the display easy to see. The outdoor humidity reading never worked since we got it and then it quit working altogether. We tried to reset it, put in new batteries, etc. We finally had to return it. I wouldn't recommend this unit."
1,Not specified size,"I haven't used the product yet, but the dimensions stated by Amazon are incorrect. They say:Product Dimensions: 10.2 x 3.5 x 9.2 inchesIt isn't true. It is about 4"" x 3"" x 2"". It is just slightly bigger than the sensor is.Not at all what I thought I was getting.**EDIT** They have changed the dimensions on the description. For what it is, it works well."
2,Not so easy,"I'm still fighting to make the remote sensor operate. You set it, the reception unit shows the temperature, and after a few minutes, they lose the connection. and you have to start everething again, once the connection is out they don't retrieve it by themselves."
4,Tulip Bootie hurt my tootsies.,"I gave the boot 4 stars because I love the look of them. The purple stitching on the tan leather looks great. However, after wearing them for 4 hours, while running errands, my feet were screaming for my slippers. I think buying a gel pad for some cushion at the ball of my foot will inable me to wear them for a longer period of time. I wear a size 8 and they are true to size with a snug fit in the foot of the boot, but had no problems zipping them up with my slightly large ankles and lower calves."
5,Kenize Tulip Ankle Boot,I love these boots. The color is great and they are comfy for the height. I get a lot of compliments when I wear them.
4,Good,"I really like cruise ships so i thought I would enjoy this, and I did. It seems a little cheesy, I admit, a 12 yr. old afraid of water. Weird right? but it was a really good book. I couldn't put it down! The ending was a little weird though."
3,Dusty overcomes his fear of water with help from a ghost,"Dusty has a dreadful fear of water. This fear has led to a life of lying to cover up his fear. Yet, it is on a cruise, with his family, that Dusty comes face to face with his fear. His awakening comes through an Indian girl crying from the cabin next door. This is no ordinary girl, she is a ghost from the extinct Taino tribe. She enlists Dusty's help to return home and in the process teaches Dusty too overcome his fear of water. The author does a great job in telling this story. However, the book is a long read and some incidental themes often pull you way from the main theme of the book. Dusty comes across as a normal energetic kid with a wonderful imagination. Readers will be able to relate to his problems and eventual triumphs over each."
2,Rubberized Belt Clip,The rubberized coating fails to stay attached in areas but otherwise good belt clip...amazing price.
1,not quite right,"The holster is supposed to be designed to fit the motorola KRZR, but when I got it, the holster is just slightly too small. occasionally the phone ""pops"" out of the holster. I figured it would cost me more to try and return it than it would just to buy a different one."
4,Very Happy with Product,ASIN:B001F2XV9O Mally Beauty Cancellation Concealer System 1 ea]]I am very happy with this product. I have been using it for years. It is the only concealer that is really a concealer and does not come off during the day. I just wish that you could purchase the concealer alone
1,Comes off within minutes.,In the demo Mally shows her putting the product on her hand then trying to rub it off. This is bull. If fades and comes off even with the powder in minutes. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
3,Too light,I purchased this item in the color: rich. It was creamy and smooth. It was very spreadable to but it was simply too light. I found that I had to add MAC concealer and blend together. That took just too much time in the morning. I am now using make-up forever concealer along with Mally's concealer setting powder ...works great.
1,Garry odom fl.,Very disappointed bought a rc boat ( NQD757-069 )radio control speed boat the boat isover 2 feet long (beam hull:27.5 in long 14in wide shipping weight:10 Lbs ?= receved the boat today was only 17.1/4in long and 9.5 in wide PS I'm woundering if you sent me the right BOAT ? I thought I was getting A nice BOAT.
2,"Started out fun, but didn't stay that way","This RC boat looked great in the package, assembled well, and performed OK on the water the first time...but no where near as fast as the video on youTube made it look like. By the 10th outing on the water one of the two motors stopped working. That was awkward, since the boat steers by turning off one of the motors to run in a circle.Inexpensive, but built that way too."
1,Disappointing,"My 6 year old saved up Christmas and birthday money so he could get an RC boat...very proud of him for his patience! after reviewing several boats online for almost 2 hours, we chose this one. upon arrival, we assembled it, charged it up and took it out the next day for a spin on the pond. battery lasted for no more than 10 minutes. there were cracks all around the body of the boat allowing water to seep into the battery compartment. i had to buy some watercraft sealant and seal it up myself for the next escapade. so, the 2nd time we put it on the pond, battery having been charged up and cracks sealed, the engine ""ggrrrrdd"" a bit and the boat didn't move. he's so bummed about it and i am seriously annoyed at the time, trouble and money i've put into a toy that actually operated for about 8 minutes. KEEP LOOKING for a different boat!"
1,SLOWEST EVER! JUNK!,"The boat looks cool and thats where it ends! Boat is heavy and a slug. Save your money and get a Proboat or the Miss Vegas by Aquacraft. Any other ""toy"" boat would be better then this piece of junk. I have a Sea Ray cabin cruiser that went 3 times faster and handled better then this ""Hydro"""
5,Well Researched- Very Well Written,"I read both of Bryan Rigg's books. I was amazed that so much well researched history could be told so well. If my college history text books had been so well written I might have actually enjoyed history.I think both Rigg's books are MUST reads for everyone who wonders how the Third Reich happened and want to understand the pschy of that time in history. Bryan's excellent work adds an other element of understanding to the era. If we don't know and remember we will repeat it, or something like it or something worse, somewhere, sometime in our and our childrens' lifetime. Never again!"
5,An almost unknown story,"I have a former co-worker who I knew was half Jewish and was in the German Army during World War II. He told me how he hide his back ground to protect both his mother and him self. He was an engineering student in the early YEARS OF THE WAR, BUT WITHDREW FROM COLLEGE AND ENLISTED, SO AS TO AVOID BEING VETTED FOR A COMMISSION, AS A RESULT OF GETTING AN ENGINEERING DEGREE. He was fortunate to become a radio operator and repair technician due to his engineering background. He was in France during his Army years and based on his father recommendation he surrendered as quickly as he could after Normandy. Surrendering without getting shot from either side was the most dangerous part of his Army career.I though that he was unique. This well written and documented volume opened up a whole new piece of history to me."
1,load of cr#@$!,"Besides this book being written with juvenile flair,it's obvious to us who know better that it's nothing more than a throw together with a catchy selling title.Anyone who is well informed on this subject will easily spot the rampant bias and shaby research.Mr. Rigg should go back and review his account of the Wannsee conference.At no point in the minutes of the W. conference is there talk about murder or extermination or anything else.Perheps Mr. Rigg should take up a career in fictional novels?I wouldn't even bother with this book."
1,Handbook for Single Mothers Raising Little Boys,"This book was terrible. It is poorly written and the content is useless. I was so disappointed. The book jumped from topic to topic. It didn't give any useful advice or provide any humor to this situation. I was hoping for a well written book with advice and content, with some comic insight on the issue of raising my son without a father...and I got 34 page, stream of consciousness essay by a very bad writter with a very bad editor. Not exactly worth $14.95...Maybe I wouldn't be so angry if the book had only been $3.95 instead!I wish there was a buy back policy, because I would send this book back in an instant! Don't waste your time or your money!"
5,Nice looking watch with roman numerals and clean lines.,I like the look of this watch which has nice clean lines with a white face and black roman numerals and hands. The second hand is gold like the case. The case is also fairly thin at about 0.25 inches (0.5 cm).I did not find the strap too small as indicated in two of the reviews. I must have smaller wrists. I measured the length of the strap from the the buckle to the pre-drilled holes and it should fit wrists with a circumference of 6.75 to 8.25 inches (17.5 cm to 21 cm). There is an additional 0.5 inches (1 cm) in which you could drill your own hole.
4,keeps good time but the strap is tiny and date window is small,"The watch has clean lines and so far appears to keep time accurately. The leather watch strap, however, is quite small. I don't have particularly large wrists, but even when the last(7th)opening is used the band is too tight. With the strap adjusted to the first position, it practically fits my Yorkie - hardly a man sized watch!Also, the date window is a bit small for those of us whose eyesight is beginning to fade."
4,keeps good time but small,"The watch keeps very good time and is nice looking. I only have 2 compaints:1. The band is quite small. I do not have a large wrist, but the strap is on the last notch. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a medium or large wrist.2. I left 2 messages with the technical department at Bulova to determine if there was a problem or if I could get a larger size. No response."
4,Bulova watch,"I was very pleased with the watch itself, but I thought that the strap was cheap.I ended up buying a new strap for it."
5,my new Bulova,"Anybody considering for a formal looking, not too expensive watch, should consider this bulova witht he Roman numbers. My only dislike is the fact that setting the day requires going around and around until the correct day shows up. This only happens at month end."
4,Ecstasy by Sahiba,"When one listens to great music from the Subcontinent from the depth of the heart arises the word ""Waah"" or ""Aha"" depending on which side of the border where one claims root. Begum Abida ( Rani Sahiba ) will transport you there from the first note... As some of the other reviewers have said earlier, she has been eclipsed by the collosus Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Sahib. In Khan Sahib's household music collection must be racks of Begum Abida Parveen."
1,"lasted one day, awful customer support","I plugged this into my Dell computer only to come back a few hours later to the smell of smoke. The LEDs melted the center of the pad, and nearly destroyed my $90 mouse. When I called (30min on hold) the company they said to send it back (pay for shipping myself) to them along with $10 to ship the replacement. It would be cheaper just to buy a new one.Even if it didn't almost start a fire, the mouse pad surface was uneven/bumpy and the only thing it was useful for is the USB hub. Thus, the table itself would make a better mouse pad. Its hard to imagine a company messing up a mouse pad, but this company did it."
5,Beautiful,Definately a work of art. Combines rock/electronic very well. If you are a rock fan I recommend this instead of their more recent works. Go nebula!
3,This was a gift,I never listened to it as it was a gift to my son. I think I heard one song on the radio and it is definitly not my type of music.
4,Good old school Incubus,This CD is great. It's pretty hard core compared to their more recent albums but it has that raw Incubus sound. If you are an Incubus fan you will like it.
4,Nothing was changed from the original release!!!,"Incubus is now riding a wave after their Make Yourself album, so they have re-released Fungus Amongus and Science. There is nothing different than the CD, which was previously released, but the CD itself is simply great. Then never rerecorded Calgone, which was cut suddenly four minutes into the track with a speech about who's fault the cutting of the track was. Mainstream songs in an album before anyone knew about them! Full of great funny vocals, rock, unique tracks, like Magic Medicine which is a fantastic track for those of you that like turntablists! Some other great songs on the CD are Favorite Things, Calgone, and New Skin (which a live version appeared on Family Values 98). Another song to note is A Certain Shade of Green, which is a very sarcastically funny song of how slow things move in the singer's world. Even the hidden track after Calgone is hysterically funny, original and must be heard!"
5,WOW!,"Fun and experimental. I cant believe I somehow missed this back in the late 90's. I am torn between this experiemental style and the current refined style. Anyways, its amazing how talented and creative Incubus are."
3,"Maybe good for a purist, but. . .","This album is Incubus in its purest form, I believe. Full of innovation and cleverness, but not very easy to listen to. I recognize that it has incredible skill and ""musicology,"" but it is not why I bought the CD. For those of you who are like me and want to listen to something that makes sense and does not demand full attention to follow, this is not the CD for you. This CD demands your full attention, is best listened to alone and should be contemplated deeply. (Does not play well in an office environment!) I can see why it appeals to many people, and I give it immense credit for its uniqueness, but it just doesn't fit my style at this time."
2,Technicality overshadows feeling,"2 1/2Although hitting with a consistent adolescent angst showcasing the band's funk-metal skills and certainly hinting at promising things to come, without impending melodics they would develop next, Incubus's sophomore sounds little more than glorified local music dated to when biscuits were limp."
4,phat s**t,"I really liked this cd when it first came out and thought I had maybe found a band that I could follow and be a fan of. Boy was I wrong, I haven't heard all thier albums but from what I heard this is the only cd I liked, they went all softcore after this cd. They lost their funk, but this still is a very phat cd and I need to buy another copy of it sometime. mmfcl"
5,OMG!!!,"Seriously if you are a Incubus fan and you still don't have this album, YOU NEED THIS ALBUM!!! This is their best album, hands down, IT'S FREAKING AWESOME!!!! If you're not a fan, shame on you, you need to get this album it will change your mind!!"
5,Their best work,"Though I've been disappointed the more recent and popularized releases, this album remains one of my favorites. The originality and variety is simply remarkable. Sound varies from mellow and jazzy in ""Anti-gravity Love Song"" to heavy, edgy and powerful in ""New Skin"". When I first heard ""Certain Shade of Green"" I wasn't quite sure what I was hearing was real.Folks interested in pop fluff should look elsewhere. The sound of this album is unique, potent and uncomprimising. Funk, Rap, Metal and Soul are pulled together with elegance. It's really a shame that this edge has been dulled with the last couple releases."
5,The Baddest ...album,"all i got to say is listen to these tracks... redefine, idiot box, glass, a certain shade of green, summer romance,nebula, deep inside, and calgone... with CALGONE being the best. a definite sonic journey... enjoy"
2,S.C.I.E.N.C.E. In A Word...[stinks],"I became a fan of Incubus after picking up a copy of ""Make Yourself."" Their newest effort, ""Morning View"" furthur impressed me, and I assumed that this album would be more of the same. Unfortunitly.....No. This album came out before the first two, so you can tell the difference in the sound and the songs. Most of the songs on this album, seemed to have been recorded on a high speed setting, or something. There are very few smooth sounding tunes, and some real clunkers like ""Nebula"" and ""Calgone"". The only ones I found to be be any good were ""Idiot Box"" and ""Summer Romance"". I'd stay away from this effort, but if your a real fan I think most music stores have copies of them for cheap."
1,You Wha?,This Album is TERRIBLE!Not Like Incubus At All.It is Just A Bunch of mindless Singing With No Rythum.I Was DissapointedBetter Albums:Make YourselfMorning ViewA Crow Left Of A Murder
5,"Wow, what an awsome CD","My title sums up my feelings on this album. Its a rock solid CD with funky beats, hard hitting riffs, and deep, analytical vocals. Go buy it right now, seriously. If you're a fan of the band this CD will instantly become your favorite CD by them. The bassline on songs like Deep Inside will blow you away, and Anti-Gravity Love Song is just too chill for words, its the perfect jam song.Buy the CD NOW!!"
5,Good Very Good,This Album Is Very Energetic. There Is Really No Melow Song On This. It Sorta Reminds Me Of Lost Prophets 2000 Release( The Fake Sound Of Progress) Like A Certain Shade Of Green. The Melow Anti-Gravity Love Song Is Awesome And The Softest Song On There.If You Like The Rougher Harder Side Of Incubus I Would Recommend This Album Any Day Of The Year. It Is A Funk Album All The Way.It Is Much Different Than Make Yourself Or Morning View. I Still Like Make Yourself Better But It's A Good Album.
4,Wow...,"This CD is not for everybody, I will admit that. It kind of gives off an old Red Hot Chilli Peppers feel and they also use their DJ so much more in this album.If you're buying this CD based off ""Morning View"" and ""Make Yourself"", then you're in for a real surprise. This reminds me of druggie music. Lots of sound effects, some weird bass and a lot of weird DJ scratches and such. More of a funk/grove kind of music than anything.Best song on this CD? Well, there are three in my opinion. ""Redefine"", ""Vitamin"" and ""New Skin"" are all pretty kick ass, but the whole CD is, so pick it up. Good stuff."
5,The most amazing album from the most amazing band,"This is the best Incubus album by far. It is very hard and fast and personally, I thought Gavin was a better DJ than Kilmore. My next favorite album is the jazzy Fungus Amongus followed by Make Yourself. At first I didn't like Morning View, but after I listened to the technicality and musicianship, it grew on me and I can respect all of Incubus works and whatever they choose to do in the future."
1,Critisism,"In this book the author is trying to make a statement about the Harry Potter books and telling her negative view of the book to other people. She taking her own interpretation of the book and presenting it as fact. I give her all my respects, but try reading the books through a child's eyes, with an open mind. I quite enjoyed these books for there magical and whimsical qualities. And I think that no child should be denied the opportunity to read these books, just because their parents read this particular book and already formed a negative view in their head based on the author's interpretation of the book."
4,Whiteside drawer bit,"Good quality bit, but not an easy setup. Whiteside does not offer any instructions with this bit. Once it is set up it makes a strong, attractive drawer joint"
2,just a cheap space blanket,"I thought it might be a little better than the usual ""space blankets"" that are like plastic with reflective surface on one side, but that is exactly what it was. No more than the usual 99 cent space blankets."
3,The case needs to be more durable,"I would like the flatware to be a better grade as well as the case I would even pay more, also food particles goes in the knife area...the case is not made out of a durable constructions its not made to last..."
4,These are great,"I bought these to use at work, and I really like them much better than the bamboo set I had purchased earlier. The fork broke on that set. The plastic is pretty useless and didn't close properly after a few weeks of use so I tossed it."
5,Great product,This set gets the job done! It's a neat little combination. Compact and easy to pack; I don't like the case though.
2,A PIECE OF JUNK,THE UNIT CONSTANTLY FREEZES UP AND THE THE DETAIL SUCKS/ I HAD AN AUDIOVOX FOR 2 YEARS AND NEVER HAD ABIT OF TROUBLE. I ONLY DECIDED TO GET THIS BECASE IT WAS CHEAPER THAN A NEW BATTERY.
1,Terrible quality,"I purchased this for my soccer team. At its first game, a parent pulled the bag and the fabric ripped. Epic quickly sent a replacment bag. Then one week latter, the bottom seams came apart on the second bag. Rather than request a third bag I just sewed it back together. Two weeks after that the sholder straps ripped from the bag. Epic has credited my account & I'm going to look for a totally different bag.I don't like to talk bad about a product, but this one is really terrible. I wouldn't want other coaches to make the same mistake. Epic has great service, no doubt, but this ball bag is very poor quality."
5,Great mixer for our holiday drinks!!,"Great mix. We use it for Brandy Old Fashions and tastes better than the Old Fashion mix, with no calories!!"
5,"GREAT SYRUP, ZERO CALORIES","IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND SUGAR FREE SYRUPS. i LOVE CHERRY (DIET) COKE AND THIS SYRUP FILLED THE TASK. THE PUMP SQUIRTER MAKES IT REAL EASY TO ADD TO A GLASS OR PITCHER. i KEEP THE BOTTLE ON MY KITCHEN COUNTER. THE TASTE IS JUST AS GOOD AS IF YOU PURCHASED DIET CHERRY COKE DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPERMARKET. THE SUPERMARKETS DON'T ALWAYS CARRY DIET CHERRY COKE. AMAZON'S CLICK TO BUT, THEN SHIP TO MY FRONT DOOR MAKES IT EASIER THAN EVER. FIVE STARS."
4,FOR REAL!!,"MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD IS ""NO RHYME, NO REASON"". THIS CUT IS FOR REAL, TRUE TO LIFE ABOUT LOVE AND BEING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE YOU CAN'T HAVE. GEORGE DUKE HAS STYLE AND CHARISMA LIKE NO OTHER. THE LYRICS AND MUSIC IS FROM THE HEART AND SOUL OF HIS MINE!!"
1,This is an old version!,"There is a new version of this out-dated product!While the ASL Deluxe product (Instant Immersion American Sign Language Deluxe) is probably the way to go, there is a new 5 CD ROM ASL edition out from TOPICS too at about the same (or lower) price as this old one, called TOPICS ENTERTAINMENT Total Immersion American Sign Language 2.0 ( Windows ) here on Amazon.There is also a new basic 2 CD ROM package with selected new content.The NEW versions have a dark-haired woman on the box.It's confusing because they have called this outdated product 2.0 as well.Check out the new edition(s) before making your decision!*** New comments 07-12-2006 ***Ok, now the picture shows the new box, but the description is still for the old version of the product. Still a bit confusing. If this is now a listing for the new 2.0 product, the one now pictured, I highly endorse it."
1,"Okay, I take it back!!","This album [stinks], I thought Blink would be singing the songs, these guys sound like their from China. I listened to a clip from Anthem Part Two, it blowed!! Anthem Part Two is one of my favourite songs, and they made it stink, a bunch of Blink [copies], who'd actually pay for this cd, I wouldn't, waste of time! Anything that's not Blink, is no good! Well, there are other good bands out there, not like Blink! This album is proof at how bad other bands are compared to Blink, yippers! This [stinks], don't get it!! You'll regret it!!"
5,Dude,Dude the thin that one guy wrote about steven hawkins is the funniest and truest thing i have ever read in my entire life. I gave this cd and his review 5 stars. whatever.
3,Incomplete,"It's okay, it just needs stuff from Dude Ranch and Cheshire Cat (Dammit, Carousel, Wasting time, M&Ms, Josie, Emo, I'm sorry...)"
1,a joke,"as a huge fan of blink, i thought from the samples amazon gave, i had heard enough. the voices were all computers that did not emulate or give any positive tribute to mark, tom, and travis. the instruments were just the ones from the real blink CD's; the ""various artists"" did not even play the instruments. no one could play drums like travis anyway.don't waste you hard earned money for this. buy real blink albums, not this garbage. this CD deserves to burn in the pits of hell.who produced this album?whoever did should be fired.anyway, peace out everyone, the real blink-182 rocks, but this is just a crime against humanity and gives the human race a bad nameps: if i did not have to give this CD any stars, i wouldn't have, and anyone who is dumb enough to give this album more than one stars should take a listen to real blink 182 and stop listening to complete trash such as thisROCK ON BLINK!!!!"
1,___---***THIS IS A FAKE ALBUM***---___,I think I am the only one who realizes that this album was made by some person in their basement with like a computer and little equipment. The vocals are a COMPUTER VOICE! And the rest is either poorly (illegally) dubbed from the original or probably made with digital instruments and sound effects. Anyone who likes this album needs to know how to distinguish people from soon-to-be A.I. [very sad]
1,A Disgrace To Blink 182,"This album is a disgrace to one of the finest bands ever to perform. I don't even know who recorded these songs, and if I did, I would not support them by buying this album. To make a tribut to Blink, you need to capture the SPIRIT of Blink, and this album certainly does not. There is no energy in the vocals, and the instrumentation is poorly done. For these people to try and make money off Blink is, in my opinion, lower than low."
1,dont buy this piece...,this is the worst tribute ive ever heard! there are only songs from enema of the state and take of your pants and jacket. it sounds like a country computer is singing the songs. it sounds like they have to pronounce every word perfectly. especially in anthem part 2 when they say hostile. that cracks me up. but it [makes me mad] that somebody would actually produce this...
2,Are they from the South??,"OK first, the band that's singing over pronunciates EVVERY SIINNGGLLEE WWOORDD. It all sounds slowed down so they can make sure to get out every syllable gramatically correct. The singer also sounds like hes from the south or something and it just doesn't flow with the music."
1,Why doesn't Big Eye Co. name it United Baloney?,"I mean this nonsense I sampled sounds th@ felt like drunk, high, school seniors & college freshmen trying 2 sing like Blink 182! It's the same with Razor & Tie Co. who produced 5 Kidz Bop CD's or should I say 5 Kidz Flop CD's? Anyway, try some other CD's than the Kidz Flop series &/or the so-called ""A Tribute To Blink 182."""
2,Bad,"Who are these guys? I mean the songs are good, but they are only good when blink performs them. These are just wannabes that spent all of their time wasting it on making this record, no, nevermind, its not even good enough to be a record, it's just a CD. These guys don't even sound good. They're off beat and sound like some guys going through puberty, you know, the scratchy squeeky voices? Yea, it would be more worth you money to buy the real CD's, instead of these wannabes without a future in the music business."
1,NOT HAV IT,"AIGHT I DONT HAV THIS CD. I JUST LISTENED TO THIS STUPID PLAY THING AND IT SUX ASS, WHAT THE HELL, DOES THIS DUDE HAV SOMETHIN WRONG WITH HIS NOSE, IS THIS A JOKE, IM SERIOUS IS THIS MEANT TO BE A JOEK, I BET IF BLINK KNEW ABOUT THIS THEY'DE BE KILLIN SOME PEOPLE"
1,Review of Tribute to Blink 182,"This is just so terrible. There is no originality involved in making this ridiculous excuse for a tribute album. I know it should be similar, but there's a difference between Trying hard to copy and failing, and putting a small twist to your favorite band. Vocals are just a laugh....Various artists i see....but why do the vocals sound the same in every song? Blink 182 will feel untributed by this, spend your money somewhere else."
1,Don't get this CD,"This is the worst form of cover songs I have ever heard in my entire life. I have no idea who these so called singers are but they suck. Stick to the real Blink 182, they rule. Even from someone older then the boys of Blink I still think they are the best thing to hit the music scene in a long time."
1,Is this for real,"What the hell is this?? Is this even a real album? I've never heard of it before so I downloaded some of the samples. It's the same vocals over watered down blink songs, not other bands doing different renditions. And where is the list of the bands that this is supposed to be? I can't find it anywhere. And why would a band who is at the top of thier game have a tribute album? Things don't add up."
2,hahahahahaha,"oh my god! this cd sucks so bad, yet it makes me laugh. it sounds like weird al just did karoke with blink's songs. i gave it two stars for making me laugh."
1,"So, So, So Bad","This sounds like it was made by the same people who made the Kidz Bop CD. People, THIS IS NOT BLINK! It is some guy with the worst voice I've ever heard (It sounds like he should be singing country) singing their songs off of a lyrics sheet. Words to not describe how lame this is. When I heard about a Blink Tribute CD, I was hoping to have a bunch of really good punk bands remaking and revamping all the Blink classics. But instead I get some lame guy singing like crap and not even doing any of the classic songs from cds BEFORE ENEMA. Come on people, making a Blink Tribute CD and not having Dammit, Josie, Pathetic, Carousel, or M&Ms is just ridiculous. I didn't buy the CD, and I'm so thankful that I listened to the samples before I ordered it, or else I would be really mad. Let me know when some REAL bands do a Blink Tribute, only then will I buy it."
5,haha,this album makes me smile...you gotta give em credit at least they like blink..even though you would think they could do the vocals a lot better..but oh well..id like to make a tribute..it would include alot of older stuff..but alas i dont have a band..and barely know how to play the guitar so oh well again.
2,"Okay, what's so bad about this album","besides the fact that it's not Blink 182, and it's sang by another band! this album is the worst I've heard in a long time, don't get it!"
3,this is possibly the funniest thing i've ever heard,"apart from totally destroying blink songs, it's funny.if you haven't yet listened to the samples, imagine a chinese steven hawkings with a cold, reading a bit of paper with some lyrics, and singing them all on one note, over a blink 182 midi file, making sure every song is the same speed. this CD is the result....Although it's so funny, the music really (...)"
1,...????,The topic says it all. Shame on any one of you who buys this ...CD. I can't believe they're even selling this! It's pathetic! Their accents sound like computer geeks who have no life and out to make some money and try to sound like a pop-punk band!! DO NOT BUY THIS ...CD!!! I BEG OF YOU!!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD AT ALL COSTS!!
1,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!,"This is horrible. Blink 182 is my favorite punk band. I have everyone of their albums. I personally like the words more when their slurred, rather than this over pronunciated crap that this band is trying to sell. To me this band sounds like a gang of nerdsthat like blink 182, created a computer simulation of the backround music and started singing the words over, making them all over pronunciated. Im scared, what punk band are they goin to try remaking now... Green Day or something?"
2,this is a best of album?,"Take every heavy metal cliché for song titles, simple but lame lyrics, and tired and retreaded riffs...put them together in one album and you have...Fuel to the Fire by Victory. And !"
2,NOT A BEST OF --- old songs with a new singer,"Prepare to be disappointed, this is old songs with a new singer. As per previous review...re-recording old songs with a new and different singer is the textbook definition of nonsense and bull. Hope they do a real best of someday, the ""That's Live album is great."
3,Stacked design is flawed,"I used to see these in the office supply stores (and even at Target) all the time, but not this winter. I bought the cheapest units possible, but still I think they're overpriced. Most problematic, however, is the flaw in the stacking design. There isn't a catch in the back to stop backward sliding, so the stacked units can slide off in either direction, forward or backwards, if you have them freestanding. Since there is no stabilizing or fixed position, I wouldn't recommend more than 1 level."
1,disapointed,"I want my money back. I thought I was getting top 3d quality, and what I got was a screw ball movie that I could not watch properly because you can only watch the movie with the cheapo 3d glasses you get with the cd and can't use active glasses. Don't buy."
2,More Torture Crap,"Scar is very similar to last years Chain Letter, in that is another torture porn movie masquerading as a teen slasher movie. I wasn't a big fan of Chain Letter, and I'm even less of a fan of Scar. If it weren't for Angela Bettis or some old-school slasher moments early on, then this would be a complete waste. And I absolutely hated the reveal of the killer. It was someone that I initially liked and I didn't want him/her to be the killer. I really wish this torture porn era in horror would end already. I liked Saw and I liked Hostel, but almost everything in this subgenre that has been released since those two films have been either average or horrible. Scar isn't horrible...but when that's the nicest thing I can say about a movie, it's far from good."
2,didnt like 3D ???,"To start. Forget the 3D it's no good. There isn't really any special effects that requires 3D. Watch it in 2D. If you like Saw and Hostel you love this movie. Lots of gore, blood torture. Don't pass this up. .."
2,Poor Quality Blue Ray 3-D,I could not even watch this movie as quality of 3D was worse than using those of the old cardboard glasses! Had no problems with the transaction or delivery of the seller.
2,1940's 3d,"did not like the 3d on this movie let alone the 3d glasses that u must use to watch this movie i prefer to watch in 2d instead,the movie itself is so so"
3,"I'd see it once . . . maybe twice, etc.","Very excited to be turned on to this movie. Even more excited to find it online! The story is a little more interesting than the actors chosen to portray them. Although I did enjoy seeing Chris Titus in his role as small town sheriff. I wish there had been more of him doing a little more than his fairly straight man act. Capable of so much more. Again, I thought the story was interesting enough to watch once, maybe twice, etc. Though, for the price, worth the convenience and time spent. Thank you Amazon!"
3,Underestimated,Because of its smaller budget and lack of advertisement it may be overlooked but this one really is a must have for horror collectors and the fact that it's one of the few rare horror DVDs you can still buy with the good old fashioned 3D glasses is a nice touch.Definitely shocking in some parts. It's not an academy award winner but it's fun. Check it out. Angela Bettis is always worth watching.
3,Decent acting. Horrible release.,"This was released in anaglyph 3d and just doesn't work in anaglyph in any way. The field of vision (for amatures the limit of the screen) is set several feet past the screen which doesn't work at all in anaglyph. Also the color filters don't match the format. The included glasses are for red-cyan while the image is red-green.That set aside, this movie is from an independant company that we used to call B-movies and for a B-movie really isn't that bad. The writing and acting isn't horrible and really worth watching if you can stand really bloody violence. For some reason Christopher Titus got roped into this movie which was a suprise but probably just to sell discs and actually did a pretty good job.Bottom line, watch this movie if you like B-movies because it is made on video but don't waste your time or money on the 3-D version because it doesn't work."
2,A surprise snoozer from Secada,"Don't get me wrong - I LOVE Jon Secada and own everything else he's ever done - even the Pocahontas soundtrack where he only sings on one track.If you like Christmas music to listen to while falling asleep, then this would be perfect for you. It's just a waste because Secada has such an amazing, powerful voice, and it is almost never heard on this album.If you want to try out Secada, don't start with this album. He is a wonderful artist, but I just feel that he was very underutilized here. Luckily, you can listen to thirty second snippets of the tracks on this CD on this page, and can decide for yourself."
5,WOW ; great songs,This singer is one of my favorites. My best song I enjoy is on this cd is The Christmas Gift I Want. I personally give Jon Secada my top stars.
4,An Excellent Go-To Disc,"...and Dan Matz (though not listed by Amazon here) is the co-artist with M. Gira. Matz brings all the songsmith maturity his erstwhile band, Windsor For the Derby, had attained, and I love his hushed but perfectly close and clear vocals. When Michael's baritone comes in, that old Swan, your heart just swells and an even fresher balance is realized. These are good songs, some better than either the average Angels of Light or WFTD tunes. Warm and consistent tone throughout. They should collaborate again, and you should get this one."
3,Not my favorite synthetic reeds,"Ezeedrones are OK synthetic reeds, but don't have the harmonics and full, rich tone as some of the other choices in drone reeds. The Ezeedrone tenors have a very warm mellow sound. The bass leaves a lot to be desired. It's weak and shallow. Still a good drone reed set for beginners, but intermediate to professionals will probably want to swap the bass drone reed with another make to improve the sound of their bass drone."
4,Great Value,"Overall a great value. Does not have an adjustable limit switch for the up and down positions :( but it operates smoothly and quietly. The RF remote is great. No easy way to mount the main control box to the wall (a couple of holes for screws would be sufficient, but there's no place to attach screws ""out of the box""). Mounting brackets were supposed to be included for the screen but they were not. This was not a problem for me, however, because I intended to mount the screen directly to the wall all along (very easy to do once you supply your own mounting screws with the correct diameter heads). The bottom bar is not heavy enough to fully stretch the fabric to prevent some bowing of the screen, but you get what you pay for. Again, an overall great product for the money."
3,An average TV/Movie screen at a good price,"This EliteScreens 120""(4:3) Diag. Electric screen is part of my first true home theatre. I've grouped it with an HD projector, 5.1 Surround, and loge seating from a 70's movie theatre. Authentic, except for the beer, and private bath. The novelty and convenience of an electric screen is great. When the screen is up it's as if there's no TV in the room. The smooth roll of the screen coming down by remote adds a feeling of oppulence to the whole experience (for better or worse). As for the screen itself, the reflection seems good, tho I really have nothing to compare it to. My only complaint is the slight wave @ the bottom 6"" of the screen. It's more apparent in low horizontal lines. I compensate for this by lowering the screen at least 6"" lower than the image being projected. I would've also liked to have seen a couple of ""L"" brackets, or other kind of simple mounting hardware included."
3,Introduction to the Code of Maimonides,"I bought this book because of its content. However, I ordered the hard cover version and I did not get it. In spite of that, I am completely satisfied."
4,This is a decent book.,"This is a decent abridgement of Madame Blavatsky's most famous work, the Secret Doctrine. As the introduction says, this version was introduced to spark interest in people to get the full, unabridged version. It would seem to have worked - one week after I bought this abridgement, I went out and got the full version of it by Theosophical University Press. I was not disappointed in the least."
2,Disappointed,I thought there was a lot of boring material which did not include Lucy - Not so much the old stuff - a waste of money.
1,hate it,worst oldfield album ever. bought this one first and hated it and thought that all his work would be as crappy as this album but i was wrong his first tubular bells was classic i have it on vinyl and love it but this is horribal.but i'm not combleatly putting this album out saying its horribal and everything sucked i liked sunjammer sentinel dark star and clear light.
3,"Just OK, not like Tubular Bells I","I got this as a gift, and the receiver said: ""Tub. Bells II, turns out, I never heard before. It isn't nearly as good as the 1st one. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who thinks it will be like #1; they'll be disappointed."" The shipper on this one was quite a bit slower, but everything arrived just fine."
5,Awesome Album,"I remember when my music teacher bought this album when it was first released and he said that the class was now going to listen to this whole album, we were all blown away by the sheer emotion and sounds that oozed from this masterpiece. It was like an orchestral ambient piece, continuing as one piece of beautiful music to bless those adolescent welcoming ears. This album will go on forever as one of the greats."
3,the music that make me feel good,"when i heard tb1, that was really shocking and fantastic, but tb2 was little bit weak&too warm,but i listend over&over, i thoght even tb2 is not good enough but still mike is genius."
2,Oldfield arruina su pasado.,"No es que Tubular Bells II sea absolutamente malo, no. Es que es bastante malo y además es trampa. ¿Cómo un ex-hippy, ex-innovador, ex-antiestrella puede llegar a ser todo lo contrario? ¿Cómo se puede caer en un auto-plagio tan descarado e improductivo?"
2,Some good tracks...,"I first bought Tubulars Bells III, just because I kind of liked the cover. Turned out to be the best impulse-buy I ever made. After seeing that Tubular Bells 2 got an even better review here on Amazon, I went out and got that too - what a dissapointment. There are a few good tracks, but some tracks are very weak and don't seem to belong on this CD. One aspect of Tubular Bells 3 that was completely missing in Tubular Bells 2 is thematic unity. This one's just a collection of melodies - but TB3 had a definite introduction, development of theme and melodies, and a *spectacular* finale. If you're new to this type of music, buy volume 3, but give this one a miss."
1,A Pale Imitation of the Original,"I'm a big Oldfield fan from his early, pre-TB days with Kevin Ayers and others and on to his early solo work. The original TB was amazing and much imitated, but this is a shallow retread. The same format and musical themes appear, but nothing new is added. Avoid it."
1,A stinker for fans of the original,"Mike Oldfield rapidly followed his ground-breaking debut ""Tubular Bells"" with two other equally insightful, and perhaps more mature, works--""Hergest Ridge"" and ""Ommadawn."" While they were not commercial successes on the scale of his first album, neither did they emulate it, which allowed them to stand on their own merits. Unfortunately, after two subsequent decades of hits and misses, ""Tubular Bells II"" commits the cardinal sin his follow-up efforts avoided. This carbon copy sounds like an advertising jingle avoiding copyright infringement. It smacks of commercial aspirations, and bombs on artistic merit."
5,A terrific toolkit for dealing with life's challenges,"This book was sent to me by a friend who had found it helpful and thought I could use its lessons during a down period in my life. My friend's life story is so full of disasters, unlikely events, awful coincidences, and physical and emotional upheavals that it would make any writer of soap operas blush to use it as a plot thread. Still, she has this quote from Abraham Lincoln on her email ""stationery"": ""Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.""This book can help you be that strong."
2,Look nice but don't work well,These blades look really nice. But don't buy them. They streak horribly and are more for decoration than actual use. I wish I had not bought them.
1,Snake eater,"Im sorry for any person having seen this movie I watched it over the weekend and found myself wondering if maybe there is no god. This movie made me belive that with a thimbleful of talent somebody you know with a camera and nothing better to do on a weekend than make a movie I too can break into the acting business. I believe my favorite line in the movie was when the mother was describing what her daughter had received from her biker friends and I quote ""a raging case of gonneria and genitle herpes"". Although I did feel sorry for the truck driver she ended up making nookie with who will now go through life knowing his only chance at a nympho got him the little gift that just keeps giving."
1,snake eater,"God help any person who wasted their time seeing this movie. I had the ""pleasure"" of watching this movie and I can tell you...WOW. I must say my favorite scene was when the mother of the girl was describing what had happened to her after being gone with and I quote "" a raging case of gonneria and genitle herpes"" I felt most sorry for the truckdriver who for his first time finding a nymphomanic will no have the gifts that keep on giving."
1,The third one is as bad as the first 2,"This movie was one of the most pathetic movies i have ever seen! The actng is terrible and the plot sucks. This is a cheap low budget film, not even worth renting."
2,Mogami Cable,"I can't really tell the difference between this cable and my Monster Cables. However, it seems to work fine. I bought it used. And boy, has it been used! Although advertised as being in good condition, there was a cut in the cable. In the future, I'll buy new, rather than used. This is a very expensive cable."
2,Doesn't work with >2GB SD cards,"Seems to work fine with my 2GB Compact Flash card, but it won't read either of my 2GB SD cards."
3,Taxi: The Final Season,"The season has some good laughs but the audio is very poor, which appears to be typical of 1980s technology. Good for die-hard TAXI fans, but somewhat boring for 21st century viewers."
2,not what I was expecting,This product was not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be divided and it is just one compartment. It seems durable and of good quality so as long as that is what you are looking for then it is a good choice.
2,"Pretty dodgy, at best...","I dunno... It seems weird, a bit dishonest, even, to characterize most of these tunes ""Gram Parsons"" songs... The enclosed booklet even reprints some examples of the original Parsons doodle/scribbles... and he had written BETTER VERSIONS of the mysteriously revised lyrics that Carl Jackson & Co. recorded! I know the GP cult is all-powerful and all that, but this project really seems to strain our credulity..."
2,YOULL BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT I SAY.,Some of the songs sounds like gram parsons lyicly anyway.I would have rather just had a copy of the lyics.Another cd with Gram Parsons name on it just to make money off of hard-core fans.I am a big Gram fan and I have listened to it two times and its been a coaster ever sence.
3,Quick read...,I'm a speed reader who likes romance and fantasy. This was a quick good read for me - I'd read more by this author. Typical plot...
4,Silken Threads,I like P.B. Ryan. She is an easy and entertaining read. If you like Victorian mysteries she is quite good.
3,a nice but not exceptional read,"a nice, enjoyable book, however it will not be joining my shelf of keepers to be reread."
3,A decent read,"It didn't overly excite me, but I finished it. An alright story that just lacked a little something to make it truly stand out."
4,A suspense more than a romance.,"Not much romance(3 stars), but the story is good(4 stars). This is much more than a romance. Patricia Ryan kept enough suspense going to keep me turning the pages. I thought it had an interesting plot and a very satisfying ending. Her other book, Heaven's Fire is a good story, too, with a much stronger romantic element."
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"This was an enjoyable read...it moved along nicely and it had an interesting plot. However....I didnt give it a higher score for a few reasons..1. While I did connect well with the characters..I felt that we only really had a chance to know them well separately ...it seems to me that they spent more time thinking about eachother rather than interacting. For this reason, I found that when they finally came together I didnt care as much as I would have liked to.2.I found it highly unlikely that Olive's story would end up as it did.3. There were just to many convenient happenings at the ending to make it fall into place.On the other hand, this was definitely a unique plot idea..and I didnt guess the mystery until it was revealed.Im not saying that ""Silken Threads"" was a bad book..infact I've already ordered it's sequel...All I'm saying is that it fell short of being a keeper.All in all...not bad, but not fantastic either"
5,A pleasant read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing style was wonderful and descriptive without being overly indulgent. The story was slow paced, but never lost my interest once. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy love story with some well done intrigue thrown in for good measure. I will be looking for more of Patricia's writing now that I've read this one."
4,Seminal,"This was a seminal performance that introduced Eric Clapton to a whole new generation of listeners, and showcased Clapton's blues roots to the rest of us. Clapton infuses a raw and honest soul into many of the songs, especially the live version of ""Tears in Heaven"" which was of course written for his son who tragically died. His unplugged version of ""Layla"" is also quite good, and many of the other tracks showcase a strong tradional blues sensibility that most Claption fans might not have always realized existed."
4,A CD which is good from start to end. Layla is GOOD.,Eric has made a really good live recording at MTV studios. Only thing that bothers me when I am litening the CD is too noisy audience.
5,Greatest Live Album Ever,"Eric Clapton is arguably the best white guitar player that ever picked up the instrument. But on 'Unplugged' he dies it down a few notches to bring up a type of passion, and fortitude that is not shown in his studio albums. From the acoustic version of 'Layla', to the masterpiece, 'Tears In Heaven' this album is arguably the best live album ever.This was the first album that I purchased of Clapton's when I was 12, and is still an album that I listen to today, dispite my friends thinking that I am crazy and old-fashioned for it.So I will leave you with saying to pick up this release, and if you don't, you are missing out on a remarkable 'Live' album."
5,This is the greatest Clapton yet!,"This MTV Unplugged session is not only one of Clapton's greatest performances, but one of MTV Unplugged's greatest performances. ""Layla"", ""Old Love"", ""Running on Faith"", from start to finish it's one of my top 5 favorite CD's."
2,Under par,"This par I'm talking about here is not golf, where under par is good. This album just does not measure up to Clapton's other work. Cranking out albums because you can is not alway a good idea and this is a good example of such."
2,Lo How The Mighty Have Fallen,"Proof as if any were needed, that most live albums are no good. Eric Clapton was once considered a gOd, now he's just living on the hype. His unplugged redoes of old chestnuts are as uninspiring as they are downtempo. Anyone familiar with the painful ubiquitous butchery of `Layla' will know what I mean, the whole album is done at this speed. The other well-known track is the sappy `Tears In Heaven' about which the less said the better. This album is as tiresome and worn out as Clapton himself. Let the old dog die in peace."
3,"Geat except for the SKIP in ""Runnin On Faith""","Yes, Pallas in Germany did it again. There are 2 skips in ""Runnin on Faith"". My Tom Petty, ""Damn The Torpedos""(also pressed by Pallas) has a skip in ""Century City"". I did clean my record with Mobile Fidelity's liquid cleaner and I used Mobile Fidelity's record cleaning brush. The only records in my collection that skip are pressed at Pallas. The sound quality is great. I'm staying away from Pallas."
5,"Tears In Heaven, the BEST song!!","This album is spectacular! Tears In Heaven is the BEST song! Okay, I first listened to this album a couple weeks ago and never in my life heard Eric Clapton before, seeing as he is before my time. I first put the song on Tears In Heaven because I liked the name. From the time I FIRST started listening to it I was in tears and by the end I was soaked! This song is just wonderful! The rest of the album is great too but Tears In Heaven just lights up the WHOLE album! This is a must for any Eric Clapton fan and a must for anyone who has lost someone...This album shows that Eric Clapton IS a living legend!"
5,The Best CD Ever!,"Eric Clapton is absolutely the greatest there is and there ever will be! I have had his ""Unplugged"" cd forever and a day and I listen to it about every day! I feel that if you do not have this CD that you should go out and get it! This CD will always be my favorite no matter what people say. I wish I could just tell Eric one thing.....YOU ARE THE GREATEST! I love our work.....especially ""Unplugged!"" THANKS"
4,"Unplugged: From ""Friday Night"" to Layla","The reviewer who noted that Clapton's songs are made fresher by being unplugged is right on! For me Clapton is one of founding fathers of electric guitar. His work in Cream is the subconscious. Here he is kinder and gentler, more subtle and, like a good wine, better than ever. I especially think this applies to the Johnson material (Malted Milk, Walkin' Blues). Let me note that the GODFATHER OF ALL UNPLUGGED events, ground zero for the whole phenomenon is also a guitar album, the best live one EVER recorded: FRIDAY NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO (Di Meola, McLaughlin, De Lucia). Buy it now."
4,A great gift!,My 8 year old daughter has been solving Sudoku puzzles for 2 years; the ones in the books with a pencil and eraser. We got her this for Christmas this year and she loves it!! It is perfect for anyone that loves Sudoku!
2,TERRIBLE,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF STEPHEN KING, PETER STRAUB, JOHN CONNOLLY, ETC...DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, IT IS A WASTE OF SPACE AND YOU WILL FIND IT DOWNRIGHT SILLY AND ANNOYING...IT STATES ON THE COVER THAT THE BOOK ""RECALLS VINTAGE STEPHEN KING"" i OWN EVERYONE OF KINGS BOOKS AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT ""OVER THE UNDERTREE"" DOESNT COME CLOSE TO MY LEAST FAVORITE KING BOOK...I DONT USUALLY DO THIS BUT THIS BOOK WENT INTO THE GARBAGE, AND I DIDNT EVEN FINISH IT!..."
4,great book....,"i thoroughly enjoyed this book, and, even though it is not my style to read horror books, i will read the rest of Mr. Moore's books, starting with Possessions and working my way backwards. i have heard that fireworks is an amazing book, and I know that Serenity Falls has been nominated for the Bram Stoker Award!!!!!!This seems to be an author to keep one's eyes on!byerandy"
3,PROMISING FUTURE,"The actual rating I give this book is 3 and 1/2 stars. This is my first experience with James Moore and after reading, ""Under the Overtree"", it won't be my last. Although the book is a little long, Moore somehow keeps things quite engaging with his detail of characters and his skill of quickly moving scenes. I found a lot of spelling errors throughout this book -- which unfortunately seems fairly common in Leisure's titles these days. Moore's writing is mostly smooth, but I found a few times where his sentence structure confused me and I had to re-read sections numerous times to figure out what was going on. Another issue I had with the book was the scare factor... there really wasn't any. James A. Moore is a solid writer, but his scenes of horror are still a little conservative. With all that aside, I had a lot of fun with this book and look forward to reading his newer novel ""Fireworks"" and ""Possessions""."
3,Best of the WW I flying movies,"Despite the time-worn plot and the corny love story, this is the best of the WWIflying movies. Howard Hughes spared no expense on the flight sequences, and it shows. The scenes with the zeppelin are spectacular, even though the whole miniature zeppelin was only about 10 feet long. The interior scenes in the zep are very authentic. The bomber scene later in the picture is also excellently done, even though many viewers might want to fast-forward through many of theponderous and draggy buddy scenes and the interminable love interest."
2,Why?,"Why this movie has such good reviews is beyond me! I love film noir and older black and white movies of every variety. Therefore, I was looking forward to seeing this movie for years now! While the aerial scenes were fantastic, they were rather short. Especially given the name of the movie. Having seen ""The Aviator""... and knowing how long it took to make this supposedly groundbreaking movie... I was interested to see it for myself. Which was why I was probably so disappointed in the thing! For it's time, this movie would've been incredible. Unfortunately, it is not those times anymore, and the movie is extremely dated (to say the least). So, unless your a film buff, or a film student, this movie would be a waste of time. As a Howard Hughes fanatic, I hate to give this movie such a bad review, but it deserves it."
5,Amosg The Best,"This Is the best World War One Air plane movie I have seen better than The Blue Max better than Fly Boys. Why because The yellow coward Monte was actually the smartest that He realized that emperors, kings, presidents, governors and all one person rulers start wars and People are so blind that They fight the wars they started and the Germans were so brainwashed that that They did Not even give It a second thought what They were willing to die for which Is total corruption. Did You know Benjamin Franklin was against America having a president or any type of one person ruler? At the end Roy the brother of Monte had to do something because Roy knew Monte would tell the Germans what They wanted to know. Von Righthofen also know as The Red Beron was flying a biplane Instead of a triplane. Though parts of the move was In color If the whole movie was color It would have been better. The camera work In the dog fights was as good as any modern day movie."
4,Better Than Anticipated,"It has been my experience that early talkies (1928-1931), with exceptions, tended to be slow and laborious in pacing. By 1932, they greatly improved in timing. With this in mind, I expected Hell's Angels (released in 1930) to be very trying, but it turned out to be a superb film about men in war. The drama between the men (Ben Lyon and James Hall) and Jean Harlow was rather lame, but the rest of the film showed a sophistication rare to 1930 films. I highly recommend this film."
4,Hell's Angels is A Classic,"Made many years before the age of graphic animations replacing live flying scenes, this movie is an air war enthusiast's prized asset.Howard Hughes, himself a pilot, spared no expense in getting scores of airplanes built and hired former combat pilots of WWI for the flying shots in this movie. One owes a debt of gratitude to those technicians who painstakingly restored a high quality DVD from brittle old reels of the original movie."
4,Bringd Back The Past!!,"Originally saw this film in a major theater during my youthful years and compared that memory with the present viewing of the DVD. Found the DVD restored my memory pleasantly. Although there is no full recall of all details, the salient ones are the unsatisfactory color by today's standards. and the over-dramatic acting of the players--perhaps this is due to the period recently entered from the silent era into the ""Vitaphone"" era."
3,Hell's Angels,"Less than I was hoping for; stilted acting and script, stereotypical Germans and not nearly the flying scenes I was hoping for. Howard Hughes spent millions and months and this is all he got??? On the positive side, the nighttime zeppelin scenes are amazing even today and Jean Harlow is a revelation! If her equivalent were alive today, she would push all them, Anniston, J.O. Beyonce, et.al. off the front page."
2,Money can not make a movie,Howard did not have the ability to produce a good film regardless of his access to money . Hells Angels could not come near another WW1 era movie ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT made at about the same time. He did better with women than film.
2,Howard Hughes Hells Angels,"ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS MOVIE WAS MADE WHEN MOVIES WERE STILL YOUNG.ACTION IS SLOW, BUT AERIAL COMBAT IS QUITE GOOD."
1,silly acting; poor directing; waste of time,Silly story; poorly written; aviation/dog fight scenes not worth watching the so-called plot which was exceedingly boring; pathetic dialog. Total waste of time
4,Very well done!,The movie was way ahead of its time for the time period. Very well done. I can see how it was so expensive for Mr Hughes to shoot.
4,I recommend,"I recommend this book. The character development was great, with just enough eccentricities to make them interesting, but with enough history to make them believable. The way they each deal with their frustrations mirrors real life. I keep looking for more books by Cindy Blake, or other books like this one. It was memorable."
5,Cappadonna is a brilliant man.,"I was priveleged to meet the man at the Farmclub appearance, and I must say that this guy knows what he is talking about. He deserves a greatest hits album because he needs to get paid as an artist, and like Prince he needed to free himself from the corporate conglomerate. Gza is genius, but Cappa is a lyrical god among mortal men and his content and song titles speak for themselves. Underground Unite in peace. Wu Tang Forever. peace!!"
1,Greatest Hits when you hav released 2 albums!?!!?!?!?,Cap had only made 2 or maybe 3 albums when this was made... I like Cap and the songs aren't bad but gave it a 1 becouse nobody should make a best of after 2 albums made... recommend his ALBUMS but this is cheap way of getting easy money...
4,Better than I expected.,"This was a pretty interesting DVD. Basically a national geographic journalist follows the path of the illegal diamond exporting industry. It is really very interesting. The shaky camera was my biggest gripe with it the film.I thought the film was interesting, entertaining, and informative, so I would give it a pretty solid rating overall."
4,Excellent Wagon - Plastic could be more heavy duty,"We bought this for our children and for working in the garden. Assembly was a bit involved, but is do-able with enough time. The wagon works well, but I wish that they had made the sides out of heavier plastic. I would have paid another $20 to have this. Regardless, unless you are hauling rocks, you probably won't notice."
2,Cheap plastic,The plastic used for the bed of cart is very thin and will start cracking and is so thin that a plastic welder cannot be used to repair. Too bad the manufacturer could not use thicker plastic.
2,Surprise! It's heavy & smells toxic!,"I bought this cart, and developed a headache assembling it inside. The plastic gives off a strong smell, which is not discernable outside (thank goodness). Everything about this cart is heavy, so if you have any hills or bumpy landscape to navigate, you'd better be strong. In addition, it holds very little for its weight. When you want to dump it, you will have to tip the whole cart to get everything out... because it doesn't quite get the last 15% of material. The handle won't stay up (reachable) if the cart is not on level ground, so I find myself having to grab the handle off the ground most of the time. As you might guess, I was disappointed.April, 2011 Addendum: I found another reviewer who recommended the Ursa cart - expensive, but awesome. I bought an Ursa and am considering buying another. It carries a large load, pulls easily, dumps completely, and seems to be made with non-toxic materials."
5,Gorilla Cart OK for Chimps,"Honestly this cart is a great buy for the bucks. The novel way that the reat wheels move forward when dumping is great. Stabilizes the cart and makes dumping easy. I used large flat washers on the bolt heads on the interior plastic to help keep them from being pulled through the plastic and breaking when I put it together. Pretty easy to assemble with simple hand tools. I use mine behind a tractor sometimes and appreciate the easy conversion handle. Nothing extra to buy. I don't haul 600lbs at a time but have distributed quite a bit of crushed yard gravel in small quantities and it worked well, easy to distribute the loads where you need it. Hard to find a better dump cart for less..$..I looked long and hard but decided the Ersa turf wagon cart was $300 higher and not justifiable for my needs. This is a great buy for the money and Amazon is always the best place to buy."
4,Great small cart for small jobs,"Purchased as a gift for my father, whose 60 year old wheelbarrow finally gave out. Turned out to be smaller than I envisioned even after reading the dimensions. While it's not a good replacement for the wheelbarrow, he loves it. Could be because his wife gets the most use out of it!It's lightweight but sturdy, rolls easily and turns around in a small space. The deep bucket is great for toting dirt/potting soil, kindling, small stacks of firewood, 'heavy' grocery items like ice, charcoal, pet food, etc - all kinds of small to medium haul-around-the-yard things. It's what you should expect for the reasonable price.If you need to move/dump anything heavy or sizeable, this cart probably isn't for you. We haven't come close to testing the advertised 600-lb capacity - and I'm not sure I'd want to try - but it's a great light-duty utility cart and something you should find lots of uses for."
5,Handy Cart That the Wife truly enjoys,This was a purchase to satisfy many needs for a garden cart that had a solid bottom and could haul dirt. Overall an excellent product that was sold at a very fair price.
2,horrendous to assemble -,"This cart came with the precise amount of nuts, bolts and washers needed,...if they had not had defects in the threads. Some of the nuts simply would not fit on any of the bolts and were useless.If you take on this beast, before getting aggravated, test all the bolts and nuts to find compatible 'matches' and be prepared to need some spares or better yet, buy your own and throw these out.the cart body is a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be. It might hold 600 pounds of feathers but any load that is hard could crack the bucket.that said, once put together, it is an ok cart. it dumps, tows and pulls and rolls well. It is just not as tough as the name and 600 lb limit would lead you to believe. It in not professional grade but for the money and for small home projects, its a good deal."
3,"If you don't care about tow hitching to mower, try this for $60","thoroughly researched this cart and the metal cage one, we will only be hauling branches, leaves and dirt, nothing and no where would go near 600lb tolerance, instead of buying the Glorilla version for 90 beans (with the ""sturdy"" plastic bucket), we end up buying the knockoff version: http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=productDetail&productId=288051-84694-DWX200&lpage=none for 60 beans. Well worthed every penny!"
4,Gioacco,"I use this for light yardwork and raking leaves, etc., so it is perfect for my needs. The 4 wheel design is very stable over uneven ground and small rocks. With the ""Dumping"" feature, it is easier for me to use than a traditional 3-wheeled Wheelbarrow. About the 600 Lb. capacity... the plastic is a bit thinner than I had thought, and even if it was thicker, I seriously would not try to cart around more than 100 Lbs. in it; I think it would make the cart too unstable to move safely and would be difficult to dump out (the instructions state that for dumping use to limit cartloads to less than 250 Lbs.I am very pleased with it, and hope my review will help others in their decision."
5,Very handy,"Three years later this cart is going strong. I have used it to haul mulch, garden waste, etc. It is an essential component to my garden."
1,Toy not a Tool,"Not very impressed as I ordered thinking it would be great for yard work, but the tray is very flimsy and smaller than anticipated. My kids however are loving it as a toy in the backyard. If you are looking to do some yard work I do not recommend but if you want your kids to have some fun in the back yard dumping dirt, moving logs & toys, then it will be great."
4,Good Deal,"This cart is great for small to medium loads pulled by a small to medium person. (Bottom line, if you're six feet tall and weigh 250 pounds, you'll look like a fool pulling this little guy around.) I've spent the summer hauling dirt and rocks from the driveway to the back yard. The cart dumps easily. It took some time but my husband said it was no problem to put together. I can't imagine how you would get 600 pounds of anything in such a small cart so that claim seems exaggerated but it's sturdy and MUCH easier to use than a wheelbarrow."
1,"Pain in the ASS to assembly, hardware is cheap","The cart itself might be a sturdy cart, but shame on Gorilla for using bolts with flat head end so there is nothing to grab with when using socket set on the other end. The overall assembly is the worst I have even encountered. I have assembled a lot in my time and even the instructions could have been better. Since ordering online cannot return without paying horrendous shipping fees, so will keep an finish assembling. Would not recommend purchase until Gorilla gets it act together and puts Phillips screw head bolts in the assembly. Almost tempted to go to True Value and get the right bolts with a phillips head to grip with while assembling. This should take only an hour to assemble, but it will take longer due to the lack of making it assembly friendly. Overall the cart will probably be a good item to have around, but won't know until I can get past the assembly."
4,Nice cart....,"well built frame, but, the poly tub is a little too flexible for heavy stuff. Works well in ther garden and attaches to tractor easily! Easy to clean!"
1,Decent Cart. Horrible Customer Support.,"The cart is a decent quality for the price, and assembly isn't too bad. Before starting, find the largest flat screwdriver that you own to assist assembly. The problem with my cart was that the handle was welded on 90 degrees off center making it hard to pull and impossible to mount to a hitch. I called and emailed the company and have gotten nowhere. If I had the correctly welded part, it would be a great product."
4,Spunkly little cart,"I gave the cart to my dad for xmas. He is going to use it to hall wood for the fire and yard waste to the curb. We have to wait until the snow melts to give it a test run but in the livingroom it looks pretty sturdy, tires are big and nubby, turns well and dumps! It was not easy to put together. Not impossible but it took a while."
4,"Nice wagon, assembly could be easier","After assembly the wagon works great. My only complaint is the hardware used: specifically, the slotted truss head bolts. They have large shallow non-philips screwheads, so keeping them from turning while tightening them is pretty hard, especially if you don't have a really large screwdriver. It would be so much easier if they had used hex bolts instead. This purchase was a Mother's Day gift, but if I were to purchase one for myself I would probably go buy same sized hex bolts to use instead of the included bolts."
4,a little small,"I purchased this product to replace my heavy wheel barrel, well it is just a litte too small to do that. I do find it handy to have around and easy to use though. It goes together easily and it is easy to move around the yard. As I said though, it is a little small but handy to have around."
3,Good Electric RnB!,"Chester Thomas was an eleven year veteran of the Wichita, Kansas Fire Department until an on the job injury forced Chester to resign. He turned his focus from fighting fires to making music. This CD is his second release with the group 2 Good to Go. It's a high charged, fully powered mix of Heavyshift inspired Acid Jazz and Shakatak influenced R&B. The title track and ""Everlasting"" is worth the price of the CD. Although some of the tunes I found a bit repetitive, fans of Smooth Jazz, Acid Jazz and R&B will have a hey-day listening to this CD! It's a pretty good recording!"
5,"Deep going, wonderful DVD","I love this DVD. Her yoga nata dance is beautifully set against the background of our universe. However, this DVD is not ""just"" yoga and dance, the deep meditation and the breath exercises are really going deep. It is good to be reminded, that we are the creators of our own universe, and that how we set the tune brings all good things to us. Thank you for this wonderful DVD!"
4,"If you like this song, I can't see how you could go wrong","I've wanted to get different mixes of this particular song for the longest time. When I found out there was a whole album dedicated to this song, I had to get it.The music in all the songs are definitely different than the original. If what you like best about the song is the tune, you might be disappointed, because that tune is not in any of the songs on this album.But if you like this song as much as I do, it's worth it to add to your collection of Camouflage."
4,THe MP3 files listed aren't the same as the CD,The MP3 files are not for the pictured CD. NOT EVEN THE SAME ARTIST. My rating is for the pictured CD not for the mismatched MP3 files.
5,Mickey's The Man,"Tough, sexy, with a heart of gold underneath, Mike Hammer is the ultimate private eye and Spillane is the perfect writer to capture every bit of him and his stinkin' world."
1,i need this CD,I have been looking for this CD for years now.Does Anyone know where or how I can get it?!?!?!!?
4,Chickadee Cross-stitch,"While simpler than others I have done, there is so much of the blue especially, this one got a bit boring. It is still b eautiful and any mistakes are easy to hide or account for without changing the appearance. I'd recommend this one for moderate cross-stitchers as I believe those just beginning with this handiwork would find it too boring to hold their interest for long. For those who have done this sort of thing before, it is easy to do and can be fun."
5,Just beautiful...,Such a lovely graphic. I do not do cross stitching but a friend is doing this for me and she has not complained about it so... I suppose all is as supposed to be.
4,Real life story,"Again after seeing the Hurt Locker I really liked Jeremy Renner, thought he was a great unknown actor. This movie had some really bad spots but over all it was good. I Remembered Jeffery Dahmer and the events of what he did and it brought back the memories of this horrible man. I like movies based on real events, this was was good but not one of my favorites."
1,terrible layout for an e-book,Zero formatting for the poetry. The Raven was presented as prose. Spend a dollar and get it done right.
3,Nice Book of classics,"What can I say, the formatting isn't that great and reading it on my gray low contrast kindle isn't the most fun, but this is a wonderful collection of stories."
3,Poe is a Master of Story-telling,"This version of Poe's work does not have a table of contents and thus makes it difficult to navigate through, however, it's free and Poe is a great writer so I guess the price is right. I would download it and read it as an introduction to his work if you are not familiar with it."
1,Edgar Allan Poe's INcomplete Poetical Works,"It may be free, but it's not worth it. Some of the poems only show part of it, then when you turn the page, the rest of the poem isn't there. For instance, ""The Bells"" only shows the first two verses, but when you hit ""Next Page,"" it goes straight to the next poem, ""Ulalume."" But when you go back, sometimes it does show the missing verses! So you can read ""The Bells,"" but not in the right order. Whoever created this e-book did an God-awful job of it. Ugh!"
3,Was ok but could be better,"Don't get me wrong, Edgar Allan Poe is a fantastic writer. I think this book could have had a better layout. It is still the same wonderful poems but that is the only reason i would give it three stars, for the poetry. It is a good thing it was free..."
3,Not my favorite author,"He's a bit dark for my taste, but as he is a classic and my daughter has taken a liking to a couple of his poems I wanted to include it on our new tablet."
2,edgar allan poe,It didnt think all his poems were in here so i feel it shouldnt be called edgar allan poes complete poetical works.
5,edgar allan-complete poetical works,"if you like edgar allan poe at all, they have a 5 volume set that includes almost most of his works. for the kindle they are all free."
4,I have it,"you get what you pay for and this one is a great value. Can't say that I've read it yet, but at least I have it now."
1,Needs Work,I'm a great fan of Poe but an even greater fan of having a table of contents in a book so we can find our favorite stories. This electronic edition has poor navigation.
1,Good collection spoilt by presentation,"I'm afraid that ""half-assed"" is the best I can say for this publication. No index, no effort to lay out the poems properly at all. For Heaven's sake, use a line break! You'll get a better experience reading these poems at Project Gutenberg.The biographical note is interesting, and may be worth reading if you're not familiar with the details of Poe's life, but it is writtennby a contemporary, and is, I gather, probably the Ur-document that most casual biographies draw upon.Disappointing, as Poe's poetry is really quite exception, and worthy of a decent Kindle edition. This is not it.Not recommended other than for the biography."
5,LOVE Poe,This stuff never gets old. Incredible artist. I love that these are classics are available for Kindle free on Amazon. That is primarily why I bought the kindle for my son--to give him a fun new way to get all of the timeless classics. Thanks Amazon
5,The Raven,The Raven is a immaculate piece! I enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's works because they are so imaginative and smartly written. I know there is not a table of contents but it matters not to me because I am reading one poem/work at a time. This is necessary for any literary works lover.
5,awesome,this book is awesome! it has all the poems i wanted from poe! i will get more books from edgar allen poe!
1,What. The. Cluck.,"Of course, I can't be explicit in my review, so please take it for what it's worth. Buy the real thing, not this.ZERO formatting for the poetry.IT WASN'T EVEN POEMS. IT WAS NARRATION. It has the words, so unless you're using this for some sort of speech memorization competition (even then you'd want a better book to pace your self), don't even approach this. Please."
5,Didn't Read,"OK, I've read many of Poe's works, this was downloaded at the beginning of my Kindle days because it was free, I've since deleted it and never did read it."
2,Its not specific enough. Especially for my year and model.,"It can get your hopes up for easy stuff, but the hard stuff is left out. It lacks the real stuff that shop mechanics' manuals have for each specific year and model changes. I know you; ""get what you pay for!"""
2,Covers too many years,"This book covers a wide swath, 1988 through 1996. That 8-year span includes major changes in the chassis, interior, and available engines for this car. The result is a manual that often provides only general guidance and leaves a lot out.If you want to know how to change your brake pads, and basic maintenance jobs like that, this book will be helpful. It has good photographs and it's not very expensive. However, the lack of detail about less common troubleshooting and replacement jobs, and the lack of a complete wiring diagram, makes it less useful than some of the other Haynes manuals I've used."
3,Easy to read and use,I would like to know why you state that the oil pan can be removed from the Crown Victoria without removing the motor. I have a 1992 and I followed the manual and the oil pan will not pass between the frame and motor. I even removed the cam covers but there is not enough clearance. Am I doing something wrong or is your manual wrong?
4,Worth reading...,"I think Brother Joyner has a lot of wonderful insights and I'd recommend this book. However, his apocalyptic, metaphorical style gets old quick, especially when trying to read through a double-edition like this. Joyner, like many spirit-filled ministers and teachers today, would do well to cut back on all the Revelation lingo and simply give the reader his wisdom."
5,The Vision,I'm still reading the book but so far it's an awesome revelation from God on how the devil is discouraging the believers in Christ.
3,"a smart whacko, but a whacko nonetheless","Joyner is definately not an idiot. And I suppose this book might appeal to those who are of the charismatic persuasion. However, people who claim to speak for God make me very nervous. When I see Joyner restore a withered arm PUBLICLY or make a lame man walk, as the apostles did, then I will take him more seriously."
4,The truth about your life,If you are craving the spiritual truth about life's ordeals.....don't hesitate....get this book. There are vivid imaginations of the author's visions.
2,God's handywork,"This book is one of the best ones that I have ever read. It gives you an insight to what the plans of God are, and how to obtain them. It will help you to evaluate yourself and see where you are in God. It was a blessing and a real eye opener for me"
1,Garbage Reading,"Pure occultic garbage inspired by pride and arrogance. His ""trances"" are more descriptive of what you would find at a coven meeting that something given by God. Unfortunately well-meaning but guilible Christians fall for this clap trap. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!"
2,"Wonderful for Isis, Terrible for all others","In looking for books on Egypt, I had thought this would help. If I was an Isis worshiper, this would have been an invaluable resource in my libary. I recommend this book for all who wish to devote only to Isis.However, to anyone else looking for information on any other God/dess or Egypt itself, this book is sorely lacking. Osiris, Horus, Re and other male gods were hardly mentioned except in cursory references to Isis. Hathor, Nebt-het, Sekmet/Bast and other Goddesses were demeaned only as aspects of Isis rather than the true Goddesses they are. In this and the History of Egypt, this book is lacking."
