5,great transaction,"There was a slight mistake in the order, but the seller very quickly and fairly rectified it. The book was sent fast, too. Great experience, I'd buy from them again."
1,"idiotic, predictable plot","""magician: apprentice"" and ""magician: master"" were great. epic plot, large battles, loveable chercters.In short, all you need in good fantasy (the large battles are a bounus, of course, and a very well done one in those two).Nevertheless Silverthorn is bad. really bad.Fiest's first mistake was adding the ultimate evil to the plot. don't wait for a grand war, or for any battle larger then a skirmish. don't hope to have a good plot, for the story is idiotic, ilogical and predictable. Also, there are elemnts that clearly appeard on the previos books.Don't read. Don't even consider reading."
1,Raymond Feist Silverthorn,"This is not about the story line. This is about the type of book. When I buy a book, I don't buy paperbacks. They are awkward for me. This book is a paperback that has had a hard binding put on it. It went back, as it was even more difficult to hold than a paperback. I never did get to the story!"
4,A good series continues,"I didn't like the second book in this series nearly as much as the first, and I was afraid the series might continue downhill in this volume. Fortunately, that was not the case.This book is much more plot-driven than the last book, and the events are exciting and suspenseful. I was eager to find out what was going to happen.This was much better than the last book and really got me back into the series and looking forward to the conclusion in the next book."
4,Probably the best REF novel,"Silverthorn is Feist at his best, before his original characters started collecting social security and certainly well before the mediocre Serpentwar novels.Silverthorn is where all the action is in the Riftwar series; it's the Empire Strikes Back of Feist's original trilogy. This is one of the most compelling fantasy novel's I've ever read, and it's definitely worth buying."
4,More of the magical world of Midkemia!,"I'll never claim the Riftwar series to be complex or profound, but I believe it is a magical story. Thanks to the fantastic setting of Midkemia, this simple story takes on an aura of mystique and romance unrivaled in the genre.The second book in the series, however, is not up to par with either Magician or A Darkness at Sethanon. Still, it is at once enthralling and rapturous.There is no doubt that more sophisticated fantasy abounds, but the Riftwar Saga is still a good place to begin your journey."
5,Independent Riftwar novel - but worth the read!,"Silverthorn doesn't particularly advance the greater storylineof the Riftwar struggle, but it brings new characters to life evenas it maintains the fullness of existing ones.In Silverthorn, Prince Arutha's fiancee is poisoned, and the quest, amonggood friends and new friends, is to find the cure to the poison and in the processdiscover a few more tidbits regarding the greater evils involved in the overarchingRiftwar saga plotline.Silverthorn is sometimes too ""travelly"" as Tolkien was wont to getupon occasion, but the story continues to move along and there are noboring parts. Of course, there's no need to mention Feist's abilityto write a gripping tale. -=- The BilFish"
5,Again a masterpiece.,"In the Netherlands,this book is part two because the English part 1+2 are combined in one book. Part two is (in its own way) even better then part one.It's far more sinister then the other book.Dead people are turned to life with some sort of black magic. You must read this perfect book its worth the money."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Find the good stuff and rescue the girl.This is literally your classic rescue the princess story. Other than the threat of inter-dimensional war and your usual noble family political infighting all isn't going too badly for Prince Arutha, until his fiance is poisoned by your very nasty sort of thing.This leads him and his crew (some more motley than others) on a long quest to find the one thing that can save her, with plenty of adventure and fighting to be had along the way."
5,Biometric Puzzles Revealed,"There is a lot of mystery and myth concerning biometrics and the authors did a good job of exposing the facts and revealing the truth. ""Implementing Biometric Security"" breaks down the various forms of biometric technology into easily understandable blocks of information. Very few books breakdown the different forms of biometrics to the point that this one does. This is a true guide in helping you choose between biometric authentication systems. I'd recommend it a must read prior to investing time or money into a biometric business solution. The book is chock full of data. I found myself learning something new on almost every turn of the page. The good news is that I found it a fairly easy read and a great reference book. As a bonus, there is a companion site that has some readily available programs to get your biometric effort up and running. An excellent book for your work or personal IT library."
5,Sophisticated Decoupaging,"I have to say that out of what I have seen in decoupage books and artists, Rubena Grigg has it over all. In my book, sophisticated wins out especially after one is continually confronted with the endless stream of cutesy, mediocrity in so many ""crafts"" today. This lady is an artisan!Her pictures are quite good and her decoupaged tabletop along with the black ground floral tin pitchers are BREATHTAKING....no overkill here...they are my personal favorites.The instructions, although not pictorial are adequate and the pictures will definitely inspire you to get started....I know I want to!For incredible inspiration alone, this book is worth the purchase."
1,Hard to tell if it's good or not...,"It is hard to tell if this book is something I would want to buy, as the author in her cautiousness as made it so that no images are visible. I really would like to impress upon the author that it is the visual that sells, and there are other ways to make it so that people don't copy your work."
2,Mediocre plot and horrible editing!,"I cannot believe this book ever saw an editor! I hardly ever notice typos or spelling errors (I am a terrible speller) but this book is riddled with them. Indentations, spelling, names- everything was continuously gotten wrong! Plot wise this book was okay... not enough development of the heroine and hero's relationship and I guessed the ""mystery"" half way through. If you are absolutely desperate for Victoria Holt fiction I suggest you borrow this book instead of wasting your money."
2,"""In the Tradition of Victoria Holt""","This wasn't really in the tradition of Victoria Holt, she was basically ripping off her ideas blatantly. The spelling and grammar mistakes were maddening. I absolutely LOVE Victoria Holt but I believe she would be disappointed in the attempt. The only reason I gave it two stars was that the main character, Elizabeth, was very likable. I wouldn't suggest purchasing the book, just read an old Victoria Holt."
2,A little disappointing,"Like other people, I was excited about reading this book since it was in ""the Tradition of Victoria Holt."" Yes, while it was similar to Victoria Holt's works, it doesn't come close in quality. The characters were flat and not really believable. The dialogue sounded forced and the plot was predictable. The typos were obvious and annoying, and frankly I expect better from a book. Having said that, the book is an okay read, but don't waste your money. Borrow it or buy a used copy."
1,terrible,"Out of tune, off key, racist. It's hard enough to believe that something this bad was recorded, let alone sold on Amazon. Just plain terrible."
4,mo cool smudge,"This is the first I have heard besides Tea, Toast, and Turmoil. Although not as solid throughout it is still an example of the kind of music that needs to be heard. There is not enough good rock music left, and with songs like Berlin Chair, Bill(courtesy of Fuzzy), Suckerpunch, and a couple of choice Desdendents covers I think rock music might still be alive even if they can only be found ""down under""."
3,It worked well before it broke,This worked well while it worked. I accidentally broke off the cable between the card and the antenna and found it could not be repaired easily as it was hard wired (soldered?
3,A must-have for every Mythbusters fan but way too expensive.,"I'm still surprised why they didn't include these pilots in the first season box but you should definitely own these 3 episodes if you're a Mythbusters fan.Content wise I'm rating this 5 stars. However, the price is way too high ($25.79 at the moment I'm writing this). You're paying more than half the price of a complete season box which contains 10 times as many episodes."
4,Its a memory chip,"Got it, installed it. No fuss what so ever. Worked right out of the box with no issues. Worth the 28 bucks."
1,not compatible,"this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670. when you put it in, it reads ""bad battery"" on the screen and will go no further."
1,This book needs help!,"This book seemed rather boring, unfactual, and a disgrace to our civil history. War is not a game it is not to be toyed with. Two children can not analize the out come of a war. This book was pathetic. I must say, God help me"
4,The book is great.I loved every word of it.,It was a great book i liked it a lot.I had to read this book for my summer reading last year.I give it four stars.I love to read books because i live in miami and theres nothing to do here.All people do here is pook.I would love to read another book like this
2,Could the book be anymore boring???,"I was assigned this book as a summer reading assignment for my AP English IV class. I can honestly say it is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was depressing and pointless from beginning to end!!! If you are assigned this book, and God knows why would you want to read it at free will, buy the ""Cliff Notes"". Besides, what kinda of a name is Phineas anyway???"
2,Well written but puts me to sleep.,"I think that James Knowles did a wonderful job of writing this novel, but it PUTS ME TO SLEEP. I had to read this book of a twisted friendship for English class, and hated every minute of it. I sugguest you read a diffrent book."
3,A sub-par book with weak imagery and symbols,The symbolic references in this novel are weak and not well developed. The characters were strong and well developed over the course of the story. The backdrop of war was used effectively to portray the personal struggles between Gene and Finny. The war that goes on between these two characters is rooted the war that is taking place in Europe. The war changed these two characters. Finny can be said to have ultimatly died from the war itself. War mentality led Brinker to have mock trial.Finny realizes the true nature of the world. Finny lives in an ideal world and cannot survive in the real world of hate and conflict.
5,One of the best books I've ever read. Deeply moving.,"I read A Separate Peace when I was in eigth grade. It touched me then, and now -- nearly twenty years later -- it is still one of my annual reads. The characters of Gene and Phineas are so well-developed that you feel you know these two boys and the special relationship they share. Despite the terrible thing Gene does to Finny, it is virtually impossible to dislike Gene, just as it is impossible to dislike Finny. If you're looking for cars exploding, guns blazing, and curse words every other page, the book is not for you. However, if you're trying to take a realistic peek into the workings of the adolescent male mind in 1942, then you would not want to miss this book. It is truly tragic, and I recall twenty years ago that when I read the words, ""Your friend is dead"" from the novel, I had to put it down and did not read the last few pages for nearly two weeks. It's a sensitive subject addressed in a sensitive manner."
3,"cheap and useful, but with some design flaws","I travel a lot, and so I wanted an alarm clock that is small and rugged. This clock gets the job done.Pros:- 24 hr time, so you don't set the wrong alarm time- easy to read display with large numbers- date day and even thermometer! degrees C and F!Cons:- $$$ for this thing? buy something at a locally instead!- have to remove the battery cover to set alarm time- flip cover is weak at the hinges, I broke mine."
2,Difficult to use,"I purchased this alarm clock, but am not very happy with it. The display is great and it rings loudly, but my biggest complaint is that in order to set the alarm (time or on/off switch) I must take off the battery cover."
4,"Its great, but !","This is a great product and perfect for who takes many tablets not more than twice daily, which means each color for different time , i ordered two sets so that i can use it for 2 weeks BUT UNFORTUNATELY i recieved 3 violet and one blue, so the product there is no complain about it, but it is the company problem if they send you two packs with SAME COLOR !!!!!!"
2,BB Set All-Year Calendar a little misleading...,"It was the concept of this calendar that caused me to purchase it. I was looking for a way to teach my three year old son the concept of time as well as holidays and many other things. The calendar description indicated that the calendar was reuseable, but it really wasn't, at least not without having it laminted first. It is made of paper so without having it laminated you couldn't write on it from month to month. The dates would have to be taped, stapled or velcroed on each month. Also, the numbers are so large they wouldn't leave any room for additional notes. This item would really only be appropriate/useful in a school type setting."
5,A must have for rose pruning,"These gloves effectively keep thorns from poking; you can pick up a rose branch and bend it over with these gloves and not feel the thorns at all. Even though they are poke proof, the gloves do not hinder dexterity."
2,Not really thorn proof at all :(,"I was hoping for big things from these gloves, but they aren't any more thorn proof than the basic single skinned leather gloves you can get from Home Depot. Its nice that they have a longer cuff on them, but I was looking for something with more thorn resistance than they deliver :("
3,Okay movie,"This movie was not the best, but it was good. The evil guy is hilarious with his somewhat euphoria of laughter. Of course, it is a copy of Bruce Lee's movie, Enter the Dragon. I liked it. My suggestion is to rent it, though it may be hard to find. Anyway, enjoy!"
5,An excellent compendium of information...,"This is quite an excellent compilation of information, support, and permission to help you on your journey to becoming the woman you want to be.Shaevitz covers every area of life with plenty of suggestions, so this is not just a theoretical book, but a very pragmatic one.Her style is clear and easy to read.As a self-help reference guide it might be something you come back to when you have lost your way. A spark to ignite you toward authenticity, wholeness, and peace."
2,Sounds depressing,I didn't really care too much for this album...sounded too depressing. I like more of the uptempo style of music.
4,Great Item,"My family has used this very thing for years. When we finally wore it out, we replaced it with a new one that is exactly the same. We like it a lot."
4,"Good Value, Works As Advertised","Pros: Have used for 1 month and had no problems, it does everything that I wanted it to do, and it's light and portable. The basket that lowers with the lid closed is a great feature. For the small quantities that I cook at a time, it does everything perfectly. I'm very well pleased with it, and have already recommended it to some of my family members.Cons: If it has an On/Off switch I haven't found it, so it makes a slight pop when you plug it into the outlet, because it's always ""On"". Could use a switch. Overall, I rate it very good."
2,Don't Purchase,"I had to replace my previous deep fryer & could not find similar so I went with this. What a mistake. I keep hoping it will die to justify purchasing another. When I push in button to open lid the entire unit will kick back as the lid FLIES (yes I meant to put it in caps) open with a hard SNAP. Imagine the first time I did this with the grease having been heated to 375. Scared me and I now hold the unit when I open the lid. My prior fryer had a time which was a great safety feature as it would turn itself off. Ladybugmom, Karen"
1,Too cool,This product worked well the first couple of times used. After that the temperature does not reach the maximum temperature again. Big disapointment.
3,Presto CoolDaddy Electric Deep Fryer,This deep fryer is ok. It gets the job done but after a while you will see that it is very hard to clean up and to keep clean. I got this fryer at Kmart for about 30 bucks. If you are looking for something that will just get the job done then this is for you but as far as cleaning it this thing starts to smell after a while of old oil. And by the way it takes up a lot of space in your cabinets. I prefer something easier to clean that does not take up a lot of space.
4,Performs better than expected,"This deep fryer works very well. It does not require a lot of oil, so it is also economical in that respect. It heats up quickly and the heat is constant and even. I find that it is very easy to clean and keeps the surrounding area clear of messy oil splatters. My only complaint is that it does not have an on and off switch. This is a big problem for me because I do not like to touch plugs anyway and in this appliance I must to shut it off. So 4 stars instead of 5. On performance I can highly recommend this product.UPDATE: January 7, 2013 - It has now been three years since I purchased this and I just wanted to post that it is still working perfectly and has proven reliable."
4,Presto Cool Daddy is Hot,"This little unit looks good on the counter and works even better. The only shortcoming I found is the lack of an ""off"" position on the dial temperature control. The user must disconnect the unit from the outlet or at the back of the unit when finished with the cooking. How difficult can it be to add an off position to the dial controller? I selected 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this one less than 8 mths ago and it has been gradually losing its heat. It worked great at first and was easily one of our best fryers but slowly the chips ( french fries to the Americans) wouldn't cook quickly and now when you finally remove them from the fryer, ages after putting them in , they are very unpleasant to eat, hard , not browned and just not nice. Now looking to replace it with something else and reading reviews on other fryers."
2,The Basket and handle rusted after 1 wash,I washed the basket and handle with dishwashing soap and the next day there were rust spots in a couple of areas on the metal parts. I don't know if I got a defective product or if I wasn't suppose to wash it with soap (the manual didn't say) but it seems a little cheap that the basket would rust so easily. I hadn't even used it for frying yet either so I would not recommend this product since it may rust before even the first use...
2,Great if you only cook for one person,"I'm writing this review as my fries get cold. Fries and fish filets that say ""1-3 minutes in deep fryer"" cooked for 10 minutes. Now, I'm waiting for my 15 shrimp, also indicated to cook for 3 minutes, after 10 minutes. Fries and 2 filets (cooked together) are now lukewarm, shrimp are not brown. It doesn't fry nearly hot enough to cook foods in the time listed on the labels. Perhaps if you could put every item together in one batch it would be OK, but it doesn't hold enough to feed two - and we are two small, thin people. Very disappointed that the oil doesn't get that hot. There is no way it gets to the 375 advertised - most cooking times are for 400 degrees, and they're not a LITTLE bit more. Just finished cooking 5 minutes worth of food in about 30 minutes."
1,a lousy fryer,I received this as a christmas gift from my granddaughter - the first time I used it - it burned everything - the second time I tried to use it and nothering happened. Today I tried again and nothing - a worthless piece of junk - light enough for the ants to carry off.
1,cool daddy fryer,"Yhis is the worst deep fryer I have ever owned. Our chicien stuck to the basket so badly we had to thow it away, and get iut oiur $20,00 fry daddy, I woukld never recommend this fryer to anyone. .I am a senior citizen and I usually do not complain, but this was terrible when I had company dor dinner and it took 2 hours"
5,Works very well!,"I bought this deep fryer over three years ago, and am as pleased with it now as I was when I bought it.The oil heats quickly and stays hot, the sides of the fryer get a little warm when in use but that is to be expected. The fryer is a good size, not too big and not too small. If you were going to do a full fish fry dinner for a family of four I would reccomend a bigger one or buying two of them. When I first received the fryer I used it once and then it would not work again, I sent an e-mail to amazon, they sent me a new one and picked-up the old one, no fuss no muss. You couldn't have asked for better customer service. This fryer gets used at least twelve times a year and works great."
3,Presto Cool Daddy,"I like this frier, its a nice size and its easy to use, it cooks the food well. The only complaint I have is that is easy to burn yourself using it. The part that holds the greese sits ontop of the Frier and its exposed and easy to hit when youre stiring up the food so it doesnt stick to the basket. There should be something plsatic that it sits in or something. I have brunt myself three times. One big burn on my arm and two smaller ones on my hands using it."
1,Returning the item,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He has used it once and we are planning to return it. The handle gets hot. When you lower the basket into the oil it causes the steam to escape from around the handle..thus causing my husband a burn two of his fingers. As far as function, per my hubby, it worked alright and he liked the adjustable heat."
2,revere2008,the fryer not two badit is frying goodbut take lot of oiland that is not economic for the budgetI am not really recommended it for others
1,fryless,"I bought this and what a piece of CRAP!!!! It's cheap,flimsy and food dropped in gets the oil cold and it comes out soggy and takes forever to reheat..Trust me when I say,before you throw you're money away,give it to charity. This is the worst deepfryer I have Ever owned!!!"
2,Still smells like grease! but cooks well.,"I purchased this after I owned the fry daddy. The fry daddy left a greasy residue on my countertop, so I gave it away and purchased this. I wiped it out today and let it preheat. During the preheat time, it started to smell like old grease or hay in a barn, it was terrible. I still cooked my food in it, and it tasted just fine, but 4 hours later, my house still smells. I'm fairly disappointed."
1,Cool Daddy leaves me COLD,"Right out of the box, the Presto Cool Daddy failed to heat up the oil sufficiently to properly fry potatoes. I checked the oil temp on the max setting with a candy thermometer and a deep fry probe. Both agreed that instead of the 375 degrees called for, the hottest the oil would heat was 320 degrees F. Additionally, the spring on the lid is taut enough that, even with the weight of an oil load in the tank, if you don't guard the lid from springing open, it will splash (hot enough) oil to cause a real hazard. This unit went straight back to the store. I replaced it with an Oster (Oster CKSTDFZM70 4-Liter Cool Touch Deep Fryer, Black and Stainless Steel) that does a crackerjack job. If anyone knows how to rate a product with no stars, let me know."
3,Fries Fries Alright,"This is a very small fryer suitable for one or two people. I would rate it higher except for two minor complaints.First, the lid does not quite seal properly. After dropping the food in the oil, I have to sort of jiggle the lid into place. Second, and this could be a biggie, the mechanism that holds the basket in the ""up"" position is a bit flimsy and doesn't always catch right. If you aren't careful, you could literally drop the basket into the hot oil and burn yourself badly.You should, however, have the lid shut. Four stars for performance, three stars for quality."
5,Neat,A must have for frying. Just the right size for us. Has safety features and easy to use. Would recommend.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Just like the other reviewers I found the highest temp it reaches is 340 degrees - not exactly what I wanted but for my limited use it was okay UNTIL after having it for about a month and using it only a few times it just stopped working. I called customer service and after trying to troubleshoot it they told me to mail the unit back - I paid almost $20 to mail it and, even though it was clearly a defective product, Presto will not compensate me for the cost to ship it. When I had to return a product during the warrantee period to another manufacturer they sent me a mailing label to use. I had to agree that if they found the ""issue"" to be through my neglect or error I would compensate them for all the shipping costs. That was and is fair. DO NOT BUY FROM PRESTO!"
2,"It's OK, but heat level is not sufficient",We bought this about a year ago to replace one that was dying.It worked quite well for the first month but then the level of heat started dropping off.Now it just never heats up enough to get the job done.It isn't even as good as the one we threw away a year ago.I think I will look for a different brand this time.
2,Power Yoga That's Hard to Follow,"I've watched a lot of yoga videos, and while I'm a fan of Denise Austin, this isn't her best effort. When you're in down dog, you're not looking at the screen, so you NEED someone explaining what position is coming up next or, at the very least, where your feet and hands need to be headed. And this video fails to give good directions. I had a VERY tough time following it, so i've pretty much shelved it and gone back to Baron Baptiste for yoga and Denise for stretching and pilates."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"This is the worst workout DVD I've ever seen! There is an almost total lack of instruction, and she only holds the poses and stretches for literally two seconds. I own a lot of workout DVD's and although some are kind of lame I still use them because they have some redeeming value. I wasn't even able to modify this workout, such as holding the poses longer, because she rushes through everything so quickly I got behind in a few seconds. I can see this DVD perhaps being appropriate for someone who has NEVER exercised or who is recovering from a major accident, but if you are not in this group do not even consider wasting your money on this ""workout."""
4,Good workout to get you started,"Denise's Power Yoga Plus is a good workout for people who wants to get in shape. The workout is not too difficult, but it forces you to exercise the major groups of muscle of the body. And if you stay with it, you will see results.Denise showed us many moves in this workout, a little bit too fast for a Yoga routine. This is not surprising, as Denise is very good with Pilates."
1,This video sucks,"Please do not buy it and waste your money like me. I tried to return it but couldn't. The first part is all advertisements of herself. Then the power yoga is 20 minutes and moves so fast from one phase to the other that you don't even know what happened (opposed of what power yoga is all about). She holds every position for 1/10 of a second and that's it.It's better to buy a yoga or pilates video made by yoga and pilates instructors (the one with Ali Mcgraw as participant and Eric Schiffman as instructor is fantastic).She keeps repeating these peppy phrases all the time which is something you do not do in Yoga, it's about relaxation not being pepped up. She is a total waste of time."
2,"Bad Yoga, good Pilates","Though I'm generally a fan of Denise Austin videos, she was less than great on this one. She doesn't thoroughly explain the moves she is doing and runs through each excercise too quickly to actually do any good. However, the Pilates section of the tape, after the Yoga, was a pretty good workout and good introduction to Pilates. Overall, though, not worth the investment."
1,Buy this if you like advertisements of her products,"If you want any good Yoga video or Pilates buy one from Known yoga and pilates instructures not from someone who is vernturing to those in order to make more money. The video starts off by a lot of advertisements of her products. Once the actual exercies finally started, although the power yoga moves did get my heart beat up, they went too fast from one step to the next and anyone with even a bit of familiarity with Yoga knows that (except for sun salutations) you are supposed to hold your moves for a few seconds or minutes to get the real benefit (which is what power yoga is all about). Her moves were too fast and no yoga benefits in stretching for 2 seconds at a time.I tried to return this video since it was such a waste but couldn't.The Ali Mcgraw Yoga Video is the best out there if you want a good yoga workout (she is a participant and Eric Schiffman is the instructor)."
5,Power Yoga Plus,"I just love this video...I have lots of classical yoga tapes but this one is my favorite. Why? Not only do I feel great afterwards but I feel good immediately into this workout. Each stretch feels meaningful and has an impact. I also love the flow of her yoga and how she does ""functional yoga"" where she moves within a pose. This may not be classical yoga but it feels wonderful. If anyone out there knows of other ""functional yoga"" tapes, let me know because I love this style. This tape has the added benefit of being broken up into two sections, so you can do either one section or do them both if you have time. This tape is very time efficient, no ultra long pauses for mediation, just flowing yoga.I think others are critical of this tape because Denise is pretty and blond and they have a hard time taking her as a serious yoga practitioner. But I find her nice and warm and a fine exercise instructor."
3,Not really Yoga,"""Power Yoga Plus"" by Denise Austin is not really yoga. It has two workouts: the first workout is called ""Power Yoga"" and the second one is ""Power Pilates"". Each part is about 20 minutes with an introduction at the beginning. I find the power yoga part to be fast as Denise does not allow enough time for the pose to sink in. She barely gives instructions before each pose, making it hard to follow. She does not give modifications for each poses either. The pilates part is quite similar to that in the Mat workout based on JH Pilates. And again she does not give instructions before poses. I would suggest you to get Gaiam's ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" by Suzanne Deason. In the DVD, you can choose the options to have modified poses and different instructors. For Pilates, my suggestion is Winsor Pilates because Marie Winsor explains better."
3,Not the real thing,"I bought this DVD at a store because it was on sale. Although I think the workout itself is good it doesn't have the feel of a yoga video. I find Denise's voice to be quite annoying during the workout, not soothing. She may be a good aerobics instructor but for Yoga stick to the professionals. I like Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning for weight loss. I have not gotten tired of her video like I have with Denise Austin's."
1,Want yoga...avoid Denise,"I received this video for Xmas. Not a fan of Denise Austin, but thought there might be some value in viewing the video. The Yoga section was laughable. The Pilates section was just OK. Denise moved through the moves quickly and eliminated good instruction. Denise needs to partner up with a Yoga and Pilates instructor. Better yet...avoid instructing something she does not understand."
1,Save your money,"This tape was so disappointing that I felt compelled to write this review -- Denise may be a great fitness guru in other areas, but yoga is not one of them. I totally agree with the other reviewer who felt that Denise Austin doesn't ""get"" yoga. She takes you through the movements as if it were just a stretch class without focusing on breathing and the healing effects of yoga. It was as if she took a 5 minute course on yoga before taping the video. The other reviewers said the pilates section was great, but to tell you the truth, I turned off the tape in disgust before I got to the pilates part. I enjoy the ""Yoga Zone"" tapes a great deal -- great workouts for beginner through advanced. They don't spend a lot of time on scenery and stuff, but the instructors are terrific."
2,It's okay,"I expected more from this dvd. This workout is fast paced (not for a beginner) with very little detail of movement and technique. I recommend ""Yoga for Weight Loss Conditioning""-- a more comprehensive workout with a great instructor."
5,Only Video I've Ever Done Consistently,"I'm one of those people who works out only occasionally. The New Year's Resolution type. I really don't like excercising in the traditional sense--running, walking, aerobics videos, etc. But a few years back, I realized I had to lose some weight. I began walking on my treadmill--boring!--and this video. With Denise's positive encouragement, and upbeat yoga, I was able to consistenly workout. I would do the yoga video one day and the pilates the next. I actually began to experience that workout ""high"" that you hear of. I guess. What I mean is, if I skipped a workout, I missed it. I wished I'd done it. With diet, I managed to reach my target weight before my second pregnancy. Now I'm expecting a third and shopping for a pregnancy workout I'd enjoy just as much."
1,don't waste your money,"The problems with this workout are:1. She goes from pose to pose quickly without explaining how to do the pose correctly. She is assuming that you already know the poses2. If you know enough yoga to know the poses she does, the workout will most likely be too easy for you3. I couldn't be serious about the workout because I was laughing too hard at her commentary (""let me see your smiling face!"")So, it's not good for beginners or for more experienced yoga practitioners, either. Don't buy it."
1,Boring,"I've done some bad yoga videos but this has been the absolute worst so far. The instructors voice is really, really annoying and the flowing poses are done way too slow. They're supposed to generate power and stamina but the only thing they did for me was bore me to tears. I wouldn't even recommend this to a beginner."
3,great for quick workouts!,"true, this workout is very low impact, and doesn't wear you out, but having a one year old running around, it's great on those days that i just can't get her to take a long enough nap for me to exercise. the workouts are divided up into pilates, and yoga, and really do give a good stretch, so you at least feel like you did do some exercise. not much good at hitting those target spots, but a good stretch!"
2,I wish I were deaf too...,"I don't know what possessed me to get this DVD. I wished I'd read some of your reviews. I should've known better since I faintly remember Denise Austin's voice in some TV programs and found it grating at the time. The minute she started speaking in this video, those memories came flooding back :( Her yoga moves are quite basic. Pilates moves are OK, but to echo one reviewer, she doesn't transition very well between the poses. I bought this video 3 months ago and have used it only once. I guess I should use it at least a few more times to get my money's worth - but I wonder if I can keep it on mute and put my Enya CD in or something..."
1,Not real yoga,"Received this as a gift so I tried it out. I have done lots of yoga, and this is most definitely NOT yoga! The traditional poses are modified in ways that oppose what yoga tries to achieve. More importantly, Austin does not explain how to get into the poses in any way that would be understandable to a beginner. She talks too much. Given the chatter and the lack of yoga flow, this doesn't feel like yoga at all. It may be appealing to some, but I give it only 1 star because of the poor instruction. I would suggest trying videos by yoga experts rather than by fitness ""experts""."
3,A Little slow,"This video is good for a yoga beginner, because I did not really find it very ""powerful"". It did not really get my heart rate up."
2,Please Be Quiet Denise!,"I have always found Denise Austin's voice to be irritating but I have endured it through her workouts because they are effective. She has a tendency in this workout, as always, to let her mouth keep running to fill the silence during poses; what a mistake. Half the time what she is saying doesn't even make sense and I find myself stopping to laugh. She looks great though, whatever she is doing works for her!"
1,Not Worth It,"Having practiced Yoga off and on for several years, I expected much more from this DVD. Barely broke a sweat and there was NO emphasis on breathing. None of the poses were held for more than a few seconds. There were no cues on which poses were coming up, so I felt two steps behind the entire time. The worst part though, by far, is Denise Austen's terribly cheesy ""yogi voice"" that she put on throughout the workout. ""Feel the benefits..."" ""Listen to your inner voice..."" UGH! Hate that! It is actually distracting."
2,Denise Austin's' Mat Workout is better!,"I first bought Denise Austin's Mat Workout about a year ago and got great results. So when the DVD broke, I came back to buy another one from Amazon and saw that she had another yoga DVD. Figuring how great the Mat Workout was, I had no qualms about purchasing the Power Yoga Plus. What a disappointment! The workout was way too fast to be effective and each 20 minute section was punctuated by her annoying commentaries on how great yoga and pilates is. They should have used the extra space to make the workouts longer. Echoing the other reviewers, the background music was great and along with the color scheme was an improvement from the Mat Workout. I also liked that she had a ""glossary"" of the different moves that she uses in the DVD. Unfortunately these points don't make up for the disappointing workouts. If there will be another edition, please SLOW DOWN and focus less on the ""fluidity"" of the movements and more on the intricacies of each move."
3,Not the greatest,"This video is definately not one I would recommend. Because it's main focus is to make a short exercise session, there is no explaining of HOW to do the moves, not to mention that the moves are only held for a few seconds, not long enough to be thouroughly effective. Denise is talking throughout the duration of both the yoga and pilates sections, and therefor she doesnt focus on correct breathing. Her talking is also somewhat disruptive if you're trying to just calm yourself and get into a stress free mood. My advice would be to, perhaps,get a video done by a well known YOGA expert who will explain HOW to do the moves properly, breath properly, and who will hold out the poses longer."
4,Not really Yoga,"I like Denise Austin and find her encouraging in her videos. However, the title of this video is deceptive. I bought it expecting to get more yoga out of it. The stretches are very basic and the second part of the video is pilates. I was looking more for a yoga video that was soothing and more meditative.On the positive side, I like to do the stretching part after a good run to cool down. working out to the entire video may give the beginner a decent work out."
4,A great workout,"I recently received this DVD as a gift and am really enjoying it. The poses are fairly basic, but can be made easier or more difficult by modifying. Denise is chatty, and other reviewers have complained about that, but I find that her constant reminders to stand up straight or hold in your abs makes me more aware of what I'm doing and improves my workout. I have a hip injury I've been working on, and the stretches and hip exercises in both programs have helped a lot. All in all, I'd recommend it to just about anyone."
3,A teaser for yoga and pilates,I do not have yoga or pilates experience. I am a fairly fit person and found the first yoga section to not be enough. I did however enjoy the pilates section of the tape. Enough to get me very interested in finding more pilates work out tapes. I really felt like I had a good work out with out jumping and bouncing all over the place. I do have to say that I was a bit disappointed that the moves go so quickly and you do not have much of a chance to hold the moves and really feel a deep strength training. I will continue to use this tape in my regular work out routine but I am also looking for some videos more dedicated to really teaching yoga and pilates.
2,Not real Yoga.,"If you are into a true Yoga form such as Iyengar, you probably won't like this video. It is very fast , doesn't hold poses for longer that a second or two and does absolutly nothing for your mind. I personally think Iyengar is far more difficult and requires more strength and flexibility than this speedy version. However the Pilates portion of the tape I did enjoy."
1,Could it get any worse?,"Wow, take a program that had some decent features and screw it up. If you don't compress and reindex MINIMUM once a day this thing actually loses info as you type it in! We have close to 7,000 contacts. I called regarding the losing of info and was advised ""the program wasn't designed for holding that many contacts"". Hello! It's a contact database! If this isn't designed for holding thousands of contacts what are they doing selling it as a contact database? We use it because we must as we use ACT on a daily basis and can't go without it at all. We put all our (abbreviated) conversations in the notes section so it's vital to our business. But, if another product comes along that will make the transition smooth, fast and easy we'll go for it. Or if those ever-changing software manufacturers of ACT get it together and make a version that can actually hold and KEEP info we'll go with that but so far that hasn't happened. My recommendation? Use Outlook."
3,"IT'S A ""DOG EAT DOG"" WORLD!!!!!!!!!!","A WONDERFUL COPY OF A CULT, FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!! JAYNIE IS AT HER BEST, JUST CHEWING UP THE SCENERY!!!! THE MUSIC, BY CARLO SAVINA, IS A CULT CLASSIC ALSO!!!!"
5,Review of The Ancient Mysteries Sourcebook,"The book is informative and well presented. It was required reading for a Masters Class, and it augmented the other required reading, as well as the classroom information. The author writes commentary on the background of the mystery, and then the sacred text."
1,Crashed more than 3 times!,"I have had three of these drives and all three have gone bad. The first I used for approx. 5-6 days before it stopped working. It would light once, then shut off and the drive would start making a clicking sound. I got a replacement from Seagate and that lasted about 2 hours! I sent that one back as well and thought that I'd do it one more time before demanding a refund, well this one worked, sort of... I have been using it for 8-9 Months now with extremely good care and the day before a one of my school finnals papers are due, it crashes AGAIN!I don't have anything against Seagate. I love there products actually, I got a 160 GB Seagate FreeAgent Go and it is wonderful. Hardware, software, Everything, but when it comes to this Seagate Pocket Drive, I would recommend anyone who doesn't want to loose their data, to steer away from this product. There are much better options to go with now days."
4,Easy to use pocket hard drive with huge appetite (storage space),"As a frequent user of pocket hard drives for the past few years, I am always on the lookout for easy-to-use pocket hard drives. My job function requires heavy transfers of audio and video data. Compared to the past pocket drives I have used, this has huge capacity (5 GB) that comes really handy as the file sizes are growing by leaps and bounds. This pocket drive comes with many utilities that are nifty. Unlike my previous pocket drives, this one has a clearly visible blue activity indicator light that is pleasant. This pocket drive scores points in every aspect except one - it's unwieldly design. It is little bit heavy compared to other pocket drives and that's the reason I did not give five stars for this product. All in all, this is an excellent product that serves ever-growing capacity needs of every computer enthusiast."
5,Great portable storage device,"For this price (currently $39.99 on sale), you will not find a better portable hard drive at 5.0gb. I use it on both my windows and linux systems.As an added bonus, the include software allows you to easily create a password protected partition on the device.The drive is very small, about the size of a UMD disk.Not much more to say. At this price, it's a great deal."
2,"Good, but not good enough","I bought this and it works. While a typical USB Flash will take 30 minutes (or more) to transfer a 1 gig file, this Seagate can do it in 4 minutes or less.The only downside to the Seagate is that it hesitates and does nothing periodically. I don't know if it is waiting for the drive to spin or struggling with seeking the data but it can be frustrating.Using this with the USB drive on my Philips DVP5960 DVD player is usually convenient. However, it can take forever and a day to fast-forward. It is easier to let the video play at regular speed, set an alarm (for example, 20 minutes), walk away, and come back to watch after the alarm has beeped.The Sandisk Cruzer Micro can be had in 4 gig size and can also transfer a 1 gig file in 4 minutes or less. I have the 2 gig version and it never has the pause problem. The 4 gig Sandisk Cruzer Micro will cost you more than this Seagate but it won't hesitate and it will probably be more durable."
5,What more can you ask for...?,"I had already researched the Seagate 5.0 GB at Amazon for $89.95 when I happen to see the 6.0 GB at Sam's Club for $99.95. Plug and Play worked fine. I needed a larger device than a floppy to transfer data from work to home and vice versa, as well as photos to other family computers. I took one of the other reviewers ideas and store it in an Altoids can. Even though it is pocketable it is a hard drive with delicate insides, I suspect some of the one star reviews are due to it being treated like flash memory. It has two big advantage over flash - it is large enough not to be easily lost and the capacity is great.Note: When you first plug it in to USB you get a popup screen that offers music and photo album selections. If you just want to store data, hold down the Shift key when you plug in and keep the key down until after the drive lights on its first initialization then release: No popup screen."
4,Hockey Puck Flash Drive,"Good idea for someone who takes back up files along in a brief case pocket, but otherwise this drive is bulky. I had some conflict issues with the software not being compatible with my computer. I never had issues with software for my SanDisk thumb drive. If it were up to me, I would just buy flash drives with no software or driver. Keep it simple."
2,Quit working,"This was a wonderful device until it quit working. It lasted for two or three months before just giving up one day. On the other hand, my father-in-law bought one that is still going perfectly. Just make sure to keep your reciept, etc., in case you get a bad one."
4,nice...,"i got this as a gift, and that time it was $150. so it wasnt really value for money but 5 gigs is quite a lot of space for a portable drive"
2,"Wonderful drive, if it only lasted","I loved my little Seagate 5.0GB drive, even after the first one crashed and burned. But the second time, I cannot forgive. I carried it everywhere in my pocket, and maybe that was part of the problem, but if it can't handle that then it is no good to me. Solid state memory, here I come."
1,Buy an HP,"I would not recommend Epson printers. I have an r200 and it frequently runs out of ink when the ink cartridges are not empty.In addition to the ""empty"" cartridges, the printer will not print until you install a full new cartridge. So if you want to print a text document in black ink, the printer will not work until you purchase the new cyan cartridge.And lastly, Epson doesn't recycle their ink cartridges as does HP."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is a horrible printer. Not only does it take up tons of color and black and white ink every time it prints (it does ""test prints"" on all cartridges every time so even if you only want black and white you're paying for color), it has lousy performance on printing pictures and has frequent multi-feed errors on standard paper. Epson photo paper doesn't work with it - it does bad lines through all photos and won't print without borders - and you'll have enormous amounts of trouble trying to get Epson to say what kinds of paper will. I will definitely not buy another printer by this comapny; it's too unreliable and wastes too much ink."
1,Ink rip off!,"It's great that you can print on a CD/DVD, but that's all I can say nice about this printer.Ink cost as much as the printer itself!Let's say you run out of ink and decide to purchase only black ink, this way you can at least print some text documents... WRONG!The printer will not print anything if one of your inks are low, or empty.My suggestion is not to ever buy an Epson printer. A made a huge mistake and bought two thinking they were great. Now I have two new non-working printers that will cost the better part of $160. in ink."
5,Perfect for printing digital photos!,"I got this printer along with a digital camera for my birthday from my husband. I was not very excited, as I had never seen an affordable printer that looked like pictures from the photo lab. I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that this printer prints great pictures! It has lots of features, date, border or no border, different sizes and medias. I highly recommend this printer!"
2,"Good printer for 3 years, then kaput","This worked fine for me for three years. I found that it does not work well with other ink brands and if you do not print for a week or two, it will clog. No problem-- a clean or two and it is back to normal. However, for the price, it should last more than three years. I spoke with Epson and they said it is broken (all it does is sit on my desk) and has to be repaired, but the repair will cost more than the cost of a new printer. I am not impressed. $400+ printers should last for more than three years."
5,Great Printer!,"I love this little printer, it is the second one of it's type I have purchased. It prints bright vibrant colors which is important since I design greeting cards. Super simple to use. Can print on all types of paper."
2,Unfortunately This Thing Inhales Ink,"I replaced an HP 722 with this printer because a friend was very enthusiastic about the the quality of the printing. The quality is very good but I am truly amazed at how much ink the printer uses, even for day-to-day mundane printing. I use this printer mostly for spreadsheets and word documents. Most have some color but not much. The ink just disappears.I'm hooking the HP back up and will use the Epson only when print quality is a serious concern of mine,"
2,Frustrating ink guzzler,"The printer worked pretty good while I used it often, but when I used it less frequently the problems started to mount - namely with the ink situation. It started to give the ""ink out"" messages even though the ink was not out in all the cartridges. And, even if I just had a full black in cartridge and another one was ""low"" it would not print in black only either. Very frustrating (and expensive to buy ink). We tried cleaning it and still doesn't want to print. It won't print if it senses that any cartridges are ""out of ink""(even though they aren't). I just don't understand how it says you're ""out of ink"" and won't print when I know that is not true. What an expensive machine this is to run- and a frustrating one. Won't buy Epson again."
1,not for OSX users who want to print cds,"I bought this printer specifically for the printable CD utility and it has been nothing but trouble from the outset. It makes marks all over the printable media and will only print one at a time before spitting it out and needing to be turned off and on again before settling down. I have had a replacement unit from Epson and spent countless hours on the phone with them but it still hasn't solved my problem. Now they want me to go 50 miles to a service center so they can test it on a PC (I have a mac) before they tell me that it is a fault with my computer, but I am just going to bag my $89 and not ever buy an Epson again. I think it might work okay with PC's but it just isn't working with OSX and this is what the Epson staff have also told me. Mac users, beware"
1,Epson Stylus R200 is Terrible for CD/DVD printing,"We have had the printer for almost a year and have yet to have a good printing experience on a CD or DVD. It jams, it flashes lights, it gets confused, we have to restart it/reset the tray and nudge it this way and that way, open and shut the lid, etc. Forget it. i'm sorry that we ever bought it and would not recommend it to anyone. We have been using it for printing demo DVDs for clients and you can kiss your Fedex deadline goodbye if you have to print at the last minute. Allow 20 minutes for playing with each disk. This machine is a disaster for that function."
2,Good luck aligning a CD for Printing,"As a basic injet printer this printer is fine. It takes quite a bit of work to get the image properly lined up for CD/DVD printing. The directions are not that well written regarding printing on CD's. This is the reason we bought the printer. I've been very happy with other Epson printers, but not this one."
1,Dies Quickly,"Don't buy this printer if you want to print more than 500 CDs in its lifetime. After about 250 CDs, the tray mechanism became impossible to deal with. The rollers would no longer pull the tray in on their own, so I ended up having to stand there and feed the tray through for every single CD. Then, when the printing was done, I'd have to manually pull the tray out myself, or the printer would go into reset mode and take 2 minutes to restart. This printer is a lemon, and I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it."
3,Yes and No: For Mac Users OS X Buggy,"As others have mentioned, the printer seems inconsistent.When it works, it prints great. It is good to be able to make CDs that are labelled well and look good so you can find things easily. The CDs look very good, the pictures are sharp and the color and saturation also looks good.The downside is that I could not get the printer to work consistently. No computer running OSX seemed to work properly, and OS 9 also had some issues, but I was able to get it work. And the replacement I received for the original printer also has the same issue, so there seems to be driver problems.As I said when it worked, it was great and definately worth the price, would have given it 5 stars. If you have an OS X only machine, be careful. I would guess Epson will figure this out. I have other Epson printers that work fine, and which I really like, and only got this one to print on CDs......"
5,Great quality and lower ink comsumption than you think!,"I just finished printing 100 4 x 6 photos for holiday cards. First of all, the photos were of very high quality at 5700 x 1440 dpi. Secondly, not one speck or splatter of ink is evident underneath the hood. Last, but not least, after 100 photos (highest quality setting on Kodak Ultimate Paper)the lowest color cartridge of the six is just under half full.I think printers are like computers. Every couple years you end up buying a new one. Technology gets better, features get better and the price continues to get lower. That said, for $90, this is a steal."
4,Great Deal,"I was was all set to buy a Canon (probably the i560) when I discovered this beauty. Decent speed, 6 individual ink tanks, cd/dvd printing... How could I say no? I've been using it for a week with no problems, and as someone who always feels a tinge of buyers remorse, I have none with this printer. My only question is how quickly the black tank may run out, but hopefully i won't find out for a while."
2,ink kills,"all the epson printers use the same ink.It really is water proof and fade resistant. I have had it in sun for over a year, no problemo. Same thing happens in the printer.Ink will eventually turn solid rendering the printer useless after about a year or so. Usually just after warranty period expires. Good luck. I only wish they could get this straight , but best thing is to just buy a new printer after the first set of cartridges you buy expire. SO buy printer, use until ink goes out and throw away entire printer, hopefully in the face of your local epson rep if you can find such an animal. Buy cheapest printer you can. more expensive models aren't any better, least not in inkjet land.Buy a REAL camera, cheaper to BUY FILM and DEVELOP than pay for ink, and quality better. Better living through chemistry, NOT electronics."
2,Not Good for printing on DVD's,I purchased this printer based on some of the previous recomendations in order to print titles directly on CD and DVD's.The only problem is that after printing on the disk the ink smudges - badly. Even after allowing 30 minutes to dry. It's basically an unuseable feature for this printer.Otherwise it seems to be a decent color printer.
2,Would be good if it were a product of quality...,"Basically, this printer sucks. I've had bad experiences with all Epson printers I've used, mainly that they print badly and have horrible software interfaces. The CD printing feature is almost impossible to get to work correctly - despite having made countless measurements and the such, each printed CD is offset in some way. It also usually takes two or three attempts to print a CD, as the error message ""CD/DVD Tray Not Set Correctly"" appears constantly. The Epson PrintCD software is horrible - it has very limited functions for making a good-looking CD label. And one can not merely select ""Print"" on the file menu to print it either - I must change the printer settings every time I attempt to print. The only reason this gets two stars is because printing directly onto a CD is better than using the CD stomper method, even though every label is offset."
1,Problematic printer,"I purchased this printer primarily to print on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs. The first R200 I received, wouldn't print on discs at all. Amazon quickly replaced it and new one does print on discs, however 75% of the time, the printer mechanism pushes the disc tray all the way out forcing me to reset the printer and re-position the disc tray to get it to print.Also, while printing a document on paper is very fast indeed, printing on a CD or DVD is very slow. Finally, Epson's ""Print CD"" software (Macintosh version) is clumsy and hard to use. Not recommended."
2,Don't buy this printer for basic office work,"This printer drinks ink like it's going out of style. I have to buy new black cartridges for it every single week and a full set of new color cartridges about every two weeks, despite the fact that all that I do 99 percent of the time is print black and white text documents. Economy grade is just light enough to be illegible; thus, one has to print using regular grade for every print job. Even when set to print using black and white only, the printer will refuse to print if any of the color ink cartridges are empty. Usually when a cartridge is ""empty,"" one can still hear ink sloshing around in it. I know that I don't just have a faulty model; my parents own the same printer and the behavior is exactly the same. This is also a very noisy printer."
5,Super CD/DVD printer....,"This gets six stars for CD/DVD printing. I purchased it for that alone. You can easilly print 100-200 CD's on one set of ink. By then the rollers may wear and the printer will have a problem ejecting the disc. No problem just pull it out a little while it is ejecting. When you are almost out of ink, call Epson warranty service and they will send you another printer with new ink cartridges! They even cover the shipping. For $99.00 or so, you can have a printer for a year with free ink!"
2,CD/DVD print is BS,"As a regular ink jet printer, it's fine...nothing special, but fine. I bought this specifically for the printing capability on CD's and DVD's. It worked for about 3 months until the tray crapped out. Then it wouldn't print at all and presented a paper jam error...I got Epson to replace my printer (after much debate) and bought three extra trays from epson (at $19 each!) and the new printer presented the same jam time after time. Now, I have a printer that will only print on paper. The CD/DVD tray is useless. I have spoken with many people who have this printer and they are experiencing the same issues. Epson refuses to admit the flaw. DON'T BUY IT FOR THIS ""FEATURE!"""
5,Well pleased,"Well pleased with all aspects of the printer. Very simple to download and operate, picture quality great as far as I'm concerned. Highly recommend for a low priced printer."
1,horrid experience,"printer itself would have been fine - as I found it here to replace mine of the very same make and model, seller misrepresented its working status... refund received but a bummer for sure"
5,Amazing,I will never go back to printing labels on CDs anymoreall the hassle.. labels... Printing... putting the labels on the cds.All i do now is slap the cd on the tray and hit print.The Ink itself is worth the printer.I was thinking of just buying it again when the ink runs outor trying generic ink..otherwise it is great!!!!
1,my last epson... promise!,"I had the stylus photo 820 before and it went bad in a couple months and started spitting ink onto the paper rollers, which ruined every page I printed. I swore I'd never buy another Epson, but the CD printing feature reeled me in and I tried out this R200 model. I have the same issues others are having: the tray does not load properly so you have to do it over and over. The ink is STILL spitting onto the rollers, just like my last Epson, so it ruins about 75% of the discs that go through. Oh, and what did Epson say when I described the problems I'm having within a month of buying it? ""Keep in mind this is a home consumer printer and has not been designed to perform bulk CD printing."" Okay, so normal home consumer use is to print 10 discs and never use it again - I haven't even changed the ink yet. This time I'm serious: I'll never buy another Epson."
1,Terrible Software,"I am totally fed up with this printer. It is very picky about feeding paper, installing ink cartridges, and pretty much only prints when it feels like printing. I am sick of having to turn it off/on to clear some bogus error that it thinks it is having to get it to print. This printer is a waste of my time, and I will not be replacing it with another Epson."
2,"nice quality, but has other downsides.","Good quality prints, no complaints there.What I hate is how in stores you HAVE to buy one ink catridge at a time. You can't buy the al in one packs in sotres anymore... And even online you have to buy the black separately.If you run out of color...you can't print black and white anymore, even if you check black ink only.Another problem is print speed...if you want to print a single page its really slow cause it has to do all these tasks and checks before it prints. I thought Epson would have improved on this since the old days but it seems they stil do the same stuff. It can take quite a while before the printer actually gets ready to do whatever its trying to do. Not at all like my old HP which would print immediately."
3,Lucy Kaplansky sounds too much like Suzanne Vega,"This is quality music, no doubt. However, it strikes me as being too similar to the original works of Suzanne Vega. So while it's a pleasant listen, I would recommend Ms. Vega first."
2,Started off good and faded real quick,"Wow! Initially, I thought this would be a 3 or 4 star album. It started off great and I really started to grove with it in my car. As I got around to the second album, I got more and more dissuaded. I ended up struggling to get through the second disk and eventually just listed to Disc 1."
4,Laredo tv western season 1 volume 2,I tried the first volume of laredo and was really glad I did....Peter Brown from the Lawman show was the reason I tried Laredo...but what really makes the series is Neville Brand who plays the older Texas ranger but to my amazement he does it in a very funny manner...Neville was best known for his role as Al Capone in the Untouchables...little did I or I bet anyone seeing this show will expect him to be so comedic...Great show especially shows with Neville Brand ...!!!
4,Laredo,"I absolutely LOVED this tv show when I was, um, a bit younger. Watching it was used as incentives by my parents for all kinds of things, school work, house work, home work, etc. I was a little leery of watching it again, but it's wonderful now, too. In fact, I understand some of the humor that went right over my head in years past. I do wonder at which juncture of his life William Smith was in while filming this series.Was he, even then, studying for his doctorate in Russian, perhaps writing his thesis between takes? I hope to buy the rest of the series as it becomes available."
4,"Best Laredo set so far, but incomplete","This set is great compared to earlier versions available, where the local station logo was always on corner of screen and quality was poor. I was disappointed that the theme song and opening credits was deleted. The theme song is only played on the menu screen. I looked forward to the opening with the cast introductions."
2,Very difficult to read,I am currently taking a medical ethics class at my university and find this book impossible to get through without forcing myself. The chapters are so dense that it takes for ever to read one chapter. That would be okay if it made perfect sense but even after spending a considerable amount of time reading it I still don't get the gist. I often look things up on the internet for a simpler explanation.
3,out dated,"It served its purpose for school, but was not up to date. Much of what I needed was not included in this addition."
1,required reading,"I needed this book for school. I never read it, but the teacher didn't know. I can say that it looked good sitting on my desk in class. And I got an A for the class."
1,Very Dissatisfied of services,I ordered a book that costed $80 and returned it back as refused and never received a refund. They were also slow at responding to my emails concerning this issue.
4,doc recommended,This product was recommended by my dermatologist. My skin is acne prone. Its not a miracle cream that the next day one turns into a beauty but I am never going to stop using it. Over last 2 years my skin is gorgeous never broke its more even than ever!
5,a fine product,"I have used m.d. forte products for years, and have been pleased with the results. It is odor free and feels light on the skin. Yet this product leaves the skin soft.Helen swift"
4,Extend Ladder,This ladder fits nicely into my work truck. It extends to exactly the height required. It is compact and seems to be durable.
4,Hubs is very happy with it!,"The ladder came just in time to decorate the house for the holidays! He is very happy1 So far, so good!"
1,"Difficult to close, not recommended",When fully extended the weight makes it impossible to move the latches and close it. So it must be lied down to close. Therefore it is a very expensive and heavy straight ladder.
5,well constructed compact ladder,product is well made and has safety features to avoid pinching your fingers when closing the ladder. Very sturdy and compact
3,Good Idea....Very Difficult,In the construction business for 45 years. I can raise a 30 foot ladder by myself and need help extending and retracting this one. Latches are difficult to push and raise at the same time. When closing the parts move too fast to get fingers out of the way completely. GREAT CONCEPT.... just needs refining.
4,"Great ladder, easy to carry and use.",I would suggest this ladder for anyone looking to get on top of 1-story roofs or other structures within 15 feet. It is very easy to carry and set up. It also stores nicely in the truck of my car. The ladder takes up much less room than a typical wood or metal ladder.
5,I like it,"I bought this to change the messsage on our reader board. The board is 12 feet to the bottom, and 16 feet to the top. I have only used once so far but I really like it. It was sturdy, easy to use, and light enough to carry across the parking lot. It went up easy, and retracting wasn't a problem either. The only con I can say is that it is not quite tall enough, but I knew that when I bought it. If you are looking for this type of ladder, get one, you will not regret it."
4,portable ladder,"Just a wonderful way to carry an extension ladder into my home (A frame), extend it painlessly and clean windows, change light bulbs, etc. Until now I had been carrying a 12' stepladder in, extending the sides with difficulty and climbing up. It is harder to carry, more difficult to set up and no more stable. A great addition to my tools. JBW"
3,Telescoping Ladder,"Thirty six pounds doesn't sound like much, but for an 80 year old trying to extend it isn't easy. This seems like a heavy duty ladder, but not for home use. I find it difficult to use for only 8-10 feet. If you extend it from the top section, then you have the lower portion still blocked. If you extend it from the bottom, you need to raise all that weight. Also not easy to retract since the weight binds the catches. On second thought, I'd give this item only two stars."
3,Xtend and Climb,Great ladder but a bit on the heavy side and you have to be carefull when you are collasping it back down to not loose a finger
4,a pleasure to read,"This book encompassed everything, no stereotypes were allowed to seep in and I loved that. A gamut of personalities were explored here and there were things about racial identity, about being Asian, sprinkled in here and there but that served only to add to these characters and in the exploration of their lives. The writing style was great, the author jumped from person to person but never let the reader lose sight of the larger picture and how each character's life flowed into anothers."
3,Entertaining..,"A good book written with intricate prose. Unforunately, as the book got nearer to the end, so did my understanding. It was confusing keeping up with the characters towards ending because the voices of the characters were interlaced too much with each other. But a great read otherwise.. Sure did leave me thinking.."
2,I use Dr. Cooper's book all the time.,"A fair discussion of the ecology and behavior of Pennsylvania's indigenous ichthyofauna. Nice distribution maps and an excellent taxonomic key for the genus Notropis. However, the fish in Dr. Cooper's old B&W photographs look like they were pickled too long."
5,Megamix from the king of freestyle.,"This is a perfect example of what a freestyle megamix should sound like, when i first heard it i was amazed at how well it was put together."
1,Cretinous Drivel,"This is utter drivel. I would as soon place a metric tonne of wombat's diarrhoea on my turntable (or indeed stuffed up the usb connector of an MP3 player with a nano-tube sized syringe)as listen to this slavering pile of purulent ejecta from a boil on a monkey's gonad. The ""singer,"" Nicky Tesco (can that really be his real name?)sounds more dated than a soiled packet of Green Shield stamps being shoved up Jimmy Savile alimentary canal from the tradesman's entrance. The entire oeuvre sounds more like an arthritic weasel with its todger being turned on a serrated centre-lathe with white-hot tweezers.Mr Tesco has however perhaps given us a valuable historical insight into the sound that King Edward II must have made during the period of his unfortunate demise at Pontefract Castle. One can only hope that a similar fate will overtake the egregious Mr Tesco in the very near future."
4,"Only 1, although picture shows 2 and although description plural","Item sent, received as expected. The picture shows 2, the description says 'scalpel handles' - which is highly misleading.I opened the package expecting to receive the #3 and #4 in the picture, and only #3 was present.I then went online to discover others had the same problem, the company ""accidentally"" both pluralized the item and showed a picture of 2 items (implying 2 items would be sent)."
1,It is not usable. Extremely bad quality.,"This handle is completely not usable. The is not made properly and the blades are not fitting. The quality is extremely bad.In general I just bought this handle for general work , so I dont have any specific requirements. The only one I had was blades to fit on it , but it is not able to fulfill it.Don't waste your 4-5$. It is better to give a few more and get something usable."
1,Poor quality,"I have used this type of scalpel since medical school and they last very long time. Bought this one for the home use to do some biology study for tutoring. It started getting rusty in less than 4 weeks.On the handle it say ""Stainless Steel"". How could it be? This is cheap product and not worth the money. I am getting my refund."
3,It's a scalpel blade handle,"This #3 fits the #10 scalpel blades I bought. You only get one not two like you see in the picture. It is what it is, a blade hadle. Blades fit well. Ordered on a Sat arrived on a Wed. Good product."
1,Issues with Scalpel,When I ordered a box of # 11 surgical blades I also ordered the Scaple Handle #3. The first handle was unbelievable poor quality. You could not get the blade on the handle. I contacted the vendor and he sent me another handle. The second handle was also of poor quality but I was able to load the blade onto the handle with the aid of a pair of pliers...to avoid cutting my finger off.The groves on the handle that allow loading of the blades are unfinished and poorly manufactured.
5,Great Scalpel Tool,This tool is well crafted and very durable and simple. I like it alot for removing things that shouldn't and won't be attached.
3,"Only 1 scapel handel, #3 NOT #4","I'll believe the company that this was unintentional - the reality is that what you will be getting is a single #3 scapel handle. I wasn't impressed with the packaging because it could have EASILY been bent in transit, but it was not. Don't be mislead, you get 1 number 3 handle. It's a nice handle, no blades, so be sure to order them separately."
4,Works for what I wanted,"I purchased this to use with disposable blades for hunting, it definately serves its purpose, it was not delivered in the time in which it had said but it was affordable and good for what I needed it for."
5,My two year old LOVES it. What more can you want,"I got this as a reward system to give to my daughter after she picked up her toys. Its great to have a stamper that you can interchange the stamps instead of having many different stamps in a box. My daughter, 2, loves to pick the stamp and color too. It's very convienant and stores nicely."
2,Doesn't work with Dell Inspiron 3800,Installed in laptop and it says that there is an error in the memory so it reverts to the old 64m chip I reinstalled. Both memory chips did the same thing. Dell is difficult to find compatible memory.
3,Mixed Review,"Some of the writing is brilliant, and there are some clever plot themes. But, depending on your view or reaction, some of the scenes are painfully realistic (and some are over the top ridiculous), and the nudity and blunt, graphic language make me uncomfortable at times. I was a huge Sex and the City fan, but they played most of the sex and blunt language for laughs very effectively. This feels more real (and also depicts much younger women - early 20's), and actually much more like softcore porn at times. It is strangely addicting, though, so perhaps that's my final word. I must say that the Hannah character's nudity may have positive affects for women and their self images though. She does not have a typical Hollywood hard body, is a bit plump, etc. It's about time that more mainstream women's bodies are portrayed on film and tv. I do not think the show is appropriate for teenagers. I'd say it's definitely for the college-age crowd and over."
5,Fantastic Show!,"This is a great show and for the greatly reduced price of the ""normal"" vs. HD version, I think the quality is really good, too."
2,Not Witty at all....,Lena Dunham is not attractive nor funny. Idk how she got into the entertainment business because shes just not talented in my personal opinion. i have no problem with nudity but this chick needs to cover up..the sex scenes were incredibly unrealistic and awkward and not in a good way. I feel no love for any of the characters. If you like good writing this is not for you.
4,"Hey, Maybe Prurience Could Be A TV Show","Prolly hasn't been done before, right? An one a them cable stationswill air it sure. An you don't even have to dig deep or anything,cause characters being simple and needy and rude are likefully...entertainment. That zite guyst thing or something. Right?Then, 16 months later, with the show just an embarrassment, the creatorcan look up the word ""prurience."""
5,Brilliant,Encapsulates the language and actions of Gen Y women beautifully. A far superior exploration into female relationships than Sex and the City could ever have achieved.
4,Better than expected,"This quirky, off beat comedy delivers. Adam the boyfriend has become one of the most interesting characters, I like his often weird, but honest and real. It's not sex in the city in any way. I did take me a couple of episodes to really buy in to the series but I do enjoy it."
5,Horrifyingly real,"I'm puzzled by all the people who complain about this show. ""Not enough diversity."" ""Selfish, whiny, entitled characters."" Duh - so? The same people would fault 1984 for not showing a more balanced view of totalitarianism. The show is not supposed to be edifying or heroic. It is hysterical because it shows us glimpses of foibles up close that we've never consciously considered but that we recognize instantly. There is no glorification here of anybody. To seek role models out of this show is to completely miss the point. If you enjoy it for what it is - and are under 40, I suppose - you'll love this show."
2,Ehhh....,"I bought this as a result of all the hype surrounding this show, and was completely disappointed. I forced myself to finish it out, thinking surely it would get better/more interesting as the episodes went on, but no such luck. I am a huge fan of Lena Dunham & loved her film Tiny Furniture, so I thought this would be in the same vein. As much I love Lena, I've got no love for this show."
3,expectations too high,I've heard so much about this show and it's won so many awards that I was hoping this would be a great show. The pilot was okay at best. I will try another few episodes in case it takes a while for it to hit its stride.
3,Girls Maybe,I am not sure how to rate this series. As a guy it may be a little to girly in choice and may suit women more than men. I think it depends on your taste in the genre to make you own decision. I know it was nominated for a Golden Globe hence my decision to have a look. I think it boils down to a personal choice in the end.
3,fun but trying too hard sometimes,I think Lena Dunham is really talented but it does not show in all the episodes. I noticed the episodes that were written by Dunham were much better than the episodes written with other people. Series also tries a bit too hard to shock with 4 letter words and sex that I really don't care about. Acting is really good.
2,I Don't Know How I feel.,"Okay so I started watching this all the way to the end of season 1. At first I could totally relate to Hannah and then somewhere in the midst of empowering women I lost my feelings for the show. While the concept of this show is good I felt there was a lack of well DIVERSITY! They're all young, WHITE, fresh out of college and have they're parents money available when they need it. Sure it's realistic... for like 2% of the population. I would have liked it better if there was a variety, like wealthy, middle-class and poor racially and morally diverse women. Also I'm perfectly fine with sexuality but the butt sex was just freaking bizzare!!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"After hearing that the show was funny and well written, I decided to watch the pilot. I have been very disappointed, the show is neither funny or well written. The characters are very dull. Will not watch another episode."
1,yawn fest,"This series is incredibly lame and boring! Not worth the money, especially since there are only 10 episodes! I do not recommend this series, and it's not often I say that!"
3,Tries to hard,The show isn't bad but often times I find it just uncomfortable to watch because it seems they try too hard to make it funny.
4,Very good show.,"Lena Dunham's writing is awesome, but the show is sometimes marred with some sick or unpleasant scenes. I think this show is for25-year-old women and 50-year-old men."
3,IT was,this was a story as it was movie. Did not hold my interest but good quality. Took some time in the middle to upload.
2,Couldn't make it past the 2nd episode,"This series got a lot of publicity because of the Emmys, so I thought I'd give it a try. I really enjoyed the first scene, where the main character is trying to talk her parents into continuing to pay her expenses while she is an unpaid intern, but it went downhill after that. It wasn't because it's pretty crude; I watch plenty of HBO shows along the same lines, but I didn't find it to be funny. After two episodes, I was done, and I was mad at myself for purchasing the entire season when I should have only invested in it episode by episode. There's not a lot of shows that I download that I don't end up watching the entire season of, this was one of them."
5,.,"shipping was almost instantly. bought this as a gift for my girlfriend since she loves watching Girls on HBO, might have to get her season 2 when it comes out"
4,Smart & Funny,"Girls is one of my favorite new shows. It is such a relatable show for anyone experiencing the post college gap. While you could compare it to SATC, and the show often references it, I think the writing is way smarter and the characters are less over the top."
4,"Great Show, Not Sure if its Up to the Hype","I really enjoyed this show - I watched the whole first season in a day. The writing is real and honest, and I appreciate the different body types of the main characters - they look more like people I'd actually be friends with. I laughed out loud several times per show and cringed in awkward moments - mainly because I remember doing similar things myself at 24.I had heard so much about the show from awards, news, etc. that I don't think it would have been possible to live up to it. I really liked it, but I don't think it lives up to all the hype - its a great, well-written show that portrays young urban women in a more realistic way - but it still has its weird TV tropes and out-of-character moments. Overall though, a fun watch!"
5,Love this series,First season complete and it is one of my all time favorites. You will not be disappointed with this quality purchase.
4,It's good,It it a good show overall......but my one complaint is there is no one to root for...none of he characters is very likeable but the stories are fantastic.
4,It Met My Expectations,I like this show. Not the best but not the worst either. Pretty funny. I would recommend it to anyone!
2,I am just not interested I,Ok I read all the hype and while I am now considerably older than the demographics for this show I thought I would check out the last episode and well I am just not the target audience and really...get a job.
3,A good start but loses steam...,"An entertaining and humorous examination of fragmented, neurotic, and self-absorbed personalities in situations that had me chuckling and maybe a little annoyed at times. It's bold and not ""fakey-fake"" like Sex And The City was. Watch the first episode and go from there, I would not recommend purchasing the entire season unless you have already seen and loved it. Loses some steam after the first few episodes.Although I may have given this just an ""okay"" rating, I am impressed with Lena Dunham's work and look forward to seeing where she will go from here."
1,Worse than most shows...,"....if that is even possible. Watched 3 episodes and can't find any reason to watch this show. I could not relate to any of the cast on the show and every male member is a total loser/dirtbag (and not in an entertaining way). I have mentioned this before in one of my other reviews, with so many great shows on TV at the moment (Boss, House of lies, Homeland, The League, Dexter, and many others) don't bother with this badly written and boring show."
1,Soft Porn,Silly stories used to link one sexual act to the next. Characters with no qualities other than an excess of hormones; one dimensional.
3,Did not See,Did not see any of the show. Just saw the trailer. It has been winning awards and acclaim. Seems to have captured the moment.
1,"This is a clip, not the season","I am totally bummed, I thought this was the season but was only a clip. I got some popcorn, got all comfy on the couch. Psych. Boo Amazon. Boo. I completely missed where it says 'runtime 2min'. :("
5,"Finally, a reason to own a Tee Vee","My friend, Alandro, told me about this when I saw him at the food co-op recently. He mentioned how funny it was,but in a totally not comedic way that's commercial and corporate, like most American television. I had a hard timeseeing the first episode, since none of my friends from Yoga, or the cafe down the street have televisions, but whenI finally saw this show when I went to Ohio for Christmas, I lol'd. I live in Park Slope, so I found these charactersrelatable, especially the Dunham character. I decided I had to have the dvd plus I got a Tee Vee, with HBO in it.(after all these years they got me). They totally get Williamsburg, thanks Girls."
4,Very Original,"Very original, clever, well-written, well-acted but also sad. I wonder if some young people really live and think the way these girls and guys do. Not sure that I will watch any more episodes."
2,I did not like this series,"Call it my age and my experience , althought this series has gotten a lot of possitve attention I did not like it at all.The depiction of modern educated women as so paralyzed in their lives is a trend that I would like to see reversed.I know many young women who are sure footed and secure about their identity, sexuality and future. What is depictedhere is anti feminist and silly not funny. At times some of the action is alarming making me think that young women arebeing objectified in ways that are dangerous because they are going to injure their sense of self and they seem to beaware and unaware of what is happening to them. Men are still in control although also depicted as dumb."
2,These are for girls and women not men,It was moderately entertaining but really didn't find the girls or their situations realistic or very interesting. I wouldn't sign up for HBO so I could see this.
5,Best show ever.,Girls is a refreshing and realistic take on post college life for modern day 20 somethings. The writings is witty and intelligent. I strongly recommend anyone to watch this series!!!
4,Enjoyable story,"The Guardian is an amazing story combining historical romance with folklore.While traveling west with her minister husband and other missionaries, Charity Bennett finds herself alone and unsure about her husband's decision to go west where so much is uncertain.Black Sun, an Arapaho doctor on a spirit quest, finds her alone and injured and cares for her, though he cannot wait until he can leave her with other white people.I was further pulled into the story by the folklore that Black Sun shared with Charity, I felt it was very meaningful to the story and helped make the story more than just historical romance. Elizabeth Lane's imagery of both the prairie lands and the difficulties faced by Charity and Black Sun wrapped into my imagination filling every sense. The Guardian is an enjoyable story for a rainy afternoon."
1,Never buy anything from Aspyr!,"If you ever get this game running, you will see the numerous bugs (like the glowing buildings), the horrible speed on machines that well exceed the ""system requirements"", and countless options taken out from the PC version. The biggest bug though is that it will crash on many machines. Aspyr has a patch to download on their website for this, but it requires the serial number from the CD case, which is a problem because they shipped thousands of copies with invalid serial numbers. They have no tech support to speak of, which is fitting I guess for their horrible products.In short, Aspyr is a crooked organization that may be in line for some class action lawsuits, and I wouldn't have paid one cent for their typically worthless mac port of Simcity 4 if I had known anything about Aspyr beforehand."
4,Beautiful Game,"Having a great time on my iBook, no major performance issues. Some slowdown on highest graphic settings. I reccomend buying expansion pack along with the game from the beginning."
3,Another SIM,"I come and go through the sim cravings... However, it is not a game that I would say I play every single day forever & ever. It is very similar to the other SIM City games & offers some other neat functions. Overall, it is great while I'm interested & playing, but I do go through times where I get bored with it."
1,A unplayable WASTE of money!,"This is my first Sim City for Mac, I've played the other's on PC and enjoyed them very much - it's my favorite game. Naturally, I shelled out about $50 for this piece of junk! I have a brand new (2 week old) iBook G4 and this game is simply unplayable do to the scrolling problems. You end up placing or destroying things in the wrong place - it's very frustrating!The graphis are great - but who cares? What good are graphics when the game is unplayable?Read the reviews on here and don't waste your money."
2,Should be Crash City not Sim City,I bought this game for my son and I am now spending many minutes a day rebooting his MAC computer. The game locks up the entire system and requires a hard reboot each time. If this was an automobile from GM of Ford the roads would be littered with wrecked cars. Don't waste you money.
2,serial key error,"As of this moment I am very dissapointed with this game- and I haven't even got it to work yet.It appears that some copies of the game were shipped out with invalid CD keys, and I just so happened to pick one up.Potential Buyer Beware! You might get a copy with an invalid CD key!"
1,Be warned,"This game will not work unless you have the requisite souped-up video cards to support it.For example, a plain G3 iBook will not run the software-- at all. You get a bizarre error message and then it quits."
2,Not that great,"It's huge to install (2 disks), slow on average macs and quite boring, after all.Lots of wonderfully graphics and ideas... but I have little fun playing with it - getting the financials balanced is pretty complex, this games should be fascinating for accountants but maybe not for strategy gamers.All in all I miss Sim City 1, the good ole one..."
1,Waste of money,"Do not buy this book, It is a waste of money. Firstly, It does not have CD to practice the ""Listening Test"", Secondly, this book is for teachers practice only."
5,Do your Homework before you buy,"One must do his or her homework before buying or installing additional memory into a computer.1) Consult your PC/motherboard manual and make sure that what you are buying is in fact right type of memory for your PC.Things to watch for are memory type, bus clock speed, and max size of memory supported by the slot. Don't buy a 512Mb memory for slot that supports only 256.2) Before you install memory into computer ground yourself! Don't go rubbing your feet on that polyester rug of yours so that there's a little ark emitted everytime you touch something.Should you follow these 2 rules there will be no problems with upgrading memory, otherwise, blame no one but yourself."
1,Did not work for me,Do your homework before buying. Make sure it will work with your computer. I received a reply two weeks later from SimpleTech after contacting them twice that it would not work and to return for a refund. It is not that simple.
5,Simply the best,"Every simpletech product i've used has been exaclty what their name stands for, SIMPLE. Just turn the computer off, open it, put the memory in and close it up. Some say memory is memory. I know I can rely on the Simple tech product.Much love to Simple tech."
4,"It's so simple, it's simpletech","I bought two to equal 512MB and saved money. It's so easy to install, just turn the computer off, open it, put the memory in and close it up. Now I have more memory and it was so simple to install, that's why they are called simpletech."
4,This is a good gift,"I got Bratz Stylin Rides Motorcycle with Cade for Christmas and when i unwrapped it i loved it! I wanted this more than anything and i was really happy, and then i opened it up and noticed a few problems- One being the lights didn't work! I tried everything to get them to work but they just wouldn't. Another thing i noticed is that the handle bars are really delicate and could break easily. The doll is really cool and durable though. Overall, this is a good toy but a bit disapointing."
5,The Coolest Bratz thing yet,"I got the motorcycle and it is perefect. PLus the boy goes perfect with the bratz crew. I also have the runway, limo, fm cruiser and all the bratz dolls made ever since they have came out. Even the rare doll Megan. This is the coolest thing if I could go any higher I would rate it 1,00000 stars."
3,reconsider,"When I bought this toy I thought that it was going to be very fun to play w/, but it tured out that the ""cade"" doll did not want to fit on the motorcycle.That was very sad.So if you're thinking of buying it,mabey you should recnsider and buy the motorcycle w/cloe."
5,"Totally like, motercycletastic!!!!!!!","Ohmagosh! This boy is ssoooooooooo delicious! Oh so sexy!!!Get him and you WILL behappy!I got him last Christmas!!!!Isn't he awesome?!What a guy!Sometimes my friends come over and wanna make out with him, but NO! He's my boyfriend!"
1,(Sorry to be forced to give a star at all),"There was a time when I might have been inclined to agree with some of Roiphe's sentiments -- I thought I was strong enough to make a ""NO"" clear, therefore, all women were. I now realize how faulty this logic was. I am better educated now about the pressures women are under in all aspects of life. I have a real problem with the conservative tendency to ""blame the victim"" whether in terms of rape, disease, poverty etc. Books such as this one propagate a view which cheapens compassion and operates to undermine solidarity between human beings. I think that Katie Roiphe will one day wake up from the hang-over -- a result of all that wining and dining by the ultra-conservative right-wing press and realize she herself has been violated. One should have the strength to say ""NO"" to judging and condemning others for a few dollars more. No informed person can truly believe, let alone write, the tripe in this book."
1,Angering and disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in the content of this book. Not only were her arguments vague and incomplete, she neglected to consider many important and valid facts. She turned statistics around in order for them to agree with her arguments. I am ashamed to say I own this book. It was a waste of time to read, and offensive in more ways than one. The author needs to take a good look around at the world and swallow a bit of reality. Life isn't all one Ivy League school."
1,"""Date Rape"" - fiction or reality","Recently read this book, very sad, what about ""date rape"" drugs, women portrayed as perpetrator/predator v. victim, maybe on the campus of an elitist school in the 1980's and 1990's, but not today, agree with previous comment that ""she writes about a subject she knows nothing about"""
1,roiphe's personal experiences,"roiphe claims she has not come across too many friends who have been date-raped. well, of course she hasn't. with her ""sensitive"" attitude why would anybody want to tell her they had been sexually assaulted? why risk being told that you are exaggerating your pain? or perhaps even being suggested that you deserved it."
4,The backlash to the backlash !,"Little is more telling of impact than the reaction it illicit from the group under criticism. Lately, and rightly, we have seen challenges to the feminist status quo ideology, attacked fiercely by suspects who have long relied on the good will of reasonable people and their own pseudo science to build and reinforce their dubious claims. Feminist ideology has had a free ride, without critique for decades. Eventually people were bound to notice. You can here the diatribe echo from the cob filled catacombs: sexism, racism, misogyny, backlash........ Roiphe is by no means perfect in her writings but unmistakably needed. So to those that hold their misguided faith closely, I say get used to it, it is called reasonable discourse and is the basis for progress."
4,"thought provoking, whether you agree or not","Whether you agree with her arguments or not, this book is a thought provoking look at what some of the issues regarding date rape really reflect. Is it insulting to women to think that we are unable to say NO when we mean NO? Roiphe presents what I feel is a valid point - rape happens, and is horrible, and in no way should a woman be made to feel responsible for a forcible rape, but women do have a responsibility to make their wishes known clearly. As a college student, I know too many girls who've had sex even if they didn't want to because they worried about what the boy would think if they said no. Is it rape if the woman doesn't clearly state that she doesn't want to have sex? This book presents a strong argument that women are strong enough to voice their own opinions, and it is just society's implied roles that lead women to think that their voice doesn't matter."
4,-On Campus 1993. Got Print?,"I bought the hardbound release way back in prehistoric 1993.My female friend has yet to return it to me, so I assume she likes itenough to keep it. Author addressed honest perspectives that can make a feminist quasi-community blink in denial instead of putting her analyses on the discussion table-- not bad for a recent college grad (at that time). Katie's occasional fluff wedged between her thoughtful insights are easy to make fun of, though! But some fluff is always good or else it becomes textbook reading."
2,No different than stock,"I changed out the front door speakers in my 2008 corvette after reading about the tremendous difference between these speakers and the cheap stock ones. I can honestly tell no difference at all. I know there should be one, and I wish I heard it, but I do not."
5,Boston Acoustics S35 Speakers:,"These speakers work out very well in the dash of my 1994 Cavalier. They sound crisp and lifelike without sounding harsh and at only $46, don't know anyone can beat that."
5,Warm and Wonderful,"Hart Rouge is a French-Canadian group with a trio of siblings at its core: Paul, Michelle, and Suzanne Campagne, augmented by Davy Gallant and Michel Dupre. With voice, percussion, and assorted guitars, they make music that draws you right in and holds you spellbound. If you listen to the first three or four cuts on Beaupre's Home, chances are you'll be hooked. Performing both original tunes and songs by writers as diverse as Nanci Griffith and Zachary Richard, the group makes every cut sound like its own. Like the music, the recorded sound is full, rich, and dynamic. This is a warm, wonderful CD, and I only hope it gets the attention it deserves."
5,Hart Rouge - Beaupre's Home,"I bought this cd after hearing one of its tracks (A La Claire Fontaine) on our local classic music station. It was so hauntingly beautiful, I was hooked straight away. I couldn't buy it locally (I live in Australia), but I was able to buy it on Amazon. I play it often, and enjoy it more each time. If you like folk music, or even rhythm and blues, this cd may appeal to you also. There are traditional style folk songs, as well as songs which tell stories of the times - some are quite blunt, and even sad, but for me, all are good. I would recommend this cd to anyone wanting music that is just that little bit different."
5,found after all these years,"I was 12 or so when I first heard this ""album"". It was my introduction to Ray Charles. I had never heard anyone Wail like he did, and the version of In a little Spanish Town and his incomparable ""I got a woman"", along with a number of other top flight covers and other original stuff just knocked me out. I lost the album so several years ago I looked for it online and to my chagrin it was out of distribution. I was delighted when Atlantic decided to re-release it as part of their 50th anniversary.My liking of the album has not dimmed at age 61."
3,not his best,"I was disappointed with this album. Ray is great, as usual, but the backup musicians on this recording sound stiff, wooden, and mechanical, which is surprising, because this is a live album. None of the songs covered here are as good as their original versions"
1,"bad move, i'm sending it back. READ THIS BEFORE BUYING.","I didn't read the previous reviews carefully enough. DVD's recorded on this unit can only be played back on this unit. I bought it so I could record DVD's and watch them elsewhere. Since I can't do that, I am sending the unit back. It is too bad that this feature--or lack of feature--wasn't mentioned in the item's description. That would have saved me considerable time and trouble."
4,Truly a great machine!,"The invention of a DVD recorder has been long in coming (in a price range that's affordable) Set up was a breeze. I had it up and recording in less time than it took me to get my VCR working. I have recorded from tv and from VHS tape and it seems that the recorded DVD is better! The DVD Ram disks are re-recordable, so you can use them over and over. The only drawback is you need a DVD Ram player to play the recorded DVD's. If sharing your DVD's was a priority, the Panasonic DMR-E20 records DVD-R and DVD Ram formats. Some newer DVD Players play the DVD-R format. In any case, the Panasonic DMR-E10 is a great machine and the price is unbeatable from Amazon.com."
5,this player recorder is awsome.,this player recorder works great the recording is awsome its so much better than vhs tapes i tape all kinds of shows and they look great i highly recomend this recorder the features this has are great i like that it has dolby digital and it has progressive scan the picture is awsome with this recorder.
3,Good Case Simulator in Psychiatry,"This is the Psychiatry section of the Underground Clinical Vignettes series. If you have trouble getting a general image of psychiatric disorders, or cannot associate important facts with clinical scenarios (keywords etc), this is the book you need. Because, as matter of fact, that is exactly what you need to do during the test. On the other hand, do not think you can get away by just working on this book. This book covers 54 major cases that you frequently see on the exam, but of course this is not enough. This can be a great ""supplement"", but not enough to use it as a ""major source"". I especially suggest this book as a good reinforcement if you are using ""Blueprint Psychiatry""."
5,I Love This Disc,"This is a great combination of new celtic inspired jigs with fun and inspiring new folk songs based on the history and legends of British Columbia. Hoorray for Tiller's Folly! Proving that Canada has another maritime province, with it's own rich history and musical heritage. But you don't have to be from B.C. to appreciate the pathos of Spanish Banks or the humour of Ned McGowan's War. They also do a very fine rendition of Auld Lang Syne in Burn's original melody."
4,"Review of Schroeder's ""Thermal Physics""","The mathematics was a little too heuristic, however Schroeder's presentation of the material and essential concepts is succinct and readable. Overall this work is worthwhile and extremely helpful."
2,Lack of rigor was hard to deal with,"I tend towards more rigorous books, so I found this one a bit hard to read. In a way it's good for self-study since there's so much discussion, but now after having taken a graduate course in Stat Mech, and looking back on some of the sections in this book, you see that the author was hiding the important details in order to simplify the math. For me, at least, this had the opposite effect, making harder to understand (which it should be for anyone who's observant and paying attention to detail)."
4,Good Book,"This is a well written textbook. I hadn't thought this when I first used it, but after reading other books on the subject, I realized that this is the best there is. Between reading the text and doing the chapter problems, you should be able to develop a good understanding of thermodynamics and statistical physics."
2,This book alone is not enough to learn thermal physics,"The author is a master in the art of talking allot without saying much. There are few worked examples and no answers in the back.With this book you will learn more about the author than thermal physics.The book has potential, I found a few parts helpful, however, I needed to use other sources to learn the material."
5,very helpful book,This book is very helpful with any level of statistical mechanics course.Every hard and profound topics has been stated here in a very simple manner.It turned out to be a good companion for solving statmech problems.
2,"easy to read, but not enough","As a student I do NOT like this book. The author's writing is clear and concise, but too concise. In trying to teach myself these concepts I felt there was little help from the book. There are absolutely no example problems to illustrate concepts or to build confidence before attempting the problems. Also, there are NO answers in the back of the book to check if the work you did do on the problems is even correct. I appreciate his ability to convey these concepts but I also think that it is nearly useless to someone trying to learn. I feel as if i understand all that he writes, but then applying it is near impossible because of the lack of in depth analysis of the topics."
1,Once upon a time there was Thermodynamics.,"This book is good if you are planning on teaching your kindergartener thermodynamics before bedtime. It even includes a brief discussion of Humpty Dumpty's inability to be put back together again. You can explain enthalpy or Gibbs free energy to your child as a magic spell, making this book a great addition to the Harry Potter series!If you enjoy the incorrect explanation of energy as a fluid, this book is for you!"
2,"Few worked examples, no answers in back","While a good theoretical understanding can be obtained from this book, the lack of many worked problems in the book and the absence of any solutions in the back presents a real problem for any self-study. You must have a knowledgeable professor who can work out a lot of examples in class. Unfortunately I do not have a good professor, so I've had to pick up other texts to solve my difficulties. I'd avoid this book unless it's absolutely required for a class, and even then I would suggest taking very good notes in class to supplement the book."
4,Great explanations; Enjoyable to read,"Schroeder sets the mark for readability with this undergraduate physics text. This was my favorite among all my undergraduate texts; by far the easiest to understand and most enjoyable to read. His explanations are clever and witty. I enjoyed his lucid introduction to combinatorics in statistical mechanics. Schroeder gets an A+ in defining abstract ideas such as enthalpy, partition functions, and intensive vs. extensive quantities. On the flip side, the organization is loose, and there aren't enough worked out examples in the latter chapters. I highly recommend this book to professors who want students to actually read and learn from the text."
3,Save your money,"Uh-uh, no. Underhill's photography is amazing but except for the cover and a dozen or so pictures these are boring pictures and the production quality of the book is lousy for it's cost. The picture quality is grainy and the paper and binding has a cheap feel to it. Save your money and buy your favorite Underhill poster instead of this book or buy Marcus Schenkenberg's New Rules instead."
4,These boys are beautiful,"Not everyone will buy an Underhill poster, but everyone interested in cute young boys should buy this book. Beautiful images of cute guys at play. It's hard (no pun) to choose which one I'd want to take home with me. Keep it up (pun) Steven Underhill."
2,"Suffers from the standard objectivist flaws, and then some","This book had the potential to be valuable, but it asserts a lot more than it argues. If you're not already convinced, this book will not convince you. In particular it suffers from Objectivism's:-inconsistent ""value theory"" of property-substitution of normative self-interest for positive self-interest-impression that their peculiar ethics are self-evident if only people just understood it well enough (hence the asserting more than arguing)-irrational fear of fractional-reserve banking as suchOk, so that last one is more of a Rothbardian quirk than an objectivist. Nevertheless I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone honestly curious about anarcho-capitalism."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I consider this book a must read for any free-market thinkers. The authors did a great job filling in a few gaps I had after reading Rothbard's For a New Liberty, particularly around how free market police protection could work."
3,Great laptop if you don't try to update the BIOS,It's a great laptop but I had problems updating the BIOS. The system crashed and HP was of no help at all! Did some searching and found out this was a common problem. These guys helped get the system back up and running. Highly recommended!!!http://www.aqstech.com/hp.html
1,"HP Laptops Poor Quality, Poor Support","My HP zt1170 had the backlight on the LCD go out. Its just over a year old and just off warranty. They wanted almost $800 for the repair, but we settled for $577. Since that fix the LCD has failed twice and the hard drive crashed and had to be replaced. Fix #1 lasted 2 weeks. Fix #2 lasted only 2 months and they tried to stick me for another $649 by claiming I physically damaged/cracked the LCD which voided the warranty. Their word against mine, but I watched the LT fail each time and told them either they're lying or it was damaged in transit. I've spent countless hours on hold writing letters trying to communicate with Indian tech support with limited english language skills. I finally got them to repair my LT, but I feel like with the poor reliability history that its days may be numbered. If it dies again then I'm cutting my losses and scrapping it. HP is poor quality and support that at best is contemptuous of the customer"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING IT!!!,"This computer is very flakey. It cannot play any games more than once and has many little bugs, like all Hp's.I have never had a realiable Hp plus any notebook that has a shared graphic card or ""vidieo ram"" will not play vidieo games. No Hp notebooks play vidieo games. I reccomend Toshiba notebooks more."
1,"Lousy, lousy, lousy","HP/Compaq make lousy products, and they have lousy tech support. If you want to buy this, go to their website and custom-build it; it will be approximately $400 cheaper on their site configured as is, and you can pick better stuff if you want. I have a ze5400 that I customized to use for school and it is the worst computer I have ever had to work on. XP is the worst operating system ever created and I would reccomend that anyone who already has a computer with a perfectly functional screen/motherboard/cpu/etc just replace certain components (like cd drives) instead of getting a new, lousy notebook--especially one with XP. ~Note: Amazon seems to be a rip-off on nearly all of their electronics. Make sure you check the manufacturer's website first before you buy."
4,Good fun,"If you like westerns, where the good guys are easy to look at and always win, this is for you. My whole family loves it."
1,Don't be Fooled! Re-Boxing of Existing Sets,"Don't I feel like an idiot! I thought this new set combining both seasons would be fancier, spiffier, and basically re-created with ""more love"" for the show.Instead, this set is simply the individual DVD cases of the previously released Season 1 and Season 2 sets placed into one box. It doesn't even take up less space on the shelf than the two individual seasons.A disappointment and complete waste of money.(By the way, the one star is for this product's packaging, NOT the TV show, which was excellent.)"
4,The Magnificent Seven TV show,"I love this show. I was sad to see it end. I just love my set which I bought from you. The quality is just wonderful. Delivery was very quick and it arrived in excellent shape.I will be ordering some more very soon now.Sincerely, Marilyn Jo Weaver"
5,great western,this is one of the best western i have seen in a while it is really great everybody need to see this one it is cool and fantastic enjoy it MADDOG
5,Only thing missing?? More Seasons!!!,"The only thing wrong with this series is that as per usual, the ignorant ""powers that be"" canceled it way too soon! As is typical,if a series is interesting, somewhat humorous, fun to watch withno excessive violence, gore or up front sex......it has no chance onour networks! These actor made the perfect cast, this show was one ofthe best feel good Westerns where the good guys won and did so withat what you could feel was honor. Of course it wasnt given a chance,isnt that the way it still is today? I've ended my days of watchingT.V. shows, especially on the networks because as soon as you investin them, they are gone. Thank you for packaging this series, and thankyou to the Western Channel for bringing it back to T.V. Now, if onlythey would cast these same seven men and bring back this Magnificent Seven!!! They would be great even now."
2,"Amusing, but very superficial","Although there are many very funny stories about married couples that hit the mark, the author lives in a one-dimensional world. If she had children she would be less concerned with all her decorating problems and material concerns. Rather annoying reading for those of us struggling with bills, kids, work, and a marriage that is losing commong ground. For a Christian book, this lacks any practical or spiritual guidance, only a few bible verses."
3,Not for all nurses,"I am a case manager in Workers' Compensation. Some drugs used in Ortho treatments are not there. Sorry, this book does not meet my needs."
5,drug guide,I was very pleased with the speedy arrival of the guide. The guide was in great condition. Thank you!
2,Doesn't look as nice as the photo ......,It's an okay clock. Just doesn't look as nice as the photo. Looks more plastic.
3,Good Effort,"Having spent 15 years in North Dakota, I was looking forward to some insights into the lives of Jewish migrants to a difficult world. This book describes some aspects of their experience, mainly fascinating domestic incidents well worth preserving. Unfortunately, the book lacks a scene-setting introduction or epilogue to place her story in Eastern European and Midwestern history. What happeened to Sopie and her family after these events? Who are the others mentioned in the acknowledgements? The Rachel Calof memoir, which closely parallels this one, is a model of its kind and can be highly recommended."
5,Great Content,"On older version of this book was a text book of mine in high school. I still remember the content and apply it to discussions in my life 20 years later. So, I bought a newer version to give to my soon to be polical science major cousin. It's a must read."
2,Disappointing,"Based on 11 editions and 4/5 stars I was expecting much more. The chapter on socialism was extremely weak without even an attempt at a formal definition. The capitalism chapter described statism/mixed economy, as it exists in the U.S., and called it capitalism. I cut my losses on this book after the first two sections. This is an eighth-grade level survey of political theories."
5,Sir Cumference is Great!,"This is a great book. It has lots of mathematical elements while also being fun for middle school students. I, as a math teacher, enjoyed reading this book to my students. The math terms that tie the book together are very creative in the way they are presented. If you are reading this book to a class of middle school students, it will take from ten to fifteen minutes to read completely if the class is attentive. The math described in the book can help students to remember those terms later."
5,Very useful book for non-Jehovah's Witnesses,"This book was true to it's introduction and stayed true to it's mission. I would recommend this book to people who would like to find out about Jehovah's Witnesses from a positive point of view without fear of being ""converted"".There is absolutely too much material that tell people what they want to believe and reconfirms their prejudices against Jehovah's Witnesses. Even ex-Witnesses discover there is money and fame in spreading misinformation about this religious organization.This book is written by a Jehovah's Witness in good standing and gives reasons why he believes the way he does and lets the reader decide for him/herself if his stance is reasonable or not."
1,"Excuses, Excuses","This could have been an interesting book, but the author only confirms the charge that JWs are indeed a brainwashed cult. His ""proof texts"" come from the JW approved version of the Bible, which was translated by men with no scholarly backgrounds. What he says about the ""book sellers"" not receiving pay is true; however he fails to tell the reader that this door-to-door business must be recorded and turned in to the Kingdom Hall in order that leadership may keep tabs on progress of the flock. If this book was written to offset the popular Thirty Years a Watchtower Slave, it failed miserably."
2,Not the best choice,"It's a shame that this mp3 has an incredible poor battery life, because the radio is nice and it has some cool features and design.The battery hardly lasts 3 hours, that's why I give it only 2 stars."
4,Buen producto,"Asi es, la verdad me ha salido buenisimo, la bateria dura lo que debe de durar, aprox unas 8 horas....Vino en buenas condiciones y es pequeño, cabe en la mano....Lo recomiendo para corredores de media maraton, acaso piensan gastar 1GB de música en todo el recorrido? lo dudo!"
2,I wanted to like this player . . .,"The Philips PSA232 is not the worst MP3 I've ever encountered, but it's certainly far from good. I purchased this model (on clearance, not surprisingly as it turns out) and returned it three weeks later. The main problems: 1) As everyone has mentioned, the battery life is terrible. Even rechargable batteries often lasted only 3 hours. 2) Using a miniSD card to increase the storage introduces its own problems. I often had to reformat the card after songs had been transferred because Windows Media Player crashed during a transfer. 3) The player can be very picky about ID3 tags. If they are too long, or have unsupported data tags, the songs will not play on the device (even though the files are clearly listed on the player). So save yourself the aggravation and shop for a better model."
2,The mp3 consumes so many battery,"Its consume 1 battery for 4hours of music, i think that is so much. The FM also has very bad quality."
2,Not the best device...,"I love the size of this player and it's easy to use features. However, the main problem I encountered was downloading purchased songs to it. It kept freezing up and scanning through all the songs without playing them. I bought several songs from Rhapsody that I wanted to put on my mp3. Even though Rhapsody songs are listed as being compatible with this device,...no such luck. My husband had to convert all my Rhapsody songs (which was a huge pain in the butt), burn them to a cd, and then move them to my mp3 player. Since then, it's only frozen once and we had to delete everything off and start again to fix it. :-/"
1,poor battery life and terrible customer service,"I purchased three of these MP3s--One for me and two for my two children. One of the battery covers did not fit correctly and within one month of purchasing it, it fell off the product and got lost. I called Philips to try to purchase a new battery cover. I was told they do not sell it separately and the best they could do would be to exchange the product ""out of warranty"" for $75!! That was almost what I paid for the product! Also, the battery life is TERRIBLE. Even with rechargeable batteries, we go through them like water. I would avoid this product like the plague!"
4,Philips MP3 review,I have used this MP3 and find it fairly easy to use although the cradle for the player is difficult to seat the player itself into without hitting the buttons on the side. Other then that inconvenience it works very well.
1,Stay Away From This MP3 Player,First the player wouldn't recognized the MiniSD card. Then Dealing with Philips for the warranty was Horrible. They sent me 2 different units and one was worse than the other. ended up settling for a refund. It's not worth the headache.
3,Guide to DR,"This book had a lot of good information. However, the book was published in 2002 and some of the information was out of date. For example, phone numbers had all changed and some places were no longer in business. But for a good overall guide it was fine."
3,Works but be careful,"I use it to keep the ice out of the watering pail for my chickens. It works good to keep the ice away, but if you let the water level drop down and the unit runs out of water, this heater will fry itself trying to heat the air. I had it happen twice to me already had to return it."
5,No problems encountered,"For heating our small birdbath, this item has performed as advertised. To date, in the first winter of use, it has handled temperatures as low as 2 degrees above zero without any problems."
5,Mexican Spice,This spice is wonderful. I put it in/on almost everything. I especially like it in my omelets and on pan fried potatoes.
5,A Low Cost Memory Module,"After reading many reviews for the Brother HL-4070 CDW printer and seeing many suggested a memory upgrade, I added this low cost half-gig card to my cart to take advantage of Amazon's free shipping--that is important to me. Installation was simple and quick. I'm ready to ship large, complicated print jobs now."
5,Works on old HP laptop,"We needed to upgrade the memory on HP laptop Pavilion N5445 so it would run new antivirus software under Windows XP. This 512 MB memory from Crucial gave us an additional 508MB RAM, which added to one of our old 128MB memory chips gave us enough RAM. (PNY's 512MB PC133 memory did NOT work. They claimed our computer was too old to work with their ""new technology."") So, we are happy that Crucial makes memory that does work as it is supposed to. PNY is cheaper but didn't work, and in the future we will buy Crucial memory which does work. I also got much better customer service from Crucial than from PNY."
3,BUT RECIEVED SAMSUNG STICK,Works well. But as I said stick is labled samsung. At the time it was only thirty some bucks. 6 months later ordered from k company for less.
3,A picture book about a little girl who befriends squirrels in a park,"A lavishly illustrated beginner reader book about a little girl who makes a bargain with squirrels in a park - she'll help them collect acorns all autumn if they stop yelling at her to leave their acorns alone. A beautiful color dust jacket, black and white illustrations inside."
4,A Great book with broad Perspects,"This introduction to accounting and its significant role in making sound business decisions trains readers in becoming wise users. The authors present accounting information in a broader business context-emphasizing what accounting information is, why it is important, and how it is used to make strategic economic decisions-but still include traditional debit/credit information as optional coverage. A great book for practicing office professionals, accounting clerks and paraprofessionals, and staff accountants."
4,depressing...,Depressing because I wish I could work for an owner like Trotter who puts thier success back into their business and not their pockets.
4,"Terrific content, a little lacking in presentation.","This book stresses the value of service, attention to detail and the customer experience. These are all very important and it is wonderful to see that someone still has an appreciation of them in this world that at times seems to have left even common courtesy behind. I am somewhat disappointed that the book was not produced to the exceptional standards that Charlie Trotter boasts in it's pages. It is somewhat redundant and contains many misspellings. Even when recommending Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, the authors name is spelled Stevens instead of Stevenson. The print quality, paper and layout are great. The editing, spell-checking and typesetting need much improvement to be five-star quality. Terrific content, a little lacking in presentation."
3,Purple burgundy color,"I kept looking at the photo as I thought it would be more of a chinese red when the design of the set was considered.It is not even close to a red color, think dark mauve. The exterior is gloss and the interior matte black. The style is very sharp looking and holds 12 ounces. If it were chinese red they would be perfect."
4,Very Good camera,"I have added 3 of these cameras, as well as 2 Swann Bulldog, and 2 Q-See night vision cameras and 1 Q-See dome camera. These cameras are very good for daylight viewing, with no real night/low-light capability. The picture is not quite as sharp as the Swann Bulldogs, but they are very good for the price. Stay away from the Q-See products. The Q-See cameras have very grainy, fuzzy, washed-out pictures. I'm using 2 Q-See capture cards, which work well. I recommend these for cameras for daylight conditions, but if you want to spend a little more, the Swann Bulldogs have night vision capability as well."
3,"Seems to work okay, but poor ergonomic design","I received this thermometerPolder Speed-Read Instant Read Thermometer with Presets, Silveras a gift to replace a very-long-lived but finally failing Taylor unit. The Polder seems to work fine in all its modes, but I question the usefulness of having the head slanted as it is. I use the unit for testing items on the grill - often inserting the probe horizontally. The tilt of the head forces one to read the display upside down. It would actually be far more useful if the display were inverted!The on/off button issue reported by others is not a problem - just remember that the button has to be held for a few seconds to turn off.I would suggest to anyone considering this unit to perhaps look at others first."
2,Short Lived,"I believe I've had this thing less than a year. I'm having trouble with the On/Off button. I would like to easily turn it on when I want to use it and turn it off to save the battery when I'm done, but this has quickly become near impossible."
2,Not worth it,"I have 2 of these and neither of them will turn on or off using the button. I actually have to remove the battery. It will read the temperature, but it will continue to beep and does not shut off."
2,Sloooooow,I thought this would be a great solution but pressing the buttons is hit or miss - and you have to really press them hard! Beyond that the actual temperature read is far from instant. It takes minutes to get a read and this is brand new. I think it will be going back. It's too bad because the concept is perfect; I loved that you could choose the meat type and how well done or rare you would prefer but it's just unreliable.
5,Romping musical mayhem,"Idiot Flesh's second recorded cd. And oh my god does it shake the walls. A lot darker than their previous cd, Nothing Show. Kicking off with 'Dead Like Us,' once you learn the lyrics you too will joyously sing along with the raucous crows in the background. many of the songs stretch out well beyond the 5 minute mark. Rather than being a tedious listen each such track takes you on a wildly magnificent, extravagent ride. The music is layered with so many instruments that only repeated listens will do the album its full justice. If for no other reason this album should be bought for track ten 'The Straw,' an epic masterpiece taking words from the T.S. Eliot poem ""The hollow Men"" for lyrics. Unique, brilliant, one-of-a-kind, there will never be another band like Idiot Flesh. For those wanting to complete their collection of Idiot Flesh recordings also purchase Funny Rubber Hand and Rawk Party for the songs Monkey and Let the Dog Sing."
1,What Bubbles?,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. The thing barely works, having to be ""giggled"" and shaken to get any bubbles to come out, and then they're few and far between, in only short bursts. Then more giggling and shaking and maybe more small bubbles if you're lucky. A great disappointment for me and, more importantly, for my granddaughter. A VERY POOR product!!"
1,Junior Infinite Bubbles,It does not work at all.When you press the liver the soap wets your hand and you can not make bubbles.The machine is poor design and does not work i bought 6 of them as a gift and all of them had the same problem .I recommend not to buy it . you will loose money and on top of that if you give it to someone as i did you will feel insulted.
3,all your bubbles are belong to us,"these guns, and we ordered 4 of them, consistently loose their ablility to blow bubbles. anytime the gun is not upright it will have a hard time blowing bubbles later. i think they are loosing the primed condition. notice that the handle is shorter than the bottle so they don't even provide a useful way to combat this problem since the gun wont stand upright on a flat level surface. the guns tend to leak a lot too."
1,Terrible toy!,This toy is terrible! It worked great the first time and now it never works. I think it may have been designed to work with only the bubble solution it came with. I've tried other solutions and nothing seems to work. I wish I'd never bought this toy.
5,The Best Book Ever,An amazing book what else can I say besides It is good and you should all use it. IT has FREE sites and it helps with studying and quizzes. Great Book no it isn't great it is AMAZING
1,careful...this didn't work in my new dell 8200...,tech depot is proving to be a pain in the arse to return things.
2,REGULAR OUTPUT,"THE WORDS AND SINGING ARE GREAT... THE MUSIC IS SO SO, REALLY. I AM A BIG FAN O PETER BUT THIS ONE IS NOT THAT GOOD FOR ME. for a better option of a calm hammill record get Fireships or Everyone you hold. A lot better!"
4,Excellent starting point for new Astronomers,"I didn't quite know what to expect, but I am very pleased. Each section has it's own ""quiz"", which I enjoyed. You will learn from this DVD!"
3,poorly researched,I borrowed this video from the library recently. I got to the part where they talked about Tycho Brahe & claimed his cause of death was his bladder exploding because he drank too much wine & wouldn't leave the room to relieve himself so as not to go against the custom of never leaving the room before the king. This sounded too weird to be true. After a quick online search I found sites saying mercury is the more likely cause of death. This has made me a little skeptical of how well the video was researched. I'm very disapointed that an educational video would state an urband legend as fact.The video is very informative but I had trouble getting past this and plan on asking some more experienced astronomers for other video suggestions.
2,for kids,"I thought I was getting a video to teach me about astronomy. Nope. I was getting something for kids. Sometimes they sounded like they were trying to be cool, to keep the little kids interested. Sometimes they sounded like they were teaching school. All in all it was pretty unwatchable. I got to the part where they said that Tycho Brahe died when his bladder exploded because he was waiting for the king to leave the room first, and then I had to shut it off. Apparently that story is nonsense, if another review on this site is to be believed. All in all, an annoying video."
2,Not a big help,"Bought this to help my son with Algebra. He was struggling and I thought if he could see the Algebra in action, he is a visual learner, then maybe he would get it. Didn't help."
1,"Poor Quality, Battery Worthless","Used 4 times then battery would not charge and warranty would not cover it. Replacement battery is $117. Don't be fooled by nice look, this is a rip-off! I have found Toshiba to be a good mid-line brand but this is the last item I will buy from them.Send me $50 and you can have it!"
3,Nice but unreliable,"I bought this DVD player to entertain my kids while traveling. I liked its size, features, look and battery life. We took it on a trip overseas and it worked fine lasting about 5 hours (more than enough) on a charged battery. It is sensitive to the bumps, but on the plane it is OK. Even in the car it was OK when my kid held it on his lap. After that trip we didn't use it for couple months and when we tried it again the battery was hopelessly dead. I couldn't charge it at all. I had an adapter for the car so we could still use it, but it developed another problem that the screen would go off by itself (something wrong with the lid sensor). So in less than 6 months I had to send it back for exchange and we didn't even use it that much."
1,Poor sound and resets at the slightest bump,"I tried three of the same model and they all reset the DVD at the slightest bump.Even on an airplane, if I touched the tray table the unit would reset.I would not recommned this unit. I went with the 7"" Sony for a little more money and it works great."
1,Junk for watching movies,"On a recent road trip in a minivan equipped with a drop down screen we used the Toshiba SD-P1200 Portable DVD Player to play the DVD and we watched it on both the DVD portable screen and the drop down screen. We never once watched a regular 2 hour movie beginning to end. During a movie this player would skip and freeze so many times it had to be shut off before it got thrown out the window. It was very frustrating - especially having to be in the car for 12+ hours for 2 days. We did have a GameCube that we hooked up to just the Portable DVD player and it worked great. The GameCube was played for a good 4-6 hours straight without any problems. However the movie watching is where the problem is with the Toshiba SD-P1200 Portable DVD Player. So if you want to buy this portable DVD player without the intention of actually watching a DVD, then be my guest."
1,Not very good quality,I bought this dvd player a year ago and can't remember a time it ever worked correctly. It skips and freezes a lot (and thats when its placed on a table or other stable surface). You can only imagine what it plays like in the car.
1,Utter Piece of C***,"Purchased unit at retailer for $500 based on Toshiba's previous quality reputation. Battery would not charge after 3 months of extremely light use & hinge broke, requiring a screw driver to be used to open it. I've bought lots of electronics equipment from a variety of manufacturers & this has to be the worst purchase I have ever made...PLEASE, DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Battery does not recharge,"After few cycles, the battery just does not recharge. Image quality just marginallly better than a laptop pc. A waste of money."
1,Do not Buy,"Purchased this unit new from Amazon to give as a birthday gift. The birthday was after the 30 day return policy (suggestion: only buy and deliver gifts within Amazon return policy or your stuck with it no matter) The picture quality is horrible, the battery WILL NOT hold a charge at all and the only way your going to hear the audio (especially in car or plane) is with headphone. Apparently this unit is defective - Amazons' answer is to call Toshiba. This is not worth the money - I'v seen better pictures on the very basic units!"
1,Bad DVD Player,"My Toshiba SD-P1200 Portable DVD Player scratched my DVDs so badly that I can no longer watch them. Also, it no longer works unless it is plugged in. It does not work just running on batteries."
3,DVD Area,"I bought a SD - P1200 in the USA, but i use it in Brazil. USA is area 1 and Brazil is area 4. Nobody told me that i couldn't use it in Brazil. How do i change it? is it possible?If you can helpme, please write to me.My e-mail is : cvturismo@etelefonica.com.brtks.Eduardo"
1,Can't Handle Anything,I bought this player 2 weeks ago and I loved it for the first week. Great picture! Last night it quit. The discs wouldn't load. I tried 5 different discs and it would start and then stop.For [$$] I wouldn't recomend wasting your money on it!
2,Has it's downfalls,"So far I have owned an RCA5400P, a Mintek 1710 and the Toshiba SD-P1200. The Mintek unfortunatly started skipping on me and I would lose the right audio channel after a while but the price tag and the accessories such as the car adapter made it a great unit. I purchased the Toshiba today and it is going right back to the store. First off the screen is horrible compared to the Mintek, it is pixilated and dark, almost as if the contrast were turned all the way up and there is no way to turn it down. Also the dvd door is very flimsy and has to be completely shut all the way for it to operate, slight movements reset the player due to a bad push pin design and you have to start the disk over again. You would think that Toshiba would be making advancements in things like shock resistance and screen quality with a $499.00 price tag and not red rubber but right now I wish I just had my quirky Mintek back. :("
4,"Picture is iffy, but it's a solid unit","I also owned the Mintek 1700 and in fact, I took it back and spent an extra [$$] to upgrade to this Toshiba unit. The reviewers who said that the picture is hard, pixellated and looks like it has too much contrast (which you can't turn down, but can on the Mintek) are right. Compared to the Mintek, the picture is not as good. But the retailers actually warned me of that when I took my Mintek back to the store that I purchased it in. It's not terrible, but definitely not as smooth or pretty and vivid as the Mintek. It all comes down to quality. Do you want to spend [$$]on a unit that has a nice picture but breaks often or spend the extra [$$] on a unit that is sturdy and durable with a slightly inferior picture? When you decide that then you can figure out which portable DVD player is best for you. I'd like to have the Mintek's crystal clear picture back, but it was a hassle to exchange it every 2-3 months."
2,"Works as a dvd player, but not as a portable","The player is very durable physically, which was a pro for me, but I discovered alot of downsides that outweigh the good. For starters, the picture was o.k. most of the time, but when viewing dark-lighted movies (ex. scene at night) you couldn't see anything at all-the screen is naturally dark and you can't change its brightness levels. Two, you can fastfoward, etc. but you have to be careful doing so-if you press the skip button instead of holding it, you just skip to the next scene. Worst of all, though, is that the battery dies permenently very quickly...after charging and watching it about 5-10 times, the battery refuses to be recharged, and now I can only use the player when its hooked up to the adapter-which defeats the purpose of it being a portable player(and I do not want to shell out over $100 for a new battery; I doubt most be people do). More for the last reason than anything else, I suggest against buying this product."
1,Keeping my fingers crossed,"As others have said unit worked great at first. We bought it to keep our son entertained on cross country flights. First trip no problem, next trip (6 months later) the battery won't charge. Just ordered a new battery from the factory (no one else carries them anymore) for $150 and praying we're not throwing good money after bad. I have seen the unit get stuck on the loading screen also but SO FAR it will reset when power is disconnected. I expected a lot better reliabilty from Toshiba."
1,Batttery dead,I have only had it and few months and have used it only a few times and the battery is dead. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since I have read that many other people have had the same problem.
4,BT,"This book is very interesting for whom works in the moisture mesurement field. The book scopes a lot of aspects of microwave aquametry like measurements both in the frequency domain and measurement in the time domain. There is interesting information about dielectric properties of wet materials. The book contains a very useful information about manufacturers of moisture meters and recent bibligraphy. In conclusion, I recomend reading the book."
4,Works well in my Sony,"I added this memory (2 sticks) to my Sony RX850 . Although the OS (XP Home) does not recognize the additional memory, my applications are definitely running faster. I used to have to walk away and could eat a cookie or brush my teeth by the time Miscrosoft Office opened up a file. Now it opens my Office products in a few seconds, same with IE7."
5,No surprises,The Kingston memory I purchases for my Sony Vaio arrived as expected. Installation was straightforward; the only part that took any effort was moving components in the Sony case to allow me to access the memory.
4,Made it right,purchase RAM from retailer and had a bad stick. Retailer made it right with a refund of purchase price with no hassles at all. I would definiately recommend these guys since they stand behind what they do!.
5,worked fine first time!,added another 512 megs to an older system and bought some time before the next upgrade!
2,Wedge Downspout Screens,"The wedges are keeping the debris out of the downspouts but, are not self clearing as advertised. My wedge was clogged with debris and the gutter overflowed."
1,Wedge Downspout plugs easily,"The Wedge screen grating plugs easily with small tree seeds, leaves and other small debris. Once the grate holes are plugged the Wedge stops working. The 1 1/2 inch round drain hole in the wedge limits the water flow into the 2 x 3 inch down spout because it is 70% smaller than a standard down spout. My the gutter overflowed on the first rain storm due to the design flaws."
2,Downspout Screen,"The Downspout screen is a good design, Material quality is marginal and the weight of the item is much to light, allowing wind or heavy rain water to dislodge item from the duct. Added lead weights to keep in place. Adding a finer screen may keep leaves from getting stuck in unit."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"Does not fit our gutters, being way too small and the downward pipe hits the crossbar in the fittings. Sorry we bought these..."
2,"""Amazon Verified Purchase,",These items do not let the dirt (Leaves or small tree branched)go over the side. What happens is they stick to the screen and if there is enought of them will clog the downspout.
1,Downspout screen,"Yeah it covers the downspout hole in the gutter, but still dams up the gutter. It doesn't work."
4,Downspout Screens,"These are very nice at first , but I have taken them out and do not use the screens now."
4,This book was pretty good!,"This book was of a very fine quality. It is not every day that you hear about alien encounters. After selecting this book, I was amazed at some of tha stories. Science Fiction lovers will really enjoy it, as I did. The book's writing made you feel as though you are actually there."
2,there should've been more ponies...,"very nice review by the young woman before, but Eighteen pages worth of aliens eating Oakwood was enough for me to run into the Avenue. this is the Third spencer book i have read, and each one knocked me on the Floor. hi jil."
3,Very tabloid like but I did enjoy it,"As many of the other reviewers said, this movie did show like a tabloid. A lot about the scandals that plagued him but I felt there wasn't a broad enough representation of the people who knew Michael. The only members of his family that spoke were his mother, Tito, and his sister Rebbie, whom I'd never heard of until now. I was really expecting more people from his life to give their perspectives.I did enjoy watching it though, for the photos and (limited)video footage. There wasn't hardly enough of those things, though. A lot of still shots from the Jackson 5 days but not enough video. I enjoy watching Michael perform and especially his performances as child but there was very little video, considering this is a documentary."
3,Reflections of Michael,"This DVD I would indeed recommend to a true MJ fan, especially those who appreciate hearing about his humble beginnings. To me, that's the best part of the DVD ( the interviews from people who guided his career and witnessed his legendary status flourish). I have viewed several documentaries on Michael's life/career, and I would rank this one in the top 3."
3,Very average,"I wish there had been more ""never before seen"" footage. The film did cover the more historic area such as the formation and the beginning of The Jackson Five. I just wish there had been more information and coverage regarding MJ's ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"" eras."
1,Another tabloid like movie! Don't waste your money on this.,"Didn't enjoy this film. one half of it is so tabloidy. Rebbie Jackson implying he went too far with plastic surgery. Frank Cascio saying Michael gave himself a Demerol shot just before MSG. Paul Anka stating that MJ illegally stole and copied the TII demo tape and way too much time focused on the 2005 allegations and trial. Some of your highlights folks! So to all the MJ lovers out there.. don't waste your money on this. Supposedly David G is a friend, a friend would not come up with all this BS!"
1,Dont bother. This is a mess!,"I saw this and was completely disgusted. Gest is just another ""friend"" that betrayed Michael Jackson on every level he could. I am amazed, but not surprised that some of Michael's family joined in this fiasco and disappointed that Tom Messereau did too. This is just another tabloid junk movie, pretending to be a real documentary. Use your money to buy something worthwhile like Invincible or Blood on the Dancefloor."
5,Must Have For Your MJ Collection,"Not sure what all the nay saying is about. This is a wonderful full life look at clearly one of, if not the best performers of the 20th century. There was more insightful information about the man behind the glitz, cameras and media than I've ever seen before. If you want to know truly what Michael Jackson was all about in his personal life then you must see this in depth look at him through the eyes of those who were closest to him."
4,Outstanding Documentary,I do not understand the bad reviews for this excellent documentary. It was given to me as a gift but I would have purchased it. It is the best documentary I have seen about MJ. I particularly liked the first part which talked about the Jackson 5's beginnings at Motown. This DVD made Michael human to me. The only criticism I would have is that it was a tad too long.
1,ok,Kept waiting to learn something about MJ I didn't know. Believe me this video is boring it should be called The Jacksons because they glorified the brothers more than Michael.
3,A little disappointing,"The descriptions of each play are rather superficial- appropriate mainly for younger readers. The illustrations are amusing and pleasant, but there are very few lavish ones such as those found in other books by James Christensen. The cover art is deceiving in this respect. Those that are included are breathtaking. I do feel it is worth the modest price."
5,The fantastic artwork of imagination,James intoduce you in the world of imagination and fantasy. The best artist in the fantasy universe. This book is the perfect conbination of an artist and writer.
5,Do CD's ever wear out?,"This one may. ""Seattle"" is an incredible piece for getting out on the highway, just makes you feel pumped. ""This Old World"" still gets to me. I listened to about twelve seconds of this CD in the store and was hooked."
2,"EEEHHHH, OK","I gave it to my twin sister, who is pregnant with her first child and is doing the nursery w/ a Care Bear theme. I saw the music box online and was thrilled as it pictured Cheer and Friendship Bears, which were our 1st two Care Bears ever. What a touching present to give, right? But unfortunately, when I received it, Friendship Bear was replaced with Sunshine Bear. And it's kind of ""cheap"" looking. I still gave it to her and she thinks its cute. But it's definitely NOT what is advertised."
1,Care Bear Water Globe,I was very disappointed when I received it. The detail is terrible and the water is cloudy. The music box in it also sounds like it has been played alot already and very tinny. Also the box that it came in was already ripped and re-taped before I ever opened it. Not a great product.
3,"Dry, intelligent and aloof",Better read it in the morning so your not tempted to fall asleep. Couldn't make it all the way through.
3,CD Review,I was hoping it would be comparable to Afternoon Tapestry (which is scripture to song -love it!).
3,No plastic case!!,I should have read the notes! I love SanDisk cards but am really bummed that there is NO small plastic case with it. Since I usually throw them in a pocket in my camera case this is a problem.
1,Problem,"Can't have too many of these for my older Nikon dslr, but it is ""locked"" and there is no slide as on ALL my others to unlock so it can be formatted and written to. Is it me, or did I get a bad one? Not enough money to return so I will buy another."
4,sd card,"Its an SD Card what can I say, GREAT price and so far no issues had it and used it 3 weeks now."
5,Works as described,"I had no issues with the product. It holds 2GB of photos and haven't had any issues with corruption, etc. with it yet."
1,Why order this separately?,"I'm not sure why anyone would pay $25 for this BD, when this film is included on DVD with purchase of the 25th anniversary of the CD. So you get both the music disc and the film for $15. Don't get the logic here."
5,The best,"This video is amazing. I have new admiration for Paul Simon. Not just for his great musicianship, but also for his courage in standing against Apartheid."
3,Classic urban vampire camp,"I saw these films back when I was a teenager. The shock value is still there. The deep-bass voiced and renown stage actor, William Marshall (The Cartoon King on Pee-Wee's Playhouse) is regal as the African nobleman-turned-vampire. These films have a place in vampire film history. They are on the opposite end of the Universal classics. Both have value and should be watched."
4,GREAT fun with bells and whistles,"YES , my man William Marshall in VERY dignified!!! That does not prevent these movies from being both fun and funny though . It helps immensely . Yeah , i DO wish this double header was rated R . I'm just awfully pleased to have them both in one package . Both films are 1.85:1 aspect ratioed . Both films have English SUBTITLES and CLOSED CAPTIONS . Each film has it's own disc . BLACULA is a 1972 film that runs 93 minutes . SCREAM , BLACULA , SCREAM , is a 1973 film that runs 96 minutes . Both are rated PG . Are they scary ? not really . Who cares . Lots of fun to be had here people . In or out ?"
1,Buy a Service Agreement!!!!!,"I bought this dvd player brand new from the store in May 2005. By December it stopped working. Luckily I had a 2 yr service agreement, so I got a new one for free. That one broke 5 months later. I didn't use the product very often, but when used it had great picture and sound. Regardless, after 2 broken players in one year, I decided to switch to a different brand. My advice--buy a different brand or buy a service agreement!!"
2,could not play,my playstation2 could not play any games with a black or blue bottom. So I was not able to play the game.But the delivery was pretty fast.
1,WORST ''TOSHIDEN'' TO DATE,"AS IF THE FIRST SEQUEL WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, THE MAKERS OF THE 2ND TOSHIDEN RETURN WITH THIS ULTIMATELY DISSAPOINTING SEQUEL. SURE, THEY MAY BE MORE CHARACTERS AND MORE ARENAS AND MORE BOSSES, BUT CMON, THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY HARD TO GET INTO! WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ALL OF THE TOSHIDEN FANS SHOULD STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THE SEQUELS. WHAT A DISGRACE!"
3,"Good mystery, but lacks warmth","This is another good mystery in the Mandy Dyer series; interesting plot, believable characters, good development. The problem I have, though, is that Mandy is all business. There is no ""coziness"" here for those who like that type of mystery. Mandy doesn't have a social life or any fun. Her on again off again relationship with the detective is going nowhere fast. To make this series excellent, there needs to be a balance between Mandy's business/amateur detective life and her social world."
3,Missing something,"This really was missing something this time. I can't quite put it on my finger it with this one though. It almost feels like the book was rushed to be put together?It did take me a while to get through this and a few of the characters kinda lost me here and there, but since it's a Mandy mystery I couldn't not read it all the way through!"
5,I'm hooked,"WASH, FOLD AND DIE is another terrific book in the Mandy Dyer drycleaning mystery series. The funny first person voice is a delight to read, and the details of Mandy's drycleaning business add charm to the story. The characters--including Mandy and other recurring characters such as Mack, Betty, Stan, and Nate, as well as characters new to this book--are all freshly drawn. like I can't wait for the next book in the series."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I was really disappointed with this book. I don't mind unique styles of writing, and typically enjoy reading books that break the rules and aren't necessarily grammatically correct, it can give stories great support. I do give props to the author, the book def has a very unique style, it was exactly as it was described, like the book was written by a teenage boy, and I couldn't stand it. I had a really hard time and finally had to give up trying to get through it. :("
3,Found this somewhat entertaining,"I'm a sucker for coming of age stories, and I enjoyed this one enough to finish it. It's hardly Perks Of Being A Wallflower or Catcher In The Rye, but it did take me back to those awkward days of high school. The writing is simple, but effective, and upon finishing it, I did feel satisfied, even if I wouldnt rush to recommend it to anyone. Though I believe the book was written in the early 2000's so it already feels dated for a high school story. But I'm sure a 30-40 something could pick it up and it would feel familiar."
2,Not worth your time,This book just simply isn't very good. The only person whom I would give this book to is a high school boy who hates to read and just wants to read something stupid that doesn't really have a point. This book has no depth and won't make you think about anything. Lots of better stuff out there.
5,"an entirely surprising, sweet, hilarious, right-on novel","there are few (dare i say) affected writing styles that i find myself able to digest (pynchon's mason & dixon proved too impossible for me), but this book makes the grade. put aside the improbable illiteracy of jeremy, the hilariously deadpan and naive 10th grade hero, and you will find yourself laughing out loud at more than one passage in this small prize of a novel."
2,Hard to get through and dull,"I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top. It makes for such a difficult read. The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here."
1,nothing special,"This was at a friend's house and I gave it a read, and don't really think it was worth it. It's not bad, it's just there's not really much of anything there. Thin characters, thin plot, really just milking a long laugh about bad grammar. I take it all the good reviews must come from young people. That's fine, but just know it's a teen book, not an adult book."
2,ugh...'10th Grade' was as bad as 10th grade *no pun intended,"well...this is my first review, but i'm sorry that my first had to be about a bad book. there's really no plot in this story. it's just like a flashback of 10th grade. it's ""funny moments"" weren't really amusing to me. however, i know this book will get teens' attentions because it's the kind of books they wanna read, i think. anyways...this book really did nothing to me. don't waste your time."
3,The Truth,"If you're looking for insight into the life and mind of a high school boy, put this book down. Although certain aspects of the novel are somewhat similar to those of tenth grade guy's life, most of the book is completely absurd. The thoughts of the story's narrator are both bizarre and ridiculous. Maybe if this book were written by an unmedicated third grade psychopath, it might be more accurate. Furthermore, Weisberg's attempt to imitate the grammar and writing style of a tenth grader are both annoying and wholly inaccurate. However, with all that said, the book is somewhat comedic and it's suspense keeps the pages turning.P.S. I am a tenth grader"
3,ok,it was an okay story line. the incorrect grammar bothered me at the beginning but i got use to it as i kept reading. but i wished the ending was better...
4,typical sophomore,Jeremy was a charater that describe 10th graders exactaly how they are. This book showed him going through different stages and him maturing. But this is how it it. He talks about girl's bodies and is infactuated with boobs. He also handles the struggle though his soccer seasons.Jeremy is a good kid and many of the girls thinks he is sweet and kind. But his mind isn't always in the best place. Buthe sees how girls have their different feelings though out the book and seems to mature a little more. This was an easy read book and i recomend it to anyone that likes a stories that dont take alot to think.
2,Eh...,"This book was a bit typical for my liking. The setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters, all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school. Through this story Jeremy, our lead man, experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter. And what are these things? Why smoking, drinking, partying and sex of course! All told through immature eyes, making this book one which I did not enjoy very much..."
2,An Average Protagonist Makes for an Average Book,"I really wanted to like this book, but I was very bored with Jeremy. He's just not a very interesting or likeable character, and I felt that many of his reactions were too immature for his age. I felt that the plot of this novel got lost somewhere along the way, and the pieces never seemed to fit together. Ultimately, I did not care about Jeremy, and I found myself skimming through the last 1/4 of the book. Was this book for teenagers or adults? As an adult, Jeremy's troubles seemed petty and dull. I think most teenagers would not find Jeremy realistic."
3,Who is Jeremy?,"I laughed out loud many times while reading this book, and found some of Jeremy's insights extremely interesting and often genuine. But my main qualm with this story is that I don't really KNOW Jeremy. I realize that it's his chronical of what's happening to and around him, but I couldn't get a clear picture of what he looked like, how others perceived him, etc. There is, at times, a disconnect between his one-word replies to people (i.e., ""Wow"", ""OK"", ""Yeah"") and his random observations on life (""Divorce is ruining this country""). He comments at one time that he doesn't mind speaking in front of people, but I don't get the sense that he's at all out-going. In all, I'm glad I read the book for its descriptive tone, and will most likely check out Joseph Weisberg's next effort. (Bonus: Cool early-80's nostalgia!)"
1,Insanely unreadable.,"Wow. Only made it through Chapter 6 before I just couldn't take it anymore. Yes, Weisberg captures the voice of a 10th grader, but still could have used some commas and it would have come out the same voice!! That just made it too hard to want to continue reading. Ugh."
3,"Not a bad book, but not a good one either.","This is a pretty typical first novel, obviously autobiographical, and rather sweet, but lacking any real tension or plot development. I did like the interactions between the characters, particularly between Jeromy and Gillian.I do wonder if the novel would have made it out of the slush pile if the author's mother wasn't one of the most connected and powerful women in the country."
3,Great Book about High School Today,"This novel was an easy read for me. Weisberg made the main character Jeremy, a character that any high school student could relate to. I personaly couldn't relate to what he was going through at the time but I could certainly relate to the high school atmoshphere. The book was set in modern day so I could relate to the clicks around the school and being a sophomore. It was more of a book for guys but I did enjoy it."
5,Wonderful,Clear and concise! An adventure in reading and very historically accurate! This is a must read for history buffs (especially Elizabethan!)
3,judge's black robe,"I have ordered one at size 6. I am not sure if I am going to be able to wear a thick sweater under this coat. It is a bit tight fit. You may want to consider one size bigger. Also, when I opened the box, my first impression was that it was not heavy at all for a long coat. Frankly, I prefer heavier coats. The fabric looks fine. My main problem with the coat is that it does not have any interest, seam line etc. It looks like a judge's black robe on me. It looks better when not buttoned up. But, I bought the coat for cold weather. I could not decide whether to return it yet. I think for about $50 it is a good deal. The quality is fine. That's why I give 3 stars. I am not sure about the appearance though. The cut does not look good. It is not my taste at least."
5,Love this book,Love this book and all of the Patricia Veryan series. I read them when they first came out and now am trying to buy them all so I can reread over and over.
2,Don't Work For Me,"The padding is good for foot protection, but they slide down inside the shoe at the heels. Not for me."
1,Busted Dam,"No good, don't waste your money. Not worth messing with and takes up extra drive space ofr nothing! Not worth price!"
1,Dissapointment Galore,"Received unit, It broke after first use. Chauvet took 3 months to repair and I used it one night and it is broken again. Big money for only two uses. Do not buy this product!!!!"
2,Like most Chauvet stuff it broke,"This thing leaked fog juice all over my speakers while it worked and then overheated and died. I tried to contact Chauvet three ******* times to locate a replacement thermostat and got no response at all. Do not buy products from Chauvet, they pray on people like me that are too lazy to return things."
2,Fogger is great...but the pump keeps burning out,"The fogger arrived with a burned out pump. Chauvet was easy to work with to have it shipped back, repaired, and returned to me. I used it 4 times and it worked great...until the pump burned out again. They should really address this issue."
1,Bad Quality,This is like the 4 time I boug an item from Chauvet. I use my fog machine like 5 times and now does not work. And i handle all my items with care but all my chauvet buys had bad at all.
4,Excellent blaxpoitation,"I happened to catch Slaughter's Big Ripoff on cable late one night and I was pleasently surprised. I've always been a fan of the genre, although none will ever top Pam Grier's Coffy, and I was happy with this purchase. Jim Brown will always be the face of the Cleveland Browns, but once upon a time he dabbled in some acting (see The Dirty Dozen). He tears through the bad guys and ladies with equal measure, and Stella Stevens is excellent as the woman always there with a smile and warm bed. These are two pretty good movies and they come on two discs, it's not two movies compressed onto one DVD. Enjoy."
5,Great book and great way to honor Kelley,"""Star Trek: Doctors Orders"" is definately one the finest Star Trek Books. It was the first Star Trek book I ever read and it really turned me on to Series. As you know DeForest Kelley himself, very sadly passed on Friday. I then thought of this book and how it is a great way to rememeber and honor the man who told a good joke on Star Trek when it was needed the most. DeForest Kelley will always be rembered, and ""Doctors Orders"" is a wonderful tribute to him !"
5,well done!,"As I read more and more of the old Star Trek books, I have come to realize that anything written by Diane Duane is going to be a winner. This book is no exception. She is able to present the family aspect of the Enterprise crew much better than most. In this story, the command structure is much more apparent than in other stories, due largely in part by the plot device of leaving McCoy in command of the Enterprise. The Doctor handles it well and with good humor. As with Duane's other Star Trek books, linguistics plays a significant role in the story line. I really should read some of her non-commissioned work."
4,Very different,"Very different and interesting novel, it's fun to see the good doctor doing something different. English is not my first idiom, I speak spanish and live in Peru, so sorry for the mistakes. But buy the novel."
4,Just what the Doctor Ordered,"I was a bit hesitant about buying Doctor's Orders just because I hadn't really gotten in to the book side of Star Trek. However, I really enjoyed this book, the plot is cohesive and the characters are well within their bounds. There isn't a lot of extra background information or from what I could tell any reference to other books. The only complaint/confusion is the kindle format appears to not like 'special characters' and one of the alien races names may use a character and instead it comes through as a ;. It's a little wonky the first time you see but eventually you become used to it.Definitely an enjoyable first read of the Star Trek books."
1,Excellent Customer Service by Discount Jungle,"Although the Yamaha did not work and I had to return it, Discount Jungle returned my phone calls and emails immediately with excellent customer service. Greatly appreciated. They've got my future business."
4,Funk + Rap = Good,"DJ Magic Mike is a skilled madman. This is a great funky album, and one where Mike has a good rapper (Smooth) to work with. If you haven't heard DJ Magic Mike before, while this isn't his best album (that would likely be the watershed ""Bass is the Name of the Game""), it's still a great showcase for him.Album highlights are the humorous mixing of ""It's Star Time"" (any song sampling Bugs Bunny is great), the funk humor of ""Last Person to F*** With"", the ska-ish funk rap of ""Rhyme After Rhyme"", and the smooth R&B-ish; ""Through the Years"" (although the version on ""Bass: The Final Frontier"" is better).Plus you have to love any artist that dedicates an entire track (""To the Fans II"") to thank those who've supported him."
1,105 minutes of your life you will never get back,"Pro: Shannon Rossiter is in the movie and very cute (sorry to say you do not get to see much of her)Con: This movie is like a never ending train wreck. You start off excited to see a lesbian movie, which quickly turns to ""I hope this gets better"", closely followed with ""well at least its almost over"" But its not. Its the movie that will never end. They keep setting it up to end then it continues. When you finally finish the movie you just sit there stunned watching the credits fly by...not because it was some great twist ending, or even a great ending in general...but because you can not believe you just wasted 105 minutes of your life that you will never get back. You could have felt more productive watching your dog chase his own tail for that whole time...it would have been more entertaining."
3,Maggie & Annie,"This is a fun and cute, indie type film. It can be a little unrealistic in terms of some of the conversations that take place and the lack of reaction or emotion in these conversations, but at the end of the day it is another lesbian film so you have to love it. (The sound changes mid-scene can be a little annoying though)If you are looking for a movie to give you an idea of how things might unfold if a married woman falls for another woman - this probably isn't the movie for you due to just how unrealistic it seems."
2,Maggie and Annie - not your typical romance,"I've seen a lot of lesbian romance movies. Some are cute, some are steamy, some are full of angst and unrequited love.This one is none of those things. As it strives to convey a sense of reality, a sense that not all decisions are easy, and that some can love more than one person, it loses focus.From poor sound quality (had the TV all the way up and still missed out) and the dark scenes (left me guessing at what we were viewing in some cases) to the predictable but tragic ending, this is not something that I'd recommend.Spend your money on Bound or Chutney Popcorn."
1,Eh..........,"I guess anyone with a camera and a crappy script can release a DVD. The director should be put to sleep for for making this movie two hours too long. The sound is so horrible, the backround music is so loud most of the time you can't even understand what the actors say."
1,just when you thought it couldn't get worse,"After you get through the awful sound quality and stereotypical characters you reach the most preposterous, horrific ending ever seen. Wow. Truly, absolutely, actually terrible."
5,fun book for anybody to read,"being a 32 year old skateboard enthusiast (going on 18 years), i could feel myself re-living my past. he brings back the essence of what skateboarding is, was, and ""will be"" all about. i've had the wonderful opportunity to meet, and skate with this great author, and he truly does have a passion. the book is a part of his energy, and an element of the soul of skateboarding. i would urge anybody interested in skateboarding, or what skateboarding is about, to buy it. A+ jocko!"
4,"don't give them what they want, give them what they need","Echoes many of my sentiments from the early days.As for the days surrounding my involvement, it is how I remember it, and how I intended it.That never happens, but it did in this book, and I don't even know this guy, and never talked to him. He did use some of my photos without asking me though, and I never got a dime. I can be reached through Thrashers publisher, in the event there is a check waiting for me, and no where to mail it."
4,"Bones Brigade, and Santa Monica Airlines",Jacko Weyland story is part skateboarding history and part life story. It's a nostalgic return to the innocence of skateboarding. The times where just seeing another skateboarder instantly made you friends. For those of us in our late 20's and early thirty's it's a nice time to think back on.
3,Good content. Uninspired presentation. Copyediting anyone?,"As a lifelong skateboarder, I was stoked (yes, I said 'stoked') to see a book like this come out. And I retained my stoke during the book's introduction. The introduction could stand alone as an inspired and revelatory essay.But after slogging through the first few chapters, I couldn't go on. I found the writing style to be simultaneously dry and overwritten. A bit of a feat really. It often feels as though the author's writing style was to get through a checklist of datapoints.The Answer Is Never states data without inspiration or revelation. So while it achieves textbook status, it omits the quizes at the end of each chapter.The editing is flat, and the copyediting is dismal. Mislaid lines of text and typos abound."
5,"Hi, Elliot!","Hi, Elliot! I can't wait to read your book! Please write back, because I'd like to discuss with you ""The Manual of Good Luck."" You're a phenomenal person and and inspiring writer."
2,Too much compression!,"They started making this sports bra differently--it has poorly designed back SNAPS, not hooks, that come undone all the time, so much that I wound up cutting them off. And I'm 56 years old with saggy 36C breasts, and the largest size, C/D 34 - 36 is very tight. I probably won't purchase again unless they change the design."
1,Boooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ing,"In general computer books are not exciting read, but this book takes it to a new level. Poorly written without good examples. It talks about a function and what it does, but leaves you in the dark on HOW it is done. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book.If I could of given it a 0 star rating I would of."
2,15 original Artists sing out of 21 titles listed!,"I learned a lesson on these ""older"" compilations: Listen to all available audio 1st, before buying. It sounds like there are only 15 original artists singing on this CD. 2 are questionable. It's a good mix of long lost songs, so consider the price in your decision. The ""knock-offs"" are mostly pretty bad!"
1,Original Artists?,"Several of the songs on this CD are ""re-recorded"" versions. Anytime you see an individual's name (Jerry Corbetta) instead of the group (Sugarloaf) you should be concerned that it may not be the original versions of the songs. Also, when the label is ""Madacy Records,"" it warrants closer scrutiny to be sure you're getting the original artist AND the original recordings, if that is what you are after."
1,Not worth buying,"My interest in the mafia was sparked by the book, ""For the Sins of My Father,"" and since then, I have been adding to my collection. I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library versus buying it. I didn't even make it past the first 50 pages before I grew too frustrated with the author's (unique?) style of writing. Although it is extremely in depth and detail-oriented, the excessive amount of words confuse the reader and cause he or she to forget the true meaning the behind the sentence in the first place! Not worth my money, but perhaps borrow the book from another before purchasing it..."
1,"Um, no.","Sack here bit off way more than he could chew. He had all the resources needed for writing a great story except talent. ""Bland"" comes to mind; so does ""contrived."" Moreover he shows neither sensitivity nor genuine understanding of Asian culture and the traditions of the hei sh'e hui (Chinese triads).I regret buying this book. The true story of Jonny Kon would have been much mroe brilliantly handled by a veteran writer. Sack's interview and contacts with Kon turned out to be a pathetic waste of an incredible opportunity."
1,Unpolished and not worth it.,"Rhem is clearly a home effort. I bought this in a store for $25, and I expected the gem the reviews promised, but I was greatly disappointed.Firstly, the resolution of pictures in the game is tiny, and there's no way to change to even a 1024x768 mode. Since my monitor doesn't even have a resolution low enough to full screen the images, I was stuck wincing at a tiny image centered in a black screen.The graphics are sub-Myst, even 11 years later, and further make the exploration of the 'world' difficult.The story isn't altogether enticing---I never got far enough to learn more than to see a character basically tell me, ""this is Rhem; I'm leaving; you're stuck.""The puzzles, as was mentioned in another review, also make little sense in the context of the world, with the exception of some of the water puzzles which were fun.Don't buy this game---at least not until it costs about $7 max."
2,Major Confusion,"I haven't been able to figure out any of the puzzles. There's so many paths to take that it's easy to get turned around or lost. It would have been better if there was a way to ""mark"" the paths already taken and a way to get hints on solving the puzzles. It's just way too much thrown at you all at once."
1,Terrible,"Every scene in this game looks the same so it's too hard to navigate. The best grafic in this game is the one on the box, the ones in the game are unimpressive at best.The Myst games are awe inspiring, this game is nowhere close to that."
2,Pitiful!,"This game, the minute i put it in, was horrible...i wish that i hadnt paid 29.99 for this! Myst, Riven, Exile, Riddle of the Sphynx and Omega Stone are so much better!DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"
4,"vast world, great puzzles, no story","I would say that Rhem compares favorably to Myst and its successors in terms of landscape and puzzles, but it does lack any compelling storyline.The deserted industrial setting, composed of pumping stations, generators and radio complexes, is dilapidated and needs repair so that you can find a vehicle to escape. It is similar to one of the ages of Myst, but is even more incredibly vast. Much of your energy will be devoted to mapping out the various locales and routes.The puzzles are very good, and you'll need to note down colors, shapes and symbols that become essential in later settings. At some point I did become quite frustrated when I was STILL putting so much effort into finding my way between sites, but ultimately I would say that I enjoyed the game, it was MYST-like, and if there were a Rhem 2, I would play it."
5,Mystical World,"I enjoyed the time it took to finish the game with the depth of mazes, and puzzles. This is a game that does not offer instant gratification, but is enjoyed over a number of days. The puzzles make sense, and the worlds fit together nicely.Recommended and enjoyed for all gamers looking to add some adventure to their summer days."
2,Goniometer - difficult to read!,"I purchased the Gollehan Extendable Goniometer. It's really nice that you can extend the ""arms"" on this goniometer, but it's really hard to read the degrees. The numbers are located inside/behind a small window. The window is too small so one needs to remove the goniometer from the patient and angle it so one can read the exact number - without bending or moving the arms at the same time. Very annoying and takes more time than with just an ordinary goniometer. Vey sad, because the idea is so good!! But it needs more adjustment to be an excelent measuring tool."
2,spiderman action,"this dvds start off fast and exciting the color is good but the story lines seem to run together and before you know it the dvd is ending such story lines as the green goblin run to long. also where are the orther villians. such as rhino and electro and orther that spiderman fans have come to love this is a quick fix by marvel to give you a small taste only to intice you to by the main disk 67 collerction,"
2,3 Cd,"Why this is relase in Europe,10 disc 1310 minutes for 20 pound like 30 dollars and we get 3 disc 200 minutes and 100 to 300 hundred dollas for a porcion of this season this is bs"
4,Worth the smile on my sons face!,The Spiderman collection served its purpose as my son was very happy to watch and pretend he is spiderman and/or his enemies. The Spiderman collection should involve every Spiderman DVD from that series as it is somewhat confusing when ordering and not knowing which DVDs actually come in the collection series. Overall I rate the series w/a passing grade.
1,Bad Footage,"When I ordered this DVD, I was expecting to have some of the footage that was shown on TV that day and the following morning. Footage like the first airplane crashing into tower one, or one of several scenes of the second plane hitting tower two.I was expecting to see the collapse of both towers. None of this was on this DVD, with exception to the second plane hitting which used the most obscure shot available.I wanted to listen to the President's response shortly after the attack. I wanted to hear who was responsible, how the plan was executed, and who was involved.Overall my opinion is that this DVD [stinks] big time. I wasted my money on a shotty DVD that only brings heatbreaking stories of people at Ground Zero that day. This is a very disapppointing DVD. ..."
3,It's Not That Bad,"The 9/11 DVD is OK. The DVD was ment to show what it was like on the ground that day and it does. The first 35min. of it is great, after it drags out. Hate to use the word boring, but you'll loose interest fast towards the end. It's not a complete dud as a documentary."
3,America 911 - We Will Never Forget,"Of all the 9/11 documentaries I've seen, this one is the least graphic & the most boring. It's mediocre in my opinion. If you're sensative to the 9/11 attacks in New York City & you want a 9/11 video without all the graphic material, then I insist that you get this one. But if you think you can handle the real deal, then watch ""In Memoriam, New York City, 9/11/01,"" which is the most powerful, unnerving, and moving documentaries of all the 9/11 videos that I've seen."
1,America 911: We Will Never Forget,This DVD is a DUD. I thought it would be more detailed as to the events as they happened. I also thought it would include the first reactions of President Bush and Mayor Giuliani. I was extremely disappointed. I rate this five thumbs DOWN.
1,"Truly, Done in bad taste","I recently saw this video and to my dismay I was dissapointed to see a video this bad on amazon.com. After watching ""REAL"" news broadcasts and news stories I though this would be a more up-close in-depth view of what really happened on Sept 11th. I can only hope all the donations are being given to the Red-Cross. I would hate to think this video was put on the market just for sales. Alot of people lost their lives that day and this video seems to capatalize on that. The story narration was so bad I turned down the volume and watched the video which was ok at best. If you want to have some sort of keepsake on that day record your local newscast or buy the photo book from Rreuters it will be 10 times better. In my opinion a poor quality video made by people who know nothing about telling a story."
4,"mix of brute force, virtuosity and skewed humor",I liked the record. Heard it on the radio{Newry Highwayman} and bought the cd. I was amazed at the wonderful polyrythmic perversity of the music. Try it you'll like it.
4,"San Antonio, you don't have a clue","...As I just wrote about Death by Rhubarb, I enjoy Heaven and the other characters in the series. As any developing mystery series I expect the characters to expand as the series does. If you find out everything about a character at the beginning of the series what is there to discover later? Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus."
3,TOO MANY COOKS,"REVENGE OF THE BARBEQUE QUEENS, the second in Lou Temple's Heaven Lee culinary mysteries, suffers from overload. Along with the requisite recipes, Temple infuses a little too much pandering narrative and a fairly simplistic mystery with not too many surprises. Coincidences once again land Heaven as a prime suspect in the murders of a nasty barbeque champion named Pigpen and a noted cook book author. She's aided once again by her passle of friends and while the book is certainly inoffensive, it's not as much fun as the first entry."
5,"fun, occasionally goosepimply, romp","I really have to disagree with the previous readers' comments. This book is well written, funny, and entertaining."
1,Not original artists,All of the songs on this album are great except for one thing. None of them are performed by the original artists. I bought this album for one song and was very disapointed that it was not by the original artist.
4,A mixed resource,"Lots of quotations in this book -- many too short or of dubious distinction to include in a wedding ceremony (do you really want to quote a TV or movie character in your wedding?? I don't). The material unique to this volume seemed as if it would be much more useful as humorous or thoughtful snippets to use in the wedding program or toasts. The poetry and short readings are largely selections that you can find elsewhere (many of them the usual suspects), so the real contribution of this book is in the more popular cultural references mentioned above, if your sensibility tends that way.The thematic/contextual organization is strong and fairly comprehensive -- covering not only the ceremony, but also other kinds of ""words"" performed at a wedding, such as toasts. I'd suggest using this book with a more substantive and original anthology, such as Into the Garden."
4,Really useful,"This is a great book; packed with a huge variety of quotes, poems, excerpts. Perhaps my one complaint is that many of the quotes are too short to be used as readings, if that's what you're looking for. But overall the book uses a wide range of creative sources (movies, love letters, poetry, plays, etc.) and will give you lots of ideas and starting points for elements of your own wedding."
1,EP filler ruined by rap warring...,"It's usually hard to go wrong with Magic Mike. DJ Magic Mike is always very talented, but this is... the wrong album. If you're a completist, go for it, but if you're an idle fan this is probably the worst choice.It's not any kind of showcase of his skills. ""Twenty Degrees"" teases you with how funky he can be, but is overladen by verbal defense of his skills. ""Lower the Dynamite"" will make your subwoofer earn its keep, but the added rap track is ... ignorable at best. Generally, the album contains way too much talking and rapping in defense of himself or to put other rappers down, and it isn't done interestingly nor well. I would highly recommend against this album, and suggest that any other album by DJ Magic Mike would be a *much* better choice."
2,very limited history of the religion,"This books falls very short of my expectations. Instead of reviewing ancient religions, and how they became transformed and adapted, the book concentrates on a few European predecessors, some of which may have given rise to some of the practices in use today."
5,Killer PNY,"I used it as a Certified Memory module on a first time when acquiring DDR Motherboard from EPoX. It was an EP-8KHA+ motherboard, and I shoehorned the PNY D256M6421OPT module, and got SPEEDY memory access and loading, it runs twice as fast as PC133 SDRAM, and I would use it for ANY DDR266 motherboards I build for my clients! As always, I'd recommend CERTIFIED (No KNOCK-OFFS) Motherboards AND Memory Modules for SEAMLESS operations regardless of the OS you use, such as Windows (98,NT,2000,XP), and Linux in all flavors. This is a must!"
4,Laura Fygi does Japan Pop(J-Pop),"More pop oriented than her last U.S. recordings, Laura has such a beautiful voice that you will still be mesmerized by her talent. Many of the songs are by Japanese composers and very upbeat and uplifting. As a fan of J-Pop, blending Laura's voice with this music genre is very enjoyable. A few extra $ for the import cd is definitely worth it for this wonderful performer. Laura, PLEASE tour the states!"
3,a book for all seasons,"Timothy Galpin has written a book that is appropriate for the manager of a small independant organization or the CEO of a multinational corporation. What Galpin points out is that in order for change to work, it must be done with the human element in mind. He emphasizes discipline and honesty as essential attributes and the tool kits at the end of the text are well formulated and organized."
3,"Not a bad collection, but leaves a little bit more to be desired","I really enjoyed watching Transformers as a kid. I bought Seasons 1-4 & thought I had the whole collection. When I found out that there was a Japanese series, I was like ""WOW!"". So I went ahead & bought Transformers: Headmasters. First of all, the artwork is impressive. The disc arragement is okay.My only problem is that you have to rely on the subtitles to know what is being said since the spoken language is all in Japanese. It would have been nice to have an English language selection. Hearing Optimus Prime speaking Japanese, just doesn't sound the same.Still this isn't a bad addition for the avid Transformers collector. Watching these episodes reminds me of when I had some of the toys of the characters featured in the cartoon."
3,Works well,"I am relatively happy with the Jeep Garage Park Stop Light. It does the job it says it will do. I am not happy, however that the manufacturer does not offer the AC adaptor as an accessory. I wrote to them and they replied that they did not offer an adaptor. I tried a ""universal"" adaptor, but it did not work. I may have to stop using this device because it can become unreliable if the batteries are low."
1,Jeep stop light,I got this to help me park my van in the garage. It only worked correctly for about two weeks and then the lights would no longer come on even when new batteries were put in.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I found this CD when I was searching for the duet version of ""Nobody Wants To Be Lonely."" It was listed as ""Various Artists,"" which usually means the original artists. So, I was very excited about this CD - it contains an excellent variety of songs. I was dissapointed when it arrived - the cover said ""performed by Countdown."" This is a clear mis-representation of the CD by Amazon. I usually avoid these kind of CD's because the singers don't normally do a very good job (think MUZAK). Well, the soundclips from the site sounded decent, so I thought I would give the CD a chance. For the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not too bad - I think I'll keep it."
1,"Good Idea, Poor Quality","I purchased this item for a prop. Several adults tried to piece it together and the pieces were not cut correctly and it did not fit together. It was pretty much useless, even as a simple prop. I doubt it could be used by a child to play with. I know it is labeled as a puzzle, but you should be able to fit it together so it stands on its own. Mine did not do that."
1,nonsence and hearsay,"I thought the book by Kappeler was horrible, i often found that the chapters in the book lead to no point and that often the chapters contridicted themselves. The book really only did good to give a politically biased idea of criminology with many random statisitcs that were from ten years ago or older."
4,Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice,"This book has a mixture of great writing and interesting content. It's very easy to read, and enhances understanding of problems with propaganda and crime."
4,"Gets the job done, but...","This calendar does what I want it to in terms of the week-by-week, but I find that I really miss having times listed each day. And I miss having a monthly calendar at the start to each month. This is a very bare bones week-by-week."
3,Works well but,Not as good as I expected. Mechanically rough and base not as positive as I would have liked. Older sharpeners like this operated very smothly and were better constructed. Being rough to operate puts more force on the base and makes come loose. It still sharpens well and does what it has to do. Maybe in time it will wear in and operate easier.
4,Best Sharpener I've ever seen,"I bought one of these several years ago for my high school classroom. It sharpens pencils beautifully and quickly--just a few turns usually--the cutting wheels must be very sharp and well-made. But, I don't let students sharpen brand-new pencils from scratch--I don't want to dull the blades. The suction mount works very well on a horizontal surface, but it won't hold for long on a vertical surface (and it's surprising how many students can't figure out how to use it). My only complaint is it's not so easy to re-attach the cup after emptying the shavings--it only goes on one way, so it takes a moment to get it lined up properly. I'm buying another one for my home."
1,they don't make 'em like they used to...,"I bought this on sale for 1/2 price at Office Depot, and it's going back tomorrow. I didn't have a problem with the vacuum mount (yet), but it only seems to want to sharpen one side of the pencil, leaving the other half still covered in wood. How does one write with that? I kept sharpening, turning the pencil around to get all surfaces, but I ended up with an incredibly sharp skewer that doesn't write. Is this the only manual left on the market!? What a shame... I don't need one more battery-operated contraption in my house, but I don't think there's any alternative."
4,Suction base works great; Sharpening not quite centered,"After reading the variety of reviews here, we opted for this X-Acto product mainly because there aren't that many options out there. First, it is completely adequate as a pencil sharpener. Second, the suction base holds on tight. Third, the blades or whatever lines the pencil up doesn't quite sharpen the pencil perfectly even all around. This is not a big problem, though perfectionists will find it frustrating. I recommend this product if you need a portable sharpener."
1,Bad alignment,"I bought this for the name, thinking it would be superior. The pencil alignment ring is flimsy and aligns poorly, so the pencils often sharpen off-center. Don't bother buying this one."
1,Why pay more for less?,"I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?*There is also a less expenseive ""Collector's Version"" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the ""Vista Series"" extras.I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???"
3,Portuguese language mistake,No relection on the movies themselves but the item being advertised shows Portuguese as one of the available languages. I purchased it specifically for that reason and when it arrived I was not happy that the language in question is nowhere on any of the 3 movies as either audio tracks or sub-titles. If you want Portuguese look elsewhere. Luckily I don't already own any of the 3 movies so I will keep the package though it is a big disappointment since I wanted to use it for Portuguese practice.
5,"A controversial, intriguing history","The FBI's original mission was to investigate and prosecute only the most serious crimes against the U.S. - but it was a mission forsaken almost from the beginning, and its abandonment has been accompanied by a history of political pressures, divisiveness, and political intervention from a wide range of fronts. Richard Gid Powers is one of the country's leading historians of national security and law enforcement, and in Broken: The Troubled Past & Uncertain Future Of The FBI, he offers a compelling history of both the Bureau and the forces working within and outside of it. Broken is strongly recommended as a controversial, intriguing history that is certain to provoke spirited discussion."
2,Misleading Description,"I bought this ram for my early 2008 macbook which was starting to run a little slow. After I installed both modules and tried to boot my computer all I got was a black screen. After a quick search I found an apple forum page listing the same problem with a similar computer. It will work combined with one of the original modules but not in pairs, because the ram is incorrectly labeled pc2-5300 when it's actual pc2-6400 and NOT backward compatible with the slower pc2-5300 unless paired with a module of the correct speed."
1,Losey,"Put the memory in, did not work per your web site and now my lap top has to go into the shop to get it to work again.$77.99 wasted."
3,Chez Nous,"The books was in perfect conditions, but it did not come with the computer Key. I had alot of trouble because of that."
5,Fool of Love,"For me, Bobby Fuller certainly can't be dead.Because,He made to the best of the Music.Real Music.I don't know,Have you ever listened to the ""Bobby Fuller Four""?But,This ""I Fought The Law and The Other Hits"" album is really very very good just like his other albums.Especially,""Fool Of Love"" song runs in my head.Bobby Fuller and his music always will live all arround of the world.So I can only say that, God Bless You Bobby!Let's listen to the Bobby Fuller Four!!!"
3,Cute Color,"A little wobbly, but I loved the look.We ended up going with an ergo carrier - a fabric frameless backpack or side or front carrier which we love and use often."
1,LaFuma Walkid Backpakc Child Carrier,"The product that was delivered was defective. The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing. I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem. They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-April when the new model comes out. The manufacturer was responsive; however, I was out of pocket $13.00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing. In fairness, Amazon should reimburse me for this $13.00 expense. I did not expect to receive a defective product."
1,Lost Product,I never received the product and had a terrible experience with Amazon trying to get my money back.
5,Loved it!,This is a film about the indomitable human spirit. I found myself wanting to love my family more fiercely after watching Sang Ly's determination to deal with the realities of a very difficult life. The images are beautiful and haunting. I even found the film unexpectedly suspenseful which adds to its appeal for me. I really enjoyed this film.
5,Great story,This author can WRITE! I held my breath when Nathaniel was being interviewed by the cops. I loved the ending. And I want to visit the Apollo.
5,Really good cabin filter,"What can I say about this product, well, it is a filter and it cleans air in your car."
4,Gamboa una vez mas.,"Santiago Gamboa continua con su encantadora prosa. En un libro simple, divertido y elegantemente escrito, Gamboa logra situar al lector en varios pasajes importantes de la historia Colombiana del siglo pasado. La vida del joven Esteban puede ser feliz, pero es aburrida. Contrario ocurre con todos los que se topan en su camino: viven vidas tristes y tragicas pero interesantes. Esto ubica a Esteban como un observador ideal de la evoluci'n de un pais como Colombia.Antes de leer este libro recomendaria leer ""Perder es Cuestion de Metodo"", una novela policiaca en la que Gamboa hace una muy divertida exposicion de todas sus habilidades."
3,Interesting movie with an unexpected bonus item!,"Interesting debut film by Larry Cohen. Has a fascinating spin on race relations in the 1970's. Worth getting for fans of Cohen's work and the excellent performance of Yaphet Kotto. But there's also a real surprise in this disc in the form of a hidden ""easter egg"". From 1965, an unsold (but probably aired) TV pilot, ""You're Only Young Twice"" starring Ed Wynn,Ethel Waters,Andrew Duggan,and Kathryn Hays! This disc is worth it just for this TV rarity alone!"
2,"Close, but not close enough","This battery, although it has the same ratings as the OEM battery, is slightly thicker. It seems to work okay, but its extra thickness means that the battery cover has to be slightly deformed to close properly.If you have an extra-capactiy battery cover, though, this battery would work okay, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one."
1,Did not work in my LG VX3200 Phone,"I purchased this battery for my LG VX3200 phone and had to return it.After I installed it, my phone displayed ""Use Genuine Battery."" I am not sure whether the problem was this particular battery or if it is the type of battery."
3,You get what paid for,"Hey it works, kind of... It doesn't have the adjustable head and wire features like my old Sony brand. Therefore, it doesn't work well in some cars."
3,OK,Don't know if it was my car stereo or the product but it would not stay engaged as my others had done. It spit out like the cassette was ejected no matter what I tried and my older one that finally died never did this.
1,be careful which seller you buy from,"I bought from lusopc and they sent an entirely different adapter from the picture. It rattled and my car player just spits it out. Mind you, I already had an adapter before this that worked perfectly in my car (until I accidently broke it myself). I tried this new one in my home stereo and it worked, sort of... It made this loud grinding sound and the song quality was extremely muffled and had a lot of static. I emailed them about it being defective and they now informed me that they are not ""compatible with all systems."" A cassette adapter not compatible with all cassette players? How? Why wasn't this in the item's description? They sent me another one and same exact thing. With shipping costs you'd probably be better off just looking for one of these on sale at some local store."
1,Krich Could Have Done Better,"This is supposed to be a book about Brazilian music, but it's obvious the author knows nothing about the subject. He meets some of the most illustrious names in MPB, yet asks inane questions or tries to be funny at their expense. Many times it seems as if he had never heard the music of the person he was interviewing. In addition, each page is full of factual errors and misspelled Portuguese words. If you like Krich's flippant writing style you may like the book. But if you want to learn about Brazilian music, go elsewhere."
1,The Worst Book Ever About Brazilian Music,"Superficial, lame, irritating and full of mistakes. Why was this even published?"
2,"Price is right, but ends are troublesome","I had the same trouble as many others are with the ends not fitting well. The pleather is too hard and thick, so it doesn't stay in the groove on the strap mount. After a couple of near-drops I threw the strap away. If you have a nice guitar just get a good strap, not worth saving a few bucks only to drop and damage a nice instrument."
2,Too short !,"If you are above average height it might be too short (even whet it is fully extended), otherwise decent quality for a price."
5,Cheap Guitar Strap,"For $7, you can't ask more from a guitar strap. I did have quite the difficult time putting on my guitar, but I am not having the issues of it falling off my guitar like some others have had. This strap is definitely nestled in quite well.I would definitely recommend this purchase if you are looking for a cheap guitar strap."
4,its good,Nice strap for the price. Looks nice and quality seems nice. Like the pic holder on front. of the strap.
4,Good cheapie strap,"I'm not going to gush over this one...it simply works well for the price paid. It has nice thick leather ends that hold onto my guitar well enough(especially if you use locking clips...you DO use them, right? ;)). I like it and will use it again."
5,Really Nice.,A little nicer than I thought it would be. As far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it. I like the pick pocket too. But don't let the pocket be the selling point. It's not that cool.
3,Not a bad strap,"Well, here's what i have to say, this strap is much shorter than im used to, but seeing how I bought this for an off guitar, that's ok. They really should put the length in the description, the length is 53"" max, where I like my straps to be 64"" max.It is a hard strap to get on the guitar, (I do not suggest getting this strap withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Nickel), these are great locks, BUT almost impossible to install on this strap.Overall great buy for a cheap little money saver."
3,Protec Guitar Strap,"Good value but a little rough in use. Still a great buy! I like the strap button holes, they are very tight and should hold the guitar firmly!"
3,basic strap - one side hole too tight,"good, useful basic strap - one side fits o.k, but the hole on strap was too tight on the other side (bottom of guitar)"
5,Affordable Strap,"I was looking for a simple strap without to many bells and whistles, and I came across this. It does what it should! I was worried that the strap may not be long enough because I am a tall guy, but it fits well. The leather ends seem sturdy. While it is a bit difficult to get on and off the guitar, this just means that my instrument is safe. I would definitely recommend this strap to anyone looking for a simple strap that does what it is supposed to."
2,OK Strap,"The strap was cheap, but I would have hoped that it would have at least stayed on the guitar. My son has been having problems with the guitar coming off the strap and falling to the floor. I guess we will be looking to get a different strap. It is worth a look for the price, but be aware that you may have trouble getting the guitar to stay strapped in."
3,Not bad,This strap would be phenomenal if it was a little longer. But don't get me wrong I still think that this is a great deal for just 5 bucks. So I would actually recommend this to another person. I'd even gift this to somebody.
4,Good inexpensive guitar strap,It will adjust to the length you will want and it will stay attached to your guitar (no fear of it falling off). My only negative comment is the leather strap connections make a squeak sound when they move on the knobs. But I have never owned a guitar strap before so I don't know what more expensive ones are like.
4,Good,"Product arrived quickly and in good condition. Note that unless you have a peg installed on your acoustic you will also need some string (or a shoelace) to tie the end up by the pegs. Overall, product functions as advertised and I am pleased with purchase."
4,Good Choice,it was as described and on time but would have been bette iif one end of the strap would release easy.
4,Durable and Value,Nylon is strong enough and doesn't chafe. But it does stink a little out of the package. Let it air out a few days in the sun! Warming it up also makes it easier to attach to guitar.
3,"First the bad news, then the good...","The bad news is that you will need a crow bar to pry the strap ends onto the studs. The good news is that should you manage to get the strap on, it will NEVER come off.Otherwise, a rather plain, heavy duty, plasticky strap with plasticky ends."
4,great!!!! :D,this is a great. It is a little bit too hard to get on the pegs but won't fall off. the pick pochet is really cool. it is easy to adjust and looks great!!!!>>>>> :D :D :D :D :D :D
4,Basic ugly strap with convenient pocket.,"This is an ugly strap that is perfect for an ugly guitar. I have one such ugly guitar, and it's a match. It would be better if a lanyard were included for acoustic applications, but, my drawstring from my worn out gymshorts does the trick and adds to the ugly. Everything I needed, while leaving cash in my wallet."
3,Not a big fan but it is cheap,Protech usually makes good stuff but this strap needs help at the ends. Slot should be bigger and made of a less stiff material. It will work but it is a paint to put on and take off.
3,"good value, good luck getting it on and off your guitar...","It's cheap, and it seems well made for the most part. However, I have a dozen different instruments and only half as many straps, so I tend to switch my straps quite a bit, and this one is not very amenable to that. Each end is VERY tough and getting the holes over the buttons can be an enraging task...though perhaps comical to onlookers. In other words, highly recommended for a cheap solution if you are going to use one strap for one guitar or bass...but not so much if you're going to switch it out, because it just takes too much time and effort..."
2,Not great,"I was not impressed with this strap. The end pieces are far too thick and hard to get over a strap button. I had to use a box cutter to make the hole larger just to get the strap on an instrument. The strap material itself is too slick on a t-shirt to actually support the instrument, at least for heavier instruments like an LP or bass.I gave it two stars because it is as advertised and it looks well made despite the questionable choice of materials."
3,Doesn't Fit Guitar,"I ordered this for my son's guitar because the one he had broke. Unfortunately, it didn't fit. There wasn't enough information for me to know up front if it would actually fit the guitar or not. The product itself is a good quality product.I did not return the item because shipping is too expensive in my opinion."
2,Very difficult to put on guitar!,I wasted like 30 minutes to merely put the strap on the guitar. I eventually had to use a knife to make the holes bigger.
1,Music 123 sent the wrong item.,I ordered a guitar strap to go with my electric guitar for my 6 year old. They sent me a tiny lock for a guitar case which I didn't buy. They charged me more for shipping than the price of the guitar strap. I keep trying to get them to send the item I ordered that shows up on my Amazon order as the Guitar Strap but they say the item # was for a lock. Very difficult to work with. I give up. I am afraid to order anything else from Music 123 don't know what I'll get or be charged. Do not order from them!!!!!!
1,Never get this product,"I never get this product, i got e-mail that this item slready sent. But until this time about almost one month I never get it"
4,good strap,"Shipped and arrived on time, good quality and very nice construction. Priced right with plenty of room as Im not a lil guy so I was worried about that! Thanks Amazon, your my go to guys for stuff I gotta have!"
5,Durable and top quality Product,Just Grab it. This speaks quality....No doubt. I just got this yesterday for my Mini Esquire and I am very delighted to see that it seems to be made for my Guitar. Just Awesome!
4,Pro Tec POLYSTTX Electric Guitar Strap,"I primarily chose this strap because of the builtin pick holder. Also, its a great value at the low price. I bought two more for my other guitars. A++"
3,pain?,I'm sorry - but this strap sucks; digs into my neck....guess I could say that it's just a pain in the neck! I only gave it a three because it did hold the guitar ......that's it. Alrighty then! Bye bye now.
2,"If there is only one strap lock on your guitar, don't buy this.","Yes, it is not problem of this strap. This strap will be Okay with a guitar that has two strap locks. If your guitar has only one strap, you need to use a string ties around guitar neck, which I do not like. Without a string you can not attach the strap. There is no string included in the package."
4,"This book was a good,inspiring story of a girls life.",This book was one of the best books I have ever read. It was really inspiring to someone whose life just pretty much ended when they were forced to move to a different place then where they were brought up. It also showed lots of emotions that Bron was feeling toward all the people in her life. This book showed me the insides to people. What I mean is that you have to really get to know people before you can say that you dislike the person like Bron had to do with Will. She had to get to know him because at first she didn't like him.
5,Long Lasting and Durable,"I bought this belt for my husband about 10+ years ago. He is a police officer so he needed a belt that would last. After 10+ years, I finally had to buy him a new belt.This belt is thick and very durable - well worth the money"
5,Truly an excellent belt.,"Don't buy this belt expecting it to fit dress pant loops, and make sure you order the right size the first time.This is a *real* belt, with real thickness. The buckle is just as large and bulky as it looks. This belt is for a pair of jeans or work pants that have to stay up no matter what.Surprisingly easy to put on despite being somewhat less flexible, there is no problem wearing it. I can fully believe this belt will be with me years from now.An added benefit; the buckle must be aluminum or something, because it made it through an airport sensor with no problem.Indestructible Belt"
1,NOT so indestructible,"6 Months later this belt has been retired. Did it last longer? perhaps 25%.... Did it look good doing it? Not really, it looked pretty shabby after month 2. Considering it cost about double what I usually spend I cannot recommend it."
5,Belt Review,"The Indestructible belt is good quality and looks good too. I don't know yet if it is really indestructible, but it seems to be holding up well."
2,Purchase of a Leather Belt,"The price of the belt was fine; the belt, however, was poorly madebecause the belt did not fit through the belt buckle easily. It isserviceable, but difficult to use."
4,Excellent for what it is,"Do you want an introduction to algorithms and data structures without a lot of really intense math? Do you already know Java reasonably well? Do you no mind skipping over lengthy descriptions of unit tests? If you answered ""yes"" to all those questions, then this is a great book. I came away with a much deeper understanding of the topics covered and I found it engaging and easy to read."
2,Trish Stratus Home Video,"We have learned nothing new about Trish Stratus in the movie, everything we already know about her is in the video so not really informative.- Behind the scenes footage was interesting probably the best part of the movie.- The extras aren't much but probably the best features on the dvd.Being a WWE fan I really was kind of disapointed in the DVD, it could have been a lot better.I suggest just finding a fansite with caps from the DVD or videos, I wouldn't spend money on it. I'm kind of upset I spent the money I did on it, it wasn't worth it.Trish Stratus fans will deffinitely try to convince you to buy it but wait for more reviews that aren't so good, they're the ones you want to focus on."
4,A great story from Trish Stratus.,"I love Trish Stratus so much. Ever since she retired for WWE., things have been different. She is one of the greatest Divas ever in WWE history!"
3,Not that stratisfied...,"I was happy with the shipping, and the seller. I was not too pleased with the product itself though. I felt as though there should have been more depth to her interview, and the extras sucked. There were like 4 matches and the rest of the extras were boring and idk, they just didnt do much for me. Unfortunately, this product gave me only a little stratisfaction ;T"
3,Not Bad,"I'm more of a fan of womens wrestling, rather than a fan of Trish Stratus, but this dvd was on Amamzon for $7 so I thought I wouldn't be losing out on much if it wasn't any good.In the end I'm glad I bought it. I found it interesting, learning about Trish's start in fitness modelling, etc. The rest I pretty much knew already. There are probable a few too many interviews with members of her extended family. Also, I would have liked a few more matches in the extras section. There are 10 extra matches on Lita's dvd, and only 4 on this one.Anyway, my advice is, if you're a fan of womens wrestling, and if the price is low, then this is a good buy."
3,Decent look at Trish,"While not the greatest behind the scenes DVD, I am sure there are worse. Trish Stratus went from behind strictly T & A to actually being a very good performer. Keep in mind that this came out in 2003, about three years before her retirement in 2006 so there is a lot to her WWE story that's missing.That being said, I liked hearing and seeing her family members and her career as a fitness model before her foray into pro wrestling. You get a brief glimpse into her evolution as both a personality and a performer. I hope her career is re-visited one day to get a complete look.As a man, I like all women regardless of background but I am biased towards sistas and ethnic women. Trish could DEFINITELY make me make an exception! She was that fine to me and, as I said, could actually perform in the ring beyond showing off her bod! Not a recommended view BUT is worht a look if you can find it for around $15 or lower."
3,Nothing Special,"This movie seems to be getting good and bad reviews, the good ones make no sense to me. I watched the full DVD and extras and believe me folks, this is just your typical movie that repeats itself.Trish Stratus is a great woman no doubt, but the movie wasn't all that great and thank god for extra content! The movie would be nothing without the extras..which aren't that good either but lets just roll with it shall we?--Trish Stratus was hardly seen talking during the movie part it was all family, friends, etc. Why not hear from the woman herself?--The DVD was not what I expected at all, with all the contest listed under the descriptions before I bought it I figured we'd have a great movie here, but did it ever occur to anyone as to why there is so much extras? Because the regular video part was pointless.--I don't reccommend this WWE DVD the following are the wrestling home videos I do recommend.*Stone Cold Steve Austin*Kurt Angle*Lita*Hardy Boys*Triple H"
1,Why?,"Of all the WWE Divas, Trish Stratus is the least worthy of a DVD. While the WWE could be releasing a video of an actual wrestler, they waste one on Trish. The DVD includes most likely a life story, how she got into the business, etc., which most WWE fans could care less about. And if the bonus material is her matches, don't waste your time watching them because she is a horrible wrestler. I hate to tell you, but if you buy this DVD, you're not a wrestling fan, you're a T&A fan. And if the WWE was going to release a T&A DVD, Trish wouldn't be on it. Have more fun watching Victoria, Molly, and Nidia, and those with talent."
2,trish status 2 hot 4 dvd's now,i didn't c da dvd but i bet it was hot because trish status is hot whatever she does wil be hot
4,Great,"This is a good dvd but I would like to see more matches, interview and more. If you are a fan on her buy it. Rating 8/10."
5,A really fun movie for the boys book club to watch together,I turned this set of dvd's on during a backyard barbeque for my son's book club. It is a group of 8-13 yr olds. It kept them engaged and excited to learn new violent free sports.
4,Good,This is akin to traditional Scandinavian fold music. Nicely executed: vocal and instruments are great. It can be a bit depressing at time though.
3,Vittrad Is Hit and Miss,"The first full length disc by Swedish folk rockers Garmarna showcase their flare for combining dark, old world ballads with modern rock twists.This is a band that still has a lot of room to grow and they seem unsure of what to do with singer Emma Härdelin, who was new to the Garmarna fold at the time; most of the brief tracks here are instrumentals (Emma does play fiddle and flute) and only a handful have vocals. The best of those are Den Bortslda (a classic!) and Straffad Moder & Dotter. Emma's voice is raw and the band play pretty conservatively -- they show very little of the stretching out that would come on later releases.The brevity of the individual tracks works against the album, but taken on the whole it is a nice listen and is a great step back in time as well. The band would go on to do better things but this album is still worth having for the aforementioned tracks, as well as other tracks such as Vittrad and Klevabergselden."
2,lonely house,I purchased one @ Smith & Hawkens over a year ago. Sadly no bird has ever nested in it. I've never even seen a bird enter it. I've tried various hights and locations throughout my yard to no avail. It makes me sad because it LOOKS great.
2,Worthless for non community college students.,"If you currently attend a community college hoping to attend your state university, and know very little about the college admissions process, this is the book for you! If you are like me, looking at elite colleges and knowing the way the system works fairly well, this book is a waste of time. It is written at about a 4th grade level, making it so I could get through the entire book in about an hour. In addition, it only provided the basics, and left me with no new insights. There is far better information on the web, I am sorry I wasted my 10 bucks!"
5,An excellent guide for transfer students,"Transferring to a new college can be a daunting and frustrating task. In this lucid and up-to-date book, Professor Eric Freedman makes this process as efficient as possible. It is a valuable resource for every student who is transferring to a new college, or who is thinking of doing so."
5,excelente,"ES EL MEJOR LIBRO QUE YO E LEIDO EN MI VIDA LEI EL 1 Y EL 2 Y NO TENDRIA PALABRAS PARA DECIR CUAL ERA EL MEJOR LO RECOMIENDO LEANLO CON TODA LA CONFIANZA Y APRENDERAN MUCHO SOBRE :SEXUALIDAD, MASTURBACION,ENFERMEDADES VENEREAS, MATRIMONIO,LUNA DE MIEL,NOVIAZGO ETC.........."
5,Excelente libro.,"Este es un libro excelente para jovenes con edad entre los 12 y los 20 annos. Esta lleno de los grandes valores que lamentablemente se han ido perdiendo. Lo recomiendo con la seguridad de que quien lo adquiera, no se va a arrepentir."
4,Very Good,This is a very absorbing read for the teen romance reader. Has good characters and fun atmosphere. Enjoyed this very much.
4,Florida rap w/ a political twist,This c.d. is truly awesome. Well thought lyrics by Isaam mixed with the music of DJ Magic Mike. Florida rap at it's finest. The c.d. touches on political problems faced by minorities while including Magic Mike's signiture BASS!
4,Double sound,It works fine. I don't care much for the noise it makes when working but my recordings come out good.
1,Not the actual songs only samples,"Do not order this , this is not the actual songs just samples..amazon needs to get there stuff together"
4,Superb mid-paced eighties metal,"They had an album in the early eighties and died called Fighting for the Earth. It was good and contained their best ever track, the title track but this album is overall much better and more consistent and has an equally good sound as the first. Anybody who likes eighties metal such as Dio, Priest etc will like it, no problem."
4,"Nice, but not perfect",This is my first experience with tournaline technology. I noticed that this ironwas a lot lighter than a traditional iron. I love the heat setting dial; it's impossible to accidently change the temperature. It seems that my hair is softer and more shiny with this iron.My disappointment is that it doesn't seem to clap tightly enough on the hair. I'm African-American and I use the iron to straighten my hair as I'm curling. I have experienced it snagging my hair.
2,Scotland's Golf Guide,"Just ok. This book was last printed in the late 1990s, so much of the greens fee information is out of date. The book seems to lack a real world narrative that might be helpful to the newbie looking for helpful anecdotal information. My two biggest selling points for the book were 1) that it came in hard cover and 2) it had a nice cover photo. Outside of that it moved quickly to the 'golf book shelf' without getting much attention.Disappointing...."
3,Good as a directory of golf courses,I have never been to Scotland and wanted more info than a directory style book.
5,I like them for what they are,"Yes, there are some problems with washing these and they transfer the heat/cold but I already expected that because these are metal straws that are not supposed to be disposable. I like them a lot, great purchase for me as I don't want to put more crap in landfills and I hate plastic."
4,So cool,"Once you see someone using one of these straws, you just have to try one yourself! They're so unique and kitschy, I just had to have them! They are fun and cute, but I do wish they were straight rather than bent. Still, I'm happy with my purchase."
5,SAVE THE EARTH,"I really like the idea of reusing these straws. Several years ago,I stopped buying bottled water because of my concern for the disposal od the plastic bottles. I feel the same way about a plastic straw. And I was very pleased to find that the Stainless straws were available. I have passed along this information to people I know who share my same concerns."
3,I kinda thought they would bend,"Be aware that these are bent into a fixed angle, they are NOT flexible. I was a bit disappointed with that, but overall they are a good quality product. They do conduct heat so if you're drinking a cold beverage they will be cold. Stronger than I expected too, I figured they would be pretty flimsy but they're not (cause I kept trying to bend them and couldn't)"
4,Sipping Green,"In that I use a straw with all cold drinks, when I saw these on Oprah I knew I had to have them. The Endurance Drink Straws are great and help me contribute in some small way to a greener world."
1,Especially Helpful to Counteract Tremors,"These straws are a godsend. I have tremors in my left hand--the only hand I can use, my right hand is affected by cerebral palsy.These straws enable me to maintain my independence, and dignity. I stick several in my purse to make eating out possible/easier. No longer do I spill what I drink due to my tremors.The sturdy construction of the straws combined with the fact that these straws are dishwasher safe reinforces their apt name--these are definitely Endurance straws.I liked these so much that I purchased a second set. I would recommend these straws highly to anyone who has tremors, or dexterity problems in their hands, or arms."
2,RSVP Drinking Straws,"The product I received was not the one I ordered, the ones I ordered were supposed to be 11 inches long the ones I received were 8 inches long, big difference, was dissappointed but kept them anyway."
5,Get enough for EveryOne!,"Ever since the early nineteen-sixties, I've carried a full set of utensils in my purse; knife, fork, spoon, chopsticks, Swiss army knife with corkscrew, can opener and bottle-cap lifter, a collapsable drinking cup and a linen napkin.My mate, children and grandchildren all do likewise.As soon as I saw these straws I realized that they were just what we had been missing!Now we're fully equipped for outdoor events.Here's another tip: The 140 gram World Class Frisbee nests snugly inside of the 160 gram World Class Frisbee making a case that half a dozen stainless steel plates fit neatly inside of!"
5,FANTASTIC!,This is my second purchase of these straws. Love them so much had to get more.Got some for my Mom too. I keep them in the freezer so they are super cold for my iced coffee and sodas. Might even get more later..RSVP Set of 4 Drinking Straws 18/10 S/S New
5,Stainless Steel Straws,"I ordered these straws in July, 2009 and now that I've used them for a couple of months, I can honestly say I love them; they're great for hot and cold drinks as well as contributing in a small way by being environmentally correct. I agree with a previous reviewer stating the way to know that you are really getting the insides clean is with pipe cleaners from the craft store. I wish they came with a little carrying case so I could hygienically carry one in my purse to use while away from home; it kind of takes away from the classy look to pull one out of a baggie. :)"
5,Excellent Straws,Love these straws! This is the second pack that I've purchased -- we wanted more than 4!
2,Great concept but a few flaws,I've been shopping around for reusable straws for a while because I use them regularly. I bought these based on the reviews but the one thing that doesn't seem to be mentioned much is the fact that I get a metallic taste in the beverages when using this straw. Because of this I've discontinued using them.
2,Dishwasher Beware!,"These are pretty to look at - but I hope you don't plan on cleaning them! They are such a small diameter - they fell right through the basket of my dishwasher. So I tried the teeny, tiny, super skinny straw brush...well it only goes part way. The brush WILL NOT push into the curve/bend in the straw. So if you want to spend money on a reusable straw - double-check the hole size of your dishwasher basket OR get the straight straws."
2,Prefer glass,"I am a straw addict and was feeling pretty bad about all the plastic I was using everyday. So, I thought stainless steel would be great. Well, I'm sure it is for some, but not for me. I don't like that you can't see what you're drinking. When you clean the straws you can only hope there's nothing left inside, because you can't see through it. Also, if you hit your teeth you can get that awful metal on teeth zing. Received glass straws as a gift and love them!"
2,I almost chipped a tooth on these straws!,"I frequently use straws when drinking and I thought this would be an eco-friendly choice to plastic straws. They are attractive and have a nice bend in them. However, after hitting my tooth with the straw a few times I stopped using them on a regular basis. I guess I would have to say you must be very careful and thoughtful when using these straws. Definitely not for use in the car. They did work better for sipping smoothies and other frozen or thick drinks than the plastic straws."
3,"Well, not exactly . . .","I supposed it's really my fault for not exploring more deeply. Bought these for frozen frappacinos. Small diameter does not provided for enough suction - you get the cheeks pulled in, the eyes crossed, and no reward for your effort. These would be fine for liquids, but I'll have to keep looking for the heavy-duty super suckers."
3,"Product is 8.5"" including the bend.","The dimensions on the listing here are a bit misleading. What is listed as 11 inches here on the product page is the dimensions of the packaging. I purchased this set of stainless straws thinking each was 11 inches long total, with 8 of those inches being the straight length and the rest being the bend. The actual length from end-to-end is 8.5 inches.3 stars for ""I like it"". They work and I will keep them.I had to search around for the longer size. I purchased:STAINLESS STEEL DRINKING COCKTAIL STRAWS BENT CURVED 11""XL x 1/4""R SET OF 4. They ended up being what I was looking for the first time. Worth the extra cost."
5,Hard to find,"I looked for years for steel straws because my mother had one she loved then lost, then I saw these and knew she would want them. They are strong and durable, she has had them for a few years and still loves them"
4,Good,"Good straw. Gets cold unlike plastic straws, so if you do not like a cold straw I suggest don't buy it."
4,Wish they weren't bent.,"I really like these straws. I'm glad I bought them, and I enjoy using them, especially for their great price. They look good in my mason jar cups, and are fun to drink from. If there was just one thing I would say about them that wasn't perfect, it would be that I wish they weren't bent. I tried to find non-bent ones on Amazon, but could not. I feel like the bend throws it a little off balance in the cup, and while it makes them look nice, I'd rather be able to look through them to see if any gunk is inside. I use a pipe cleaner to wash them, but still.The straws do get cold when you use them in cold drinks, but it doesn't bother me, really, especially not enough to stop using them, or to pay for expensive glass straws."
5,stainless steel drinking straws,"This is the best idea for summer drinks or for that matter anytime. No more disposable straws for me...these will save you money in the long run and they seem to make the drink colder as you sip. Great product! Keep up the good work Amazon, you carry very well made products. Thanks again."
4,Really great.,"Very helpful for my mother who needs a bent straw to drink from. The hard plastic ones - do not bend, the soft plastic ones are easily chewed and then hard to drink from. The down side was the length for the glasses we have (our problem, not the straws) and I would like to be able to bend the straws as needed. For endurance and for ease these are wonderful."
5,Perfect!,"These straws are wonderful. I got 3 sets (12 total) after seeing Oprah's fancy silver straw she always has in her water on the show! These straws are high quality, durable, and have done great in my dishwasher. Highly recommended product.Update: Jan 2011, I'm still loving these straws! They still all look like new, and my guests are always so charmed when I serve them their drinks with a silver straw. These are an absolute must-have for the hostess who wants to be known for having the mostess."
1,Ripped Off,"Anthony More is great. This is some guy recording the sounds of ""Sticks An Whistles"" literally with the same name except for one extra o I didn't notice at first. I am an idiot, but come on sounds of sticks and whistles. How could anyone release this. Then again I'm sure most aren't as stupid as me. After all I am the only one reviewing this piece of crap."
1,Opteka 3.2 telephoto lens,"Desgraciadamente mi experiencia con este lente no ha sido buena. Las imágenes no tienen buena definición, generalmente aparecen ""blureadas""."
4,i actually enjoyed it,"about a subject which we all must face, i thought the two stories which were highlighted in the dvd about 2 diferant peaple who ""died"" and then were resucitated tell their tales of what they experianced on the other side was exellantone a pastor in africa who died for 2 days then was revived,the other a diver stung by a deadly jellyfish,both tell there own facinating stories of journeys to heaven and hell.this is a dvd whith a christian angle all the way through and i thought it was informative,graphic and moving.A ""must see dvd"""
3,REALLY Liked the Diver's Story,"It was an okay production, but I REALLY did like the diver's story. It seemed genuine. Other productions you might consider are Round Trip and The Search for Heaven. I give both of those productions 3 1/2 stars.One of the things this production talks about is forgiveness, which is something I am struggling with now in my own life regarding a sibling and how they are treating my mother. After watching this movie, I need to learn how to forgive while still protecting her from his actions."
5,Good testimonies,These testimonies are great and really stress just how important it is to forgive other people. I thought these were well done.
1,believer 'but...',"No doubt that the near death experience is a real event, but the production and experiences depicted in this documentary are very mediocre. Where's Robert Stack when you need him. His coverage in 'Unsolved Mysteries' is far superior and leaves you with no doubts. Don't bother with this dvd"
2,"Overated, mediocre quality and attempt at fusing genres and styles of music.","I really wanted to like this CD after reading a few reviews but I felt the reviews and testimonials were rather dishonest. I felt the quality of the recordings could have been improved and I felt it was lacking musically. The use of instrumentation, playability and composition could have been improved and found nothing innovative about his music."
3,didn't realize what i was buying,"I bought these for my boyfriend for valentines day thinking they were real golf balls just pink ones. I didn't know they were plastic balls, but i guess that is just because I really don't know anything about golf. he said he would use them to practice with, but they are still in the package over 6 months later."
4,All as expected,The balls were as expected and came on time. Will go through the same process when more are required.What more can I say?
5,"Great lightweight, hollow, plastic, golf balls","For his 2nd birthday, my son received a plastic golf club set that came with 3 balls. He loves them and carries them with him everywhere! It took about a month to lose the 3 balls and he was so distraught I was thrilled to find a cheap replacement! These 12 balls are hollow plastic, they do not pose a choking hazard to my son (he has tried putting them in his mouth)My toddler hits them around the house with no danger of breaking the tv or vases. They do dent if you step on them but that goes with being so lightweight."
2,Practice golf balls,I bought these for my brother to pactice indoors. I Thought I ordered the soft sponge balls but the hard practice balls came instead . I had my brother send them back.
4,Good for practice but not foam,"I bought these for my 7 year old daughter so she could practice with her new golf clubs at home without breaking anything.Like the other reviewer, I was expecting foam but got plastic instead.They are good for practice but the description should be changed to plastic instead of foam because it is misleading."
2,False advertisement,"My product arrived today and did not meet the description. The description states SOLID design practice golf balls. This is not the case. These practice golf balls are hollow plastic, weighing slightly more than a ping-pong ball, although they do bounce just as high. If you are looking for practice golf balls, for indoor use, something that has a realistic ""feel"", these are definitely NOT the golf balls to purchase.Intech solid Practice Balls, 12 Pack (White)"
4,Practice Balls for Kids,"I bought these for my grand daughter, so that she would enjoy practicing with something she can identify with. Good for indoor or outdoor practice."
1,NOT SOLID,"These are plastic and hollow balls, not SOLID, like advertised. If you're looking for ping pong type gold balls, then these are it."
3,Practice balls,Somewhat disappointing as they are very soft and squash easily when hit with a solid club. Advantage is being able to hit it hard and not losing the ball or causing any damage
1,The author is wrong,"The show he is talking about is a great show. Power Rangers teach lessons of life unlike all the other shows (or almost) that I have seen. The problem about this book is that the guy didn't or couldn't look into the real meaning of the show and just looked at the superficial part of it. That part is violent. But the thing is that parents that say that Power Rangers are bad didn't even look at it, so they can't tell their kids what to learn from this show... Those are bad parents since they don't interest themselves at what their kids are doing... I do not recommend this book at all."
2,What I think of the book:,"The Book basically contents the reasons why not to watch the Power Rangers, have good redaction, and elocuent arguments, but, acording with my opinion, it's just another book against a sucessfull serie by attacking it with religion. Acording to the arguments used against PR, all the series of TV are wrong. Instead of be named ""The Truth Abot Power Rangers"" should be called, ""The Truth About the actual TV Shows for children"". The book no only attack the TV shows, but the Martial Arts practice. In my opinion, the Power Rangers give a good mesage to the children, by studing, don't quit the school, and make their best in everything they do, and showing comun troubles among the youth, and how they shouldn't feel guilty about things that aren't their fault, like the parents divoce."
1,Tv is not a babysitter,This guy is #uc!^g nuts! Ok here is the problem some lazy parents use tv as a babysitter. If you let your children watch a show and don't talk about it with them then what they do is your fault not the shows. That being said how do you have a plot with no conflict? You can't have the rangers in vite the monsters over for tea and cookies that would be really boaring. Implied sexual inuendo? I haven't seen that when I watched. Tommy and kimberly were dateing and that was about it.
1,You're... you're kidding right?,"Oh jeez... just what we need. Another ""X popular show/game/movie/book"" is going to RUIN AMERICAN CHILDREN!I wonder just how many parents bought into this bull when Power Rangers was still a big deal..."
1,I do NOT agree with this guy!,"This guy does NOT know what he's talking about. Power Rangers is a great show. It teaches kids moral values, it gets kids interested in martial arts, the acting is great, the directing is great, the plot is great, basically EVERYTHING about Power Rangers is great. I do not recommend this book, and I never will."
1,Focus on some good episodes!,"I highly recommend that insted of buying this book, buy a tape of some classic episodes such as ""Day of the Dumpster"", ""White Light"", ""Island of Illusion"", ""High Five"", ""Where There's Smoke, There's Fire"", and ""Forever Friends"""
5,Great After-The-Hurricane Coverage,"I love Avant Guide for their supercool coverage of restaurants, hotels, bars and sights. This edition doesn't dissappoint because, even after the floods Avant Guide proves that New Orleans remains one of the best cities in the world. If you're looking for a resource that tells it like it is, about where to go and what to do to have a truly unique experience, then this is your guide. I also often travel with Lonely Planet, but it didn't help me at all here."
5,Excellent for my bullie puppy!,He loves it! I trust Royal Canin and know that I am giving him what he needs and I can see him growing and thriving with it! His has also helped his bowels (which were quite frequent and loose from Eukenuba) and the tear stains are not as bad. (Maybe a switch to spring water will help those).I love Royal Canin and will use the bulldog formula when he is an adult!
5,Sheer Fun,"This isn't a brainless game and doesn't drain your brains as well. Combining a simulation, strategy and a little roleplay, all in one Knights and Merchants is a classic of its time! The sound effects (TROOP RIGHT WHEEL ... CHOW TIME!) the music, ambience of the game is enough to make you feel as though you're really in the realm. With building your village and towns you get your simulation genre, with the building of troops and sending them into military positions you get your strategy. It is not all that fast paced, relaxing and just all out plain enjoyable to play.We deserve a sequel. The fans demand it. Or at least, just me."
5,HOMICIDE AND OLD LACE,"THIS SERIES BY DELORES JOHNSON, IS JUST FUN READING. HER CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT."
1,Paint cups,"Adverstized as beng useable for ""175"" & ""200"". I ordered the cup as shown. the cup sent does not properly fit the air brush; it has a distinct bend in the filler tube....has angle bend in fill tube so it will spill when attached to the air brush.sent wrong cup;"
1,Sure to disappoint,"This is a collection of alternate takes and out takes that sound somewhat like the hit versions you loved. In fact, only one song is an original recording (track 15)."
1,Not original!,"Despite what Madacy Special Products claims, I doubt very much these are the orginal artists' original recordings of these hits. I have many of the orginal 45's on these songs and this CD is not a compilation of the orginals---close but not quite. Just listen to ""At the Hop"" or ""The Stroll"" versions, and then listen to your old 45. Even some of the notes sung are not the same as the original recording."
2,Isn't the item in the picture,I was very excited to receive the item nicely wrapped. When I opened the packaging I immediately noticed there were missing items such as the plastic padding... I thought perhaps I didn't need it. When I tried to install the mount it didnt fit where I was lead to believe it would (By the Front sight AR). After much fiddling with the unit I finally realized that this item was indeed another similar item that mounted closer to the flash hider where the barrel diameter shrinks... I was like WTF!!! After getting it on the gun it didn't look too bad so I decided to keep it as I am sure it will cost more to ship it back vs keeping it... Not the item I wanted!!!!
5,Best bass album ever!,This is one of the classic bass albums. Magic Mike was making breakbeat and demonstrating turntablism waaaaaaay before any of these new guys caught on. Check out every one of these songs for some awesome cutting. So far ahead of his time. The cuts are great even for 8 years ago.
4,Overview and philosophy,"If you're expecting a book full of the computer science of AI or A-Life, this isn't it. Steve Grand spends the majority of the book diving into his philosophy and reasoning behind why he developed A-Life in his fashion, and it works quite well.He's a generalist by nature (or at least I'd assume so reading the book) and takes a very holistic view of the science. As such, he does a good job of explaining all the pieces he's putting together, and more importantly why he's putting them together in this fashion.If you're look for conceptual ideas on A-Life or AI, this is a book to get!"
3,"Some good parts, but patchy","There are some interesting analogies and examples of perceived or emergent behaviour but overall many of the arguments do not hold up to scrutiny. If you are looking for a book written in the form of opinions, as opposed to hard facts, then this book will be more to your liking. Certainly something I would borrow from a friend/library rather than paying for it to sit on my shelf - not something I will go back to in future to read again or for reference. It was a disappointment as I was led to it from Richard Dawkins' excellent ""The God Delusion""."
3,Some good some bad.,I liked the line drawings very easy to follow. The book contains some spinal dislocators which I thought were workable. As for the high kicks that he feels that he must put in his books they should be left for the TKD competitors. The have no business in the true pavement area.
2,Not Suggested Reading Material,"I must say, that out of my many years of training in martialarts, I have learned many techniques of killing. This book containsseveral more. I have trained in martial arts most of my life and have learned over 200 ways to kill a man with my bare hands, but, when I opened the cover of this book I was honestly disgusted. When you take this material in to serious concideration it is not a pleasant thought. If you want to learn to defend yourself, then buy the U.S. Marines Close-Quarters Combat Manual, but please, do not buy this book."
1,Not my purchase to review,I didn't buy this and can't review it. I don't know where it came from on my list to review.
3,A great show!,"I loved Till Death and hope that someone brings it back. It's a great show that I looked forward to watching each week, even had the Tivo set for a season pass. If you are a fan of sitcoms like Everybody loves Raymond, seinfeld or Friends you'll probably get a kick out of this show."
2,Everybody loves ... Something Else,"It has some jokes that almost work. Maybe even some that will work for you. But mostly it just seems too comic. Too comic might not seem like a bad thing, but there is too much of the forced setup, lame situations, and the ""comedy"" swallows the situation part of sitcom.They do get fairly/almost racy though, which is nice to see. Too many things are too tame. Doesn't mean the whole is at all shocking, coupling(Uk) this isn't.Perhaps it will suffice if it is already on free (or at least paid for) TV, but why in the world would you buy it."
2,eh...,"They are trying too hard with this show. It is not unique, I feel like it is a clone of Everybody Loves Raymond and a few other family based sitcoms all mashed together into one mediocre show.This one wont find it's self on my tivo season pass anytime soon."
3,Swing is still the thing,"This dvd is rated a buy. Goodman was as always consistently Goodman at his highest performance standard. His attempt at humor though was a bit trite and not spontaneous, as he would have liked the audience to think.Artists are Charlie Anatolini. He is one on the few drummers who is not under the mistaken assumption that the audience has come solely to listen to him. Don Haas is an excellent pianist. Peter Witte on base is also good and his solo (1) melodic.As a guest artist, Sven Agmussen on violin was excellent. Jimmy Maxwell on trumpet could have stayed at home. Although a good section man in a big band, his muted and sporadic playing was barely audable. As for the musical selection, nothing new, but always refreshing to hear these same Goodman standards.For Benny to swing at his age was truly remarkable.The second DVD is an audio of that concert and should rather have contained other material."
4,Goodman in fine form near the end of his career,"I agree with the previous reviews on this one - Goodman seems relaxed and in good spirits, and plays at a very high level for a man nearing the end of his career. The band is very good, also, particularly considering that it is a mix of American and European musicians who were likely put together for this gig and who did not play together regularly. There are two mistakes in the brief liner notes. The guitarist is Harry Pepl, an Austrian musician; his name is misspelled ""Harry Pepe"" in the notes. Second, this was not Goodman's final concert performance ever; it was just his final performance in Denmark. Minor issues aside, this is a very enjoyable performance that I recommend highly."
2,good while it lasted,Have owned this for a little more than a year. At first very happy. So quiet I had to look to see if it was on. But the fan is now dead. Would have paid more for something that just worked 3-4 years.
1,Became noisy after 2 months,I installed this fan with a horizontal orientation on a chipset heatsink. The bearings became noisy after two months of operation with a variable voltage fan controller. Not recommended.
2,included rubberized fan mounts are terrible,"the rubberized fan mounts are completely useless on these fans. I ought two fans, but ended up only using 1. the fan mounts from the first fan essentially disintegrated and the connection to the case within 2 days. Thought it might be the fan, so I replaced the mounted fan with the unused fan and used the mounts from the second fan. those mounts broke apart in the exact same fashion within 3 days. I am now running my computer without the top and fanless while I search for more fan mounts."
2,Sometimes frustrating,"Most of this game is the standard run-jump-and-spin thing, in a Looney-Tunes-esque environment. The gameplay is fairly easy, except for the zookeeper. You have one attack you can use on him: find a booth to change into something else--a skateboarder, for instance--and then mash the button at the right time and at the right distance from him. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. It seems almost random.I put this one aside when I got ""Ty the Tasmanian Tiger"" (a much better platform game) and haven't bothered to pick it up since."
3,Interesting things to know about college football,"This book was interesting. I found it very fun to read. The many things that college football players go through at a big time school were funny. Some were gross. It entertained me though. The story itself was a little sketchy here and there, and jumped forward too fast at certain times I thought. I found that there were gaps in the story that left me wondering if more should have been explained about this or that, but each reader should decide that for themselves. If you have ever wondered what an athlete sometimes has to go through at a college, then this may start to enlighten you a little. It's by no means a tell all tale of sports, just one mans view of the collegiate system, a view that I found fun to read."
2,Not enough depth about playing div. I college football.,"This book provided a good look at what it's like to be involved in big-time division I college football. Unfortunately, this is only one part of the book, and the only good part. There are a number of side stories that have nothing to do with the story, and are quite ridiculous. There is a lot of fluff around what could have been a great book. It's an easy read. I read it quickly because I kept waiting for it to get better. I was very disappointed. If you want to learn about football, buy a book written by Tim Green."
3,"Without the football, it isn't much...","Besides the good look at college football life, this book didn't do much else for me. The love story didn't grab me, and I couldn't keep track of all the different characters. However, once again, it did provide a quality look at what life must be like as a college football player. I'm kind of glad I wasn't one."
3,The Development of Western Music by K. Marie Stolba,"This item's listing is misleading and incomplete. I actually need the text, The Development of Western Music: A History, and this listing stated that it was paperback, and so I thought I would save some money. Actually, what I received was an Anthology, volume 2, Preclassic through the 20th century. Of course, this anthology is to accompany the text, but it does not say that! And what about Anthology Volume 1? It is not clear, in my opinion what one is actually ordering because there is no description of the book. The anthology is very nicely produced, with a glossy cover, over sized, and it lies flat with the spiral binding, but the printing is not that good, sketchy in places, and the notation for some works is tiny and hard to read. No helpful highlighting of main themes either, as in other anthologies I own."
4,Different,This is not a synth album. It is full of guitar and sound almost like New Order mixed with Beatles.
3,some great and some not so great songs,"When Molotov puts together a good song, it's great (or example: Gimme the power, que no te haga bobo jacobo, voto latino, puto). These songs are great musically and lyrically. Unfortunately, while they sing intelligently about the evils of intolerance in Voto Latino, they express blatantly homophobic attitudes in Porqúe no haces más allá. It's a shame that a band with such great potential and such great songs also produces such unenlightened lyrics at times. Still, it's worth it for the good songs."
5,Always on the Mark,"Everytime I open this book, I find the exact words to speak to my heart and soul on the page my fingers find. Without fail.I am taken aback at this precision, and I thank God for the many times that I have found peace meditating on the words of this book.As titled, In Touch with God, truly speaks to a prayerful heart."
5,Comforting in time of tragedy,This is the second time I have ordered this book. The first time was right after my son was in a military accident that almost took his life. While he was in an intensive care burn unit I would read to him. He asked me how I knew what he was thinking because I always had such a perfect answer for his question. I told him it was God speaking to him through someone else who had experienced loss. This book was a great comfort to me and my son during a very difficult time. I lost the first copy in a move and wanted to keep it to read again and share with others who are going through a loss.
4,just ok,"really worn, not do good as I expected, but still acceptable. Damn why I have to write so many words for a damn review?"
4,Beware the shorter edition!,"Great anthology. I love the way it's set up--the table of contents and the index are both quite thorough, and the extra information on the page of each poem itself (e.g. the year) is very helpful. The miniature biographies about the authors at the back are useful and conveniently sized. My only piece of advice would be to make sure you're actually looking for this, the shorter version, and not the full anthology."
2,Change in Erasers Ruins These for Me,"I edit for a living and these pens used to be perfect for working in hardcopy. Unfortunately, the last box I bought contained pens with white erasers that simpy do not work; as another reviewer said, they just smear the ink, leaving nowhere for you to write in the corrections. If you can find a box with the old RED erasers, buy them, but beware: the picture on the box still shows pens with red erasers even though the manufacturer has switched to the useless white ones. Therefore, I'd recommend not buying these online. If you can't ensure you are getting the ones with the red erasers, save your money."
1,"Writes good, doesn't erase","They're fine as red pens, but the erasers don't erase. Instead they smear the red ink around without hardly picking any up, leaving an ugly red blotch. In the case of a newspaper crossword puzzle, it leaves an ugly red (pen ink) and black (news print ink) blotch.The previous generation of Erasermate pens wrote just as well as these but they erased pretty good, so I sadly bought 5 of these things that are useless for crossword puzzles.The four pens will go to our local thrift store, and I hope whoever buys them doesn't pay more then a dime each."
3,Somewhat different recordings,"At first glance, this CD might look like it contains the same tracks as MICHAEL & GEORGE: FEINSTEIN SINGS GERSHWIN. And, indeed, it does. Only one track from MICHAEL & GEORGE is missing (""Swanee"") and only one new track has been added (an instrumental version of ""Summertime"").However, this CD is more different than you'd think. Many, if not most, of the songs on this album contain different instrumental backing tracks. Where piano was used on MICHAEL & GEORGE, here we have synthesizers. The vocals seem the same, but the overall feel of the songs is different. I can't say that it's any improvement on the originals, and I prefer the other versions of the songs better, but they're still great songs.So while this isn't exactly a CD of otherwise-unavailable material, it is definitely a separate item in the Michael Feinstein discography."
4,"Companion to Pluto's ""Curse...""","As opposed to Terry Pluto's book, ""The Curse of Rocky Colavito, which focused more on the colorful personalities behind the Tribe's years of mediocrity, this book focuses on the front office and ownership changes and their effect on the team.I definitely recommend the book as a companion to Pluto's book. But read Pluto first. It's more fun and you'll understand some of the characters in the second book better. And if you can only read one of the two books, read Pluto."
4,Exorcizing some demons,"A book that desperately needed to be written, if only so the true fan can relive the depths of our despair. As Nixon (shudder)once said, ""Only when you've been in the deepest valley..""The Indians had the distinction of being the poorest franchise in the American League for a period roughly between 1968 and 1989. This book is a thorough and well written documentation of that era and how it came to pass. A great deal of blame is laid at the feet of poor trading (often for NO REASON), the cavern that was Municipal Stadium and its adverse affects, and underfinanced or inept ownership (one exception).The end of the book, which is rivalled only by Job in redemptive quality, focuses on the rebuilding of the team and the galvanizing of the local fans.For all true fans, a smile, a tear, and a hard pinch to the nether regions to make certain we are not dreaming. Names have been omitted (by me) to encourage sales as well as protect the innocent."
4,Tribe Misery and Hopefulness,"Torry's ENDLESS SUMMERS is the sad tale of mis-management from the glory days of the 1950s to the depths of the 60s, 70s, and 80s, to the renaissance of the 1990s. He concentrates the heart of the story on the pitiful owners and inept general managers who guided the Tribe for over 40 years. Success was not measured in terms of wins or losses, but simply by whether the team would stay in Cleveland another year.The writing is okay, not great. Like the Tribe itself, the opening of the book (1940s-1950s) and the close of the book (1990s) are the strength. The real hero in the end turns out to be GM Hank Peters, who put John Hart and other top-notch management from the Baltimore Orioles in place.Recommended if you are a Tribe fan, but be warned this is definitely not of the quality of any of Terry Pluto's books."
1,poor design,"Oriole feeders with a narrow neck and bulbous shaped container are impossible to clean. So I looked for an alternative, and this looked like it would work. It was easy to clean, but it lists to one side when hung, and the fluid runs out. The important judgement came from the birds. Before I hung this one there were many orioles using the old one. Not one would use the new one. It hung for 10 days with no use and finally I took it down and rehung the old one. Within minutes the orioles were back. I'm still looking for a good, easy to clean oriole feeder that the birds will use."
1,Too tippy!,Unfortunately this product does not work in a windy area. The feeder blows easily and the sticky food ends up on the ground. I have had more success with the bottle type feeders for orioles.
2,Disappointing product.,I ordered the 16 oz. feeder as our old feeder was several years old and falling apart. The new feeder was a disappointment because it was not properly balanced and tilted/spilled when hung by the provided hook. I don't recommend it to anyone. I did not send it back because the shipping charges would make it even more of a bad buy. I'm sticking with Perky Pet products from now on.
1,Useless,When this oriole feeder is hung with the rod it comes with it will lean to one side causeing the nectar to leak from the center seam making it completely useless.
4,"Good Storyline, Mediocre Acting, Worth Purchasing","Some have said this movie is terrible, that's not the case, and it is not the same old story, at least not told the same old way. The movie kept my attention, but from the start, as someone else stated, there was no chemistry between the actresses from a collective friendship perspective. One on one, the acting was ok, and I really enjoyed how the story was presented. This is not some blockbuster production, with mega dollars, but as an independent film, my hats off to Ms. Dixon for a job well done. I would recommend this movie to others and will definetly rewatch it."
1,Average Low Budget Flick--DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"Not very entertaining or realistic. Superficial predictable storyline with sucky acting. Characters depicted selfish catty woman. Main character a wimpy fish. And the dialogue, aargh! Dont waste your money."
4,Can you handle the truth?,A lot of drama and truths are being told. There were some parts that seemed unreal and kind of silly. For instance: the wedding was unheard of among other things. This movie did touch on real-life drama and that it is why I gave it 4 stars. The drama that each woman had was relate able.
1,Worst,"This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever viewed. This movie had the worst acting, plot, directing, ect. Some direct to DVD Movies are good, this should of been regulated to the trash bin after the last take. Don't waste your hard earned money."
1,Awful in every way,"Bad acting, ridiculous and predictable story line. It is almost cringe worthy. I really am furious I spent money renting this TRASH."
1,"I TOTALLY HATED THIS MOVIE,","This movie from the beginning to the end, was straight garbage and un-realistic period. The bride's so called wedding day, was an absolute/complete & utter joke lol. Even this cast of so called best/college friend's wasn't even believable,they had no friendship chemistry whatsoever. I personally don't/won't recommend this to movie, to anyone I do & or don't know. There are far better and more sensible/likable b-rate movies, available to checkout than this trash. Quite frankly they should've kept this junk/mess of a movie to themselves in my opinion!................"
4,Great Book!!,"I'm not finished reading this book as of yet, but so far the book meets my expectations. The book is very specific on telling the reader how imperative it is to ALWAYS keep our focus on GOD!! By truly following Him and His ways, we can become closer to God in everyway, and by being obedient He will reward us in His own timing.!! God should ALWAYS be our first love!!!.........meaning to put Him first in ALL things everyday!!"
5,Blessed,I was really blessed by this book. I am apart of a Book Club called Sista's Keeper [...]. We read this book and it help me to repent and explained how to stop half steppin and give God your all!
3,Not for DoDAF Wizzards,"I got this book to look for some ideas for practical applications in systems engineering education. Unfortunately, the book is everything but deep and is - if at all - usefull for the undergraduate and minor classes education. What you find here is also available in the free DoDAF specification, and in much more detail. However, if someone wants an easy quick start, a sort of 101 DoDAF or ""DoDAF - Getting started,"" this book may be helpful."
2,"""Jumped the shark""","I knew that I didn't like the show after Delta Burke left. Despite my negative feelings, my mother begged me to get the show for her. I did. She told me to not bother with Season Seven because this Season was horrible. I'm sure that hindsight being 20/20 has something to do with my wondering why on earth the producers let Delta Burke slide through their fingers. I remember at the time there was a lot of controversy about Delta's weight gain, but her character was pivotal to the show. Dixie and Annie should have walked away, too, and let it end on a high note rather than struggle through this frightful season. Jean Smart got it right."
2,"Without Delta & Jean, This Isn't ""Designing Women""","""Designing Women"" thrived due to the chemistry between four amazing actresses: Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, Annie Potts, and Jean Smart. As far as I'm concerned, the show ended at the end of season 5. I give this season two stars simply because Dixie, Annie and Alice (Bernice) appear. Aside from their performances, well, it's just a hot mess. Julia Duffy? Horrors! Love you, Delta & Jean! :)"
5,Finally!,I waited for years for this series to come out and it's just as funny as I remember. Great series.
2,Why Julia Duffy?,"Wow! The exit of Charlene and enter Carlene was an ""okay"" transition, but again why Julia Duffy??? Alice Ghostley should have just been enough as a replacement, but gotta love Jan Hooks. it's an SNL thing."
5,Wonderful sitcom,This ranks right up there as one of my top three favorite sitcoms of all-time. The writers were terrific and the comedy timeless.
5,Designing Women - The Ultimate Entertainment !!,"Designing Women... This show is the best of best-it'll make you laugh, it'll make you awed, it'll even make you cry sometimes...It has beauty, fashion, humor, humanity, love and friendship. And Oh, yes, the most-entertaining southern flabor, too. Set in Atlanta Georgia, all four designing women have such distinct forte in their own right - Julia, the terminator, MaryJo cute as button, Charlene the cotton candy sweetheart, Suzanne Sugabaker, the sassiest and prettiest women to ever hit the TV screen, and Oh, Meshach Taylor!! - a show by himself!I've seldom watched TV shows - to search and buy this series - it is that good! This show is absolutely the tops. Recommend it to people of all ages. You'll watch them over and over... :)"
3,Pretty unique bag.,"I purchased this for my daughter's Christmas present. Actually, she picked it out. I didn't care for the metal handle, but my daughter loved the bag. Only uses it for occasional use."
4,Great PPV,"I enjoyed the matches of DX vs. Legacy and the ""I Quit"" match between John Cena and Randy Orton. Most Pay Per Views dissapoint outside of Wrestlemania but not this one."
3,Don't break me,"The Christian-William Regal rematch was much better then their SummerSlam bout.The Legacy-DX Submissions count anywhere match was not as good as their SS match but still a good match.The Kane-Great Khali Singapore rematch was a little better the their SS bout but still not great.The John Cena-Randy Orton ""I Quit"" rematch was also much better then their SS bout.The CM Punk-UnderTaker match was and still is ...THE MOST POO SMACKING,GARGABE EATING,DISGUSTING PIECE OF WRESTLING JUNK I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.The rest are o.k. I give this PPV a 4 out of 10."
3,Wrestling DVD,Wasn't the greatest wrestling DVD but definitely not the worst. Would watch this again so it wasn't a waste of money.
3,There are better products.,This was my first dive into wireless. I was very disappointed and immediately thought wireless still wasn't ready for primetime. My whole idea was that I wanted 802.11a so that I didn't get any interference from my cordless phones or my neighbors who are close. DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH 802.11a. Real world distance capabilities in my house were much less than 802.11g on this unit. I used it with a Dlink DWL-AG650 card.Anyway. A friend at work let me borrow a Netgear WGR614 and it is working much better in my house than this Dlink unit. Zero dead spots using the Netgear on 802.11g with the same DWL-AG650 card. I also haven't experienced any problems in relation to cordless phone interference. The Netgear has better security features anyway.The Netgear WG511 card had the same performance as the DWL-AG650 card.Bottom line. There are better units out there.
2,Readme.1st,"this is a 2 star or less router which will take you a week of screwing around if you havn't read my review. out of the box the DHCP Server within the router will re-lease lan ip's every 9min, 24/7, constantly restarting the lan, which somehow causes all kinds of seemingly unrelated problems throughout your lan if you don't follow these simple steps. when you get the router home, plug it into the wall, cable modem and computer. turn everything on and wait for things to settle down. log onto the web base interface by pointing your web browser to your new router's lan IP of http://192.168.0.1/ (BTW, 192.168.0.1 is not a public IP . . . it's contained within your local network), admin, no password. click the tools tab and firmware button and download the firmware to your desktop.

4,Note to split tank riders: Only one cap. Right side,Don't let the wording of this add or the picture fool you. Read all the way through to the description. This is a single gas cap that fits the right tank only of a two tank bike. If you have split tanks you will need to contact the Landmark factory for a left tank cap. The salesperson at Landmark informed me that all their part numbers that end in A like LM104-1A and LM104-2A are single caps that fit the right side only. The left cap sells for $49 plus $10 shipping. I hope this helps somebody. Keep the shiny side up.
2,lLa Cucina,I enjoyed the photos but the recipes themselves I found to be too lengthy and most times had too many ingredients which usually contained at least one or two that were expensive or difficult to come by. I never cooked any of the recipes and felt that they were far from your average fare. Sorry La Cucina.
1,Lived for only two weeks.,"Clunky and slow yet sounds great. Oops, died after two weeks and would not give back the CD inside."
1,I agree with the last review - this is junk!,"I too bought this in Dec 04 and it is now July 06 and the player is DEAD. It never worked well from the start. Annoying remote/on screen operation, poor CD/DVD load-in tray and simply a cheaply made product."
1,Piece of junk,"Slow clunky noisy overpriced and broke within one year (and can't get the disk back) Yamaha will not honor warentee . DESPITE THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT IT NEW, read the fine print very carefully. WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER YAMAHA PRODUCT EVER"
2,Sounds better than it looks,"Has excellent audio performance, but has a problem reading one of my dvd audio disks. No usable fluorescent front- panel display to think of. The remote lacks separate ff and chapter forward buttons, making the interface very frustrating at times. Why couldn't they include this minimal expense item?This unit has an inexcusably noisy transport, and takes forever to start playing a disk.It cost me over 30 dollars in shipping to get the unit serviced after it froze up. It still would not play the problem dvd audio disk I have."
1,"bought two, both busted","I purchased one new, which died at 18 months, outside of warrenty. Repair would be 79 plus shipping. So I bought a refurb for 69, which included shipping. It lasted two months. Won't buy another...."
3,With dvd's today this title needs more,"Getting all her videos together is worth getting the dvd alone, but the fact it's missing 5.1 sound or any digital sound is quit disapointing. And with dvd's today I expect more. Some special features would have been nice, like a Shania commentary would have been fantastic. An interview or making of, or anything?But the dvd is worth getting. Her video's are great. You gotta love ""Man! I feel like a woman"""
1,bad/ nonworking,Cd would not play love shania twain too bad it did not function she is a great arttidt. Manufacturing problem
3,Platinum it's not,Struck me as a quick effort to cash in with little concern about the quality of the material. I feel Shainia would agree but probably didn't have any say in its release.
3,Where's the paperwork,"I just got this DVD and I know I'm going to love it because I love everything Shania does. Still, I was disappointed that it is basically just the case and the DVD disk. No reading material or booklet to go along with it. I agree with others that it would have been nice to have some extra features. I realize that this is simply a quick compilation to provide us Shania fans with something new while we await her new stuff. All that said, I'm sure this will be great."
5,A MUST have for Shania fans,This is a wonderful collection of various Shania videos. I really enjoyed kicking my shoes off and watching reminiscing when I first heard each song. I highly recommend this DVD.
1,smells horrible,"i bought this perfume in hoping that it'll smell like the lip gloss but no... it doesn't. too musky. not flowery enough. if you're like me, someone that likes flowery, flirty, sweet scent then this is NOT FOR YOU."
5,I just discovered a new favorite author,"Phil Tomasso's Adverse Impact leads you into the frightened mind and life of a stalking victim. The reader feels the terror that occurs when everyone you care about, work with and come across could be your stalker. Every time you start to relax and firmly believe 'I got this figured out' an event takes place and the doubts begin. Do not start this book before bed, every sound will have you hiding under your blankets and wondering ""Is that....?"" Chris Freeburn, author of Parental Source and Generation Without Souls"
1,Not impressed,"Tomasso tries to get inside the head of a female protagonist. Noble goal, but it doesn't ring true to me. I just can't sympathize with Linda nor empathize with the author."
2,BEWARE,"Don't let the nice new cover art fool you, these SOUL CINEMA DOUBLE-FEATURES are nothing but the old non-anamorphic 2001 MGM dvds placed in a 2-cd case with the new front-cover art literally GLUED on top of the case. They didn't even bother to slip it under the clear plastic sleeve. I've bought hundreds of dvds over the years, but I've never seen packaging quite this lazy. The movies are still entertaining, but this reissue is very disappointing."
1,Bad Product,"The Pad stops working 3 weeks after i bought it. I didnt have time to return the prodcut cause i was coming back to my country. The seller was OK, but this is a very bad quality product, thats why the 1 star."
2,"Loud, but cheap","Although the box the cooler came in touts ""extra quiet"", it's anything but. It's very loud, but for the price, it's fine."
2,CHEAP-O!,"Serioulsy Dissapointed. Used it two days and now sit atop my bookshelf.The concept for this item is so simple and inexpensive, there no reason to use such low quality matierial. It feels very cheap, and the way it was put together was also poor. I had to finish snapping it into place! I recommend you pay $10 more for the better one."
1,Not worth it,This is by far the most poorly constructed cooling pad I have seen. Unfortunately it'snot even worth the time and money to ship it back for a refund so it just ended up in the trash. What a waste to think that I had purchased this as a Christmas present for someone.
2,"Could you speak up, my laptop cooler is too loud!",This laptop had been reviewed at 5 stars by one person so I decided to buy. If I'd remembered my statistics I would have known that the polling error of a sample of one is about +/- 5 stars. The plastic seems pretty sturdy but my laptop didn't sit on top of it very stably. The hub seems to work. My biggest complaint is the noise. I usually don't mind white noise and even use it to go to sleep - but this wasn't background noise. It whined so loud that it gave me a headache. I used it for about 30 minutes and had to stop. I'd avoid this cooler unless you already work around jet engines.
1,cooler but does it work?,"No it breaks too fast, The fan blades hit the housing so the blades break off one by one, where's the quality?"
2,Not the best on the market.,"This Laptop Chill Pad I don't think is the best on the market. Next time I buy a Laptop cooler I will spend a little more money and get a better product. This unit is completely made of plastic, the case, fan blades everything...2 weeks after I opened the box I set the cooler and lap top on a desk and did not notice a pencil under everything and broke a blade off of one of the fans. I needed to cut off a second blade opposite the first to balance to fan wheel. If the unit was made better it should have been able to handle the pencil stopping the fan blade and not brake a blade off.Keith"
1,didn't work so I trashed it,3 of the 4 ports did not work. It was cheap so guess I got what I paid for. Wasn't worth the hassle of returning it so I just trashed it.
1,you dont get what you pay for,"i bought this and i didnt mind the noise and it did keep puter cool it worked for like a week, right from the beginning i started to get surges from usb and then eventually the pieces came out completely. so if you get it dont use the usb ports, they come out real easy"
1,Refuse,"I opened the box, I pluged it in, happy for 12 minutes, set my notebook down and fan blades broke off and pieces went into my laptop. SPECTACULAR!!!!"
4,not bad for it's price.,"like someone below me mentioned, the cooler is suppose to ""suck"" the air away not ""blow"" it into the laptop. it does the job, it does cool my laptop down. also, the built in usb hub is a nice extra. it's also neat that you can power the chill pad via ac and via usb, just remember that to use the additional usb ports on the cooling pad, the cooling pad must be connected to the laptop via usb.the fans could be quieter. i don't think they're earsplitting loud, but they're not ""whisper quiet."" it's great for the price. if you're looking for a decent notebook cooling pad that gets the job done for a low price, i would highly suggest this. however, if you have a huge issue with noise, you may consider looking at a different cooler. personally, the sound that the fans make aren't an issue for me."
1,Bad Choice,I got this item and when I first plugged it in within 30 seconds a fin on one of the fans broke off and within 10 minutes another. I contacted custome service and it took more than a week to hear back. I am returning this for a refund. Quite unhappy!
2,Cool Pad Comments,This cooler has an external 5 volt plug and I wrote to Eforcity asking where I could obtain the 5 volt power supply. All I received was an NON-ANSWER telling me thanks. I doubt very seriously that I will buy from Eforcity again.
3,Notebook cooling fan,"This notebook cooling fan seems to be working OK. I have not had any heat problems with it on. The only shortcoming was that there was no set of instructions for the user. Being new to such fans, I had it in upside down, until someone noticed it and told me. That would be good to tell the users in the instruction sheet."
1,This sucks!!!!,"The most unusable fan I have ever seen.The USB is only 1.1. Don't be fooled by the ads.First, you can easily be confused which side is up...The fooling fan sucks, but never sucks any hot air below my laptop!My laptop stands there and is really really HOT!"
3,Good but...,"I purchased this product because my Gateway kept locking up and I couldn't figure out why. A friend ask me if I had a cooler. I didn't know about them so he explained that because the laptop sits directly on a table, desk, etc. Or at worst in the bed smothered by a pillow or blanket, it could not breathe the way a regular hard drive does. I like this product because it is inexpensive and helps the laptop even if not running. (I turn the concave side up and air circulates better.) The first unit I received was broken. I contacted Eforcity and they immediately sent another. Love the extra ports and on/off switch. Yes, it is cheaply made but right along through here 'I' cannot afford $40 to cool my laptop when less than $20 will do the same thing. Economy folks."
1,Go Video quality is poor ...,I purchased last years same model and the VCR quality is noticably poorer then my 3 yr old SONY VCR. also the VCR recording can not record weaker signal stations. My sony would record it but the govideo unit would just end up with garbage.
2,The product name can be decieving,"The Silencer itself is fine, appears to be made of aluminum, the quality is reasonable. It does, however, come with the tip painted orange which is not shown in the picture. The threading on the silencer w/o the adapters is 14mm+, so it will work great if that is the threading on your airsoft gun.The real problem is the ""4 Threaded Adaptor Heads."" One might think that these would convert to other common threadings like 14mm- or the 16mm used on some pistols. They do not. They are only threaded on the side that screws into the silencer, the other end has no threads at all, just various sizes of short friction? fitting. frankly with the weight of the silencer, even if these were a perfect fit on the end of the barrel, it would fall of at the slightest bump.If you have a 14mm+ threaded barrel and don't mind the orange tip then this would be a decent deal, otherwise the functionality is quite limited."
3,decent,"SHAOLIN IN KUNG FU MYSTAGOGUE tells the story of the struggle which took place during the Ching Dynasty.KUNG FU OF EIGHT DRUNKARDS is a martial arts technique which gives the appearance of being drunk.JACKIE CHAN: THE INVINCIBLE FIGHTER is a documentary covering Jackie Chan's rise in the Hong Kong film industry. Included are some of Jackie Chan's greatest moves and stunts, from ten of his classic Hong Kong films and more.Gave it 3 stars for Mystagogue. Eight drunkards is good if you like the wu-tang clan fu films, and the jacky chan one is just a collection of scenes from other movies."
4,Product as advertised,"Product received as advertised, works with the Colt AR-15 9mm handle as advertised. Good value for the price."
4,Good little rail,"I was looking for a weaver rail to go with my new Firefield scope and for the price I could not pass this one up. It is a good little rail. As posted by others you might want to throw a little lock tight on but otherwise it is good. The only other improvement I could think of is perhaps if the very front and rear of this mount were more rounded. The edges are a bit sharp, not enough to cut but if you bump yourself with it, you will probably take some flesh off. Not a lot but enough to notice, lol. Over all a good longer mount."
4,Good rail mount,My old rail mount set screw literally snapped in half. The damn thing would wiggle out all the time. The screw on this mounts is much beefier and stays in place. The length is perfect for the handle on the AR-15. The finish is anodized black and has remained unscratched through many uses.
3,AR-15 Scope Mount Weaver Rail,"First of all, the rail I received was not the same rail I purchased, but the rail I received worked with adjustments from me. The bolt used to secure the rail to the gun had to be ground down 1/8"" so I could continue to use my iron sights. The rail was holding a Sightmark Ulta Shot Reflex Sight and a Sightmark 5X Magnifier. The rail eventually would not stay tight and I had to use LocTite (red thread locker) to secure it to the gun. After 100 rounds and carrying of the gun....the rail has not moved."
5,"good product, great price","Easily mounts to M4 carry handle with supplied finger/thumb screw. however screw needs to tightend carefully with pliers to prevent loosening during shooting. I mounted a red dot and stayed zeroed in. I have since mounted a 4x optical. If I have any subsequent loosening issues, I'll secure it with Locktite. You can still use iron sights, with optical mounted because of the low profile of this mount rail."
1,missed the target,"The rail is simple enough, but mine was too narrow - when the mount was locked all the way down it still was loose on the rail."
3,Not enough information,"I love the adapter. I can still use my fixed sights. However, it doesn't fit standard scope sight mounts. I have to purchase Weaver mounts. They are not expensive, but I wish I had known that when I bought it. Please include more information."
3,fits the rifle,The rail fit my AR but no room to adjust - the scope needs to come down more but no way to do so. Might have to jerry rig the rail so it sits higher in the back... would be nicer if the rail was somewhat adjustable... all in all - pleased with the rail
3,ok,did what it was advertised for but it limited the field of view when looking through it. i tried it out some but wound up taking it off later on.
5,Weaver See Through Rail,My AR has an upper with a carry handle and I had ordered several different Weaver rails but they all blocked my peep site. This rail allows me to mount any optics and still see my iron sights. Easy to install.
5,carry handle scope mount,"the service was great, product was just as in the picture. it was a great buy, had no trouble mounting my scope. stayed tight after three hundred rounds fired. no complaints will buy and will recommend to my friends. thanks for the fast service."
2,Did not like or want this.,This was sent to me in error. I had ordered a different mount and this one was sent to me by mistake. I did not like this mount because it was heavy and had an open channel on the top side to collect dirt and debris. Would not recommend.
3,Disappointed,"The reason I am disappointed is because if you install this correctly on your carrying handle you lose the ability to flip your iron sight from Long/Short. It has to stay on Long range because it wont fit if its on short range. If you flip the rail around and mount it the other way, you gain the ability to use your short range iron sight again, but now the rail hangs over the front of the handle 3/4s of an inch or so :( so its a lose-lose situation. The rail is of good quality tho. I am using the Bushmaster M4A3 Carbine with the carrying handle that comes with it"
5,ar-15 scope mount,"The mount was bought for a friend as a gift/wish list filler.He was very pleased with the item.Amazon found the best price that i could find with a single search,so now i rely on Amazon for most of my cyber shopping needs."
3,cheap but it works,"the bolt is too long so it sticks up into the channel blocking the iron sights. i used a washer and lock washer to space it correctly. it has a little left/right play inside the channel of the carry handle, so when you tighten it down all the way it wants to cant left a little bit; i jammed a pencil in there to keep it centered while i torqued it down so its straight in line with the barrel. after doing these things it works great, and you cant beat the price."
3,Screw comes loose,"The weaver rail works, but picatinny mounts don't line up very well and the single thumb screw loosens easily just from rifle recoil. You can use this rail and still use the iron sights, which is nice to co witness with your scope."
2,Mediocre Industrial Music,I was big into Ministry and Skinny Puppy back in high school but Schnitt Acht just didn't cut for me. The music is so-so and I must say that the CD never found itself in my rotation all that much.
5,Enjoyable and Entertaining.,"I love Star Trek: The Next Generation, it is one of my all-time favorite TV shows and I l know that there are fans who didn't like this episoode and thought it was too silly and campy but I liked the episode The Royale and found it very entertaining and enjoyable! The scenes in that Casino with Data and the gambler from Texas were funny!"
2,not what im looking for,"Damn... I really need to read all the reviews. I ordered thiscd assuming that since it got a 4 star rating, it must be pretty good,right? Well I'm not saying it's horrible but it's not what I like. Ilike to hear some good, hard, thumping trance. The stuff I like isonly present for the last three tracks of the first CD and most of thesecond half of the second CD. This album isn't lame, dance musicthough.It's structured with funk in mind so I can kinda groove toit. Somewhat. Hey, it's better than fruity dance tracks but, my nomeans, is it my favorite stuff. Why can't I find some good trance?This CD is kinda fun, I guess assuming that you are very hyper anddriving about 90 mph down the freeway with the top down on yourconvertable. However, if you are like me and you don't own aconvertable & you don't get out much (shup up!) this CD is prettyboring. This and the MoS clubers guide to Ibiza 2000 make me NOT wantto go to Ibiza. Send me some trance, for the love of all that issacred!"
4,It was a very intense movie.,Not sure I would have watched it if it hadn't been recommended by a workshop leader. The movie content is very sobering.
5,Great movie!,This great movie about Rwanda presents a clear chronicle of what happened in the opening days of genocide.
1,"This version is ""Edited for Content"" ""Clean""","I saw the unedited version, which was excellent even if it was ""dirty."" I would recommend that version instead of any edited one.Beyond the Gates (Clean)"
3,Doesn't Rock too Hard!,I don't think the Sound Quality is what it should be? I was Expecting More? I would'nt buy it again.
1,Poor quality video,"If you enjoy watching music videos do yourself a favor and don't watch this one. Cheap video effects surround your favorite artists resulting in frustration. You will find yourself asking ""why?"""
2,DON'T BE MISSLED BY MY COMMENTS,"I did not particularly like this and if I had seen it beforehand,I would not have purchases it. Having said that, this is purelya personal preference product and it may be right up your alley.I was never into the phyco-delic. Actually had to turn away forsome of the ""special effects"". Did not watch the last couple of songs.My husband, on the other hand, was almost giddy. Well, maybe not thatbad. But he liked it.It depends on what you are in to.If I had seen it before I purchased it, I would have passed on it.But I repeat myself.;-)Linda B.Alabama"
1,Vixens of Wrestling=NOTHING like WWE Divas Undressed,"I should've listened to the warning of the guy who said this dvd was a waste of my time. I was hoping this dvd was like one of the WWE divas dvds with footage of the girls in bikinis/lingerie, but didn't happen. This dvd featured 8 girls, but only 4 of them were hot and the others were ugly with 1 of them looking like Luna Vachann but uglier and another one being an uglier version of Chyna. There's maybe 2 girls that you actually see in bikinis, but it's nothing much. I recommend all the WWE Divas dvds and XPW's Lizzy Borden: Xposed(yep, she's naked). At least these dvds have the sexy women looking sexy and you get to see some wrestling matches"
3,Just alright,"Not the greatest (and no real names involved); think I was supposed to order a different one (with the good names of wrestling). All in all, just alright."
4,"Ant Farm Durable, Educational but lasts 3 months","This is a great toy and almost idiot proof. The form for ants allows you to receive appropriate ants within about 3 weeks so you do not mess THAT up. The ants dig wonderful tunnels throughout the space and it is amazing to watch them. They cannot escape and it is easy to provide new air when needed.However -- the ants die off after 2-4 months (is natural, says company) or so and the farm is not reusable, as far as I can see.Kind of pricy for the toy's lifespan, but at least the critters stay inside the farm."
5,I love Texas,By far the best movie for exhibitionist lovers. Plenty of hot girls bareing it all. Mostly flashing but just a wonderful dvd for the collection.
2,dont bother,"i got this cd 6 years ago and i didnt listen to it even 3 times the production is amateur it sounds like a long pathetic demo.the music is also popish trash.there is so much other good music to check out ,i cant understand why would anybody want to buy this one."
5,MY MOM LOVES THIS CREAM,"Mom has diabetes along with edema in her ankles and neuropathy on the bottom of her feet. I massage moms ankle area and especially the bottom of her feet and she simply loves it. While half way into the first tube that I purchased, I decided to buy three more tubes. Every single night, I rub this on the ankle/feet area and it totally relaxes her and the massage really gets the circulation moving.It does relieve some pain so that it is bearable for mom.As long as mom enjoys this, I will always continue to buy it for her. If she is happy, than so am I."
4,"Great set, wish this Jasmine could change outfits","My daughter was super excited to get her Jasmine for Christmas, especially with the included characters. The only complaint I have is that she is not able to change outfits like the other small princess characters my girls have. If that's not a requirement, this set is awesome."
5,Love Sucks,"Feel the love in this all-new 6teen DVD. This has the following three episodes:""Stupid Over Cupid"" - Jonesy attempts to sell himself on the streets by being an eligible date up for bidding. Then things get a little out of hand. Meanwhile, Wyatt tries to make the perfect date for him and Serena, but his plans don't go as planned either.""Cecil B. Delusioned"" - Jonesy tries out his new video camera by staging a prank on Nikki.""The One With the Text Message"" - Wyatt is shocked that Serena broke up with him on a text message; therefore, he has to find out why. Also, Jen and Caitlin fight over a dress.Surely these episodes may also be on the ""Season 1, Volume 2"" DVD set, whenever that will come out. But still, you'd be surprised how teenage love comes and goes."
1,Just Does Not Work,"I have had a lot of experience with Polder products in the past and it was all good, but not this time. This digital thermometer takes forever to get a reading and reads about 30 degrees lower than the actual temperature. It is useless to me, but since I did not use it much, by the time I was frustrated with it the return window had expired."
3,Poorly packed,"Package was slight crushed, must have been before shipping, because shipping box was fine. Crushed the lubricate oil bottle, so it was a bit of a mess in there. Worked ok, but you get what you pay for."
3,Soft and gentle lesbian erotica,"Lindsay Welsh has come up with a very gentle, very victorian and oh-so-soft story of lesbian love on the road. Her heroine meets a variety of partners and enjoys the pleasures of Sappho in a modest and conservative language where hardly no f- c- or p- words are allowed.This book is different from Welshes other books in that it only vaugly tuches into D/S themes, which are central in most of her other work.I - with a preferance for the D/S side of lesbian erotica - found this book a little too soft and boring, but I think others might find this a very beautiful, though fairly urealistic story.Anyway, Welsh is my heroine!"
2,Major disappointment,Elaine's travels are a weak framework for her to jump in and out of one sexual liaison after another. I expected more.
1,Absolute Trash!,"Do not waste your money on this one!I've seen hundreds of Kung Fu movies from the seventies to the present and these are three of worst! The story line, the acting (which are, I know, as a rule not that great anyway), the cinematography and especially the action are all pitifull at best. As for the humor segments, what's with the grown men pee-ing their pants? For that matter, does anyone find people with diahrea all that amusing? Carter Wong has been in ONE good movie (Big trouble in little China)but what was John liu ( usually a great action star) doing in this puke-fest? I only give this one star because I have to....HORRIBLE!"
2,The essentials,"Unfortunatly, an opportunity to provide a guide for mastery is wasted. Instead, we simply get a ""by the numbers"" guide to finishing Sonic Heroes."
2,I own the game,"Since I own the game, I am forced to say that the book is not a must-buy. The game is very easy and the only thing you'd possibly read is just the chaotix team section and how to find some keys. In my situation, I'd only buy it to find out an easy way to get all the chaos emeralds since I've already ""beaten"" the game (not quite, though, since I need the emeralds) I give it two stars because-although it might be complete and stuff-it is not necessary."
1,The Same Old Song,"If you've been alive and semi-conscious for any part of the past thirty or forty years, you already know everything included in this book: The medical industry is inefficient (and potentially dangerous), our healtcare system doesn't provide proper holistic care, it's necessary to make sure your spine is properly aligned (Weinberg is a chiropractor), the condition of your body is a direct result of what you think, and you should eat right, exercise, and keep a positive attitude.That's it. That's the book in one paragraph."
4,really good book,Not as good as the self healing human in my opinion. However it has lots of good concepts. I do not completely agree with everything Weinberg states in this book. Still it is really worth reading.
4,Excellent helpul information,"Although written some time ago, this book contains lots of helpful practical steps for anyone thinking about there long term health, but it is particularly valuable for anyone facing a current health worries or diagnosis. It encourages you, through practical steps to take ownership of your health and healing processes and to move way from the helpless 'victim' mentality, that the mainstream medical system seems to foster. It has been, and continues to be immensly helpful to me."
1,Not so great...,"I read the two reviews on this timer and thought to myself "" How complicated can it be?"" and bought it. It arrived quickly but when I pulled it out of the box the 0 to 60 minutes label was skewed on the dial and when I tried it to hear what the ringer sounded like: no ringer. It just ticks and stops. I'm sorry I was so lazy and didn't go to the store to buy a timer cause now I've wasted my time anyway."
1,Ticks loudly,"This timer is what the other reviews indicate. However, they didn't say that the thing ticks so loudly that you can't stand to wear it around your neck or hardly have it in the same room. I would have to hide it under a pillow or something. Has not been useful for me."
3,Good but loud,"The tick was a little loud and the strap could have been a bit longer, but it works just fine."
3,Timer on a rope,"I gave this product 3 stars only because it is always five or 6 seconds off the alotted time. It is very handy for working outdoors to remind you to move the water hose, etc. I do think it is worth buying!"
4,good,"So far, it works fine. No problems with it. It's convenient when you have something on the stove and go outside or are working around the house and forget the time. No more burned-on food!"
1,poor product,"had this timer sent to my elderly mother, well it broke after about a week and a half. to small of an investment to have her send back to me to send back to amazon for a refund. oh well, too bad it broke."
5,"It's a pleasure, Mr. Capra!",Splendid collection of Frank Capra's classics. The quality of the Dvd's is fair enought. It's a pity that in the subject of subtitles the spanish is forgotten.
5,Perfect!,"This was exactly what I expected it to be. My husband LOVED it for his birthday present. It had all the Capra Movies you could want, with the exception of Meet John Doe. And the price is right!"
5,"A Great Collection of Films, Respectfully Done","It Happened One NIght, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington are some of the greatest movies ever made. They are personal favorites of mine and I watch them regularly. Clark Gable never shined so brightly in a movie and Gary Cooper had a light side that glows in his Capra films. They are having fun and it is contagious! Jimmy Stewart is able to be a nice guy who has some tough choices to make in his movies. You Can't Take It With You is a fun film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1937. It is a madcap romp about a fun wheeling family whose daughter is marrying into a moneyed family. What is right? Having fun all the time or working all the time, what is the balance? American Madness is a good film and very interesting in Capra's repertoire. The documentaries are very interesting and I came to enjoy the commentaries by Frank Capra Jr. for all the films. A necessary collection for film buffs."
3,The Premier Frank Capra Collection,"I bought this set months ago and did not open until this week. ""You Can't Take It With You"" is defective. It will not play more than three quarters through the movie. You can not get past this point. The other movies are fine."
1,Incredibly frustrating!,My 8 yo daughter got this as a present and its impossible to use. Tears all around. Ugh.
4,Works perfectly,"This memory works perfectly for me, in my trusty old Compaq Armada E500 - just install it, and off you go. I highly recommend using PNY's configurator to tell you which memory to order for your system: http://www.pny.com/configuratorI've never had to run utilities to install or check memory as other reviewers mentioned. The most important thing is to follow the manufacturer's directions, such as ordering the right memory, being sure to ground yourself before handling the memory, etc.I now have one Kingston 256MB module and one PNY 256MB module in this laptop, and they work fine together.Why four stars? Well, I always feel these things could be cheaper (though Amazon's price is fairly competitive). 4.5 stars then!"
5,Best price and works like a charm,I'm not sure what everyone else is complaining about but my memory works exactly as it should be. I bought two 265MB chips and my computer is running like the day I bought it....7 years ago! It's as if I bought a new computer with the new memory upgrade. You cant beat the price. I'm happy.
4,Satellite user,Good upgrade to my Satellite notebook. Worked after a small upgrade on the Windows XP.
1,I got it! But it don't work!,After using Microsoft's free download utility program (look for mtinst.exe) I found that this memory failed 14 out of 16 of the standard memory tests -- it's got to go back!
5,satisfied customer,I ordered two...one came defective..they replaced it immediately. I don't know what else I need to say except that the product worked as I expected it to.
1,A Gay Basher when it got him votes,"Bauman did NOT come out of the closet, he was exposed. HE disgusted most of Maryland not because he was gay, but because he was one of the fiercest gay bashers in Washington and few are reviled more than hypocrites like Bauman. If he was having trouble coming to terms with his sexual orientation he had no trouble deciding it was ok to pull the wool over his constituents eyes. What conscience?"
1,uninspirational!,"This is one of the first books I ever read about a gay person. Instead of being inspiring like other books, this did not make me feel good when I was a closeted teen. Yes, I think this book may help the closeted and some gays and lesbians struggling with alcoholism. Still, I never got the sense that he decided to support gay rights. He may have outed Barney Frank in this book, solely for partisan reasons. He says things that I thought were racist against blacks. I doubt gays of any political stripe would be moved by this book. This was definitely not the material of a gay hero or worthy pioneer."
3,Short life of the ON button,"I've had 2 phillips universal remotes, 6 and 8 devices (this one). In both cases the ON button stopped working after one year or so. The good thing is it has almost all the right buttons and there's no need to re-program. I agree with the issue that it is SLOW, specially for the learned buttons. Not bad but this time I will replace it with a different brand."
4,8 years... WOW!!!,"I bought this remote about 8 years ago. It has worked for everything! Magnavox receiver, Kenwood amp, Replay DVR, Sanyo television, Daewoo television, and others. It didn't have a code for my Digix DVD player, but the programming modes were easy to use and versitile, and I was able to program it for that as well... no problem. The lack of a ""punch through"" feature for audio is a negative, but definitely not something I'd complain about. It's easy enough to hit ""audio,"" change volume or settings, then go back to my main device. Also, there IS punch through for television audio to the DVR mode. In recent weeks, the ""on"" button finally wore out, but given how old it is, that's not something to complain about either. I liked it enough that I'm getting a new one identical to the old!"
2,Some drawbacks but ok for normal use,"Bought this remote and what wasn't found in the listed codes was easily programmed in ""Learn"" mode. Buttons are small but as with anything else, you adapt to it. One handy feature is the 3 ""Macro"" buttons you can program function sequences for ""1 button"" control of multiple devices. I purchased 2 of these $29.99 remotes at Christmas Tree Shops for $4.99. They had a bin full of them in the original human-proof packaging..."
1,It was a flop . . .,"I got this remote in May. It was great, it replaced 5 remotes in my bedroom, so that reduced a lot of clutter. It took a while to set up, but once I got all of the codes figured out it worked well.Until now. The darn thing died. Just seized up. New batteries don't help. At $13 a month (I expedited shipping), I'd have to say it it was a pretty lousy value.The worst part . . . it was over 30 days so Amazon won't replace it. It's not even heavy enough to use as a doorstop.Don't get pulled in by the new low price . . . it's not worth it."
4,Most versatile at lowest price,"My home theatre collection is eccletic at best. Toshiba 32"" TV;TiVo Series 2 stand alone unit;Dish Network 301 Receiver;RCA Surround sound; Phillips DVD;Samsung SIR-T351 HDTV Receiver. Needless to say I had a table top full of remotes. I found this remote at Best Buy and was surprised to see that it claimed to control everything that I had. Well, IT DOES. My wife likes it (most important).Only drawbacks are very tiny button labeling on the unit (you have to be under 40 to read it), and having to switch modes when going between channel change and volume change.I am also disappointed that I could have bought it much cheaper over the web, but..."
4,Remotey,It is a good remote. It puts up with the beating my little brother gives it. Though he eventually wears it out. And it is easy for him to work with a simple setup without a ton of tiny little buttons that do everything.
3,Good value,"Pros- Learning function works very well.- It has all the buttons I need to control my dvr.- You can't beat the price.Cons- Button layout isn't that great. I got this because I wanted to control a dvr. Unfortunately, most of the dvr buttons are at the bottom of the remote, and are not easy to reach.- The button response is very slow. I would have given this remote 4 or 5 stars if the response time was as fast as the dvr remote from my cable company.I probably wouldn't buy it again because of the response time, but for the price I had to give it a try."
3,Versatile but still not perfect,"Was able to program for most of my items and the learn feature works well. The response time from button push seems better than my last remote. The biggest weakness and what irritates me is that this is a ""Phillips"" programmable remote and there is no code for my ""Phillips"" DVR. I had to use the learn feature for all of the buttons."
4,Can be programmed for Receiver Volume!,"Nice remote, no backlight - but for $15 its a deal.As some have noted, the volume controls in TV mode cannot be programmed for your receiver/preamp.HOWEVER, the Level+ and Level- buttons (the 4 arrow buttons at the bottom of the remote) can be programmed to control volume for just about any receiver using the learning function (while still in TV mode!).I have a Toshiba TV and have the Level+ & Level- buttons programmed to control the volume on my cambridge audio receiver - I am using another remote with the Rotel Preamp on my other system.In summary, works great for what I need it for with the very minor inconvenience of having to using the lower buttons for volume control (hence 4 stars)."
1,Junk -- No Reciever Audio Punch Thru,"Great remote, except for one thing... You can't set the Volume+/- buttons to control the reciever. It is only set up to control the TV!Don't believe the other review that says you can... Call Phillips at 919-573-7854 if you don't believe me!Unbelievable they would leave out this feature. Other than that, it controls everything I have (RCA TV, Yamaha receiver, JVC 7-disc DVD, Symphonic VHS, Technics 100 CD, VOOM HD Sat, Zenith HD OTA, and Channel Master antenna rotor)!This junk is going back tomorrow!"
4,Alright,It's fun for awhile but i couldn't get past the potted ghost in the second world I would have given it 3 stars overall if it weren't for the minigames which by the way there's a cheat go too a world and the stage select but don't press A Hold select then press L trigger L trigger B button A button r trigger this cheat opens up a screen where you have the option too play all 6 different mini games
4,Love it,"This game is the funnest GBA game I have ever played! My friend has it he is on 3rd world,but it's still the best! Please get it!"
4,Great!,"This game is sssssssoooooooooo cool,but when you get past world1 it's hard! Yoshi is sooo cute!"
3,"Cute enough, but I just can't get into it","Super Mario World 2: Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island. Phew! How about that for a title. I admit I found it a bit confusing putting these Mario Advance games in order but I think I've figured it out now. You gotta admit it's a bit convoluted.This game is a simple 2D platformer like most of the retro Mario games only it has four more levels than the SNES version released in 1995. It's got easy-going gameplay in the typical Super Mario style, gorgeous graphics, generic sounds and not much to keep me interested. Yoshi IS impossibly cute but even for a guy who likes cute stuff this game is just TOO childish.Graphics ASound CGameplay B-Lasting Appeal C"
4,He's Back!!!,Mario is back again with another great GBA title. This game has great color as well as sound. I recommend this game because there is that something about Mario that makes the game last much longer.
3,Yoshi's Island,"This title is a very excellent and overlooked game. This particular copy of the game is probably the weaker of the two available. The bonus stages are a nice addition, but the watered down graphics and music due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance are probably it's biggest killers. It is a must play game though, so if you can hold out until it might be released on the Virtual Console, I'd wait. If it doesn't come out on the VC, I'd definitely get this copy."
4,The Review for a non hardcore player,"This is an ok game. It is fun for a long time and great to play while traveling, but it often gets hard and boring. If that happens I just play another day. Buy this game it is in the ten best for me..."
4,Great game!,"This game is famous for it's original work on the SNES, and now, it's back. However, this game is NOT credited by someone who said this game was bad, this game isn't bad, it's great, it just takes a WHILE to get used to, the sounds are cute, but Baby Mario can be annoying. Anyway, the guy who said they hated this game must be a Yoshi ""HATER""!"
5,POWER TO THE YOSHIS!,"Looking for game? Looking for action? Looking for a super-cool green dinosuar dude? Yes! Yoshi's Island is the game for you! Can you help the yoshis save baby Mario and Luigi? This game is great! I beat it three times already, and I never got tired of it! The animation is great, and the bonus games are a nice touch. One of the cool things about this game is that you can play the levels over and over again! Try to beat your old score. Yes, it is possible to get 100 points on levels because I've done it on some. You just have to find lots of secret areas. I guarantee you will be 100% saticfied!(...)"
2,Definetly A Little Kid's Game,"I have all the Mario games for Gameboy Advance and decided to get Yoshi's Island to add to the collection. I ended up selling it because I didn't like it at all. Yoshi moves around to fast and it's hard to retrieve Mario when he falls off Yoshi's back. This game is frustrating and it's a huge disappointment compared to the other Mario games I've played. I don't miss ""Yoshi's"" island at all. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody."
2,I didn't like it !,"I was anxiously waiting for this game, when i played it, i didn't liked it!! It's fun i didn't like the whole thing about you protecting mario, and then he cries if the baddies get to him. Some parts are like strategically you have to figure out what to do!, I didn't liked it, but it was someewhat fun"
2,This game is great,This game is really good i thought that is was one of the best games that i have played for gameboy. It is so fun because you still have all the original enimies as the first supermario bros but there are also some different ones.
4,This proves that people will buy anything twice,"I've played Yoshi's Island before on the SNES and it's a great game. Play as Yoshi and do toung-slinging action, power-jumping, egg-making levels of InSaNe fun!! defeat giant bosses and adventure to new worlds in search of baby mario's brother, Luigi and save them from the evil baby bowser! this game is worth it so buy it before it runs out."
5,Classic Games are comin' back!!!,"I played this game when SNES was in it's prime, and all I can say is that young ones who never even SAW the SNES are gonna be in for a real treat. Dozens of hidden and unlockable levels, smooth and responsive controls, clean, crisp graphics that are easily viewable, and a really catchy sountrack. This is one game that you can't, I repeat, CANNOT miss!"
4,this game is AWSOME!!!!!! by christian domagall,"Yoshie's island is the best game I've ever played (even though I have'nt played many games for GBA) but it's the best game so far.The grafics are very detailed and there are lots of cool secrets to find.This game never gets boring! every time I play my gba I find myself playing yoshie's island.the levels don't get boring because you can do so many different things and try to beat you're old score.I don't get annoyed by baby marieo crying as you may have herd other people say if you've read some of thease other reviews.It's a pretty hard game when you first start,but you'll catch on after you play it alot like me.THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Two Thumbs up for Mario 3,"Nintendo is always right when the subject is Mario Bros., this game has pretty good graphics, interesting and original story, and most of all very fun. Also it`s very interactive and have very new and cool ideas. If you are a Mario fan you shuold have it and if you aren`t a Mario fan you shuod have it too..... it`s a game that should be in your game list."
1,"Tired, Old, Not Official in the Least","I was so disappointed in this CD. The tracks are mostly all very old, slow, and not a representation of what was really played during the Gay Days weekend at all. In fact, I doubt ANY of this music was played during the events. The DJ, Randy Bettis, didn't even spin any of the events. How can they call this official? If you want a better CD that really represents the music I heard during the weekend, and also was mixed by one of the real Gay Days DJ's, check out Masterbeat's Gay Days compilation."
4,Beautiful piece of furniture,"This is a quality built billiard table, with all the style and sophistication one would expect with a more pricey model. It does take quite a bit of time and care in its assembly , but it has drawn great reviews by those who have seen and played on it. The folks at MIZERAK respond within 24 - 48 hrs with any questions that you may have, as there are some errors in the printed instructions (minor things like ""fill the 2 holes"" when there are 6, or which end it up when securing the arch washers). Overall, I'd certainly buy it and put it together again, as it was a definite learning process and was a nice project to involve the kids."
2,It is OK,"For this price, it is OK, not great.Pros:1.Very easy to assemble, I did it by myself for about 5 hours to finish it with few basic tools.2.Looking nice for the price.Cons:1.The whole Table is not heavy enough, so if you put too much weight on one side, it may be pushed or moved, even it is on a rug.2.If you are not careful enough, you may make a big mess with glue spray all over when you assemble it. Use a stapler gun if you have one.3.Instruction is little lame, do not trust it all the way.4.compound powder is too weak, no matter how well you blend with water with it, just use regular compound if you have one.5.All panels and components are made of MDF and pressed wood. Meaning, they are not too durable. Do not screw too hard, if can be cracked easilly."
4,danner 2450 skimmer,"This is a great LITTLE skimmer. I've had a pond in my backyard for about 14 years now without a skimmer. I got tired of cleaning my pump out. This is the first skimmer I've owned. Seems a little small but works good, keeps the leaves and whatever from plugging my pump up. Doesn't get 'em all but that's ok. I've got a new pondmaster 1200 gph hooked up to it. I wish I would have went with the 1800 gph it might work better at sucking the leaves into it. Amazon warehouse used, but like new for less than half the price can't beat it. REVIEW UPDATE I have to knock this down a star. Instead of cleaning my pump all the time I have to remove leaves and other debris and the filter sponge that comes with it plugs up pretty easy-I took it out. It's still easier than cleaning my pump though. In it's defense, I do have my pond in a bad location under trees and it's low so it gets a lot of run off."
3,Specific info for specific people,"I love this but its because I am researching family histories. I was very disappointed to find this version was a reproduction and I hadn't realized it when I purchased it. However that being said, the reproduction is clear and complete."
2,Great for PDA's but not for XP Laptops,"I bought this card about a year ago after I purchased a blue tooth enabled cell phone. I wanted the capability to connect to the web using my phone with my Dell Axim X5 while on the go. It worked like a charm. The connection software that came with the card was very easy to work with and after a few seconds of setup, I was surfing the web.Setting the card up on my laptop was a another story. The card did not come with a driver that would work with Win XP. I tried to use the blue tooth drivers that are bundled with windows, but I could not get it to work. I went to the Ambicom support page to see if a driver was available. It said an XP driver was in development. That was five months ago and they still have not released a driver. So, buyers with XP laptops beware!"
1,Its being returned tomorrow!,"Bought it at Fry's in anticipation that it would work on my J720. What a waste of time and money! The drivers for HPC2000 were not even on the CD-ROM so I had to google to find them. And after I installed them on my Jornada the blasted thing did not even work! And on top of all this, AmbiCom no longer supports the card! If they no longer support it, why do they still sell the card in retail stores?What a waste!"
1,Not ready for prime time!,I bought the AmbiCom BT2000-CF Blue Tooth CF with PC Adapter a couple of years ago to use with my Laptop. It never worked right with it. They said that they would have drivers for XP. The latest driver is for Windows 2000. How old is that. I have checked their web page for the duration and have never found a driver for XP. Thus my $50.00 expendature has been a total waste of funds. That's my two cents.
2,Good hardware. Driver has issues,"Card seems well made, wireless connections worked good to about 25' max. distance. The ""Blue Neighbors"" device browser works well. I had no difficulty doing file transfer and dialup connections. Problems began when attempting to use a keyboard, the driver has no HID profiles and the bluetooth stack is not widcomm/drakar/MS V1.4+ compliant, so good luck getting third-party BT keyboard/mouse drivers to work with this card. Adding insult to injury, the driver also conflicts with the IR port in PPC2002, preventing use of an IR keyboard when bluetooth is operating.If all you need is simple networking/dialup/file push/printing, this card will work for you. Don't buy it if you want full bluetooth versatility in a PocketPC 2002 PDA."
4,A fun book,"I found this book at our local library when looking for simple spanish language books to use in our families ""learning spanish"" project. The stars of the book are a cat and a mouse. Almost every other page is a printed upon transparency that changes the location of the cat and/or the mouse.The book covers: left, right, over, under, in, out, in front of, in back of, above, below, near, far, light gray, dark gray, thin, fat, more, less, fast, slow, closed, open.It requires a bit of supporting vocabulary, but a non-spanish speaking adult can figure out the gist of almost all of it w/o a dictionary.It's an enjoyable book that the children and the adults can read and learn with. I do believe it would be a fun book for toddlers who are learning to speak spanish as a first language too."
1,Dirty FILTHY AND DISGUSTING,You would think someone would clean something before they shipped it out. This looked as if they dugged it out of the dirt.
4,See what Love looks like.,"I first read this when I was going through a vegetarian phase. My mother had it. I bought my own copy because of Laurel. The scene where she packs the lunch; she just shows you what Love can look like. Simple, humble doing what is right for another person. Her care of her craft is not to be showy or make herself feel good, it is about the benefit of her family and neighbors.I tried several of the recipies, very good but for me it is really about Laurel. It may be time to read it again."
5,still the best cookbook ever,"For ""something borrowed"" I wanted to pass onto my daughter my first cookbook, which sadly I had loaned to someone else and never received. Through Amazon I purchased a used edition of exactly the same vintage. It even felt like my old one. The bride cried and so did I. There's a reason this book remains much in demand. I fed my family from it for over a decade, and having memorized so many of the recipes, i thought I could lend the book out. Don't. Buy your own copy, keep it, share it. And one day, pass it on only to a family member."
5,Excellent Book for Medical Subspecialists,"This is probably the best reference work in this area, of what's available in print, book format."
4,Nice for the Money,For the money this was an awesome wig. It wasn't cheap looking or itchy like other inexpensive wigs. Worked great for Halloween.
2,Batteries,The batteries worked fine after adjusting the pins on a few of them to accept the connectors. The shipping on this product was poor. Fortunatly the only issues where the bent connector pins.
4,Good but not Great!,"I think 3 1/2 stars would be more what I'd rate this book. It is definitely good, but I struggled to really get into it until the last 3/4 or so.The setting is on a Arkansas farm between a land owner (Miss Hattie) and her younger field hand (Reed). The age difference didn't bother me....the boss/worker relationship didn't bother me, but it did kind of bother me that Hattie used to ""babysit"" Reed when he was little. If there is going to be an age gap, then please don't tell me that Hattie knew Reed as a child used to wipe his nose...it is just a bit creepy for me.The love story was sweet and I was glad that Miss Hattie found love...but why did it have to be with Reed? I usually like ""friends turned lovers"" storylines, but this took it a little to far for me."
3,A few new twists on an old theme,"Much of this book is traditional romance. Boy knows girl, girl knows boy but both are clueless that they are meant for each other. What is different about this book is that it takes on ageism as Miss Hattie is several years older than Reed. It's also set around the turn of the century, a time that hasn't been done to death in romantic fiction.The book's a little slow to get started but the last hundred pages are hard to put down. Not a keeper but a good read."
5,This is the book to hook an avid non-reader.,"Courting Miss Hattie has all the main ingredients I look for in a book. You have believability in the characters, laughter, heartache, tears, and the coming togather of two diverse characters.Morsi captures your heart and imaginationfrom the first chapter. She gives us a heroine that is ordinary and proves how extrodinary she really is and a man that grows into his manhood and love for Miss Hattie as the book progresses.I fell in love with her creations and hated turning the final page. I hope she publishes more books along this style."
5,Love It!,"I absolutely love ""Courting Miss Hattie"". I read it when it first came out and I think it might be the first book I read by Pamela Morsi. It is a must read for anyone who loves to read Ms. Morsi's books. I just finished reading book again and enjoyed the story again."
5,Lock out bolts,These locking trac knobs give me a little sense of security while my truck is parked in those locations of Wash DC that are sometimes sketchy. My ladder rack is now about 80% secure from theft.
1,"Fake reviews, buyers beware!","I read through all 4 reviews and found all of them were written in the same style with an ending sentence ""I *** recommend it."" Though they carefully chose different words in front of ""recommend"", it's still kind of obvious!When you look to buy a bento box, first you need to find out if the containers are microwavable. If not, the price should be well below $25. As for this one, they didn't even mention it, so I assume it is NOT microwavable.All the bento boxes are pretty much the same size. This one is definitely not a ""large"" one! When you plus shipping, this bento box is a lot over-priced compared to others that ship free from Amazon.com!One reviewer states that she uses the bento boxes to carry lunch for her BF and her! I hope they are not sharing one. If so, either her BF must have an ant-sized appetite or their food is inflatable once taken out of the box. This bento box is good for a size 0/1 girl who is on a diet, and I can't recommend it to my friends at all!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I was not surprised by the size, it was what I expected, but the picture depicted an upper tray with seperated compartments, but on the box I got it was just one large tray. This was not a problem worth dealing with all the hassles of returning, I will just live with it, make do and take it as a lesson learned."
2,Cute but pricey,"The other reviewers that gave this box are correct. It is not ""Large"" by any means, and there is assurance it will microwave. It is cute, with the bunnies and all but carefully determine whether it fits your needs before spending $30 plus hard earned bucks."
3,"Good horizontal iron, but not vertical.","The good: Lightweight, good for travel. The steam output when ironing horizontally is quite good and does a good job in ironing.The bad: The water tank tends to leak. This is especially if you stand it upright while, e.g. you are re-arranging your clothes on the ironing board. Also, the vertical steam is NOT at all effective for vertical ironing. Additionally, due to small size, one full-load of water can last for at most two shirts before requiring refill."
3,What I think,I thought it was ok because it didn't give as much stuff that tells you how they made the movie
1,Movie,"I thought it was the movie big disappointment, movie library has been very disappointing no movies we have looked for have been there"
3,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,I could not get my girls to watch this. It is a free preview but they had no interest in it.
1,Don't like casting sessions. Does anyone?,Maybe YOU do but I couldn't stand more then a few minutes. The movie was funny though! But not as funny as the book!
3,kool,"well, this is video just basicly a short summery of the book ""the wimpy kid movie diary."" So it was pretty much pointless, but at least GREG made an apearance on there...RECOMENDED."
2,Not so great for sensitive skin,"I was expecting to have great results from this product, but it didn't quite measure up. First off the cream doesn't even smell quite as good as the ones I own which was a total waste of money and afterwards it felt like there were little grains of sand all over my face which were quite difficult to wash off as well. And my skin was so sensitive that it was feeling quite agitated after using the Dermanew. I am going to send this product back right away. So if you have ultra sensitive skin or rosacea don't even try this product."
1,Broke!,"The power button stopped working 2 days past the warranty date Junk. It was good while it lasted, but I feel robbed."
3,"Great product, but problems with replacements","The product works wonderfully, but the facial foam applicator cannot be ordered individually. If used as directed, it wears out in about 3 weeks, and you're stuck paying $15 for the 3-piece replacement, which you don't need. The other 6-piece Dermanew foam applicators that can be ordered do not fit this machine. Customer service was useless. I love the product, but wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
3,"Great microdermabrasion cream, machine not","Love the microdermabrasion cream that came in this 5-piece system. Disappointed in the machine as it isn't much better than the $5.00 Dove machine, but I am using it to apply the cream. I do like the teardrop shaped application pad. It does not use rechargeable batteries. I perfer the microdermabrasion skin machine I purchased from Sharper Image for half the price with more attachments that uses rechargeable batteries . . . but I really like the DermaNew cream."
4,Soft as a baby's behind.,"DermaNew got the grit just right. It's not too gritty, it's not smooth like plastic beads that don't really work. I have to admit that I don't use the sponge applicator at all, it seems a bit unnecessary to me. However, the vibrating brush helps to really get that grit working.My skin feels softer than it's felt since I was a kid. I'm noticing some improvement of my pit scarring as well.The only thing that would improve this product would be to get rid of the foam applicator and add a revolving brush.(Sheila)"
5,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,"I LOVE THIS SYSTEM. In Fact, I loved it so much that I just purchased two more for my niece and my best friend. I use it every day, sometimes twice a day! It's addicting!"
5,Oh wow.,"I purchased this product as an alternative to microderm abrasion sessions at a salon. I just couldn't justify $100 a session when they were telling me I needed six sessions or so. So, I read the reviews and decided on this product. It's been a couple of weeks, and you INSTANTLY have smoother skin. I can tell this is really working because my clogged pores are getting cleaned out. I do not normally break out, and it has made me break out a bit more than usual, but I think it's because all this gunk is getting cleaned out.I really enjoy this, and I feel good about the purchase."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,YOU ARE BETTER ROLLING YOUR WINDOWS DOWN! THIS THING DOES NOT WORK. I HAVE A SHARPER IMAGE ONE THAT IS ALOT BETTER. THIS ONE IS A GENERIC IMITATION THAT DOES NOT CLEAN THE AIR. CRAP!!!!!!
1,Do not buy this product,"This product is useless.It is a box with a blue light that turns on and off. It does not produce that ""ion"" smell that all other ionizers produce, it did not make my car smell any different even after running it for a week (my car does not need to be turned on for 12v to work), and it makes no sound or any other indication that it is doing anything besides shinning a blue light.I stuck two of these things into both 12v ports in my car, left it for a week and nothing. I stuck my nose to it while on and it smelled no different than when it was off.Do not buy this product."
1,What is this supposed to do?,I agree with the first 3 who posted. I bought the Ionic Pro's and replacement blades and LOVE them. This thing for the car confuses me. I don't notice any difference when using it. I don't worry about turning it off since the lighter-plug doesn't work unless the car is on. I've had much better results with a few shots of NuCar or just about any Odor Gone sprays than this product. I'm disappointed and hate that I wasted my money on this.
4,Happier Hips,"What can I say but so far, so good? I've only played a part of the long program, but after 40 minutes of sun salutations and pigeon poses, I'm limbered up and ready for hours of swing dancing. Finn speaks to my funny bone with his Canadian surfer dialect, but more serious yoga practitioners might find his goofy similes annoying. Personally, when he says a a position should feel chocolatey smooth or something, it makes me realize I should focus on being comfortable."
3,I am not inspired by the winter Olympic Athletes!,"I like Eion Finn, and I like a challenging yoga practice. So, I would guess that I would love this DVD. But I don't. I like it, but somehow I don't do it very often. It's not because it is simply two challenging for me--it's challenging, but in a kind of dried out way. The commentary is kind of dry, I am not so inspired by the Olympic athletes. It's an OK disc - I do it sometimes, but it's not nearly as good as Yoga For Happiness or the Blissology series."
2,Wonder where are these reviewers coming from ???,"After reading so many raving reviews for this DVD, I thought we have to add it to our regular exercise routine. We are beginners, so started with Easy Street.This is not ""EASY"" at all! We can barely keep up. Finn's voice so low & shallow, I had a hard time to understand what he is talking about. Moreover, all these yoga routines are just regular plain ones we already learned from yoga class - nothing special other than it goes through very fast & we could barely keep up.After 15 to 20 minutes, we turned it off - a total waste of time & money. Only reason I give 2 stars instead of one is the scenery is beautiful.This DVD is definitely not for beginners. Wonder where are all other reviewers from?"
5,excellent,great book about track and field coaching. I love it; gives answers to a lot of technical issues that I never knew of. Happy I bought it.
3,A little disappointing,"My wife from Colombia loves Mafalda, and I've read a lot of the strips with her, and I thought the video would be a little more than a series of gags from the strips. There wasn't really an underlying story. Still, it was cute to see the characters come to life."
3,Better as a cartoom than DVD.,"I'm a old Mafalda fan, I love these cartoons since I was a little child.Now I have a daughter and tried to introduce her in Quino's art trough this DVD and... fail.The animation and the sound is poor, but the political content is there.Is a nice try to translate the cartoon to DVD, but...Well, I love Mafalda, so I will keep with this DVD..."
4,Good product and value,Not much else to say. It does what it says it will do. I have a Bichon Frise that has more ear hair growth than your average dog. This product works fine.
5,Great Product!,"I am amazed out how well this stuff works in my dogs ears! I have 2 mini schnauzers and have started grooming them on my own and I now realize why my dog has been shaking her ears so much! I didnt clean the hair out from their ears the 1st time I groomed them, and now I have this and it works great. Their hair comes out so easily! I am going to order the cleaner next!"
1,Doesn't work that well,I found this product difficult because my dog (Labradoodle) has super hairy ears and this powder couldn't do the job.
5,Just Awesome,I bought this for my husband as a gift since he is always cooking with ginger and he has just be ecstatic about it. It's so much better than our previous methods of zesting/shredding/chopping and is a wonderful tool if you're using a lot of ginger in your kitchen.
5,Great product! Worth it and definitely cheaper online!,"We've tried other products for our Havanese and the Hylyt Shampoo and Conditioner is the best! After shampooing our pup he normally scratches and itches but with this one seems to have eliminated that problem. The conditioner is worth every penny. We plan on trying to buy it in the future by the gallon. If you leave it on as they say for the 10 minutes, the hair ends up super soft. The best part is that his hair tangles less then it used too. We normally had to brush him daily but with this - every other day works great. It's like it makes it easier to keep his hair perfect.I would recommend this for Havanese owners who have slightly course curly style hair. My friend who recommended it uses it with her dobe and her family uses it for their poodle.Excellent product!"
1,Did not help allergies.,"My vet recommended this product for my dog who has severe allergies. This shampoo is mild, but did not help her condition. After bathing her with this, she broke out even worse. Turns out she is allergic to this product. The only product that has worked for her is Malaseb."
1,"If there were a zero, I'd give it....","I purchased this shampoo from my dog's vet. She recommended it, saying that she encourages all her patients to use it for shiny clean coats. I used it one time, four days ago, and my dog has been a mess since. Flakey skin, terrible itching, biting his fur off and creating scabby sores all over his hind end. Scratching his snout so much that it's lost it's hair and is dark pink and puffy. He panted so heavily due to the discomfort of all the itching. Benedryl did nothing to help him, and only today after trying an Aveeno bath has he gotten enough relief to sleep...and it's a very deep sleep from not getting must rest the past few days. Poor baby...I'm sorry I used this on him. I'll stick with his old shampoo. It might be hypoallergenic, but there is something in this stuff that my dog was definitely allergic to."
5,the best thus far,"This is the best shampoo for my puppies that I have used thus far. My vet switched to a different one, and it couldn't hold a candle to this one, so I had to buy it online. I know my boston terriers appreciated that!"
5,Live and Kicking,"Incredible. I have never actually seen Tupac live but watching the the concerts put me right there in the action, I truly felt like I was there. The House of Blues performance was far better quality than that of club 662, but the club performance still delivered a since that Tupac was back none the less. It was also great to see all of the Death Row artists truly supporting each other on stage; this truly displayed the fact that they were all fans of each other's music. I loved it and recommend it to all of the Tupac and Death Row fans."
4,"It's fine, but",I expected to see more Tupac on stage. I was not impressed with the dancing girls humping the stage. Tupac was a powerful performer. If you want to add to your Tupac collection why not include it?
4,"Quick, easy and tasty!",This is super easy to use and extremely tasty. I made it with fresh halibut and cooked it on the grill....perfect for hot summer evenings.Would have given 5 stars except for the price.
3,Its ok,"I was hoping for more of a history regarding El Caminos and way more pictures. It has enough informtion to [point me towards other books, I just didnt feel like buying anyother books."
2,Slipped on the ice.,"I bought this game, because if there is one thing I could expect, it was that the EA NHL series was always getting better. I was wrong this time. EA took a step back on this.PS2 revived Madden, it should have done the same for the NHL series. The commentary is [bad], the rosters, I won't even go there (shame on you), the AI; EA has promised better AI every year and I still score at will!Rosters need to be better updated for 04. The franchise mode needs to be more ""Maddenized"" and so do the custome teams. This year, I recomend Sega's NHL 2K3 and I never thought I would say that."
2,Not as Good as 2002,"The game was much slower than 2002 and had peculiar camera angles. New ""deke"" moves were disapointing."
4,To The NHL 2003 Developers...,"-- For all your hard work and innovative gameplay from the 1990's, we would like you all to take an extended holiday. Take as much time as you like, don't worry about developing the 2003 game. Just make sure you're back in the studios the last week to make a little modifications from last year.Your Pal,The President of EA Sports...P.S. I couldn't find any team rosters for the start of the 2002-3 season, think anyone would notice if we just shipped the game with last years rosters?"
4,"The Best, but not great","EA Sports has created the best hockey game out there, capturing what fans love about hockey, BUT they dropped the ball on a couple things. First, the announcer, and color commentary make obnoxious(not funny) jokes the ENTIRE game, taking away from the reality factor. I suggest turning them off. You will see what I mean. What they say is definitely ""not in the game"".Also, I had to adjust gameplay settings because at first play the players and puck move like they are playing on slush. It still has great features like a behind the scene's look at how the game is made. When it comes to next year, they should get back to reality with the announcers, and make the gameplay smoother. Oh...great job with breakaway camera, and music. Its worth it, but you might be slightly disappointed."
1,No Fun Game,"I've had this game for six or seven years, and I can never figure out how to make it work. Every 18 months or so I get bored and break it out, but I can never get the players to react to my input....it is like watching a bad game on TV....I have no control. It loads, and I can choose the teams and all that stuff, but when the game actually starts it just seems to run on autopilot. I can't make the players do anything. And I can't figure out how to shut off the stupid music when the game first opens either. I've purchased a few EA games over the years and they always give me problems in one way or another. Don't spend your money on this one."
4,A blast....,"If replay value is used as the greatest criteria for judging a game, than the latest installment in EA Sports' NHL series is a complete classic. My friends and I play it endlessly even when we build a franchise in such a manner that it is virtually impossible to lose, we still play and have a great time at that!One of the best things about this edition is that you have virtually complete control over your franchise (including drafts, waivers etc.)While the differences between the 2003 and 2002 editions are minimal at best (if you already have 2002 I wouldn't recommend buying 2003) it is a wonderful game that pays for itself in its endless replay value."
1,Huge disapointment,"I have always been a huge ea sports hockey fan until this year. Last year was great the players faces were exact, this year not even close. Yes it has a crisp picture, but when was the last time you saw the glass get broken at least 6 times a game. The manual deke is the best thing going for this years game.The worst thing has got to be the commentator's. It is still way to easy to score. Until this year i have always hated sega nhl 2k...but at least they have espn commentator's and it is almost impossiable to score. It may lack a little on the graphics but over all i just traded my nhl 2003 in for nhl 2k3 and love it. If ea could find a way to combine the 2 games then it would have the best hockey game in the world. Until then ea is a again to arcadeish, if you want a true hockey sim then purchase nhl 2k3"
4,I did find this review very helpfull.,"I haven't played this game myself, but from the reviews. I would deffinately go out and buy it myself."
1,the best of the worst,this is [awful].....the game is garbage....commentary is the worst...atari like graphics....poor...poor...poor...don't bother wasting your time
5,Awesome Game,"this game is great, I like the goalies movement when they are making saves and the cut scenes, the graphics are awesome, as long as they dont make this a blue bottom disc It could be the best nhl game ever"
2,Finally Decided to Jump Ship and Well Worth It,"I have been a loyal EA Sports follower for years. While the College and Pro Football games still remain in a class by themselves I find NHL 2003 poor at best. The game play, camera views, etc. Seems like they have really taken this one in the wrong direction. After playing this one for a couple of weeks I could not take it anymore and decided to try the 2K3 version of Hockey and boy am I happy I did. I will continue to support EA SPorts College and Madden Football but not hockey anymore."
2,Not very playable OR realistic,"They've been able to get football games to be realistic, but hockey still has a long way to go. This game isn't very playable and the action is nothing like reality. For being on a PS2 the actual game graphics aren't any better than older systems AND the action is really slow. I would actually prefer to go back to a previous game and play that instead like 2001. Rent it if you want to see what it's really like maybe it'll be different for you, but it wasn't for me."
2,Compatibility Challenge,"I don't know if the program is fun because I can't get it to work on my new computer with XP. I've called the game software company, the operating systems company and the pc company and no one seems to know much."
5,nhl 2003,"NHL 2003 is by far EA Sport's best new game. As my mom was watching play she was awed by its amazing graphics, as I am. The controls make it easy to feel like the player. Amazing dekes make your jaw drop. Plus you can manually deke! I love the Create A Player option. To add on to what I have already said the NHL Cards option is so neat. With Easter Eggs, a Task List, and special celebrations you are just plain awed. I also like the feature that you can choose your team's uniform. You have a choise of an old, alternate, or home/away uniforms for most teams. There is also an International Game Mode. There are also many more moves by the goalies. The fighting is real too, with three different types of punches. There is also a gamebreaker. If you fill up your meter and press Z, the play slows down to make you feel captured in the moment. If i were you, I would buy it, NOW!"
5,The Coolest Hocky Game,"This is the best Hocky game I have ever played. It is better than NHL 2000, NHL 2001, and even better than NHL 2002. This game is packed with things that are beyond the NHL Hocky League. I have recommended this to all of my 155 friends and they told their friends and soon every body is talking about the best Hocky game NHL 2003. I can not wait untill you make NHl 2004!FromSpider-Man"
2,weak,I thought this was very weak. confusing roster movement. game play had no significant upgrade from the previous year.
2,Same ol' Same ol'...,"Well, EA managed to sock it to us once again... NHL 2003 has VERY little changes in it. I gave it 2 stars only because I like hockey. I am thinking about taking this back and maybe trying out NHL 2K3. No matter what you do, the computer ALWAYS seems to score on practically every shot. Doesn't matter if you have the best defense, best offense, or whatever, the computer will always score, keeping the scores very close. I'm just glad I am able to take the game back. Maybe NHL 2K3 will offer a different more fresher reality to the game. Not 10-12 in the third. Might as well play baseball or football games to get that kind of score."
3,Not quite,"A reasonable introduction to this complex area, but not an entirely successful one. I got thefeeling that the book was more a vehicle for showing how much the author knew than than making a real attemptto cover the subject matter in the manner that is useful for the novitiate reader."
5,Great notebook to use for projects,"I love this notebook. I like heavyweight paper and it is often difficult to find a notebook with it. This notebook has boxes at the top for project information, dates, and page number. The numbered lines are wide enough to write legibly. The note section with no lines is great for jotting down thoughts and can be associated to numbers. Another bonus is that when writing with a pen, it doesn't show on the other side of the page. I typically use a pencil and can erase cleanly.I work on multiple projects at the same time. This notebook has helped me keep my notes organized and chronological."
3,Better options available,"The overall layout and design of the product is very nice; however, the relatively low quality of the paper significantly reduces the overall value as anything other than a gel pen will likely bleed through. I will look elsewhere next time."
4,"Its good, might be the last time some of these people are seen together","I like this time period in music, frankie still sounds good in 2002 or whenever this was realeased, I reccomend it too people from the era of this music. I have the dvd, and im sure its much better quality,keep in mind that this is from the mid 2000s, and is not recording from the singers original carrier.it can be sold as high as $10.00, and I dont believe you can find it for digital donwload anywhere."
1,It Might've Been Good 20 Years Ago,"These games look like they were originally coded for Windows 3.1. The only updates they've received since then have been to try to make them run on newer operating systems. The graphics are junk and the software locks up half the time. I think the sale price just about covers their entire ""updating"" budget. You can do better."
4,old classic game,bought for an older relative with an older computer and no online service. They approve.
1,Won't Run,This game will not load or run on my MacBook Pro. Message says Power PC application no longer supported. Would have rated zero stars but one is the lowest allowed.
2,Super Game House Solitaire CollectionSuper Game House Solitaire Collection,"The Solitaire was working fine until I updated to Mac OS X Version 10.6.8. Since then, I have numerous problems such as freezing, not opening well, etc.I am frustrated.I hope the company would give me a version compatable with Mac OS X Version 10.6.8."
4,Good Cozy Read,I have trouble finding good cozy mysteries. This one fit the bill. I enjoyed the cat's comments and actions as a fun addition. It was nice to read a mystery that wasn't so far fetched or over run with violence.
3,The firs story was great.,"The first story was great, but the following two seemed disconnected to me. Not sure what was going on. Perhaps I didn't comprehend it."
5,Praise for the Biscuit McKee Series,"Fran Stewart has created a thoroughly endearing character in Biscuit McKee--fallible enough to be undeniably human and feisty enough to be thoroughly lovable. Biscuit wants nothing more than to live quietly in the small Georgia town of Martinsville with her husband and her Marmalade cat, but fate and family don't always cooperate. Biscuit faces each challenge life throws at her--and there are plenty of those--with determination and a little help from her cat.Fran Stewart's Biscuit McKee stories are beautifully written, incorporating a blend of down-home wisdom and humor guaranteed to both charm and entertain.--Lynda Fitzgerald, AuthorIf Truth Be Told"
3,Pretty Good Chick Lit,"A cozy little mystery in a picture perfect town with quaint characters, a lovely setting. Each stereotype perfectly represented here.At first, I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the town as well as the mystery story itself, not to mention the comments by the cat. But then the little town got described again and again, every house, every yard, every occupant, every store, every proprietor. You think I'm going on and on? You should read this book!Curtains and gardens and soups and sprouts and ... and ....However, if you like this genre, you'll appreciate it probably far more than I did. The writing style was easy to read, the plot adequate, the cat perhaps the best character.I'm wondering about the next book. Maybe if the author has all of the descriptions out of her system, we can get on with the story."
5,Another Dawn by Deb Stover,"""With Another Dawn, Deb Stover makes a place for herself among those authors who have changed the genre with their brilliance."" - Harriet Klausner, Affaire de Coeur"
4,Original,I truly enjoyed the originality of the story. Although I believe in the death penalty it gives a perspective which can't be ignored. I thought the author did an excellent job in presenting a very controversial topic cleverly intertwined with a love story.
4,"Well-plotted, intelligent time-travel romance.","This is the first Deb Stover I've read and I'm now glomming her backlist. This book is definitely a book worth more than its price - exciting, passionate, and emotional. It made me think a little about the penal code as well.I actually bought the book for the cover. Don't laugh. But oh, what a serendipity! This book is a treasure."
3,Light fun read,"A light, but fun Time-Travel Romance. Ms. Stover has sassy characters that go through a range of emotional upheavals related to falling head-over-heals in love, escaping bad guys, and working through the distress of being an unwilling time-traveler. I find I need to stretch my concepts of reality and coincidence a bit more than usual with a Deb Stover Time-Travel Romance. So, if you enjoy light romance, a bit of time-travel and some suspense, this book is for you.A Willing Spirit,Shades of Rose"
3,Good but not great,"It was good but not great. I am not sure why I feel the way I did, yet maybe it had something to do with the whole premise of the story. I felt badly for the main character and his delimna but I could not help thinking if he was just honest in the beginning with Sofie then there would have been no danger at all. She was a modern lady, she would have given him a chance to explain. I found that during the reading of this book I almost had to force myself to finish... This is unusual since I usually read 3 or more books a week and never seem to tire of a book. Yet this one kinda got on my nerves."
3,I have to admit I ffwd through bits,Parts of the middle were getting repetitive and losing my interest so I skipped through those parts and I didn't understand how they got back to the future. That bit was quite confusing :/ but I wouldn't discount this author at all. It is an okay read.
2,Hijaacked?,"Excerpts from Pot Planet by Brian Paterson""Its a monstrous big Yankee 'buy buy buy smoke smoke smoke kind of party. It started out as as a nice little festival, and grew big. After last year's downer everyone is just waiting to see what this year will be like. Will it get back to the peaceful co-operative vibe or will it just get weirder?""Through the sponsorship of high-times and the arrival of american males in their droves,the cannabis cup has mutated into a commercialised shadow of its former self. Do europe a favour america and take your captilist ways home with you after the cup."
4,A Brief Overview,"I selected this for my Intro to World Religions course last semester, along with several other texts. Although I have the utmost regard for Huston Smith, I was looking for something more current, and hopefully a little more approachable for non-religion majors. Overall, this is a good text. It is well-written, approachable, concise, and covers all of the major (in terms of numbers of adherents) world religions. On the downside, it gives only a brief nod to some smaller yet vital religious traditions (1-2 pages). In fact, its overall ""flaw,"" if it can be considered such, is that it lacks the depth needed to really dig into the religions. It felt a bit like a travel guide, though academically quite sound. I would recommend this to someone wanting basic information about the world religions, but if you're after something that really explores the depth and heart of the traditions, you'll need to look further, or at least combine this with something like Smith's classic work."
4,world religions,This book gives a short review of the worlds major religions. I will use it this winter in my bible study group as a education tool. We are all Gods people and it is good to share our similarities and except our differences with respect.
5,all time favorite,"I read romance books on a regular basis and it's definitely my favorite genre. ""Walker's Point"" is my all time favorite fiction book. I have read it close to 7 times and I recently lost it and am buying a new copy. I've recommended it to Christian and non-Christian friends and everyone falls in love with it. I keep checking to see if Marilee Dunker has written any more books. I feel like so few Christian romance novels have this quality of story line, writing, and character development. A MUST read."
1,Not worth the price,I originally purchased this one instead of another that I saw that is made by Comfortemp because this is cheaper but cheaper explains the quality which was not that warm and the design of it looks much different in person than on the pictures. The tying tighter string was just hanging out and looks horrible with the hood.I ended up returning this item for refund.
2,Toy is nice but horrible gift packaging,"Ordered this plush dragon as one of the Xmas gifts for my girlfriend. The toy is NICE itself. But I did a huge mistake by letting them gift wrap the item. So I have to tell you NEVER let them gift wrap anything!!! It is awful, terrible and horrible. The funniest thing is that I paid for gift wrap about $6 and if you go even to a 99c store you will get a 1000 times nicer box for a penny.I WOULD RECOMMEND this item but NEVER LET THEM GIFT WRAP IT!"
2,Pretty cheaply built for the money,"I purchased a set of these stands on ebay. I was disappointed in the build quality: an aluminum tube with a fiber board stand and mount. The speakers were not packaged property (remember, this was ebay, NOT Amazon, or they would have been packaged better) and one of the cheap fiberboard mounts was damaged. I don't like the aluminum finish either - all black would have been much better. If I had know these things were of such cheap construction I would have chosen something else. (I would estimate that these things must be manufactured in China for a few dollars apiece).I imagine they will work. I have not yet fully set them up."
2,not what I expected,"Celebrate Spring is full of many delicious looking recipes. I was hoping for cookbook that makes use of seasonal foods and produce, but this book is more a list of spring themed party ideas (for St. Patrick's Day, Easter, various afternoon teas) each with a menu, suggestions for decorations, party favors, homemade gifts and crafts. While there are some recipes that use springtime produce like asparagus, peas, and rhubarb there are also recipes which call for fresh apricots, peaches, blueberries, raspberries, basil and other summer produce. Also, the suggestions about making spice garlands, drying herbs and the use of dried lavender seemed oddly out of place in a book about springtime. It's a nice enough book, but it's not what I was looking for"
1,It really kinda sucks,im not usally so negative but this game really sucks. The Graphics are dated. The engine runs worse than windows 2000 (sorry windows fans but its true). The units run too slow. the maps are too small or too big. the econmy is confusing. The AI is horrible. The only good point is when u fight major battles with a ton of units thats really cool. please whatever you do dont buy this game!
1,Terrible - save your money.,"A few slightly funny moments, ruined by Kelly Monteith, who introduces every video clip with a fewirritatingly unfunny remarks. It's so bad I finally stopped watching, and just tossed the DVD into the wastebasket. I wouldn't want to give this DVD to anybody."
4,Adam 12 - 7,"Season 7 completes my collection of this series and I would purchase more if they were available. However, I consider the final season a poor conclusion to the series."
5,Crime show lover,The best crime show ever from tv. Now have the complete series episodes. My favorite tv show and never missed an episode when it was on tv. The complete dvd series is worth getting.
1,this game is a waste,"I am an old-time gamer. All the other reveiws say that this game is exactly like the 60's version. I purchased this game, and it is nothing like the old; it is worse. While trying to enhance the graphics, htey took away the total effect of the game. With all the complicated buttons, it is nothing like the arcade version. If Nintendo makes old times games new again, then they should keep it the same. IF they change it this drastically, then they should rename it. This game is a disgrace to the name Pacman."
3,Nothing like the original,"This is not the age old Pac-Man... This game is very similar to Mario Party where each player races thru a coarse to the finish. There are lots of mini games that are fun, but if you are expecting dot eating, ghost munching, fruit huntinh fun don't look here."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the best party game that I have ever played. Just try it, you'll love it."
3,"Not as good as Mario Party ,but still a good party game.","Not as good as Mario Party ,but still a good party game."
5,NIce quality feel.,"I was impressed on how good the quality feels, it is nice and thick and the color and quality of the Ford logo is also impressive."
1,Disappointing,"Whether you discovered Ultravox through the John Foxx version or the Midge Ure version, you were getting a band that combined influences from punk, new wave, Bowie, Roxy Music, Kraftwerk... not faceless and bland vaguely progressive rock that makes the likes of Mike and the Mechanics or Asia sound almost edgy by comparison. Unfortunately, the latter is what you get on this disc, which combines two studio albums by two different lineups. The only thing either one has in common with any other Ultravox is Billy Currie, but for whatever reason he doesn't seem to remember what made Ultravox interesting. You wouldn't know he'd had anything to do with ""Young Savage,"" ""Hiroshima Mon Amour,"" ""Dislocated,"" ""New Europeans,"" or ""The Voice.""If, on the other hand, all you know of Ultravox is a few tracks from Lament or U-Vox and the odd Midge solo tune, you may enjoy this. I certainly don't."
4,Original sound remind me ancient Ultravox,Billy Currie made a very good job. It's a pity that Midge Ure left Ultravox because they could go on years creating masterpieces. I recommend this double CD. I think Ingenuity is better than Revelation.Buy it without doubt. Trust me!
5,What a scent!!!!!,"Besides having a lovely scent, this cream is gentle on the skin and one bottle lasts forever. I am in my third bottle now."
2,Typical New Age delusional reading,"If John Davis' ""messiah"" is that, I may apply for a job as the equally phony ""Great Goddess Diana."" Just as delusional, but a little less interesting than those books by Benjamin Creme. John Davis Coptic Fellowship would be non-recognizable to true Coptic Christians whose belief is in only Jesus as Christ."
4,awsome crossover,i bought this crossover for a DJ set up. i used a 12 volt power source and it started right up. the first thing i noticed about the crossover was that it had a bit of weight to it and it didnt seem flimsy or cheap. this is for my pyramid amplifier i purchased and it works amazing. i like the bass boost options and the gain controls. great crossover absolutely recommend this for a starter car audio system or a basic set up like mine
2,Doesn't work with Panther,"Supposedly this is a good game, but until MacPlay updates it to work with both Quicktime 6.5 and Mac OSX 10.3 it is a waste of money."
4,I played it on Mac OS 10.4.8 just by loading it twice! And it was fun!,"A couple times I had to turn the music off, but otherwise it played just fine and I am so glad I tried reloading it. I hope they come out with the thrid installment of this series soon!! It is big fun!"
1,not the size i expected,there should have been an indication of actual sizeVery small for a man's watch
2,What the description doesn't tell you,What the description of this product doesn't tell you that this is for a four legged swing set. I have a six legged swing set & when I got the package in the mail that is when I found out on the package that it was for the four & not the six.
1,"good idea, poor quality, poor design, cheap construction","Just bought 3 sets and wish I hadn't. None of them came with the number of cords specified on the box, so I had to supply my own. Good thing too, because the cheap nylon cords included are cut too short to tie. Half of the stabilizers (3 out of 6 pieces) burst at the seam. Very messy to fill the bags. You get sprayed a lot. Definitely a 2-person job. I got three of them mounted by filling them first and then hanging them on the set. Again, a 2-person job because they're heavy when filled. Of course, we only have 3 and need 6. Not sure if it's worth buying more. Probably better to just use stakes to secure it to the ground. By the way, the picture online shows 4 sets, but there's only 2 to a box. Remember to buy one for each pair of legs your set has."
1,The Swing Safe works great!,"We bought the Swing Safe Gym Weight Set last summer when we bought our swing set. Our swing set has two regular swings, a four-person bench swing, and a two-person glider. We have had children swinging on all of the swings at the same time, and the legs have not moved at all because of the Swing Safe. My husband is able to move the swing set to different areas of the lawn easily which he would not be able to do with other types of anchors. They were easy to put on the legs of the swing set, and I like the extra padding it provides on the legs. We considered cementing the legs down, but we didn't want to have to leave the swing set if we ever moved. The Swing Safe is the best thing we have found to secure our swing set while still keeping it mobile."
2,Worked... until it got hot,"Not only can you not let these ""freeze"" but they don't stand up to heat very well. We live in Arizona and they have all gotten tiny leaks in them and all but 1 (we bought 6) are deflated and useless. And, like was said in a previous review, you can't weed eat around them or you'll puncture them. If I had it to do it over again, I would NOT buy these."
4,Excellent resource,An excellent resource for anyone interested in African dance. Wyoma is a beautiful dancer and experienced teacher. She combines her knowledge of traditional dance with a modern approach especially in the warm up session. This DVD would be suitable for the classroom too.
5,for a healthy spirit as well as a healthy body,"This video is excellent for those who want to get in better shape, but hate the monotony of the average aerobics tape. If you love to dance--really set your body free, not concerning yourself with whether you're supposed to spin or dip--then this is for you. You'll be sweating after a half hour, but you'll be doing it with a smile on your face. There's plenty for beginners as well as more advanced steps. The rhythms are intoxicating and invigorating."
4,African Healing Dance,"I really liked working out with this dvd, It was instructive as well as educational. The accompaning music of the African drum is very soothing and energizing. Many of the dancing forms are free flowing and instinctive so you can have fun."
5,African Healing Dance Really Works,"From the first movement I learned I have been enjoying something real from this dvd.I bought this dvd mainly to learn an expressive vocabulary, and I find that when I hear music then I call on each new movement to express myself.I think there is a physical healing dimension in addition to wonderful, joyful feelings. I had to move slowly with my shoulders at first, due to crackles and pops the first couple of times. If I have sore muscles from other activities a little dance movement will work that out. Dance movement moves synovial fluid around like yoga and mobility drills, lubricating and removing inflammatory toxins. That is preventive as well as restorative, physically."
1,broke item but refund received,"The VHS tape would not play and upon complaint the seller refunded my money immediately. I was disappointed because i wanted the item. The seller was great, just did not test item before sending."
1,Waist of money,"The product arrived toooo late, and I could not use it for the purpose it was bought for. I relied in this product for this specific event at my job, and I had to buy a new product to complete the job. Unfortunatelly I could not get it on time, and It ruined my plans. I called Amazon, and nobody could help in any means."
5,Love it,"I am not particularly interested in African dance, but picked this video up at a thrift store because it looked interesting - I needed something to free myself up and feel more flexible - yoga didn't really do it for me and the usual repetitive exercise routines bored the daylights out of me.Doing a few movements of these dances made me feel like a new person, and much freer (I have a tendency to feel a little stiff at times because I have a somewhat stubborn streak, and it transfers to my musculature)- Wyoma has a great personality and is a wonderful teacher - the drums are great, not overwhelming, and I learned something new about African dance and culture - highly recommended, and a lot of fun."
5,Dance workout,For those who enjoy incorporating dance into their daily exercise routine will find this refreshingly different. Wyoma explains the style of dance and demonstrates at the beginning. Following this section is a warm-up before the various dance forms from different countries. I recommend it. It's simply fun.
3,Looks good but doesn't get cold enough,"I bought this a few weeks ago and it looks great. It fits perfectly in a small space along side my bar cabinet and I'm thrilled to free up room in my fridge.However, the compressor runs A LOT!! and it's a bit noisy. Most importantly, the temperature will not get below 45-degrees. Vinotemp says the temperature range is 40-60 degrees but mine doesn't get that cold -- in fact, I can't even set it to 40-degrees. The digital display won't go lower than that. I'd give this just a B-minus at best."
5,Inspiring,"Biographies of 2 of the finest Americans this country has ever produced. The Civil War destroyed some of our best and brightest. Music is excellent, the history is factual, well narrated. Buy this dvd, you won't be sorry."
5,Honorable Christian Southern Generals.,"I cant add much to the previous reviews, except, if people would only think for themselves and not let their brains be damaged by carpetbagger brainwashing, we in the South; would be looked upon and our Heritage respected as much as Others; that have contributed nothing to Society, but, Building more and expensive Prisons. When 1 can seperate from their ability to think for themselves and see that ""The War Between The States"" wasnt about Slavery, but Northern Money Grubbing; then will the Confederacy be at Rest and Peace"". God Bless and Hold General Robert Edward Lee Close To His Bosom and Also General Stonewall Jackson."
5,The exquisite machinery of torture,"Gluey Porch Treatments contains some of the most vile, depraved, and oppressive noise ever unleashed upon mankind. You can feel the doom and despair dripping from every pained vocal howl, every twisted guitar riff, and every punishing drum beat. The Melvins' mix of doom and punk adds up to a sadistic listen that is all but guaranteed to offend normal, well-adjusted people everywhere. Needless to say, I love it."
5,Aaliyah forever,It'S so sad that she died on that airplane crsash in August 2001. But we still have her wonderful songs.This one is typical for her. Her voice and the message of the song are important. It'S R n'B at its best.But why are there no Mixes on the CD?. The acapella and the instru ental version are nice but I would have loved to hear the song remixed.
4,WordPerfect 12 Quick Source Reference Guide,"I found the guide to be very helpful, easy to read and use."
3,word perfect for dummies,not as much information as I had hoped for. Extensive merges and automation were lacking.
2,For the Absolute Beginner Only,"The card is of little use to me because it so basic. I should have returned it but holidays got in the way. Any questions I might have had could be answered by using Google. I don't think it is a rip-off by any means, however."
4,My husband loves these tongs,"My husband loves using these tongs, especially for cooking bacon. The fine tip allows him to grab the bacon and flip it over with easy. We have several pairs of these tongs in our kitchen and have been pleased with how they hold up."
3,One time use,"The only reason I got this book was because it was required for my class. However, I used it ONCE. So I can't really give it a full useful review on just a one time use. I will say that for that one paper I had to write, it was a great resource. Otherwise... its probably just like any other textbook."
5,Great value!,"I'm on the 3rd day of using this product and love it! I've already noticed I have a whiter smile and I haven't had any sensitivity at all. The product comes with 20 packs of upper and lower strips- enough for 2 x per day for 10 days. I'm planning on using 10 of the packs and saving the other 10 packs to use in 9 months because I've already seen enough improvement. I don't have a celebrity-white smile or anything, but it's enough that my yellow stains from coffee and tea are pretty much gone and my teeth actually look uniform and nice. I've only used 5 packs so far and have seen great results, so I can't wait! My biggest advice would be to make sure to brush well and wipe off your teeth with a dry paper towel before applying the strips. The strips tend to move from the moisture otherwise, especially since your mouth will salivate."
2,"Good results, hurts teeth","his product made my teeth so sensitive that i could not eat after a few applications. Results did in fact show, but i had to discontinue after a few days"
2,"Not as great as expected, very painful","I have used this kit for the recommended amount of time, and to be honest I was not happy with it at all. First off, the whitening was noticeable but negligible. It was not the whitening I expected, and I did not start with excessively yellowed teeth. When I looked at the difference between my back molars and the teeth being whitened I saw a very very small difference. The real downside to these strips is the intense pain of my teeth now! Everything became painful, and everything I touched made my teeth feel reminiscent of the ""nails on the chalkboard"" tooth pain some people might also experience. I don't know how to explain it but it was painful and annoying, my teeth constantly ached even without excessive heat or cold. This pain was ridiculous, and it showed up around the 5th day, which forced me to stop the strips for a few days. I do not recommend this product at all! The pain vs the whitening is NOT WORTH IT!"
2,"Work well, but with problems","Crest Whitestrips actually work very well, but this version has several issues which would prevent me from buying them again.Unlike Crest Whitestrips I've used in the past, these are very flimsy and hard to handle and to apply to the teeth. One on, they are too slippery and flimsy to stay in place well.The heavy plastic container them came in is absurd. Why do we need a thick plastic compartment that weights 15 times more than the actual product? Am I going to save it to keep my valuables in? What was wrong with the simple paper box the other version of Whitestrips used?"
1,doesn't work!,"this item does NOT work!!! it says that it's guarantee money back when it doesn't work but it's a lie, they won't give my money back."
3,"Ok, but should be less expensive","Do you really want to know? Ok, my teeth got a little bit whither. From 1 to 10, 5 I would Say. You will feel pain and its not true that you can talk while you have the strips on. Sometimes the strips will get out of place due to the saliva that is produced by having them on. I think the price should be about $15. what bothers me most is that the part of my teeth closer to my gums look less white..eventhough the strips touched my gums too and caused pain there."
4,Works very well. Not as good as a dental whitening.,"This product took away most of the yellow on my teeth. I am satisfied with it. If I was more picky (or a movie star!), this would not be adequate and I'd need to go to a dentist for that perfect white look. I don't know if you will find this adequate or not, but it's worth a shot. I did not have any side effects."
4,"A little awkward, but worth it.","The tooth sensitivity is not so hot, but it does lessen. I am on day 3 and it was not as bad today as day 1. The only thing that I recommend not doing is smiling big, then sucking air thru your teeth. Why would I do that? To see if they were still sensitive of course... Well, they are.Other drawbacks:Leaving them on for 30 minutes.They kinda burn your tongue. (because of all the saliva you produce, which takes some of the peroxide onto your tongue)Otherwise they are great. My mom actually just got a tray from her dentist. I have not noticed any difference in hers (maybe she's not using it?) but she actually asked me if I was doing mine too. Whoo-hoo! Saved all that $$$ at the dentist and getting good results!"
2,Overrated,"I thought this stripes were suppose to whiten the teeth for over 11 months, it's been only three weeks since i finished and so far my teeth is not as white as it used to be.."
3,Painful sensitivity,"I've decided to try these again after using them several years ago. They did whiten my teeth, but I also remembered they caused my teeth to be super sensitive. My teeth do not have a tendency of being sensitive- unless I try to bite into ice cream; I cannot do that without feeling it. Before I put even the first day's strips on my teeth, I made sure to purchase some Sensodyne toothpaste, and I am so glad that I did. I followed the directions and put the strips on (without brushing first) and within the 30 minutes of applying them my teeth started getting painfully sensitive. I had such acute pain in my teeth a couple of times within those 30 minutes. Several hours later my teeth still feel very sensitive, and it is without any exposure to heat/cold. These will whiten your teeth, but you will definitely feel it."
4,Fairly good,"I used this product as described (although once I did have to ""catch up"" on my days and had to do 3 ""sessions"" in one day instead of 2). I do believe that my teeth got whiter. I had the type of teeth that all the literature says should be helped the most by a product like this. I didn't get as much whitening as I hoped but I probably had unrealistically high expectations (my dentist had told me that I simply have darker pigmented teeth than the ideal). I would recommend this product and will probably try it again in the future."
2,burned my gum,"This stuff works, but be careful! it actually burned my gum. it was extremely painful, and my pink gum burned, melted and turned into white gum."
3,It's okay so far,"It's 3 1/2 stars for me. I have one day and a half left. I saw a slight difference so far, but not so much as others. I think I might order the 10 day white strips as well. It's different for everyone I suppose. For example, others have said they are sensitive to the strips and hurt a little bit. So far I haven't had any sensitivity or burning of my gums. I just hope when I order the 10 day strips I'll see more of a difference. Also, when using the Crest White Strips you tend to salivate a bit, but that's kind of uncontrollable."
1,OUCHERS...,"I will have no idea if these significantly whiten my teeth because it hurts too much to keep them on long enough during each use.I applied the strips, and laid down on my bed to watch a show (so that my head would be tilted back and saliva wouldn't interfere with the strips).15 minutes later, a SHARP pain shot into a nerve in my upper tooth. I ran into the bathroom and immediately removed the strips. Then I rinsed my mouth with lots of warm water and used a tooth brush to get the peroxide off.I have been a coffee drinker for 5 years, so there is some yellowness to my teeth.The funny thing is, I used Crest Original white strips in high school and they didn't bother my teeth like this. Maybe when I get up enough courage, I might look into some strips that have a lower concentration of peroxide and possibly get some Sensodyne. I think the only way I would whiten my teeth is the cheap way because I can't afford 500 bucks."
1,"Pain, pain, and more pain","I waited for these to go on sale, and when they finally did, I took my $7 off coupon and raced to the store. I had used the original version of these a few years ago, and had remembered getting decent results, so I thought this version would be even better.Was it? Well I can't say because I was only able to use them twice before the pain got to be so intense that I could not even drink cold water, or eat anything warm. It was awful. The pain does not occur just around the time you're wearing the strip. It occurs all day long. And not to mention that you end up swallowing much of the gel because the strips make you salivate more than normal. So not only are they painful, but they're also a pain to use. I do NOT recommend these. Try the original version (I don't remember having pain from those)."
1,Didn't stick to teeth.,"Have used Crest Advanced Seal in past with satsifactory results.HOWEVER, purchased the Crest Pro Effects and found that the stripsfloated off my teeth within MINUTES. My experience previously withAdvanced Seal (more than once) is they would easily adhere for at leasthalf-an-hour. These didn't. And if they don't adhere, they're worthless.Sent for refund in early November and haven't heard a word since (it's nowend of December). Could be a bad batch, but I'm not going to risk againon Crest's quality control."
2,not so good,"i have tried every teeth whiting product and none of them deliver, niether does this one"
2,Wasn't painful but didn't get very good results,"I didn't experience any pain but I also didn't really see my teeth get that much whiter either. I followed the instructions exactly as described with minimal results. Oh well, I only paid around $15 so no big deal. I may try a different brand and see if I get better results."
2,Yuck and Ouch,"I am 19. I have used reg. crest white strips, and they worked fine. i figured, ""hey, premium must be better right?"" WRONG!within the first 15 minutes, your gums hurt. it lasts for two days , where your mouth is sensitive and hurts to eat. no way will i ever use all 40 strips."
1,I wish I could give it ZERO stars,"I used these as directed, and not only did they burn my gums and hurt the nerves in my teeth, they did not really whiten. Instead, they created small white dots on my teeth that look absolutely ridiculous. I now have to go to a dentist to have a professional whitening done to REVERSE the damage done by this product. I am asking crest for my money back. This has been nothing but a PAIN...literally! I guess a few lucky people did have this work for them, but I'd suggest going to a professional instead.Good luck with this product. I hope it will work better for you than it did for me!"
4,Works with some quirks,"These little strips do what they promise to do. The main negative I have for these is the price. They come in an extremely sturdy plastic box (that can't really be re-used for anything else). Occasionally, a strip will come loose after it is applied and it becomes un-usable. I had minor irritation with these but it went away as I used them. Teeth definitely became whiter. I was also able to make a few extra ""mini strips"" from the ones for the lower teeth by cutting some excess from the strip and applying to other teeth. If these were about 5.00 less per box, I would rate them a 5."
1,"Extreme pain, horrible product","I have used similar product from Crest, the 7 strip (total of 14 with half hour use every day), and had no problem specially it was much cheaper even though I bought it at Walgreens. However this new supposedly supper duper product caused severe pain after just one use (2 strips back to back total of 1 hour). It took about 3 days to recover from pain (both gum and teeth)and after 10 days my teeth are still sensitive to cold or hot food. I should have used the same old product that I had good experience with, big mistake!"
2,Problematic,"Like clockwork the lower strip ALWAYS comes off after about 10 minutes. I sit calmly with my mouth closed then occasionally get up to check my teeth in the mirror and sure enough the lower strip keeps slipping off. Crest needs to remedy this problem. The TV commercial says that you can wear these strips almost anywhere, which is a joke. You certainly don't want to wear these strips in public as saliva accumulates in your mouth. Forget about talking or exercising when wearing these strips."
2,Strips slip around too much,"It's hard for me to tell if these strips did any good (that should say enough), but they also didn't stay in place very well. They slipped around and made it awkward to speak with family (who said I sounded like I had a lisp). The strips are two different sizes, one for your upper teeth; one for the lower, but the one for your lower teeth was fatter (it should have been longer) and merely covered behind my teeth too (uh, I don't need white teeth where only my tongue can see them!). My suggestion to Crest: make both strips the same length and width."
4,What the Plus Really Means--18 months vs 12 months,"Several people complained that they thought getting 3 extra strips for the extra $$ was pointless, or led them to give this product fewer stars. In actuality, the PLUS is because this product whitens your teeth up to 18 months, while the standard Premium product is only efective for 12 months. This is also why you use this one for 10 days rather than 7. You actually are getting 50% longer effectiveness for about 20% extra money. To me, that makes a lot of sense!"
5,Works!,"I decided to give these a shot since they were on sale and was pleasantly surprised with the results. These are less cumbersome than the trays and gel provided by the dentist. Most importantly, these actually work!"
4,"Effective, but slightly inconvenient","I am currently nearing the end of my second use of Crest Whitetrips. They work as advertised. If you follow the directions and use the product twice daily for ten days, your teeth get whiter.Drawbacks:-Difficult to apply and keep in place for 30 minutes: If you try to dry you teeth before applying, they are easier to place and stay longer before sliding around in your mouth.-May cause tooth and gum sensitivity: Never a serious issue for me, but my teeth were sensitve to cold during use. This quickly goes away after ending treatment.While I have read reviews of people with serious pain from the product, those seem to be the exception. Overall, this is a great product and offers you an inexpensive method for near professional quality whitening."
4,Strips stay in place.,Worked well. The strips adhere to your teeth much better than ones used in the past.
3,"Informative, amusing and edgy...","This book has outstanding information on the realities of an encounter with an edged weapon. If you want to avoid a situation in which you can be sliced and diced, this book is for you. This book is filled with profanity so if that is offensive to you, you may want to shop for another book. This is not a book about knife techniques, and in my opinion should be read in addition to books covering technique. I did not like the any of the stances or guards shown in this work, and would look elsewhere for an alternative. Regardless of what this book may lack, the information it does provide is very useful and enlightening. I also found it to be an edgy and amusing work, and a glimpse inside a different and somewhat scary world."
4,An amusing read in a field of boring instructionals,"Over a decades has passed since I read this book, but it stands out in my memory for being as entertaining as it was informative. Marc's style of writing is easy to read and his books are genuinely amusing. I would suggest them over a lot of others in the field just for the fact that they will hold attention while others will either bore you to sleep or come off as just a lot of macho BS. Marc's gasconades ring true by contrast, and add spice to what otherwise might just be another boring instructional."
2,Of no use in the real world,This book is unfortunatly not as good as some of the authors other books. You get the idea he wrote it in one afternoon when he had nothing better to do.This book will be of no help in a real knife fight.
2,Not worth the money,This is not the best work from this author. It would be of no use to the beginner or the experianced. I would not reccomend this book.
2,Somewhat dissapointing,"My main problem with this book is how short it is. Not including the afterword the book is 113 pages long, that includes a pictures and a lot of side anecdotes. The book never really delves deeply into the mechanics of knife fighting; most of the chapters are devoted to balance training and institutional awareness, while I agree both are very important, I didn't buy this book to improve those skills. the actual knife fighting techniques aren't analyzed in depth and the pictures usually only show solid stances, not diagrams of how to transition during combat. Overall this book was simply to vague."
2,Not so good,"I have learned the basics of knife fighting from well known sources such as Keet Kune Do under Paul Vunak (same system he taught the navy seals) and the stuff in this book does NOT cover the most basic and dangerous reality of knife fighting.(like to get the longest reach with your knife, you hold it with your leading hand of course, and the hand holding the knife is also an effective target to stike with knife to disarm) I am probably not a better knife fighter than Marc is, but there are funny fighting stances that he shows that is totally a joke. Most things covered in the book are stances to conceal a knife so you a appear normal pedestrian, so you can assisinate effectively, while walking towards the enemy. (if you wanna do that just come up from behind the opponent and stab). One thing good is that he seems like he's been in lotsa fights and stuff, got lotsa ""street lessons"" you might wanna learn."
3,Damaged heater,After unpacking I found a dent and crease in the upper housing and a corner of the reflector bent up. It requires a separate thermostat to operate (not included) . Figured the cheaper sale price was because this looks more like a scratch and dent sales item. Still isn't up and running yet as I haven't made the second trip to the hardware store.
1,One of the year's worst movies,"I rented this movie because I do a weekly review for a local newspaper. I thought with so many different good actors in one movie, at the very least it would be a fair movie. At the least, right? I was wrong as this rehashed garbage featured a boring storyline, terrible acting, and is nothing more than a rather poor excuse at making ""an independent film"". Stay away by all means."
2,Crapped Out,"Forest Whitaker, Kim Basinger, Ray Liotta, Kelsey Grammar, Danny Devito, Carla Gugino. Sounds good already, right? Think again.Several loosely based gambling plots get spun together and the odds of it being interesting or enjoyable are slightly less than hitting the lottery. Not a single actor performs poorly, but there was never the threat of Oscar glory coming from this pedestrian collaboration. Too many egos grasping for the headliner role is clearly the source of this film's demise. Whoever green-lighted such latitude for guys like Devito, Grammar, and Jay Mohr - who should quit acting, forever - should be chased out of Hollywood by pitbulls with herpes. And the pitchfork carrying men who hold the dogs' leashes should be the source of infection.Keep your money. Unless you thought all the praise for Crash was deserved (hint: it wasn't), then push this aside when you're digging through the dollar DVD bin."
4,intriguing,a fascinating blend of characters that I enjoyed watching and trying to figure out. I highly recommend this movie to those that like a movie with teeth and depth.
1,Charity event for highschool scriptwriters?,"Easily in the running for worst film of the year. Not the best cast in the world can save this schoolmasterly predictable hundredth edition of the same old lame addiction and emotional abuse story collection.What were they thinking, the Whitakers, Basingers, de Vitos, Liottas, Roths...? Probably nothing. Best that can happen for them is if nobody notices this piece of incompetence."
2,a lesson in missing the mark...,"When I saw this great ensemble cast I thought wow, it has to be decent; then a professional poker player recommended it. Okay I'll rent it. Wow. Very painful to watch. The biggest problem I could see is the writing; specifically the story lines are very weak and the dialogue between characters is absolutely awful. So many stereotypes and cliches. I did manage to make it through the entire movie but was very disappointed overall. Kelsey Grammar is in the movie for about four minutes total and his is by far the worst performance of the bunch. Ray Liotta is passable as is Whittaker. Bassinger and DeVito are very mediocre which led me to conclude that the director is as much to blame as the writer. I would not watch it again and would not recommend it."
3,worthy of a rental.,"The acting is strong here. Danny Devito is quite a captivating actor. Even Money is worth the price of a rental because you'll get your money's worth. Still, it seems like a B movie since it has no real blockbuster stars unless you think Kim and Ray are prime box office. Good script however and good moments of real drama. Here is a story of lost souls with gambling problems."
3,Worth Viewing,"Over the weekend, I watched Even Money. It reminded me of Crash in terms of how the movie flowed. There were four or five characters. The film revolved around each of their lives. The common element among them was gambling.I read some of the reviews before watching the movie. Overall, the movie is worth renting. It is not great, but it is an okay movie."
4,"Perfect, perfect game!","What a wonderful little game! I was shopping with my 4 and 8 year old kids, and a clerk recommended this for all of us. My kids are actually coming up to me and my husband asking if we have any work (i.e. chores!) for them to do! Now if only there was a game that would teach the males to close the lid!"
3,"no title, sorry","i have animal crossing, and its great if you love simulation games. i'd describe this as a sims for beginners. people who play lots of simulation games should stick with sims. animal crossing is very light and no real things are nessicary for survival for your little you. great if your just getting into simulation games, but should give you a... oh lets call it a beginner sim class in less then a few months. if sims is way too hard for you, this is a good game to relearn the basics."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!(really),"Animal Crossing is very fun.You can get a job,do mini ones for friends,decorate your house,find special NES(Nintendo Entertainment Systiem)games,make friends,plant things,go to special events,get clothes,and seriosly,hundereds of other things!You can chose either boy or girl,so it's REALLY for either gender.The game goes by real time,so if it's winter,summer,ect.,so is it in the game.If it's Monday,Saturday,ect.,well,you know.I would give this game a 17 out of 5,but oviosly I can't do that.I more than highly recomend getting this game."
4,SHORT TIME PLAYER BIG TIME FAN,I only got to play for a few days at my cusions house and it was awsome I hope to get it for christmas this year.It has so much to do it probly wont ever end.(to get hints about the game go to www.gamewinners.com).
2,"Alright, here we go","I rented this game for about 2 weeks before x-mas. I really love the sims, and strategy games like it. This game was a lot of fun, being able to do all these everyday activities on the screen... But then I realized, this game is a waste of time. It's so pointless and boring after a while. Why would you want to be addicted to a game like this, when you could be doing so much more in real life. I mean it was like the same thing every day, you look for fossils, shake the trees, put some more tacky furniture in your house, and all for what? I think that if you want this game you either have to be willing to play it for an hour each day. Personally, I think you should think about it and really think, is this worth it?"
4,For humans that can read...,"My six year old loves playing this game. The game writers boast of the real-time synchronization, and that you can set the game's time to mimic the actual time where you live. This allows the sun to rise and go down at the same time as your sunrises and sets etc.You enter a town inhabited with animals and build a nice place for yourself. There is nothing questionable about any of it, so it meets its rating. Some of the text is even quite humorous.There is one double edged sword to this game. That is the game is based on the conversations between you and the villagers. If you child does not know how to read, then you had better numb your brain and sit back in a comfortable chair, cause it's going to be a while. On the other hand, the game allows you to interact with a software keyboard and it does encourage spelling and reading.All-in-all, I prefer the games that just require motor skills. :-)"
3,It used to be very adicting.,"This game used very fun digging up tresure, going fishing and going bug hunting. And about 2 months later this game got boring catching new bugs are hard ,catching new fish is hard and finding treasure is a little hard. If I were you I would not buy this game."
5,The Sims for animals,"Animal crossing is a fun game. I'm a 9 year old girl and I like it because you can dig, talk to friends, and decorate your house. I don't like the work much, but hey, how else are you supposed to pay for things. You can create up to 4 characters and each can give a lot of different opportunities. If you are a young kid like me, then Animal Crossing should be right up your alley."
5,Living on your own?,This game teaches kids how to live on their own when they get older. They can build their own house and you get cool furniture and clothes too! They love it!
4,Not worth [the money],"Okay okay... a new rpg for gamecube. For the firt couple of weeks, this title was flawless. But then it started getting repettive. It got boring. There was nothing else to do, I had completed everything worth completing. If The Sims appeals to you, then rent this game. Otherwise, save your [money]."
5,Animal Crossing Sounds AWESOME!,"Animal Crossing sounds great! I've read so much about it and I am getting it on the first day! A word of advice. If you like this game look into harvest moon games! btn and 64 are the best. Animal crossing is a communication game that can last for years due to its internal clock. You can buy nes games for your house, design your clothes, get graded on decorating, go on treasure hunts, catch bugs, and so much more. But don't get fooled buy its cute appearace, it will be awesome!"
1,Animal Crossing: #6 in the top 10 worst games of all time..,"This game is definately one of the worst games I've ever played. It has no plot. It makes no sense. There is no winning or losing. You can't die. This is a kiddie game with no challenge at all. There's just nothing to do. Take my advice, take your $50 and go buy Star Fox Adventures. I got Animal Crossing and found out what a horrible game it is. I took it back and exchanged it with Star Fox Adventures. Now there's a good game.Bottom Line: It just sucks."
1,Welcome to Preschool land,"I don't understand. All you do is do happy little tasks for apparantly lazy animals. On my friend's game, the creature called ""bluebear"" will swear at you. THis game is horrible. DO NOT BUY IT."
3,SELLER SENT THIS TO ME SCRATCHED TO DEATH!,"The seller told me that the game would be like new or in VERY GOOD used condition, but the game came scratched to bits! I was so afraid that the game wouldn't even run in the Nintendo Gamecube. I purchased the videogame as a birthday present for a friend so I didn't even have a Gamcube to test the game out in since I do not own the system. I had to wait until his birthday passed so that he would open the present and try the game.Luckily, the game has run smoothly SO FAR. I hope that it continues to do so I will be very upset for the false advertising."
4,WOW ANIMAL CROSSING RULES,"i thought this game would stink but then i saw the different things you could do and the weird looking characters were really awsome i think that if you like goofy, crazy,& adventure games you will like itthe only problem is that if you are all by yourself and your playing that it will get very boring fast"
5,BEST GAME IN HISTORY!!,"This is the best game I have EVER played! I first played it at my friend's house, and now I'm gonna get my OWN gamecube for my birthday and buy Animal Crossing, no doubt! _^^_ I can't wait!!"
5,A Second Life,"I am a subscriber to Nintendo Power and I saw Animal Crossing from E3 2002, the game looks like no other game I have seen before!!! When you first start you get to name a town that is diffrent from other Animal Crossings, when you arive a monkey greets you and asks for your name. Soon you will meet Tom Knook who will let you choose between 4 houses for you to live, but you don't have much money so he loans it to you until you can pay it off. The time runs by the real time of where you live!!! In one day you can watch fireworks, catch frirflies, bees, and fish, pick apples, buy clothes, furniture, and a coke machine!!!"
5,So addicting!,"Don't buy it! Its way too cute and addicting... I got this as a birthday present and spent weeks fishing, shopping, and talking to villagers and even running a few errands for the lazy villagers ( I wish they would pull weeds once in a while!)I found out that the seasons even change, and on your characters birthday all the villagers send you gifts! Theres also celebrations on New Years Day, Halloween, Chirstmas, and much more. Where you can get gifts form the mayor just for being there! The whole game is so fun, and is always changing!Tips:On Chirstmas the only way to get a present is if you buy a chirstmas tree from Nook and put it in your house!Before Halloween buy lots of candy to give to villagers and in exchange they give you gifts!Always pull weeds... ALWAYS!!Don't go wacking villagers on the heads with your shovel!! ( for some reason they don't like that too much...)"
5,Our entire family loves this!,"I bought this game for my five-year-old son who was insane with jealousy over my Harvest Moon game. I thought this one would be more to his liking. It turns out our entire family LOVES Animal Crossing. We enjoy setting up the houses, sending each other presents, and visiting each other's towns. I have found the game to be a little addictive, but I also find that it is teaching the children time and money management, debt control, etc. A very fun and cute game!"
5,I'm absolutely addicted to my daughter's game,"Adorable characters and something different everyday. Hard to miss a day for fear of missing out! Stay away from town too long and you will get cochroaches in your home. Real time game/holidays celebrated etc...My daughter's reading actually improved as she read along with the banter of the animals. It's me, though, Mom, that is addicted to this game. I play it while she's at school!"
5,Great Family Game,"Although it's for a single player, our whole family created a human for ourselves. The game is very addictive. It teaches children that they have to work to get what they want. Adults find it addictive just to accomplish being the first with the mortgage paid off or to be the first bellionare. This game is recommended for any family with children 12 and under. Not all games have to be violent to be fun!"
2,"Gets Really Old, Really Fast","This game gets quite boring after awhile. After meeting all my objectives there was nothing left to do. Interaction with the animals can be slow and frustrating. Letter writing is also slow and tedious. Good for very young children, my little niece and nephews (ages 4-7) seemed to like it."
3,ggets boring as hell after a while,most of the people who gave this like five stars dont like it now. they get it there LIK OMG THIS IS SOOO COLL OMG!! a fiew months later it gets repeditive and boring. the world is sooo smallll errr i got so bord of it i boght 4 mem cards and started like 4 other towns so i cold visit them. whitch was fun. like if you plant trees there from your world there worth 500 bells and the fruit there is worth 400 bell in my world. (so i got ritch pretty fast) get it if you want its realy fun for a fiew months or a year but ehh! w\e your choice. overall i give it 50% rating.
2,Why are they so mean,"Well I Got the game because I thought it would have cute animals . Well If you call animals that call each other names , say you are lame , fight and just plain act rude. Then I guess this is the game for you . But I dont think small kids need to see game animals act so bratty . I would also like to know why so many of the girl animals seem so stuck up and obsessed with there looks ? I think the game was made by a guys . I also found it anoying that the store was closed so much of the time .The game is O.K. but slow and my kids hated it . Also to the reviewer that said there 3 year old can play because the game was mostly icons . That is just not true you have to read all the time and write letters . But when you get letters back they will tell you that you are hard to under stand or you just are dumb. If you just want to kill time then play . But becareful they might hurt your feelings ."
5,chalupa rules the hizouse,"animal crossing is by far the best game ever made! it is so much fun you will buy tacos! I command you to buy tacos! the animal crossing is fabulous and fun! it's a whole basket full of fun, a very large basket, bigger than that basket over there! i dropped out of school so i could spend all day playing it! monkeys couldn't pry me away from it!! your head will itch with excitement, or lice, you decide. it's better than jesus! wild, crazy horse puppets will attack you if you do not buy this game! i highly recommend this game for everybody, especially losers with no lives, like me and the schmedmiester. it will blow your mind away, not up, away. screw rover!"
2,A game for little kids,"This game would probably be fun to little kids, but I really disliked it. Very boring and no practice of free will. If you're 12 or over, don't do it!"
2,Very Boring Game,"I will start by saying that my sister is an addict of this game. So is my friend, who has not only moved into town but has already payed off and made an addition to his little virtual house. I, personally, can't stand this game.I have played this for maybe 30 minutes, and that was enough for me. Very slow paced and boring."
1,Could have been fun,"The game itself was OK but seemed very much geared to kids. The game keeps real time and since the stores in the game are only open from 9 am to 10 pm, you can only play the game during those time frames. Other than that, there isn't much to do. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Somebody stop me!!!,"A detailed description of this game has already been given in many of the other reviews here. The one thing I find to be lacking, however, is an accurate conveyance of just how INSANELY ADDICTING this game is! Honestly...I've been playing it nearly non-stop since I bought it. I've sacrificed countless hours of sleep for this game. It has totally consumed me. :P I'm sure most of you will find this review to be completely unhelpful, but for those of you who have a tendancy to let games get in the way of the rest of your life...BEWARE! Great, great game."
4,"Not too exciting for some people, but great for me!","Animal Crossing is a game where you are just a normal person who has a job, and buys a house. You can do errands for your neighbors, or you can plant trees, or you can relax and just go fishing. If you do errands for animals they will reward you with clothes, furniture, etc. Complete your job and pay off the rent for your house, to earn a bigger house and more furniture. you can connect to other Gamecubes to have friends move to your neighborhood or move to a friend's neighborhood. Most people I know say the game is very boring, but I'd give it 5 stars no matter what!!"
5,Best game ever!!!,I think this is the best game because you get to live your own life design your own clothes it's almost exactly like real life.You don't even have to live with your parents you can even have your friends move to your town!
4,Simple Fun,"I received this game for Christmas without really knowing what it was about. I read alot of the reviews here at Amazon before finally deciding to play. At first, I was thoroughly bored. It seemed too easy, and was becoming disgusted quickly. Then I had my 7 year old daughter join me in playing. It was alot more fun to write her notes and send her presents in the game...and to ultimately help her out. I am now also finding the game more fun as I am progressing in it. The one thing I DO NOT like about the game is the fact that is runs in REAL time...and when they say REAL time they mean it!! 5 minutes in real life...5 minutes have passed in the game. Everybody in the game goes to bed around a certain time...so if you are a night owl, you should surely set the clock different than the actual time. Still, although this game is fun, I would reccommend it for younger kids."
5,Animal Crossing,I've only played it for a little while but it's the best game I've ever played. It's totally COOL!!! Check it out sometime.
4,Animal Crossing,"The basic story goes that you, the character,is a human. You are moving to your town at the beggining of the game. You can choose your name and your town's name. Once you start, you have to buy a house.But, you don't have any bells (the animal crossing currency), so you work at Tom Nook's store. You pay off your debt for the house by doing jobs for him and other animals in the village. Once you pay off your mortage, you can add stories, basements, and you can buy furniture, wallpaper, and carpets. The further you get into the game, people will start moving in and out of your town. If you have a friend who plays animal crossing as well, borrow their memory card, then you can go to their town, and talk to their character. If you are buying animal crossing, you absolutly MUST have a memory card. Some games are okay not to have a memory card, if it only takes a few minutes to get the things you need. With Animal crossing, however, if you don't save, you have to start all over again."
3,"OK, NOT GREAT","When I saw commercials and advertisements for this game, it looked so unbelievably cool. I had to wait a while to get it, and when I finally did, I was psyched. This game was the best! You could do so many different things! Unfortunately, after about a month or so, this game got pretty repetative. So, I stopped playing it for a couple months. When I went back on, every villager in my town was totally flippin out at me. That's one thing that makes the real world time take away from the game. This game is so addicting that you play it every day for hours until you've played out your interests. Overall, I'd rate it a C+. This game is BEST PLAYED IN SHORT BURSTS!!! Don't buy it unless you have way too much time on your hands, or you're in college."
3,Great for kids! 22nd june 2004.,"If it ever says that it is fun for everyone, then don't listen. Even though it is quite a good game, it is also quite babish. Great for a 6 year old. Maybe the game gets better as it goes along, but the graphics and setting is more for a young kid. THEY WIL LOVE IT."
4,The Best Game,"I want this game because I think is very cool. You can go fishing and have two house in this game. You can make a sister and play with her, but little kids that is under 8 can't play because to play is game you have to know how to read to know want to do. If you want, you can read it for them and tell them want to do so they can play well. I don't have this game, but I will get it. I will play it everyday. I going to be so much fun and an so happy."
4,Lots of fun for kids,"My kids, ages 8 and 6, love this game. We only allot so much time for them to play the game cube, and this is the game they always choose to keep up with. They love fishing and decorating their houses. I played a bit when they first got it, and it is fun. Although I know it's fun for some adults, it's obvious this game is geared for kids, it surprises me that adults here give it negative comments because it's too juvenile for them. One look at the box cover should tell a person who likes action games it ""might"" not be right for them! And you don't have to play it for hours and hours to keep up, we don't allow that here, and the kids still love playing with the time they get."
3,This is a helpful review for animal crossing.,"Animal Crossing is very fun. There's one teeny problem. First you will get adicted to it and play it all the time, it will become very important to you to do it... maybe even part of your daily routine. Then after you do it for a long time you get very tired of it. I mean, it is my favorite game, but i get tired of it... then after a long while you play your long lost game and the whole daily routine thing starts all over again. Buy it for your child, just make sure you let them do it! Don't worry, they'll get tired of it! :-)"
5,Animal crossing is #1!,This game is the best! I have never seen a better game! I never want to stop playing!
4,Animal Crossing,"Decent game, VERY involving must go through a lot, almost daily play runs on REAL time. Lots of ""underlying"" cool stuff stay active with the game and do work for other characters and you may be rewarded with NES games like legend of zelda, mario bros, punchout, and others. definitely a cool feature. this game is kind of like a sim game you will get involved with lots of stuff to do. You can link you gameboy to this game for more advanced game play (new areas, new saves, this is a very advanced game in a easy way)"
5,A whole new experience!,"Animal Crossing is a whole new experience in the gaming universe. I probably can't say what nobody has but man this game is amazing. As you probably know there is so much to do and see n tjis wondeful game/ It is sort of like the mix of an RPG, The Sims, and some kind of RTS. I'll tell you all I can tell you about this game that I can.In this game you begin by buying a hose. You have to work off all the money and then live it up. You can buy tons of stuff from the local minimart (Nook's Cranny) send stuff to the museum, make friends, send letters, get gifts etc. etc. It is a great game, definetly reccomended for everyone! :)~Daniel~"
4,"a very good,long lasting experience!!","Where should i start.This game is phenomenal!!I recieved it as a birthday gift when i turned twelve.What's that you say,a twelve year old playing a kiddie game?!?This may seem a kiddie childish travesty,but once you start playing,you will realize that it takes a level of maturity that most kids do not have.There is an endless list of things to do!!.The only major problem is that the game gets pretty boring after a while,but thats not going to ruin it for you.Also,the graphics are third rate,but they wont ruin it for you,either. Overall this is a solid gaming experience for older children."
4,THIS SO ROCKS!!!!!,"This game is so awsome. You can fish, catch bugs, visite the tailers or museoums,go to parties, help people, go to the lost and found and the dump to find free stuff, shop, add to your house,mail a letter, and much,much more. I love this game, come visit me in bob town, my names bob with a cat head next to it. I hope you enjoy this game!!!!!!!!!"
1,BO-ring,This game sucks.It isn't even like real life. After a little while this game gets boring.Even after you fill your house there's nothing to do.Your town doesn't even have anything in it.This game sucks unless you're a toddler.
1,This should be sent 2 Death row,You shouldnt waste time on a lame game like this. Its slow going and there is no action what so ever. First things first.Graphics:3/10Sound:1/10Fun:0/10Overall:1.2/10Do NOT waste your time on this...
2,fun but,"when you finish the game, there is no fun. If you have a kid that is young, it will always be fun forever until they get older. RECOMMENDED or PEOPLE under 8."
4,A Whole New World,"You feel like your free when you play this game. Your own house in a neighborhood, events and holidays. It is a lot of fun!"
3,Animal Crossing,"Animal Crossing is a simulation-communication game that immitates real life. Even if you are not playing the game, life for the other citizens of the city you get to name still goes on as normal. If you go long enough without playing, your house will be overrun by weeds and bugs. And don't dare to reset the game! You can visit one of your friends's villages if you bring the memory card that is included in the game. After a while, though it gets pretty boring. There isn't much different to do each day. You can access a secret island if you hook up your GBA to the GC. Overall, it is an ok game that I would just rent, not buy."
3,"OK at first, but eventually gets boaring","When i first played this game i thought it was amazing. There seemed to be so much to do. But after a while there's not that much to do. You build a house, and use the money you earn either catching bugs, fishing, picking fruit, doing errands, or digging in the ground. After you upgrade the house 3 times that's it. People say its just like real life, but its not. Its defidentally not infinate. People who buy this game need to get a life of their own, instead of playing a limited one on a TV screen."
4,This game is fun for about 2 weeks!,I like decorating so I might as well just get the sims which is of course way more realistic. There is nothing to do after awhile playing animal crossing! I suggest renting it first.
5,Great Game but can get boring,"This game is really fun for a while. But, once you get your house as big as it can get, it can get boring. One good thing about this game is that every once in a while somebdy comes to your town. It could be a bird washed up on shore, Crazy Redd's black market, a traveler, a fortune teller, or a stuck up giraffe. You can create your own patterns at a shop, buy and sell clothes, furniture, or flowers at Tom Nook's, go to the police station (this only has lost and found), or go to the post office.In this game you can join the HRA. This is a group of people that grade your house. The higher your house grade, the more new people come to your town. On sat. nights at 8:00 pm to 12 midnight, a guy named K.K comes. You can get music recordings from him.There is a lot of awesome stuff about this game. But, it can get boring. Oh. Also, you can't win. It is like the sims. Play till your sick of it. I would buy this game if I were you. Really!"
5,"Stupid, insanely fun game","This game is very fun. It is simple- anyone can play it. You will find yourself getting attached to certain villagers... and hating others. You can do so much in this game, like designing clothes, collecting furniture, playing NES games, etc. You'll never wanna turn it off!"
