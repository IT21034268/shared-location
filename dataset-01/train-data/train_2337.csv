3,in regards to the previous review,"I haven't read much of this book but just by paging through it it appears that the majority of the book is translations of hieroglyphic texts, accompanied by the hieroglyphics, so the previous review should probably be taken with a grain of salt."
5,a skaters reveiw,ok guys before u read this rember i just airsoft 4 fun ok guys this is an ok gun it is practicly the same as a stinger r36
1,Disappointing for a first year grip,"When I first learned about this book I was so excited. I had just started gripping on feature films and I thought I would be able to pick up some tips. Sadly, while Mr. Uva has been Key Gripping for years, he fails to provide true insight. While this book is great for people who have never worked with film equipment, at 30 clams, I regret the purchase. If you have gripped before, I would pass on this one."
4,Required reading for 1st Barbeque,"I wish someone had shown me this book when I first started out. The best grip equipment reference out there. The Tricks Of The Trade sidelines are also helpful. I first became familiar with the Grip Book in the form of a dog-eared first edition (minus the cover and splattered with diesel fuel) via a very kind but crusty generator operator in Phoenix, AZ. The book answered all of the questions I was afraid to ask.This new edition has info on cranes that is worth the cover price alone.My only criticism is that the syntax, spelling and proofreading is lacking. And, yes. It Matters!"
4,Great reference for novice and pro alike.,"I use this book in teaching field and studio production, and advanced camera and lighting techniques. Great reference, sometimes a little overwhelming for the beginner, but well worth the price of admission. Topics treated with professionalism and humor -- a grip with a grin!"
3,darn!,"...i thought this book would contain techniques how cranes and dolly's are built and how to use them, instead of that they show you some clamps and strange devices, and the rest of the book (3/4) is just a crane/dolly catalogue, only pictures and specifications, this book is only suited for people who want to see and know about all the crane types and some small devices (hooks and mounts). altough i was not interested in this subject of the book i read it and found it interesting"
4,Excelente libro para referencia,"En este libro el Dr. Fernando Pico, utiliza un excelente esquema para trazar una linea sobre la historia de Puerto Rico. Cabe notar que, asi como lo menciona su titulo, esta obra es general y no se encarga de ser especifica en detalles sobre los temas que abarca. El autor utiliza una buena fuente bibliografica, la cual puede servir para futuros investigadores y estudiantes universitarios. En resumen podemos concluir que es una obra la cual puede ser utilizada desde la escuela superior como a nivel graduado."
5,Father & Son - great team,"Zakir Hussain, a deciple of his father Alla Rakha, is a great musician. He is one of the pioneers of asian fusion music. Alla Rakha, who played with Ravi Shanker and other artists, has teamed up with his son to produce this amazing cd. if you like indian classical or fusion music, this is a must buy. Zakir has also played at San Francisco's Jazz Festival and other places."
4,Good cymbals...but NOT for belly dancers,"I purchased these finger cymbals to use in bellydance. Sadly, being a newbie, I had no idea what I was doing. Anyone looking at these for that purpose would be wise to steer clear. Purchase a good quality set of lighterweight zills with two elastic holes instead.If you're confused about the star rating, I rated these a 4 because as cymbals go, they truly do have a beautiful tone, are of of superior construction, and would definitely be an asset to the percussion section of a band or orchestra. But they're far too heavy and unwieldy to be used as zills for bellydance."
3,"Better horror, less porn","like hostel without the hour and a half of porn before you get to the gallons of gore. Sure theres some T&A in this one, but its about five minutes tops, because unlike Hostel, it was just a scene, not a major part of the movie. So if you like your fakey eastern european horror flicks gorey and not whorey, you'll like this one."
1,train is lame,dont waste your time stupid moviestory line sucked hostel on a train basicaly only good thiong about it was the wrestling
3,Hostel vs. Rerun,"Train is a decent torture film, no more, no less. The torture scenes were well done and succeeded in leaving your stomach feel a little squirmy, the acting and special effects used were very well done and the shock value was created using brutal violence rather than loud noises which is always a plus...but the predictability, poor plot build, and ending just killed this one for me. Worth a view."
3,Train not bad,I thought this movie was pretty good for a low-budget gore fest. The gore scenes where really gritty. I also enjoyed the main character.
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Gore, blood, horrible acting...all wrapped up into a train. I couldn't even watch the enrire movie it was so bad."
2,Gross and Intense yet not Frightening.,"This is not the intelligent horror movie the director wants you to think it is. There isn't a single scarey moment in it. It is gross and it is intense. It is also brutally realistic pointless gore with a very lame plot. The actors all do a decent job considering the lame material they have to work with. The Bulgarian actors are especially good.The story of all this torture being for medical purposes is extremely thin and makes no sense when you think about it. Do people de penile transplants? Do people recover from eye transplants in a matter of hours? Do you really harvest organs with a circular saw in a filthy non-sterile environment? Heck, do you perform any sophisticated medical procedure on a moving train? Don't think so. So, once you come to that conclusion, the story is just idiotic with some great make up. The train can be a great vehicle for a horror movie, but this totally misses the opportunity to be an intelligent, interesting horror movie."
3,Train,"Not bad, it wasn't a complete train wreck. I have seen the basic story before so it was easy to pick up on it. Gore was pretty heavy, so if you like the blood and guts, this one will do it for you. I have to say that Thora's character was pretty good as the movie advanced. No true surprises, but it was a decent enough movie. I'm pretty hard when it comes to reviews, so most of you may love it."
4,container,sturdy and convenient. Was having a hard time finding one locally so the ease of ordering on-line was most welcome
5,Good product!,"Container is build well and very easy to put insulin needles in. I use a pen, so I don't put them in the container, but it has a slot for ""TB"" syringes.Very happy about my purchase and will continue to use and resupply when needed."
4,Great little lamp,"If you quilt or embroider of crochet, you'll love this lamp. It took a little getting use to but it will make a difference. It is also nice for reading when you don't want to light up the entire room. For example, when someone else is watching TV."
5,worked fine for me,"I have used this battery with no problems. I use it frequently, swapping it our with the original. I can tell no difference in the two. I did have to use a sharpie to draw on the arrow. For the price it rocks."
1,completely worthless,"I wanted to buy an extra battery for my camera and thought I would roll the dice on this one since it only got one bad review and seemed to work quite well for everyone else. I charged the battery fully and put it in my camera right away, but the camera did not turn on. This battery didn't even work for me once. It was only five dollars, so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I would highly recommend trying a different battery if you need a replacement."
1,UNABLE TO CHARGE AFTER FIRST CHARGE,"Again, another cheap battery. I ended up going to Best Buy to purchase a legitimate replacement. Don't be suckered in by these cheap, ""high capacity,"" ""quality"" batteries like I was."
5,Great for the price,"Got these batteries to supplement the originals without paying an arm and a leg (hands and feet included). All of them charged up, all of them work. It's great for all the P&S cameras that I got for the family so we can all share the batch. No issues with the SD1100, SD450, & SD780IS. Besides, if it didn't charge up, not a problem. It was a very good deal. Even with shipping, I saved over 90% over a regular OEM. Can't go wrong with that."
4,It fit in my camera!,"I have a Cannon that is five years old and was thrilled to have found a battery for it, since the old one didn't hold a charge anymore. I was a little worried, because it looked a little different from my old one, but it's good. It works! Plus, this is a great price!"
4,So far so good,So far this battery is performing just like it is supposed to. I can't judge about battery life yet as we haven't used it that extensively yet. But it is so far better than the old generic one that died.
1,Too short a life,This battery originally worked well but quickly became unusable because it couldn't hold a charge. I recommend trying another aftermarket battery or sticking with the canon brand to make sure you don't end up without juice.
1,May be mine was defective?,"Can take 6 to 8 pictures and it goes dead. For reference, my other battery still works and I can take at least 100 pictures with it."
1,After the second charge it will not hold a charge,"This battery last a reasonable amount of time when it was first charged, then after the second time it was charged is shuts down camera right away"
1,Not a good deal,"For $23, you get two packages of curls. They run about $6.50 per package at my local grocery. When I complained, I was sent two more packages, so this was a better deal, but still not what I would expect from Amazon. The listing is vague as to what you get and I'm not sure whether I was supposed to get more than one package in the first place. However, my dog loves them. I will buy them locally from now on, or at least until Amazon gets a better listing and better price."
3,So - So,"Mountains beyond Mountains is by far Kidder's best work. Hometown and House are pretty dull. This book is OK. Is well written, evokes emotion and you can really feel Vietnam but I agree with some other reviewers that it is a shame how he does not come across as dedicated to his mission. The attitude seems to be to do as little as possible and just get by. On the other hand maybe I am too idealistic about how the situation was/should be."
3,Eastern Liberal Puke,"While listening to My Detachment by Tracy Kidder, a phrase I heard before kept flashing through my pea brain ""eastern liberal puke"". Here's a guy, in college, joins the ROTC, goes to Vietnam, and spends most of his time belittling other officers and his mission. Thanks goodness the Draft is over if this was the caliber of the officers in Vietnam. (Has any military leaders ever come out of the Northeast???) I doubt if I would have been any better as a military officer in my early twenties, but hopefully I would not be moaning and groaning the whole year long, and the rest of my life. But you have to give Kidder credit for writing the book, it's not easy to open your soul for everyone to see."
2,A Baby Boomer Goes Waaah,"Being a Boomer myself, I heard a lot of myself in this book. If you're of the generation below this is a must read. Here are all our faults and foibles. Here you will see how unapologetically self-centered we are, how weak we felt over against the generation that went before us. Finally, if you want to read an atypical book about Vietnam, this is the book. For the vast majority of those who served in Vietnam this is their story."
2,Where's The Beef !,"An Ivy Leaguer becomes a rear echelon officer lacking leadership ability, never sees combat, but writes home about the dangers he faces being at war in Viet Nam. Decades later he decides to write a book about his war time experiences. This book is well written but pretty ho-hum."
2,UN-realistic - No character developement.,"I had a few issues with this book.First: Pete sits around and worries that he will be caught and dreads over what he has done...FOR 25 YEARS! I think most of us could get over something after that long. It seemed like, when I was reading the last part of this book, the character Pete was still a child, not an adult. The character NEVER grew up. He stayed a child. Now I dont know about you, but I like it when my character grows and becomes more than he was in the beginning.Second: If you or I had that much money, (darn near a trillion bucks) in the bank, and we were worried about someone finding out about something we'd done in the past...we would purchase an island somewhere in the middle of the atlantic and live there! No truth machines! No nothing but bliss! You could run your company from the comforts of your home by vid screens and have all your supplies flown in! Come on James! think about it!"
3,Thought-provoking and worth reading,"This book has interesting implications, provokes thought on the part of readers and urges us to consider where the human race is headed. However, some aspects of the story are a bit contrived and lack detail. It's definitely worth reading, though."
4,"Good read, but nothing more","I bought this book on the strength of the reviews it had received and was intrigued by THE IDEA.But that's about as far as it goes. I'll grant Mr. Halperin that he had a great IDEA, but it just goes downhill from there. Combine 'Ender's Game', 'The Demolished Man' and one of the many biographies of Bill Gates with the IDEA and you have the 'Truth Machine', albeit badly written. Perhaps the whole story would have been better served in a comic book format.True, it was highly entertaining and I read it in one sitting, and I'll grant that Mr. Halperin is a good storyteller, but a good writer he is not. I cannot help but marvel at all the people in this review section who compare this book to '1984' or even deem it a cult classic of sorts.Read it for good entertainment and to while away the hours, but shelve it with the Ludlums, Crichtons and Grishams, not with your valued Simmons', Ellisons, Heinleins or Le Guins."
3,"""Two strikes and you're executed."" Very nice.","Possibly interesting premise but poorly executed. Halperin fancies himself a futurist and this book is his vision of the future (there's a lot more than just a Truth Machine in it.) The only thing I liked about this book was the ""Swift and Sure"" crime bill. Swift and Sure could also be called ""Two strikes and you're executed."" Very nice. In the book they rationalize that the codex we currently live by: ""better that 10 criminals should go free, rather than one innocent man be punished"" does not account for all the innocent people punished (killed, maimed, whatever) by the 10 criminals who went free. Crime drops precipitously."
4,"Very intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking",Halperin does an excellent job of writing from the perspective of thefuture and he brings his characters to life. I was engrossed with thebook right from the start.
5,I'm a believer.,"*Oh captain, my captain.* (couldn't resist!) A wonderful book. Couldn't put it down.I especially enjoyed the news capsules at the start of each chapter. By givingexamples of the kinds of things that 'happened' in the future, Halperin underscoredthe need for this type of machine. The basic premise that once we get to the pointwhere a single person has the ability to destroy mankind, the human race is injeopardy is a sound one. I'm looking forward to more from Halperin."
5,"At last, a novel that gives us hope for the future","I've been an avid reader my entire life (since about two). I loved this book. At last, aspeculative story that gives us some hope for the future, demonstrating how we might""get there from here."" I liked it so much that I gave copies as Christmas presents to allmy closest friends."
5,Fascinating,"I REALLY like the future predictions at the beginning ofeach chapter. It gets my mind thinking, regardless ofwhether or not I agree with all of the projections. Theexplanations seem scientific. Is there a basis for these,or did the author just invent them? If they are real theories,where can we (the readers) find more info on all of them?The story is interesting, fun to read. Onecan never guess the finer details. I found it easy to readand could not put it down once I started."
3,Not what I expected,"The Truth Machine was good, but I expected much more. I purchased this book based on the customer reviews and was a little dissapointed. I guess my expectations were too high. The story was well written, but a little simplistic. The characters were kind of weak and the plot a little unbelievable. I read the book during my vacation and although I wasn't quite moved, it was a fun read."
1,"Trite, pedantic pablum","<<Gag!>> Do you like books where the male protaganist always has ""Steely, gray penetrating eyes""? and the ""brilliant lady scientist"" who comes to adore him faints at the thought of a nuclear reactor (""Oh, horrors!"") and GIGGLES repeatedly? Well, if you don't mind the pretentious and stultifying lectures on sociology, this one's for you. It wasn't for me."
1,A bizarre bipolar future.,"The Truth Machine is an interesting premise, but the future world depicted is a bizarre mishmash of extreme right-wing philosophy (Sure and Swift - Two strikes and you're dead) and hokey extreme left-wing politics (The Truth Machine itself and the World Government). The book is entertaining with some of the ideas it promotes, but the characters lack any sembalance of being real people. They are poor charactures at best. Many questions go unanswered in this Not-So-Brave New World. I would have prefered reading more about the people who fought against this invasive technology or as one reviewer mentioned, the development of counter-technology. ...."
1,TERRIBLE and thats the TRUTH!!!!!,"Shallow, simple and silly. Gives good sci-fi a bad name. Characters are not just 2 dimensional, they are 1 dimensional, like stick figures. The main characters are ALL noble, super-successful geniuses, with selfless ambitions to save the world. (The also are great looking, popular and have great complexions). Plot dimensions are few and far between. All of the world's present and future problems fade away due to the pervasive effects of insanely great software running on the next generation of Wintel computers. Of course Bill Gates' alter ego saves the world and becomes super-duper rich and famous. We selected this book for our book group based on Amazon Raves. Oops! Maybe this should have been published by Marvel as a comic book."
1,Waste of Paper,"This is simply one of the worst books I have EVER read. Every character is one dimensional, every development is implausable. I won't be purchasing anything else by Mr Halperin, I can't remember ever having been this disappointed by a book."
1,Awful,"Truly awful writing, one dimensional characters, and a childish view of social consequences if the book's premise ever came to be.I bought this based on Amazon reader reviews; either these people read another book or the author has many loyal friends and family members.Avoid this book; read ""1984"" instead for a dystopian view of the future."
3,Void,"What could have been a great, great book ended up as a major dissapointment. The concept that Halperin explores is quite interesting -- that of a truth machine that binds everybody to not lie -- but, as other reviewers have stated, the environment he creates around that concept seems unrealistic and bland at best.None of the characters are really likeable, and what may be worse, none are hateable either, so they never really catch your interest.At the end I was left with a void, as if of a promise unfulfilled..."
4,Interesting. But only interesting.,"People claim that this book is incredibly prophetic. I dunno, perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't, but I do think that this book places much more faith in mankind when placed in the ""truth machine"" situation than I would.But the point of a fiction book is not to tell the future, or be 100 percent factual. That is why it is called fiction.Look past all of that, and you've got yourself an interesting book. The notion of a truth machine is a tantalizing one, and that's what drew me to the book, the title. As it turns out, Halperin does a better than decent job at tackling the issue, with interesting characters, and a story line that will keep you reading. I guess I just think you could get more out of this topic. Maybe not.Anyway, this is an overly decent book, and I do recommend reading it."
5,The Truth Machine is a worthwhile read,"I read this when it first came out - what? 15 years ago? Wow! So I was 25. Terrific book. Entertaining and thought provoking. I've seen reviews that are less than favorable. To them I would say: ""you're looking for too much meaning"". Read it. Don't over analyze it or pick it apart. Just enjoy. Lost my hardbound copy by lending it out. I imagine it is well travelled by now - at least I sure hope so. I recommended The Truth Machine to a friend just a few weeks ago and just learned that it will be going to the big screen via Lion's Gate. I think it will translate well."
2,"Interesting vision, poor execution","Blatantly optimistic view of the future, with wooden prose and 2-dimensional characters. The part about a computer narrator was a pure cop out to cover the fact that the author can't write with any style or emotion.I can't understand why everyone's raving about this: maybe the ultra-rosy future depicted soothes people's concerns for what will come.3 points for an interesting view of what could happen should a Truth Machine be built, but even that view falls short. Would everyone give away all privacy so willingly? Wouldn't various politicians, world leaders, and crime figures do anything in their power to stop it? Wouldn't these scenarios have made a much more interesting novel?"
2,Good plot idea. Muddled execution.,"The idea is great but the author spends most of his time pushing his own technological agenda. He never digs into the implications of the ""truth machine"" on indiviuals in our society."
2,"Great premise, poor execution","I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a high school creative writing project can get suchgreat reviews, based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so. Yes, the Truth Machine isa great idea. Yes, it would change the world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates. But,this work of ""speculative fiction"" falls a bit short of impressive on the storytelling front. Thecharacters are one-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and the dialogue wooden. As apremise for a story, it's great: recommended. As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Painful, Painful, Painful","I had to WORK to finish this collection of drivel. I am stunned by some of the reviews in light of my personal experience but suspect they are not coming from true Science Fiction afficiendos. As Robert Blake should have been singing to himself when he left the restaurant, ""Don't do it!"""
2,Great concept - terrible writing,"This book suffers from the same ills that strike many ""Sci-Fi"" writings. A fascinating idea encapsulated in terrible writing, stereotyped characters, and non-sensical plot twists. Read it if you have an interest in ""futurism"" just try to choke down the style."
2,deja vu,"I thought this book was a very good read but I was astonished to find that it was so incredibly close in theme and content to a book I read a few years ago. ""The Lidek Revolution,"" by James Stark was written five years prior to ""The Truth Machine."" It was a bit repetative considering Stark's book was so good."
2,"Great premise, poor execution","I don't get it. Is it true that a book written like a highschool creative writing project can get such great reviews,based only on its thought-provoking premise? It seems so.Yes, the Truth Machine is a great idea. Yes, it would changethe world, perhaps even more than Mr. Halperin postulates.But, this work of ""speculative fiction"" falls a bit short ofimpressive on the storytelling front. The characters areone-dimensional, the plot contrived and predictable, and thedialogue wooden.As a premise for a story, it's great: recommended.As a story: read Heinlein. You won't be disappointed."
3,What if no one could get away with lying?,"The intriguing and disturbingly plausible thesis of this book is that humanity is likely to self-destruct in the not-too-distant future if someone doesn't invent a ""truth machine,"" that is, a 100% reliable lie detector.I was hoping and expecting that the book would focus on imagining in detail the ramifications of this invention on specific individuals and social institutions. But instead, that was more the background to the story, which focuses on the life of the inventor of the truth machine--from a childhood trauma, through his undergraduate years at Harvard and his vision of the truth machine, through the development and worldwide use of the truth machine."
4,Original theme,"Altough the storyline itself is not very sophistocated, it is based on a very interesting and new idea: The development of a machine that can perfectly detect lies. What would the implications be for our lives and can we indeed hope to survive without it?"
2,I really tried to like this book...,"After reading all the great reviews this book received here at Amazon, I was disappointed to find that The Truth Machine utterly failed to live up to its acclaim. I don't deny that it was interesting (I, too, didn't put the book down until I had finished it), but comparisons to 1984 and Brave New World are a far stretch, if one can even make them at all. Halperin's vision of the future is indeed imaginative and thought-provoking, but these good points are lost in the shoddy writing and poor characterization. Even minimal attention to Randall, David, and Diana would have made this novel infinitely more enjoyable."
2,"Great concept, poor execution.","I bought the book because I was intrigued by the concept, and unfortunately, all I got was concept. The book was ostnsibly written by a computer as a disinterested 3rd party and that's how I felt most of the time, like a disinterested 3rd party. My time would have been better spent discussing the concept with friends rather than reading the book."
1,Over hyped and boring,"I found this book to be very boring and the characters to be cardboard cutouts. The book doesn't deal with the implications of what might really happen with a truth machine. Instead the author glosses over a lot of repercussions and justs pushes the ""god of science"". This is lame pop-fiction."
1,Hook the author to the Truth Machine,"This book is crap! Great premise, but there's more characterization in a Nancy Drew mystery. The plot clunks along ridiculously (""Mr. President, I want to build a Truth Machine. It will take 20 years and cost 300 billion dollars.""""Okay, here's your money. "" I've seen better writing in a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Skip it."
5,A fascinating glimpse at the next century!,"Being a long time computer scientist, ""The Truth Machine"" appealed to meon many levels. I had to remind myself that I was not reading a non-fiction history book. The topic, writing styleand attention to detail caused me to stay awake all night and finish in one sitting."
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","The first half of the book is not bad. It starts out being fairly realistic. But the second half is increasingly unbelievable. The author sets up a technological utopia where poverty, disease, hunger, crime, and all other societal ills are nearly eliminated. The result is simply not credible. An external device like the truth machine does not necessarily provide a disincentive for criminal behavior. And far too many minor details are far too implausible (the elimination of paper books, underground subways traveling at Mach 3, and a couple that has sex at least once a day for two years straight). Sorry, but the author's imagination got a little carried away here."
5,A stimulating and gratifying experience!,Is a truth machine really feasible? It really would change the world! The Truth Machine offers hope to a world where people often don't see alternatives or options. But this book mostly made me think that if all people valued truth & honest intercourse we wouldn't have to wait for Pete Armstrong.
2,I found it to be too long by about 300 pages,"I read both this novel and The First Immortal because a friend highly recommended them. What a bore...First of all, I give this two stars instead of one star because, at least apparently, it is accurate from a scientific and factual perspective.Truth be told, Halperin is not a novelist. He is an extremely accomplished amateur futurist.This novel, like The First Immortal, has very interesting concepts. Concepts that could have been explained in a very compelling 150-page novel. Instead Halperin takes us on a journey of self indulgent ""gee, this is how smart I am"", which would be ok if he could write without using endless clich&#65533;s, unbelievably shallow characters and excruciatingly boring story lines. What's so frustrating is that now and again he just about ""get's it"" and then returns to lecturing the reader."
1,Not Impressed...,"I'm always wary of people who wish to save the world. There was more than fiction at work here, I really got the impression that the author thought that a truth machine was a valid and necessary invention to save the human race. Typical paranoid American garbage. In James Halperin's future the rest of the world are fighting and causing problems, while the brave American heros are busy trying to save us. Sigh... Only some Republican-voting, bubble-dwelling moron could come up with these futuristic predictions. The people of Cuba vote to become an American state? The American people are the most educated and literate in the world? An Irish terrorist group blows up the channel tunnel? Give me a f***ing break. There were many more equally silly scenarios, but I can't remember them, as I tossed ""The Truth Machine"" into the Amazon river after I had finished reading it. This book bites."
5,Surprising & Fascinating,"Chapter heads seemed ripped from a future world almanac. The 22g CP, the non-sentient, has a personality that ranks up there with Kubrick's Hal and Heinlein's Mike (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress). It is always, always refreshing to read science fiction that is plot-driven, character-driven and speculation-driven, and does not rely on pyrotechnics or pure fantasy."
5,"Great, thought-provoking novel","My ex-girlfriend suggested The Truth Machine to me. I am sure she ment it as a slight but then I happened to see it and picked it up, and I am glad she said that. I don't believe I have ever felt more empathy for a literary character than I did for Petey. As far as relationships are concerned, hey, take the thought of whether or not you can trust a person out of the equation. Wouldn't it be nice to scip the salesman the next time you get a new car? However some questions should never be scipped; Do you think these jeans make me look fat? Who do you think is a better cook me or your mother? Perhaps a white-lie tolerance should be allowed. Or hopefully people will learn not to ask those kinds of questions."
1,I couln't finish it,"After reading 22% of the book, the concept of the truth machine was just beginning to be explored. The long painful windup to that moment involves some of the dullest characters I have ever met in a book. I cared about them about as much as I would care about chess pieces in a game I am not playing. I really had high hopes for this book. I think that it is an excellent concept for a novel, and one that someday might play out in reality. But I wanted to claw my eyes out from reading all the tedium. The story, to the extent one might exist here, is stitched together with various news accounts and meaningless commentaries on society and technology. I quit. There might be a good idea deeper in, but I refuse to dig any deeper to find it. Real news tells better stories."
1,Author lacks the ability to write a compelling sentence.,"I admit, I could not make it past the second chapter of this book. After that, I threw it into the garbage. The ideas in the story may be excellent, I am not sure, and I really don't care. The problem I had with this book was the ugliness of the language, and the outrageous hyperbole. Everyone in the book is ""the richest man in the world"" or ""seven standard deviations to the left of the median in intelligence."" The man who wrote it may have some ability as a storyteller, but he has no ability whatsoever as a writer. The sentences were cumbersome and stiff. I felt like I was reading an outline of a story written for a high school creative writing class, not an actual polished novel.Maybe the ideas are interesting, but if you love the English language at all, you will absolutely hate this book."
2,"Droning, unbelievable, and painfully annoying","This book drones on for a terrible tale of the life of a superman. It's about the world's greatest genius who comes along and saves all of us idiots from destroying ourselves. It is the story was an angel of a man in public and private, save for one incident. The incident - murder - which is attributed to saving millions of lives, so even when he's bad he's good! No, a horrible book that annoys more than anything. However, a very creative look at the future, and a great book - for a first time author."
2,"Interesting premise, but fails to deliver","Instead of developing the main premise, that of a society governed by a truth machine and its consequences, the author chose to focus on the personal life of his main character. Unfortunately, the personality of the scientist never progresses beyond that of the 5 year old, leaving the reader with a flat one-dimensional character."
2,If only his writing were up to his ideas.,"I was greatly interested in the premise of this book and eagerly picked it up. What I found was a novel that never developed much past the inital theme. In many ways, it is more annoying to find a great idea executed poorly than a overall bad book, because you can see what a better author could have done. Instead of a interesting comentary on a true society, the book myoptically contentrates on it's main charecters, the Good Scientist, the Bad Scienist and all the other cardboard cutout people Sci-Fi is known for. If the actions of these people seemed at all likely or logical it might still be fun, but they make desicions only because that is how the author wants the plot to go. Additonally, the ""Computer writing a book"" concept is fun to begin with, but gets old. The author drops in and out of his computer personal randomly and it just ends up annoying."
2,Truth is One-Dimensional???,"A fascinating concept. However, while the author presents his ideas and storyline competently and cohesively, he really neglects his characters. The characters are so one-dimensional, perfect and boring -- all smart, pretty, nice, ethical, etc. -- that by the end you're practically forced to root for the villain... but he's pretty boring, too. Worse, the author chooses to view truth itself in a one-dimensional light. Granted, the truth machine here is basically a more reliable poylgraph test, but the fundamental, existential question of ""What really defines the truth?"" is barely skimmed here. Geared mainly for the male adolescent crowd."
5,The previous reviewer must have read a different book.,"All characters seemed human. Both sides of many conflicts were given rational arguments. The book encouraged thought and discussion beyond the plot and characters. The only things I didn't like about The Truth Machine was that I got nothing else done all weekend, and it ended"
5,This book really gets your mind wandering!!,This is an incredible book that makes the reader think about the possibilities for the future. What would our world be like without crime? Can we ever really require a license for parenting? A truly incredible book that is written very well
5,Phenomenal! Best sci-fi book of the year.,"A riveting story, and very very original. Tons of interesting ideas, and characters you really believe in. I couldn't put it down. I've never done an Amazon.com book review, but I just had to for this one. The best that hard sci-fi gets!"
3,"All right, but . . .","I enjoyed this, but I'm still reeling from another truly great book I just finished which may be tempering my perspectives here. Halperin's is a good premise and fairly well executed, but it pales in comparison to Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. If you're looking for a truly mind-boggling story, pick up this book. After three weeks, I still can't get it out of my mind."
4,Proprietary labels,"This product appears to work well, and P-touch editor, which came free with the printer, is an easily accessible and understandable program used in conjunction with the printer. The issue I have, however, is that it requires proprietary labels made by Brother, and will not accept any other labels. This in particular was an issue for me, as the company I work for requires pre-printed labels (in color). Brother does not pre-print labels, and this is not a color label printer. For the price, it seems to be an excellent machine, and so long as you do not need pre-printed labels or, of course, color, and don't mind purchasing labels solely from Brother, than this printer (which is the cheapest label printer I could find that was capable of printing on 4"" wide labels) will likely be all you need."
4,Well Worth Listening To,"Hendrik Meurkens has been a leader in the European Jazz harmonica scene since the late 1980's, second only to the great Toots Thielemans. In fact, Meurkens took up the harmonica after hearing Thielemans. After studying at the Berklee School of Music, Meurkens delved deeply into Brazilian Jazz as his major style.This CD is a departure, playing simplified arrangements of a few jazz standards as well as two original Meurkens compositions. The playing is straight-forward and though listeners will definitely hear the Thielemans influence, Meurkens definitely adds his own voice to the sound.If you're interested in Jazz harmonica, please take the time to give this recording a listen."
4,This is the brake fix hot list you will want when you don't have your WAN because your Cisco is unhappy.,What it lacks in detail it makes up for in direction. It helped me fix my router after failure of its flash.
4,A great book,"This is a great book. I wish I had this book when I was just starting to learn the Cisco CLI. This book includes all kinds of Cisco and networking related know how. Like how-to pick an isp, find a host on the network (down to the switchport), and how to make your router/switch secure with ssh. My only wish would be for another book from Lucas called Cisco Switches for the desperate. This book is an excellent value, and an easy read. Michael Lucas keeps this book interesting. Other BOOKS in this industry could learn a few things from Cisco Routers for the Desperate 2nd edition."
2,I'd pass on this one,"If you're a western tourist, who's never read anything about Shinto, you might be able to get something out of this book. Anyone with a little knowledge of the spiritual practice should probably pass on this one. It's too condensed to really discuss the topic in anything more than a superficial way. It has some pretty pictures, but they do little to illustrate anything being discussed.I also felt it suffered from being written by someone who was clearly from the West and seemed to be struggling to interpret it too much through the viewpoint of our own value systems and philosophy, rather than on it's own terms. If he'd used the terms ""ambiguity tolerance"" or ""contradictory"" as a shorthand way of describing Shinto one more time, I think I'd have chucked the book in the waste bin."
2,A pretty LITTLE book,"This is a pretty little book which might be suitable if you know nothing whatsoever about shinto, and wish to learn a little about Japan's indigenous religion. It is attractive, quickly read, and not too desert-religion biased.I you already know anything at all about shinto, or if you are interested in the faith and wish to get a good and full introduction to it, this is definitely not the book for you. It is much too superficial in its scope for that, and its outlook is much too westernized.Casual tourist? By all means. Nipponophile? Stay away!"
3,Not to Be Taken Too Literally,"Shinto is a religion that is never the same way depending on who one asks. One could get thousands of responses, all different, from Shintoists all over. This book may seem like the foundation for Shinto, but Shinto is a religion that really was never founded in the first place, and it cannot be condenced into such a small book. To accurately put Shinto to words would take many volumes of literature."
4,Good pouch for the money,I bought this pouch even though many people say its bad. I've had over a month now with this pouch and it is working great very thin and not bulky whatsoever. It works great with the Samsung Blade AKA A900
3,Razor case,"The product does not look like the pic at all. It is all black (in and out) No ""beige"" leather as it shows in the pic. The shipment took longer than expected. I have been using it for 6 weeks and so far so good. No problems with clip or magnetic locker."
2,worth the money,"I got this for about $6 shipped for my husbands new phone. He might be a little rough with his phones but he's never broken a cell phone case before. The clip started falling off within a month, which made it useless to him. The magnetic flap that surrounds the phone is still holding up, so if all you need it to do is protect your phone you'll be fine."
1,false,my coment is what you see in this picture fame is not what you get in the mail whats up with that.
1,short lived,Pouch worked well except the connection were the clip attaches the material started to tear and became useless.
2,You get what you pay for,"FYI, you get what you pay for. The picture looks a lot better than what it really is. You may be better off getting something local for $5 at some flee market or outlet store."
5,This is FAR better than I was expecting for the price!,"This product is worth much more than they are charging. It's good-looking, it's solidly-constructed, it's super-comfortable, it's easy to retrieve the phone quickly, and it hangs on my belt so well that I don't even take it off when I ride my motorcycle. It also fits my Razr v3 perfectly."
4,sometimes difficult to remove from pouch,"This is inexpensive and well made but the draw back is getting it out of the pouch. I've had to push up on my razor and sometimes I may push on a button that will end the call. OPPS. Other than that, If your fingers aren't as large as mine it would be great."
2,not working case,"I bought it and it did not fit my phone. the seller did not tell the length, width of product. my phone is bigger than that. that case looks good but it does not fit.I trashed it after I receive it. couldn't send it back because return back not accepted"
2,"NICE LITLLE CASE, WORTH FOR THE MONEY","THIS IS NICE LITTLE CASE, VERY LIGHT, GOOD LOOKING. ONLY PROBLEM SO FAR IS THE CLIP. THE LEATHER SURROUNDING THE CLIP CAME OFF WITH ONE WEEK'S OF USE. OFCOURSE IT IS NOT MADE OF GOOD QUALITY LEATHER, AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T EVEN THINK ITS LEATHER. ITS SHIPPING COST LITTLE HIGH WILL SUM YOU UP TO $ 8AJ"
1,Item Not as Listed - Do not Buy,"I ordered this product previously from this seller and I liked it. After about a year of use, it was starting to show wear. I ordered a replacement and it is not as listed. The item pictured is not what you receive. The cut outs for your charger, etc. are not in the places as shown in the picture...the one shipped is not even the CELLET brand as it had been previously. Further, the seller offers a 'Hassle-Free Returns Policy' as long as the item is defective. I suggest you look for the same item from another seller."
5,High quality and fits D807 well,"I was surprised of the high quality of the item. Good magnet, a bit bulky, but fits well on my belt."
2,"Great Transaction, Poor Product","I have no beef with the seller as far as their speed and ease of transaction. They were easy to deal with and shipped fast - VERY professional. The problem was with this leather pouch itself. I realize that it was cheap, but that's the point of Amazon - deals. This was no deal. The backing started tearing after only a couple weeks, and within a few weeks after that, the case is completely useless as it's torn from top to bottom. I would recommend this seller for OTHER products, but this product was pretty low quality."
5,"Fascinating, insightful book!","This is one of the only books on Japanese culture that was written in such a fashion that I couldn't put it down. It covered a variety of topics I hadn't even thought to ask, and didn't address things like ""Japanese people bow because it's polite"", but ""Japanese people bow because it's polite, this is why it's polite, it relates to their early culture because of this, and here are some examples of conditioning as it relates to the bow, etc etc"". It's very well written, very interesting, and eye-opening to the westerner. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a genuine interest in Japanese culture that goes beyond anime, and would DEFINITELY recommend it to those pursuing Japanese and Asian studies in college."
4,Ken Burns on a forgotten superstar athlete,"The life of a superstar athlete is almost always tragic - the fame and money inevitably cause a lot of disharmony in one's life. In Ken Burn's telling of the Jack Johnson story, we also see that rampant race discrimination adds to Jack Johnson's woes as a superstar athlete. Jack Johnson is a heavyweight boxer in the early 1900s who amazingly breaks the color barrier and wins the crown. Fame, money, women and persecution follow. The story is pretty good. You get to see the many facets of Jack Johnson: the good (unwilling to bend to social race pressure, talented fighter) and the bad (the womanizing, the recklessness, the hypocrisy (he wouldn't fight other blacks after winning the title)). It is a little bit dragged out I think - at 4 hours, I think the story could have been well told in 2. But it is an interesting look back at professional boxing in the early 1900s and race attitudes that prevailed back then."
4,Forgiveable Blackness,"A fascinating documentary. Get people like James Earl Jones commenting on Jack's life. The history of his life and the issues around the times are also fascinating, the lynchings, the media, the politics - seems sad that we have progressed so little in the near century it's been since Jack won the title a few blocks from my place. Can't rate this documentary highly enough. You don't have to be a boxing fanatic or even American to enjoy it."
2,Guilty White Liberal Burns can't focus on reality,"Once again Ken Burns focuses on racism when in reality, more people probably hated Johnson because of his personality (read arrogance, impertinance and cockiness) that would have angered people if he was whiteYes there was racism, but Johnson's crime was marrying a white women, when at those times Jews married Jews, Italians married Italians, Lutherians married Lutherians, Chinese married Chinese etc.This was similar to Burns in ""baseball"" about Ty Cobb, when in Cobb's day, it was more of a crime to be an atheist than a racist, and for Jackie Robinson, when it was just as much about job security that Blacks would take jobs from WhitesIt no different than the harrassment men get for keeping their hair long in the 60's.The guilty white political correctness of Burns can't focus on the reality of the past and ruins the truth being told"
5,unforgettable and smooth,The video describes jack johnson from his days of poverty to his rise to fame. It also looks at the prejudice that roared back in the 1900's. This is a great story not only about jack johnson life but also about the american living and influences in those segregated times.
5,a history lesson required to appreciate our recent past,"I have studied the boxing profession and appreciate Mr Johnson's skill in the ring; however, his strength as a human being transcends even his boxing prowess. Easy to see how Ali drew parallels to his own quest for a place in history. Watch this film and learn about the history of boxing and American attitudes to anything or anyone different."
2,Not what I'd expected,"I wouldn't buy it. The material is very introductory, as in high school physics introductory. Despite what the title implied, it has very little information on Infrared Systems. Spend a bit more and get something else. Should have known from the price that it was too good to be true. If you really want it, contact me and I'll give it to you cheap. Just got it for a few days only."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I was looking for a hat for a costume, one that would fit over a wig and maintain its shape, and when I saw this online, I was a bit hesitant because I knew I wouldn't be able to try it on. Fortunately, it was perfect. It fit comfortably over my wigged head without feeling tight, and it maintained its shape perfectly while doing so. The only downside is, it's way to big for my head without the wig! As a side note, I do have a small head. Like... I wear children's glasses small. So if you consider yourself to have an average to large sized head, I think this will fit you just fine, and if you have a small sized head, it looks great over wigs!"
5,Indispensable cap,"I've ordered several of these hats, and they are roomy, comfortable, durable and stylish, and the price is a bargain. I only wish they were offered in a wider array of colors."
5,Works perfectly in dog crate,"I got this to go in my dogs soft sided dog crate, the kind of crate with the inner steel frame. I used the velcro clip that comes with the dog crate and attaches to the frame and then clipped it to the handle of this bucket and it stays upright with no spilling."
2,Horrible product,"I bought this less than a week ago. I've tried to use it twice now, and both times it failed. The needle gets clogged with the smallest spices and to get it cleaned out is a royal pain. I even got my hubby involved with it. It will squirk water just fine, but try to use a thicker liquid (A1 sauce, bottle maranaides, etc.) and it gets clogged up. After a miserable experience with it tonight, I tossed it in the sink so I could wash it. Once I got over the the sink a few minutes later I discovered the needle broke - not just a little bent, it actually snapped off. Keep in mind, I tossed this into the sink - I didn't throw it across the room, I just kinda dropped it in. I thought I might try to get a replacement needle (maybe the one I got was defective) but I've done a couple searches for them now on-line and I can only find places to buy the whole item. Don't waist your money on this, it didn't survive two uses."
2,Looks nicer in the photo,"I was excited to receive this robe, but disappointed in it, as it doesn't look as nice in person. It's only available in one-size, so you need to be fairly thin, maybe a 10 or under for it to fit comfortably. I don't know if the pattern differs from garment to garment, but mine isn't that attractive."
3,"Convenient, but expensive","The first papertray sent didn't work. I called HP (maybe I should have called Amazon) and they eventually sent another one (they really wanted to know if my printer was in warantee, which isn't what didn't work).HP sent a new one in about 10 days and it worked fine.The cost is high, but it now works perfectly giving me a legal size option. I wish it was 500 sheets so it would take full rheem of paper."
3,Thorn birds,"It certainly has all the songs in the show, but if you're looking for the theme song you are better off buying that separately ."
4,Thorn Birds Beautiful Soundtrack,"Really limited to variations on a few tunes, but it is beautiful music, & brings back beautiful memories of the mini series. It's great music for a quiet dinner, or to de-stress & relax to. Beautiful Mancini music."
1,THE DULCIMER IS STILL NOT THERE!!!,"The unhappy reviewer who returned 3 copies is absolutely correct. This is an incomplete recording. The dulcimer is missing from the Main Title, & according to Varese Sarabande, it's going to continue missing since Varese has NO plans to fix their own major blunder!! Varese blew it & now won't correct the problem. Too bad. They used to be a worthwhile label."
4,It works for 50+ women,"If you are older and have the sheer will to stick to an eating plan, choose this one. I thought I'd never be able to lose weight again, but as tough as this diet is, it got results right away and--although I was totally skeptical--it does stop your cravings for sugar and salty snacks. I don't claim to understand how, even after reading the book twice. I'm guessing it has something to do with flax seed oil. And the food sensitivies the book refers to really do show up. You learn by experience which foods will give you bloat, gas and make you sleepy. Best for me besides the 5 pounds lost in 5 weeks (I had 20 exremely stubborn pounds to lose)was I have stopped retaining water which you can see in my ankles and hands. I'm being honest when I say I will probably follow this healthy plan for life. (The book needs a better index. You refer to it several times a day if you're like me.) I am going to get the recipe book now."
5,Still size 8,"The Fat Flush Plan is the best diet I have ever tried. I lost 28 pounds and went from a size 12 to a size 8 in a few months. Phase 1 is the secret. Curbs those carb cravings and it's a fabulous tool if you stray. It's always there to fall back on even for just a few days to get you back on track.There are also health benefits. My total cholesterol went from 195 to 173 with the bad cholesterol lower and the good higher and my tryglicerides went from 105 to 43. It has been almost 2 years and everything still fits. Love the Fat Flush.Adrienne SilvesterConcord, CA"
5,Great Book - Easy to follow!,"Ann Louise Gittleman explains WHY her plan works, and makes it extremely easy to follow. I feel better, have more energy, and yes, the fat really does come off quickly.Well-written and well-explained, I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of diets that are impossible to follow or maintain."
2,Way Too Much Fluids,"On the one hand, if you can figure out a way to drink all the fluids on this diet, I'll bet that you loose weight. On the other hand, you won't be able to leave your house because you have to pee constantly because of the volume of fluids! This is essentially a strictly low carb diet, with portion control. Anyone who is able to stay on it will loose weight. I couldn't do it."
2,Flush is in the title for a good reason!,"A good friend wanted a ""buddy"" with whom to follow this plan. Essentially the first drink of the day--water with psyllium is also the last drink of the day. Does the word laxative mean anything? After one week I have not lost any weight, but the texture of my skin has changed to the point where others have commented on my appearance. I'll give it one more week and then back to Weight Watchers. Unless the weight starts coming off. Not only are the supplements expensive, but of dubious benefit and possibly noxious for anyone with allergies."
3,not what it seems,"I did what this book said to do, which is eating more protein than I am used to. As it turns out, it is easy to follow but I gained 4 pounds in the first week. I stuck with it and the second week I gained two more. I was doing exactly what the book said. After two weeks, I kept some of the ideas and cut back on my protein intake and lost the 6 pounds I gained."
3,Not much for a vegetarian,"This book is well written but for a Vegetarian it simple won't work as far as the menu's are concerned. You are allowed eggs for instance but no yolk. Apparently you can make a omelete with egg whites ! yuck.The menu's aimed at meat eaters leaving some valuable sources of protein on the do not eat list which vegetarians would normally eat for the meat substitute. No potatoes, no bread, no pasta and I think also no lentils/beans - etc... needless to say I was VERY hungry on this diet."
3,"informative, helpful, but hard to follow","i enjoyed reading this book - learning more about liver function, and how toxins in my diet can affect all bodily functions was enlightening. i view food differently now, so i'm glad i read the book.however, the first phase of the diet is very difficult to follow, because you are basically only allowed protein, vegetables and limited fruit. the author also recommends a variety of oils, supplements and special mini-trampoline exercises that are a pricey investment. you should be able to lose weight eating normal food and with normal exercise, which is why i won't be continuing on this diet.this diet did get more vegetables in my diet, and helped me to realize how dependent on carbs, sugar and fast food i am. i will continue to limit white carbs/sugar, and eliminate toxic fast foods."
5,Healthy Way of Life,"I started the Fat Flush Plan earlier this year with great results thus far. This is a very different plan from any that I have tried. The book is well planned out explaining all the why's and how's behind the theories and is a real eye-opener about all the toxins is our foods. It is a very clean, simple plan with some very specific foods, oils & herbs to be used throughout the different phases.It works wonders, however not the simpliest of plans but in my opinion, the best type of plan for anyone looking to lose weight, eat healthy, anyone with medical conditions."
4,Thoroughly researched,"Gittleman has done the world a huge favor by stressing the importance of detoxification in order not only to lose weight, but also to have health in general. This is something raw foodists have known for a century. Unfortunately, she doesn't go into cooked food as a source of additional toxins. Nonetheless she has done her homework in finding all kinds of tips for detox, such as herbs and lemon juice.I got lots of weight loss nuggets from this book, and various insights that helped me shed 20 pounds. (This is one of a dozen or so books I used for research.) I was astounded to discover that flaxseeds can be toxic if you eat over 4 T a day (not true for flax oils)! That information alone was worth the price of the book! That pearl of advice alone has changed some of my food staples."
5,Not Just Another Diet Book,"The Fat Flush Plan is a practical approach to wellness along with a weight reduction program. Gittleman addresses the body's reponse to toxicity associated with chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and environmental components and offers a common sense approach to detoxification. This is not a 'theory' book, rather it is one that gives the reader essential information about wellness, nutrition and lifelong healthy eating. Moreoever, it provides a program that is uniquely staged to customize to reader's needs. The Fat Flush Plan was developed with real people and real life experiences in mind. Whether you are interested in just learning how to better care for your body, or lose weight, or develop a lifelong healthy eating plan, The Fat Flush Plan can provide it all."
4,It's working,Thought this would be difficult to follow and required breaking some bad habits; daily cocktail(s) and starches..but it's not. I always feel full and don't miss the bad carbs.I have an occasional glass of wine and still have a small am't of coffee in the AM..but otherwise follow this program..Down 13 lbs in 4 weeks. My friend lost 20 lbs in 8 weeks. I'm hooked.
5,Fat flush plan,"The book is great to help you adjust your eating habits to a healthy diet. It helps with a life change. Results are valid. This is not for the person who only wants to play with a diet, but is for those who want and need a life change in health and living. We also have the cookbook and fitness plan."
2,A Difficult Read,"While I got some great advice and tips from this book, I found it a rather difficult read. It is not well-organized and I spent a lot of time highlighting and book marking so I could find the information again. The premise is to detoxify your liver and the diet itself is basically a low-carb diet (lean protein) with a restriction on salt and dairy. Quite a few supplements are recommended. I liked the emphasis on organic foods and the clorox bath alternative. She also wants you to increase your water and fiber intake which are both important anyway. I have been able to incorporate many of her ideas but I found following the diet pretty difficult without becoming monotonous. But then, I'm not much of an inspired cook or shopper. Perhaps someone with more time and daring would do better."
2,Not working,"The book gave a lot of technical knowledge on how the body works. However, the dietary suggestions in the book have taken a toll on my budget. I also purchased the weight loss supplements and they are not working."
4,Excellent plan - loss 32 pounds in 3 months & still losing!,"A friend had recommended detox related books by Ann Louise Gittleman. While researching those, I came across the Fat Flush Plan book. I am very thankful that I did! ALG's explanation of the liver as a fat-burning organ sold me on the plan. I use to eat tons of junk food, pre-packaged conveniencefoods and processed foods like deli meats. In the first two weeks on the plan, I had lost 11 pounds. Now this plan is not for the faint of heart, it requires a change to your way of eating and living; BUT, it is worth it! You are taking supplements to improve your overall health and help out your liver. You're getting the poisons and toxins out of your system by following this plan; and, your body will thank you for it... I don't hear those strange gurgle noises in my body that were coming from the liver area; plus, I sleep like a baby. Thank you, ALG!!!"
3,I would like to get a mail perspective on the book,"Ann Gittleman was recently on a local radio station here in the bay area and I was intrigued by the book, yet when I read the reviews and the synopsis it seems like it is geared towards women and I wanted to know if there are any male readers that have bought the book and how the plan has worked for them...please feel free to email [E-MAIL ADDRESS]"
2,Obnoxious CD voice,"I was SO looking forward to listening to Fat Flush on CD - but I can't do that. The person who recorded the book did so in such an obnoxious manner that I am TOTALLY turned off to it. I believe that when the book was recorded the volume was set WAY to high because even when I lower the volume it's still ""right in my ear"". (Maybe she was too close to the mic.) Also I didn't purchase the Fat Flush CD to be entertained, I bought it so that I could listen while working, etc. and still get the benefits that I would have from reading the book itself. Money down the drain! VERY disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not for everyone,"I'm sure that this book is well intentioned, but instead of losing, I gained on this plan. I don't know about my cholesterol, but I found this diet way too time consuming for my busy schedule, very expensive and required me to drive 20 miles to get the special foods that were required. In addition, I decided to eat meat while on the first two stages of this diet because it is next to impossible to be a vegetarian and be on this plan. All in all ... this program's not for everyone!"
2,Just Another (now wealthy) Diet Guru?,"First of all, I read this book cover-to-cover. I think ALG talks ""down"" to her readers, and her writing style is full of archaic expressions. Reading this book made me feel like I was being asked to join a religion. I'm all for being healthy, and losing weight, but I don't want to get caught up in another ""just follow me because I'm right (oh, and by the way, I'll make a lot of money if you do)"" effort. Doesn't the zealousness of this regimen make anyone else feel like they're being preached to by a TV evangelist? Every new diet's guru speaks with such authority, but none of them agree entirely. And there are folks out there who dispute what ALG promotes. Just do some research yourself on the net about ""high lignan flaxseed oil"", for one example. And just because something ""works"" for some people (e.g. weight loss), doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy for everyone. This plan is not realistic. It's fanatical."
2,fat flush plan,"I bought the Fat Flush Plan, went out and spent about $150 on the supplements, vegetables, fruits, proteins, and cranberry juice, and now it's been two weeks, and I have to say, I'm disappointed. I wasn't expecting a miracle, but I've only lost 5 pounds, I've been miserable with mood swings and acne problems, and it's actually given me more cramps then before!! I was so upset to see the results. I've switched to another diet, and I feel less sluggish, more alert and energetic, and I can eat more food than before! I'm sorry, but Fat Flush just didn't work for me."
4,Book,This book arrived in a timely manner in very good shape. I would recommend this read to anyone. Very good
3,You better have a lot of time on your hands,"This may be the best diet in the world, but frankly it didn't take long for me to realize how time-consuming it all was. If you don't work and have time to make your breakast and lunch, then go for it. But if eating oatmeal and yogurt at your desk is your thing, forget about it. There are plenty of low-fat, high nutrition ways to lose weight and stay healthy that won't make you feel like you're working in the lab. Making Cran-water for the day ahead? Grinding up flaxseeds? No grains. No dairy. I prefer to go with a healthy well-balanced eating plan WITH exercise to stay fit. Why would anybody brag about never exercising? Eating per this plan is a ridiculous way to live."
4,reviewing a used book order,"The book was advertised as ""like new."" Except for one page, it was ""like new."" I could white out the writing on the one page that had writing. The writing on that one page was easy to overlook in examining the entire book. I believe the merchant honestly thought the book had no marks in it. The few marks I found on a single page does not put me off this merchant. As for the contents of the book, we'll see how effective they are in the next few months."
1,fat flush,I have learned the only way to cleanse your body is to fast for one day. Diets do not work. ONLY WILL POWER.
1,What's so complicated with losing weight?,"Losing weight is extremely simple. Spend more energythan you consume, and the weight will come off.Guaranteed. All it takes is some knowledge, dedicationand discipline. There is no silver bullet, allthese fad diets work to the extent the end resultis a negative difference between energy consumedand energy spent. Get a good calorie guide, eat1200-1500 calories a day of whatever food you wantto eat, exercise for at least 40 minutes 5 times aweek and you will lose weight. If you're not, youare cheating somewhere. There is nothing more to it.If you want to make some people rich by buying thesebooks, by all means do that. It will not change anyof the above."
2,Can Be Discouraging,"This diet has some good points with regard to nutrition and I liked the over all idea. Cranberry juice, flaxseed oil, etc. are all things that you find in my kitchen so I thought...no problem, we can do this. Then I tried to follow the meal plans and pack lunches for my husband and well, I just found how difficult this can be. My husband is so tired of chicken for lunch and by the time he gets home we're both craving crazy-high sugar things that we normally don't. We live a pretty organic and healthy lifestyle, but this diet had us discouraged and frustrated. Going on any diet can be a drag, but I was hoping this wouldn't be that BIG!I am happy that it's worked for some of you! You have a stronger constitution than I do!"
4,Amazing!,"I gained 85 pounds during my pregnancy and only lost half of it before I began the Fat Flush plan. By then my daughter was 20 months. I stayed in Phase 1 for 30 days and lost 15 pounds. I did veer off the plan a few times, but still lost weight. The book recommends that you jump on a mini trampoline for exercise, but I didn't purchase one. Maybe if I did, I would have had better results. My boyfriend did TFFP with me and lost 30 pounds in 30 days! I need to lose 30 more pounds, so I am about to start all over again. I am not gonna jump on a trampoline, but I am going to use my Wii Active. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to lose a lot of weight...fast!"
2,"Catchy Title, but save your money!","This one is gathering dust. I thought it would give my zone diet a little boost. I followed it for over a month, and nothing. I am a stickler at following plans (if I can master the zone I can follow anything).It was too annoying, not satisfying, and highly disappointing.I did, however, get something permanent out of it. I love drinking hot water with lemon.My advice to you - skip this book, but drink the hot water with lemon."
1,diet made me sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this diet is very expensive. expect to spend hundreds of dollars at the health food store besides grocerys. the supplement combinations mixed with the natural cranberry juice (followed with hot water and lemon juice)made me sick for two days. it was a waste of time and money. i suggest the southbeach diet.
1,Not for everybody,"I didn't like this book, because it doesn't fit my lifestyle. If you have the time to shop the groceries you must shop for the diet and have the time to cook what you need to cook, then I think maybe could work, I don't know.I bought it because I am into the lowcarb lifestyle, and I rather do Atkins a thousand times before doing this program, and it has worked wonderfully for me, I am talking about Atkins of course."
3,some interesting ideas,"I have adapted several of her ideas into my daily regimen, but I think this diet is too rigorous for the average person. I love the long life cocktail and lemon water drinks. I have also taken her advice on some of the supplements (the liver boosting supplements) that seemed to have sped up my weight loss."
5,Good Nutrition Makes All the Difference,"The Fat Flush Plan is an amazing compilation of tried and true nutrition science as experienced, researched, and implemented by Dr. Ann Louise herself. By following the principals of this diet plan and lifestyle eating plan, I have never been healthier. I have lost weight and been able to maintain that loss, I have detoxed and reduced the amount of toxins in my life, I have improved my immune system, I have more energy, I experience less bloating, and my skin and hair has never looked better. The key factors for me have been adding in essential fatty acids (namely from flaxseed oil and black currant seed oil), increasing my protein intake, knowing which carbohydrates work well for my body, and drinking plenty of fluids. I have never felt better or healthier- i recommend this book for anyone who wants to feel as good as I do!"
2,"I'm sure this is a lovely diet, but...","it's not for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money to spare. I've never even heard of some of the foods in the book. It seems to me that you'd have to have your own personal chef to prepare these kinds of things every day. But that is just me. However, I must say that the cranberry water seems to work wonders on its own."
2,Left me wanting more....,"I needed either a lot more time or a personal chef to adhere to this diet. The recipes are tasty, but very labor intensive, and the demand for all fresh and often exotic veggies plus lots of fish, steak and chicken made this expensive. I did lose weight for the few days I was able to stay on the diet, but I was constantly hungry (and therefore grumpy) so my family made me stop the whole thing. I do like cranberry juice in my water, though."
4,Lost 10 lbs in a month,"This was a very well thought out book.Easy to understand and follow. I used all the recipes in the book, they were fantastic! This is the healthiest I have ever felt inside and out, and it truley did take away cellulite. Drink the cran water...Lost 10 lbs. in a month."
5,looking at it from another viewpoint,"Many of the ideas in this book are good; getting off of coffee, regularly drinking an anti-oxident rich drink, etc. If it's too much for you to sustain, -do it when you can-. Unlike diets that don't focus on health, a week here and there will combine to improve your health along with a healthy weight loss."
1,Bad Artwork - Bad Product - Bad CDR Media - Bad Sound,"I got this with the idea that it was a professionally done cd as most on Amazon are.Unfortunately not only do we get the sound of a man singing in a tin can, but these bad sounds are marred by bad lyrics.All gloriously saved on a cdr... that's a cd-recordable disc...Various brands used so there is no real brand and the sticker label along with badly printed artwork make this a waste of time and money.I had to return it because of the unplayability.If Bill is going to use bad product then this bad review should not come as a surprise.If this is his best then there is no need to look further.It's all gonna be bad!"
2,Not great,"I'm always a fan of Exalted's setting, and Waggoner's pacing is solid. But the writing is lousy. The dialogue reads like something out of my 6th grade D&D game and the plot is kinda goofy. A good editor would have improved this book enormously."
3,Not Exhaustive but Practical,"Overall, this is a well organized book. It provides background information on each Biblical festival as well as current traditions. It even has recipes. It is not an exhaustive study of each festival, hence the rating, but it is a really good book for those of you who want to practice the traditions of the Biblical world."
5,In The Jewish Tradition,This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to know about Jewish tradition and the foods associated with it.I have been giving it to people of all faiths who have an interest in religion and food. It is easy to read and understand. The recipes are very good.
4,No problems,"Since this items was ""outsourced"" I was a little leery. But item arrived in good condition (small smudge on inside cover) and delivery was prompt.I already had this book, it was a gift. The recipient was very happy with this item."
1,Cheap plastic connectors,"This might have been a half-way decent bag if the strap did not have very cheap plastic connectors. They are not only cheap plastic but have little paper clip like wires that can pop out easily and then the strap is no longer connected to the bag. This is exactly what happened to mine the first day I used it. You would have to be crazy to carry an expensive laptop or macbook pro in this bag. It is built to break and there is your $2500 Macbook Pro 17"" landing on the cement or floor. Don't buy it."
5,amazing,I love David Martin stronger than the weight is my favorite song period I so wish I could know where he is and what he is doing
3,"Keep up with new material, Ron!","Ron White is obviously very talented and entertaining. I love his delivery (ciggy in one hand, whiskey in the other) but the thing that really bothers me is his redundancy. I swear, he must have used the same jokes for the past 15 years. Ron, you're very talented, but please come up with new material. I just saw his new movie (You Can't Fix Stupid) and I was delightfully surprised with his new material. Keep it up, Ron! I've seen both Blue Collar movies, both of his solo movies, and the Redneck Comedy Roundup. He hardly changed a word of his act in the majority of the previously mentioned movies. Please keep the new stuff coming! I love you Ron, but the same 10 jokes really start to grind on you after awhile."
3,More of the same...,"Let me preface this review by saying that Ron White is one of my favorite comics, and if you've not seen him this DVD will have you rolling. However, if you've seen the Blue Collar Comedy Tour and heard his CD Drunk in Public, this performance is a big disappointment. There is very little new material on this DVD and his timing seems to be a little rushed, almost as if he's tired of hearing the same jokes as well. I love his style, but I would really hate to see himm fall into the Jeff Foxworthy trap of rehashing the same old jokes on every release"
3,classic ron,"His act is pretty funny. This was ron in his normal drunken state. Most of the material is the same used on his coller comedy tour. Although still funny, you would be better off just buying the comedy tour."
2,rehash,too much redundancy with drunk in public. crummy technical work the sound track is out of sync with visual. he's my favorite comedian but stick with DIP
4,It's gonna be a good day Tater,"I loved this show. I had never heared about Ron until I read some rewiews on this DVD here, so I bought it. I have to say I laughed so much I cryed several times during his show. He has such an easy calm flow when he talks, until he hits you smack in the face with a punchline you never saw coming. Really, buy this DVD from the handsome Ron White."
4,"If he could sing, he'd be another Dean Martin","This guy appears to be a country boy gone suburban. Always with a cigarette in one hand and a bourbon (probably) in the other, he was good on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour album. Unfortunately for those who have seen that, about half of the jokes here are the same. Nevertheless, I still like him."
3,Not much I haven't seen,"If this is the first time you're going to be seeing Ron White, it's got some great jokes of his. That is if you can get around the fact that the live audience has a habit of getting very excited after he starts the first line of a joke, creating anticipation that might disappoint.If you've already seen one or two of his skits, you probably won't be seeing too many new jokes. But overall if you're looking for something to hold on to, this isn't bad."
3,Ron White - They Call Me Tater,"My ex husband bought this one and I watched it, but it is not for kids. He is funny I will give him that, but he is not for the timid due to bad lang. or bad thoughts. He is crude at times."
3,Funny Ron,"Ron White has a very funny stand-up comedy routine with a lot of jokes about drinking and acting crazy in public, a crazy deer hunting cousin, and an off the wall, eccentric married life. For those familiar with Ron White from The Blue Collar Comedy Tour, his routine here is sometimes edgier and little cruder. Also, a lot of the material from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour is in this routine - but there's enough new stuff to make it worthwhile.The interview with Ron White as an extra feature was pretty short but it was interesting hearing how he got his start in comedy.Overall I would recommend this DVD because it's something you can get laughs out of every time you watch it, and it's short if you want to run it when friends come over."
3,"Great DVD, I love Ron White,But....","All or Most of the first Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is on this DVD. Yes, I am a penny pincher. A lot of duplicate Ron White material makes this DVD somewhat expensive (and disappointing if you're looking for new stuff)."
3,Not satisfied,"I also ordered a second DVD of the same title right after I placed this order, and I never received it. I'm not sure why, but it was supposed to be a gift for my dad and I ended up not ever receiving it. So, I had to rush out at the last minute to get him a gift. Gee, thanks."
1,IF YOUR HAVING PROBLEMS SLEEPING TRY THIS CD,"This has got to be the worst stand up comedian i have ever seen. The best part of his comedy was when he was ""quiet"" getting a drink or lighting a cig which was often (and yes im a smoker myself). Most of the jokes were boring and he made them worse by pausing and or talking very slow as if ""HERES MY LAME PUNCHLINE""....bbblllaahhh...i forced a chuckle out twice for the minimal wit in this dvd. This was part of the box set and if you would take some advice from me, i havent seen the rest of the dvd's in this set but we have an older Jeff Foxworthy vhs and it was very funny and i have the Bill Engvall cd and its funny and ive heard larry the cable guy is funny and im hoping so ...were watching them next..hope this helps"
4,Funny Stuff,"This is one of Ron White's best DVD's and if you haven't heard him do stand-up before, give it a try."
3,A present,I bought this as a present for an adult child who enjoys this comedian. He is funny but can go overboard on bad language and sexual content.
3,How can this compete?,"With Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory lurking around the corner with online coop play and multiplayer modes; how can Starcraft Ghost keep up? We haven't seen any updates on it from Blizzard, but whats new. I believe when this game comes out its going to have outdated graphics and gameplay. July 1st? Come on. Just my opinion."
1,No MultiPlayer,"Blizzard appears to be indecisive whether there is a MultiPlayer mode or not. The Graphics look awesome but the Company, in my opinion, loses credibility if MultiPlayer is not included. Death Match Mode and On-Line Gaming, in my book, is not MultiPlayer. My kids and I have great fun on the PC versions of StarCraft and I know they will be greatly disappointed. The Game is not worth buying without MultiPlayer Missions."
5,No less than 5 stars until after it is released and played,"...I have been looking forward to playing this game since I first heard about it. I really enjoyed playing Starcraft. I am excited to find out what it's like to see the Starcraft world from ground height. I do not know much about the Starcraft Ghost game, because I avoid reading the game magazine articles in fear they might spoil it for me. But I hope it is the same world and races or units that were in Starcraft."
1,It's Not Gonna Happen,Don't know why they have a release date for this game. Blizzard put it on permanent hiatus and into videogame limbo. I've read there is an outside chance they'll pawn this off on another developer who will ramp it up for next-gen release; but those rumors are largely unsubstantiated.
4,Blizzard Evolution,The The deepest pits of the underworld of the Award winning game Diablo To the Magic Lands of Warcraft and to the Sci-fi world of starcraft now Blizzard is Working on there best game yet Starcraft Ghost. I seen screenshots and The Graphics Are Great and the Combat has Stealth and is great. Blizzard has Made evolution into its Company its world. Get this Great game if you are a good smart gamer
3,Murder in the Charleston Manner,"This was a pleasant read, well plotted and satisfyingly suspenseful. The characters were, mostly, believable in the role they played, with one exception: I found it difficult to believe that the murderer was able to commit the crimes in the manner described. The motives were convincing, just not the method.Other than that everything fell together satisfactorily. With each successive installment in this series Shiela Travis's character becomes more fully ""fleshed out,"" more real, and I find myself looking forward with a delicious sense of anticipation to the next episode in her life."
5,Most beautiful music ever!!!!!!,I LOVE this CD! Its is one of my favorite and I listen to it almost every day. It's very relaxing.
4,nice,"I saw this for cheap, and wanted to listen to the Victorias CDs for a while, and I really do enjoy this. At night, when its time for bed, ill turn it on really low and its great to fall asleep to. Best cd for under a filler I've ever gotten. Thanks."
2,Professor Vic,"These remixes of great 1980s New Wave classics are disappointing. Unlike the Retroactive: Rare and Mixed series by the same publisher, these remixes are not 1980s remixes of 1980s songs, but are rather modern remixes of these old songs. Thus, you are not really getting a collection of 80s tunes but a collection of trance/house music loosely based on these great old numbers. Just not my cup of tea.If you love 80s music and are looking for some rare tracks that bring you to back to the old days, this disc is probably not for you. Choose any of the great Retroactive: Rare and Remixed discs instead.If you like the newer sound but also have some respect for music history, maybe this is up your alley."
2,W.T.F!!!!,"I just received my copy of this Cd today, I pop it in, I start listening to it, I skip to the next song, (yeah I already have it), I get to the third song and Yaz is still playing on track three! I forward the Cd the song ends, small gap and then the third song begins. Again W.T.F.!!! This goes on with the remaining songs. Am I the only one who got a bunk Cd??"
4,Worth the Price for 'Nova Heart' Alone,"I'm a big CD-single collector, and have many CDs from 'alternative' / 'new wave' bands.However, I had never heard this 'Nova Heart' song before, and this Redanka mix is EXCELLENT.After buying this CD, I went and bought the original Spoons CD, to hear the original version. It was a pretty good song originally, but this Redanka mix really takes the song to the next level.If you collect rare music, you know that some CD-singles can cost 10 to 20 times the price of this CD, so buying a CD for one track isn't really that outlandish.The other mixes on the disc are forgettable, in my opinion.Buy it for Nova Heart Redanka mix, it's an excellent track."
4,Great 80's mixes...,"Fort those looking for a 80's Compilation CD with good and stylistic mixes of 80's songs, this is the CD to get. The song selections are good and love the way they had mixed the songs with some modern beats to add flare and hip to the song. Great music to listen to while driving.For parties, great CD to put into the cd player and play with repeat. The other retro CD's are just as good."
5,Reminisce : Retro,"If you're looking for a blast from the past, and some flashbacks in 80's memory, while adding a twist of the present - this is the one for you."
5,Excellent MINI Tachometer,Excellent Little TachometerI bought this in order to tune up the carburetor idle fuel mix on my scooter but it is also fun to use when riding to see my RPM.Installs super easily and is easily readable.Goes up to 8600rpm or more (that's the highest I saw on mine)Great product.
1,Party Foul,"I was really looking forward to using the Eliminator Black Light, however the pacakge showed up damaged with the sounds of broken bulb in the box. The bulb was packed in card board. Really? American DJ is a smarter choice. They use foam around theirs. It makes for a much more pleasant shopping experiance."
1,"Arrived broken, dont risk it","I did read the reviews about broken lights, but I saw a few reviews that said they loved it, so I rolled the dice. Dumb idea. Its not a lie, they REALLY DO ship this in no protection. UPS guy handed me the box and we both laughed at how dumb someone has to be to think a thin piece of cardboard wold protect a light bulb. Come on, spare the expense to ship these better! Maybe the light works, maybe it dosent. half your reviews are about getting the box badly shipped with broken bulbs! You dont get gas money to run back to the UPS drop off to send this back, dont risk it."
3,Panasonic KX-TG2432 Wireless Telephone,"Purchased used, in fair condition.Pros: good connection range, good sound quality, many features, answering machine is easy to setup & use.Cons: small button controls can be difficult to manipulate, time between charging seems to be below average."
3,Fun gift - smaller than I expected,"12 year old loved this, but it was smaller than I expected for the price. Would work best in smaller rooms."
2,good information in a less-than-stellar book,"All of the information was accurate and well-researched, but it was presented in a style that was dry and sometimes confusing. As a catalogue of the elements of liturgical time, it functions nicely; as a book, it leaves something to be desired."
4,Consumer Reports Was Right,Amazing sound system. Speakers are perfect fit for medium size room and the sub supplies plenty of bass. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the DVD Player. The DVD Player is clunky and I've had it freeze up on me in two separate occasions. The picture is great and is easy enough to setup but if my freezing problem continues I will return for a warranty replacement.All in all I love this system!!!
2,I do not like the camera work.,"The music is glorious, but my enjoyment of this DVD is greatly dimmed by the fact that the camera often moves from one shot to another after one second or less. Some viewers may like this approach to showing a symphony concert, but it makes me nervous. Regretfully I cannot recommend this DVD."
4,D. Haddy and Damita...Old School!,"Love it. Some of the best vocals and writing I've heard from D. and Damita...EVER! The song ""Rain On Me"" hit me hard when I first heard it more than 10 years ago, and I still love it!"
2,It twisted at linkage.,It will not last because it twists around the clasp. I've owned many chains and this is the first to do this. I needed a very reliable chain for a cross that has high sentimental value.
2,What's Old becomes New Again,"This new album has only 2 news songs. These two are soft rock, praise. Not the the heavy driving rock that has made up the bulk of their music. The rest of the album is really old stuff. Good praise songs. But me being a headbanger, I was disappointed."
3,A quiet cd,"When I listen for the first time this cd I thought, this is not the Whiteheart that I know. This is a peaceful cd not a rock cd but the music is good. If you don't like the ballads don't buy it, but if you like any kind of music buy it."
3,It's Fun But It Isn't Long Lasting,"It is extreamly fun at first, because the software takes you deeper into the lives of the Dear America girls, but after you read all there is to read about them, it is finished. But you can still keep a diary with the sofware."
1,You'll want your money back after you play it.,"The game is okay, because you get to interact with Dear America characters. But After you interact with the girls, the story is finished. And after I interacted with all 6 girls, the game didn't have much left to do. All you could do was do some quizzes (which repeat themselves until you've played every single quiz) and a diary that you could write in.This game was not worth [the price] .. It should have been [less]."
2,More of a survey than a critique,"Between what this book could do and what it does there is a shortfall. It is a useful and indeed detailed survey of a large number of works with either homosexual texts or subtexts. What there is little of, however, is any real sense of either purpose or argument. There is a basic premise that Homosexuality has been codified since time inmemorial, but this does little to give the book any sort of through-line. Individual chapters, particularly that on the renaissance, which alone could fill a small library with books on male-male love in the period, seem to almost pass their subjects by. Either the book should have been much longer or much shorter. it falls between the stools as an over-padded short look at the subject, which is a pity."
4,THE ONLY WAY!,"If I only would listen to David every day! I truly believe he has a great ability to motiviate and make sure you believe in yourself, which no personal trainer of mine has ever done before. Mind you, it is hard work, but worth every drop of sweat."
1,Unrealistic and unhealthy,"I was very leery of this diet because it is so hard-core (no bread, no cheese, no fruit, no sweets, etc.) for two solid weeks. I thought I would give it a try because nothing is making these last 15 pounds of pregnancy weight BUDGE. Then I looked closer at the book. Some days you do a 90 minute workout. I enjoy working out. I can do that. But the sample days allowed for only about 900 calories per day! I simply cannot function that way, much less be a loving, patient mother to three small children when I am faint and miserable.I feel that to follow this diet would hurt myself both physically and emotionally. There have to be healthier ways to break a weight loss plateau. I am currently trying ""Crack the Fat Loss Code"" by Wendy Chant."
2,Unrealistic,"The book was fine, but I found the diet unrealistic. There were too many things to buy and cook. If I had a personal chef, it would have been great! I found it a total waste of my money."
3,Great book if you are already an athlete,To do the exercises in this book you'll have to be extremely fit and strong. If you're the average person wanting to get in shape I suggest you look at other books.
5,Totally Works--But Really Tough,"I have worked out regularly for years. I bought this book as it was bikini season and I was planning a trip that required wearing one! The workout is REALLY tough. You must commit to 1- 1 1/2 hours EVERYDAY for two weeks straight--if you have not worked out previously, it will be extremely difficult to follow. The diet is also very strict. With that said, I noticed the change in my body shape quite quickly. In my waist area, I noticed definition to my stomach almost immediately. My thighs, which are the hardest part of my body to slim down also changed shape, which was surprising for me. I would recommend it for anyone who can commit to such a strict routine. I definitely had to keep reminding myself, its only for two weeks! I will continue to do his workout routine as I found the exercises very effective."
4,good ideas and concept for someone who enjoys fitness,i have not followed the plan strictly BUT i took a lot of the concepts and used it to achieve my own goals and for that i say this is a good book. the things that are mentioned about intensity and duration are good. the foods you should eliminate are also accurate as far as wanting to slim down for a special event and who hasn't wanted to lose 5lbs for something special every now and then. if you enjoy learning & reading about fitness ideas then buy this book but don't feel like you have to follow it strictly to reap fitness benefits.
2,"a limp, lame romance","Unlike Penny Jordan's usual fare, I found myself unable to really immerse myself in this book. The characters never rang true, and maybe because of this the plot seemed conspicuously thin."
5,Love It! One of my favorite yoga video's,"I really enjoy this video. I'm traveling a lot for my job and my big excuse for not exercising is ""I don't have time"" to go the studio. This has been great I put it on the commuter and have a great yoga session right in the hotel. I've notice I'm much less stressed and my eating habits funny enough are much better. Its a must buy I give it an A+"
5,Great book for reading readiness...,This book lets you teach 49 vowel-spellings with 257 vocabulary words.
2,Not exactly,"I ordered the master bruise wheel - mulit, as described. It came shipped to me with only one wheel of color. All photos and descriptions lead to the assumption there are three wheels of makeup, otherwise why would it cost $15 for one wheel? Plus $6 shipping for something that weighs 6 ounces? I got ripped off."
2,Good price...but a little stale,"This is the correct battery for a V3c Razr and this seller has it for a great price. However, these batteries have a notoriously short life, so I was greatly disappointed to find that the battery that arrived was over 13 months old, just 10 days newer than the battery I was replacing because of its fading life."
5,"Ah, My Phone is Back to Health","The original battery which came with my Razr started giving very poor lifetime only a few months after buying the phone. Someone suggested that this might be due to the in-car charger I was using, so now I have gone back to only using the original wall charger as well as installing this replacement battery.So far so good! I can once again use my phone for several days of my style usage without having to recharge.A great deal!"
1,Battery Can't Hold a Charge,Purchased the replacement battery on 6/30/11 and it can't hold a charge on 8/24/11. The battery life started shortening just after 30 days and now simply can't keep any charge.
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"Very misleading. Says online enabled at the top, making it seem like online multiplayer, it isn't. All you can do is download content and all they offer with that is a single stage. As far as single player goes, all you do is shoot these people once and then they surrender. Horrible gameplay, and voice commands don't work. It's too easy and a total waste of 50.00."
5,Great,The game worked and is lots of fun. Shipping was a bit high I think but game was in perfect condition as promised.
2,This is not a tactical shooter,"This version of SWAT has one good quality, the graphics. The rest of this game is linear, easy and is not a tactical shooter.You get three people on your team. A dude with a mask, some chick with a sniper rifle, and yourself (who looks like the guy from CSI).This game is nowhere near realistic and I think that it is false advertising by saying that this game is a tactical shooter. This is a run and gun shooter. Even the original DooM wasn't this linear.You want a real tactical shooter, buy Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.I cannot like this game because I am used to better games. This game is not even worth renting. I cannot believe that I bought it. It was a blind buy and I regret it."
2,Poor SWAT sequel. Not the same standard at all.,"Wish I did not buy it because the game is really dull and not as good as the other SWAT series games because they have tagged on some sort of a silly story that is not as dramatic as ANY type of SWAT gameplay that we have done before. The graphics however are good and the control easy to use but the game lacks any serious tone or theme, does not have that many functions (3 guns, 5 types of grenades, some updates for guns earned by tokens after you complete a level and 4 or 5 orders you can give to your team mates [max of two only team mates!]). It plays more like some Arcade game as you move about the levels. It is a serious step back in the wrong direction for the SWAT series. I would recommend renting this before you choose to buy it. It is only just okay but the gameplay value is not there and it misses suspense completely. YAWN."
1,Garbage,"Another book that is not worth the paper it is printed on. Who read stuff like this?? The ideas are retarded and some of the people that were involved in the project, like Davey D, are morons and sexually confused talking heads. Bad book, bad advice, bad topic, bad, bad, bad....."
1,Racist,Far better sources found in any number of books that don't resort to racisim. Save your money and time.
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER,"I PURCHASED A SET OF NIVEA CREME FROM THIS SELLER AND ONCE I RECEIVED IT,IT TURNS OUT THAT THE CREME IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO RUB INTO YOUR SKIN AND THEN THE DAMN CREME GAVE ME A RASH ON MY HAND. UPON CONTACTING THE SELLER IM TOLD I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RETURN FEE FOR A PRODUCT THAT GAVE ME A RASH AND REQUIRES 20 MINUTES OF RUBBING TO DISSOLVE. THE SELLERS ATTIUDE AND RESPONSE IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE...STATING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO INSPECT THE ITEM..I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A PICTURE OF MY RASH FOR THEM TO INPECT AS WELL. I AM A FREQUENT SHOPPER ON AMAZON.COM BUT WILL MAKE SURE I NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER...CUSTOMER SERVICE GOES ALONG WAY...AND THEIRS SUCKS."
1,Not For My Sensitive Skin...,"I have dermatitis so it's always scary for me to try a new product, but after reading the good reviews, I decided to go for it. Didn't work for me - ended up getting a rash. The cream itself is very sticky as well. I couldn't rub it on, like literally couldn't, it was so sticky. It has a very waxy texture. Ended up trying Cetaphil after and I'm loving it."
4,A Lifetime User,Started using this after visiting an aunt in Germany and have used it for a lifetime. Now I have to get it online since it is very difficult to find regularly in my community.
2,I make better recipes myself,"Really, Just be creative yourself and make your own. I haven't like anything so far, maybe I'm just a fussbutt (or maybe I'm a better cook!!!!) Probably the former!"
5,More choices! More Joy!,"""500 More"" is a wonderful addition to any low-carb bookshelf. The host of marvelous other recipes is more than welcome, it's a cause for great joy. There are now that many more excellent, and easy, meals I can prepare for my family. Dana Carpencer does it again!Give this book as a gift to all your low carb friends and family."
5,Low Carb Eating,"I absolutely LOVE Low-Carb Cookbooks and the first edition of this book I use and is on my counter exclusively.This second one while it has 500 more recipes from around the world I find it a bit harder to navigate as the titles of many of the recipes use peoples names such as Stephanie Hill's Creamy Cauliflower and Bacon Casserole or MY ALL TIME FAVORITE in this book Gwen Meehan's Yummy Chicken Casserole. Thus it is hard to remember all that. Being a cookbook collector all these years I am used to just going to the category, Chicken, Fish, Veggies etc. and even in the index which is extensive they are listed that way so I have not tried as many of the recipes as I have in her first edition but overall if you are a Low-Carb eater this Book has some yummy recipes. It even has a bonus chapter on how to make your own sugar-free staples, ketchup, BBQ Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, Teriyaki Sauce etc."
3,Not for those on Atkins,"I bought this thinking it was a true low carb recipe book which to my way of thinking, doesn't use breads, low carb or not. There are only a few that I will be able to use and stick to Atkins guidelines but I will keep it since one day I will be able to eat some of the ingredients used in the recipes. I wish I could have looked at a few of the recipes first before buying."
1,Not for South Beach Dieters,"I gave this one star without even trying a recipe. While this book has a good variety of recipes which are ""low carb"", if you are following South Beach, don't buy it! It uses lots of butter, cream and fatty meats! I will be returning my copy."
5,Best low carb author!,"Like Dana's first tomb, 500 LOW CARB RECIPES, 500 MORE LOW CARB RECIPES is my bible - I LIVE BY THESE!!! She is truly the most creative yet down-to-earth cookbook author I have had the pleasure of reading and using, ever. I honestly would not have been able to continue a low carb lifestyle without her books. She brings tremendous variety to my diet, and her recipes are accessible and delicious. This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone even remotely interested in low carb!"
3,The Celestine Vision,"I love James Redfield books but because I like them and read them, this book was more like a summary of the other books and it got boring quickly because it was telling me most things that I already knew. If you have not read and studied the other books and you want a summary, then this would be a good book to start with and then go to the insights."
2,Not much vision,"The book is slightly interesting, but I would not recommend purchase because there are many other works on the same topic that offer greater insight."
4,An excellent reading lamp,"I've been using this as a reading lamp in both my home and work offices for about the past six months, and generally have been happy with it. The other posters certainly are right about the sticky residue, although the company name doesn't bother me, I guess, as I'm withing viewing range of my Samsung monitor, Jamo speakers, Logitech keyboard, Brother printer, etc., etc.)I haven't thought about this lamp as being portable, given that it weighs over 3 pounds, but if you read a lot it might be worth taking along. It certainly is bright, but not overly so. I find the natural spectrum light makes the material easier to read and causes less eyestrain than regular incandescent or fluorescent light. The bulb does put out some heat, so be careful.There's one annoying quirk. In my office, the lamp is near my Tivoli table radio. When the lamp is on, it causes an electronic buzzing on the FM band. There may be some filtering I can do to solve this problem, but I haven't found it yet."
5,Verilux Portable Lamp,"This is a great Lamp, but it is rather heavy to be portable outside the home environment. If you need to pack it for a trip, it weighs about 4 lbs, and tends to be a bit cumbersome."
2,Bogus Bulb Holder,I noticed Verilux fixtures frequently have the same problem in that the bulb loses electrical contact because of a poor design of the holder. In other words the bulb frequently shuts off by itself. This is annoying to say the least. The bulb does give off a nice quality of light but it seems after all this time they would fix the design snafu.
4,Does the job better than an electric blanket,We love the mattress pad. It heats more evenly than any electric blanket and keeps us toasty.
2,mattress pad,"it is more like a paper mat soo thinn you can see right threw it, i'm not happy but i'm keeping it"
4,"Safe, reliable product","This heated mattress pad provides a gentle warming, not a higher temperature akin to a regular heating pad for muscle relaxation. I was a bit worried at first about it being left on for 6-8 hours at a time (sometimes longer) but it has always performed nicely and I would recommend it to others."
1,Plain junk,"I had two of these in less than a month and a half. Both only lasted exactly two weeks. I replaced the first one, thinking that maybe I just got a bad one, but nope, the second one last only 13 days. I would take the second one back, but I cant find the receipt, so I guess Im just going to throw it away. Do not buy, I dont have any other suggestions, but Im going to start trying out other manufacturers, because I definitely need a product like this."
3,"Inconsistent performance, uncomfortable controls at feet","I have had other brands of heated mattress pads but never had these problems. Our pad is two years old, I have never liked the control pieces at the foot, as I like to stretch out and the pieces hurt my toes when I toss and turn in the night. They stick up about 1/4-1/2 inch and have sharp plastic edges that catch my toes and wake me up abruptly. Also, as mentioned by others, some areas are now cold (our unit is less than 2 years old). I am looking to replace and will buy another brand. We bought ours locally and did not keep receipts either."
3,Great when it works!!,"Worked great for first couple years then one side quit working in the pad we reversed the controls and proved it was in the pad, customer service was great replaced pad under warranty, went one year one side of control quit working, haven't tryed for warranty yet, but discouraging that you have to go through all this, looking for a new one but a different brand.Electricity underneath you, better be made better than this kinda scarey when you think about it, put in a arc safe electrical breaker for outlets there plugged into to be safe, a new code in most states."
1,Keep your warranty info handy,"My brother and I both bought Biddeford Mattress Pads (full size) at a local store. It was great having a warm bed, but both pads quit working in less than 90 days. The light fails to go on, and the bed is no longer warm. My brother has returned his, I have long since lost my paperwork. We'll see what happens with the return. Great concept, but I now have doubts about this product."
1,Warranty a joke!,"After less than two years, our Biddeford went out - still covered under warranty. After several attempts to contact customer service (email, webpage, phone) for a ""return authorization number"", I received a single, completely useless email from Biddeford. They obviously are not interested in honoring the terms of their warranty. Also, our pad was sold under the Sealy label - stay away from them; Biddeford makes their electric pads..."
3,Keeps me warm!,"Does a great job of preheating the bed. Love the auto turn off after 10hrs. if I forget to turn it off, but it is really difficult to read the numbers on the dial, therefore it is hard to know whether I'm turning the heat up or down without my glasses and the overhead light turned on. I think it's kindof important therefore I may have to pull out my Sharpie and make the number more readable myself."
1,THESE MATTRESS PADS ARE CRAP,"NO ONE answers at customer service, I bought two of these and they stopped working after 3 months.I WILL NEVER BUY ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AGAIN.I'll bet they have gone out of business.Three messages, talked to two people, never got what I was promised which was a replacement.Good bye!"
3,Biddeford Heated mattress pad,"It works, but is a little lumpy. I had another brand before that was smoother on the bed. I also can feel a squareplastic piece down by my feet. It isn't covered or cushioned."
5,Every night for the entire fall & winter for 2 seasons so far.,"I've loved our mattress warmer. Ours fits the mattress perfectly. We've got the plugs at the head of the bed, and never notice them at all. We turn it on 5 about an hour before bedtime, and adjust it down when we climb in the covers. Toasty warm all over, all night. Helps with stiff back & legs when the weather changes. Then, if you over do the chores it helps with sore muscles too! Going to buy for my daughter & my mother."
2,Not the quality I expected,"I bought this as a replacement for an electric mattress pad I already had that was several years old and beginning to fail.The old one was much greater in quality. This one has thin, papery fabric on the sides, and is much less substantial. It comes unplugged at the end of the bed unexpectedly, so I need to dig it out from beneath comforter, blanket, sheets and another mattress pad to re-attach it.Also, even the highest heat level is only moderately warm. I kept this unit because I needed one, but I would not recommend it, and I will still look for a better one, and use this one on my guest bed."
1,Very disappointed,I purchased the Biddeford heated mattress pad at another store. This has to be the worst mattress pad I have ever purchased. The sides are like paper and it does not stay put on the bed. During the night it creeps up and bunches. No matter what I try to do I cannot keep it in place. The bed has to be completely remade in the AM in order to straigthen out the mattress pad. The plug is on the side of the pad instead of the foot of the pad and your feet end of resting on it. Very uncomfortable. Very poor design. I have now purchased another brand and will be throwing this one out due to the fact I no longer have my receipts. Total waste of money!
3,Good for the price,"This has worked fine for us but, after about a moth it seems like the bottom is not getting as warm as the rest."
3,heated mattress pad,The pad was for my father and I guess it was what he wanted because I haven't heard any complaints.
3,Mattress Pad,Not happy with the thickness of the pad itself. Very thin. The connection at the bottom where the electric cord attaches to the pad catches on peoples feet and toes because the Pad is so thin.Would not buy again.
4,Biddeford Heated Mattress Pad,"This is a good value for the money. I like that you have separate cords to each control, this made it easier to hook up to the head of the bed and eliminated all the cords running underneath the bed."
2,"Plug is in the way, hits your feet","Why they put the plug where they do I have no idea. It hits your feet constantly. When I have time, I'll try cutting the elastic at the head of the bed and shifting the whole pad down about 8"" so the plug is situated over the edge of the bed, rather on top of the mattress as it is now. Hopefully it won't slide off the mattress at that point."
5,Good basic bed heater.,"It gets quite warm. I hope it does not fade over time like other electric blankets/pad.Set up was straightforward.The control is silent (ie, it does not click).Check that you get the right size. I accidentally got a ""full"" for a ""queen""."
2,Very thin and beading already,I just received this and put it on my daughter's bed. I am sad to say it already has beading on it.
1,"Defective, can't return it","Bought this mattress pad in late October. First, the plugs at the bottom are so large that they actually cut our feet (Yes, we have the correct side up!)Two months later, they work only intermittently. The lights on the controls light up, but the pad only heats up about 50% of the time. Tried to call Biddeford; they say to leave a message, but no one calls back. Tried to email, and got no response.Stay away!"
1,Don't Fall For It,"This same product is also marketed under the 'Cannon' bedding brand name. You have to buy it before you get it home, open the package and see the dreaded Biddeford name on the instructions inside. This is not a plesant surprise for consumers who have already had negative experiences with Biddeford. As in my case, two junky Biddeford products in one week.The highest setting on this piece of garbage would still leave you chilly. There's no way this thing could compensate for a cool night in California, let alone a frigid night in the Midwest.Biddeford is crap."
2,Ouch! Watch out for the connector.,"This product is great in that it does what it says it will do. It provides excellent warmth and allows you to cut back on night-time heating costs. Any product in this class will do that. What they don't tell you on the packaging is that where the wires connect to the mattress pad is a bulky box at the foot of the bed with pointy edges. By foot of the bed, I do not mean the side of the mattress, I mean literally where your feet are. I have scraped my ankles on them several times in the middle of the night and it does not feel good! My husband and I have compensated by curling up a bit more or placing our legs in awkward positions to avoid the connector.I had a similar product in the past (no idea who the manufacturer was) and the connectors were in a much better location. Unless you sleep in the fetal position or completely still, I would go with a different brand. Other than the connector, this product works exactly as advertised."
1,electric heated matress cover,I also bought the bickford electric matress cover it worked well last season but this season I plugged it in and it burned up.
1,Seems skimpy,The pad is thin and affords no comfort. I can feel the wiring and plan to return it and get a more expensive pad or an electric blanket.
1,Waste of Money,I purchased this at a local department store and was very disappointed when it quit working after the first cold season. Nice while it works but don't count on this product lasting long.
5,very warm and toastie,For the price this item works very well. My wife can use it on her side of the bed and it does not effect my side as I likes a little cooler sleeping environment.
3,typically French,"This CD contains an instrumental sonata and two `cantata', typically French, featuring a `high' soprano. Although I have ripped all to the hard drive of my Mac and use the best speakers one can buy through Apple these sound `thin'. Not bad but nothing to get `Wowed' over."
4,f.valdes,"it is good,subwoofer needs a little more punch.when doing the adjustment((hint) for highier sound quality put (the sound by-pass )in off position.Although front speakers sound good,they could had sound better if they were accoustically improved.I am almost an audiophile.In general I like this yamaha specially for music."
3,scholastic book services book about the TV show,"this 92 page paperback is about the fun 1970s tv show,""rhoda"". this show was a spin off from the mary tylermoore show. rhoda was portrayed by actress valerie harper. the author of this book interviewd her and alsodavid groh,the actor who played rhoda's husband on the show. valerie describes some of her personal backgroundand what led up to her being hired to work on the mary tyler moore show so,it has a little insider infobut,nothing to get very excited over. this book has 32 black and white photos of the actors and from the rhodatv series. a nice book for fans of the show."
2,Disappointing because.....,"It's too bad when a small company with a good idea becomes a large commercial machine with little content. I'm so sick of seeing Baby Einstein advertising itself everywhere - even within their own videos once you've already purchased them. It's the same old stuff you see recycled in almost all of their baby videos - once you have one, you pretty much own the entire set. I do think there is some value in infant videos and they can do more than just babysit your children. But there doesn't seem to be a good bridge between Baby Einstein and videos like Blue's Clues or Sesame Street. Juno Baby is a very nice and cute transition with some characters and pretty music and offers a bit more stimulation. Another nice idea might be the Sesame Street for babies videos which are supposed to come out pretty soon. The bottom line is that I think Baby Einstein sells babies a little short and underestimates what they're capable of hearing and understanding."
5,Very well designed,"This is the ONLY baby einstein video I have ever thought was educationally valuable at all (I have a doc degree in child psych). I admit I am not a baby einstein fan, since it seems that most of them demonstrate little awareness of how children acquire language. The other ones I have seen are slow paced, with little thought towards helping infants make logical connections between words and concepts, the baby Noah is fantastic. It follows a predictable format that repeats names of animals with multiple images of those animals set to upbeat music, as well as shots of interesting toys and cute puppet shorts. The dvd is fast paced with lots of repition, and the overall tone is humorous and exciting. My 8 month old son is fascinated by this one, while he has never given any of the others more than a passing glance."
1,Not as good as the others we own,"I bought this for dd last week and she actually cried!!! I found it wasn't as good as the others we have (Baby Neptune, Baby Bach, Baby Noah and Beby McDonald) She loves her Baby Einstein videos but not this one!!"
5,The BEST Baby Einstein I've seen - GREAT for my 1-year old,"I have the Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart - they are still great, but especially when my daughter was 7-12 months. We bought Baby Noah for her 1-year birthday and she LOVES it, and when we watch Beethoven and Mozart I almost feel like she's already outgrown them. This one is definitely a little more advanced - for a slightly older child. The music is great because it's stuff that an adult would like to listen to also - it doesn't get on my nerves like the other 2 DVD's did after a while. For example, when they play the music for the Tropics, it's steel drum and so catchy. My daughter is fascinated by this one, and gives me a great time out for a few minutes if I need to run do something (baby is safely in her play yard, of course!) If you buy this DVD - you won't be sorry!"
5,Noah,"My son love this DVD, at last we have found something that he will watch instead of ""Baby McDonald"". He gets very excited when he hears the opening music and when the puppets come on. The DVD takes you all over the world to discover the animals that live there. It is a great learning tool and has pleasant music which, so far hasnt got to annoying."
3,Baby Einstein - Baby Noah DVD,"In all honesty, we didnt have to buy this video, it was given to us. But, my judge of a good video is if I would buy it for our family, spending our hard earned money, if it wasnt given to us. The answer here is an emphatic ""yes"". The video is cute, it includes animals grouped into regions, rainforest, savannah, etc. It presents the animals in various forms, puppets, toys, real video and pictures. My son who is 15 months loves to watch it. Although I do think it is a bit long, running time around 30 minutes+ which is a bit long to sit a kid of his age in front of a video without feeling guilty. Some of the other videos in the Baby Einstein collection are a bit shorter (20-25 min) which I think would be a good limit for all kid videos, since Im not a supporter of having videos babysit your kids. The video isnt going to win any awards for directing or screen play - but come on, its a kids video afterall!"
4,great baby movie,"works greatlove the french language option because i'm french and want my son to learn it,he is 7 months and loves all the baby einstein movies"
3,why noah?,"fabulous concept: showing (ostensibly american) children the world of animal diversity, by visiting different climatic regions. a fitting subject for the baby einstein genre. so what historical genius traveled the world, discovering and documenting the diversity of animal life? that's right: darwin.but beyond disney's fear of a subject controversial only to the uneducated, this video is a big hit with my kids. the two main pluses are the diversity of animals it shows, and the monologue seems sufficiently subdued to allow me to do the naming and explaining to them (although i have a hard time explaining why an elephant is refereeing an ice block race between two penguins)."
3,What about Noah?...,"My 9 mo old daugther is really into animals so of course she loves this DVD. I think it is a wonderful introduction to different types of animals from all around the world. In fact that is all it is: an introduction to animals.- I think it is wrong of the Baby Einstein company to use the name from the bible story Noah's Ark without telling the story- They just show the animals floating around on an ark. (no reason given - no Noah - no storyline!) They even have dolphins on the ark -which I think is ridiculous- being that Dolphins would not have been on the ark in the first place-since they live in the water! Anyways all in all like I said, my child likes this DVD but I am not that impressed. I mean, I know no one likes to push religion but if you have the nerve to use the name Baby Noah -at least tell the story! We own a lot of the Baby Einstein DVDs and have always been happy with them- but I guess I was just let down with this one."
4,Great animal footage!,"My 9 month old loves this video. We had Mozart, Beethoven and Santa (DO NOT buy) already. This one is a lot different because there is actually moving footage of the animals with great music. He is too young to get into the animal naming parts, so he gets bored then, but whenever the puppets or the music come on he is mesmerized. The DVD says its for older children, so maybe naming the animals won't be as boring for him in a few months. I like watching it with him. I'd give the DVD 5 stars, but Disney is completely shameless in placing ads at the beginning and end of the DVD during the first play. I vow not to buy another with this sort of advertising no matter how good they say it is."
3,Same old songs....,"My 15 month old daughter loves the B.E. animal DVDs, so I got her Baby Noah. It is cute and all...I just wish that the Baby Einstein Orchestra would learn a couple new songs. The songs are just remixes of the music used on the other DVDs."
3,It is an ok dvd,"For whatever reason my daughter just wasn't interested in this dvd....I think it might be because alot of the dvd shows the animals on flash cards and opening the flash cards on the screen gets sort of expected throughout the dvd. I would have to say that I was expecting a little more scenic of a dvd after watching the Baby NEPTUNE...highly reccomended by the way. I would say that is the #1 keeper of the collection...my daughter also likes my first signs and baby's favorite places, other than that the others ones she eventually became disinterested. Every child is different so your child may or may not love this dvd !"
4,"Good Score, Bad Release","The score for Small Soldiers is superb! Tracks 1, 3,4, and 9 are amazing! Bold military marches sets the mood for this also enjoyable film. But on flaw remains. The release for this score was done none other than score stingy Varese Sarabande. There is a good amount of score left out on this CD. Such as company mougle Gil Mars theme, which I rather enjoyed, is missing in the release. Of course Sarabande is known for 30 minute releases. I.E. Air Force One, Deep Blue Sea and Dante's Peak. Which contained huge amounts of good score left out by penny-pinching Varese Sarabande.Hopefully in the future, a not-so-stingy record company will release extended versions of this and other scores released by Sarabande."
2,Not quite what I was looking for...,This is a very comprehensive text on what is required for a PMO but not quite what I was hoping to get. I was hoping for a book that gave more specifics about how PMO's work rather than a more broad based treatise on the scope and requirements of a PMO. My search continues...
2,Is it possible to have a proj. mgmt. book less than 600 pages?,It seems that someone wanting to glean the principles of project mgmt is doomed to wade through endless pages of often duplicated material.
5,Rare Repertory,"Note: This recording is published by Unicorn-Kanchana (catalog #9124), not Harmonia Mundi.On this CD:1. Cantata ""Con qual cor""2. Cantata ""No, non fuggire o Nice""3. Cantata ""Qual pensier, quale ardire""4. Cantata ""Ti ricorda o bella Irene""5. Cantata ""Tirsi caro"""
5,fog juice,"i did not know at the time i bought it how little it takes to run a fog machine, so i am excited that my son has plenty of fog juice to keep him happy for a long time"
2,Fog juice,Dont last the smoke clear it out quickly i try it in party's !! better if buy hi intencety last more in the air
3,Imperial Germany through American eyes,"Until I googled the author, I never would have guessed Gerard's hatred for Germany. Over the nine decades since WWI, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Germany have been scapegoats for the cause of WWI. Certainly Imperial Germany shouted the loudest, but WWI was caused by many other factors. Despite this, if you're looking for a book covering the last year before WWI and into 1917 in Germany, this is a pretty nice book. It grows a trifle tedious as the author writes chapter after chapter about the Prisoner's of War, but it's well-written. Free copies are available on the internet if you aren't keen on purchasing a hard copy."
5,Awesome Cast!,"If you are looking for a movie with an awesome cast, then Judgment Night is for you. Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jeremy Piven and Stephen Dorff. Four guys that give an incredible performance, showing no fear and a great deal of courage. Even though the movie ends with only three of the four, they all make the movie a hit."
5,judgment night,judgment night is a story about 4 guys on their way to a boxing fight when they end up in the wrong area i love this movie its a great thriller the cast is great and the music is cool rent or buy this movie its one of my favorties 10/10
5,Judgement Night,I love this movie and have rented it many times hence the reason I purchased the movie. The Cat & mouse chase is brillient and the actors are also great. However I could not view this purchased movie as it is not the same region as Australia. Therefore I won't be purchasing any more movies from this website.
5,DAMN GOOD MOVIE,"This was a gr8 action thriller,suspense,violence,laughs,good old fashioned fighting and Stephen Dorff in tight jeans.What more could a gal want?"
4,GREAT,Great thriller that will have you jumping out of your seat at times. This was a fantastic thriller about four eyewitnesses of a murder who run for the lives after a group of gansters goes after them.
4,Judgement Night,Excellent from start to finish. A bit corny at times because it was the early 90's but the sound track music for that time was way ahead of itself. I liked!
4,Judgment is upon you,"What a great tale of survival of the fittest. Their's no time for reasoning when you're dealing with the other side of town.A great cast that make the movie, although how many bullets can a gun have?"
5,"Great movie, worth buying","Tons of action and suspense. I saw it a few years ago and i picked it up today. It was so cool! Steven Dorff, Emilio Estevez and Cuba Gooding, Jr. Were awesome! So was Dennis Leary. Who ever the loser was who played Ray seriously sucked and was perfect for the part of the coward. Who ever has seen this movie will agree, one of the best movies of all time."
5,A Classic Suspensful Thriller...One of a Kind!,"If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing an amazing experience. Great acting all around, and Dennis Leary is hilarious! One of the most realistic movies I have ever seen, trust me, you'll see what I mean."
3,judge ment rules,"when 4 friends decide to go to a boxing match, all hell brakes out and end up seeing a murder, when they are considered as witnesses the phycho killer decides to off there head of as well, thats when the big chase happens when there ready to be judged in blood,when it looks like there outnumberd and they decide to stop running and fight back in the streets, because it's the night when they have to be judged dead or alive."
1,Used,"This product was described as like new. However, I guess used is used. The dvd was ok but the case wasn't. There was writing on the case of the dvd. Someone had marked it up with a silver marker. At least the dvd worked."
4,"Good, but gave me wrong impression of Denis Leary at first","This was the first movie I ever watched with Denis Leary in it, and at the time, I was shocked at the part he played, because in my mind, he's a COMEDIAN! Don't get we wrong. He plays his part well, but it was just the idea of him playing such a heartless vicious person, that I almost got up and left the theater in the middle of the movie, and when I got home I was ""this close"" to taking my copy of No Cure For Cancer to a used CD store, but luckily I didn't. It did however took a watching of ""The Ref"" to snap me out of it with him. If you are a fan of Denis Leary, and would like to see him in FUNNIER roles, I would suggest at least watching Gunmen (although still a bad guy here, he is a much funnier one), or The Ref."
3,"Pretty good ""Deliverance""-style fun","Not too bad. I'd seen it years ago when it first came out and watched it again last night. Dennis Leary really does a good job in this movie (his first big role). He's a convincing tough guy and doesn't rely on ranting too much. I think he has the talent to become a good character actor (""The Ref"" and ""Suicide Kings"" being two more good Leary projects). Jeremy Piven also did a good job as the self-destructive member of the suburbanites."
5,Judgement Night,I've always liked this movie so I wanted to get it in DVD.. i had it in VHS tape. It arrived safely and quickly and is in very good condition.
5,Awesome!!,This movie will have you on the edge of your seat! So many unexpected things occur that you can't guess what's coming next. I loved it.
5,A very good introductory text,This text was used in my Intro to Biological Anthropology course and I found it to be very useful and interesting. The sections on evolution and genetics are very similar to the material covered in Campbell/Reece's widely used Biology text. I often found myself skimming through chapters that weren't even assigned for class because the material was so fascinating. Key terms are conveniently located in the margins of the text for easy flash card making and studying.
3,Not a bad addition to your collection of Hollywood books,"The definitive book on 1940s Hollywood is probably Otto Friedrich's ""City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's."" But if you're looking for something to expand your library of books about Hollywood during its golden age, you might want to get this one. While it's not authoritative or exhaustive by any means, it's an alternative look at an endlessly fascinating time and place.City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's"
1,Beware,"This is not a Red Book CD. There are no notes. What's more, there is no way to know that Amazon has not made this CD-R from low-quality mp3 files. For your information, Arkiv Music is selling only mp3s of this disc. I still have no idea why Naxos would pull the item from their catalog. Several other discs of Rawsthorne's music still are available. I recommend the Cello Concerto/Symphonic Studies."
4,Like it.,"Very happy with this, the links were not as close together that I would have, it's really hard to determine that 'when you are viewing the item on line."
5,Learn from the best,"Although there's a lot of valuable history in its pages, I bought this book because I wanted to become a better speaker. Nothing in here can help you with the delivery of your own speeches, but reading these wonderful extracts of some of the world's greatest speeches can't help but inspire. I especially appreciated Mr. Safire's ability not only to recognize a great speech, but also to define for the reader the qualities that made the sppech great and to place it within a historical perspective. I'm still not a great speaker, and probably never will be, but at least this book has given me plenty of role models."
4,Lend Me Your Ears,"Great for all history buffs! I found that reading the full texts of so many famous speeches throughout history was exciting on its own, but also added a valuable perspective to my understanding of the cicumstances in which they were delivered."
2,A book of speeches for Republicans,"Mr Safire was a much better commentator on the English language than a selector of speeches. This volume, while weighty, is so skewed to his Republican American audience as to be useless to other English-language speakers. Mr Safire fills his 1000 page tome with such immortal speeches as George Bush I's acceptance of the Republican nomination in 1988; and Robert Dole's eulogy to Richard Nixon in 1994. These he equates to the speeches of Pericles, Webster, and Cicero; Danton, Napoleon, and Churchill; Roosevelt, Shakespeare, and Gandhi.I commend this volume to all dedicated Americans who vote for the Republican party. Everyone else should search elsewhere."
4,"released 7 years ago as stormy night, great wailing souls","this is a great wailing souls record but they did'nt get paid for the original so i hope they do this time. Skank on Bread and Pipe and keep us skankin through the millinium and beyond. Upsweet and Ting yeah, make ya head ting-a-ling!!"
4,Good Little Wash Cloth,"I've been using Vic's wash cloths for a long time - although I haven't bought any for a while. It seems as though they have gotten a little thinner - but bigger in size. This is a great, sanitary way to exfoliate since you can throw the wash cloths in the washing machine with your towels and other wash cloths."
3,Roots and Elements,"This is a very well blended lp. With live performances from the Boukman Experience, Majek Fishak, Justin Hinds and Long Beach All Stars. Its a fragrant album that keeps you moving the entire time. Reggae, African and dub, you can't go wrong with this mixture."
2,Rachmaninoff Masterpieces with nothing special,"Glesmer has been a good player in the Naxos game-witness his Scriabin Sonatas and the Tchaikovsky Concertos. However, in Rachmaninoff he plays all the notes, and the orchestra is with him all the time, but there is no profile, nothing special about these performances. They are like driving in a very fast car and you have a pleasant experience, but you come away feeling unfulfilled. Spend more money and hear Byron Janis in the First concerto, Tamas Vasary, Phillippe Entremont or Vladimir Ashkenazy in the Fourth, or William Kapell, Julius Katchen or Artur Rubinstein in the Rhapsody."
5,i met the author -- she's as funny as this book,"Grace in the First Person is equal parts funny and inspirational. A hard mix to do well, but this author does. I liked it so much I bought 4 extra copies to give away to friends I deem ""worthy!"" Hope she writes more of this stuff."
5,Did the trick!,"When my Fiance's blinker stopped working, and we changed the bulb, it would stay lit and not blink. The car still thought it was blown, since it was ticking fast.Reading forums, I found someone who had a similar problem who said they solved it by replacing the socket, and someone else who said they melt almost so you don't notice. Replacing the OEM socket with this one fixed the problem, and it works perfectly now."
5,Interesting read for those interested in financial history,100 great biographies of the most influential personalities that affect the markets even today. If you're interested in how our markets developed from it's chaotic beginning this is a great book. I particularly enjoyed the section on crooks and scams. It's amazing some of the things people will do.
4,"OK, I guess",Well I was reading this book. My friend got it. He passed the test by just reading this book. He's not a very smart guy when it comes to computers. He said that it was easy to read and easy to understand.
1,What a load of biased trash...,"This is, without a doubt, the most one-sided, biased, piece of sensationalist garbage I have ever had the misfortune to own. I purchased a copy of this book at a used book store for one dollar - and I want my money back. I don't know how whoever composed the ""blurb"" for the inside cover flaps sleeps at night. ""Most significant forCatholic readers is the fearless and absolutely impartial treatment given here of the religious aspects of Elizabeth's reign..."" This book is not impartial in the least - that is a complete lie. I won't burn my copy - I'm not a book burner - but I will donate it back to the place of purchase. I could never take money for this trash and sleep at night."
3,"general info, not detailed enough","This book covers a lot of topics, but usually just gives general info that I could've found by typing the topic into any search engine. I have a few other books that I use much more often (what to expect the first year and baby's first year week by week)."
3,"Good info and well-written, but not comprehensive","I enjoyed reading through this book and it has some good reference information that I will probably use, but overall I would not give it a high rating because for an ""A-Z"" type reference book it does not have that many topics. I do like the approach that the authors take to child care, but there are probably better books out there."
3,"Some good tips, not enough specifics","This book addresses a wide scope of topics, but rarely treats any of them with the amount of detail I'd like to see."
4,A book for AP parents,"If you support the attachment parenting philosophies of Dr. Sears and Katie Allison Granju, you will love this book. If, however, you're after a book that is a little bit more mainstream, this may not be the book for you and you may wish to stick to a less AP-oriented baby book. This book assumes you will be opting for extended breastfeeding, co-sleeping, and that you will be using the night-time parenting strategies spelled out in the author's other book. If you're not making these particular parenting choices, this book may leave you feeling a bit guilty for the parenting choices you have made."
5,A longtime favorite coffee in our home!,First thing in the morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news. We have always drunk Maxwell house coffee and even when I was a child my parents used it. It is one of the best coffee brands available. As we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the Maxwell House Decaf blend. It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder. On sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping. This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.
5,Good Deal,"My husband is a big coffee drinker, and with a deal like this I can order ahead and never have to worry about running out. I hate to have to run to the store because I am out of one thing."
3,How Arthur Got His Glasses,"Arthur needed glasses,missing basketball shots,and doing every single problem on the math test,so he got glasses,and everyone called him,Four-Eyes."
1,Not good.,Don't waste your money on this product. There are others available which will work very well for a bit more money. I still have my unit but not sure what to do with it. Could post it on Ebay but would not sell this thing to my worst enemy. Again spend a little more money and get something you know will work. I eventaully purchased a nmae brand and it worked perfectly out of the box.
1,Not working out of the box!!,The only plus is the item was shipped quickly. Although it doesn't help when this did not even work out of the box! I sent it back for a refund.
2,welder,the wire feeder on this welder doesn't feed the wire very well I think it would be ok If I could get the wire to feed steady.
5,welder,"My son and daughter love this welder. He sold his huge one so he could enjoy something easier to handle, use, carry, and work with. This one gives him a lot of pleasure! I am so glad we found it online!"
3,The Princess bike with fairies?,"I ordered this bike thinking that it had the Disney princesses on it, or something similar. Instead it has fairies. The name seems a little misleading. It was also hard to put together. The pedal assembly took over an hour to put together. My husband had to file the end of the medal rod that the pedal is supposed to fit on to. Overall, I do not regret ordering this bike. My daughter, who is 3, absolutely loves it. It was her favorite Christmas present."
2,16 in princess bike didn't work for us,"Not as happy as I thought I would be with this product. Didn't think it was worth the money, really. It looks extremely worn after a few months of play. I feel it difficult to put together, part was missing, was awkward to sit in and the the paint lost its brightness and stickers came off after a few months. Sorry, but this one is not a keeper."
3,Mixed,"Wow! What a nightmare to assemble--four adults, two different group attempts, multilple customer service calls and additional tools. Should plastic items be this time consuming and difficult to assemble?!?! But in the end do my two, two-year olds love their Big Wheels-you bet! Unless your child has long legs, wait till he/she is closer to three years old."
1,big wheel,it is NOT the original big wheel i recall. it is built flimsy. the method by which the pedal is held on is by way of a lockwasher. the plasic pedal constantly falls off because the lockwasher falls out. good luck trying to get one.after trying many stores i found a similar one at home depot and bought 12 of them. i emailed the company (Gelavi) and asked them to send me a new lockwasher but They never even responded to my email. i won't ever deal with them again.
1,poor construction,"bought this toy at target today for half the price that it's listed on amazon which i thought was a plus, turns out it was all just a waste of time. the washer they provide to secure the pedal to the pedal bar doesn't allow the pedal to rotate so my daughter had to take her feet off the pedals half way through the motion on every rotation of the pedal. the end caps they provide for the rear axle are weak and aside from one breaking today i'm sure they would've fallen off soon (they don't clip onto anything it's just a tight fit). i wouldn't recommend buying this for any price, it's not worth anything if your kids can't ride it."
4,Crusader Castles,"A good handbook to the castles erected or occupied by the Crusaders from the beginning of the First Crusade through to the conclusion of Salah al-Din's campaigns against the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The detailed text is supported by several color plates, numerous color photos and black and white diagrams, a substantial bibliography, and a handy list of all the major Crusader castles, giving their French or Latin, Medieval Arabic, and modern day Hebrew, Arabic or Turkish names."
5,Firestore FS-4Pro,Is this the future? Well I think so. The recording is great - the interfaces are clunky and ugly. They look like dos about 20 years ago and it is still much too expensive but all that will change. i would advise anyone travelling to forget the stock of tape and move to one of these. The files are easy to transfer onto hard drives and so leave you free to film and film.
1,ebay or paper weight!,What a waste! Please be sure you understand what type of files this thing makes and how many before you buy....I am a professional documentary film maker and I find this to be one of the biggest mistakes I ever made....Garbage
4,Not quite what I expected.,"This is not quite what I expected. I is mostly a cookbook with recipes, most not writen with the usual McManus humor."
2,Must like to cook,"At least half of this book is recipes. We love McManus, but probably would not have bought this book if we'd seen it on the bookshelf."
5,Great Book!,This book really introduces teens to the idea of getting a job. Prevola and Hobgood are amazing writers. They should get an award! This book really moved me and made me think about the future and getting a job. If you decide to get this book you will not regret it!
3,Sweep 13: Reckoning,"Reckoning focuses solely on Alisa. Alisa is still dealing with the fact that she is a blood witch. She decides to tell Mary K. about being a blood witch. How will Mary K. take it? Then one night after a gruesome fight with her father and Hilary, Alisa decides to go to her mother's hometown and meet her family. But not everyone recieves Alisa with open arms. While there Alisa learns much more about herself and her family. She also starts to fall for Charlie, her cousin's boyfriend.Not my favorite Sweep story. There was like no Morgan in this one. And frankly it was kinda boring. Better luck next time!"
5,Different spin which made it very good!!,"Recokoning felt like I was reading a totally new book. Seeing the book through someone else that has not been in the book very long was very good. Also getting away to another town and being introduced to new, and interesting people was also great. The relationshoip between her and Charlie was exciting. This book did deserve the highest rating and if the starts went higher i would take it up more."
2,not one of the best in the series,well first of all this is a sorry book because the book description has nothing 2 do with the plot of this book. this book centers around alisa who just discovered that she's a half blood witch and founded that her mom was one also. so she travels to where her mom used to live bcuz of the problems she is having at home with her stepmom and dad. this book centers around how alisa meets her mom's family and stays with her uncle while visiting her mom's family. she is having a hard time controlling her telekinesis and was told she was born with it. well i thought this was one of the worst books in the sweep series cuz its starts out REALLY SLOW AND BORING. there's barely any interesting plots and i thought the plots were boring. this book is a snoozer and i recommend that u should wait til full circle comes out i hope it be better than this book. this is not a good book at all. i give it just 3 stars for lack of good plots and the book startin really slow.
4,Not a necessary novel to the sweep series.,There are fifteen books in this series and this book is the only one I didn't have. I took a chance and read the the rest without this one. Bottom line- this book is well written but not necessary. The book actually reminds me of a novella from any other series.
3,Reckoning,"Alisa Soto is the main character in this book. As for Morgan and Hunter, their roles are told through the eyes of Alisa, and she describes so vividly the love that us shared between the two blood witches. In Reckoning, Alisa has to confront her heritage and eventually find her place of belonging in her mother's side of the family...."
3,Another good book from the series...,"I thought this was a good book. ... I thought it was really interesting.It starts on how Alisa doesn't like her future stepmother and her uncontrollable telekenisis. She decides she wants to find out more of her mother's family(since they are witches.)She discovers new things about her family and she sorta finds peace after what she finds.Also a man enters her life,Charlie."
5,Cate Tiernan is awesome,"This entire series is soooooo good...Cate tiernan is absolutely talented. You find yourself unable to book these books down, you have to find out what is happening.....A Must Read series!!!!"
1,The Jacket case is alright,"I purchased the black Jam Jacket for my new 30gb ipod and i have to say it picks up lint and makes it look like a white case. and it doesn't fit on my jbl speaker system because the jacket is thick and by making it thick it make's it look like a 1st generation ipod. i like to use my jbl speaker system when I'm not playing my music off my computer and having with the jacket so thick, especially on the sides i have to pull the jacket off every time I use it. It's a pain to have to take the jacket off and on when I want to use my jbl speaker system. I wanted something to cover my ipod so it doesn't get scratched, which the jacket does, but it makes it inconvenient for me to use my ipod with my jbl speaker system."
2,My husband is disappointed,"It worked for a year and a half and now it doesn't work..not with new batteries, manual suggestions or all the ""tips"" that we've read from reviewers. In this age of electronics, this is a real disappointment. Save your money !"
4,"Pretty good, but the manual's wrong","This is a nice little indoor/outdoor temp unit. It was easy to set up and seems accurate. My only complaint is that I'm not able to reset the min and max temperature readings. The manual says to hold the min/max button for 5 seconds, but it doesn't do anything. I bought this item instead of some cheaper ones I saw so that I could have the min/max feature, but it doesn't do any good if it can't be reset.UPDATE 11/11/2010: I finally got frustrated with not being able to reset the Min and max readings, so I emailed La Crosse a week ago and got this response: you have to hold BOTH the min/max button AND the channel button for 5 seconds to get it to reset. And you have to do this separately for the base and for each remote sensor. So their manual is wrong. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 4."
2,Nice while it lasted,"The outdoor temperature sensor stopped working after 1 year. Replacing batteries didn't work. Being that the outdoor temp measurement was what I bought the product for, it's disappointing."
4,Well-plotted and classic,"This page turner sticks with me months after I've read it; the timeliness of the topic and the depth of the characters make it a fascinatingly fun read. Anderson has successfully combined the classic sci-fi ""morality play"" genre with a cutting-edge it-could-happen techno thrill ride. I'm waiting for more. I'm saving my fifth star for the next things he writes!"
2,A Plague Upon This Novel!,"An interesting (if farfetched) concept: By the 2060s Mexico is the world's superpower. Ruled by a high-tech savvy regime propped up by Mestizo racialism and a breakaway Church that has its own pope, the Holy Republic of Mexico extends from Venezuela to its recent reconquests of Arizona, New Mexico and half of Texas. The United States is beaten, fractured, and barely able to maintain much further resistance to Mexican desires for whatever remains of her western states. Into this scenario comes a plague that quickly kills those who are predominately of Indian background--in another words, the overwhelming majority of Mexico's population.Too bad that such an intriguing backdrop like this one was ruined by flat characters in a confusing and quite boring mess of a plot from an author pathetically aping Crichton, Ludlum and (of course!) Dan Brown."
1,Simply awful,"You have a doctor who can't speak correct English, another doctor who has a God complex, another doctor whom we don't know much about because the author doesn't really bother with such nonsense as character depth, a cyborg that runs a country, and a schizophrenic nun.Mexico is a superpower, and, right in the former Mexico City, which is, like, the center of the world, obviously, dengue breaks out. Tons of people die, and a team of doctors has to figure out how to stop this outbreak.The language is so awful, you want to get through this book as quickly as possible, so any details just get lost."
4,sedaka still going strong,even though the 70s was his best decade he cowrote solitaire4patriciapaay here the 'perfect strangers_melody remains his greatest performance so far
3,XP Book,This is a nice book for those that use XP. It was not what I expected. The seller did a good job. The book was recommended to me by some one else.
1,Junk. Don't wast your time.,"This book was mentioned in the New York Times book reviews, so I bought it and read it. I was very disappointed. His depiction of chess players was juvenile (take that everyway possible). The author has tons of academic credentials, but he is a terrible novelist."
3,"Been there, seen that, done that","I have been in the Dominican Republic. For about two hours around midnight at the international airport of Santo Domingo, back in 1979. The toy and gift shops were closed. I was disappointed."
2,Dominican Flag??,"The blue quadrants on the flag are not the correct shade of blue. Instead of the light blue it has the Dominican flag's blue is navy blue.When I got the package I was initially thrilled as the size was exactly what I wanted, as was the material. Unfortunately when I opened the flag and saw the light blue color I was completely disappointed.Total bust!!"
1,Wrong signs!!!,"You sent me the wrong signs!!! Instead of ""Customer Parking Only"" you sent me ""NO Parking"" I've been in the hospital and unable to respond till now. I am at a loss. What should I do???I don't have the packing box, nor the return label. Employee threw them out."
1,Waste of money,"Last Full MeasureThis item was ordered because we loved Gods and Generals and Gettysburg. This dvd was described as the 3rd part to the Trillogy. Wrong. It came in a dvd case which was about the Vietnam War. There was a sticker on the case saying Last Full Measure Gettysburg. When you start the dvd which has a Vietnam War label, it begins with an airplane. Then Stacy Keach starts talking. It is a documentary that lasts approximately 1 hour. This is in no way worth $14.99 plus tax and shipping. This is a total disappointment and should have been given free with the other 2 movies. Don't buy it. Waste of money and time."
1,Last Full Measure is a BOOK in a trilogy,"Yes, at the end of Gods and Generals, there is a note about a Civil War trilogy which includes (in chronological order)Gods and Generals, Gettysburg (or, the book title: Killer Angels), and The Last Full Measure. However, only the first 2 are movies. All 3 can be bought as a book trilogy---which preceded the films. (Except there is apparently a 30 min. VHS tape called Last Full Measure, which is a short documentary about Gettysburg, but not a motion picture.) Hope this helps! (I give 1 star only because I bet most of us were hoping there was a 3rd motion picture to the series!)"
1,not nearly full,I purchased this video tape expecting to get a sequel to gettysburg. what i got was a half hour re-hash of gettysburg from stacey keach a real bummer
1,This is not a movie.,In Gods and Generals this movie was touted as the third part of the trilogy to include Gettysburg. This is not a movie so if your expecting a sequel to Gettysburg your going to be disappointed. Unfortunately you won't know what it is till you open up the package.
1,Don't Pull the Wool Over My Eyes,"I to enjoy the History of our country. The civil war was a great era in our history. Gods and Generals / Gettysburg deserves a third part. Thank you for informing me that ""The Last Full Measure"" is not that trilogy."
1,Ultra Low Budget - less than half an hour long,"I watched this last night and much to my dismay the entire show lasted slightly less than half an hour. It was produced by a local PBS station in Pennsylvania and the amateurish and dull presentation was surprising due to Stacey Keach's involvement.I was interested in viewing this because of Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton's involvement. Sadly, Catton did not really come across particularly well (he was, after all, quite elderly in the footage shown); nor did he make comments beyond the most superficial regarding this quintessential American battle."
1,Last Full Measure/Not Filmed or Produced,"The Last Full Measure is probably in book form only. We owe Ted Turner some gratitude for producing Gettysburg and God's and Generals, I suppose he ran out of money, or ?; so he never ventured into the end of the trilogy. Too bad, it would have been another good one."
1,Try Pharoah's Army and Wicked Spring instead.,"I am glad to read all the reviews of this third part docudrama. I won't be purchasing The Last Full Measure. However, Civil War buffs like myself, should give a serious thought of purchasing two unknown gems entitled: Wicked Spring and Pharoah's Army. I bought both of them and I am not disapointed. They can be purchased here on Amazon."
1,Don't bother with this item,This DVD is the worst I have ever viewed. It is an inexpensdive copy of an old VHS tape which itself is bleached and faded. I strongly discourage anyone from buying it.
1,Glad I researched this item,I just watched Gods and Generals and at the end they mentioned Last Full Measure as being a 3rd part. Thanks to all the reviews I will not purchase this movie. I plan to watch Gettysburg next and I have several other Civil War movies I've seen but am viewing again. Even though I won't be watching it I had to give it one star before I could publish this review. Thanks again to everyone who wrote reviews.
1,Never made,I did some research it turns out the third part of the trilogie was never created. Bad box office reviews put the production on hold. This could have changed by now but the post I read was made in 2011.
2,last full measure,I love watching movies about the Civil war and reading books but this movie was a little disapointing I thought it have more about the war and the ending of it it is basily a Documentary of what happen and was not woth the money I paid for it.
2,Flaw in the design,"I am not happy with the product. Eventhough the height of the bag is 31"", the actual width is less than it appears. The reason being the belt inside the bag is located below than it should be normally towards the edge. And it is not strechable enough. So if one is buying for long term, there are better options available. Also if you want to return it than you have to pay for the return shipping charges and it is costly."
5,Excellent All A Around!,High quality reproduction of the episodes I've seen so far. Sound is clear too.Timely delvery and great price too!
5,the forgotten series,this was the series as a young boy along with combat that I could not wait for every week to watch. but they never ran it on tv again. now 50 some years later I finally got it on dvd.
1,You'll be very disapointed.,"Very bad. Stay Away Bad. Run Away Screaming in Pain Bad. Bad Bill! Baaaaaad!""The Man Who Got Thrown Out Of The Green Parrot"" is almost amusing, but it's not a song, it's spoken word and isn?t something I could listen to over and over again. I had a hard time listening to the entire CD. It was an effort. Ugh.The sound quality is a mess and frankly the music just isn't any good. Listening to this was not an enjoyable experience. This CD is now used as a drink coaster for guests that I don't like.I?ve been to Key West several times and was told that Bill Jabanoski?s music captures the ?real, local color?. I guess that could be true. That is to say if you think the local color is the same color of vomit expelled by a cancerous, flea infested stray dog slowly dying in the gutters along Duval Street.Yup. It?s that bad."
5,My mom loved it!,Product as described. Received certificate in box saying it was hand woven in North Carolina. My mom loved it! Received faster than expected.
1,The worst interpretations I have ever heard,"I have never heard anyone butcher Rachmaninoff's compositions as terribly as Idil Biret. After listening to her rendition of the Variations on a Theme of Corelli, (which was a colossal failure to say the least) I decided to give her another chance. What a mistake I made. Her phrasing on the first Nocturne absolutely destroys the music, as you can tell she has no ability whatsoever to phrase Romantic style music. The extremely choppy and staccato style is NOT how you play Rachmaninoff. Someone needs to take this woman's piano away from her. If you would like to listen to Rachmaninoff without getting a headache, I highly recommend Santiago Rodriguez, his interpretations are incredible."
1,No good!,I ordered this VHS tape and when it arrived the cover was correct but there was a completely different VHS tape inside. The seller should have checked the product before shipping out the item no matter how much it cost! The item was returned and as usual AMAZON did not waste anytime issuing me a refund.
5,An Oxford Scholar In The Clean Room,"So you think you've heard it all when it comes to the Valley, right? Well check this one out. With a fresh view and a scientist's eye, Christine Finn gives us new insight into a subject that has been done before. Frankly, I was sceptical, but I also had a minimum of six hours to wait at SFO (due to fog there and snow in Chicago). The author covers the valley like nobody I have ever read. Underlying a roaming set of essays is an almost palpable enthusiasm. And there is a romantic slant (in the classic sense) - she sees the valley as what it is as well as what it means to society. I recommend it."
2,get English-Lueck's Cultures@SiliconValley instead,"This is not the best book for insights about the Valley. As the other reviewers suggest, this book has a bit of a split personality. On the one hand, one has a stream of observational anecdotes about the Valley. All of the usual cliches are here: Fry's, Buck's Diner, the cherry stands, the 101 traffic jams. These read like someone is trying their hand at writing a confessional ethnographic tale, but without a theoretical argument to provide a central structure. On the other hand, one has a stream of stories about computer-as-artifact -- tales about the collectors, like Nathan Myhrvold, and the people who recycle computers, and so on. One gets the feeling that the author set out to write a book about the latter, found it a bit thin, and the editor suggested fleshing it out with some bubble-era backdrop."
3,For those of you buying for Gorilla Glass...,"I read in different forums that this product could remove scratches from Gorilla Glass on newer phones. DO NOT buy for this purpose! The scratches remained and the spot where I lightly rubbed is now duller in addition to being scratched. I'm sure this product is fine for its actual use, but not for purposes of fixing screen scratches!"
5,Undiscovered country,"Alfven was unknown to me until I took a chance with this album, and what a find it proved to be. This is a beautifully coloured musical landscape, lyrical, emotional and dramatic by turns. The major work here is the Swedish composer's 3rd Symphony, which is a joyful, sunlit piece. By contrast, the 'Legend of the Skerries' is much darker and more dramatic in tone. 'Dalecarlian Rhapsody' is a wonderfully evocative piece,with an undertone of sadness, yet full of rich inspiration. Credit is also due to the Scottish National Orchestra under Niklas Willen, who put in a sure-footed performance, while Naxos engineers deliver a beautifully clear acoustic. Well worth exploring."
5,Very light and well made. Optically excellent.,"These sunglasses are my 4th pair of Maui-Jim's. The company makes the best in the world in my opinion. This model is very light, optically as good as glass (I still can't find a description of the Evolution lens that indicates the material) and very comfortable to wear. Recommended."
2,"Looks Good, BIG DESIGN FLAWS!!","This knock box looks very nice and the price is reasonable. It even WORKS pretty good for a few months. Then the thing shows it's 'true colors'. As noted by other reviewers, the grometts and rubber bar sheath are entirely under designed. They simply don't hold up to regular use. I called the mfg (RSVP) and their customer no-svc people basically gave me an 'oh well, we sell the whole bar as a replacement unit' answer. So, if I wanted to spend $6 for $0.25 worth of tubing, I could go that route, but I won't be doing that. I won't be buying any products from RSVP in the future either if that is how they intend to stand behind them!"
1,Not a good value,"This knock box leaks around the metal seam, creating a nice brown spray every time the knock is used. The rubber tube covering the rod has split in two places. We have had it for less than 2 months."
5,Great Value!,"This is a great little knock box! Doesn't rattle (even if you hit it pretty hard), the post is removable, it's easy to clean, and mine doesn't have the white on the base that the other reviewer mentioned, it looks great! I heartily recommend this!"
2,Rubber deteriorated,"The rubber coating on the bar deteriorated and turned mushy. Other than that love the product. Still use, just louder when you beat against the bar to release grounds."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Simply capitalizing on the recent conspiracy genre. It really doesn't provide any solid information. Lots of innuendo, scarce factual research, and poor audio and video."
2,Mediocre,"Typical. An alright conspiracy movie with some connections which may notbe well known. It does nothing to shed light on what is not generally known. The actual length is about an hour, then there are credits and about 17 minutes of music with scenic shots.Might as well watch the Davinci Code. Even though it has more fiction incorporated, at least you will be entertained and still get the basic lowdown on how conspiracy's operate."
4,A Smile,This collection of ME's work brought a smile to my face. This little book is full of all of my old favorites. I am so happy to have found it.
5,Great Calender,This product is much bigger than I expected it to be for such a great price! It arrived quickly and in great condition. No problems so far!
5,Visually inspiring!,"For the last several years, I have used a M.E. wall calendar to keep track of our special events, appointments, meetings, etc. I love her colorful, whimsical, inspirational images and messages. I purchased the 2012 calendar from Amazon.com at a better price than directly from the Mary Engelbreit website. It's functional and motivational - love it!"
5,Beautiful and impressive artful pages!,"This compact book has a beautiful hardcover design and a frosted dust jacket. The author is creator of greeting cards plus more. This colorful artwork is wonderful as the pages reflect warm and witty insights. Just look at the minute details in each picture. Every little thing is in it's place, adding to the dimension. The author is truly a gifted artist. It is beautiful....MzRizz"
2,Cheap Paper,"Mary Englebreit used very cheap paper. This calendar should be called a ""floor""calendar as it won't stay on the nail because the weight of the calendar can't be held by a nail because the paper is so cheap. This is an expensive item and I was very disappointed."
4,tech info,this book is a very well documented engine rebiuld. it gives you the reader information on performance parts / parts interchangeability . also has a great specifications page has every torque spec available for every part of this engine. i would highly recomend this book..
4,Detailed,"This is a hard to find book, but I was lucky and located one at a local bookstore for half the cover price.I am not a mechanic, so some of the things in this book goes over my head. There are plenty of details in the book. Parts numbers, torque specifications, and clearences are all in here. The first chapter is even telling you want to look for in case you don't need to rebuild.If you are interested in the book, check with your local used bookstore first."
1,Worst bulbs ever owned,These bulbs are garbage to say the least. They aren't any better than the cheap halogens you can buy anywhere except for they appear whiter. They don't last very many hours at that. They start to dim very quickly after use.
1,complete crap,"I previously had some cheap Sylvanias that I bought off the shelf in autozone and they lasted almost two years. After replacing them with these Eurodezigns, I noticed that the light output was much dimmer, but they were slightly more blue. I supposed I could have lived with that but...They both died in LESS THAN A WEEK. The filament on one of them is OK, but the glass underneath it cracked. I can't say what happened to the filament on the other because the glass is cracked and the interior is filled with a smokey residue that obscures the filament. My guess is that the temperature was hotter than the glass could handle. I'm 100% positive that they are the same voltage and wattage as required by my vehicle.They're under ""warranty"" but you have to spend $7 plus shipping just to have them replaced, so you'll probably spend $12 to get a new set of $20 bulbs that won't last more than a few weeks.The moral of the story... stay far far away from anything made by Eurodezigns!"
3,"It works, but.....","I bought this temp station thinking it showed the inside and outside temp at the same time. It doesn't. It will cycle through giving the outside temp, then the inside temp and humidity. I don't care for it, but I do use it. I have 5 different temp stations in my home. This is my least favorite."
1,Undesirable,Haven't had much luck with wireless temperature units. This one isn't any better. Batteries do not last long; usually about 2 weeks.
4,WARNING! DO NOT LISTEN TO IN DARK OR BY YOURSELF!,This is some scary [stuff] we're talking about here! I made a huge mistake and listened to it in the dark (I almost [wet] my pants!) Marco Beltrami must be either messed up or really good to compose music like this. I gave it four stars because the length was horrible - I needed more! And so did everyone else!Pick up Scream 3 too! The best score of the series!
3,"OK cd, not enough music!!!","I just got the cd, and it has SOME of the music from the movie, but the entire length of the cd is only a half hour long and there is definetly not enough music on this cd. I wouldnt recomend buying this cd, go for something way scarier like the HALLOWEEN soundtrack!!"
3,"It's OK although parts of it came off the ""broken arrow"" cd!","This is a cd of the music that goes along with the movie ""Scream 2"". It OK but at times I felt as if I brought ""Broken Arrow"" all over again(the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer!). But if you're a fan of the series or just love the music you might like this cd! BTW, you also get the score to first ""Scream "" movie which in itself is very creepy/scary!"
4,Marco's Brilliant Masterpiece,"I have searched high and low for this CD, I can finally listen to most of the scores from the Scream and Scream 2 films. However, there were a few scores not included in the CD, and the guitar substitute for Dewey's Theme in Scream 2 just doesn't give as much justice. But alas, I can still watch the films for that. Overall, if you love suspenseful and meaningful scores, Marco has given a great performance."
1,"Nice try, Varese!","This has got to be the mother of all bad soundtrack releases! The score itself is fantastic. Why I gave this album 1 star is because it is a 2 scores on 1 CD, and its total is 30:00! This is not the fault of Varese Sarabande... Let's just hope an expanded release surfaces some day. It's doubtful, but one can still hope.I would suggest not picking this up unless you are a die hard fan of these scores. And the SCREAM 3 album ain't too much better either."
5,"It's fun, original, but a bit on the short side.","The scoring of these films is fantastic and now they're available to hear. My only complaint is that the C.D. could have more clips and a longer length on each song. For example Cici Creepies didn't have enough to it, they could have extended it to the original length of the scene. I highly reccomend the song; Love Turns Sour. It's the sound booth scene from Scream 2 and it's wonderful."
2,Disappointment. Not enough.,"When I first picked up this CD to see which tracks were on there, I was shocked to find none of the best songs from the movies weren't on there, like when Sidney gets attacked the first time in Scream 2, or when CiCi gets attacked in Scream 2. Many others from both films also. And none of the songs were long enough. (some didn't need to be on there at all) I was utterly shocked at how sorry this score soundtrack was. Hardly any of the best songs from either film were on this soundtrack. I actually liked the album to Scream 2 better."
5,Great representation of the movies,"This compilation disc of the scores from Scream and Scream 2 was a really good idea, because Marco Beltrami is a talented composer whose creepy music made the movies that much more effective. My only complaint is that some of the music from Scream 2 on this CD should've been in the actual film but wasn't."
3,Items fell apart,I purchased this set for a rotation I doing in PM&R. The Babinski hammer fell apart the very first day and the other items have progressively fell apart over the last month. I wish I would have just bought the pin wheel because it is the only item that is still intact.
1,Damages,"3 out of the four, three were damaged The buck hammer had rusted parts and the screws don't turn, one of the rubber heads was also loose, the Babinski hammer head won't fit as the screw don't go in and the taylor hammer rubber was warped and loose!!! all in all it was a shoddy set......Better to pay more and get a better quality set!! :("
2,Great software... just not enough material,"This software is actually really awesome. BUT, the amount of material that you get is just not worth the money you spend. I definitely learned a lot but I could have rented cds and software from the library (in fact, I did) for free and learned all of the information I learned from this software.If I had paid $30 or $40 I would be pretty satisfied. However, $80 is simply too much. To add insult to injury, most of the lessons that you pay for are available periodically for free on their website! AND, they send you a ton of junk mail, which I find incredibly annoying!I recommend that people check out what their local library has to offer, and check out the free lessons available on the Visual Link website, before purchasing this software. I also recommend the ""Learning Spanish with Michael Thomas"" software (don't buy it; try to borrow it or find it online); the format is really fun and he gives you a lot of useful tips that really increase your vocabulary."
4,Wife loves it,"I originally bought the Rosetta Stone package for my family to learn spanish. My wife did not care for it so much. A year later, I tried this product. My wife says it is so much better than Rosetta. I suppose it is different person to person. This one does seem to actually explain spanish in easy to understand terms. My wife loves it, and is actually motivated to learn. (anyone want a good barely used version of Rosetta Stone??)"
2,Pain in the CD,"This is not a bad program to begin the learning experience. If you want to always have to put the CD into the drive so you can use the program and your just starting this just might be for you. Also, if your want to pay more for each level (and the levels are not cheap) and you want to carry a ton of CD's with you, so you can use your laptop, this is your program. Personally I'll keep looking."
4,good read,"This book is about Mai, a girl who happens to be a very powerful psychokinetic. She doesn't think her abilities are a very big deal, although she is careful to hide them from others. Still, she uses them mainly to keep boredom at bay. Unfortunately, a secret organization is after her and other psychokinetics, so that they can use her for military purposes. Her dad, a man skilled at martial arts, as other ideas, however, and does his best to keep her safe.The artwork in this book was unexpected for me, much more realistic than anything I've seen in other manga works. However, it wasn't consistantly good artwork, and some of the characters tended to look odd, as another reviewer noted. The story itself was very riveting, and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read more about Mai, and I'm looking forward to the next volume."
2,"Small Picture Good, Big Picture Bad","The story is cool from page to page especially the non-fighting parts, but when they start bringing in the super-villains straight out of a marvel comic, it gets corny... And the whole world conspiracy and peace tribune in the alps, give me a break guys...I'm able to tolerate it mostly because the art is incredible. Dump this and read Sanctuary if you want a classic..."
4,This story was amazing. The quality of my volume was so good.,"This book, is so good, it concludes all loose plot points and ties from volume 2 this series has became one of my favorite series it has something for EVERYBODY. I wish they made manga like this a lot more. I wasn't around when this manga was being produced but I still find 90's art to be amazing and unique, I'm dragging on but even if you don't like ""old"" art style you should still give this series a try."
4,The man can write,"Great book by a man that is showing us just how multi-talented he is.When there's humour it's as dark as a pit of oblivion.Still not sure if it's ""fiction"" or whether he's writing his truth???"
5,"Deep, touching...Dark",An amazing testament to the talent that Henry Rollins possesses. Drove me to buy his other work.
4,Symphpny 2 a good normal performance,"If you got this as a set or part of the download, the 2nd is fine. A not too much off average performance. Some parts of it are very well done.I did not care for the Tempest suite. The second suite (with symphonies 6 and 7) is better recorded. The storm part here has some problems."
5,WOH!,"THIS ""COMPACT DISC"" IS PROBABLY ONE OF THEE !BEST! CDS IVE EVER BOUGHT! ""STOP"", ""NEW WAVE"", AND ""THRASH UNREAL"" ARE THE BEST SONGS ON THE ALBUM!!!!!1 THE CD IS GREAT IN THE FIRST HALF THEN, IT GETS A little BIT DIFFERENT BUT IT IS AN AMAZING AALBUMM I FIRST HEARD ""THRASH UNREAL"" ON THE RADIO AND IT IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BY THEM! ""AGAINST ME! AGAINST ME! AGAINST ME! AGAINST ME!...."""
2,We try so hard.,"What are we trying so hard to do?Trying to continue liking Against Me!, no matter what label they have chosen. ""Searching for a Former Clarity"" was a 60/40 mix of bad and good. All previous albums to that were nothing short of amazing. This CD is not bad music; it simply has nothing new, or old for that matter, to offer. It wouldn't be so bad if their previous albums weren't so good.I tried so hard.PS- The DVD that comes with it is not bad because they play some old with new, but in no way should make your wallet open."
1,Burnt out,"Against Me! should've maybe spent more time developing this album... but I think they're in a race against time now... they seem burnt out.Besides, how many songs can you write about being in a band? I swear to God, more than half of the songs Against Me! play are about them being in a band... a band that's different (listen to Cliche Guevera, Reinventing Axle Rose, Turn Those Clapping... etc.)Against Me! were so incredible... but typically bands that good are done after a few years at best. I just see it fading."
1,.....,"Keep it about the music? Alright lets do that. Well first off, the music itself, is boring. Ok against me were never the greatest musicians but their lyrics and emotion in their songs were amazing. Which leads to my next point, the lyrics, suck, and lead singer doesn't even seem to be into it like he was in other records.And against me is bringing their anarchist anthems up from the underground? Well thats fine but you cant be an anarchist band playing in a capatilist industry. And has anyone seen the video? It is MTV ready. Im sure it hasnt been on MTV but its just the beginning. Their next release's single could very well be on MTV. So to me - major label debut=sellout. Its that simple. I dont think there is anyone who could make me think differently about that. F*ck against me!"
5,New Age - New Direction,"True, many long-time Against Me! fans will probably miss the bands folk-punk roots. This is not a folk-punk album. It is a great album none the less. As a long time fan, I can forgive Tom and Co. for not wanting to release the same record over and over again.Electric-guitar driven, three chord punk music at its best. I love the new sound and everything Butch Vig has done on this record.Against Me!, like others before them, have grown and moved forward with their music. If your own taste has not moved in the same directions as theirs, so be it. But is it fair to demand that the band remains at the same place with you?And please, people... Can we all put the move to Sire behind us already? What about just keeping it about the music?"
2,What happened?,"I've really attempted to like this album. Its just not that good. I have loved Against Me about 4 years now, but their last two CDs have just not been up to par with their earlier work. I am not the kind of person who says major labels because I still like several bands who have moved to major labels. Against Me use to be energetic, fun and edgy folk-punk. Now it is pretty much radio-friendly trash. Many of the songs just have weak, cheesy lyrics with annoying poppy choruses. This album gets 2 stars from me because it does have moments where it isn't all that bad. I don't mind bands changing style, I actually like it a lot of the time, but this has been a change for the worse. If you are a die-hard fan of the band's earlier works, you will probably hate this album. If you are just being introduced to them for the first time, you may enjoy it."
5,Great CD!,I love this CD...I bought it for my husband but I love it too..it's full of fast moving in your face music..I recently saw this band live. I had never heard of them before but I enjoyed the music.
4,Pretty good,"You know everyone wants to hear and see something new. There isn't much that I haven't seen. I've even seen you in concert in Hattiesburg, MS around the time of hurricane katrina. It was a bad time in my life. I've had times of sobriety and times of drunkenness since then. The last year or so I've been clean again. I heard thrash a little late. I was always a fan, but I spent some time alone for a number of years, mainly in quiet. We're never really alone, but ya know some days it gets old. Glad to hear signs of recovery from ya'll. I'll have to get your latest one too, perhaps one day soon.~Andrew"
1,Rubbish,"I don't know what happened to these guys, their early work was fantastic, this is shockingly bad. I gave it one listen and was so utterly disappointed I threw it straight in the bin. If you've listened to their early work and loved it, don't waste your time and money, listening to them slide into something that is less than mediocre is rather painful, given the strength of their earlier work and the raw talent displayed by this band."
1,Absolute Junk,"I have never returned a CD but these 2 (Island of Dreams)are going back. Can't believe he is even in the market place. Those that like him are in a different world musically than I am. Listen to his music before you buy it.This is absolutely the worst CD I have ever purchased. I am in the process of returning it to Amazon.com. It has no real sound, the music is awful and you can't make out most of the words. If this guy is supposed to be the next Jimmy Bufffett (and I am a big fan of Jimmy's), then the music industry is in real trouble. I gave this CD a one star rating only because it was impossible to give no stars!"
2,Elevator Tripod,"Great design-poor execution. It's range of adjustments is impressive and at first setting it up it appeared to be well made. However it has a serious failing. The gear drive that runs the main column up and down (at least on this unit) has a very sloppy fit that causes the gears to skip and jam. It will work if assisted by pushing up on the column with your other hand and it will come down without jamming, but not up. If you need the height, I'd try another make.Update: I've used it now for a week. It's junk. When leveled, the rotating platform will not hold the setting. This makes it useless sighting more than one location. That makes it worth about $30-40."
3,"Stellar tripod... ...however, needs a level bubble on it.","This tripod works perfectly for my CST/Berger laser level... ...however, it's a good thing I got an automatically leveling laser level.... ...because this tripod does NOT have a level bubble on it, so you basically have to 'eye' it to plumb (or close thereto), then let your laser level do the rest."
2,This is just the TV show!,I was expecting this to be like other Barney videotapes but it's only an episode of the PBS television show. I'm not happy about paying money for what I could have taped off the air for free.
5,great item,Had purchases box set for my 6 yr old for his bday. was happy that all of the 3 box set came at one time and on time of its delivery date.
5,Great start to IPE theory,"For those interested in this subsection of IPE this is a great introductory textbook. It highlights the various systems under use and the last third focuses on very interesting phenomena that has been occurring recently, privatization. It is very clearly written and you do not need much background in economics to get a lot out of this book."
1,Skip It - Better get a book & a toy,"I got this as a Xmas present for my son, who was 16 months old at a time. It was not a success. My son just turned 2 years old and he played with this item maybe 3 times. It is useless. The wheels hardly spin, so he can't really use it as a toy. It's hard to open, the fastener is very tight, so he can't look at the pictures. The text is very, very small, so whenever I try to read it to him (in effort to get him more interested in this item, so that I feel like I get at least my money's worth out of it!) I get a headache.You would be better off buying a book about trains and a toy train for your child."
3,Simple,"This book has an interesting foundation for becoming a great book, I just don't think the author elaborated enough on each subject. Also, I already knew a lot of the things in the book, before i read it. I was disappointed, because I had expected a more advanced book. The book could be written for children under the age of 10 according to my opinion."
4,good book,"I bought this book for my children, and myself. I expected it to be a bit more, but my children found it to be informative. We found it to be a fun read, and the facts interesting. It made it fun to figure out where some of the characters and creatures were from.I recommend this book to everyone."
2,Save Your Money,"The other NSCAA DVDs are very helpful, but this one was a waste of money. The DVD teaches very little about soccer tactics. It's basically several college and national team coaches running drills. If you're looking to learn more about tactics, look elsewhere."
4,Jokari Soda Dispenser,I owned one these prior to purchasing these two. I think they are a good product but to pricey from Jokari. The price plus shipping made these a good value. The only problem with this is the hose comes coiled up and is not easily straightened. The product arrived promptly and as described.
4,Works as advertised,"Follow the instructions, and it works as advertised.Only took away 1 star due to the low stream that occurs after 1/2 bottle is used up, but that's really not the fault of the product I guess."
1,I expected it just to work as a dispenser so my kids could pour their drinks. the worst ever.,I expected it just to work as a dispenser so my kids could pour their drinks. the worst ever.The materials are very poor and cheap.
1,worst product ever,this product does not work at all. It has to be made in china because it is junk. Please don't waste your money because you will be sorry.
1,you get what you payed for,"it broke the next day , was so cheap i just put it in the trash without thinking about it,it is a nice ideea but it does not workdont buy it, just buy Cans of soda, always Fuzzy ,"
5,ethereally beautiful music,"If you play music for kids, they will love this story. My kids (10 and 12) perform for children using this book and it is always a hit. Great story, pictures, and especially the music."
4,Calista flockhart,"Don't think this is a Calista Flockhart movie but it was pretty hot! Checked IMDB and Flockhart did not show up on the list of people in the movie. It is what it is, though."
4,Fat Your Way Across the USA,"Cover up the bottom of the first letter of the title and you get a more accurate description of the kinds of places you'll be directed to by this book. Fried chicken, barbecue joints, pies and shakes are the types of cuisine most often referenced in the restaurant descriptions here. They're almost uniformly good and when my family traveled across the USA nine years ago we found it great fun to make detours away from our intended path to eat at the places listed in EYWATU.I wish that the authors had put balance in the listings, with low-calorie, vegetarian and similar restaurants included in some reasonable proportion. For what it is, though, it is well written and the food is evaluated fairly."
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE/TERRIBLE COMPANY,CHEAPLY MADE/PRICED TO HIGH FOR WHAT YOU GET/CONDESENDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.
2,Lickety Splitnot her best charater,"I don't know if she got tired of Callahn Garrity character or what...but this character is just a stiff...I wish that she would go back to her Callahan Garrity series as the characters in those books are just everyday joes, trying to do the best that they can do...like the rest of us...If she were to write another Callahan Garrity book,I would be the first in line to purchase it....MarshaBennett"
3,Not up to par.,I have read most of this author's books and was very disappointed in this one. It fell way short of her usual work. Her normal flow from character and places was to choppy and not as smooth as her other work. I had to continually go back and figure out where I was.
2,Not my style,It didn't hold my interest. I am a fan of Mary kay andrews and this was not the same quality as her other books.
3,Not that compelling,"I don't know if it is the name she writes under, or something else, but none of these characters or plots grabbed me, held onto me, or entertained me in the way that the author's Mary Kay Amdrews offerings do."
5,Awesome mystery read!,Awesome murder mystery that holds my interest. It's a really great book and has funny moments. If you are a fan of Mary Kay Andrews and enjoy reading mysterys you will love this book!
5,vICTORIAN AFRICAN BATTLE STUDY,"The first comprehensive account of the 2 campaigns under Sir Gerald Graham around Suakin in the Eastern Sudan during the Mahdi's revolt of 1884-85. Robson traces the landings, the build-up of British forces and the major battles of El Teb, Tamaii, Tofrek, Hashin and T'Hakul. Tunbridge Wells 1993, Spellmount, lst UK ed w/dj, 6 1/2 x 9 1/2, 228 pp, illus, maps, appendices, notes, bibliog, index."
5,Rhapsody in Blue,This is a great edition of this great piece of music. It one of the only full and true editions for the piano. It's a challenge that's for sure. But I'm very happy about my purchase.
1,Reluctant,"This was a cheap reproduction of the original ""The Humanoids"" plot that did not make sense. The original was much better--don't waste your money on this one."
1,Do Not buy this product at this PRICE!,"Do not buy! Although the product is very good the price here on Amazon is OUTRAGEOUS. The order I placed was for 12 boxes which came to about $3.66 per box. I was shopping in Wal Mart today (1-31-13) and decided to check their pricing, well to my amazement Wal Mart sells this item for $1.97 a box. Wow, did I get beat! Lots of great deal on Amazon but not for every product but I still have a hard time with the price vs. Wal Mart."
3,Limited Use and Life,"I thought this device was exactly what I needed to solve the flat 2 liter bottle dilemma. Well yes and no. First off, it fits well on all the bottles I tryed, but the stroke and volume of pumped air to fill the empty bottle became less and less effective. A 2 liter bottle has a surprisingly amount of volume and trying to pressurize it with this little thing takes awhile. Plus the wear and tear on the length of use broke it pretty quick.I finally made my own out of a tire valve glued to the top of a regular cap. I use a small bike pump to pressurize the bottle. I made my caps over a year ago and they still work better than the fizz-keeper that broke in about two months.Necessity is still the mother of invention."
3,Jokari Fizz Keeper Pump Cap,"This is a really great product, but it doesn't seem to last very long. I've gone through at least four to five of these per year because they stop holding pressure in the bottle. Wish they lasted longer."
5,works,"I've only tried one of the two, but it worked as advertised. I'm happy to use the two-liter bottles when I know they won't go flat with this gizmo affixed atop."
5,Works as intended,"Seems to do the job, it can get the pressure in the bottle up to the original levels and keep it that way. The next day my drink is still nice and carbonated."
4,Fizz Keeper Pump Caps,"We initially purchased these while vacationing in Maryland. I have reordered this item twice since being home. They do have a shelf life, and eventually the pump mechanism stops working. The theory is great. However, we would probably just depend on the original bottle cap in the future when this purchase is no longer working. In fact, one of the four I purchased did NOT hold the fizz; and it was brand new. That was disappointing! We still have two of the four we have not tried yet."
1,Useless,"This product is pretty much useless. After reading the great reviews I was tempted to buy the Fizz-Keeper, so finally I bought it. When it arrived, I put it into use immediately, only to be very disappointed by the results. The Fizz-Keeper did nothing to aid the soda into going flatter on me, and after I pumped it up, I could hear the hissing of the air escaping from this product. I also took a look at the back of the packaging and found out that it was made in 1987, maybe 22 years of being store somewhere away without any use made this product perform so bad? Who knows, maybe it was just the unit that I got that was so bad, but to me the results were clear that Fizz-Keeper did not do what it was promised to do."
5,Good product,"It is amazing to me that stores like Kroger, WalMart, etc., who sell zillions of two-liter soft drinks, do not have these fizz-keepers readily available for sale! Thank you, Amazon, for giving us this source for what should be in every household that uses 2-liter bottles."
5,Best invention ever,"I have had a Jokari Fizz-Keeper Pump Cap for years and when a member of my family said she wastes colas and soft drinks because she can't drink them before she loses the fizz, I told her about this cap. I decided I would search and see if they still were being sold. I was excited to see they were. I am happy and she is happy and now I am going to order more. It is not just good for 2 liter bottles but also the 20 oz.Thanks Amazon for having them available."
5,Fresh,"This is an excellent product. After pumping it, soda keeps as fresh as the day it was opened. We love it!"
1,Don't bother,"Absolute rubbish. It broke the second time I used it, the internal gasket came loose. It's just plastic and it's poorly manufactured."
1,You could put an eye out with this thing,"This worked fine until... it nearly put a hole in our kitchen ceiling. Thank goodness it didn't take out an eye. My husband was simply opening the bottle it was used on and the entire thing exploded off the bottle, hit the ceiling, leaving a dent in the sheetrock. The impact actually broke the flat top part off the pump portion. Needless to say, we won't be replacing this item. I'll take flat soda over blindness any day."
4,does the job,"If you are not expecting a product that keeps your soft drink exactly like the day you opened it, but rather simply extends the life--just as the product intends--then this is a good solution. My 2 liter of Coke Zero kept the carbonation/taste for at least 2-3 extra days-just enough time for me to finish without having to suffer a flat glass at the end. I followed the other woman's review on number of pumps per amount of soda left which worked well. The only slight issue I have is how hard it is to screw the top off once it's in use. (I may be tightening it too much to begin with though.) For the price, it's worth a go as long as you keep your expectations in check. I'm ordering another for a gift so that says something..."
2,not too good,"The device pumps so little air it takes a good while to pump, worse still the valve appears to not hold the pressure well."
3,Defective and Broke Apart,"As soon as the Fizz-Keeper arrived from Amazon, I gave it a try.Immediately I noticed how difficult it was to move the plunger up and down - it should move easily.I put it on a 2 liter bottle I had in the fridge, started to pump, and the cap rips off.The cap is attached with a small plastic ""pin"" inside the tube.I could epoxy the cap back on, but quickly concluded that the plunger should pull up very easily. It's not pumping in air on the up pull - so it shouldn't have so much resistance.I've got a pump for my air mattresses which is a cheap piece of plastic and it works great and plunges easily.The broken item was returned to Amazon. Not sure if I'll order another since many other reviewers have stated the Fizz-Saver doesn't last long.I can see that."
1,Not a quality product. Cost too much.,"Over the years I have tried two of these. The first one died after a month of normal use ( 1 two liter bottle per week ). I bought one a year ago thinking the quality of this product has improved, but it also died. This time after two weeks. I love the concept, but I would not buy this product. Both times I bought the item, I felt the price of it was too much, but to me it was worth it if it lasted. They did not. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't buy this,"I used it once and it broke. Not just broke as in didn't work. Broke as in I went to remove the thing from the soda bottle and it exploded... sending a hard plastic projectile whizzing past my face and leaving a dent in my ceiling. I swear, to this day I don't know how I didn't lose an eye."
3,Mostly awesome,"We bought one of these years ago and love it. We decided to get a few more for those times when you've got a few 2 liters in the fridge. When they work they're great and the really do keep your soda fizzy. We just bought two a few weeks ago and they seem to be really stiff and hard to push. One of them actually broke and won't work anymore. The other one still works, but it's much harder than the one we've had for years. I'm not sure if that batch was defective or something. So, they're usually awesome, but for some reason these ones aren't working perfectly."
3,Works sometimes.,It is ok. This works to keep the fizz in most of the time but is not a cure all. I still use it if I have a bottle that I know will be sitting for a few days. Oth than that this the pump by itself makes an amusing tooting sound that the kids get a kick out of. LOL!!!
5,This is the way to go!,I bought another product for the same reason. This one beat the comparison. Pulls out the dead air in the bottles and keeps beverage from going flat! WINNER!
2,Broke after the first use,"My mother in law has used one of these for years, the same one in fact for about 15 years. I am sure hers wore out 13-14 years ago. I purchased 2 for her as we joke about this quite a bit and the first one broke after the first use. The second is holding up well."
3,Cool but sticks down into the soda,Have to drink quite a bit of soda out of the two liter so that the cap doesn't stick into the soda.
1,Works well until it breaks - and they always break,"I've owned four or five of these, and they work wonderfully for a few weeks or so. Then, inevitably they'll break. They either start leaking (you can hear the air escaping) or they mechanism will stop working, or snap, or stop pumping, or something. I even purchased a different model from the same company with a rubber squeeze-ball on the top, and after three uses it stopped holding air in.Wonderful concept, but horrible quality."
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,The manufacture of this does not respond to questions regarding this product and other non working items. I would not recommend any of there products. This is NOT Amazon's fault.Pat Ryan
2,dangerous,"do yourself a favor, do NOT buy this one, it is dangerousit does work but...i left it on too long (apparently) and it rocketed off and dented the ceiling (narrowly missing my face)i ordered 2, the other one never worked at allinstead, get the the pump and pour (with a ball on a hinge) works great and is easier to use (and not as deadly)"
1,Shame it doesn't work.,"Tragically it is true, if you open and reclose a bottle a few times and repump every time, it keeps the air pressure in the bottle up, but since the partial pressure of CO2 is different then air, the CO2 will still come out of solution, e.g.... your pop will go flat. I bought one on a bet, and tested it in hopes of disproving the myth. Oh well.For 3$, enjoy the bubbly placebo!"
1,Fizz-Loser,"Nice concept, but doesn't work. Sure, the bottle will hiss like a fresh bottle each time you open it...but if anything it will make the soda go flat even faster. The only way this would work is if you pump in pure CO2 that is equal to or greater than the amount of CO2 in the soda. Refer to Dalton's Law on gas partial pressures. You're better off squeezing all of the air space out of the bottle and capping it than pumping the bottle full of air. If this is keeping your bottle of soda from going flat, then you're drinking the soda too fast."
2,"outrageous, insane and confusing","Courtesy of A Romance ReviewBreaking All The Rules, book 5 of the Paradise Beach, Florida series of Sue Civil-Brown (aka Rachel Lee) brings you another romantic comedy or better yet, a soap opera with humour and fun. Anything could happen on this island with Mary Todd in residence and running the show. Readers will either hate or love this book because of the outrageous, insane and confusing plots and incidents. The earlier books in the series are Letting Loose, Chasing Rainbow, Catching Kelly, Next Stop, Paradise. If you like to try this series, the best way is to read them in sequence."
3,Couldn't get into this one.,"I normally enjoy all of Ms. Civil-Brown's books. NEXT STOP, PARADISE was cute with the giant egg on the beach. However, I don't feel the same about this one. Maybe I was just having a bad day, but I ended up scanning through to the end. Not a good sign with me."
4,A useful text for computer scientists,"Most existing UI/HCI books ignore the details on how to implement user interfaces and are thus inappropriate for courses in many computer science departments. Olsen's book steps into this vacuum and provides a text that covers how to go about determining the tasks an interface should support as well as how to implement the resulting design. The bulk of the book is on the implementation side and thus students will also come to understand how toolkits, which practitioners generally use, work internally.This text can be used in a quarter long course on UI development or in a more comprehensive semester long HCI course when supplemented with additional material on human abilities, design, and evaluation. We have found this book quite valuable in three offerings of our course on UI Design, Prototyping, and Evaluation here in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley."
4,Not funny enough,"I took an undergraduate user interface class from Dr. Olsen. May have even got an A in it. He has a good sense of humor in real life. I think the book would be better if it incorporated more of his personality.The book is well written and will help you understand how to develop user interfaces (as the title implies). I enjoyed reading it and still refer back to it from time to time. It's not an advanced book (nor is it a ""for dummies"" book), but it gives you a foundation for understanding topics like computer graphics, design patterns (in particular MVC), and graphics toolkits like Swing. It has added to the collection of skills that helped me get my current job, so how can I not love it?"
5,A bygone time,"Caveat: I'm a distant relative of the author Roy Higby. My great grandmother worked as a cook at a similar resort in Iron Forge, NY, and I grew listening to her tell similar stories.It was a very sad read for me. Roy's recollections of a bygone time, with the present knowledge that there was nothing he could do to slow or reverse the coming changes, tugged at my own sensibilities. Many of us have 'stories' in the family or in the community about 'the way things were.' Almost all of the legendary Adirondack resorts are gone now, and we are poorer for it.This is a wonderful narrative, full with emotion, love, and care. This is a great book for the cottage or cabin bookshelf, and for those of you who wish to remember days gone by."
2,Brush with BDSM,"Pita's Brush with Love is an OK book, and it begins out kind of sexy in a forbidden way, where the main character, Miranda discovers a new side of her sexuality. Miranda is an artist's model, and meets Michael, an artist. They come together and explore this discovered side of Miranda, her intrigue with the more forbidden aspects of love, shall we say. Again, some scenes are sexy but as it grows deeper into spankings and whippings, I lost interest. I'm not into the idea of being spanked or whipped, so it's basically not my taste. The story isn't bad, though, but I have to get persnickety and complain about all the typos and bad grammar in the book. (Yes, I'm an English major). I see the odd typo in many books, and I don't like it, but I understand that mistakes happen and sometimes get overlooked, but there were just so many errors here it was distracting. To me it just came across as careless and a turnoff."
2,Huuuu,"I've been using for about 1 year and I haven't noticed any difference, so I think I must have wasted my money."
2,Size small not an 8,Size small was smaller than normal size small.item worn before I saw it on my grandson.Having to give more words to get this printed is ridiculous.
4,Mom and son happy,I recently bought online this green tshirt for my 5 year old son. He loves video games he plays like he is Luigi from Mario Bros. So I was very excited that I was able to find this item online in amazon.com because I went to every store in every mall looking for this simple tshirt. Anyways my son was very pleased when he got it. Now he definitely has the Luigi look. Thanks Amazon!!
3,Amazing Christmas for Christians,"Upon my first viewing and review, I basically panned this video. Since then, I have watched it many times over and have decided that this is one of Perry's finest Christmas specials. If you are a Christian or a Catholic (like Perry), you will find the hairs on your arms standing up. You can tell Perry feels the same way. This is how Christmas started and Perry takes you there in a way that no other could. Buy this video if you can - it's worth it! This IS Christmas!"
2,Could be better!,Wonderful to have Perry in your living room again at Christmas time but unfortunately this video falls short. There isn't alot of Christmas-y material in it and I was left disappointed. Only die-hard Como fans will truly enjoy this video!
1,Wrong product Description,The tail light lens in this case is described as a Right Hand lens but is in fact a left hand lens. I had to wait another week ( 2 day shipping ??) to receive the correct lens Wesbar 003372 but when received it had a giant crack through the middle due to poor packaging. The 003372 is described as a Left Hand lens but is in fact a right hand lens.
4,"A composer first, guitarist second","Some jazz musicians stand by ""art for art sake"". What they play can only be enjoyed by musicians and critics. At the other end, there is a ""smooth"" jazz, which is listenable by general public but lack the quality of jazz. In the liner notes, Anthony mentioned that he wanted people to enjoy the songs, the melody. This CD is enjoyable as Anthony managed to reach his goal. The presence of Benny Wallace made the session stronger."
3,Less is not more,"I ordered this bed cap set based on the photo that showed both bed and Tailgate caps. I was disappointed to find I only received bed caps. the product does fit well and looks good, just no tailgate cap."
4,"Solid, very easy read with current information","This book is part of Barnes & Noble's Health Basics Series. The book is well laid out with helpful resources, web links and an Ask the Expert question and answer page for each section. Well worth the purchase."
1,Disappointment,We are very disappointed in this product and cannot recommend it to others. We are also disappointed in Lacrosse Technology's customer service. An email to their service department has brought complete silence and a check on their website claims they are experiencing 'heavier than usual' requests for help. The only way we've been able to clear the memory on the thermometer is to remove the batteries - every night. I won't be buying another Lacrosse Tech product again.
1,Don't Buy POS,3 months and it dies. The outdoor sensor is not waterproof as stated in the description.
5,Another good book from Mary!!,"Get this book!!! I've already started rereading this book in preparation for the upcoming holidays. Since money's going to be tight this year, I've already gotten ideas from this book and started getting things ready. If you ever thought Christmas was too commercialized and want to downsize, read this book!!! It's done wonders for my attitude - and my budget, for that matter."
5,Una banda que queda en la historia,"Los abuelos, asi como Andres calamaro es una banda que influye directamente en el rock argentino, dando nuestras raices del rock nacional. Unos grandes !"
5,About Time,"Finally someone was smart enough to release Batdorf&Rodney on CD The songs on this disc are all great classics,And the CD sounds amazing.Now if Batdorf&Rodneys second CD Of The Shelf would be released,All of us Batdorf&Rodney fans could rejoice in the knowledge that the entire catalog is out there.Fot now all we can do is wait,And enjoy the two disc that are out now."
1,This is not Batdorf and Rodney!!!!!!,Come on Amazon! Will the real Batdorf and Rodney please stand up!
4,books,The books were hard to find and I was happy to be able to find them on Amazon for sale at a reasonable price.
4,Love is Grand,If you have ever loved an animal you will love thisbook. Written with a sensitivity that tells ofa real personal involvement. Humorous and reallyentertaining!
4,Sewing,"I used them on layered cotton muslin and they worked well. Although they don't have a perfect razor edge like the Fiskars Cushion Grip 300 Series Scissors, Left/Right Hand, Bent, 8 Inches, 3.25-Inch Cut (1237567797). There may have been one or 2 tiny nicks, but it didn't cause any problem when I cut the fabric-it didn't stop or skew the fabric.The cushion grip could be a bit more cushiony.Mine were clean and untarnished."
1,Don't bother with these,"The first pair that I received were very tarnished. The replacement product was less so, but was covered in a black dust. I kept wiping the blades and finding black dust on the tissue. Thanks to great Amazon customer service, I was able to return them for a full refund. Don't bother buying these scissors."
4,Good Quality and Service,"The memory card arrived in the time specified, no shipping charge, and was packed well for the trip. I am pleased with the order!"
1,Oxford Garden Designs Chadwick Collection Sidechair,"We ordered 4 of these chairs, and two had legs that were uneven!!! When we applied the recommended teak oil on the first chair, we found about twenty areas on the seat and one on the back where wood putty had been applied. The stain made these spots JUMP out at you--and now that they are put together, it is too late to return. The only saving grace is that we bought cushions to cover the seat but that won't help the back. I would never purchase anything this large that is difficult to return again!! What a major disappointment."
2,disappointed,For what this program does it is very over priced. It may help with some writers block but does not help you organize your plot and how characters interact. It gives you a list of verbs or adjectives and that's about it. Minimal word processing ability
1,THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY,I want to send this back! It is super overpriced for what it does... NOTHING!I should have know better than let someone else get this for me! This software does not do anything! I wanted something to help me organized everything. But the only thing this software seems to do is just build a characters characteristics. that is all. You can't even write separate chapters or anything like that. DO NOT BUY THIS!
2,difficult to read the time,I did not like this watch. It is very difficult to read the time because the stained glass design runs all over the face.
5,Very nice,I get compliments on this watch all the time even though I have other watches that cost considerably more
2,Chinese package,This watch have to be gift. On the picture package looks so good. On the real looks like chinese wholesale.
4,Attractive,"It's detailed, elegant and artistic. I love wearing it and have not seen another watch like it. It's slightly heavier and slightly larger than I thought it would be but I still enjoy wearing it."
4,Classy Watch,This watch is both aesthetically pleasing to look at and is a useful time piece. It's slim design and unique face make for a wonderful gift and daily functional use.
3,Bulova Willits Window,This quite unique and very cheap. I like the two level dial artwork. My only complaint is the strap is slack. I suggest installing a nice alligator strap.
1,Nicht sehr gut,"I was frustrated with this book because it lacked explanation for important grammatical concepts. I was in a class room and still found it difficult to use this book. My teacher, a native German speaker, was continuously pointing out flaws/mistakes."
3,Good with supplemental instuction,"I had a fantastic German instructor who made the department's required text of Na Klar workable. However, on your own, it is useless. Also, this text is full of visual fluff and lacks a lot of textual instruction -- I never could use this book for individual studying."
2,Bad experience,"This is not a textbook you will want to learn a foreign language from. It lacks a decent amount of good examples when introducing a new concept and is almost like the workbook, 75% of the chapter seems like a big exercise. I was very annoyed by this book."
2,Not very good,"Too overpriced, doesnt do a very good job of teaching at all even in a classroom setting. Half of the excercises are just guesswork because explanations in the book are minimum to non-existant. This book was definitely not worth the price. Probably not even worth free."
1,item with expiration date that has expired,"I received my order that its expiration date has expired. This item is a food item and if the expiration date has expired, it should NOT be sent to the customers. It would cost me just as much to return the item than what I had initially paid for - the item and the shipping charges. Food products that has an expiration date should be checked properly before sending out to customers. I find this a ""ripped off""."
4,cake decorations,The product was just as described. We have no shops in our area that sell items like this. Postage was a little high. Was impressed by the biodegradible packing 'peanuts'.
3,Ehh..its okay.,"I don't have much to say on this product- except for the fact that I bought it for a ""just in case I need it for a cake"". But then I realized real quickly that I can use one cell for the whole bottom trim of a cake, I wouldn't be albe to use more sprinkles if i wanted to on another cake. There's just not enough sprinkles in there. But its great for cupcakes and the sprinkles look cute- I just wish the cells were bigger to hold more sprinkles."
4,PS3 Controller,Its a great controller and has a good amount of battery life.I'd go with he dual shock though its more realistic.
4,PS3 Wireless in a Nutshell,"I'll make this short and sweet.PROS: It's wireless (duh...). As well, this controller is light, and fits my hands well. The PS button is very convenient for switching ON/OFF your Playstation, and the right/left triggers are great for someone like myself who is a racing fan (use for throttle/braking). Finally, the unit seems to hold a charge quite well.CONS: No included charger base, and some will miss the ""rumble"" feature, although I found it more annoying (even useless) for the types of games I play (mainly racing)."
5,"Great controller, no problems yet.","I've tried a few of the knock-offs, and you get what you pay for. I paid $37.99 at Amazon for the Sixaxis controller, and love it. I was looking for another controller so we could play 2 player games (I've had my PS3 for about 2 months now), and found this to be the best one out there."
5,Nice Remote,Picked one up used on Amazon and it looked better than my current remote. Shipping was fast too!
3,Sony...bring back Dual Shock,I dont know why Sony ever decided to drop the Dual-shock for these. These controllers feel like a toy instead. Do yourself a favor and buy the import PS3 DualShock controllers from Ebay instead.
4,wow!!,"when you buy a PS3 you expect something out of this world.and belive me, you`ll not be disappointed.but we need to talk about the sixaxis controls.the name is cool, but they are basically the same contols for ps2but i love the wireless function.they are great control and i like them a lot. they are light, they don`t come with vibrate function. and if you buy one new it doesn`t come with the usb cable."
2,"Good controller, but dies in 2 years or less","I had 2 of these controllers for just under 2 years and this past weekend, both of them went dead.... not dead as in plug them in to charge them, but dead as in that's it, they are nothing more than paper weights at this point. So of course since the 1 year warranty was up, I had to replace them. It would be nice if they would make them a little more durable and extend the battery life, or at least sell replacement batteries for like $15 or so. Is that so much to ask Sony???"
5,"What to say, right?","Playing Fight Night Round 3 by yourself is not fun, so you're forced to buy a second controller. The only thing that I don't understand is why it doesn't come with a usb cable."
2,Too light and no rumble. Six axis is not ready for prime time.,"This controller seems like it was rushed to production. The sixaxis is not well implemented in the games and the rumble is completely missing because of patent issues which are now resolved. Use it as a cheap extra controller, but definitely get the rumble controller for personal use."
2,not wireless for long,"The idea of no more wires was exciting to me when I got my new consoles. I got my ps3 in Jan and both of the ""wireless"" controllers batteries are having a hard time holding a charge. The battery in the ps3 controller is not replacable like the xbox360. When the battery loses its charge you either have to keep it wired to the ps3 so it will work or you have to buy a new $50 cotroller. You really have no other choice at this point but be aware. Also the L1 L2 R1 R2 buttons are flimsey and very close together. I dont have very large hands but after a few hours I start to cramp."
1,This isn't a game?,"I mean, it's a great game controller. Works great with my bluetooth link to my computer, using it to play various emulated games. But Amazon is asking me how much fun this game is, and how I'd rate it overall. And being as it's not much of a game in and of itself, I'm going with the lowest rating."
2,Just like the PS2 Controller...,"As I said in the title, this controller is almost identicle to the ps2 controller. I find that this greatly diminishes the gameplay of the PS3. It does not even rumble! However this controller may be half the weight of a ps2 controller, I would still not recommend it."
5,"Really cool, very intuitive.","I've been flinging my controller all over the place since the 8-bit Nintendo, finally, it actually does something!"
4,Does the job,"A little too light for my taste. I would like to see it a little heavier so I know I have something in my hands. Works as designed, like it much better than the x-box controllers for quick action/repsonse on screen.They should include two with every system!!"
3,Cable Not Included,Sony did a great job with the controller. I bought a second controller so my fiancé and I could play together. Sony does not include a USB cable with the controller! I can't charge two controllers with one cable if my fiancé and I are playing at the same time. I'm going to have to buy another USB cable.
3,You're kidding right?!,"$[...]for a controller is bad enough, but Sony can't even include a $[...] usb cord?!! Oh wait, of course not, because it's actually a $[...] extra.Ridiculous greed and nothing but."
1,in ba d conditions,I got this controler from amazon and a in the specifications said that was in perfect conditions.....lie....the analog stick it does not work at all......and i pay like 37 dollars for it....not sheap at all....well bad experience
2,50$ CONTROLER NEEDS TO COME W/ USB CABLE!!!,Don't Like the fact that it costs 50$ and you also have to pay an aditional 10$ just to get the usb cable to use it. I think that if it costs that much it should come with the cable!!!!
3,What? No cable?,"Works fine. But as my second controller, I was disappointed that it didn't come with a USB cable to recharge it. So much for (easily) charging both controlelrs at once."
1,controller dont work anymore.,"I tried the controller a couple months ago and realized I had to power up the controller longer. But for the last couple of months I've been using my other controller during one player mode matches. Finally when I invited a couple of friends over to join two player mode games, I realized my controller doesn't work. Knowing that ps3 controllers are suppose to last for a while not a couple of months. I tried charging it for a while but still no respondent. A waste of money I think."
5,PS3 wireless controller,"It was perfectly new, and not to mention cheaper than the stores! A must if you are into gaming on the ps3."
3,To rumble or not to rumble?,"I have two of these controllers as my PS3 60gb came included with an extra for free, but I have also purchased two new DUAL SHOCK 3 contollers which look like this one, but they have RUMBLE which these do not. The regular SIXAXIS will be replaced soon by the DS3. I prefer to have the rumble option on the controller and the tilt contol and wireless are great."
3,Too Light,"Basically the same controller we've seen from Sony for the last two generations, except wireless and much much lighter. The lack of weight is definitely something I needed to get used to. I am used to the solid feel of the 360 controller. Hopefully the Dual Shock versions solves this issue."
3,All good except the triggers,"Sony really should have taken a look at how well the Xbox 360 controller triggers work. Usually in any racing game, you will want to use the triggers for gas & brake, but these will have your hands cramping up after a while, they are just oddly shaped and awkward to use."
3,Good & bad,"The controller works great - I love that it's wireless, comfortable, and light.The bad - I bought 4 of these 4 months ago when I bought the PS3 - two stopped working properly within two months, and a 3rd one is starting to stick on one of the movement joysticks.Fortunately, Sony is good about honoring the warranty.I had tried a different brand and got a lot of grief from the kids that they didn't play as well!"
2,Lightweight... But,This controller is very lightweight but it doesn't affect the game as must as the rumble (vibration). Great if you don't care about vibration. DO NOT get if you play Call Of Duty or similar games or it will affect your game.
3,nice controller but.......,The standard wireless controller is a great thing. one problem it doesnt come with a charging link. I was able to dig out some old usb cord i had so that i could charge both of my controllers when i got my ps3. In my opinion they should have included a charge link with the controller. Its just the right thing to do for the loyal playstation followers.
3,"works. . .but other than that, not so good","This controller is lightweight, wireless, and has a wonderful battery life but does not have a rumble feature (why it is so light) which I find to be quite irritating, especially when playing an FPS. It also has a tilt feature which I happen to HATE. It's just a Wii ripoff and is extremely annoying and fails to add anything to the gaming ""experience"" as a whole. For example, I'm playing Call Of Duty 3 and am trying to prepare a bomb for detonation with hundreds of bullets wizzing around my head, but in order to do this seemingly simple task I must shake this stupid controller a number of times before I get killed. When attempting to improve the game it only succeeds in exacerbating tough situation. Mediocre on its own but so bad in comparison to the Dual Shock controller of the PS2."
2,"Needs dual shock, and ergonomic redesign","I grew up on PS2, and am very accustom the controller. These ones that have dual shock removed, leave you always wishing there was rumble. Having played with controllers that rumble for over 5 years, not having it is noticeable, even if having it isn't. After playing Xbox 36o since its release (and the PS3 since its), I also long for a more ergonomic design (like the 360 controller, which is amazing), rather than holding a brick with buttons and a few curves. As far as sixaxis, I've never used it, it's simply lame and childsplay to me."
3,Buy new controllers,I wanted to get 2 controllers; but because they are a bit expensive I got them used.That was a bad idea. It is better to get them new. They come in bad shape. It is like used game.Controls get abused.
5,Better than the 360 remote..,"I've had a while to use this on the PS3, and it's a really nice layout. I just wish Sony felt would have been nice enough to give us two with a PS3!"
4,IS THIS NECESSARY?,"I don't think there's a single bad thing I can say about this controller. Well ok, one thing... Bring back the dual shock! Great product! ultra comfort! Must buy!"
4,Great PS3 controller,"This is the standard PS3 controller, but it works great! The battery life is truly exceptional and never gives out on me in the middle of a game. There is no rumble pack in the new generation of PS3 controllers, but I think that is a good thing because battery life increases significantly."
4,"lightweight, comfortable and durable",This is a great lightweight controller that fits comfortably in the hand. Wireless technology works well. Controller is pretty durable and having a wireless is nice with no wires to wear out or trip folks up.
3,Not in perfect condition,"The controller I received was not in perfect condition. One of the right trigger buttons was permanently pushed in, thus making some games extremely difficult if not impossible to play. I remedied the problem, however, by taking it apart and readjusting the button. Works fine now."
4,Game Controller,"Game Controller did not come with cable to connect to PS3 or charge it, that is the only bad thing I can say about this product."
5,Great remote,"It's very lightweight and feels good in my hands. You don't get tired from holding it for extended periods of time, whereas other heavier remotes may do this.Both of my controllers are messing up slightly though. One of them steers off to the left every so often, so its very annoying to play any kind of game where you have to have precise movements. I have dropped them many times though, so that is probly the cause.This one does not have any rumble feature however, and I will purchase the new controller with rumble as soon as it comes out in the US."
4,Old but reliable,"This controller continues to be a favorite; however, the new dual shock with the much desired rumble feature is the one to get."
3,It Gets the Job Done,"This controller was doomed from the start with no Dual Shock. Now that there is a Dual Shock version I highly suggest you get that instead.However that being said I'm pretty happy with the controller, it is very lightweight and it gets the job done.The whole 6 axis thing is a total gimmick though, I hate it when games use the feature."
4,Good but still lacking,"There's a lot of good about this controller. The sixaxis feature is intriguing, the PS3 button lets you access the menu, power on/off etc but once you get the Dual Shock 3 controller then go back and play with this again, you'll have a bit of an empty feeling. The good news is that the DS3 release means the price is dropping on this controller. The bad news is no charge cable is included, so you might need to buy another one. BTW, you don't have to spend $12 at Best Circuit, google ""USB mini B cable"", and you can pick one up for a song and dance."
2,"No Rumble, No Fun","Without the rumble function, it's a much more lighter controller. However, it lost it's true potential as a video game console's fun..."
5,This is a pretty cool,This controller by Sony is pretty cool.Though I am eagerly waiting for Dual Shock3 :)
1,"Broken, faulty product, and terrible service","I received my order rather quickly, which I was of course, very pleased about. Unfortunately, the supposedly ""like new"" Controller/Joystick was both beat up looking and broken. We would have accepted the fact that it didn't look ""like new"" if only it had worked-but it didn't! We of course wrote back to the supplier, ""Quick Buys"", who not only did not attempt to remedy the problem, they never even reponded back to my email. I hope this reveiw will prompt them to act by doing the right thing and refunding my money, had they done that I could at least say they were a decent supplier to deal with even/especially if something goes wrong. Not the case here. Terrible service!! Stay far away!!"
3,Works Very well for mopst gaming,Does whatever its supposed to.No better one for the PS3.........can be improved upon in many ways but we will have to wait
5,A must have for multiple players,"I don't know why a PS3 remote would need a review. It is a must have if you are playing with multiple players on any game. It is light weight, which is good and has easy controls. You can always use it when you are watching your DVD's on the PS3. Have not had any problems and we've had the PS3 since June 2007."
2,GO BUY A DUALSHOCK!,"plain and simple it works and it is well worth it, rumble out beginning of next year, expect a price drop.UPDATE: THE DS3 IS OUT, HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE, GO GET THAT. The build quality is much better than the sixaxis, and the DS3 does both motion as well as rumble."
3,PS3 controller could have been better,"PROS: (1) Similarity to previous controller and ease of use. (2) Lightweight yet still incorporates an excellent battery life. (3) Sixaxis works surprising well, ONCE you get it down. (4) Wireless function doesn't auto-shutoff or give ""1/2 power"" warnings like the Xbox 360.CONS: (1) Close to $45 (depending on retailer) is outrageous. (2) If purchased seperately, charging/sensing cable does not come with the controller. (3) Charging/sensing cable is approx. three feet (or 1m) long. (4) The reason I say chaging and SENSING cable is because if you want to play with more than one controller they all must be plugged and 'sensed' by the PS3 for them to be activated, whereas on the Xbox 360 you just hold the button on the controller and the console sense buttons down simultaneously."
3,"Not up to the previous two, but still nice","On the cusp of abandoning TV fame for the movies, Connie's selection of songs here reflects a new, mature mood, and while it's not a stiff, it's just a touch on the bland side. ""Because You're Mine"" is lovely, ""Hajji Baba"" is lively, but ""Dancing in the Dark"", ""Long Hot Summer"" and several others are interchangeable. Connie's still sounding wonderful, but her best songs are on ""Cricket"" and ""Conchetta"". B-"
5,Lovely,"With a teeny-tiny voice Connie Stevens through careful planning, attention to detail and sheer force of personality compiled a string of impressive albums for Warner Brothers. This was the best, recorded in Germany with a large orchestra. The eclectic song list reflects Stevens' own keen awareness of popular music and fondness for odd, neglected songs. The album is beautiful and enchanting start to finish. And Stevens is a sensitive and versatile singer, making the most of what is little more than a whisper. This album was very popular and justly so. It hasn't dated a bit and still sounds fresh and intriguing."
2,2 For The Quality Of The Vamps,"As a lover of horror i knew from the title this one would be a cheezer but with Paul Naschy i figured it might be not so bad. Wrong! The bad acting and bad lines were good times to grab a snack in between lesbian love scenes. The babes are quality and there are lots of them but thats about all. Naschy was around from time to time but did little to improve this grade C attempt. If you want porn buy porn, if you want a vampire movie try something else. Mystery Science Theatre has shown and made fun of much better movies than this."
3,HORROR LEGEND?. . . BITE YOUR TONGUE. [:-),"Well, I've never been a serious fan of ""Dracula"" movies, except when there were lots of babes running around in flimsy veils etc. [:-) Lately, I had been searching for more exposure of the dark haired beauty ""Kennedy Johnston"" and when I saw her listed as staring in this production, I went for it. The opening scene of ""Orgy of Blood"" made the purchase worth while for me. After that, I did find her in a pool with another dark haired sweetie but that did it for me.Finally watched and listened to comments about the production. They were very interesting, Dracula &/or (Paul Naschy) fans WILL enjoy the commentary and background information. Watch it with a friend. [:-\"
1,This movie sucks (not in a good way),"The only reason the film even gets one star is due to the performance of Paul Naschy. He is the only individual who appears in this film who even deserves to be called an actor.I purchased this film expecting something impressive, since I am a huge Naschy fan. Unfortunately, even the presence of one of my all-time favorite horror actors/directors could not polish this turd enough to make it shine.I truly hope and pray that Tomb of the Werewolf, Naschy's second US film, lives up to the legend. Unless you are a horny teenager looking for a movie filled with plenty of T&A;, you will be very disappointed with this film."
1,Pie in the Sky with no technical backup - worthless,"My title says it all. This is one of those ""hand wave across the map"" kind of books, and to call it a textbook is doing it quite a favor. If that's what you're into - a lot of dreams with no technical info to back it up, this book - and the most recent Starfleet manual - are for you. If you genuinely want to learn about real subjects in the area of high performance computing and networking, tho, skip this thing with prejudice."
3,"For the money, it's worth it","Robert's video review is spot on. My only comment is that here in California many cellular calls show up as ""California"" so the caller ID announces ""call from California."""
1,Cute idea; poor execution,"I thought this would be a good idea for hearing who's calling from across the room. It basically doesn't work for a bunch of reasons:The software does not do a very good job of interpretting names; even when it does the voice is hard to understand; when a number comes in without a name (or as ""wireless caller"" or ""out of area"" for instance), it will say ""out of area"" instead of reverting to announcing the underlying number, which you'd see on a text caller ID; it takes a couple rings before it starts to announce; etc. Overall, it's been completely useless."
2,Needs more power and clarity,"This product is useful, but the voice is not loud enough and the pronounciation in unclear. It is somewhat helpful, but it could be greatly improved. I am not really happy or stisfied with the product."
4,Does the job pretty well.,This device does an adequate job of verbally announcing the names of callers. Its pronunciation is far from perfect but it is understandable once it is gotten used to. The volume is adequate to fill a large room. All in all it is a good buy for the money. I purchased it for my aged mother who is all but blind. She says it has been a great help to her. I would recommend it for anyone but keep in mind that its pronunciation is far from perfect.
5,Basic but wonderful talking caller id,This device helps me a lot. I can not read a text caller id so this helps. I have no trouble understanding the voice. The voice is very plesent. Yes it might be hard to understand the text to speech but when you get use to it you will love it. It sounds just like the panasonic phone with talking caller id. If you are blind or visualy impaired this will help a lot. One thing that needs to get fixked is that when a call comes in from a cell phone or out of aria it will just say cell phone MA. I think the number should follow the name. Over all it works grate.
3,Taling caller id,"I am not pleased with device, and will be exchanging.Can't understand the the voice when a call comes in"
3,Intellitouch SBC-40 Stand Alone Annoucer,Product is small and compact. I have Verizon FIOS but it is not compatible with the FIOS provided caller ID notification system.
4,Not bad,Bought this on Friday's sale and got it after a week. The quality is not bad because by checking the solid wood. It is easy to assembly but heavy.
5,love these pans,"I bought these pans several months ago and love them! They look great, are high quality, and very easy to clean. I definitely got my money's worth."
3,Only one problem!,Warning to those like me who bought this because it was such a beautiful red color. If you wash these in the dishwasher - which I eventually broke down and did - they fade and look terrible. Doesn't affect cooking of course and no complaints there.
1,Not Hard- Anodized !!!,"KitchenAid Gourmet Reserved 12-Piece Hard-Anodized Cookware Set, Redis VERY misleading. The set arrived today and is NOT hard anodized aluminium. The product manual advises not to use this on glass top stoves which is the reason we bought the set to begin with. Amazon customer service accepted a return authorization however they pointed out the actual ""product description"" does not refer to anodized at all.Let's see how the return goes....Couldn't give a ZERO star rating."
2,Not Healthy; But Does Supply Protein,The taste is only okay; the cost is good for a bar with this much protein but it's almost all from soy. It has too much irom content for men; and it's sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
2,These are not love songs - more like elevator music.,Read the reviews and this seemed like a good bet for some nice love songs. Really sounds like elevator music - no jazzy intimate songs just marshmellow. Cannot recommend.
2,Quit After a Short Time,I purchased this system in 2004. Finally got around to installing this on my computer with Windows XP and FS9. The joystick quit after only a few MINUTES USE. The throttle was ok. I uninstalled the SST drivers and reinstalled just the basic system drivers to no avail. The SST Programming software needs to be studied to be used. I am going back to my old Force Feedback Pro until I can afford a yoke and throttle system. Very disappointing.
2,Piece of junk,This thing became uncalibrated and stayed that way in less than a month. For the price and brand I was very disappointed.
1,broken on delivery,"This was a birthday gift for my son and arrived with the handle lock already broken as the screw will not lock it into position. Son is so hyped up about keeping it because of the new game he got I may or may not return it. He thinks he can ""make it lock"" so we will see what the next 30 days holds. Really disappointed after spending so much money on an item to have it come defective."
2,my x52 review,where do i begin x52 is fun too use but if your using windows 7 64 bit good luck i called saitek spent 2hrs on the phone with tech guy even he couldn't figure it out
4,Saitek X52,"This is a very classy and well-designed joystick, made of Plastic with some metal paneling, that is very slick and responsive. A warning, though, for those of you wishing to use it on Macs, the throttle does not work, only the buttons on it and the thumb slide control. Also, the mouse ha switch doesn't work on mac, but everything else does. I highly recommend it.Saitek X52 Flight Control System"
5,Unbeatable cost/benefits rate,"Same functionality as more expensive HOTAS.Grate ergonomic design, plug and play, easy to setup, grate precission. A clear advenacemente over x-45.Onlly problem is that it might feel too light at some times.This HOTAS would benefit a lot from a stiffer stick."
3,x 52,It is very nice but it will not work on my Mac computer . can somebody help me with this as I am getting a little bit frustrated with it what do I need to do to get it to work on a Mac if there's anybody out there that can help me I would appreciate it very much I have the mountain lion installed thank you.
1,Review of Saitek X52 Control System,I had to return it to the factory because the joystick had a tendency to 'stick' as I moved it around. It is definitely inferior to a CH joystick I had a few years ago.
5,Excellent flight control system,I had just bought the X52 and thrust master t fight and I have to give the edge to the X 52 for the following reasons first the buttons and cabling are easier to work with.
4,Works well,This product works great but the mouse and software doesn't work well on window's 7. It works fine for what I do.
4,Good Flight Control System,"I purchased this with the CH Pro pedals. I used the control system with a IMAC 24"" XPlane flight sim and all worked fairly well. The sensitivities of the controls are good and the control assignments were easily. Setup was simple, the construction seems durable and the included rubber cups prevents the controls slipping on my desk. I really like the setup since it uses only one usb port to connect to my computer. When I get bored with XPlane, I switch over to windows/fusion and fly MS Flight Sim X - and whether it's the control systems or Sim X control assignments are limited.Overall a good product."
1,Defunt,"I had nothing but problems after receiving my X52. Blue screen of death, weird windows behaviors. The software shipped with this product is a bad joke."
3,Problem with Joystick connections,"I am having a problem with connecting the joystick to the computer as it has a PS/2 lead [nothing to do with Playstation it is HP / IBM cable], so I am not sure how to procede from here. I have managed to find a PS/2 to USB connector, but this requires two inputs [originally for mouse and keyboard], and so, whilst all the lights come on on the joystick it does not function at all. I would have wanted to know that the flight controller has a USB connection and that the joystick has a PS/2 lead, and how to get something to convert the PS/2 lead into a USB connection. Another solution could be to have a plug which can convert a PS/2 lead into a joystick socket which would then allow me to connect the joystick to the sound-card. This is on an old, old computer and I don't know whether new desktop PS's have this availability on newer soundcards. Any advice on how to proceed?"
3,Not sure but hopeful,"This is the only joystick I've owned. Got it about 9 months ago. After a couple months the light to the ""B"" button stopped working. Today I mailed it back for replacement due to a right drift problem that I could not get to correct by recalibration. I will stay with the X52 and hope for the best. I do feel it is a good set up and I really liked using it until the drift problem arose."
1,Not Worth All The Trouble,"I got X52 for Christmas and have been using it for X3, IL2 and Wings of Prey. The controllers are well built and look great. I wish they worked half as well. I have profiles for all the games. The game starts fine and then I lose the X and Y Axis or rudder control. The deadzone settings are not very good. If I reboot control comes back for a few minutes and then the same problem happens again. I have sent a ticket into Saitek so we will see what happens. I you want to use this controller for MSFS it is well supported but I would not use it for anything else."
2,saitek x52,The joystick sticks like it needs oil and also has tooooo much freeplay & is verry hard to control the airplanes . I have sent 3 messages referencing these problems with no answer to what can be done with this Saitek X 52.
5,great system,this product is really good... the best thing about them for me is how easy to move the are and also how responesive the controls are to the game. i highly recomend this to anyone looking for a joystick and a throtel. They are also easy to downloadhighly recomend
2,Controls are great but...,"I am having technical difficulties with the joystick. The device was designed for Windows XP and the driver CD that ships with it has not been updated for more recent versions of the driver and profile editing software. After downloading the updated drivers and software from Saitek's confusing web site, the device is still having problems. Saitek's support has been slow to respond. I have even sent back the original device received because I thought it was possibly defective. The second device is having the same issue.I cannot recommend this device with a clear conscious. There have to be other ways to waste your time and money."
4,Great product - bad software,"The product itself works great and is very responsive. I use this stick for battlefield 3 but the problem is that for some reason the software causes problems with the game because it is constantly reading input even if the stick is not moving. This makes it hard for a game like BF3 where you will be in multiple scenarios where the keyboard and mouse is better suited for some (on foot or ground vehicles) and stick for others (jets and helicopters). When I am on foot, my character turns and runs, along with other things, on his own because the game is receiving input from the stick at the same time as keyboard and mouse. This stick would probably be great for Flight Sims, and I think I just need to work with the controls and programming some more to get it working good for battlefield 3."
5,fine with windows 7 home 32 bit,"Quick delivery, the product seems to be well made.I saw some reviews that indicated that the stick and throttle wouldn't work with windows 7 - After I had purchased it!I was pretty nervous when I got the unit but after searching Saitek's website I found some drivers for the x52 pro and these enable the thing to work fine.For some reason the multi function screen doesn't seem to come on but as I was after a flight control system, it didn't really matter a whole lot. Maybe I'll figure it out some day.As a joystick I was after something better that the standard fare. I use it to practice flying to cut down on the time it takes me to learn something in the air and I found standard joysticks really not good enough for what I was doing. I don't know quite what it is about it but it does make the simulation much more realistic and gives a sense of much more linear control. I am happy with this purchase."
1,CHEAP AND BREAK EASY,"They broke in just one week. Real disappointment. The things are made so cheap. Buy a Thrustmaster setup this thing is just going to make you go through a hastle of returns, IF YOU ARE LUCKY. Mine have ended up coffee table ornaments. Dont buy expensive gadgets from Amazon. Go to a store and or order from a specialty. I had to spend a fortune for these and then waited three weeks for replacements. I also had to pay for shipping as well. Amazon sucks. Avoid the hastles and extra hidden expenses: shop elsewhere"
2,Get it together,When ibreceived the box it was smashed and was poorly packed.Stick works fine and is great.Wouldn't Reccomend amazon warehouse to buy from though.
4,"Awesome Flight Stick, cannot program on x64 machine!","Hardware wise, this is one of the 'Cadillacs' of flight sticks. The movement is very smooth and not jumpy or glitchy. It is a bit on the sensitive side, but it can easily be gotten used to in a day's time.Be warned that because the drivers for the software that programs the stick are not ""digitally signed,"" they will not work on a 64-bit Windows machine! The stick will work fine without being programmed, but about 5 of the function buttons will not work (buttons needed for a flight simulator work fine; the affected buttons are meant to duplicate mouse functionality and a 'FUNCTION' switch with 3 settings).If Saitek would just fix the programming issue, I would have given this the full rating. But they seem preoccupied with the next stick they are working on. Also, their driver download website was incomplete and buggy, last I checked."
5,Flight Control sysytem,This product felt very good and comfortable vs. other ones I got. I am glad I bought it. thanks
2,Broke after two weeks,Cannot really recommend this product. My x52 broke after only three weeks. The unit wouldn't power on anymore when connecting it through USB. Had to return it to Amazon. The joystick also lacks precision. The spring mechanism doesn't allow for smooth motion. The motion is very jumpy as friction in the plastic base is non-linear; especially when moving the stick very slowly.
2,Rudder axis problem,We have had two of these in our house and within about a year to year and a half the rudder axis has gone out on both of them. When you go to properties you can see that the rudder axis flickers.
5,Best flight controller ever!,If you're serious about flight sims there's only one controller you have got to have and that's the x52. Great throttle controls and a very responsive stick. Highly programmable and worth every penny.
1,Disappointed in control sensitivity,"Got a Flight Simulator X program for Xmas. Really looked forward to flying (no previous experience with any program or equipment). So I thought I'd get a good control system, shelled out $110 for the Saitek X52 system. Finding it extremely frustrating and difficult to complete even the simple beginner's tutorial programs because the joystick does not respond to very light pressure to bank and make small direction corrections. Doesn't respond at all until joystick is leaned over 30 dgrees, and then reacts to over-correct direction. Have tried adjusting the sensitivity slide adjustment on the throttle with little apparent help. Joystick works OK for elevator (climb-descend}. Wish I had started out with one of the cheaper $30-$40 joysticks."
5,Excelent versitile joystick,"Though it works in Windows 7 with no software, it works much better with drivers installed.NOTE, it is easy to download the WRONG drivers. There is a PRO version who's drivers DO NOT work with the basic version."
5,Saitek X52 is a Great Product!,It's sweet! I like everything about it. Not complicated to learn and took no time at all to master the controls. It is great for fighter simulations. I have had other controllers to which they don't compare. Well worth the money!
2,Software buggy,"The joystick as a piece of hardware is great. However, what they don't tell you that the software is buggy. Operating it as a simple stick works fine, but when it comes to loading profiles to take full advantage of the joystick and the LCD the thing crashes. I've contacted support and their suggestions did not solve the problem. I also see other users in fora having the same problem. I don't think it's worth the time needed to make it work."
2,"good hardware, bad software","At the moment, I can only give this product 2 stars for a typical experience. The current profile editor is absolutely terrible. Is it a coincidence saitek was recently bought out by madcatz and now the profile editor has gone to trash? I can only speculate.To make this a 4.5 star product, search and download the old SD5 series profile editor and you'll have a much better experience. I know the sd5 works with windows XP. I believe it may not work with Vista.The hardware is excellent, but because of the current state of the software, I'd say stay away unless you have XP and are willing to track down old drivers. Madcatz really needs to fix the new profile editor."
5,Best choice for the money...,"In my opinion this is the best flight control system under $100 and is well worth the money, unless of course you have unlimited funds and would like the very cream of the crop (in which case I would suggest the thrustmaster cougar system). Build quality is a bit lights, but for money this system will provide you with a much improved flight simulator experience. I use the X52 for my combat flight simulators and save my CH Products Flightsim Yoke for flight simulator X/2004 Although setup is trouble free, you will need a lot of time to customize the buttons per your flight sim. All in all, if you are thinking of upgrading to a good HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) system there is no reason you shouldn't look in the X52"
5,Saitek X52,I have had Flight Simulator software for years now and have used Microsoft joysticks since the first one. This Saitek joystick opened a whole new way of Flying . I would recommend this product to all . It does take some time to learn how to program for each of the different planes that you will fly . In the end it is worth it . It is best to save and back-up your hard drive other wise all that work is lost .
3,It's great unless you fly IFR,"The problem that I had with them was that when I installed the drivers, everything would work fine except the Multi Function Display that displays the date and time, this is a must if you fly IFR. Needless to say that the time and date would not change. I figured that it was probably the joystick so I got another one, it did the same thing. After several attempts with Tech Support they finally decided that I should send them back to them, this was on December 14th when I shipped them Fedex. As of January 9, 2007 I am still waiting for something to come back to me. They are extremely slow to respond. I am sure that they will find nothing with the joystick and I will be stuck with something that has issues. Buyer Beware!!!"
4,Lots of extras,This joystick was purchased for my son he uses it for flight sim 10 he says its the best joystick he has ever used lots of buttons and switches to set up anyway you like for me a little to much for the people who use joysticks alot it perfect he is 100% happy with it
1,Saitek X52 the real deal,This joystick broke a few days after i bought it and saitek only makes things look good not play good theres my 2 cents
1,Saitek X52 Flight Control System,"Saitek X52 Flight Control System, i ordered this system and i am sure it was sent to me, i have a very new address and the mailman said he did not know the shippinng address was being used and sent it back to sender, i have not heard any news about maybe gettting it reshipped to me, Thank you for your help.shipping address;4400 Avenue N#48Galveston, Texas281-788-4926thanks Lisa Raney"
3,Great controller,"Really like this device. A lot of buttons with user configurable settings. Issue for me is the software is horrible. It might be an issue for only my PC which wouldn't surprise me, but still. I did download the updated versions of the software only to find some compatibility issues again with my PC. This may not be consistent. It's a great buy, and the worst that can happen is that it you have software issues and have the option to return it. Mine was a gift."
3,Overall a good stick.!!!,"It works great except for the spring underneath the handle. TOO WEAK!!!!!!!!Saitek can have a real good product if get this glitch fixed.I temporarily tied 2 surgical gloves around the spring cup, and base.Still better than nothing.!!!!The throttle works great!!!!The button functions are superb also!!!!."
2,Drivers Kill it,The drivers absolutely don't work on win 7 64 bit. I have followed the developers procedure to properly fix it and i have never been able to get it to run the way it should. The hardware is great. The software is the only problem.
5,Excellent Idea Book!,"I have been a professional faux painter for over 5 years. This is the book I turn to when a client is looking for something unusual. The photos provide endless, timeless finishes and designs. I have spent countless hours poured over Mr. Carter's book and I always find a little something in the pictures that I can turn into a 'new' look. The current 'in-style' colors may change, but that is the beauty of paint! Change the colors and you have a new look. As I always say, the best ideas usually begin as someone else's!"
5,Love it,"Could not find this game anywhere else. My son wanted it for Christmas, so I am thrilled to be able to find it here."
4,FANTASTIC!,"I totally got hooked on the Phoenix Wright games when i played the second one, now i've got all three to play. They are so much fun. It was a fast delivery and everything was like it said in the description. Great game series, i'd recommend it to anyone out there who like mysteries and puzzle games."
5,Trails of your life,"This game is so fun, after every episode, every piece of evidence, and after every battle in court you'll be begging for more!"
2,set of 2?,"if a set of 1 means 1 glove and not 1 pair, who the hell would buy a set. a set of 2 means 2 pair not 2 gloves. this guy is an idiot. plus the gloves wore through in about 2 weeks. ive bought gloves for 7$ that lasted longer."
4,photo deceiving,"Photo shows roll of loc line but read the description carefully. It comes in 6"" segments. Helpful to have the tool to assemble."
5,Wind Power explained,"I found this book to be very informative. Not all of my questions were answered, but I now feel that I have a basic grasp of how to design and build my own scrapyard wind turbine. If you are interested in this I highly recommend this book for your collection of reference materials."
2,Good For Those With Two Left Feet,"The songs on Dolphina's albums are too plain and boring to use for a show, but it might be good for those who are just developing some rhythm in their dancing at home. The music does not have a very authentic feel at all. Intermediate and advanced students/performers may find that this music feels quite silly dancing to it."
2,fragile and straw malfunctions,"Had this bottle for a week. It fell on the ground and cracked, rendering the double wall useless. While i had it, the straw would constantly get stuck in the cap, which was a pain to deal with."
1,Can't take a strong hand.,I've gone thru 20 of these so far (Autistic child)The top of the bottle cracks and breaks off whenever the lid if tighten too much.
1,Don't buy this!!,"Very disappointing product. Made with inferior thin outer plastic material. 2 of the 3 bottles I bought cracked first day used, when it tipped over because of the heavier top caused by metal carbinger. I do NOT recommend buying this bottle. A bottle should last more than one day without cracking. This bottle is garbage. Only reason 3rd hasn't cracked because I didn't take it out of the package. I'll be sending it back. I want my money back."
3,"nice bottle, cracks easily","I have five of these bottles. I use them for my morning OJ on the way to work. They work well and don't leak much when they tip over. The only downside is that they are fairly fragile and they are not machine washable. Since the bottles can't (well, it can, but it really decreases their lifespan) go in the dishwasher, they have to be hand washed. While sitting on the counter to dry they've been knocked onto the floor causing them to crack and shatter. True, that's probably considered abuse, but you just don't expect a plastic bottle to suffer that amount of damage from a three foot fall. If not for the less than stellar durability I'd rate it five stars."
1,dissatisfied,I supecifically ordered a purple trudeau cool down 24 oz hydration bottle. The color purple is listed in the written version of the order but a blue bottle is showing. This is a gift but to late to send back. your customer service is bad. Please reply
4,"nice bottle, breaks easy","I had bought 2 of these bottles at Target less than a year ago, and they were perfect for my boyfriend and I... until they were dropped for the first time. They cracked around the top even though they weren't necessarily dropped on their tops. I also think that screwing the lid on tightly might have caused it to start cracking, although I couldn't prove it. The cracks caused the bottles to start leaking and we had to trash both of them. If you're gentler than we are, these are awesome bottles, but if you're a little bit on the rough side, skip this one."
2,High Hopes,"I was looking forward to using this hydration bottle during my workouts. I received the bottle damaged at the base poor packing on this shipment. As the other reviews I found the base outer shell very thin and the poor packing contributing to the damage. Sorry Amazon you lost on this one, I found a durable double insulated BPA free at Walmart for $5.99 28oz."
2,Disappointed,"I bought one of these before from Target, but they stopped carrying them. I love the design, however the black one is defective and doesn't screw easily at all. It will eventually screw on, but it takes way too much time. The other one was a stocking stuffer so I haven't tried to drink from it (obviously) so hopefully that one is not also defective. I paid so much money for these plus the shipping. Never again."
1,"Love the Bottle, Highly Disappointed with the Durability","I was very disappointed with the durability of this water bottle. I use mine every day and broke it in less than one week. It fell as I was getting out of my car. Although it was my fault, I would have expected that it could sustain more than one fall. The inside detached from the outer bottle. Considering I just spent around $17 to purchase it, it was not a good investment."
3,Poor Quality : (,"I had a bottle just like this one that I loved and lasted for years until I lost it. I ordered this as a replacement and it looks identicle but the quality is not. I had the bottle for only 3 months and I hadn't used it excessively when it broke. It broke when it fell off my bike in cycle class. It barely hit the carpeted ground and it was done. Such a shame because the bottle has great features that I haven't been able to find in other models, like a wide mouth to use under the ice maker and a soft flexible straw, also it's very large to last me through a long hard workout. Very sad the bottle did not hold up."
1,Leaky bottle,"I wanted a bottle that I could carry easily with a straw that disappeared. This bottle did all that but the top was extremely difficult to twist and even if the bottle was only 1/2 full, the liquid would spill into the mouth piece and straw area and leak all over my things and my clothes while carrying.Very disappointed. I had to throw it out after two days of wet clothes and things.I also purchased it's sister, looks slightly different on the cup itself but the top is easy to turn and it keeps the liquid in the cup."
2,Great Bottle; Horrible Lid,"I am a big user of Trudeau's Bottles even though they break easy. I am willing to give up some durabilty because when using this bottle, I ensure I get enough liquids in every day. The problem with this bottle is it is a crap shoot if the lid will turn easy or be so tight you cannot use it. This shipment included two bottles with lids so tight I couldn't turn them to tuck in the straw."
1,"Steve Nash (Action Montage) Sport Poster Print 11""x17""",The poster looked like it was printed on a home printer on cheap paper. Very poor quality.
1,Don't buy,Don't buy from this company. My order has not been shipped and my money it's not turn back in my account.
3,Ok works and is Vanilla,Not much more to say. Since now I order Burts Bees and other organic/natural prodcuts I can't rate it any better than okay
4,Fast & Furious,"Burn out, burn out, I'm on my way out, you can't kill me, I'M DEAD!(Wurm) That says it all."
5,Nice small pond net,I used this to keep leaves out of my small pond and it worked out great. Nice net for the price.
3,Sinker,"The netting seems to be very strong BUT, if it's cut to the size of the pond it will sink!!! So next year I plan on fabricating a PVC cage that will hold the netting above the pond to prevent leaves from entering. Otherwise it seems like a decent net."
3,Heart Warming but Short,"I bought this book because I worked at the children's home where these women lived for a period of their lives. Since they are not professional writers, the literary aspect of it is very basic, but the stories are interesting and heart-warming. It was interesting to read about their lives and it was a quick read."
2,labels remove blue surface,"The bottles look beautiful, however when you try to remove the label from the bottom it peels off some of the blue coating. I wrote to the company and told them I would still keep the bottles but thought they should know about the problem with the labels. They did not reply to my note."
3,Buyer be aware....,"I just picked up the blue version of this spice jar.All is as described except there is no liner in the cap, so if you remove the sprinkle insert then it's bare metal on glass. This won't be an air tight seal which is what you want for your spices. I've been looking online but without much luck for cap liners. I've found new caps with liners that will fit these jars but they are of the baby food variety or have a metal rim like the Spice Islands jars which aren't quite as sharp-looking as these RSVP ones. May have to get the latter tho, to keep the spices fresh.At this time, the color is still painted on. Since they just arrived, I can't comment on the longevity of the paint. I did take the stickiest label I have and put it on and pulled it off without any of the blue coming off, but this is no comparison for trying to pull off a label that's been on there for awhile or what will happen from being rattled around in the spice drawer with other jars...Cheers,"
5,Excellent technique book even for a beginner in Corel Draw,Prior to reading Shane's book I had pretty much given up on being able to learn the program...I was stunned to see how easy he made it to create stunning images in coreldraw...I learned techniques I truely did not feel capable of learning prior to reading his book and enjoyed the process...His enclosed cd alone was worth the price of the book ...He does not guard his techniques ...he shares them openly and wants you do know all he knows...very well organized and writen and simply turned my graphics life around!
5,granniejk,Love this product. Very quality product and I love how my skin feels after using it for a couple weeks. It was delivered as promised and in very good condition. I will order this again.
2,"very good product, but bad packaging and old product","the night solution from mary kay is an AMAZING product. Note that it wont change your skin dramatically, but you will be able to tell the difference when you stop using it. this was my first time purchasing the serum from this seller but i got hooked by the discounted price and the free shipping offered by amazon. the package arrived a little late than usual but it was because of the weekends and that was understandable. however, the box the serum was in was opened and cringed up as if someone just shoved the product back in. another downside was the fact that this item was made last year:( i was debating to return it, but the pump of the serum was locked and its okay to use cosmetics like this within a year of opening so i just decided to use it. the serum itself is indeed a decent product. however, i think ill just order it from mary kay official site for a legit product"
5,It was good,"The product does prevent dry skin, It didn't make me totally youthful, but it did it's bestBetty"
2,"Cute Concept, Poorly Executed","What a neat idea! The concept that animals ""speak"" differently in different languages might be a little hard for a toddler to grasp, but is fun and interesting nonetheless. However, the illustrations and page layout are such that the text is lost. There's nowhere for the reader's eye to rest, and certainly none of the bold, immidiately visible and easily identifiable images that small children delight in."
1,Avoid at all costs! The holes are too big for some teas.,"This tea ball is horrible for some of the kinds of teas you may use. If you use teas which only consist of large, whole leaves, I guess you'll be ok with this tea ball, but I use some teas which have little pieces of berries or other fruit.Inevitably, the little pieces end up making it through the holes (they are too big) and you end up having to pick these pieces out of your mouth. NOT an enjoyable way to relax with tea. Get a mesh ball, which has much smaller holes and will not present the same problem."
2,tea leaves need to float around,I never use this ball. It replaces a tea bag but requires cleaning after each use.
1,You've Gotta Be Kidding Me!,"I honestly don't know where to begin. The storyline isn't believable, the events don't really flow well, and the acting ... Oh boy. The acting was resoundingly abysmal. All in all, the movie looked and sounded cheap. I'm shocked that Youssef Chahine let such amateurish work get out in the wild effectively marring his accomplished career. I was seriously embarrassed for him as I painfully endured this movie.The concepts in this film were interesting, though--identity crisis, terrorism, love, classism, and corruption. Unfortunately, the execution was lacking and the characters weren't believable or sympathetic. I didn't care whether they died or lived.Save yourself time and money and pick something else. Preferably one of Youssef Chahine's older classics like the Alexandria Trilogy or Destiny."
1,The worst,"The worst Yusuf Shahin movie ever, and one of the worst movies in the Arabian Cinema. Only stupid people can watch it."
3,PLEASURABLE READ,"Not O'Brian or Kent, but still a good author. This book is less interested in the fooling around, and more into describing the sailing and naval battles."
3,Popview,"This CD is cool if you are a true fan like myself. They talk about many different topics on the scan of two tracks. It's not that much money either, so if you are a fan I suggest ordering it."
4,Glenn Miller - The Quintessential Band Leader!,"This is a high quality recording with Glenn Miller's Band performing many of his biggest hits. For any true Glenn Miller fan, this CD will not disappoint! Long live big band music. Pick this one up, and enjoy!"
3,Toilet kit,"the bag is smaller than I anticipated and rather flimsy. It will work, but I am a bit disappointed in it and would not choose antohter like it."
4,Finally a decent and intelligent introduction to qi gong,"Books on qi gong tend to have two flaws: being overly practical (move this way) or burying the beginner in theory. This book picks a nice middle ground, where theroy and practical concerns are mixed. The authors attempt to put qi qong in relations to modern science (not badly done) and religions (totally misunderstands Christianity). Practice advice is given for the beginner and a fair bit of theory (in readable terms). It's a good book and one I'd recommend to a beginner. A less silted writing styles and more illustrations would be nice but its definitely worth the money."
2,"Misleading picture--no finger picks included, just thumb picks","I bought this package because, based on the photo, I thought I would be getting plastic thumb picks and finger picks. When it arrived it was only thumb picks. Also the thumb picks catch my banjo strings if I am playing aggressively. Would have given 3-4 stars if the picture wasn't misleading."
2,disapointed,"for what i payed, these aren't worth is. the picture actually shows a pick that can go on your index as well so by that i just assumed that they were finger picks and not just thumb picks (although i did type finger picks on the search bar) well anyways, i got thumb picks for 5 dollars, and yeah thats that. :/ LAME"
2,Too small,I have medium sized fingers and could not get these on my fingers without some discomfort. Consequently I have not used them.
3,Does the job,as long as you make sure your a medium. I personally find it much easier to play stringed instruments with my fingers instead of picks
1,Is this for reals?????,"This must be a joke! Kari Wuhrer, a fine woman just like jennifer lopez. I thought she can pull off good singing like Jennifer lopez but well..........sorry."
1,This CD is much like this womans acting unfocused and weak,"I got this CD from a friend in the nisic world. I tried my best to sit through it, but just begune to feel weak in the belly. Why can't these actors just stick to what they have been best at. Being seen not heard....."
1,"This is a joke, right?","Not knowing that Kari had done anything since Remote Control, I borrowed her album from a friend and had a listen. It was awful. She's clearly tone deaf, and her lyrics are sophomoric. I see several good reviews here, so either some people actually think she's a good singer, or they think she's so hot that they'd listen to her belch the alphabet. The only thing I can think is that she made this album as a joke, or she lost a bet."
2,Not nearly as awful as you'd expect!,"Kari is an exceptionally beautiful woman, and I've always appreciated that.Kari's 10-year show biz resume is nothing more than showing off her pretty face and great body, and I purchased this CD because I expected it to be laugh-out-loud awful. The joke's on me -- it's better than that.Kari doesn't have the strongest voice, but it is kind of pretty and she has nothing to be ashamed of here. The songs are lightweight, but that is probably the exact marketing niche her producers were looking for.I will listen to this from time to time, and probably buy her next CD."
4,Good stuff you haven't heard,"This singer is better known for her acting, but she has a good sense of music. While genuinely rock infused, this album also has a touch of trip hop and new wave. And though she doesn't have outstanding singing skills, her sensual voice has a lot of feel and flow to it. It's really too bad that she didn't get more attention, because this is good stuff. If you are a fan of Tori Amos or Sophie B. Hawkins, you would probably enjoy Kari Wuhrer."
1,Tone Deaf?,I think she should stick to taking off her clothes. I would have given 0 stars but it was not an option.
3,What a surprise!,"Wow...I listened to some of the clips of this and decided to order it online. I am shocked and pleasantly surprised! Sure, Kari is one of the most beautiful women in the world and clearly the sexiest on television, but songs like ""I Can't Cope"" stand up with anything that's on radio today. Actual creatvity! Good singing! This album isn't a joke or a way for someone to cash in on her fame. Instead, it's downright amazing. Mr. Wurher, you've gone from pin-up to an actual ARTIST! I never dreamed you had in it you...now will you marry me?"
3,Probably exactly what you expect.,"Yep, I'm another guy who bought this because of my 20 year crush on Kari. No, I didn't expect too much to be honest.After a few spins however I found it to be pretty decent. I admit she is not the best singer, but most of the songs have a good hook and are quite catchy. This is no doubt a pop album, but a few of the songs seem to lean alternative. Maybe just my ears but I hear a bit of Tonya Donelly (Belly) in her voice. Shiny is a good balance of danceable tracks, ballads and light rockers.The photos in the booklet aren't what many of us were hoping for, but there's a few nice shots. Hopefully she gets some more screen time soon."
4,Practical applications are gems.,"I have had a hard time thinking of this book by it's main title: Beyond the Walls. I have been calling it (in my mind) Monastic Wisdom for Everyday Life which is, of course, its subtitle.I had hoped for more personal stories of life at the monastery, and then life outside the monastery with the author putting his monastic lessons into practice. While there was a good bit of that, there was also a lot of philosophizing which I often found tedious. I felt as if I had to slog through the theory to get to the next practical application.Nonetheless, the lessons learned were valuable, and I'm glad I own this book."
1,Nothing but an Overview of Where Grids Are in 2003 and Where Could They Go,"I am intensely interested in the current state of Grid technology (Dec. 2005) and want to begin an implementation or the participation of a modern Grid. I got the book yesterday and am now done with it. This book should never have had a second edition. I skimmed through all 748 pages in about one hour. It is repeat of topic after topic by different authors rehashing the same 'issues' that anyone who found this book has probably already learned as much in his Googling.This is frustrating, WHERE IS THE MEAT!!!! in Grid technology. No one seems to have a decent book. Its almost 2006! Someone, teach me how to build a Grid and run Hello World on it please!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Nasty alien monsters, Storm and the Morlocks, Cyclops solo, Wolverine in Japan. The legend continues. Some of the best X-Men stories are set in space, and you could I suppose view the whole thing as a form of space opera. That being said, when Wolverine and/or one or two of the others venture into Japan those are usually very good, as well. No different here."
5,"A Daily Helping of Bucky, Rob, Satchel and Pals","Whether it's the war between Bucky and Fungo, Rob's ongoing battle for dominance of the household, or Satchel's innocent view of the world, there's something everyone can enjoy and relate to in this little gem of a comic strip. It is one of the most witty, refreshing, and downright funny stips to come along in a long time.Best of all, this daily calendar provides me with a laugh almost every day. If there's any downside to it, it's that I don't throw away the previous strips. There are just too many good Get Fuzzy strips to justify getting rid of them.If you're limited on space at home, or spend your day at the office in a veal cube like I do, this would be the perfect addition to bring a little laughter to an otherwise mundane day.I'm just about through my 2005 calendar and have an order in for the 2006 version. I need my daily quota of ""Get Fuzzy""!"
5,Get Fuzzy: 2006 Scratch-a-Day Calendar,I received the calendar within a couple of days of my placing the order. The service is great and I love to read my daily cartoon.
3,I quattro rusteghi at a distance...,"This opera was written by a man who, better even than Puccini, knew how to write recitative! In fact, the entire opera is made up of recit. Remember, this was written after melodies had gone out of fashion, never to be heard again except in Broadway shows.. It's interesting and listenable, but for a bel canto lover such as I am, once a decade is plenty. I was basically hoping to hear a good recording of the gr8 and unique voice of Magda Olivero, which would make the whole thing shine for me... Unfortunately, the sound is recorded from a distance, and her voice is unrecognizable in comparison to her original 78's done in the studio and the couple of video things I've heard. I've only given it 3 stars, because it just didn't ""light my fire""... It IS a good recording of the opera, however, if you're looking for a version to study."
2,A cheap gun,"Ill list the pros and cons of this gunPros:Large magazine capacityPump style cockingCheaoCons:InaccurateDelcicate magazine, Mine broke in less then 200 shotsUncomfortable trigger handleLow fps for spring powered gun"
2,terrible,"This is da worst gun-low fps-horrible accuracy-broke after about 30 min.-clip is fragileIf you get this gun, don't say i did not warn you. here are some good things about it.-mutiple firethat is y you shall not get this gun."
5,YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER A GUN EVEN IF IT'S OVER 200 DOLLARS,THIS IS THE TOP OF THE LINE AIRSOFT GUN YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER ONAND I'M NOT KIDDNG
4,Bright safety device and night vision saver,"This LED light is a great safety tool for your car when broken down. We also keep one attached to our fridge in the garage in case the power goes out. The red light preserves night vision as well. The backing prevents scratching paint well, but it would like see it be a bit thicker if used often as I can see it wearing off. Solid product!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this thinking it would be extra cushion and also extend the view back from the camera. Well, it does move you a little back from the camera, but also reduces the magnification.You clip it to the camera body, and then attach the eyepiece cushion to it.After wasting my money, it now just sits in my bag."
1,Not A Good Product At All,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who was envious of my similar pasta pot. I didn't know what kind I had (should have looked) but I saw this one on Amazon and it looked identical to mine so I bought it. It turns out that you cannot cook pasta in the strainer ... it boils over and makes a mess. You can only cook pasta in the pot and use the strainer as a collander to drain the pasta after it's cooked ... you definitely cannot leave the strainer in the pot and then simply lift it out when the pasta is ready. If you don't mind this inconvenience, then the product is all right. But if you want it to function as a pasta pot is supposed to, then you will be sorely disappointed."
1,Will they fit my chairs????? Who knows????,Dimensions would really be nice! Wouldn't even consider buying them without knowing if they fit or not!
3,Super Reader,"In a future California that has been busted up, Santa Monica someone sort of survives cataclysms, water, and all that stuff.Aubry Knight is a cyberpunk style bodyguard type, and has a falling out with his boss. Knight ends up crusading against the crime lord types to stop them and their drug plot.Much bashings."
2,assembly required.,"I would just like to let everyone know that this rack comes in a box, in all its pieces. The assembly instructions are very simple to understand; however, it does not actually assemble very easily. It's a system of wooden blocks, drilled on the corners, and some wooden rods to connect each block to the others. Glue is also provided. It gets difficult to insert the rods, and to line them up properly. Anyone who is even half-way competent at wood-working might want to try making one of these on their own."
1,Don't buy this unless you're real handy with hammers/glue.,Wasn't happy when i got it and i had to put it together. A real pain. I thought it was as the picture showed. Not real happy.
3,"OK for the price, but not great.","I bought this stand along with a 9ft market umbrella. Although packaging is flimsy as indicated in the previous reviews, the stand was entirely undamaged. It seems reasonably well built, but mine leans about 15 degrees to one side. Definitely a quality control problem. I'm trying to decide if this bothers me enough to return it. I live in Colorado Springs, and we get lots of wind....this base stands no chance with a 9ft umbrella. A 6ft umbrella might be a better fit. I probably would not buy this product again."
3,OK for the money but...,"...they really need to work on packaging! It came in a flimsy cardboard box and the stand was almost sagging out of the bottom. And, like others I read about in previous reviews of this product, the screw heads (plastic) were broken on my stand. The stand itself is sturdy and attractively designed."
4,Umbrella Base,"While I am pleased with both the umbrella and the base, it appeared that the base looked green on-line. Upon further review of the description of the product, it was described as black. I would have preferred that the base was green to coordinate with the umbrella."
4,Sturdy but poorly packed.,"Mine arrived missing two of the screws that hold the little rubber feet to the underside of the base. The product box was far to flimsy for shipping, and was ripped open along half the seems and not much stiffer than tissue paper by the time I received it from FedEx Ground. Amazon would have been happy to pay the return shipping, but when I told them that all I needed was the two screws, they gave me the manufacturer's phone number, whom I called and who quickly mailed the missing parts to me.Otherwise, the stand is solid, sturdy, very heavy, and has no problem holding my 9 foot market umbrella all by itself, without the need for a table. Unlike another reviewer who reported a plastic screw, my stand uses a steel bolt to attach the support tube to the base. And, my umbrella stood straight upright as soon as the two set-screws in the support tube were tightened against the umbrella pole."
1,Bad Packaging and Rust!,"Like others have said, mine arrived looking as if it had been run over by a steam roller. How Amazon can allow shipment in such flimsy packaging is beyond me. Plastic screwheads were damaged. Instead of giving me the phone number of the manufacturer to replace the screws, Amazon sent me another replacement that was in WORSE condition than the first. I put both of them outside on the patio and they are now rusted ( I live near the beach )I've tried using them but they just don't hold even a 7 foot umbrella up in the slightest wind. Don't waste your time or money on this one...."
2,Oxford Garden Designs Market Umbrella Stand,"Although I received the umbrella stand quickly, when I opened it, there were no instructions for putting it together and several parts were scattered and broken. The stand is very heavy (which is a good thing) but I also have a problem with a grease packing within it that came undone during shipping and I have no idea how to fix it. I have looked and looked for ways to contact Amazon about this problem but have had no luck. So, I would advise not ordering this item through Amazon because of the problems with breakage and lack of instructions."
2,Too light for duty,"The stand arrives in a lightweight card board box. As a result the first stand I received was damaged.It hsa two screws in the base to hold the umbrella pole. The screwheads are plastic. These broke in shipping.Within a week, I received a replacement -- not a screw, a whole new stand! They can't get replacement screws. That tells me that this stand won't last long. The plastic heads are bound the break.The stand weighs 40 lbs which is really too light. I bought it with a 9ft umbrella. Any wind moves the umbrella pretty easily and the stand has tipped a few times. I augmented the stand with a 45lb, wide bore Olympic weight. The aesthetics are not great but it is more stable.Next year i will get a commercial quality stand."
5,"My second one in 2 years : great stand, great.","I just received my 2nd stand in 2 years and love them both. They are easy to assemble,lovely, heavy, sturdy and can support the heaviest umbrella. Just make sure the diameter of your umbrella pole will fit in the stand. I highly recommend this stand."
1,Outrageous price,"I assumed when I ordered these that there would be four bowls to the set. Imagine my surprise when the charge was $25 for just one bowl! These are nice bowls but they're not that nice. I still think it was a pricing error, but could not convince the amazon.com representative so I returned them. Too bad, as I really like the bowls."
5,Great for Microwave Heating!,"I could only find 1-Quart Pyrex bowls combined with two other larger bowls at the local Meglo-Mart which I already had and rarely use. I needed a few more of these 1 quart bowls which I tend to use everyday for heating up lunch and dinner foods (and they work great as a ""Jethro BoDean"" cereal bowls as well! (Beverly Hillbillies). The rim on the bowl works well to both hold plastic wrap down tight and provide a ""cool-enough"" place to grab strait out of the microwave. I suspect the lip would be handy for mixing bowl purposes as well.Highly Recommended!"
1,Good Looking But Terrable quality,"I got this airsoft gun because it looked cool and its my favorite shotgun. The first day i got it i obviously was playing around with it allot, it was like the greatest day in my life, untill i cocked it and a pice of the inside broke. I had it only one day and it allredy broke. SO i sent it back to the manufacturer because i thought that one was just defective, then i got a new one and it was working perfectly fine, i brought it everywhere in the house i went, its increadibly fun when u have it but about 5 days after i got the new one i cocked it and then i couldnt pull the trigger and i shaked the gun and i heard broken pieces moving around inside, so i just said nevermind, its not worth sending it back to get another one thats just going to break again. I strongly suggest no one buys this item, it looks cool, it shoots decently, but it is the worst quality airsoft gun i have ever used."
2,Err... It's kind of sub-par,"I don't know, but when I first got mine, I took it out of the box and the stalk broke. And I am by no means a tough guy, but it broke anyway. It is rather low quality I must admit.The next two days were spent shooting my sister with some high-powered airsoft pellets. But after that, some springs in the gun's innerworkings came undone, and I had to take it apart to put it back together, yet it has never been the same since... OK, I modified it with some higher-powered springs and it shoots great...If I had a choice to go back in time and buy this again... I wouldn't. That's what I have to say. Take my advice or not..."
2,Broken,"It broke the day i bought it, i would reccomenfd it if it was about 7 bucks. Other then that, its a crapshot."
1,bad,"its like a dog took a crap and it looks like an spas12.it randomly shot when it came out of the box. if you want 2 use it as a prop, it is 5 stars. very good looking"
5,awesome gun,"i am 16 years old and i do know what i am talking about. this gun has high power, accurate, great looking gun. the stock will not break off if you don't drop it. overall great gun."
1,Shot gun,I got this gun from my freind for $20. When it worked it was ok I couldn't see the bbs in midair like the other kid said. The stock brakes easy and the inside parts of the gun break the first day of use. Its a peice of junk
1,Truly rotten sound,"Offenbach's operetta is lots of fun and, when it can be made out, Huguette Tourangeau gives a stunning performance as the Duchess. But the sound is terrible, as if the recording had been made by a mini-tape recorder in the pocket of an audience member with a bad cold and a most annoying laugh. That the Sante Fe performance was lots of fun can be deduced from the gales of laughter, obviously greeting sight-gags since there is nothing aurally to justify them. The plot etc. is supposed to be given in English by a narrator in between parts of the operetta, but most of it is unintelligible in the poor recording. Almost all of the French cannot be made out also. The Gala booklet, of course, offers no libretto and the track index adds insult to injury by giving the first few words of the numbers with in addition their translatiion into English. (Fat lot of use that is!)Even at the budget price it is not worth wasting your time on this one."
1,All copies should be destroyed...,"As befor said, this recording is terrible. The first description describes it the best. I only wanted to chime in to mention that this CD is so bad that every copy should be destroyed. This is the only CD on the Gala label I have and I refuse to buy anything from them again just because of how bad this is. How can you trust a company that would ever let this pass for sale?"
1,"Yes, it's awful, unfortunately","This one of the really annoying ones.It is entirely possible that there is a good performance going on -- the audience certainly seems to think so. However, the only things the listener is going to get from these discs are frustration and annoyance.Too bad!"
4,intelectual read,This book is not an easy read. It is for the very serious student of the beliefs of the Lakota while they were being forced into the white mainstream. ( which thankfully did not completely occur )The stories and anecdotes are often very interesting but not easy to assimilate.
3,Lakota,"This book is really to indepth for me, not being a Native American. I will one day complete it as I want to understand more of the Lakota Nation"
4,A Well Deserved Portrait,These CDs show a wonderful artist. Grace has an amazing voice and tackles several roles well. Also great is her interpretation of one of Dvorak's song cycle. The treasures in the set are the interviews which I think allow us to hear how Grace interprets her rolls and it shows a bit of sass on her part. Wonderful set for a wonderful artist.
5,Enlightening...,I lived in Los Angeles when Ron Smotherman had his Man/Woman seminars. He was an amazing psychiatrist and author. His books are treasures.
5,Best Ever,"Customer Service was excellent. Delivery was quick. Sausage was delicious!I would definitely order again. My last name is also Esposito, (no relation)but I would order this product under any surname. Thank you."
1,Does not last,I just installed this 3 weeks ago and already the bristles are bent out of shape which looks very shabby.This is the second one I have bought in the past and this will be the last.Years ago I bought one that was just a brush the fit on the very end of the sprayer.It lasted over 15 years without bending out of shape at all. I just wish I could find it again.
5,Excellent Sprayer attachment,"This is a very handy tool. It attatches very tightly to the sprayer, and makes cleaning dishes a snap!"
2,Kitchen sink scrub brush,This is an absolutely fantastic attachment fot the kitchen sink spray unit and works fabulously.
1,Had to Send Back,"The mouse wouldn't connect, the keyboard skipped keys repeatedly. I have never returned a mail order item before this one but it is just THAT bad."
1,worst Holmes ever,this set may appear to be a good deal-10 stories on two dvd's at a modest price--but in this case you get what you pay for-not much!A unique thing about this set-Ronald Howard is without a doubt the worst Holmes of all time--and if that's not enough-H. Marion Crawford is the worst Watson of all time--and as a bonus-Archie Duncan appears as the worst Lestrade of all time. Not trying to kick a dead dog--but the acting and portrayals are about as pathetic as you'll find--spend a little more and get some quality versions of Sherlock Holmes!
1,"Effective Detective, Intellictually Defective Disc Manufacturer","Yet another incomplete copy of the team of Howard and Crawford? 8 Episodes, PLLLLLLEASE. Buy the Mill Creek set, 5 discs, 39 episodes, GREAT PRICE, nuff said."
1,DVD problem-but I like the episodes!,"Although I really like this series set, I have had trouble with the DVD's since purchasing this in May of 2008. Only 2 or three of the DVD's played correctly when I first got the set and I was concerned that it was my player. However, I haven't had trouble with other DVD's and even old ones do fine on my player. All of the discs that had troubles at first have gotten progressively worse over the months. I may try the set again, but will give up if the quality is as bad as the first set I received!"
4,Only half of the collection,"I have the Sherlock Holmes collection on VHS. This DVD version contains only half the episodes that were in the VHS version. My favorites, ""The belligerent ghost"" and ""haunted gainsborough"" were not included in the DVD collection. I hope they will soon be released as a second collection.All that aside, this is a wonderful portrayal of Sherlock Holmes starring Ronald Howard, son of Leslie Howard. It is lighhearted and witty.Be aware that the film quality is only fair. It has been restored from damaged film."
5,Enjoyable,I always enjoy stories that present Sherlock Holmes as the main character. These videos were entertaining.
4,Holmes and Watson in Black and White,"This two disc set, THE SHERLOCK HOLMES COLLECTION, is by far one of the better adaptions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brilliant stories. Ronald Howard and H. Marion Crawford are as close to Holmes and Watson respectively in appearance and portrayal as any pair of actors. The episodes are short, intelligent, and packed with the director's uncanny touches (such as the judge's home and hobby in ""The Case of the Vanished Detective"") and the writer and producer's (Sheldon Reynolds) subtle and blatant humor. The stories lose nothing of their integrity from episode to episode, nor do they slip from their attention to even the smallest details. I was thoroughly impressed with the collection, and, at the inexpensive price for which the set can be purchased, it is simply a must!"
1,DVD quality extremely poor,"The DVD quality of the set I got is very poor - the discs just wouldn't play on my Sony DVD player due to errors. Amazon was great about promptly replacing the first defective DVD set, but the second one was probably worse than the first."
4,Grand Old Shows,"Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Series 3 disc set is fun to watch. The buyer should be aware of the age of the programs which aired in 1954 and 1955 on American TV. Also, please don't look for Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, you won't find many of them.These mostly original stories were produced by Sheldon Reynolds and filmed in France by Guild Films, starring Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard) as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. The production quality is not great, about what one would expect of mid-1950's TV.You will find good, solid `Canonical' stories, just not written by Conan Doyle. Howard makes a hard nose Holmes, he gets better as the first disc goes on and stays great. I think Crawford begins and ends as a stolid, heavy handed Watson as there has been.Over-all, having this collection on my shelf with the other Sherlock Holmes programs is a real bonus for little money.Happyshopper"
1,The Discs almost broke my DVD player,"Although I was a fan of the series, there are major glitches on Discs one and two. I don't know if its an error in the encoding of the discs themselves or what, but basically you get to a point on these discs during the first episode and the entire DVD player shuts down. And then it won't spit out the disc, causing the DVD player to almost break completely.You get what you pay for with this folks. Beware"
3,Sherlock Holmes TV series,"Some of the stories were very clear, others not so clear. Some of the dialogue was very clear, other times not so clear. But I always loved the TV series and am glad I got the set."
2,You can't go home,"I thought this series was pretty neat when viewed through the eyes of an 11 year old in 1955. Unfortunately, when viewed as an adult, spoiled by more modern productions, it comes off as ""Abbott&Costello; Meets Sherlock Holmes."" The stories are either very loosly adapted from Doyle or completely fabricated episodes made to fit a 30 minute time frame. The plots were pretty pathetic,the actors were wooden, and the theme music became irritating after the first episode. Ronald Howard&Marion; Crawford would have made a credable Holmes&Watson; if they had been given decent scripts.If nothing else, this series did plant the seed of a lifelong interest in Holmes. It also pointed out (painfully)how primitive early TV was, how little it took to entertain us, and how far we have come."
3,Interesting,"Although the stories are mostly not taken from the works of Conan Doyle, they are entertaining. Ronald Howard plays a much more friendly type of Holmes, which takes a little getting used to. Rathbone was good as Holmes, but Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes, and no one else comes even close."
1,It's way over-rated!,"This was actually the first story that marked the begining of Chris Claremont's trend of trying to do four or five different little stories all in one over-blown crossover. The theme of Jean grey being transformed into a vastly powerful being that sets out to destroy the universe was repeated 16 years later with Charles Xavier becoming Onslaught (please). It also started the trend of dead characters later coming back to life, but that's another story in of itself. The X-Men animated series recently did an adaptation of this story for television, and it wasn't much better. You want to read a good Marvel story, try the Fantastic Four; Coming of Galactus saga, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby"
4,Intervention,"Compiled into a (more or less) complete collection, Chris Claremont and John Burne's classic story follows the team as they reluctantly battle a possessed Jean Grey to save the universe. Having only seen this saga in other media, this has more depth than the animated series and way more than the live-action movies, when you look past the exhausting amount of dialogue and the improvised climax. Covering issues 129-137 of ""Uncanny X-Men,"" the saga features the debut of Kitty Pride, the Dazzler, and Emma Frost; the return of Angel and Beast, and even a special appearance by the Watcher. The reader is also treated to a reissued cover gallery and original artwork.This comic is rated T: Violence, Adult Situations."
5,Wow.,"""X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga"" is by far one of the most emotionally gripping superhero comics ever. Jean Grey is a very power-ful mutant, and when she uses her powers to it's maximum potential, her personality gets controlled by the phoenix, and this is the story of what happens."
4,Another must-buy X-Men collection,"This book collects the integral Dark Phoenix saga told in the pages of Uncanny X-Men. Definately a good buy for classic comic enthusiasts, and also includes an introduction by Stan Lee."
1,rip off company,I thought I was getting a good deal. I then learned that they were going to over charge me for the shipping. The knives cost twice as much as they said when you add the shipping.
4,Christian Romance Period Piece,"I used to read these as a young adult and now, in my sixites, I started re-reading Grace Livingston Hill. I am not a ""born again"" Christian but I love these old novels for their sense of history, for a culture and values not-outdated today, in spite of what people would like to believe. Also in this book the heroine goes with her husband to see a demonstration of a ""new technology"", a steam engine railroad. So many of the attitudes expressed are so similar to what people put forth today when confronted with a radical new thing, fear, awe, disbelief that it could be useful, to people with vision who say, we don't know how this will play out, but WOW let's explore it. God had a way of handing us knowledge we aren't quite ready to embrace, but He knows we cannot grow spiritually without. Lots of lessons in GLH's novel that are so applicable today."
4,Delightful story of early american values,I enjoyed this book as well t s well written with a good story plot and well developed characters. The moral fibre is what were missing in today's society.
5,Captivating,This book evokes emotions and a curiosity that keeps you reading. I am glad I chose this book. Truly romantic!
4,Marcia schuler,I was much pleased as to how the story progressed. Especially how feelings can become changed and loved as we become acquainted with a person. Wonderful story involving a humble and true heart.
4,Extraordinary lyrical and outstanding voice,"Eleni Mandell puts an enormous sense of dispair in her songs, it are right out dirctly from a decadent urban environment."
2,"banal, bland","this is the sort of banal, bland unoriginal stuff that derivitive , superfluous singer/songwriter/ego-on-wheels people like Mandell perpetrate all the time. her slavish, embarrasing devotion to the pj harvey bandwagon is all the more laughable given that the songs are ludicrously unimaginative and simplistic (rather than being simple, which, of course, is an altogether different prospect--and a, potentially at least, good one). not in this case. if you're bored you're going to be even more so if you throw your money away on CDs like this."
5,A lovely end to a thought-provoking series.,"A work of art... written almost as if she were writing for herself rather than for her readers, as if she were concentrating on creating a good book as opposed to just a popular one..."
3,"Last book in the ""Cat"" series","A good book with a bummer ending. Not surprising, I suppose, since the theme of this novel is the near impossibility of surviving as an outsider in a world governed by the corporate state.Cat's a sweet character who somehow manages to be a bridge between peoples, but also manages to find himself alone & disregarded.This is a book filled with longing - for community, for change, for love, for companionship, for a way to be whole. Vinge writes interesting characters & the plot here is nicely character driven, although she doesn't really do anything with the cloud whales and their dreamfall - odd to set up such a cool premise & then just sort of leave it there.This is the third book of a trilogy and I think I like the second one, Catspaw, best. The characters, landscape, & ideas are more diverse - alien, but not alien all at once."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dreamfall is a sequel to Catspaw, or part of a series, however you wantto look at it. This time, Cat is on his mother's planet, and prettymuch immediately gets into trouble, something he is really very goodat. Yet again, a huge corporation is controlling a substance, and heruns afoul of them and their aims. Not really a big surprise. Catbecomes involved in the struggle, and is naturally on his mother'speople's side, not the megacorp."
3,Another Cat tale.,I found this volume disappointing. It's slow-moving and probably could have been cut by half if Cat's often tedious internal musings had been shorn some. Not nearly as good as CATSPAW.
3,"Interesting, but......","I've always liked the Cat series, but I think it has stagnated a bit. I mean, I'm getting a little tired of the ""poor little whipping boy"" routine. The series has GREAT potential, it just hasn't lived up to it yet. Too many loose ends get created and never really brought to a conclusion. Like Why he has DRACO's logo, who's his father, or just who ARE the Others and where did they go? Maybe in the next book (if there ever is one) the author will get around to tying up these loose threads..."
2,Should Be Good,"This book should be good, in theory I liked the premise for the story. But once I started to read it I found that the characters lacked depth and I just wanted to skip past everything to find out the end so I could be done with the book. The Bird was shallow and uninteresting.Ultimately the book was full of possibility but didn't even begin to live up to it."
2,suffers the flaws of a first novel,"Hopefully this author will improve with time. This outing, however, has somewhat flat, one-dimensional characters. The first few pages are top-heavy with backstory to get us up to speed, and in many places the same information is given repeatedly; as the character struggles to accept the goshawk companion, she goes through the same argument again and again. Much could be trimmed for clarity and speed. Also there are some convenient ""as you know"" moments, where the main character just *happened* to be in a place where she could overhear conversation that serves only to give information to the reader. And why ARE the healers called ""tarks,"" anyway? What's wrong with calling them healers?"
1,not that great,"I'm actually just writing because there was one thing that just kept popping into my head throughout most of the novel: Mary Sue. The main character is extremely one dimensional I find, something I noticed others said as well although they seem to be outnumbered by a whole bunch of people that probably just came off the high of just finishing a novel. I would suspect that if the people read the book again and thought about it, they'd most likely come to different conclusions and give different reviews. The book does have a fairly decent premise, not something too origional, but that's hard to come by. The characters as I said, are cookie cut-outs, while the problems they face seem more of an excuse than the actual plot. Book is alright if you are looking for something to pass the time, otherwise... well you might want to find something else"
4,Good product,"I love the concept and like the product. The sticky tape came off once already (I have it on the inside of a cabinet door, so I don't want to screw it in), but currently it's holding up well. Good size for storing in the cabinet like I have, but I wish it was a little bit wide to fit more bags. Overall, I'm pleased with the product."
5,Thanks seven brothers and Amazon!,"Wow,What a great deal I was expecting a hand held stick flag and received a flag bigger than myself. Ordering this Senegal National Country Flag was a bang for my buck!"
4,Good Value,"Made great party favors. I was a little worried because there wasn't a picture, but the cookies came just how I expected. Love how they are individually wrapped with the ingredient list. I just put one in the goody bags for each guest. Pretty good tasting too."
3,Not a book to lift your spirits,"This is the story of the life of Amy Lowell from about age 4 until her early twenties. This is not an easy book to read. First of all, it's over 600 pages long and full of politics and war. There are many tradegies throughout this book -- in fact almost all are. The Lowell family is extremely atypical. There are almost no happy parts to this book. I wanted to like it because I liked the characters very much especially Amy and Nick, but it was too depressing. Even the ending wasn't what I would have liked it to be although probably true to life."
2,terrible,"i was turned off this book about the 3rd chapter. the ""hero"" slaps the main woman. i may be able to handle many things but abuse against someone weaker is just sickening. the worst part is that from this point theyre supposed to come to love each other. immediately after this she is forced to stay in his bed and they have sex and she puts up little to no resistance! this just annoyed me that the whole situation was just dismissed. i cant come to love a hero who hits a woman."
3,Entertaining- Sort of,"I have always liked Hannah Howell. This is an entertaining read. If it was one of the first books that I have ever read from this author I would probably be rating it higher. After reading many of her books it begins to feel like the same story different character names.I liked Ailis. She had spunk.Strong, extremely handsome Laird meets beautiful, feisty lass and eventually falls in love. Same story many, many times over. But what else do we want in a romance novel?I thought it was kind of weird how Ailis never really interacts with her newborn at all. He is hardly mentioned toward the end. Also, the betrayal with Malcolm seemed a bit much to me. I did enjoy Jamie & the children."
4,Stars Good Book,I thought this was a very good read. I'm not sure what one of the reviewers was talking about when she stated that the hero said that he could not be faithful to her (Ailis)at the end of the book. I did not see that at all so that's not true it had the typical ending as all romance novels. Pick this one up it's a must read.
2,"Not 20 ounces, very light weight.","I purchased this pitcher to suppliment my 16 ounce pitcher, which is too small for our weekend large Latte's. When this pitcher arrived, I found that it does NOT hold 20 ounces. It only holds 18 ounces, which is just 1 ounce more than my too-small ""16 ounce"" pitcher. This pitcher is also of noticably thinner metal, and does not feel like quality. This proves again that it is usually true that yo uget what you pay for. This picture is lower in price for real reasons. The great news is that, as always, Amazon.com was great about accepting the return of this pitcher."
1,16 ounces not 20!,I couldn't believe how small my new 20 ounce frothing pitcher was so I filled it from a measuring cup. It holds a perfect 16 ounces. It is going back.
2,A Disappointment,"I have enjoyed other Klein's products, and am a certified pumpkin seed eater. But these are mediocre, at best. On the surface, they look nice: Big seeds, natural appearing and not over-bleached.. but the dry roasting process is poorly done. It's mostly a struggle to get the seed from the shell, if you like to eat them that way. Also, I found the salt to be overloaded. In short, you can do much better."
1,Yuck!,"Sorry but l tried. These were the worst tasting pumpkin seeds that l have ever had. l wanted something with less salt yet NOT unsalted but these were not good. Both my mom and l did not like them. lf you like a total dry roasted ONLY taste then these are for you, if not...try the David brand, they are perfectely salted unlike some that are way over salted and feel almost like sand paper. Hey, you don't know until you try."
1,Chintzy Packaging,I had to throw away 4 of the 6 packages I bought since the quality of the packaging was so poor. I can't even comment on the product since it was stale when I got it. I will not buy these again.
4,Dr.,Good size roasted seeds with a good amount of salt. Much larger than anything I can find in the store and an overall better value.
4,el Salvador fllag,this was great. :-) didnt get here on the date it said it would but overall very happy with the purchase
3,TOMBSTONES WEARY,"he stumbles around the corner ,the LATE EARLY TOO LATE, MORNING AFTER,musses a near blur and releases some{ NUGGETS] HIDDEN WITHIN THE DRISSLE far,off from even least BEST , his one joke story SORRY STONED monologues OF himself in despair."
3,Marriage of Virtue & Viciousness Review,"At least this book got back on track for the trilogy, this time the story focusing on Simon Birch and the Prince. It was better and I can hope that White Wolf will consider putting out more novels for the other game lines."
5,"Brilliant punk-pop, fast, melodic and catchy.","A fantastic cd from start to finish. Every song is catchy and memorable, and played with speed and passion. Touches of horns and keyboard fillout the guitar/bass/drum attack."
4,British compilation hits the spot,"Excellent overview of some very well known and not well known garage talents,well mixed and worth buying if you enjoy New York music of the Blaze,Althea Mc Queen,Paul Simpson,Roland Clark type.Soulful vocals which cut through the rubbish that passes for ""current"" style.If anyone out there knows where to get a copy of ""The Garage Sound of Deepest New York""please let me know.Thanks"
1,Poor Construction,"I purchased 4 of these chair. The quality control is horrible. One in 5 holes lined up, making the chairs difficult to assemble. In addition, one chair arrived with the front facing board broken."
3,Very Difficult Leg Assembly,"Good chair, but do not buy if you are not patient and REALLY like to assembly things out of the box. The drilled bolt holes have been poorly engineered in Vietnam and are very difficult to line up for the assembly."
5,Very Nice Chair,"I looked everywhere for thsi classic Adirondack Chair. Amazon was the last place I looked, I was desperate and I found this chair and snapped it up.This chair exceeded my expectations in all ways. It is well made, easy to put together and arrived in two days for $7 in shipping. The wood is beautiful with a very nice smooth hand.I purchased one as a gift and will get another!"
1,"Written overall in a bad style, with an uncreative plot.","Golding does an excellent paroday of this ""book"" with Lord of the Flies. The only good part is the description. I found that the story dragged on and on. The plot was so unoriginal! I've read a lot of adventure stories, but this was the worst. It makes me feel like just anybody can go off and write an adventure story, and a hundred years later its called a classic. Don't read this - read the best adventure story ever - The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne."
1,Ballantynes' loosely created Utopia,"R.M.Ballantynes' coral island is typical of Victorian age novels with loose and incoherent plot,lifeless & flat characters and involving a deep religious fervour.No doubt the credit goes to the writer for his first-hand knowledge about trees and his vivid description of the islands beauty and its surroundings.But at the same time, the author is to be castigated for creating characters whose chastiness supercedes that of Christ.Half naked girls fail to arouse them sexually.The barbaric fights in which they indulged with the savages did not affect their mentality and they remained jovial throughout the novel.I believe that the critics who declared it as a classical novel were either the relatives of the author or were paid by him."
4,The Coral Island,"I thought that this book was great to read. This story is about a kid and some pirates. They land on a coral island and the island is basically forest. This book has a lot of great sentence like for a time the schooner stood it bravely, and sprang foreword against the rising sea like a war horse. Also like at the same moment Bill lost his hold of the belaying-pin which had served to steady him, and he slid with stunning violence against the skylight"
5,A very enthralling book......,"After reading this book about 5 times I have got into the routine of reading it again every summer as it reminds me of holidays and the sun. It really is a good book, it is a typical Adventure story and anybody ...even adults will love it. I am coming on 17 now and i still have not grown out of it!"
5,Excellent Book for Young Teenage Boys! Really grabs them.,"I read this book when I was about 13 years oldI am now 51. This book turned me from a boredyoung teenager to a world traveler(thru reading), and a dedicated reader."
2,Much data but difficult to read and unreferenced.,"J. Murray includes a lot of data and anecdotes, but little references for his work. Good reading for ""preaching to the choir"", but lacks substance for any rational discussion. Also, the reading is very confusing and difficult to follow his points."
2,A badly organized argument,"The subject of firearms is a controversial one and articles arguing for and against all too often drown the reader in the authors' biases and emotions. To his credit, the author has tried to be impartial and objective (but not quite succeeding). There are a lot of facts and figures here but they are badly organized and the conclusions and arguments don't seem to take into account the increasing lawlessness of society today.The hard facts are that criminals will always be able to get firearms, being already in contempt of law by their very profession. This and other important aspects of the equation such as education (we are far more likely to encounter a firearm in daily life than ever) are left out. A more balanced study and discussion would have made it a better book."
4,Great Camera - no sound,This camera has a very appealing body design. It is comfortable and easy to grip. The pictures are outstanding. It adjusted well to poor indoor lighting conditions. The movie format produces great pictures as well. I have friends with 2.1Mpixel cameras and the movies are not as good a quality. The only downfall is that the camera doesn't have any sound features. This is disappointing when using the movie mode.
4,This is a 5 Star (PLUS) Camera Without Sound,"This camera shoots perfection. The manual controls are fantastic and the video quality is as good as it gets. I have been shooting an Olympus and The FD 93 Mavica. The Fuji 4900 out performs them hands down. However the major dissapointment was perfect video AND NO SOUND! O.K. it is a ""still"" camera but with the video capibilitty sound would have been the right move. If you do not care about sound or voice overs for for commerical work or talking captions buy this camera....I truly wish I would have waited a generation and got the sound feature. The Fuji FinePix 4900 is a greater than 5 star camera as such but I gave it 4 stars because Fuji dropped the ball in regard to the sound."
3,"battery time, memory capacity","I use my camera for work. Battery time is shortand must be longer. I need a min. of two 64 meg memory sticks. 128 or 256 or cd rom would be very nice and would be very helpful. I am waiting for next generation before I buy. Please hurry with the upgrades for memory, battery and lens options. Low light photos are a priority also. get off the stump and move fwd. I want to buy, but want what I need.Thanks Dave"
4,Better be computer savvy,"This camera takes some really great pictures and videos BUT, if you aren't a computer whiz, you better know someone that is to download the .avi video files because neither the owners manual nor the software users guide mention ANYTHING relative to getting the .avi videos on your hard drive to save them.Installation of the camera and viewer software is a breeze but after that, your on your own to figure out saving videos.Something that is not mentioned in advertising is that theres a warning in the owners manual about using it in the desert(which is where I live,LOL). Oh well we shall see."
4,finepix4900-,"A fine camera, easy to use after minimal reading.Most features are almost intuitive,or can be figured out by the icons on the body.The 4900 does not handle fast moving subjects to well,often missing the shot altogether.You have to pan with a closed shutter on the burst mode(5 shots) and hope you get the good one in the frame.Other than that it is a super camera,doing every thing very well."
4,"For $50.00, I Ain't Complaining :)","If You thought Chung's review was late, mine is much later, just got this camera off EBAY for $50.00, seller said the batteries only lasted 3-5 mins and included two spare NP 80 batteries, the wide angle lens and adapter and a nice case for $50.00. I found out the ""battery problem: was the camera's auto shut-off setting after 3-5 mins. I'm not saying the batteries last a long time, far from it and as everybody has stated, get an extra one as they warning light did start blinking after about 60 shots. Took some amazing shot using macro and flash together. Good camera if you can get a package deal like I did along with some Smartmedia cards with it too, too expensive to buy alone."
5,Excellent reference for medical transcriber or coder,This paperback handbook is a compact reference for medical acronyms and abbreviations. It is small but rugged for constant desk use. There are hundreds of common and hard-to-find abbreviations that appear in doctor's shorthand and patient chart notations. Medical transcriptionists and medical coders will find this handbook very valuable in deciphering surgery and anesthesia records. I recommend this book for every medical office or homeworker.
4,Psycho Killer Qu'est-ce que sais,"Firstly, I would like to note that I plan on revising this review later on.Now in regards to the play ""Down the Road"" it is neither a masterpiece or a work of atrocity, rather it is a play involving a unique character study. The character I speak of is Reach, a confined serial killer. The play revolves around two reporters/journalists, who happen to be married, as they make a case study on Reach through a series of interviews which lead to various problems and oddities in their relationship.The reason I give this play four stars is merely because of the interesting moments with Reach, which possess a keen insight into an obvious psychopath. While the actions that drive the play are perhaps lacking, and the development of the two other main characters are a bit flat, the play provides an interesting read, and a challenge for the actors who choose to perform it."
2,Certainly not worth what they are asking,"These sunglasses are very comfortable to wear. In fact they are likely the most comfortable glasses I've ever owned. Having said that, I am otherwise extremely disappointed with these sunglasses. They do not cut glare or improve visability any better than a pair of 25 dollar shades. I also found my pair to be of extremely poor construction. The lens cracked after about a month. I've owned good sunglasses before such as Ray Bans so I know what to expect from a pair of high end sunglasses and these don't even come close. I would say that these sunglasses are on par with a pair of 20 dollar shades you find on the rack at a department store. There is a one year warranty with these so I will return them for a new pair but the next pair will definitely be ray bans or oakleys."
2,Avid Reader,"While the beginning of the book and its wonderful prose really grabbed me, the middle and end had me wondering where it was all going--did the author really get lost himself as the plot did? I also found all the flowery descriptions along the way a distraction from the point being made, if there was one! All in all, it was a good summer read but lacking in cohesion."
2,Book Review - Pocket Full of Names,"I found this book very engrossing at first, than it just jumps around from past to present to much, not my kind of story. Someone else may love it. The author needed to continue the story the way it began."
3,Dull,"I've always liked Joe Coomer's work, but this time, I could barely finish the novel. Coomer's strength has always been his unique characters, people that are very human. In this book, the characters are flat; they talk endlessly of big issues--love, sex, art, religion, abuse. There is no character development, only situations that call for more uninteresting dialogue. The only character that has any personality is the senile grandfather. The book's just plain dull."
4,Coomer and the Maine islands grab you,"I am an avid reader, yet, I had not heard of Joe Coomer. I live in Maine, and a local bookshop owner showed a proof copy of the book to me and said, ""You have to read this book,"" and so I did. The book was a delight! Not only is the story full of twists, turns, memorable characters (you will fall in love with Mr. Beal, and a Black Labrador Retriever), it is a wonderful depiction of life on one of Maine's many islands. The surrounding areas, the sea, lobster fishing are all described in accurate and charming detail.If you've ever longed to visit Maine, if you love the sea and its mysteries, if you've ever wondered what it's like to live on an island, if you love animals, if you want to be spellbound from beginning to end of a book, and if you want to take a memorable journey with Hannah, add Joe Coomer to your own pocketful of names."
5,always intriguing,"This is the sixth or seventh Coomer novel I've read. It's his best. The characterizations are subtle, the revelations are extraordinary and ordinary. The setting is as always lovingly explored. I like Coomer for the way he writes, not necessarily what he writes about, but the themes he explores here hit home with me: losing what you love and carrying on. It's a truly adult novel that I'll go back to again and again."
4,Fun read. Suitable for your Nana too!,"I find it difficult to find good books to read that I can also pass along to my elderly Nana. Too much violence and overly detailed sex is so commonplace (don't get me wrong, I read it, and enjoy much of it too), but know that she would reject it after reading a few pages.This book POCKET FULL OF NAMES is for everyone. A really fun read! (without being sickeningly sweet).I've read most of his other books (favorite is BEACHCOMBING FOR A SHIPWRECKED GOD)"
5,A Pocketful of Names,I am a New Englander and I spend alot of time on the coast of Maine so I absolutely loved this book because of the local settting. The story was well written and it kept my attention throughout the whole book. It was one of those books I didn't want to put down. All of the characters were very believable and the story itself could very well have happened. I enjoyed this book completely...
4,Good Enough & Looks great,"These are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed. I like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. My one ""issue"" with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary, and don't have a tilting feature. That might be standard, I just don't know, but I would have wanted that flexibility. Oh, and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. And they're simple to put together and take apart. Great price and they block the sun and look terrific."
3,Plastic,"Upon receipt of the umbrella, I was disappointed to find that the finial and supporting collar for the wooden ribs were made of plastic. Had I known of this before hand, I would have not place the order.To top it off, I may be charged for the return postage!"
4,Oxford Garden Market Umbrella,We are pleased with our recent purchase. We were surprised that it came through the US mail service. It did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella.
1,Base support broken,"In windy city chicago, My umbrella was fallen only one time because of heavy wind. Please make sure you use table for that"
2,Top-heavy Umbrella,"I have used this umbrella for almost one year in tropical Florida. As advertised, the umbrella comes in two pieces which must screwed together. The top piece is really too heavy for the supporting bottom piece. The fittings are solid-looking brass, but appearances can be deceiving. When the two pieces are screwed together, the umbrella is not straight because of the weight of the top. I am using the umbrella with the companion Oxford umbrella base and a glass/aluminum table. It was very difficult for two people to set up the umbrella because of its large size and weight. It has proved impossible to align the umbrella so that it stands straight. The bottom shaft is straight, but the weight of the top causes it to lean no matter how it is positioned. The polyester fabric has held up well under the Florida sun, but I cannot recommend this product because it is inherently unstable and may tip over. It could and probably would do considerable damage to anything in its path."
1,THIS IS A CROOKED DEAL,Both umbrella and stand seemed to be well made but when I mated them the umbrella was crooked. Apparently the umbrella pole was the problem. This item was too large to bother returning so I kept the item and am not a very happy camper. DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE. Buy something like this from a local merchant so if there is a problem you can make an easy return.
1,stand doesnt support the umbrella,"beware: according to the oxford garden tech, the stand for the nine ft umbrella will not support properly without the additional support of a table! i found this out when i called complaining about the plastic finial that was sent. the umbrella sent was not as pictured. fortunately was able to return to amazon without incident."
2,Good space saver...doesn't open very well,"The spice rack is a great space saver in the kitchen. However, it is VERY difficult to open. When you can finally force it open, it often dumps the spices out."
3,installation problems,"This product was a practical buy to help freeup some cabinet space, yet not use counter space. This rack is a good idea, however, attaching it to the cabinet was very, very difficult. I finally had to take it apart inorder to attach it. The diagram provided for the installation made it look easy, but it was anything but easy. The drawer does not drop down low enough to allow you to screw in the screw. If you have solid wood cabinets, you need a drill; there is no room for the drill. The concept is great, but it probably should come in parts so the base can be attached first, then the drop down drawer."
5,I Love This Thing!,"I purchased theth Flight Stick for myself for Christmas and have had a blast using it ever since. The manufacturing quality of the unit is excellent and the adjustable grip rests for your hand aids significantly in finding your most comfortable grip. My favorite feature (next to the unit being wireless)is the feel of the unit while in use, especially flying. The twist grip is also very handy for rudder control and has an unexpectedly (rudders are normally operated by your feet) natural feel...great product!"
4,"Awesome company, great joystick.","I bought this joystick a couple of days ago, and as soon as I got it, I set it up and was playing in about 10 minutes. I am always impressed with saitek's products, and it was no dirrerent this time. Works well a good distance away from the reciever, which is smaller than most jumpdrives. And what is even better, the stick base has a built in holder for the reciever. The only thing that i gave this 4 stars for is because it is very light. I wasnt really expecting this, but I think it is something i can get used to. All in all i think this a very well made stick, extremely portable, and looks good too. I highly recommend this stick or any of the other great saitek joysticks."
1,Connectivity problems...,"It's possible that the problem was with this specific unit, but the joystick was subject to frequent disconnections apparently tied to RF interference. Despite changing the joystick's channels and using numerous alternate batteries, as well as removing most interfering devices away (really, only 3 nearby items transmitting on the 2.4 gHz range), the stick still proved to be too intermittent. Subsequent purchase of the Logitech equivalent proved to be more stable, without any interference.This is a shame, too, as the stick was built beautifully. It certainly has a superior throttle control to the Logitech, as well as a great layout and overall construction quality. The Saitek software works quite well, and the profiler was easy to use. The movement on the stick was also quite solid, being superior, in fact, to the overly light touch required for the Saitek X52."
1,unrequited hardware lust,"I really liked my old Sidewinder 3D Pro, but it's become a problem getting the new operating systems to recognize it on the still great but aging Creative Live Drive gameport. I've lusted for the Saiteks. So I got this wireless one to continue uncluttering my desk. I'm tall and have big hands, so I thought an adjustable one would be cool.Beefs:1. It had a dead stick button out of the box. In searching for another controller, I've noticed others Saitek reviewers had dead button problems. A switch with wires is not rocket science folks.2. I tried it with the games I'm playing and no amount of adjustment made using it comfortable. If my hands were half again as large, maybe. Who user tests this stuff?3. Throttle is hard to use where it is.I sent it back and got a refund.The ""any but Saitek quest"" goes on."
2,Saitek Cyborg Evo Wireless,"Nice joystick, but I found it to be a very glitchy stick. Did not always do what I was asking it to do (i.e. not firing or rotating until several seconds after initiating the action). I also found myself having to ""reset"" the stick very often by removing the batteries and reinstalling them. I would not recomend this stick. I cannot offer any other suggestions for a wireless stick since I replaced it with the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro. The Logitech has been great and gets 5 stars from me and it costs less."
1,Inferior substitute for Allsop Expandable CD Organizer,"It holds only 16 NOT 50 CDs. It takes up a lot of space on the desktop. It doesn't stack. It doesn't expand (they don't fit together) due to its outside shape. You can't cart them around, the black plastic separates from the brown plastic.It looks like I'll either have to go to Case Logic products and/or find another vendor."
1,Disappointed in quality,"The stick is not varnished, so is rough on the surface. It will not survive the use I need it for, as when wet will split. The ADL sticks I have had in the past were finished with sufficient varnish to last for a minimum of 4 years. This will be returned."
5,Great relaxing music !,This Title which contain only 6 tracks is a great relaxing music. One that can be listened to repeatedly without the risk of getting bored with it. A great way to relax after a long day at work or when ever you feel the need to just sit quietly and do nothing.
4,A Nice Change,"Mark Ellis's latest was very good. This series needed change. I just wish he would have continued with kane's and Brigid's intense feelings for one another.That seems to be stagnating now. I agree with a couple of sharp-eyed reviewers here who stated that some of the battles were not very believable. The ship was described as being so intelligent and all-powerful, but couldn't kill a couple of Magistrate humans...?As a female, I'd like to see a bit more sex and romance that Ellis only seems to hint at nowadays. Need to really move it along when it comes to the main characters romancing, Mr. Ellis."
4,The serpent's hiss,"Another Mark Ellis achievement.Not bad Ellis, but there were major problems in this one. When the trio were onboard the illustrious and oh-so-intelligent starship, with newly-created barons, stronger and bigger and badder than ever - along with a fully armored army of drones - how could kane and his comrades without their Mag armor win the day?That was crap. Ellis wrote this ship to be timeless and all powerful, now holding a large group of aline killers - but yet an unarmored small group of three can withstand all this...?I don't think so. Milan's action sequences are written much better. Ellis is good, but he needs to tighten up with these types of scenes.And enough of the goody, goody, no-sex garbage. This is a world filled with danger and death around the next corner. Get this Kane and Brigid together, huh? This series needs that hard-boiled sex and violence that old-time Deathlands used to have."
1,TERRIBLE SOUND,"There is no way to judge the artistic merits of this performance, as one almost cannot hear the singers at all. The orchestra is loud, the coughing is incessant (I think even the person recording the performance is coughing!), and the performers are heard from quite a distance. All in all, this is a huge disappointment, particularly since I would have LOVED to hear Caballe in her prime (1967) sing Cleopatra."
3,For caballé's Clepatra.,"There are many better recordings of this famous opera. This one is an opportunity to listen the seductive Cleopatra sung by the amazing Montserrat Caballé, who knows what ""bel canto"" means, even when it's not Bellini or Donizetti. She is great here !"
1,Just a clock,The automatic time update just doesn't work. Neither does the DST. It works as a clock that one would normally set manually. I'm returning it and going to get a regular wall clock for half the price.
1,Bad Times! Bad Support!,"Bought the product and took my time opening the package. Turned out defective but past Amazon return policy time. Contacted manufacturer. Was told to return it, but I had to pay shipping. So I emailed them about the shipping expense they were imposing on me for their defective clock, but they just ignored my repeated emails. Got second clock. Around Christmas it started going haywire by constantly rotating and only stopping when I pulled the battery. Contacted manufacturer by phone. Took them a week to get back to me via email asking more questions and asking me to return clock BUT PAY AGAIN FOR SHIPPING. I am spending more on shipping their defective clocks back to them than if I just went to the local drug store and bought a wall clock. Once again they are ignoring my email about shipping cost. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Works great in Seattle,Found the signal and updated itself right away. It is off by up to a couple of minutes now and then but resets itself. That is close enough for me.
3,Second Hand Broke,Used for a bathroom clock. Keeps good time and has held up well except the second hand broke after about 90-days.
4,using it for 2 years,using it for 2 years and did not find major issues.some minor issues are during the transition period when the day light time sets in.
1,Doesn't run on time,"I bought this clock just because I needed a wall clock. When it arrived, it didn't work because the second hand kept hitting the minute hand. So I took the front cover off and bent the hands so that they didn't touch. When I replaced the cover it stopped running again, so I left the cover off. The atomic setting has never worked at all, unless that is the reason that the time is always incorrect. What I wanted was just a cheap wall mounted battery operated clock that kept accurate time. What I got was totally different."
5,Great! Simple!,"This clock was so easy to set up. Just follow the simple instructions and it basically sets itself. Perfect time. Very, very pleased!"
1,Terrible customer service - won't fix clocks under warranty,"I purchased 4 of these clocks in February 2008. 2 of those work as advertised, and 2 of them stopped working after 12 days. The minute hand just keeps winding rapidly, about twice a minute, instead of showing time. I called La Crosse support, and the lady who answered had me press the manual setting button 20 times and asked me to remove the battery, wait for 20 minutes, put the battery back on and leave the clock near a window. She said they will not replace the clocks under warranty, and that I had to ship the clocks back to them for testing and confirmation that it was not user error! The clock set itself to the right time overnight after that, and the second hand stopped moving later that day. I called customer service again, and they are yet to return my call 4 days after I left them a voice mail. Do not buy this POS product until you call LaCrosse first to see if you can get through to their product support."
5,Works as advertised,When I was looking at this clock I wanted to see if they worked out the bugs. Reading the reviews I saw they did have an issue with this clock and DST. I purchased one 3 days before DST change. I put it on the wall on my basement and it had the time set within a couple hours. A couple nights later it was time to change the clocks to DST and I was happy to see the clock changed time when I checked it the next morning.In short if you are wondering if the resolved the DST issue it appears so. I would recommend this clock.Happy Shopping!
1,Nice looking clock but does not work properly.,I really like the look of this clock. So I was really looking forward to getting this clock based on some of the reviews. It adjusted over night to the correct time but after a few days the second hand clock stopped working. Then after a couple more days the clock stopped working. I then got a replacement through Amazon but then the same thing started to happen with the new one. I really wanted this clock to work...sigh... Now I have to return this one and find a whole new clock. Any suggestions...
2,needs a window to work,"I bought 3 of these for my office, which has very few windows. It couldn't catch a signal in the rooms I had placed them (kitchen, conference room, and front desk- none of which have windows), so after a week, I returned them and got regular clocks. The atomic technology just doesn't seem worth it when you can buy a regular clock and not have to worry about where you hang it."
2,Died in less a year. Simple idea. Bad quality,This was a nice clock when it worked. Died in less than 1 year. Steer away. I also bought another one with a digital display and weather monitor from the same manufacturer but still works well so far.
1,Do n't buy this clock,This is a poor product. I bought it last September and it has stopped working. Of course yuou can only return it within a few weeks. Very dissatisfied. Denis
5,La Crosse Technology WT-3102S,Accurate and secure - Love it :-)Fits in the space perfectly :-))))Recommend it highlyThanks for the referral sister-dear - :-)
1,radio never worked here in SF,"We tried to get the radio-controlled setting working here in downtown San Francisco, but it never worked. Also tried in Palo Alto but same problem -- so we ended up setting it manually."
1,This clock STINKS - DO NOT BUY IT AT ANY PRICE,"The product is terrible. Takes forever to set time, when it does work it picks the wrong time. I have two. One sets the wrong time (even changes it when you manually set it), the other just keeps spinning around and around for hours. VERY poor reception. We have three or four other atomic clocks that have no trouble getting reception but these two are LOUSY LOUSY LOUSY - DO NOT BUY THIS CLOCK!!!!"
3,Amusement value is high; accurate timekeeping is questionable,"We have four of these clocks. First we bought one, thought it was really neat, and then bought three more.Every clock has quirks. One refused to set the right time zone--and we live in Fort Collins, CO, home of the atomic clock. Telling the clock to set the time for another zone and then changing back to Mountain Time solved that one. That clock worked fine for two and one-half years. Now it's four hours slow. The same trick didn't work a second time. Removing the battery and reinserting it made the clock set the right time--for a few hours. Then it was back to four hours slow.Two clocks spun their hands through twelve hours. One did this regularly at 4:00 for weeks but has stopped. After that escapade, the second hand is stuck. The other clock completely died.The fourth clock's second hand never worked but the clock does keep time.The clocks are great for amusement value but that isn't why you usually buy a clock."
4,Good Product with some flaws.,"Keep time very very accurately (as it should since it's atomic clock) but ""Second"" hand keep getting stuck and freezes from the first day i opened the box. battery life is excellent but material is not so top quality (but what should i expect from $15 or $20 clock?) I purchase this clock in july 2008.But i have to admit, this clock still working so i guess it is a plus.Update 1 (April 13, 2012): I just fixed the ""Second Hand"" and now everything works fine. I found out due design flaw in resetting this clock many other folks have the same problem but now after 3-4 years, It's perfect again."
1,Worthless,"This clock was worthless. The second hand stopped moving after a couple of months and the times zones buttons a couple of weeks after that. You have to pay shipping to get fixed, which is lot compared to the price of the clock."
4,They work fine,"Bought 3 of them. 2 are accurate to the minute. 1 is 1 min slower. Not bad at all. I'm in Rockville, MD 20850. The silver bezel looks rather cheap. (LOL, it is cheap plastic after all.) May not appear as silver to some ppl."
1,Daylight Savings Time Nightmare!,"Not the manufacturer's fault, I blame U.S. Congress for this....The clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier DST change this year. There was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and/or clock that we just returned the clocks. Disappointed."
2,The secondhand stopped working,"After a few months secondhand stopped working being stuck at 12 o'clock. The time still seems correct and the adjustment for daylight savings time still works, but the secondhand doesn't move."
2,"Good clock, except for...","The clock still keeps perfect time since it gets set via the atomic clock in Boulder, CO. The only thing about it is that the second hand stopped ticking a few months after I put it on the wall. Not a real big deal since it still keeps time, but kind of annoying. I paid money for a clock with a second hand which no longer works."
2,30% defective rate,"We order 18 of these for our office so we wouldn't have to set the clocks 2x a year and they would all be in sync... Of the 18, 5 had to be sent back because they would not update correctly. Of the 5 replacements 2 had to go back again... So that is 25 clocks of which 7 were defective or just shy of 1 out of every 3 was no good."
2,"Inexpensive, but problematic","I've had one of these clocks for about 2 years. I may have gotten my $20 use out of it, but not more. It started off by being an hour off. Since I live on the west coast, I could not just select a different time zone to fix the problem. So I ended up opening the case and adjusting the hands manually for the initial install. After that, I had to select a different time zone when the time changed from daylight savings time to standard time.Now, the clock has started advancing continuously as though it is trying to reset itself to the correct time. So, I am going to throw it away and buy another clock -- probably NOT one made by La Crosse!Admittedly, I have not contacted the manufacturer about either of these problems -- for $20 it hardly seemed worth my time to even call.On the positive side, the clock looks good and maintained the correct time for two years, with the exception of having to manually change it twice a year."
1,Don't drop this. Maybe don't buy,"I bought several of this. Unfortunately i dropped 2 of them, about 3 feet above the floor, and the second hand stopped working on both of them."
3,Side fx automatic pencil,"I like the pencil but the thing is that they sent me the wrong color the picture was blue so I thought I was getting a blue pencil. What I got instead was a grey one. If i wanted grey i could have gone to a store where they sell it. I didn't think that store had blue ones. So that the only thing bad about this pencil/seller. But the function of the pencil is great I can't wait until school starts up again and then use it again. All and all it a good pencil but I rather have a blue one like the picture mentioned. Oh well I like the long eraser, I like the feel of the pencil in my hands."
4,Cheaper alternatives,"It worked great, but when I ran out I bought another cheaper brand and it was just as good. No complaints though."
2,doesn't do what i thought it would,This stuff is messy to apply. Worse than that when rains it drips of off the table and onto the seat cushions where it leaves brown yellow stains. I'm letting the teak go natural and not bothering with the oil. It looks better anyway.
5,Handy reference.,"The Sky atlas companion goes along perfectly with the Sky Atlas itself. Everyone of those obscure deep sky objects, like those open clusters not in the NGC, have little entries. If you have the Sky Atlas 2000 already, this book is a great supplement."
4,EAT YOUR WAY TO HEALTH,"This is a practical introductory guide on how to achieve and maintain optimum health by following a balanced and nutritious diet. It contains specific advice on how to deal with certain health problems like insomnia, stress, hyperactivity, depression, headaches and energy loss. The role of fresh foods, minerals and vitamins, complex carbohydrates, fats and sugars is discussed in detail The chapters include: What is Nutritional Healing?; History of Nutritional Healing; Essential Nutrients, and; Nutritional Therapy as Preventive Medicine. Appendix 1 list the benefits of herbs, the food sources of minerals, botanical vitamin sources and foods that enhance healing, while Appendix 2 provides a series of typical recommended daily menus. This helpful book concludes with a recommended reading list and an index."
3,"kids love it, but not particularly tasty","The container is very easy for kids to select their choice of sprinkles and ""shake away"". Because of that, they love it and go back for more...BUT when I tried the product myself, it was almost tasteless. The shapes are cut -- but they are more for adventure, not the cuisine."
4,Lots of decorating fun!,"I bought theses sprinkles to decorate the cupcakes for my son's 4th birthday. We had a lots of fun decorating as there were six different color/shapes mixes. In addition, the decoration was easy as we just covered the cupcake with frosting and then sprinkled it. We made 36 cupcakes and still had sprinkles left. As a previous review pointed out, some of the shapes were more prone to break than others. Yet, I found the number of broken figures to be small. As for taste, well it is just sugar..."
2,The songs of life CD.,"I was excited to purchase this particularly with some of the reviews I had read. I was not impressed as much as I thought I would be. The songs are related to life events which is a great selling point. However, I was not impressed with the quality of the singing. Alejandro Jaen is a great producer but as a vocalists, I don't see it happening."
1,You will be disappointed,"This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. The audio and video quality is below poor. Even as a B-skin movie it does not meet the mark. Honestly, I could not watch the whole movie even skimming through it. I threw away the movie but kept the DVD case so that my purchase would not be a total loss."
3,Bishop at Sea,Not one of his better ones--I thought it a bit far fetched. I guess I just don't thing Blackie could have done this one
2,sub par,I had alot of hopes for this book and came away disappointed. I'm a big Fr. Greeley fan and usually really enjoy his stuff especially his Blackie Ryan books but this work just didn't grab me. For starters it's well known that Fr. Greeley is a little Left leaning and he leaned a little too far this time for my liking. Second I thought the story line had alot of potential but he just didn't make it work this time around; too political not enough mystery. I think if this book were reworked it could be a fantastic read but I doubt that's gonna happen. I guess I know now why this title has droped out of circulation.
4,Irish Heaven,"Fr. Greeley sure can write a mean dectective story. This one is loaded with his trademark Irish, Chicago, Notre Dame and Catholic references. It moves quickly and keeps you guessing for just long enough. It is like a sip of the Cardinal's whiskey....smooth and full of Irish flavour."
5,HOME BOYS,"I LOVE THIS CD, AND I LOVE AL-C & DUCK. THEY ARE FROM MY HOME TOWN OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA, AND THEY ARE REPRESENTING OUR CITY TO THE FULLEST. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CD IS TIGHT, FROM THE CD COVER TO THE INTERLUDES. WE HERE IN THE GUMP(MONTGOMERY) ARE VERY PROUD OF THESE LOCAL BOYS DOING GOOD, AND HELPING TO PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP FOR RAP."
2,Not good enough,"I bought it as a present for my father. What I heard was that LED lights are very bright and efficient. But what a disappointment!!!! It's not as bright as I expected it to be. It uses 3 AA batteries and it's heavy. It has a rugged design, but what I need is, it to be very bright. We don't use the flash light as hammer, do we? After buying this I changed my opinion about LED flash lights. But when I saw a different type of LED flash light in Walmart, I became curious. Thought I'll try my luck a little more. Surprise..!!! It turned out to be very bright... so bright that when I tried first time, it was pointed to my face and I couldn't see anything for sometime. It has got just 3 LED bulbs (instead of 5 in hummer) and just one AA battery (instead of 3 in hummer). Now I'm thinking, why I bought the hummer instead of this one!!!!"
3,identity crisis,"This novel has nothing to do with segragation... its about a young boy who is unsure of his cultural identity. He is split between his western views and his Hawaiian beliefs. Throught the novel the young boy gathers more information on who he is as a Hawaiian and his place within the Hawaiian community. This novel is a great read for anyone who is familiar with Hawai'i and the problems many ""half-breeds"" have with identifing themselves."
5,Prairie River is a Gem.,"This is a wonderful, historic, fast-paced story. The story's action gets you from the beginning and doesn't stop. Great for kids of all ages. You won't be disappointed by this book and I love that it reads historically accurate from the characters thought, dress and circumstances. Loved it!"
4,Prairie River,"I usually don't read these kinds of books, but once I started this one, I couldn't put it down. It is written for juveniles and thus it moves at a fast pace and doesn't really have a lot of low points. Some parts are rather difficult to believe, but the intent is to show young readers how their faith can be exemplified through fictional characters.There are really no villains in this book. Some people don't like Nessa Clemens, but the author doesn't really develop an evil antiheroine. None of the situations Nessa finds herself in are life-threatening and things always seem to work out. as I said, it is a book about faith more than the historical setting it takes place in."
1,Miniture Book,I was dissatisfied with the product. I ordered a hard back book and recieved a minture paperback book.
3,H/P Accessory,"If you have an H/P camera that will fit this dock, it is a handy thing to have to be able to do more with your camera."
5,Using HP M-Series Dock with M307,The product was very well documented. The installation went very smoothly. It automatically recharges rechargeable Ni-MH Batteries that are in side the camera and also allows to upload any pictures that are saved in the camera to the PC or notebook. It is very useful accessory for the HP Camera [M307 in my case]. Highly recommended to all who use their HP Digital camera continuously. [...]
5,A GOOD Book!,"Crystal Broadcasting is a good book. It not only explains how to use crystals to remove blocks and barriers, there is a universal symbol that the author, Anne Brewer, received which can be used in many different scenarios.Crystals are usually used to enhance good. This book supplies a different kind of information. It teaches you how to amplify your ability to remove obstacles by using crystals. This is very valuable information. For barriers/walls can definitely keep you from reaching a goal/having a good life. It is smart to FIRST release the negative, then increase the positive. This book can help you do that. This book is not a reference book for a stone's innate abilities or vibrations."
3,Very Simple Book,"Was a little disappointed in this book. Just too simple, too basic and with much of the information available other places."
5,Yay!,I love this quick study guide! Lots of information and a wonderful refresher (I took 2 years of German in high school ten years ago.) Wonderful review.
5,Best thing around!,"I love this product for cleaning saddles and tack! Takes mold and dirt right off! Easy to use, has not ruined any type of leather as of today and great price....when you buy in bulk!"
5,Don't be misled by the title! But still excellent!,"I'm not sure how Collectables can come up with 23 track CD titled ""The Very Best of Jack Scott"" and leave off such smash hits as ""My True Love"", ""Leroy"" and ""The Way I Walk"". But they did. Fortunately I had these songs on another CD so it was no big deal. In any case, even with the majority of the tunes being chart ""misses"" instead of ""hits"", this is a very enjoyable compilation. Basically a nice mix of pop/country/rockabilly tunes which is further enhanced by Scott's great vocals."
5,The Unfashionable Human Body,This book is a monumental and very entertaining study of human fashion fetish. Bernard Rudofsky is the most important writer I have ever read on subjects like this and architecture and cultural habits we take for granted. Prodigious Builders is another of his titles worth having in one's memeory. He activated the interest in Vernacular Architecture.
4,"Hey, if you like fun pop...","I bought this album, listened to it, then payed no attention to it, dismissing it. I came back to it a couple weeks later and really started getting into it. The songs are really good and you can't go wrong with ""swans"", ""rough gem"", and ""volcanoes"". I was skeptical that this album wouldn't be what I loved from the unicorns, but in many ways it's even better. Buy it."
2,why,"why did they pull the ever annoying 'hidden track' nonsense at the end of the album. It has been done to death and is always, always, totally pointless. Gee, we get a song after 5 minutes of hiss, or rain, or silence? Wow, that is neat.Immediate downgrade for that. Overall, this is a let-down. Weak song-writing, bad production, songs that go on too long with no variation (see songs 1 and 2), and the completely pointless hidden track thing.The Unicorns they aint."
5,Great authors and GREAT stories!,I bought this book for Kurland and Moning's stories and was not disappointed. The other authors were new to me -- but very good. This is one of the best compilations out there. I thought each story would have made a great novel in itself.
3,A mixed batch,"Strangely enough, the top-billed story in this novella was the one I enjoyed the least! My favourites of the book were (in order): Karen Marie Moning's story about the man who forgot he was a man until his dream-lover showed him the way and Madeline Hunter's story about the half-dragon-half-man. I loved them both!The other two stories were not awful, they just lacked emotional punch and a little more erotica. However, the book is worth buying just for the two stories I mentioned above. Karen Marie Moning is establishing herself as a writer who can deliver fantasy, erotica and emotional punch equally well."
3,Sherrilyn Kenyon is a Star,"I bought this book because of Ms. Kenyon's Dragonswan. I loved it and it was worth the $9.99 all on it's own. For the most part all Ms. Kenyon's works should go on for thousands of pages as her characters are rich and the relationships strong. The other three stories were mediocre at best, especially ""Interrupted Tapestry"" which had no chemistry and odd time period . Over all worth the money if you stop after the third story."
3,teaser,I bought this book because I am a big keyon & moning fan! the stories they wrote in here were good but i was so bummed because they were soooo short.
3,taoestry,"I bought the book for a short story that is outragiously over priced. I liked the short stories, but in my opinion they got in the way of the origional series that I am reading. A good look at the other authers if you are looking for another class to read. I would suggest this book to anyone looking for an avenue of romance."
3,"Mostly Paranormal Historical Romance, Mostly Ok","The book begins with two stories by author's I had never heard of and both these stories aren't really that paranormal, especially the second that is simply a historical romance, the last two stories by Sherrily Kenyon and Karen Marie Moning both had similar elements of time travel and were much more pleasing, my favourite of the entries is Karen Marie Moning's, cause there's nothing like one of her highlander time travel books, yummy!!!"
3,Indifference,"I was happy to see this book included one of the novella's I had wanted to read, ""Into The Dreaming"" but otherwise I was left with a feeling of indifference"
2,A little disappointing,"The back of this book alludes to the ""romance and adventure"" of the middle ages. It's all romance; love-at-first-sight/I-want-your-nuts type romance. I mean, all together it's not a horrible read, but definitely not particularly satisfying either"
2,just don't understand,"maybe i am missing something, i believe this to be a bloated-book, could have been more concise. bought it based on other reviews."
5,A many splendid book,"At first, I related to this book lightly and let others that had a more flamboyant approach to the subject of Tai Chi and Qigong capture my interest. But then there came a moment when The Healing Promise of Qi took over to become a permanent feature of my reading life now for many months. With little mystery and great charm Roger Jahnke explains the Qigong way of solving some of the greatest mysteries of them all - how to joyfully unburden ourselves of emotional baggage and trauma and physical, mental and emotional disharmony in order to allow the wonders of life to express healing energy within us. All this he does admirably with little ego and much compassion. The insights in this book are many as so are its blessings. My heartfelt thanks to the writer for his truly wonderful gift."
5,0's and 1's rock!,"When you're in a position which requires you to wear a tie everyday, ties like this help a lot. The design is simple enough that it still looks professional unlike some cartoony ties out there.Also, when tied, this is long enough that people like me don't need to find some means of holding the short part in back in place. I highly recommend this to geeks like me."
3,"Swinging, baby!","""The Hand of Fear"", even though it was first broadcast in the early 70's, still fairly reeks with the swinging 60's style feel that the 3rd Doctor/Unit stories had. I blame it on Jo, the vaguely flowerchild companion.This novelization, another in the vast series written by Mr. Dicks, is more or less a photocopy of the script, but with slight better special effects (i.e., you get to use your imagination). The Doctor saves the day again, but the villianous Master gets away. Yeah, baby!"
4,getting better,"I wasn't sure how I felt about this series after reading the first volume, but in this volume it seems to be getting better. In this volume, Shizuma participates in a K-Fight with a teacher, and Ryoko and Tatsuya are in a play together. This volume gives readers a little more insight into Ryoko, although Tatsuya seems to become more mysterious. I'm still not sure how much more in going on in Shizuma's mind, other than his next fight, but I like him anyway. Daisaku, Ryoko's biggest fan, is around for a bit, being cute and more than a bit stalker-like. I'm still not sure if I would recommend this series, but at least is seems to be getting better. I'm looking forward to the next volume."
1,Dreadful Interface,"Whoever put this software together for Oxford sold them a bill of goods. In fact, this version is even worse than the previous one, especially since you can't scroll through the word list, but instead have to know what you're looking for. I've also turned up more than a couple actual errors (which are not in the paper version). Oxford should put together a useable version and offer it as a free upgrade to people who bought this one."
1,OUP will not help you with C-Dilla software,"I have to recommend that NO ONE buy this product until the OUP solves the C-Dilla license management problem. Like other reviewers I bought the product in good faith only to find that the C-dilla copy protection simply doesn't work. It fails to authenticate the disc and when you try and get help from the OUP they ignore you. I even wrote to the Managing Director, Ivon Asquith, who fobbed me off back to the technicians, who then did nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, you'll be wasting your money."
3,Oxford Dictionary in Waltz Time,"This ne edition is still a fine word book, of course, but the argument here is with the technology. Installation takes a long time, startup allows delay allows you to write a letter or two in Word complete with spelling errors before the dictionary program is usable. (There is a paranoic fear of pirating, I guess, that makes setting up and using the dictionary a bit silly.)Graphic component is prettier but not as straightforwardly clear and usable. Type more stylized and apparently smaller.When you tamper with the redesign of a classic book/newspaper/website, etcetera, you run the risk if fouling up. That happened here, and though I love the data I hate te package. The only reason I bought it was I was told by Oxford that my earlier edition, which was occasionally coming up garbage rather than English, was not meant to be run with XP. An obligatory upgrade, alas."
1,Warning! Minimum System Requirements!,"Before you buy the CD-ROM version you should be aware of the MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:I copied the following from the attractive box in which the CD-ROM is packaged:*PC with minimum 200 MHz Pentium-class processor *32 MB RAM (64 recommended) *750 MB hard disk space *16-speed CD-ROM drive (32-speed recommended) *Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0 *SVGA monitor: 800x600 pixels, 16 bit (64k, high color) setting recommendedOtherwise, you'll be sitting there with a 400 dollar useless piece of plastic like I am until I upgrade my system."
3,"I wouldn't buy it now, but I do like it.","Now that the OED has a website, my CD ROM version is definitely not worth 395 dollars. I am pleased with it and love looking up little known or archaic words. The only other criticism is that I would liked to have all the history, credits and forwards in the 20 volume version on the CD. I was dissapointed when I found I didn't get the whole dictionary. Words are nice, but I want all the other parts of the dictionary too. I do love how the CD is copy friendly. I like to take quotes from the dictionary for email and later reference.That was my major dissapointment with the National Geographic magazine on CD. Not being able to copy text makes NG on CD almost worthless, because the pages are hard to read on screen and not worth printing because they are still hard to read."

I've also turned up more than a couple actual errors (which are not in the paper version). Oxford should hire a new developer, create a useable version, and offer it as a free upgrade to people who bought this one."
3,Copy protection makes this too inconvenient to use,"For years I wanted to own this wonderful dictionary and when I had saved up my pennies, I jumped at the chance to order it.What's most striking about it is how often I DO NOT use it, rather than use it. The copy protection scheme is so awful that it takes 60 seconds for the software to come up on my 266 mhz thinkpad. Furthermore, because the CD costs so much, and because I can't back it up due to the copy proection, I fear to take it with me in my laptop bag in case of loss or damage. Hence I rarely use the dictionary unless I am at home, and instead use my simple hard-disk-resident American Heritage dictionary. Just today I saw the word ""putsch"" while I was reading something online. American Heritage gave a simple definition but I would have loved to look it up in the OED. Alas, I can't.So I wouldn't recommend this software until they get rid of the most horrible copy protection scheme I have ever seen."
1,OED CD 2.0 Misleds Purchasers: Fails to discuss issue,"When I purchased this CD, I was under the strong impression that I could load it on my hard drive. Oh, what a costly and irrecoverable mistake! In order to use this CD, one must leave it in the CD drive. So if one, as I, uses the CD drive for other purposes and then needs to look-up a word on the fly, one is required to first look-up the CD and then load the CD. Although the CD is nice, Oxford neglected to simultaneously use informed state of the art technology to prevent piracy and allow friendly, appropriate access to those of us who are OED lovers. At this writing, OED has slightly modified their website to note this ""feature,"" but it is still slightly less than buried. When I purchased it, there were no such hints. I would expect better behaviour from Oxford University Press. I have tried taking this issue to Oxford, and they won't reply. Their customer service is appalling. No one is in charge. What a shame."
3,"Software Probems,","I always make a back up copy of all my CDs and DVDs, then I use the backups and lone some one the back up I also put them on a external hard drive as a backup."
3,O.K.,"I ordered this practice pad along with the Chinese in a Flash Vol. 1 & 2. I thought this practice pad would offer more ideas, but it takes the characters in the exact order of Chinese in a Flash Vol. 1 only not all of them, just some. Had I known this I would not have bought the practice pad. If I was you I would get either this practice pad OR Chinese in a Flash Vol. 1 (personally I would get the Chinese in a Flash card, much more options, reusable & easy to carry size.)"
3,Nice introduction to Chinese Charcters but NOT a Calendar,"First of all this item is not a Calendar. While the pages are listed as ""Day 1, Day 2, ..."" and etc. there are no dates. However, it does have a good selection of words appropriate for the beginning Chinese student. However there is no indication of stroke orders, which is limits this product's use. In the end you're probably better off buying a real character book and doing the ""one a day"" on your own."
2,Cheap swithces,"When I first started buying these switches they were a much finer quality than the last ones (the ones I am reviewing now). The new switches, although they appear the same on the exterior, the click sound they emit when switching on/off is annoyingly cheap sounding and the feel of the switch when switching on/off also feels cheap. Maybe that is why the original place I was buying the switches stopped carrying them."
4,sleek,"I bought this because i didn't like the look of a basic toggle switch next to a large ""decor"" opening required for the switch next to it. gives a little bit of interest then a boring toggle look."
5,Dry Bag,Quite large in size. Have not actually used yet but appears to be a quality item. Should work well for my purposes.
5,Great British Comedy,"The actors are great. The stories are exaggerated, but, based on a trip to England one year, as I personally noticed, not too far off what happen with stores throughout Europe."
1,You will lose these pieces.,"The game pieces are very small and very light, and they are very difficult to handle on the game boards. Every part is made very cheaply. For example, Chinese Checkers uses a paperboard overlay for the grooves, and hollow plastic mini-balls for the ""marbles."" It takes a great deal of manual dexterity to set up a game, and the high likelihood of knocking pieces around inadvertantly makes gameplay frustrating. There are better made alternatives.Some of the pieces are so small that they are choke hazards for young ones and maybe pets."
2,Not a Christmas album,"I was looking forward to this album, but as with many Celtic Christmas albums I have purchased, this was a major diappointment. It didn't particularly have anything to do with Christmas. The album title and list of artists made me think that this would include traditional Christmas songs from the Irish and Scottish traditions. I would love to find such an album. This definitely was not it. On the other hand, unlike my other Christmas music, it is something I can play year-round as well as at Christmas time. I just would have liked to know that before I bought the album."
4,Good music for any time of year,"I read a postive recommendation of this in the paper so my wife got it for me for St. Nick's Day. It's very nice though as the online review mentions, there is very little in the music itself that refers to Christmas. In any case, the music is lovely and for anyone who likes the Celtic style."
4,Good Book!,"Just finished. Bringing The Light.. provides valuable info on rites. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in ""understanding"" African Centered Rites of Passage."
1,Better than No-Doz,"I can't believe I spent hard earned money on this mind-numbing drivel. The authors have little sense of continutity, endlessly engage in fringe-driven hyperbole, and generally have ignored the needs of the average, non-academic reader. I got more value out of the Pet Rock I bought back in the '70's."
2,"Cute and entertaining but not a ""workbook""","This book, booklet really, has 365 one liners and some very entertaining sayings. However if you are like me and are looking for a ""workbook"" type of guide then this is not the book. I'm going to keep looking"
2,Action one-liners for the bored with lots of time to spare,"This book has 365 one-liners which should boost your creativity, but I found most of the tips uninspiring and lacking any depth. Most of the tips are in the area of a)doing something different than usual; b)doing things you should have done a long time ago and c)doing something ludicrous. Without the inspiration (like giving me the reason why I should accomplish a certain task) I can't see myself buying time to do this."
2,Booklet,"This is a booklet with a lot of one liners. A much better book of questions is a book titled ""75 cage-rattling questions."
4,Read this book jointly with Whack a Mole Theory,"Read this small little book jointly with the author's other book entitled Whack-a-Mole Theory. The latter book, which has more depth, will put all the 365 ideas into a much broader and meaningful application perspective. Although this book contains mostly fun-filled one-liners, stretching over 365 days if you apply one per day, it's filled with excellent and yet practical stuff on paradigm-busting. Remember, adding fun, joy and play into your life - and business - will certainly give you more perspectives when looking at the same problem situation. The 365 ideas in this book will change - and reshape - your paradigms!"
5,strange very strange,"This is a great book to read, there are alot of strange things. And it is all true. I'm still reading it and already a family member is wanting to read it too. A great book about strange things in this world I would of never believed. Great price to mention too."
1,Urban legends find a home,"Typical of a Ripley's Beleive It Or Not book, there are norefrences. It is a collection of cute trivia from the olderRipley's Believe It Or Not books. Problem is, most of whatcan be checked, is wrong. Frank Wells was never on the Titanicnor the other ship disasters claimed. The section on lawsincludes myths and jokes that someone believed. Stories fromolder Ripley books are re-told with different names. It evensays ""Mushrooms are a fruit."" (They are actually fungi.)"
3,Teak Cleaner,"This product is easily applied. However, it may require multiple treatments to work. Also, application needs to be followed by a metal brush in order to make the darker areas brighten up. I was not terribly impressed, even for the teak table and chairs I was trying to clean - all were in good shape and outdoors for less than a year. Too much work is necessary if multiple cleanings per year are required. According to the write-up this should not be required."
5,Read this book was the foundation of my awaking!,"I read this book in 1992 as new postpartum doula, and childbirth educator.This book alone created the foundation for wanting to learn so much more about breastfeeding and infant feeding industry. It should be mandatory reading for every doula.One book facilitated so much change in thinking about the formula industry and the politics of breastfeeding!Thank You."
5,Quick delivery in condition described,This product was shipped to me within the time frame promised. It arrived in the condition described.
1,waste of money,"the game is very small and light, it does not lay flat on the table, so the pieces are unstable. I do sudoku every day during my commute, but I could not stand to look at this game for more than 10 min. I played once when I received it, than put everything back in the box and the box in a drawer, I can't even say where it is. To that extend it is very durable, unless you through it away it will last for ever, becasue you will never use it again."
5,For a Complete State-Space Perspective,"If you are an engineer with least span of attention, this book is certainly not for you. But if you are somebody who likes things to be concise and profound, and takes thrill in riding through theoretical maze, only to wonder in the end at it's simplicity and completeness, you would love this. I would say, second chapter on State-Space theory is the core of the book. Helps you to look at systems from different view-points, elaborating on different proprerties a system can and should have, meanwhile relating one with the other, filling the reader with sheer joy by giving him a complete picture.Huge list of references at the end of every chapter and a brief appendix on Matrix algebra adds further value to this ultimate book on Linear System Theory."
4,Linear Systems - State Space Equations,"The book is very nice, although the cover seems to be not so robust (too thin).But I'm satisfied with the product."
1,Exhausting,"This book is exhausting to read. A far better source to learn linear systems is _Linear System Theory and Design_ by Chi-Tsong Chen.There are numerous other books that cover certain topics in Kailth's book much better, too. Look at _Optimal Filtering_ by Anderson and Moore, _Linear Optimal Control Systems_ by Kwakernaak and Sivan, _Digital Control of Dynamical Systems_ by Franklin, Powell, and Workman, and even _Digital Control_ by Franklin and Powell."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this item. Eventhough it's a cute huggable toy I also bought it because my 18 month old loves the ""I Love You"" song.This only plays one line from the song even after you pull the battery protector card out. I thought that it would play the full song once it was out of demo mode but I was wrong. If you want a cuddly Barney for your child this one is good but don't expect it to play any of the full song despite the reviews."
4,Barney plush,"My son loves this plush; he lights up & sings, ""I love you"", & ""you're my best friend"". The only problem that I saw it the product was that his belly is hard."
4,Great for Individual Study,"I bought this book after moving to Korea to help learn the language. I found it a great resource and easy to use. I also thought that it helped me as a English teacher in Korea by teaching a lot of useful classroom dialogue, as well as work related things, like how to great spouses etc. I worked through this book on my own and found it was extremely possible to learn from and the excercises at the end of each chapter really emphasize you learning the Korean. I would say that if you are like me and finding yourself suddenly surrounded by Korean this book is a great way of demystifying it."
2,NOT for beginners...,"The practice CD is good for helping with pronunciation, but the rest of the ""Course"" is too poorly structured. I tried using the book to refresh what I learned two years ago. No joy. This thing jumped around too much. Become friends with a patient, native Korean and use the $$ to buy them coffee."
4,Good... Not the Best,"I have been self-studying Korean for several months because I have several Korean friends, and this is one of the books that I have tried using. Teach Yourself Korean uses to much romanization, even though it also teaches Hangul (''). I like the way that the book teaches Hangul, the writing system. It does not explain it as well as ""Learn Korean the Easy Way for Beginners,"" which one of my Korean friends bought me in Korea, and I have not been able to find in the United States. But it explains the sounds and shows words that use them well. The vocabulary is very specific the certain situations, but the situations are fairly common. It explains several grammar points per chapter, which are fairly useful, including different verb forms and particles that go after nouns.Overall, I like Teach Yourself Korean, but it will not do an amazing amount by itself without other knowledge of Korean probably."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a Audio program that I could listen to in the car while commuting to wrok each day. This program is design to be listened to at the same time your reading the book. Regardless, I listened to the CDs without the book and noticed that a lot of the words I wished to learn (basics) were not covered. I ended up buying a reference dictionary and another audio program."
4,The Impatient Gardener,I started using this book in mid summer and so far I have been amazed. I purchased a house that had nothing but weeds in the back yard. I hired someone to get rid of the weeds and all they did was kill what little grass there was. A friend gave me The Impatient Gardener and I started doing what it recommended and now I have a yard full of grass. My next door neighbor came over to find out what I had done to make the grass grow. I plan on giving her the book for Christmas.
5,I have the greenest grass in my subdivision!,"This is a super book that will give you common sense, easy step methods to the best looking lawn and landscape around. We moved into a new house that had no grass or landscaping when we moved in. Three weeks later, we had neighbors stopping by our house to find out what our secret was to starting and KEEPING grass growing in our difficult to grow clay front yard. This book contains basic fundamentals on pruning, manicuring, and how to's on picking the right grass and ingredients for your lawn."
4,Gardening for Dummys,This is a great book. Easy to understand and gives you enough confidence to get creative. Even the experienced gardner will find good solid facts and techniques.
3,Old eyes!,"To be truthful, I haven't started to read this because the print is so small. I gave a rating of 3 stars, which seemed kind of neutral."
3,Gorgeous bottle and fragrance,"I own the original Lolita Lampicka fragrance as well as this one, both in spray bottles. I love how they smell on me, but I must say the original fragrance has longer staying power than this scent. This one is light and smells ever so powdery on me at first, but then calms down into a delightful more flowery scent. It's great for summer. But again, the scent just seems to wither away into nothing the longer it stays on me. The bottle is a stunning piece of art that compliments my fragrance collection."
3,Strong perfume,"This is a beautifully bottled perfume and I liked the fragrance when I first sprayed it on me, but as time went on wearing it, the chemistry in my skin changed to the point that it became too strong for me.I love the bottle and will use it for show with a few other's on display."
3,smells good but a little to sweet.,I was super excited to receive my new perfume from lolita lempicka it was delivered today and I have to say it smells pretty good but a little bit to sweet. I would much rather return it but unfortunetly I cannot which kind of upsets me. So I guess im going to have to keep it and spray a tiny bit everytime I use it.
4,Good for Everyday Use,"I am happy about this purchase. I also have a bottle of L de Lolita Lempicka EDP Perfume which comes with stronger scent than this version, but you can still tell that these two perfume belong to the same series. I love both versions. I think this lighter one is perfect for daily use, since it doesn't smell too strong. I will use L de Lolita Lempicka EDP Spray for special activities."
3,Perfume,"The bottle arrived broken (it wasn't padded very well). After exchanging several emails and a few photos, the seller did refund my money plus shipping. I think if the interior box had been padded and protected better, the box wouldn't have gotten damaged and the bottle wouldn't have broken. Still, they politely refunded my money after they saw the photos. Thank you!"
2,nice enough but poor value,"This fragrance simply does not last, zero staying power. Almost exactly like the original Lolita, very beautiful, but you need a ton of it and it still does not last.Not worth the money."
1,this is not L de Lolita --> buyer beware,"I ordered this expecting the orange carton and blue bottle, but what was shipped to me was not the vanilla scented dream I know and love. It's a flowery disgusting scent and now I can't return it. I will not be recommending this purchase to anyone."
3,eh. not what i expected.,"A. the color of the bottle when received is not a brilliant blue as pictured. its a rather deep amber color.B. the keynote is NOT bitter orange. in fact there is hardly any citrus scent in my bottle. the Vanilla is extremely overpowering. Not subtle, like i feel vanilla should be. when first applied, the perfume is ridiculously strong, like burn nostrils within the first spray.but i'll have to admit it lasts and actually forms a pleasing smell, thus not a complete waste.albeit i was really looking for a whole different scent then what i received. i really wanted a more unique beachy feel from what the description was on both this website and on [...].regardless, if you like the strong vanilla smell. go for it. bc you'll actually find a perfume with a pleasing vanilla flavor that lasts. =)"
4,Great vanilla fragrance,"I smell vanilla all the way whenever I use this one. I absolutely hate the bottle though!! It was a little difficult to figure it out at first, plus it is also quite tacky looking with the horrific 'L' jewelry and the fish net on it. On another note though, I do adore this fragrance, it smells so good and lasts about 4 hours on me which is good, so yeah, I recommend L'de Lolita."
1,no customer service,"I bought 2 of these bottles of perfume as Christmas gifts. One of the bottles sprayer does not work. I found this out after giving the gift,didn't realize that I had to test it before hand.I sent an email to amazon and to the distibutor, but heard nothing from either party.Maybe this will not fall upon deaf ears, hopefully!!"
2,nice smelly stuff,Smells like your grandma has been hugging pigs lately. I guess I wana say it is a nice smelly liquid that will make your granny a very happy person specially cause the very nice designed bottle that looks like a princess jewel .
3,Room for improvement,"I think there should be more different position shown, instead of holding the same position for several minutes. After listening to the DVD once to follow the instructions, it isn't always useful to hear them again during a practice. An option with a background music instead of the instructions should be added, otherwise it is easy to loose interest in following the routine with the DVD."
1,nod off to sleep!,"much too wordy and this 'practice' is much more Hatha than i have ever experienced at studio practices! Way too slow on every single posture- which are much too passive to be in entire 37 minutes!!! I would be better off with a power nap! If i would have known the true content, i wouldn't have purchased since i can't return once opened! A total waste of my money!"
1,disappointed in this timer,This timer worked for 2 weeks only - I did read other people had problems with it but I loved the idea and so hoped it would work...live and learn...
3,Works great for my kids,The time tracker works great. I use it to let my kids know when it is okay to get up from the dinner table. The only problem is it is hard to figure out how to change the time even with using the manual.
2,not easy to use it,"It's a good idea but not easy in use. To start this timer you need to push like 10 buttons. It's more less ok if you need to use it for the same amount of time. But reprogram it - oh, no! You have to push another 100 buttons. Make sure you don't lose the manual to do that. I would use it a lot if it wouldn't be that complicated."
3,Ok but could be better for the price,"We bought this timer for our 3 year old's timeouts. It really does help him with timeout to see the lights flash to tell him when he's almost done.But, for the price, I would have expected this to be easier to use (to use the Auto timer you have to push three buttons to start on a pre-set time) or be more flexible in programming (you cannot change the order of the lights to go from red to green instead of green to red)."
1,DON'T buy this!,"I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries). It is such a great concept, but unfortunately is very poorly made. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life."
3,"Like it, but needs improvement","I use it for my 2 and 4 year old boys, for time-outs/naughty step and bed time. Needs improvement:*It has only one (1) program memory. One for automatic, and one formanual.*It is a hassle to set it every I use it, for the different timesneeded.Otherwise it isvery useful for my kids to have a concept of time, ie. how long until bedtime, how long for the naughty step, anything you can think of."
3,Versatile,"I use this color timer for counseling sessions. Many clients hate the buzz of a timer but with the light they know exactly how much time they have left without the annoying/rude/""get out of my office now"" sound. The colors are a great way to have this same effect in a much nicer way. I have even had clients point out our time is up when the color changed to red and I didn't notice right away. Almost everyone that has come in my office has commented that it would be a great tool for their kids (which the item was orginally intended for, but I don't have any yet). My only complaint is that the description is inaccurate (or the manual doesn't explain), but mine doesn't seem to have 6 different sounds or give me control over the brightness of the LED display. I would also like something a bit more professional looking and smaller but this was the only timer of the kind I could find."
3,Time Tracker,A bit cumbersome to set the time count. Otherwise a good product. The lights are not visible all the way around. Back side is not the same as the front.
2,not quite what i thought,"the idea is there... but the product does not match up; unless i am missing a step; each time the tracker changes a color, it says ""begin"" again; slighty annoying and confusing for the young ones; is should say begin only ""at the beginning"" and as it changes color either give a timed warning or say something else other than ""begin"""
2,Don't Lose the Instructions,We had very high expectations for this great tool. Awesome idea and our three year old thought it was really neat. I think we would have loved it if it wasn't so complicated to set and/or reset the programs (we're relatively bright people - rarely have a complaint about complexity). We lost the instructions after a few weeks and really haven't used it since.
5,Time Tracker A+,"I have a four year old foster brother who would never goto time-out. I saw the time tracker on a tv show and decided to try it. I let him pick out the sound effects for each color. Right off the bat he went to time-out the first time he was asked.I must warn you though the timer is not indestructible. The first time I had it next to him and he banged it on the ground knocking the batteries out. So, now we have it up high so he can see and hear it, but not break it."
3,Difficult to set,"I love the idea of this for my 4 and 5 yr olds but it is difficult to set. I think they are trying to give you lots of options but i wish there was just a ""quick start"" where you can easily set it for 30mins or whatever like a normal timer and it just counted down and added in the color notices for the kids. We dont use it even a fraction that. Tought we would as i think it is too complicated for my nanny to figure out and i dont want to take the time to set it for only 10 or 15ins"
3,"Great discipline tool, but difficult to use","Great product! Love it!To program the timer is not user-friendly.When I first set it up for 1 hour timer, it works beautifully. Whenever I need to set it a x-minutes timer for ""xyz"" reason, I would need to go through cruel process to get it done at moment's notice. I would be losing the original settings.To use buttons is quite tricky, there's no way for me to go ""back"" to previous step. After I missed the step, I would need to redo entire cycle.This product is great for discipline your children (or help you to keep time for you), but it merits an upgrade. IMO."
5,Love it!!,"My three year old takes a ""rest"" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity. He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over. In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up. It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up. He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more ""is it time yet?"". I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!!"
2,"Good Idea--WAY too hard to set, and too expensive","I like the idea behind this timer, and thought it would be very helpful in getting kids off to school on time. So I took the plunge and spent almost 30$ on it. We no longer use it, though, because setting it requires pushing various buttons or cominations of buttons (literally) 25-30 times to make the thing time a 20 minute interval.If you buy it, don't lose the manual! (also--don't spring for the adapter. Take one from some other toy or from your old baby moniter like I did. It works fine.)"
1,Never Worked,"Bought this to use in my preschool class, but it never worked. It lights up and the clock works properly, but you cannot change the settings for the timer."
1,Not Good,"Battery cover broke. Not exactly easy to follow the instructions. Overall not impressed with the product, I would not recommend it."
2,TimeTracker Review,This product was much smaller than I anticipated and the directions were over complicated. I would suggest buying a simple minute timer instead.
2,don't buy,"disappointing, too complicated. takes to long to set, lose time tinkering. glad i bought with a gift certificate or I'd have done the footwork to return."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Quality",We were really excited to receive this as a gift and could not wait to start using it. It worked wonderfully for a few weeks before it got knocked over (from about a three foot table onto carpet) and it broke. We were so disappointed! An item made for children really should be able to handle at least a few bumps or falls.
2,Good while it worked,"After about our third set of batteries, the whole display is lit up and no buttons work. I called the manufacturer and they said to return it through Amazon, but that is only for 30 days. It lasted us about 3-4 months. We loved the functionality and it stopped our daughter from constantly asking us when her time would be up. We did burn through the batteries with the lights constantly on while using it."
4,Great visual timer for speeches!,"I bought this timer to use while I practice speeches. So far, it is exactly what I needed. My speech for Toastmasters, for example, is 5 - 7 minutes long. I programmed it manually for 7 minutes total: 5 minutes for Green, 1 minute for Yellow and 1 minute for Red.I don't really understand the problem that others have had in programming the timer. The directions were very clear and simple. You can add the sound to what ever section you want. I may bring it to use at my club because one of our members is blind. The audible cue would be less distracting than one of us saying, ""5 minutes"" or ""6 minutes."" Great timing tool!"
3,What a pain to use!,"I agree with others who said this is a great idea, but not user friendly. I read the reviews and thought it couldn't be too much of a hassle, but I was wrong. It has ended up collecting dust because setting the timer is such a pain."
1,Big disappointment,"Learning Resources LER6900 Time Tracker Programmable Electronic TimerProduct arrived and barely worked, we were able to use it once and then it stopped working. After 3 battery changes we have given up. Looks great and would be great if it worked. Not worth the postage from Australia to return it!"
4,Just What We Wanted,This product does everything we wanted it to. The sound feature is great for my three-year-old. My only complaint is that it takes a lot of button pushing to get the timer set when you need a different interval of time.
4,Time tracker review,"The timer is awesome. I would only change 2 things: 1) I would not have it ask about wether or not I want the lights effects every time I set a time. I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't want the lights feature. 2) I would like to be able to set multiple time frames and select from them more quickly. As it is right now, each time I want a different time frame set, I have to answer 10 questions to set it up. When using this during therapy with my daughter, timing IS everything:)"
2,"Cool idea, does not work so well","Our two boys were very excited about this timer.I wanted to use it for time-outs and the kids wanted it for homework, music lessons, etc.When it works, it talks and gives warnings that time is almost up, it is pretty neat.The overall idea is really great, but the timer was too difficult to operate.We had tried repeatedly for 2 weeks to learn how to program it. Finally when one of my son's time outs was over before I could even get the doggone thing programmed, I decided that I could not keep it and sent it back. :-("
3,Worked for 6 months...bummer,"I'm pretty bummed about this timer. It was very useful, easy to program and had lots of options. But after 6 months it died so I went to change the batteries and the whole thing is fried. I even changed the small watch batteries that it needs as well. Nothing but a darkened screen. I used it maybe 2 times a week for 6 months and it was not handled by children. This was not worth $25 for 6 months of use. I assumed this would last through the toddler/preschool years but I was wrong. I would not buy it again and risk this happening. Again, it's a great concept but does not last long."
2,"As a time out timer, not impressive","I purchased this item to use for time outs. It looks like a great idea. It takes 20 minutes of reading instructions before you can start it, then every time you want to use it, you have to push three buttons! When you're dealing with a stubborn 2 year old, who has had to be put in time out dozens of times, pushing 3 buttons every time is a real pain!To me the first color should be red, and the last color green, meaning time out over. Go now. It's the opposite!I am debating just returning it now!"
2,"Good concept, but too complicated.","We bought this as a Christmas gift for our son, who is 7. He loves timers, and traffic lights (odd as that sounds) so this seemed right up his alley. Here's the problem: it takes at least 20 non-intuitive button clicks just to *set* the timer. I counted. And then another 5 non-intuitive clicks to *start* the timer. They've made it way too difficult, and we just don't use it. The flexibility to adjust the lights & sounds is a nice touch, but they force you through that every time. Ugh. I suppose this product is good for a repetitive task, if you never need to adjust the time period."
2,Learning Resources LER6900 Time Tracker Programmable Electronic Timer,I was excited to order one after seeing it on Nanny 911. The first one never even came on to work so I ordered a replacement.The replacement worked the first two times - after that it would program but then always shut down when activated. I sent it back and opted for a different one all together.
1,Such potential! Such disappointment.,"We had high hopes for this product but as another reviewer has said, its engineering is HORRIBLE. I would only recommend this product if you always want to use the same time span. I say this because you can set a default time which is relatively easy to reuse.The idea of 80% green, 15% yellow, and 5% red is great, but if you're hoping to enter 1-5-0-0-start and get a 15-minute 80/15/5 countdown, forget it. Every time I want to use the thing I have to go track down and re-read the documentation. Because of the difficulty in using it, we only use it for long tasks.As I'm trying to figure out how to use it each time, I do so with gladness that there is no one timing me as I set the timer. :-/"
1,"Great idea, horrible engineering, don't waste your money.","Time management is an important skill to learn, both as an adult and a child. I bought Time Tracker to provide a visual and audible basis for my three kids to learn time management. Piano practicing, computer game time, and to control how much time my teen is on the phone. This seemed like a great product concept to help us with our parenting. The lights and sounds worked as described, but no normal human being is going to be able to figure out how to program it. AND, once you have set and started the clock, there is NO WAY to stop it or reset it!!! You have to wait the full 30 or 60 minutes to start over!! We got tired of taking the batteries out to reset it every time we needed to adjust the time or start over. This product drove my family nuts."
4,"Helps time management, needs some updates","I bought this for my very creative, right-brained daughter who has little concept or concern for time. She hates to clean and pick up anything, but the TimeTracker has thrilled her. She can tell that when it's green she has 'plenty' of time, but when it's yellow she had better HURRY.The drawback is the awkwardness of the settings-it takes awhile to get used to how to set it, but once learned, it's easy enough. Hopefully they'll continue to work to make it more similar to push button timers for programming. Also, when it arrives by mail, it may need to be reset. I had to call the company, and was told to insert a paperclip into a tiny hole above the AC adapter spot to reset it. Until I did that, it would not turn on, despite new batteries- caused by something in the scanning process of the mailing equipment."
5,First one was a dud; second one works great so far.....,"The first one I bought didn't work straight out of the box. I returned it and bought another one, hoping it would work and that I just got a dud the first time. It worked as soon as I got batteries in it and has been used daily for about a week now. It's really nice for my daughter who needs help with her transitioning skills. I use it for meal times, computer time, clean up time and bed time. I'm very pleased with it."
2,piece of junk,"Well, I was looking for something to let me two-year-old know when he could get out of bed in the morning. The Time Tracker is a great idea but poorly designed! First of all, like others before me have said, it's a hassle to program and it only holds one time setting. So you to reprogram it if you plan to use it more than once a day. Then, the biggest frustration is that it locked up on me after two days of use. My poor son waiting patiently for the light to turn red and it never did. A good idea! Poor design! Low quality! Overpriced!"
4,Time Tracker,"The time tracker is good, once you know how to program it. You can program a standard setting, say you always give the child 15 minutes to play, you can set 12 minutes green and three minutes yellow and then red. You can have sounds between each segment or slience.If you change times frequently, you will either be frustrated by having to set it every time, or will become really good at doing it without the instructions."
4,So far so good!,"I had been looking at this timer for awhile, but because of the mixed reviews I wasn't sure!! However, we are very happy with it. Took me a few tries to figure out HOW to set the time/lights (and my kids 9 & 7 actually figured it out first!) It is a great visual timer and they get excited to set it (not so excited when thime is up- but follow the rules still) I would recommend to anyone!"
1,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","In spite of the reviews saying how difficult it is to program the timer, I bought one. The lights on the timer are great, but programming is impossible without the directions. You would think that once it's programmed you would just push a button to start it. No, that would be too simple. The first thing it goes to when programming it is the clock set! Really? I wanted a timer, not a clock. And once the clock is set, I don't want to have to tab over setting it every time I want to use the timer! Starting the timer takes pushing several buttons. I forget exactly how many because I misplaced the directions and had to throw the timer away. Please somebody re-invent this product! In the mean time, I found a kid friendly timer app on my iphone."
3,Thought this would help with my chronic lateness,"Even though I got this for myself and not for a child I think my review is still valid because I was using it the same way you would for a child anyway- to time activities. I have a problem with chronic lateness- always seem to leave the house later than I should and seem to have a poor sense of how much time I need to get ready for different events. I thought this would help me overcome it since it goes green, then yellow to let you know the ""alarm time"" is coming... then finally red to let you know your time is up. Unfortunately it's not too easy to set the alarm times. It's good if you or your child has to leave the house every day at the same time, because you only have to set it once and that's it- but if you have to keep changing the alarm times it gets too cumbersome real fast."
1,If only it WORKED,"I had high hopes for this item to help my son keep track of his time while doing his homework. I have ordered and returned this item twice. The first one arrived with one of the battery contacts missing. The second one arrived and I tested it once with no problems. A few minutes later, I tested it again and the sound didn't work. I reset it and tested it several more times with no luck. It never made a sound again. I returned the second one and will not be ordering a third."
2,Wish it lasted longer,"Well, we loved it while it was working. Then BAM, it was dead. Even after a change of both batteries (there are button batteries under the AAs). It really was helpful when it worked. But, for the price of it, I should've gotten at least a year of life out of it. Shoddy electronics. Great concept."
2,Not Worth it..............,"I teach elementary kids and I thought this timer would work great during my reading groups. Unfortunately, it did not. It lost its programming on a daily basis. It is also difficult to set and takes too long to get to the simple timer mode.I returned the item. It is much easier to use the timer on my watch. (Others who have it also say they have to reset the unit every day. I don't have time for that.)"
1,terrible product,I have ordered 2. Had to return one. Instructions were missing in one so product had been opened already. It didn't work. THey sent me another one and it doesn't work at all. The other works every once in awhile. I wouldn't waste your money. Spent a lot of money on items that don't work! VERY FRUSTRATED!
4,Great product!!!!!,"THis timer is an excellent tool for guiding kids to accomplish tasks. It's not so difficult to use, just read the instructions and you will be set rather quickly. Overall it is a great product."
3,annoying timer,"The timer is a great idea. My son (aspergers) responds very well to the visual cues which reinforce the verbal cues that the time provides. The problem is that is it not straight forward to program. You can't just set it quickly to give ""three minute timeout"", etc. You have to set up a program, which is somewhat time consuming, then run it and once it is running you can't change it, add time, stop it, etc. It allows you to create only two preset programs, but other than that it has no flexibility. Because of its limited functionality, it usually just sits on the shelf unused.Very frustrating since the concept works so well."
4,cut mealtime with 4 yearold,"It worked immrdiately cutting our hour long stuggle at dinner to 30 minutes without nagging.child wants to beat that timer even though she can't really see how much time is left. Love the motivating sounds when color changes, two customized settings- wish there were more."
4,light timer,This light seemed to work well for the church spokesman's club. Speaches had to be timed if various sections and worked well.
4,Great timer!,I bought it as my children were taking ages to finish their dinner. It has worked very well and the children are definitely eating more quickly!Worth buying.
1,Not for timeouts with multiple children.,I bought this to help with time outs. Since I have more then one child (four) I have different times for each time out. Completely useless for what I need it for. The manual timer takes for ever to program and is incredibly complicated. Not good for when you are trying to stay as calm as possible. I never use it so it was a total waste of money.
3,Good article,"This is a well written piece that informs the reader of European habits of avid campers. However, it doesn't inform about the company that actually markets these beauties here in the US, more specifically in the Pacific Northwest! [...] is an innovative company of which I am partner, that not only is a dealer and fan of roof top tents, but offers alternatives to the heavy tent trailers to be pulled by subarus, elements, any car that has a 1000 lb towing capacity as well. Check us out if this type of 'simple' camping appeals to you! [...]"
2,Not Pell's Best,"First of all, I bought this disc after buying two other discs by the Dave Pell Octet (I Had the Craziest Dream and Jazz Goes Dancing/Campus Hop). Those two are superb featuring some of the best west coast jazz of the 50's - I highly recommed them. My expectation for this disc was more of the same since it has essentially the same personnel (Pell, Fagerquist, Previn et. al.) but it was no where near as good. The arrangements just aren't as interesting and in fact there's really only 1 or 2 swinging tunes in the whole set. The rest plod along like a funeral march. Maybe because it was earlier, I'm not sure but the charts are very anemic and lack any kind of oomph! The second disc in this two-fer, the Katz LP reissue - is OK and features some nice stuff but not enough to make me want to play it again and again. It also suffers from some lifeless arranging which is a shame given that Jimmy Raney plays on a few of the tunes and he's such a hard swinging guitarist. Keep looking!"
