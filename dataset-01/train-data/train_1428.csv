5,Great book,"What I liked most about this book is that I felt like you could read one chapter, work on some things then read the next. I don't have time to sit down & read a whole book but a chapter or 2 per week works for me.It really makes a lot of sense that your children have so many different emotions but don't know how to express them. I read this at the same time as siblings without rivalry and they really complemented each other."
3,Fun for kids,"My 2 yr old daughter loves this because of the music and the lights. However, I think the mirror looks like a funhouse mirror, and my little tikes logo sticker was placed upside down already on the base of the vanity...that looks REAL nice! I am not 100% pleased for the $ I spent on it, but toys r us was no help in the store and I didnt have all day to search for the actual vanity i was looking for at the time. I love shopping online at amazon... the store we went to has terrible customer service."
5,Singing Princess,"My boyfriend and I purchased the super star sing along vanity for his daughter for christmas this year. She is four years old and she LOVES to sing and she wanted a vanity for christmas and when I saw this vanity I thought it would be great. Its a two for one deal. The radio works well and is very clear, just as well as the microphone. My boyfriend had a little hard time putting the screws in becasue there was no pre-cut holes but other than that it turned out great. The product is very sturdy and a great size. Some vanities I looked at looked too small and not sturdy at all. I am very pleased with the product. We will see how his daughter likes it on christmas. Overall I give this product 5 stars."
4,She loves it!,My 6 yo granddaughter loved her new vanity... and it was perfect for her because she wants to be a star!
4,Who mastered this?,"Hey this is a good recording of a really tight band. Gravity and Naveed are just excellent songs and excellent performances.The mastering really lets this down. It's so crushed to all hell that dynamic peaks are all but lost. Similar to the latest Metallica album - Death magnetic. It hurts your ears after 10 mins of listening!When will the horrible ""Brickwall"" mastering trend end. I'd give it another star on the review if it had been mastered less loudly."
2,What was the soundboard operator doing?,"I'm a huge Our Lady Peace fan and have seen them in concert twice and both times they were great, but this album lacked big time. I mean, the quality I got off of my 20 dollar GE recorder was better. The album mixer tried to juice up Raine's vocals and ruined what makes their live shows great and thats the energy. Our Time is Fading is a great addition, but I can't help to think what went wrong, is the new guitarist bad at performing live shows or is the source just that aweful."
5,A Must Have,"For those of you who are like me, OLP doesn't get around to your part of the woods very often. I have been a fan of OLP for so long that I have lost track of how many years, but no matter what, I still fnd out what the latest album is and buy it. This is no exception! If you call yourself an OLP fan you must have this in your collection! Raine is in rare form. I have seen them live a few times but have never heard his voice quiet like this and I love it! If there is one album that you buy this year it should be this one!"
3,"alright for casual fans, not enough for long time OLP listeners","this live cd was alright but didn't meet my expectations, production value was decent, could've been better with a broader selection of tracks. OLP has enough good material to merit a double disk live collection, something that would demand a lot of replay. Many of the performances on this record didn't really reflect the true value of their live act. There is enough singles for casual fans, most people remeber the recent and older hits from the nineties, but for the long time listeners the album just lacks something important."
4,If only I could actually read it...,"Fantastic diagrams and beautiful pictures, unfortunally it's entirely in Japanese but was still worth purchasing if you're interested in Sashiko."
3,"Meli'sa is great, but this album lacks hits","Meli'sa is surely a great singer, but this album misses strong material. It's ok for Meli'sa fans and it's always good to have more output by her, but her other albums are far better."
4,"A good book, quick read.",This book is good for a quick read and some daily strategies that can improve your personal and professional life.
2,very basic,I purchased this DVD because is was titled beyond basics This DVD should be called pre basics not beyond basics. gee's!
1,Beyond Basics?,"If you have trouble remembering that the guitar should be held with the sound hole facing forward, or don't really understand what a flat pick is-- well this is the DVD for you.There is nothing but nothing here. Tuning the guitar, a reminder that there is a difference between an acoustic and an electric, a review of flat picks and how some are thick and some are thin.Ever know one of those annoying guitar ""teachers"" who shows you how to strum up and down and then lauches into his own special lick- which he then never shows you how to play? This is one of those guys.half an hour and $17 dollars later- it's a total and complete waste of time."
2,worst one yet?,"Marty Stuart's last record, ""The Pilgrim"", was the best one he's created...this one may be the worst. There are a couple of solid songs on it...""Sundown in Nashville"", the duet with Merle Haggard and ""A Satisfied Mind"". Everything is just plain old bad. Marty Stuart has really written some solid country songs in the past (This One's Gonna Hurt You), but the songwriting for this one was terrible for the most part. If he had a concert in town tomorrow night, I'd go see him because he is always entertaining...but it doesn't change the fact that this collection of songs is bad, bad, bad. If Marty's songwriting well has gone dry, he'd be better off making an album of covers of old country standards."
3,"It's not the greatest album, but it's still good.","After all of the hype about the CD, I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more out of it. It has a lot of rock-a-billy, which he is famous for, but quite a few of the tunes are lacking (specifically Fool for Love). But there are a few good tunes. By George is a light-hearted song, along with Tip Your Hat and Too Much Month. Luckily the price is unbelieveably low at all locations, so even if you don't like it, there won't be a huge financial loss."
2,"Not very ""country""","While there is SOME ""real"" country on this, the little that is on, seems to be plagiarized. For example, ""Farmer's Blues"" is a good song. It is VERY country....but, take note! When I first heard this, I thought the tune sounded a LOT like the old Hank Williams, Sr. song, ""I Heard That Lonesome Whistle Blow""...and it didn't stop there. A line was lifted right out of the Hank,Sr. song, too, about him hanging his head and crying, ""when the evening train goes by""--and it's at the same place in the tune as Hank's line . I'm sure the song was on the subconscious mind of Marty and Connie when they wrote this, so, I wouldn't call this ""original""."
2,Misleading Picture,"The material inside of the book is great. The art is beautiful and the story is definitely worth reading. The only complaint that I have is that the picture shown with the product displaying all four issues and that was what I expected. This is actually only for the first issue. When you take into account that it also doesn't list this as issue/book 1, I'd say it's a pretty poor product description. The price was good, but not ""too good to be true"" for a series that ultimately doesn't have the popularity of most, so I wouldn't say that there were an common sense red flags with this."
4,Good product.,"I received this buttel in time , mostly I use it over my food (fava beens) or any beens you like it. test good . The only problem is you have to squeeze the bottle hard to get some of the oil."
3,it is great but...,"The flax seeds or ""lignon"" I suspect are the things that come out with the oil. They tend to get stuck. And at the end there is like 25% of it stuck in the bottle. It didn't always get puched out with the oil no matter how hard I shook it, even pounded on the thing."
1,HATED IT!,Everytime I took a drink I would get really sick and throw up. I mean if you ever wanted to feel what death was like take this. At first i thought maybe I was forgetting to eat with it...but then I ate big meals with it AND STILL I WOULD GET REALLY SICK AND THROW UP FOR LIKE 1 HOUR.
1,Flax oil,This product is so thick it is impossible to get it all from the bottle even though it was shook hard each time it was used. I had to discard the last of the bottle because I could not get anything more out.
2,Tastes Awful,"I don't know the best way to take this, but I tried it straight and mixing it into food and it tasted awful both ways and I ended up throwing it away. I recommend using ground flax and sprinkling it on food instead of this."
1,cheap & nasty,"This product just lacked in quality. Plus, the disc was temperamental, it would get stuck, stop and start at regular intervals."
5,Great seller,Takes 22 hours to charge. Works great need when we loose our electric to plug stuff into generator. Thanks again
5,Good lighting fixture,I use it for under the cabinet in my kitchen so I don't have to turn on the regular bright kitchen light. I think it's great for what I need.
3,a fixture that still uses the old-style bulb,"A vast majority of fluorescent fixtures sold at home improvement stores today use the newer T series bulbs. They are smaller in diameter, and they claim to be more energy efficient. This fixture uses the old standard F15T8, a 15 watt 18 inch bulb. I have both types of fixtures, and have noticed no energy savings from the slim bulb. What I have noticed is that in real life they burn out faster, and are harder to install. This fixture works well, but is entirely made of plastic. GE used to make these fixtures in metal, which I would prefer."
1,Cheap but convenient,"We had this light in our kitchen because it's poorly under our sink. Our other one is old and finally quit working. We bought one from Amazon and the first one that came didn't work. They took it back with no issues and sent us a replacement. We've now had the replacement for about 3 months and it just quit working. It's not the light bulbs, we've bought and tried several. This is the second one in 3 months that hasn't worked. Our old one lasted over 4 years."
1,Electronics died before 2 months - do NOT recommend buying,"Electronics died before 2 months. It looked good and was working and then all of a sudden nothing at all. I replaced the bulb hoping that was the problem,plugged into another electric outlet.No.. the electronics had died. I do not recommend buying. Complete waste of money and time."
2,Bad merchandise.,"The GE 16466 18-inch 15-Watt Basic Fluorescent Light Fixture, White was made of plastic and broke as my husband was installing it! It was not durable and I sent it back."
5,Best Game for the Sony Playstation,The graphics are amazing in this game. If you want to join the army and go to war this is the game for you. I played this game for hours and I still love it. This game offers you hours of enjoyment. You could use mortars and rocket launchers in this game. This game is a must have if you are a true strategy and action fan. This is the best Army Men ever. It shows 3DO put a lot of effort into this one.
3,This game is ok...,"The graphics are kinda choppy the game play is ok and the storyline is pretty weak. The weapons are about the coolest part, and only having a two player multiplayer makes it lose a lot.Rent first."
3,Decent value for the money,"The advertised reccomended age is 4+ and I bought this for my music loving four-year-old. Decent value for the money but two complaints:1.)songs have to organized into six set-lists - but what is annoying is that a set list must first be chosen on the player before the songs on that list can be heard. Adds a pointless complication - why not just a ""shuffle"" feature?2.) the first time I plugged the headphones into the player, I noticed one side was ""dead"". Granted this always happens to headphones and they're cheap to replace but you'd think they would arrive in good working condition.Overall, a decent value for a beginner MP3 player. The software is easy to use (one misleading thing: the player actually plays files in ""wave"" format: MP3 files must be converted. Not a problem but it takes a little time). Best feature is the volume control which is password-protected so you don't have to worry the music might get too loud for young ears."
1,Don't waste your money,This is a piece of junk. We had to buy another usb cable because the one it came with was defective. It DOES NOT hold 120 minutes of music. The firmware upgrade DOES NOT work.
4,Good Product,"I bought this for my 5 year old son and he loves it! It is a great product for kids. I love the volume control feature. Kids this age need volume control. That is the best ""feature"" of this product. The software was easy to load and is user friendly. No problem with downloading songs or converting the music to the proper format for the player. I understand there not being an AC adapter because it's designed for kids so no electrical plugs. However, there should be a way to charge it like an iPod instead of buying all of those batteries. Overall 4 stars."
5,"Reasoned giving, creativity, and a systems approach","Mr. Egger disputes the convention wisdom about why people should make charitable gifts and how those gifts should be used by the recipient organizations. As an attorney who represents non-profit boards and individuals contemplating major charitable donations, I have given Robert Egger's book ""Begging for Change"" to both groups of clients. The universal response has been extremely positive. Mr. Egger not only encourages donors to think through the goals and directions of their largesse but also challenges non-profit executives to use their creativity and a systems approach to improve the delivery and multiplier effect of their charitable services. Too often donors just write a check to feel good and non-profit executives do the ""same old, same old"" with no effect. Random acts of kindness are good, but reasoned giving coupled with creativity and a systems approach are better."
1,"More Aptly Titled: ""Begging for Attention""","I bought this book because I thought that it could be helpful to my nonprofit group in raising funds and awareness. It wasn't. I read somewhere that this writer has revolutionary ideas. He doesn't. They are more like revolving ideas. They go in endless circles and painfully monotonous spirals. They do not not move forward at all. If this author's is the lauded example of nonprofit leadership and innovation in the 21st Century, then the nonprofit community is doomed. I wish I had read some of the more honest reviews on Amazon before wasting my time and money. One reviewer was right in saying it is egomaniacal. The title of this book could more aptly be ""Begging for Attention."""
1,The Big Yawn,Clever at times but will not set the philanthropy field afire. A few (too many?) cute anecdotes but little substance and barely any quality research. Seems to be more about self-promotion than self-less acts. Remember when carob was going to replace chocolate as a healthy and nutritious treat? Remember that carob never quite hit the spot? Remember how carob always left a slightly bad aftertaste in your mouth? This book has the same unimpressive effect.
5,"Fast, furious and funny","This first novel gets off to a zippy start and never lets up for a moment; with devious twists and turns, a cast of great (often mercurial, sometimes downright psycho) characters, and a whole lot of detail about the drug scene in England (which may or may not be accurate but certainly comes across with authenticity). Most North Americans, however, will find it difficult to comprehend, as Cockney rhyming slang and slang in general comprise so much of the book. That said, within its own context, there's an almost musical perfection to the cadence of the writing--especially the dialogue. The editing, however, leaves a great deal to be desired. There are far too many errors in maintaining spelling consistency and in simple grammar. But once into Layer Cake, it's one of those books that's all but impossible to put down. Most highly recommended."
3,Would have been a nice little war if not for the dead,"Exocets ... symbol of success in technological advancement inmodern warfare ... and an utter failure in human factor. Thesemissiles were the only wild card the Argentitians had to throwin the face of the British, and they were running short.Hence, when the British Intel received a tip-off of Argentitianstrying to purchase Exocets in France, they activated their bestwoman, Gabrielle Legrand, on the case to counter the Argenticianace pilot Montera who was despatched to verify the missiles.Against the background of the intrigue, the Soviets were playingtheir own game, awaiting to score a coup of their own and leave eggs on everyone elses' faces."
2,Informative but not awfully helpful.,"This video is more about describing the brutality of an edged weapon then it is for explaining how to fight with one. If you want a video that's mostly demonstration, theories, and a discussion in knife tactics, then this is for you. However if you want a hands-on course on how to defend yourself with an edged weapon with technique drills and all, you best look elsewhere. Buy some Philipino knife-fighting videos instead."
3,cute family movie,"Always nice to see Valerie, I have a love crush on her always, all in all a great family movie!"
2,If you pay more than $40 - you'll be disappointed!,"I love Digital Blue's Disney photo editing software. That alone is worth the $20-$40 you'll pay for this type of camera but I wouldn't pay more than that! I have the Disney Pix Max (with flash) and the pictures are extremely grainy. The flash is like an old 35mm flash ~ very bright! TOO bright. Great for taking pictures at least 6 feet away but any closer than that and your picture will come out almost white.The Disney Pix software that comes with these cameras is so much fun, though! I've attached an example photo in the product description."
1,Bad screen,You get what you pay for...you can barely tell what the picture looks like on the digital screen after you take it.
1,The sceen on the back is the size of your thumb nail,"Please don't buy this camera! No child will be able to figure it out! It also seems to drain batterys quickly. I was very frusterated because I unsually read alot of reviews before I buy. I didn't!!! After being mad at myself I read some reviews and relized my mistake. Thanks to Amazon that they print reviews so we came make educate choices! This camera was Disney and so cute I thought it was a win, win. WRONG!!! I will buy a waterproof adult camera so it's tough for my child and not worry about it! Argh, so close to Christmas, hope I get the new one in time!"
3,Not bad for a $10 kid's toy,"I was able to get this at $10 and i must say it's worth the price i paid for.. the camera is so cute and it's really designed for kids! I've read a lot of bad reviews for this product but still gave it a try and bought 1 first. The camera's flash is too bright if you would take pictures of a very close subject so i would suggest not taking too close-up pictures with flash. Next, you might think that the pictures are too dark that you can hardly see it on the display but if you transfer it to your computer you would notice that the pictures are not that bad like how it's previewed on the camera. To think this is just a kid's toy so do not expect that the LCD is like one of those Sony/Canon's.. it's a very tiny display. The memory is big enough to store 200 photos.Yes the pictures are not that great but for $10? I wouldn't mind paying that much for this cute camera. I bought 2 more as gift for my god daughters!"
2,1903 copyright,"This is a reprint of a textbook from 1903, including original font. Great for history buffs, but not a modern text."
3,johnwwalker,"sirs-the book is good. however,there is a problem. i mistakenly order two copies of the same book but i refused delivery of the second copy.pls arange for book lagoon to reimburse my credit card account for the book that i returned. thank you john w walker"
3,Den mas t'apes ola gia to '21 kyra Daskala ...,"Did you know that beloved Mboumboulina slaughtered many thousands of civilians in Tripolitsa? Did you know that the rich landowners and the church officials were against the revolution? Did you know that 95% of the millions of pounds given by phillellines for the revolution were stolen by its leaders? etc., etc. Greek history is a whore and ought to be re-written.(Check the book ""Mia Stagona Istoria"" Volume 1)."
3,First fruits,"I have a few of the books of this series. The type is a size that is agreeable to the eyes.It is in a serif style and the color is a dense black.The paper is aged ,yellowish:ochre. The text is informative and is easy to read.The eight color reproductions are not up to current standards ,but for over a hundred years the reproductions hold up , I couldn't find another repro of ""Sacred and Profane love"" sixty years ago in Ryerson library of theArt Institute of Chicago by Titian.My attempt at the subject,wasn't successful.My copy of Turner in this seriesI profited from studying.For under ten dollars this is a good buy."
3,"Great writer, alright book...","In all fairness to Y. Blak Moore, Clair from Massachusetts stated that the book glorified violence, etc. but judging from the cover, any reader who reads the back of the book will already know it before they flip the pages. Therefore, if you have a problem with guns, violence, graphic sex, and foul language, this is NOT the book for you. If you like realistic dialogue, dry humor, organized plots, and edgy books, then this is. I'm a little spit when it came to this book. I think the author is very talented at telling a story. I also think he's organized, educated, and stays true to his character's personalities. I didn't care for the plot either though, but the reason I gave it a three was not because of the plot (I already knew that) but because the end dragged on much too long for me."
4,Triple take a Hit!,"This book I just stumbled upon while browsing the book store in Forestville, Maryland. I tell you, I was hooked from the word go. However, the events that took place was nothin short of ""wishful thinking"". The plan was well put together. And keeps you interested. Big ups to the author! I'll be looking for you.Hey and if ever there's a JC in town I'll be your Champagne.Peace!"
4,great book-u gotta read it,"Y. Blak Moore is an awesome author. All of his books are very well written, you get a feel for the characters and the plots are captivating. He is very knowledgable about the subject matter and know how to translate it to hold the reader's interest. Triple Take is non stop action from beginning to end and leaves you wanting more."
5,Triple Take-Tiple AWESOME,"this book is amazing, once you start reading you are hooked on every word, i paid more attention to this book than the TV that was on in the same room. a must read for anyone who likes a book where you think"
5,BEST FIGURE EVER,"I love this figure. The best RVD figure ever i love this attire. This is a must have. RVD is the man. I cant get over how good this figure looks. RVD is ECW,WWE,AND FLAT OUT HARDCORE AMAZING. I lOVE R V D AND AJ STYLES I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THEM. If i could i would give this figure 10 stars."
5,my favorite relaxation CD,"Going through a particularly anxious period, I began looking for relaxation CD's. Of the dozen or so I own, this one is my and several of my friends' favorite."
5,"Beautiful, healing music!","Just what I needed to create harmony in my emotions. A blessing! Susan Kelley, AuthorPrescription for Addiction"
4,Fabulous but Music a bit short for Sessions,"I always loved Merlin's Magic, I think it is always the best music for meditation, this album 's music is fabulous however each song is a bit short for a full meditation session, but still, it is a very good relaxation album that I will recommend to my friends."
5,I am delighted,5 Bright Stars! Merlin's Magic is so easy to listen to and it is perfect for my healing therapy practice.DrSteve
2,Questionable Quality,"Great design, doesn't tip over like the MacLaren strollers... but the footrest fell off after a few months of use. Granted, the Britax customer service was wonderful and resent us another stroller immediately, but then the snaps of the basket on the new stroller were a bit off and wouldn't clip on. Obviously a problem with quality control. Although I love the design, I would not recommend this stroller to anyone simply because I can't trust the quality. Too bad because the Britax car seats are one of the most trusted brands."
4,GREAT STROLLER BUT LITTLE EXTRAS,"THIS IS A GOOD STROLLER EASY TO UNFOLD AND PUT AWAY, GREAT FOR AIRPORTS, AND LIGHT WEIGHT, I JUST WISH IT HAD SOMEMORE STORAGE UNDERNEATH AND A SNACK TRAY FOR TOYS OR SNACKS."
3,"Nice, but a few problems","The stroller has a great look and the attached bag is super; however, I have a few safety concerns. I've used this stroller twice and both times it spontaneously folded up - with my son in the seat. I have contacted Britax about this issue and will be sending it to them for repair. If I were doing it again, I'd hold off a year on this purchase until Britax works out the ""bugs."""
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS STROLLER FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT STROLLER FOR MY 2 1/2 YEAR OLD SON, WE ARE GOING ON VACATION TO DISNEY WORLD AND I WANTED SOMETHING EASY TO CARRY ONCE FOLDED. ONCE I OPENED THE STROLLER AND TRIED IT OUT I HATED IT. I HAVE A JEEP LIBERTY URBAN TERRIAN LIMITED WHICH I LOVE SO MAYBE I AM A BIT SPOILED, BUT THE JEEP STROLLER IS I BIT TO BIG TO FOLD UP AND TAKE ON TRAMS AND BUSES IN DISNEY WITHOUT MY HUSBAND THERE. I HAVE A BRITAX MARATHON CAR SEAT WHICH I ALSO LOVE SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SAFE BET, BOY WAS I WRONG.IT IS HARD TO FOLD, HARD TO STEER AND NOT VERY COMFORTABLE FOR A TODDLER, THE BASKET COULD ONLY HOLD MY POCKETBOOK AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD FIT AND THEN WHEN MY SON WANTED TO RECLINE, I HAD TO TAKE THE POCKETBOOK OUT SO IT WOULD RECLINE PROPERLY.AGAIN, I AM USED TO THE JEEP STROLLER WHICH HAS A SUPER HUGE BAKET THAT YOU CAN EVEN GET THINGS IN AND OUT WHEN IT IS FULLY RECLINED. I AM TAKING THE BRITAX PREVIEW STROLLER BACK TO THE STORE TOMORROW."
1,I hate this stroller,"I bought this stroller 4 months ago and if I could I would return it. It is very difficult to fold/unfold, it is not confortable and my son hate it, it is hard to manuver, well, I hate it all!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"5 Stars for the songs on the cd.1 Star for the awful tinny sound quality of this disc, by far the worst I've heard from this otherwise great series of cd's. My 10 cut budget cd of Jan & Dean from the same label(EMI),sounds better! I'm glad I bought it fairly cheap."
2,so so,I bought this CD thinking it would be up-dated...Wrongthe selections that start it off stink! And the quality is poor...
4,Surf city The best of Jan&Dean CD,"Great record with music typical for the sixtees (surfsound) ""The Anaheim Azusa and Cooka monga sewing circle, bookreview and association"" is an absolute cracker."
4,Concise,"This is a concise volume, as opposed to some like Wallace. This book was fairly clear and helpful, it's worth having."
2,Manufacturing Of A Product Is The First Criteria,"I got two of these from one company that wouldn't play. I then got one from Amazon, directly, and this one wouldn't play either. I would love to review it, but the way a company manufactures a product matters as much as the content. Update: I finally got a copy that worked and I am sorry I went through all the trouble. There is so little material and it's so unmethodical that it really is a waste of time. The few examples they give you are super weak as well. It's kind of like, here, here are a few types of funk patterns - that's the DVD. I know other DVDs do the same thing, and I own a lot of them, but this one just seems extremely weak and a waste of money. I am not exaggerating when I say that I could have done a much better job."
1,OUTTAH THE DUST,"I honestly could not stand this book. I had to read this book as an assignment. Every night before I went to bed I was able to read less than 10 pages before I fell asleep from boredom. Hesse did do a good job describing the dust bowl, esspecially for not having lived there. Don't judge Hesse by this one book though, Music of Dolphins is a great book. The other titles by Hesse that you should stay away from are Letters From Rifka and Walk Two Moons, for they both were boring beyond comparsion (except to each other)"
2,High Expectations Unrealized...,This is a fair cd. The problem is it is not as good as the first Rendevous Lounge. Round one was a classic with great cut after great cut. Round 2 has good cuts but in my mind none stands out or has a must have quality. As is often the case with movie sequels this cd doesn't compare. However it is not bad as passive background music.
3,manufacturing method of methanol,I am a engineer of fuel.I am very interesting in manufacturing method of methanol with LPMEOH technology.
4,Everything was fine,"The DVD arrived quickly and in great condition. Somehow I had missed seeing this Dalgliesh when it was (probably) on Mystery years ago. I enjoyed seeing Roy Marsden again and the storyline was very good. Once it ended, I understood who the murderer was but it had been handled very well all through the show. No red herrings, but no giveaways either.If you like P.D. James and you like Marsden as Dalgliesh, you should definitely watch this."
3,More fun than I expected.,"After all the reviews I've read of the two movies that make up this DVD I expected them to be abysmal failures along the lines of Plan Nine From Outer Space. Well, yes, they are both in the ""so bad it's good"" category, and I haven't seen the MST3000 treatments (I imagine they are hilarious) but Prince of Space and Invasion of the Neptune Men are a hoot, and this DVD with vintage drive-in movie interstitials and trailers is a lot of fun. Honestly, I think if I had seen these when I was seven or eight years old, back in those pre-Star Wars days, I would loved them on their own terms as good old-fashioned space operas. Bonus points for a 21-year-old leotard-clad Sonny Chiba in Neptune Men."
5,"""Prince of Spaaaaace""","""Prince of Space"" is a hilariously madcap cheap Japanese drive-in flick about Wally the shoeshine boy whose secret identity is the eponymous masked ""Prince of Space."" While Clark Kent works at the Daily Planet, Bruce Wayne is a reclusive gazillionaire,and Peter Parker a nerdy guy... Wally shines shoes and acts as a ""mother and father"" to a couple of bratty kids. Soon, however, Wally finds himself in the battle to save the world from extremely aquiline-nosed aliens (with their obnoxiously chuckling ringleader,the Phantom) from the planet Krankhor. The dialogue is ludicrous. The ""special"" effects will have you in stitches. The acting is so bad is laughable. Prince of Space knows how to choose incompetent enemies (and equally incompetent allies). As he repeatedly says, ""Your guns are useless!"" With or without MST3K's snarky remarks,""Prince of Space"" saves the day with its cheesy dialogue, ludicrous costumes, and sub-par acting. Enjoy!"
2,not what ya would expect,somehow i saw sony chiba was in those movies acording to the dvd credits he is not so don't buy it hoping to watch sony chiba
5,"Well played, melodic, romantic, but solid jazz","This is just a favorite of mine for feeling good, while enjoying the high quality playing of Rick Margitza, who's just a solid player, spirited, disciplined, with excellent chops. He can lay smooth and he can dig in with a strong edge and great breadth of ideas. You'll dig the first-rate sidemen: Joey Calderazzo (p) Jim Beard (syn) Steve Masakowski (g, el-g) Marc Johnson (b) Adam Nussbaum (d) Airto Moreira (per). Margitza, post-Miles, has only attracted top players. And he's only improved since this album...good luck Rick!!!"
4,A Box of Chocolates,"It's like a box of chocolate, You never know what you gonna get until you listen to it!!Is it sad that my personal favourite is not added into this CD. If you have listened to I Still Believe - Krayzie Bone remix, you will find it unique and special, totally unexpected and original by its own.To my opinion, MC Remixes have something for everyone. Those party goer will definately find it amusing and glad for this CD while original fans got to feel MC's creativity on the remixes.Other noticeable tracks includes The One, Breakdown and Miss You.All in all, if you are an MC fan, there is something for you to add to your collection as some songs are very 'original' while those who like remixes, it is definately a MUST have! Try play those songs when there is a party, they will go wild!"
2,blah,"I love Mariah's voice and a lot of her older stuff. I have to agree with a previous review about the guest rappers though. There are several songs that just drone on and on and have no energy. I was looking for some good remixes of her songs and I was pretty much let down. Overall, I'd say this wasnt a good purchase."
2,"and what about the ""I Still Believe/Pure Imagination"" remix?","This CD is also missing the ""I Still Believe/Pure Imagination"" remix. I loved that remix. It was like that song from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""This REMIX album has songs on it that are NOT EVEN REMIXED, while some of the BEST remixes are left off!"
3,This had the ability to be so much better....,"While I am a huge Mariah fan, of both her original albums and CD single remixes, this compilation just doesn't do it for me. There were so many good remixes that were left off in favor of numerous Mariah-rapper collaborations...especially on the second disc. And...the techno/dance songs that were chosen Why? What is going on? Remix means REMIX! It doesn't mean the same formula hashed over several different songs. Come on now....I sure hope the next Mariah remix album will be better than this one....."
3,Not half bad,"way to many rap remixes, and not enough dance mixes, like the omitted Mariahs Theme(can't take that away ),Someday,and Boy(i need you). However diehard mariah fans will love this collection."
1,Why Would Anyone Buy This?,"Mariah Carey has had an impressive career. but disco diva she is not. her dance remixes are awful. i cant remember them ever being popular and if they were it must have been a passing moment. they are boring and very dated. nothing that can stand up next to the music or remixes of today. the hip hop remixes are good, but they are on all her other albums and everyone already has them. theres only one new song, and its not even good. dont waste your money."
3,Not her best CD,"Honestly I was excited to get this cd but exremely disappointed. I was expecting dance remixes by people like Mike Rizzo, Hex Hector, etc. Instead we have all these rapino dance versions which sound like something out of the 80s. It has no originality. I think the version of through the rain and heartbreaker are the best. All of the others are just plain with no creativity. They have just regular beats mixed in with the song and it is like slow club, nothing you would here in New York City. The second cd is the R&b groove cd which is good but I Mainly was expecting the dance versions to be better."
2,Such a wasted use for an album,"I have been a huge MC fan since 1993. I own all her albums. This, however, was a joke! Instead of putting the full length remixes on the 1st CD, they should have included the shorter ""edit"" versions to make room for RARE remixes that most folks haven't heard (aka Butterfly, Butterfly (Reprise), Do You Know, Emotions, Fantasy, The Roof, ABMB, Can't Take That Away, etc.) These remixes done by Morales, DJ Meme, and others are only found on her rare Mexican & Brazilian promos. Why not include those on a CD like this? It's not like they don't own the rights to the songs. The 2nd CD is a bit better. However, why include songs that clearly aren't remixes? Clearly Sony threw this together at the last moment. Dont waste your time. Do what I did and make a CD of those songs on your own."
3,Again nice to hear different versions of her songs,Fine production of her songs with various artists that score at times and at others seem to be a vanity project for the guests joining her...still enjoyable.
2,Since when is Mariah techno?,"I am a HUGE Mariah fan and was so excited when I saw this CD. But when i listened to the first CD, I spent 2 minutes waiting to hear mariah sing something. The first CD is mostly techno beats...and they all sound the same. The second Cd was ok, it didn't have the same beats, but I'm not into the rappers talking and that kinda stuff. If you are expecting to hear Mariah's beautiful voice singing on thus, don't buy this CD."
5,This is The Cd Mariah wanted 5 years ago,"The Remixes is a great collection of her greatest hits in 2 discs! Disc one is the dance remixes, and disc 2 contains the hip-hop mixes. Both Cds are spectacular. Mariah outdid herself in this cd of previously released material."
4,Good CD,"I do like this cd especially the first disc. I'm not too fond of rap, so the second disc I;m fast forwarded quite a bit.I think they could've had some remixes of her older songs to date like vision of love and someday. That would've been something!I think her best songs are butterfly, emotions, fantasy and her gospel tinged remix of anytime you need a friend, it sounds fantastic! Over all, even though I don't love every single song on this cd, its still a great cd."
3,Mariah:Remixed,"A collection of Mariah's best mixes. A definite purchase for any Mariah fan out there. Also a great purchase for any dance music/club music fan. A nice listen for hip-hop audiences as well. However, if you are into Mariah's more pop based songs, this is not an album for you to purchase. There is one track on here I had not heard before which actually was a little popish called ""Miss You"" and is probably one of the highlights of this album. There are some very good remixes on here ""Heartbreaker/If You Should Ever Be Lonely"", ""Thank God I Found You/Make It Last Forever"" are 2 of those highlights...there are also a couple of tracks on here which really aren't remixes at all...such as ""Sweetheart"" with Jermaine Dupri, ""Crybaby"" with Snoop Dogg & ""Breakdown"" with Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone. Those are the original album versions, however I do love the track ""Breakdown""...nevertheless this is a worthwhile purchase for many out there with the possible exception of the ""pop"" Mariah fans."
1,how many times can i re-release my old hits?,"how many times can i re-release my old hits? that is obviously what mariah is doing since people aren't buying the new stuff. this is the third complete album that have the same songs on them. the #1s album was cool. all the good songs was is 1 cd. then she released the 2 disc greatest hits album, which were the same songs on the #1s, but she added songs from rainbow. now we have the remixes. why? i know it was just to complete her contract with sony, but as an artist that loves her fans soooo much, why do this us? first off, the first disc (for lack of a better word) sucks. it has a bunch of outdated club beats that have literally been used to death by other artist. then, the second disc are the video versions. don't get me wrong, mariah has a great talent, but after butterfly, that was it. my opinion, don't waste your money. i can see true, die-hard mariah fans buying this one just because it's mariah, but if you have the #1s stop there."
1,THIS IS STRAIGHT UP TRASH,"I wouldnt advise anyone to buy this JUNK. I mean I wouldnt wish this cd on my worse enemy. This is a perfect example of Mariah showing how lazy she is couldnt even bother to put a new song on this CRAP! NO WONDER ITS A FLOPP NOBODY BUY CRAP MARIAH BESIDES YOUR STUPID FANS! AND NOT ALL OF THEM BOUGHT IT I MEAN IT DIDNT EVEN SELL MORE THEN 75,000 HELL IT SOLD LESSER THEN THAT LOL DONT BY TRASH CAUSE THATS OBVIOUSLY MARIAH!"
2,A Waste of Money,I just got the new Mariah Carey Remixes CD. I only really liked two songs but the others I just kept skipping. The original songs are so much better. Pass on this one...
1,Bad and sad,"I must say I didn't even bother listening to this album and I won't even buy it, cause I think Mariah is just getting worse and worse. With such a wonderful voice she could have made such great music instead of those pretentious, rap-overloaded, unmelodious songs. Since she got into that hip-hop, r&b kind of music her songs tend more and more to be like a excuse for her to display her 'singing technique' instead of really singing. I've been a fan of her early singing years and I think those were the best. And even when she appears on any show she looks like a stupid dumb, ungraceful doll. It's a real shame cause this girl has an incredible voice but truly used in the wrong way."
5,LOVE IT!,"Beautiful, energizing and need to buy another one b/c this one is worn out from so much play!!!!"
3,"what about ""The Roof"" remix?","This CD is great because a lot of Mariah's hits. I was hoping this remix album would have ""The Roof"" remix featuring Mobb Deep, but it doesn't. If not for those songs that aren't even remixes, like ""Sweetheart,"" ""Crybaby,"" or ""Breakdown,"" there would have been plenty of room for ""The Roof."" Plus, those songs are already available on other albums, while none of Mariah's other albums have ""The Roof"" remix on it."
5,Excellent DVD Audio,This is an excellent DVD Audio disc. It sounds superb on my Denon player. Brilliant DVD Audio sound. The DTS is also good (who would even try the 2 channel if you bought this disc). I recommend this disc to any fan of Brazilian music and anyone interested in fine sound reproduction!
5,"Nice, easys listening, great jazz","The music was what I expected: great brazilian jazz, easy listening.I bought it partially to test the DTS functionality of my audio setup and the DVD does a very nice job in that respect, too.The DVD does include both Audio and Video. I didn't expect any video as the disk is being sold as ""DVD Audio"". The background pictures are quite nice and it is interesting to read the details about the track being played. The only drawback of course is that you need to know your way around ""blindly"" if you don't want to switch on your TV and only want to listen to the audio tracks - but blind navigation is easy enough to remember."
2,Meh,"Overall, I was unsatisfied with this product. The candy tasted quite bitter. I'd rather stick with the root beer flavor I have been buying."
1,Problems with this product,"Previously had Versacheck 2000 for MS WINDOWS. This was a great product. The Premium is a different story. Disk would not load and had to get another one. Some of the features did not work and the ""help"" feature is not much help. Tried to use the Web site for tech help and could not get any. If you email the tech people directly it costs you a fee. There is no 800 number for help. Would not recommend this product."
1,Buy this and you're on your own,"I used VersaCheck 2000 for a year or so, and it was OK. Nothing fantastic, but usable. When I upgraded to Windows XP, I purchased VersaCheck 2002 which turned out to be a step backwards. The set up was sloppy and getting items to print was very difficult. Last month the program turned up an error nothing I could do would revive it. I couldn't even get in to access the ""Help"" feature. I went to the G7 web site and it appears they will only ""sell"" you help at a high price. I wrote emails to G7 on 3 separate occasions and have received no replies at all. If you buy this and it works, you're lucky. If there's a problem, you won't get help from G7. There must be better programs than this clunker that offers no support. Based on my disappointing experience, I recommend that you avoid VersaCheck. I feel ripped off."
2,"Amusing account of Noah's flood, however lacks scientific evidence","I found this book to be quite naive about many archaeological accounts of a world flood. Many false assumptions are made here about Biblical verses as well.This book does not give a scientifically backed account of Noah's ark. If you are looking for a good account of the flood check out ""The New Answers Book"" by Ken Ham. Good luckThe New Answers Book 1 (Answers Book Series)"
4,twists within twists,Ms Moon gave us another nice space opera with her unique 'wheel within wheel' plot. It is very refreshing for Ms Moon to write a story where the main character isn't a military person.
2,Why bother,"As a fan of Elizabeth Moon's Serrano series I looked forward to a new space adventure. However, I am also a fan of Bujold's Vorkosigan series and Trading in Danger's plot bears a suspicious resemblence to the plot in Warrior's Apprentice. See below.1) In both books the protagonist has been kicked out of the military.2) In both books the protagonist gets hold of an old merchant vessel.3) In Warrior's apprentice, the hero knowingly takes on a cargo of weapons which are being passed off as ""agricultrual implements"". In Trading in Danger its a load of tractors - both shipments are taken into a war zone.4) Both take on board some hard luck cases5) Both ships are boarded by mercenaries - to continue would be to spoil the plot of the better book - Warrior's Apprentice. Overall Trading in Danger seems to be a weak copy of an excellent book. So as I said, why bother with this one?"
3,Middle of the road,"This was a slow dense read. While it was very well written, Trading in Danger felt like a short story with a lot of boring business exposition thrown in to pad it out to novel length.I've never read anything by this author before, but the more I look into her backlist, I see that this book is a retread. I'm going to read the next one because I've already bought it.Ky is a likable enough character who spends too much time in her head. No one else sticks out. The bureacracy Ky is up against is the most interesting antagonist.I sincerely hope the next volume is better."
3,"Plodding, by the numbers retread","If you've read the Heris Serrano books, or the Esmay Suiza books, you've seen this book done better. The pacing of the book is even, but excruciatingly slow. The book is more similar to Legacy of Gird and Liar's Oath, than to Moon's other books. It feels as if a particularly uninspired author pounded this one out to meet a deadline.The book starts quickly, but predictably, setting up the story. It then slows terribly and despite the trials, tribulations and dangers our protagonist suffers, it is difficult to be emotionally engaged.The ending gets better though, showing Captain Ky getting on her own feet without family, or academy and shows promise for the next book. Without the ending this book was perilously close to being a 2 or 1 star book."
1,A Romance Novel without the romance,"This was the first Elizabeth Moon book I have read, and it probably will be the last. I am not sure how this one got published. Glad I borrowed it from the library.I didn't see a purpose to the book. The events were not particularly interesting. No plot twists. Not an event-driven book. Characters were barely 1 dimensional, and other than Ky were not at all explored--and Ky was not particularly explored. I found the attitudes of her mother and aunt to be current, even though this is supposedly set in the future. So, not a character-driven book. Technology was pretty much standard with nothing new. Not a technology-driven book.Reminded me of Harlequin Romance Novel without the romance."
2,Be Alerted,"Unless you are between the ages of 11 and 14, this book is godawful, cardboard, and by rote."
3,"The story is great, the narrator is horrid","While I thoroughly enjoy the characters and plot of Ms. Moon's creation, Ms. Halloway's narration leaves MUCH to be desired. She frequently reads the wrong word (i.e., ""thorough-put"" for through-put, ""designed"" for designated, etc.). I find myself just wanting to scream at her. Her voices for various characters are extremely similar, in places making it difficult to distinguish who is speaking. I'm very surprised that there wasn't better ""prooflistening"" before this book was released. This is one of the few audiobooks I've ever listened to in which the narrator so detracted from the story that I quit listening, found a copy of the book and read it for myself."
5,Enjoyable read.,"I picked this book up, not sure I would read it, or even finish it. I read it in 1 day. Ms Moon has created a cast of characters that I really want to see succeed, and cared what happened to them. She also created a world that was believable, without being over sci-fi technical and long boring detail or description about stuff. I recommend this to others."
4,"A fun read, don't take it too seriously","Other reviews point out several problems, and while I generally agree with them, I really enjoyed reading this book. It moves along at a good clip and the setting is well imagined.I should say, though, that I love stories set in this kind of a ""space tramp freighter"" environment, so I could be biased. If you read this book and like the setting, make sure you read CJ Cherryh's work (Downbelow Station, Merchanter's Luck, Chanur series). That is the standard which this book tries to reach. Older sci-fi readers may also remember Poul Anderson's many books and short stories with a similar setting."
1,Mac Si-Fi,"Yet another mass produced si-fi story apt for quick consumption, with but minimal entertainment value. A simplistic, linear plot and stereotype characters like they come straight out of a space sim like Privateer or Freelancer. Any Star Trek episode has more depth.As with fast food, consume infrequently - if you must. There is so much better stuff out there."
2,Great book - Terrible narration,This is a great book. Buy it and READ it.Just DON'T BUY the audio version. The narrator is terrible and ruins the whole thing.
3,Slow start for new series,"""Trading in Danger"" centers around Ky Vatta. Who, keeping with E.Moon's style, was unjustly persecuted and misunderstood. She must redeem herself. The book gets off to a slow start. I happen to like Elizabeth Moon's ""style"" so I kept reading. The action starts around chapter 6. There's a lot of talk about freight, contracts, and money. That was kind of boring to me. But, I guess you have to discuss that stuff if your main character is a freight ship captain."
3,"Below her usual, still above most everyone else","Having read Moon's ""Deed of Paksenarion"" trilogy, ""Remnant Population"", ""The Speed of Dark"" and some of her short stories, this was - something of a disapointment.The main character is irritating, in some ways; the actions and thoughts of everyone around her are overly focused on her. This may be an author's way of emphasizing what an extrordinarry person she is not through her own words but through the thoughts of others; if this is so then it's overkill and boggs down what it's supposed to help.She's yet another adventuresome girl with military training from a rich family who has ""destined for great adventure"" written all over her, in size 72 bold font. This isn't so much a story in it's own right as it is a prelude to the story of this girl's life, off in space with her own ship to adventure.Still, it's Elizabeth Moon, and I'll read the next books and follow her adventures. It's bound to get better, and I've certainly read many worse."
3,Decent work,"Not as engaging as her previous series (Hunting Party et al), but still a good read. Compared to her older works, it seems a bit abbreviated."
4,Moon delivers as usual,"In this book, Moon creates another strong female lead with a military background. However, she takes her someplace a little different than Harris and Esmay. Having read all of her previous books, I was pleasantly surprised that the usual plot twists had unusual resolutions. The characterization is good, but the plot moves a little slowly for my taste. All in all, the high quality entertainment that I expect when I pick up a Moon book, but not such a spectacular story as to merit five stars."
1,Used Junk,"Well, let me start by saying this product was Used... I bought a NEW amp from the seller. I have pictures of the destroyed packaging, missing screws to hold the top cover on, no directions or warranty card and wires still connected to the unit where they obviously cut it off the display shelf. I wrote them an email 1 week ago and have not heard back from them. The only good that came out of it is it arrived on time for Memorial weekend and sounded good. I've been an big fan of Alpine amp's but will be more cautious of where I by the product(Shutterblade of New York).Buyer beware!"
3,old school,"old school songs, musical arrangements simple and does not challenge your sound system. However still nice smooth tracks. Easy listening."
2,Divinity of Weird.,"I think based on the reviews I am way in the minority, but there are no normal characters. We have the mother of three children painting rasians all day. Her husband who is the typical high strung money hungry man until his heart attack is the bad guy. The daughters are one type A the other a free spirit with past lives who thinks she is African American. The son lives in the woods because he killed someone. That is the story in a nut shell except for Grandma Pearl who is gay without coming out. Then there are chapters about the death of a dog that go on and on. I listened to this on Audio and had it not be time in traffic I would have thrown this out the window. If you are a new age kind of person, go for it. This is for you. IF you want the real world, and normal characters don't check this out. This is the second book by this author and my last."
1,Do Not buy,"These mirror boards are a waste of money. There is no ""mirror"", just a shiny silver material that does not have a reflection."
2,"This is 2012, We have the Internet","These audio things don't work for me. You'll learn a few phrases, some pronunciation, but 4.50 for this? Just go on the internet, all this sort of content is free now, just search learn german."
2,the heat,"They Melt very easily when the modeling lamp is on, one went on me wile still positioning the light with my first setup using them."
3,"Cute, but eyes lopsided! Needed a little more TLC in production...","I ordered this owl for my 2 year old daughter who developed a fascination with owls. The item is ALMOST as described, cute, durable but my only complaint is that the eyes on my owl are lopsided and off center. It's as if someone just glued them on in a hurry. The left eye is waaaay too far over on the side of the owl's head. Very obvious to everyone who sees it. I noticed it the second I unpacked the box. Makes the owl look really goofy. Not a big deal, really except that an owl's eyes are it's main facial feature, right? If the person who screwed up making the item didn't really care, that's one thing, but then the company who packed and shipped it to me obviously didn't look at it either...or didn't care. It's not major enough that I would return the bird, but I won't order from this company again. Just sloppy, that's all."
3,Osmond is Okay,Cute but does not really look the photo. The photo looks much better. Face and body looks cream/tan instead of white.
2,Nothing like the photo,"The coloration of this owl is TOTALLY different than the photo. The photo shows a white and grey owl, but the actual owl in my hand is brown and orang-y. The top of the head and wings are brown; the chest an orange shade. The beak is sewn on crooked. The eyes have deep painted-on ""eyelids"" making the eyes look half closed. On this owl the eyes don't match, so the owl looks bored, very tired, or drunk! I'm so disappointed...based on the photo I thought this would be a cute ""Harry Potter"" type owl stocking stuffer. The price was cheap: $4.99 (now I know why). But shipping was $2.00 and now I have to pay again to send it back! Not happy...."
4,Birthday gift,I ordered this for my granddaughter's birthday. She loves owls1 it arrived in a timely manner. Good purchase. No problems.
3,book spine was pulled apart..............the book content was fine.,The information contained inthe book was fine. But the book's spine was pulled apart and I expected to have a book in better condition.
1,received wrong size from company,"although a cute shoe, it fits a little more narrow than other charles david shoes i own. also, the vendor sent me the wrong size. there was a sticker covering the real size on the bottom of the shoe and came 1/2 size too small."
2,painful,These shoes are cute like the other reviewer said and it is narrow. But i don't recommend wearing these shoes for more than an hour. Beneath the circle and the straps the material is not smooth and will burn through your skin if you wear them for too long. The top views of the shoes are more accurate than the first picture.
1,hell it's freakin' boring...,"I tried to listen to the whole cd but my ears just got bored. For some reason, his voice is just too flat for the notes. I just don't know why this album received such a high rating. These other idiots maybe on drugs and drunk at the same time. Bored me to death. Not even single squirrel would want to listen to this crap."
4,"Adds the ""Chicago"" groove to your favorite yultide tunes!","Overall, it's fun to hear how Chicago has taken and reworked popular Christmas tunes. Some with great success, others only moderately so. ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" features Bill Champlin on vocals, and the great brass arrangements Chicago is known for. Also especially good is ""Let It Snow"" with brass player Lee Loughnane taking lead vocals -- a great arrangement, and maybe a guy who needs to sing more oftern; it's terrific. Some, like ""O come All Ye Faithful,"" ""Silent Night"" and ""God Rest Ye Merry Genltlemen"" don't fare as well, partially due to Jason Scheff's screetchy vocals -- they might have done well to have taken them all down musically about a third. For Chicago fans, it's a ""must own"" - for others, not as adept to the band, think about it."
4,Chicago's slant on Christmas is innovative & thrilling!,Chicago XXV is dominated by great vocals and the brass section. Bill Champlin lead and backing vocals dominate this effort. What Child Is This? is breathtaking and really showcases his tallents. He even gets funky with his organ playing and soulful voice on Santa Clause is Coming To Town. Then Robert Lamm does his thing on Christmas Time Is Here. He also has lead vocals on three other songs. This album continues Lamm's return to the forefront as a vocal force for this band which started with Night & Day (Big Band). The horn section blares throughout the CD also a continuation from Night & Day. My 7 year old daughter just loves this CD and so will you!
2,A mixed bag,"Pankow's horn arrangments are in fine form and the old Chicago harmonies are wonderful when they show up. However, much of the album is too pop, ""new"" Chicago and not enough the greatness of Chicago's 1-7.The nasal opening vocal of ""Little Drummer Boy"" starts the album off on a sour note, though the song recovers in the second two verses (one with a great gospel choir, and the next with 4 part old school harmonies. This typifies the album, part average and part great.There are a few standout songs on this album like a wonderful arrangement of ""Christmas Song"", the very fun ""Santa Clause Is Coming to Town"", and a good revival of ""Christmas Time is here"" (yes of Charlie Brown fame).I'll include probably 1/3 of the album on my MP3 playlist for Christmas songs, but if I had prelistened to the album, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,LET IT SNOW!!!!,"I've been a fan of Chicago since about 1971. I could listen to ""Let is Snow"" 24 hrs a day!! I can't believe how much this song rocks; Lee Loughnane's amazing vocals; the horns!!It's as if it's 1975 again and the band has found its roots.The CD is far from perfect; some tracks hit, others miss, BUTThat song just floors me . . . this version is made to crank up as you cruise down the highway."
3,Robert,"The album's best songs are ""let it snow"" and ""the Christmas Song"". Both of these songs remind me of Chicago of the 70's."
1,Spike the eggnog...Your'e gonna need it.,"I purchased this CD a few years ago, hoping for a solid effort from this talented legendary band....Just horrible renditions of classic Christmas songs that do not deserve this kind of treatment.This CD just sounds sickening to me.There are so many horrible versions of Christmas songs, and the vocals?????C'mon guys your better than this....or at least you used to be.Simply the WORST Christmas CD I've ever heard."
5,Great Christmas Gift from Chicago,"This CD is my most favarite christmas record.Some tracks are popular Christmas songs, but Chicago plays them in their great performance. So if you were not familiar to this band, you may enjoy enough. Especially Chicago's many Lead Vocalists(Bobby Lamm, Bill Champlin, etc )that have each some different singing style and voice, make very colourful Christmas party. Personally, I like Jason's ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" best. And ""Let it snow"" sung by Trumpetter Lee Loughnane is a very nice tune, too.(The band plays this song at their show often.) I think this is one of the most successful Christmas CD by single artist(Songer or Band)."
3,One song is worth the price,This is a creative CD. They don't just duplicate songs that have been done over and over. They play new songs and play old songs as if they were new And one new song--Child's Prayer--is worth the price of the CD itself. Simply stunning!
5,acoustically speaking,"This Cd has the perfect blend of flamenco style guitar with a traditional jazz blend. Up beat or smooth, made me feel like dancing! Really put me in a positive mood. Nice work."
1,the same old stuff,"This album sounds like his old one. I expected more new songs, it's the same kind of music, nothing seems to change..."
4,Comparisons are always subjective...,"Er, who's Neutral Milk Hotel? I must be getting old, because actually I thought of Robyn Hitchcock when I first heard this band. The world needs more bands like the Decemberists--original songwriting, accordions, a twist of Edward Gorey, a sense of humor. Both full-length albums are worthy of extended listening."
5,1-2 punch,"Tracks 9 and 10, Clementine and California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade as good as any two consecutive tracks you will find. Anywhere."
3,great album,"these guys are a great band. you'll enjoy their music and smart lyrics. donewaiting.com sponsored a show of theirs in columbus, ohio. cannot wait to hear what they'll do next."
2,Imitation is the Greatest Form of Flattery,"This is a great cd i really like it. But the fact thats its basically a blatant rip of the great NMH albums ,leaves me not really enjoying this album as much as I should. A little more originality would have been appreciated. If it wasnt for NMH I'd give this album a 4, but its just such a rip-off. I do suggest you get it though because it is fine music."
1,*hurl*,"I've been strugging for a long time to describe The Decemberists in one phrase in a way that suited me, but an issue of NME a few months ago beat me to the punch - ""Like the Arcade Fire if they were from the Renaissance and rubbish"". ""...Architect"" is a good song, but the rest is, for lack of a better word, ass-water. Avoid this album. Hell, avoid this band."
4,NMH comparsions false,"I'm familiar with Neutral Milk Hotel, and the claims that this is a cheap knock-off is bogus. On the surface , they both use acoustic quitar heavily, and both lead singers have a nasal voice ( although NMH's lead singer is much more obnoxious with his at times, almost to the point of sounding like nails on a cHalkboard), but thats about where the similiarities end.NMH lyrics rely heavily on obscure metaphors,which many times seems to make no sense... while Decemberists is more of a storytelling style.Overall a good CD and not a rip-off. I should know, considering NMH annoys the hell out of me, but i actually enjoyed this CD."
3,In Your Ear: The Decemberists,"I came across The Decemberists just recently. I'm currently listening to Castaways and Cutouts and am pleased with it. Fans of Coldplay and Elbow might be pleased as well, especially if you can get over the vocalist's slightly slurred approach to singing.Outstanding tracks include Leslie Anne Levine -- a ballad, strange enough -- and July, July -- a poppy, rock song."
4,great pop tunes,What a great album.Very consistent. Great lyrics and songs. I would've like to have heard the production a little less polished.
3,"Noticeable, if not grabbing first album from frontman and co.","3 1/2Often vacillating between pretty and grating, this whimsical band led by a wordy, nasal, imaginary historian leaves few great tracks amongst less spectacular fare, but still maintains a solid summation fans of less aggressive indie rock may enjoy. It seems all the gentle factors which really make this band work, (perceptive and unique vocals, sensitive arrangements, old-world touches) work great when properly balanced, but have a tendency to backfire when improperly exploited. It may not maintain throughout, but this debut offered more then enough songwriting finesse to get people noticing."
3,Yngwie is Yngwie....if you know what I mean,"It's a good enough DVD and if you're wanting to see if an electric guitar concerto is actually a decent idea, it's worth the money. That said, though, Yngwie's classic over-the-top desire to cram goo-gobs of notes into any and all passages, whether or not they fit, gets a bit annoying at times. When he slows down and actually feels the passion of a piece, he's a genius, and his arrangements for the symphony orchestra playing behind him are nice and tasty. But even for an old Yngwie fan, it's a little too much sometimes."
3,staged,A rock performance with an orchestra just does not have the live arena audience feel. It feels rigid and structured.It does not have the freedom and and innovations with the members of the band.
1,"YJM , Sad sad sad..and plays like a fool!","YJM is dressed like an dandy prat, and plays like his ego is out of control. The acoustic guitar parts are awful, the over picked piezo sound on the Ademas ovation is a good exercise in how not to play an acoustic guitar.The orchestra tries in vain to keep up with YJM's bad timekeeping, but fails consistantly. The conductor needs to reherese his orchestra more for this type of event.This guy YJM needs to control his skill, he can be very good but this concert is just big Ego trip for him and it becomes a sad Joke on guitar fans.Thank goodness this ultra show-off shread metal style guitar is now old fashioned and no longer to be respected.Don't waste your money on this fiasco!Get Eric Johnson live from Austin and be amazed by comparison."
2,This isn't ery good,"Being a big time Yngwie fan I must say this doesn't show him very well. It was disappointing that he didn't seem to work very hard on his sound, performance or timing. This just seemed like he didn't rehearse and came out like his backing band was there ready to go but it was an Orchestra.He seemed poised at any moment to go fill tilt into his Shtick which is bothersome to his long time fans that think, scratch that.. ""know"" like everyone else it's a bit overdone now and wonders, why doesn't he go back into his Alcratraz/Rising force way's and keep it clean, tight yet bad ass? Unfortunately, in order to get the good, you have to put up with some bad. That's kinda how I see this dvd. There are parts of pure Yngiwe genius so I gave it an added star but overall he seems noisy and in over his head. Since he didn't write it (Dave Rosenthal) did. [...] and cannot write I'm not surprised but he could have put a little more into it."
3,guitar fiend,"Without some long, drawn out, pretentious review - those that know YM's work will not be disappointed in this disc. For those that are just discovering it, they'll wonder why they missed him. The audio and video quality of the disc is less then pristine but that may have been the pressing I recieved."
4,Great concert but sound quality lacking,"This is a great concert. Yngwie plays flawlessly and the orchestra adds a lot to the music. My only complaint is the sound quality. This is definitly not the best recording. The volume changes in the middle of songs, like the engineer changes mics or sources in mid-stream. There are places you can barely hear the guitar over the strings and horns. Beyond that, this is a must have for any Yngwie fan."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do not waste your money. I bought one of these cutters and it could not cut through my cigar with ease. I had to use so much force that it deformed my cigar. Looks very cheap with clear finger holes. Will be contacting seller to see what they can do about it.
3,"Cheap, but commensurate with the cost","Cheap cutter, but works. I rated it 3 only because to give it lower wouldn't be right because of what I paid for it and I didn't expect more."
4,"Good, but we still need more!","This CD is essential for any fan of the group. It has a different version of Car Song, and songs not easily found unless you collect the singles (""Gloria,"" for example.)But I still need more! Bootlegs, out-takes, rarities, the lot! This CD doesn't have all that rabid Elastica fans need. ""Cleopatra,"" ""Bitch Don't Work,"" ""The Unheard Music."" Surely ONE DAY these will all be available on one great collection so I can maybe rest at night knowing that I have heard all that's available.Justine---we still love you and your band. Help us out and continue to bask in your Elascticated glory."
4,Insightful and compelling,"What amazed me most about this book is the insight it gave me into my own grandparents and great-grandparents who, like the women interviewed in Ghorashi's book, fled countries that had become hostile and dangerous for them. Some of the stories they told me about their own experiences immigrating to America were echoed by the women in this book. More than 80 years separates my relatives and the women here, but the experiences remain similar.In addition, I found the book fascinating because of its look at people in the grips of revolutionary change. Wow! Their experiences with the revolution in Iran, the great hope they had for their country, and the ways in which those hopes were betrayed make for fascinating reading.For people interested in immigration policy, the comparison of the women's experiences in the US and the Netherlands is really insightful. It makes me proud of America's dysfunctional system. I never thought I would say that.I recommend this book."
3,had to purchase for school,the book was in good condition. nothing really to say about it. i didn't purchase to read in my spare time.
5,like it!!,It was what I was waiting for!!!!! It was brand new and the price was excellent!!!! I recommended it!! !
4,Very good and strong performance.,"This album is extremely entertaining and a return to the Sabina magic of old. His previous album ""Esta Boca es Mia"" was a relatively weak showing for him, causing me to wonder, is Joaquin getting over the hill? Not at all in this case, this album is filled with funny and humorous lyrics accompanied with great musicality and great sounding melodies. Joaquin is truly back in full form and audaciously affirms his way of thinking and seeing life (through his lyrics) and makes no apologies for it. Good for you Joaquin!"
2,Eh...bleh...,"The story itself isn't a very interesting or informative one. The author tries to end chapters with a catchy phrase that is cynical/humorous/meaningful, but they rarely come off well. Journalistic style, if you like reading a 250 page news article, then you'll love it, but if you have a hard enough time getting through the lead of a front page article in the ""New York Time,"" then don't bother."
3,"Book like politics: fun, leaves empty space in stomach","A well written book, exhaustive, sometimes boring. Lots of detail. Gives a very good look at politics, at how power, money, sinecure and ego all come together to get a bill passed. Shows that politics is 90% money and 10% intention. Lobbyists, senators and businessmen get together to divvy up the loot. Clinton is shown as a smart operator who attempts to play to the largest possible audience and still stay true to his beliefs/ethics/ideals."
2,CheckSoft,Product not enough retail sales compatable. Does not give ability to create deductions. Just too general. Don't like check design feature.
4,Fun story with an underlying message,I enjoyed Anima Twist. It is a fun and unique Sci-Fi / New Age story with an underlying message about the threat to Earth from our over population and over consumption.
1,Doesn't reach the undercoat,I would not recommend this comb for cats. It does not reach the undercoat but merely combs over the top coat. It's the equivalent of running your fingers through their fur. The teeth are too thick and rounded at the edge to grip hair. This comb went straight to the trash.
5,My big sisters of Ramiyah are the best,"Hi my name is Marvin Tucker, and im a 17 year black kid from Newport News, and Ramiyah are the best new group out anywhere in the world. There songs Here We Go & Just Stop are already one of my favorite songs of all time. These young ladies will keep your feet jamming, as they deliver the goods. It feels as if I connect right on point with Ramiyah, like they are my big sisters, giving me a ministry. Well I recommend this movie to people of all races, and even if you dont like gospel music. Because they are unique. So this is a review from Ramiyahs little brother.God Bless ya'll"
4,A great guide for students and working animators,"Hart breaks down the basics of modern character design in ways anyone could easily assimilate and recreate. This book came in handy when I taught animation to college students: being able to draw is only the first step to creating characters one can move about with ease and appeal. Hart's approach, and the examples he uses, are perfectly suited to the more modern techniques of Flash, but are also adaptable to classical animation. This book is a great find, offering practical, useful advice to those who intend to take animation seriously. I'd advise serious animation students to have it as part of their library, along with ""The Illusion of Life"", ""Your career in Animation"" by David Levy, and ""The animator's Survival Kit"" by Richard Williams."
4,Great for young budding artists,"Great for 8-15 age range. Artwork is fun and isn't intimidating to novice drawers. I'm a little out of the target age range and target skill set in my opinion, but even still I did pick up some clear, concise, and insightful tidbits on the style. If anyone is looking for drawing books for their kids, I'd keep Christopher Hart's name in mind."
5,Very Cartoon Cool,This book was very enjoyable and a great deal of fun. Christopher Hart really captured the essence of retro cartoon characters and obviously how to draw them. This provided great instruction and was very entertaining. My kids loved this book!!
5,Amaizing,Fast learn and easy Clear instructions and usefull tips. The great thing is the book it self gives a right push and allways is good to comeback to the basics anrd retrace what you learn
5,Awesome!,I has a lot of helpful information and awesome examples! I really enjoy the range of character types it talks about as well as the characteristics it mentions. It gives some pointers on slouching/posture of characters as well as shoulders on women. These are two topics that I had not given much thought of or read about elsewhere. It is really useful for those looking for help or references to retro or stylized characters. :)
5,most fun since childhood,"This book brings back pleasurable childhood memories. I had so much fun flipping thru pages packed with real cool cartoon figures I've always wanted to draw - the Perky family members of the frisky characters of my favorite TV shows.Hart, in his simple approach, guides the reader thru the technical steps while encouraging self-creativity. Easy steps to create simple yet sophisticated characters. This is the book I've been waiting for. Thank you Christopher Hart"
5,The Best New Anthology on American Transcendentalism,This is a thoughtful and resource-ful addition to anyone interested in 19th century Transcendentalism.It is a worthy successor to Perry Miller's book.
2,Boring book,"This book is boring and I would not have purchased it for ""leisure"" reading it is not a book for fun."
5,The Most Underrated Album of All Time!!!!!!,"You may not recignise any of tracks of this album. But beleive me, if your into hard rock and AC/DC then this is a must have album!Any AC/DC fan will tell you this is there most overlooked and underrated album of them all!Any freind ive played this album to has loved it and also asked why its not popular? Its because it didnt get any promoting! The album is a definite classic and imo is not just the most underrated AC/DC album, its possibly the worlds most underrated album!Every song is a great master peice and the rock n roll sound will blow your ears off! The re-issue probably could have done with a few of the songs that did not make the album back in 198somthing when it came out, but trust me, this album is a must listen to!!!!"
4,One of AC/DC's best albums!,"It took me years to fully appreciate Flick Of The Switch. I always liked the classic title track and the kickass House Is On Fire, but it took me a long time to appreciate other great tracks like Rising Power (cool chorus), Guns For Hire (great verse & chorus), Bedlam In Belgium (good riff), and Badlands. Angus' lead playing was not quite as good as on Back In Black but the riffs on this album kick ass! Brian's voice sounded as strong as ever too. I put this album just after Back In Black, Highway To Hell, and Dirty Deeds."
4,Dependable Hard Rock,"Flick of the Switch is the sorta record only true fans of the band still play. They had just come off massive success with their last three records when they made this no frills platter in 83 without their rising superstar producer Mutt Lange. Instead Malcom and Angus did the producing themselves. It's gotta stripped down and very raw vibe throughout. Lots of mid-tempo headbangers like Rising Power, Nervous Shakedown and Badlands with Phil Rudd always playin perfect. Title cut smokes. Great record to play guitar along with. AC/DC Rules!"
4,its worth the purchase,as other reviewers have stated this isn't ac/dc's best album BUT it still rocks hard and is good and consistent and still worth the purchase and even though it gets repetitive in spots it still has its gems like flick of the switch and nervous shakedown.its not conmplex its good straight foward raw rock and if that is what your looking for then this is what you want
5,The Real Deal!,"I read that this is Brian Johnson's favorite AC/DC album...and with one listen, it's easy to hear why. The man is ON FIRE on this album, screaming his head off like a madman. And the band plays likewise. This is the rawest, hardest, and just downright MEAN sounding album AC/DC ever did. It's just great, no nonsense rock & roll cranked up to 11. And it's more consistent than any of the big three Mutt Lang produced albums. This album is what AC/DC does best (along with albums like Powerage, Let There Be Rock and Ballbreaker). They were stripping down to their savage bones on Flick of the Switch; from the album's raw production, to the short and high energy songs, to the pencil sketch album cover. This is like AC/DC's Exile on Main St. The fact that classic rock radio never touches these songs, only makes them sound fresher.If you're a true AC/DC fan, this is an album you must own."
4,This One Grows On You,I find this AC/DC album to be the silent classic. You will never hear one of these songs on the radio and I'm not sure AC/DC plays any of these songs live but it's an excellent album.Albums like this make me realize just how great these guys are -where even an overlooked album and one that was probably considered a failure considering it followed their two biggest albums - is a kick ass record.Get it!
3,"great songs, bad producer","A worthy successor to Back in Black, with great songs, riffs, & energy. Standouts ""Gun for Hire"", ""Flick of the Switch"", ""Rising Power"". But its just missing something...the magic. The magic is a producer. The band fired Mutt and produced it themselves, and it shows. Listen to this in headphones and you hear how it lacks the stereo seperation, echo, headspace, and the nuiances that made ""Highway"", ""Black"", & ""For Those"" a classic trilogy. Mutt went on to ""Heartbeat City"", ""Pyromaina"" and Shania Twain; AC/DC fired their drummer, went to Simon (no talent) Wright, the drummer with no cymbals; the singer lost his voice; and the band never recovered their multi platinum luster. Sucks for the band, for the fans, and for a world that suffered the discovery of Shania Twain."
1,Terrible.,This is AC/DC on the downspiral they have continued since BIB. Most ac/dc albums have two good songs and 8-10 filler pieces of crap. This one is just total crap.
2,Grade D The Worst of the Johnson Era,"By the time this cd came out, AC/DC was metal champs, have 3 big selling cds, and what is probably there 3 best cds musically as well. This time there tried and true formula of power chords and guitar solo's over Johnsons skreeching scream, is annoying. And the lryics are getting dull. Not to say you can't find a decent song or two. Nervous Shakedown and Flick the Switch make for a couple good listens every year or two. Other than that, it's been there done that, at least 10 times, or what ever number this cd is. This time without the help of producer Mutt Lang, the songs have lost their shine, and made for a dull cd."
3,"Not on the top of their releases, but you know what you will get","You can always figure what you will get from this band...hard rock songs that showcase their bass, drums and guitar and this one is no different."
3,"Good product, poor quality control","My comb had one tooth that had not had the tip rounded. The end of the one tooth in the middle of the comb has a sharper, more square edge than all the other teeth that had rounded tips. I returned it and purchased a real Greyhound comb from Belgium. It's more expensive but I doubt it will be flawed. The Oster comb is a good product if the particular one considered is not defective -- it's a copy of a good Greyhound comb."
4,GOOD SOLID PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT THIS FUEL TANK TO GO ON MY 19' CENTER CONSOLE BOAT. IT IS A WELL BUILT, STURDY PRODUCT. I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE FUEL GAUGE BUILT INTO THE FILLER CAP. VERY EASY TO READ AND ACCURATE. I THINK THIS FUEL TANK IS PERFECT FOR MY APPLICATION AND SEEMS LIKE IT WILL LAST FOR QUITE A WHILE."
4,"Great Topper, if you like really soft stuff","this topper is very good in the fact that I like to sleep on soft things, like pillows, alot of blankets, toppers :). then I bought it, it kinda had a funny smell but it was just how it was made, the smell didn't go away yet but it isn't something that I lost sleep over, just throw a sheet and a blanket over it and go to sleep in the clouds :)....on problem I have with it, is that when I am sleeping, it like dents down where I am sleeping and it is kinda difficult to get out of bed, but the sleep I get is well worth this little hassle :)...I also have a pillow top bed that the topper goes on top of, so I think that might be the reason....I got this on sale also, so if it ever goes back on sale, don't wait, just buy it, and if you don't like it, just go back to this page when it isn't on sale and sell it to someone for what you bought it for and get your money back :)...but that is only if you don't like sleeping on a cloud *you troll*"
3,Memory foam looks ok not so sure about packing,Hi its actually not a review but a question to anyone who has purchased this product. It shipped by DHL but it came within a standarad Brown packing box with no warranty card or anything. The foam was wrapped in polythene along with the cover. I was expecting it in a box with the brand name and a warranty card like the same way you purchase from any store. I am not sure whether its a new one or a refurbished /old one. let me know if anyone got it the same way.
2,"Great for lawmen, not very useful for civilians.","I bought this video not knowing the exact contents beforehand. I was looking for extremely practicle self defense techniques similar to what the SEALs use. With a title like H2H I assumed it would be pure hand to hand fighting techniques. Do not be fooled ! This video is really only for a LAW ENFORCEMENT AUDIENCE. Perhaps if you live in a very dangerous neighborhood you may also find this useful. As luck would have it, I have studied the primary martial art that is featured here- Akijujitsu, so I was pretty familar with the moves. But unless you are in situations constantly where you have a gun pulled out or you need to subdue someone who does, you probably will be pretty bored."
1,Don't bother,"This thing is about 3 1/2"" tall, too short to be useful. Thanks to Amazon for making it look like its normal 5-6"". Weighs 1 lb NOT, about 4 oz."
3,Good but contains some bad advice,"I agree with the preceding reviewers but must add I found this book to be so general as to require supplementation by other books such as those by Ralph Mayer(somewhat out of date but still useful) or Robert Gottsegan. Ray Smith does offer some very dubious advice in parts of the text eg. he suggests that after priming your support with the traditional lead primer, you should sand it to smooth the surface. This is a TERRIBLE suggestion. Lead is very dangerous when inhaled--it only becomes inhalable when sanded or when used in pigment form. Sanding it is an absolute no-no.Ralph Mayer is a chemist, so his advice on safety issues is a lot more reliable than Mr Smith's. Of all three books, that by Gottsegan is probably the one I would recommend most as it is far more up to date than Smith's or Mayer's."
4,The Artist's Handbook,"This book has a great amount of information on various art mediums and techniques. With everything from in-depth pigment charts, prepping supports, drawing, acrylics, printmaking, and quick overviews in the back of the book on encaustic, vitreous enameling, vinyl and linoleum (which has some great photos of floor designs in children's hospitals, projects that are close to my heart), ceramic tiles, lighting and planting (landscape design).I learned some things I didn't know in the conservation and framing chapter on technical examination of paintings.I'm especially enjoying the chapters on oil painting, watercolor and gouache.My copy is now well highlighted in multiple colors to help me find the info I need fast as I'm creating and I like the fact that it's spiral bound, so I can lay it open flat to follow the instructions as I draw, paint, sculpt and more."
1,Not What I expected,"I had heard so much about this book from fellow artists and was excited to get it. But once I opened it up and started reading through it, I was greatly disappointed. Out of hundreds of pages, I could only use maybe 5 or 6 pages of it. The book is filled with all kinds of chemistry to make your own paints from pigments like the artists back in the day used to do. Not many of us have the finances or the time to that junk anymore. The book only had a small section about actual painting, which is what I do. The rest is full of details on how to make the supplies you would otherwise buy at artist supply stores, and many, many other forms of art techniques like lithograph, screen printing, ironwork, etc. I sent it back. Even though it was a good price, the $15 was not worth only 5 pages of usefulness to me."
3,ADDIT TO LAST REVIEW I SUBMITTED,"When recommending an alternative text in the last review I wrote of this book, I suggested Robert Gottsegan's book. His real name is Mark David Gottsegan. Apologies for this mistake."
2,Artist Handbook,"The book came in good time, was a little bit rough around the edges, but otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase."
4,For a soundtrack not bad,"I got this when it first came out. The highlight for me on thisis the song, The Awakening by a band called Voodoo X. Very, Very Cool Tune. Another stand out is Sword and Stone by Bonfire, Demon Bell by Dangerous Toys. The title track has some various artist on it. Definately a good cd if you like the 80's metal scene, as i do. But definately check out The Awakening by Voodoo X."
4,"Soft, enjoyable","We enjoyed watching two of our favoite stars (hey, we are both over 55) interact in an endearing, light-hearted movie. Yea, it was a little sappy, but what Christmas movie isn't?"
4,Gift - Well Received,"This was a gift that I had shipped directly to someone else. I initially got confirmation that it shipped, but when I emailed the company for a tracking number the company had trouble finding the order. It delivered fine, so all's well. For future reference, the coordination of order tracking could use some fine tuning."
1,What? Having an affair behind the back of a disabled person?,"I was shocked by this movie, and shocked that the people in it would even accept the script. Bad enough to cheat on a spouse who is well, disgusting to cheat on a spouse who is disabled, and living still. This movie and its script were in bad taste and discriminatory against disabled people and their dignity and right to carry on and have a spouse who is faithful through it all. One terrible night, I would call this."
5,Snow/cabin = love!,"Can it get any better than this one? I have watched this christmas movie for yrs and yrs since it first came out. I love rustic cabins-its got that! I love snow! Its got that! I love ""love stories""-its got that! Best of all I love happy endings-its got that! A real ""feel good"" christmas story."
4,Great Christmas movie!,A wonderful Christmas movie with 2 fabulous actors. We enjoyed it so much and it will be fun watching it in the years to come!
5,movie,This a wondrful family movie. We all loved it. They simply don't make good movies the whole family can watch anymore do they?
5,I rated this a 5 it's great,"I just seen this movie,anyone that seen James Garner before in movies well it's just differant for him to play this role i think.It's still a good movie and i would recommend it to anyone."
5,ONE SPECIAL NIGHT,"The kind of movie that the whole family can enjoy. No violence, no inappropriate language. Enjoyable. James Garner and Julie Andrews rekindle chemistry of a simpler time."
5,RV Driver,This was great the first time years ago on Hallmark and was even better the second time. Great love story
5,Feel good Christmas movie,"I enjoyed this movie. It's a good, clean, safe for family, Christmas movie that leaves you feeling good."
4,One special night can change your life.,This is a story about finding love even in difficult times and places. A lesson all ages can learn from. Help the person that you are being lead to help. Wonderful things can happen from the kindness you show to others.
4,One Special Night,"This sweet holiday movie by Hallmark features two legendary stars, James Garner and Julie Andrews, and their portrayal of roles does not let you down. Both are feisty and proper, but give hope that even ""older"" people can hope for love a second time around. This will be a holiday tradition movie for myself and my family."
4,Andrews and Garner are great together!,"I love Julie Andrews and James Garner. They are both such consumate actors, and the chemistry between them was wonderful in this. If you love romance, you will definitely want to add this one to your collection--and you can't beat the price...less than $6! Garner and Andrews are strangers that come together during a heavy snowstorm and end up spending the night together in a remote cabin. Their initial impressions of one another are softened as they get to know one another. Similar to the ""An Affair to Remember"" plot, they agree to meet, not at the Empire State Building, but at a local cafe for chocolate chip pancakes to celebrate their ""survival"" and continue their acquaintance. It would ruin your viewing pleasure to say more."
4,Great.,The perfect squeegee. I keep it in my car to wipe off the windows in the morning. It works well and it super light.
3,Just okay,"These step cleats are okay, for our application we would have preferred a heavier duty strip/cleat. It is the draw back from online ordering versus seeing the product before you buy. We needed to apply the strips so sending them back and finding others was out of the question-time wise. We could not even find them locally - another plus for Amazon-period!"
5,Nice scope,These are nice scopes. I already had the 3-9x50 for my Airforce Talon SS air rifle and got this one for my Ruger 10/22. I went with the 40mm because i wanted to use lower scope rings.
5,This is the TRUTH about men,"Do you find yourself always making up excuses about a guy who never calls you when he says he will? Or maybe that guy is really ""busy"" and just can't make the time for a simple phone call or visit to you? There are a million excuses that women make up about men, and this book will tell all of them. I found myself making up half of those excuses about men. Ever since I read this book, I found a wonderful guy who cares about me and makes the effort to see me. Women deserve the best, so read this book! It will help you get on the fast track to finding the one special guy for you!"
3,"Good, but not great","What I had hoped would offer never before revealed secrets about the opposite sex, turned out to be what I knew all along; people are ultimately where they want to be, and if someone wants to talk to you they'll call. This book got a lot of hype that frankly, I feel is undeserved. Women will little to no common sense will find it very revealing, for the rest of us it will be light reading that elicits a yawn or two."
3,3 Star Max the book doesn't tell it all,"There's not a whole lot of relationship advice in this book. There are some helpful passages about guys games that they play, and the book is funny, like the show Sex in the City, but it really does not give any in depth answers. This is NOT a serious relationship book. It is a fun to read book, but if you want more in depth answers in relationships, this book just doesn't have them."
3,How to get an Alpha male.,That's the real message. There's a lot of helpful advice and common sense about the gender gap in this book but its premise has one big flaw: some times men are shy or self conscious.
4,funny,"this book does not give all the scenerios that we women experience on a day by day basis but some of the stuff that was shared by the authors are humorous. a lot of it is denial by the women.when it all comes down to it, if a guy is into you, he would find the time to call and talk to you. when he loses interest and runs away, he does not want to catch his tail between his legs so therefore, it just means he's just not into you.very interesting and very entertaining."
4,Hillarious,"Totally funny and entertaining....Although, I do take issue with the ""if he doesnt call you every second of every day expressing his undying love and devotion...blah blah blah...""Hey girls, if he's busy, he's busy. It's called ""work"". Now, if he doesnt call you for several days, then take the advice of the authors.Kind of hard on us guys. I know that there are legit reasons that relationships don't work out, and (surprise) it isnt ALWAYS the guys fault.The same advice goes for girls."
4,If I'd only...,"If I'd only read this book two years ago, I could have saved myself the upcoming divorce. Yeah, he asked me to marry him, but we now see how that turned out. I'm going to keep this book with me at all times...to remind me what NOT to do again."
1,Tripe,"Offensively Rules-y and sexist, this book was written by comedians as a joke and readers shouldn't be treating it as actual romantic advice. Just because Oprah had a show on it doesn't make it brilliant.Even the episode of Sex & the City that this is based on concluded that relationships are not this simple. Since when are men not allowed to be shy, and women not allowed to ask them out? 1950?"
3,Are all men like Greg?,"This book is great for those women who never seem to get the hint, but overall, I think it makes too many generalizations about men. The book assumes that all men are confident enough to ask or not-ask out all the women they want. The men are also bold enough to call all the shots in the relationship and the courtship phase. Being a woman, I believe this type of logic when I read it, but since reading it, I have seen more and more examples to the contrary. I have had several close male friends over the years, and they obsess about when to call a woman, when to ask her out, and all other aspects of the dating rituals. If you doubt this, there are many movies out about insecure men, written by insecure men. Granted, women are attracted to confidence, but it doesn't seem as cut and dry as Greg implies."
1,What a waste of time!,If this jerk is a the typical male then no wonder women choose to be alone! Seem's more like he wrote the most offensive material he could to sell a book to make a lot of money. I couldn't find anything at all accurate or intereseting in here. If women take this book serious it would be a huge mistake. This clown has no idea what he is talking about!Even Amazon ask's if the reviewer is over 13. Too bad they don't apply the same scrutiny to their author's!
4,If it was only this simple.,"I actually enjoyed reading it, matter of fact I bought it for a couple of my friends for Christmas. I dont think they liked it as much as me. I think the women that have a hard time in this area might find the book too offensive because the writer goes right to the core of the problem and does not sugar coat it. He tells it like it is and the truth hurts especially if you know you are one of these women that fit the stereo-type. Alot of us stay in denial especially when we really want it to work.... but the signs are very clear when 'He's Just Not That Into You!'"
1,Dangerous,"The hype surrounding this book is amazing. This, apparently, has become the book of ""the hour"".I picked it up from our local library because I bought into the hype and thought it would be something similar to Sex and the City.BIG MISTAKE.This book is DANGEROUS because it promotes the idea of a one size fits all. Therefore, every guy and every girl and every relationship should be identical. What is that about?This book tells you that you should NEVER consider any kind of circumstances at all. If he doesn't do this, its because he is not into you AND NO EXCUSES. That's crap. If only life were THAT simple.I hate people like these authors or like Dr. Phil. They make everything so black and white. I would love to spend some time in their lives to see just how black and white their lives really are.I have been on both sides of the fence (when the guy was into me and when he wasn't) and let me tell ya, it just ain't that simple.This book is simply dangerous."
1,PUT IT BACK ON THE SHELF! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,"SOME MALE CHAUVENIST PIG OBVIOUSLY WROTE THIS BOOK. HERE'S A TIP.IF THERE ISN'T OBVIOUS FIRST CHEMISTRY THEN WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO WALK AWAY ON BOTH SIDES?IF THERE IS...LET HIM DO ALL THE CALLING. NEVER FORGET YOU ARE THE TREASURE AND LET HIM DO THE HUNTING. I PROMISE, EVENTUALLY HE WILL CALL YOU. MEN ALWAYS WANT WHAT THEY CAN'T HAVE OR WHAT THEY THINK THEY CAN'T HAVE!AGAIN IF THERE IS INITIAL CHEMISTRY ON BOTH SIDES - THE WOMAN HAS ALL THE POWER - DO NOT GIVE UP.IF HE CRAWLS INTO HIS CAVE THEN LET HIM STAY THERE - WHEN HE COMES OUT - HE'LL CALL AND CALL AND CALL AND IF HE'S JUST LUCKY ENOUGH HE MAY GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN.TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS - FROM REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE - HAVING BEEN ENGAGED SEVEN TIMES INSIDE OF THE FIRST 3 MONTHS. GETTING OUR MAN IS WHAT WE WERE BORN TO DO!"
2,life is gray and this book is tritely black and white!,"While I think this book is witty, and perhaps even helpful to women with unusually low self esteem, Greg's so-called wisdom is simplistic to a fault. If Sex & The City taught one thing it's that relationships are complex and take time. By urging women to keep up their defenses so high, this book kills love before it even has a chance to start."
1,Objectification anyone?,The grammatical structure of title alone exemplifies The Centerfold Syndrome as written by Gary Brooks. Read it ladies. 'nuff said.
3,Book: he's just not that into you...,"I thought the book was crap, but the service was excellent and the book arrived very quickly. I suppose the book would be OK for young women just starting out in the dating scene, but for a 'mature' woman like me, it was just a rehash of stuff I already knew. Most of the losers he described were just abusers and users and a woman with self-esteem would avoid them. A book on self-esteem would be of more use, I think."
4,Good Advice,"Good advice for women attracted to men who are not attracted to them, using them for sex, or are just plain losers. But do women really need to hear it repeated as many times as it was in this book?"
3,Mostly good story,"This ""No-Excuse Truth to Understanding Guys"" explains a variety of relationship issues, such as guys not calling, disappearing, cheating, etc. The explanation is universally that if the guy really wanted to be with you, he would not be acting in this way. And no amount of waiting/changing/loving/etc will change that fundamental flaw in your relationship (or non relationship).Quote: ""I know it's nice to have companionship and wake up with somebody that you really like, but that's what pets are for. Pets are God's way of saying, ""Don't lower the bar because you're lonely.""I found this book to be more-or-less entertaining, although occasionally disheartening (the things women put themselves through!) Although I could not relate to a lot of the conflicted situations related in the stories. However, taken as extremes for the sake of proven a point (which I am sure are sometimes valid), I found them to be entertaining."
3,It is mean!,Making him look bad is not necessarily making you feel better...It is a book that brings sadness and stress. I am the tpye of person who prefer a soft way...so it is not the right book for me...
3,"Sugar Read, but True!","This is not something I usually would read but that's part of self-help isn't it? I must say, I quite enjoyed it!They put certain things that are too obvious yet we often miss in a transparent and aggressive manner. I was being slapped the entire time as I read it.I now know why."
3,OK OK I get it,"I liked the concept of the book and the general message...""He may just not be that into you"". A decent read which gives good insight however I think I got more from the earlier chapters than those which followed. After a while it was like ""I get the picture already."" Maybe if the style had been varied after a few chapters... Anyway ... all in all...an easy read and worthwhile especially if you need to drive that point home to yourself...Thanks for the heads up Greg!!"
4,Alarmingly Accurate,Although this book may seem a bit blunt at times it gets to the point and really highlights some things dating women need to realize. I liked the fact that it was from both a man and woman's point of view.
2,Sorry!,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" was a little too harsh for my liking. When reading it, I felt even though it was full of little signs & signals to watch for in relationship; the way the book was written made the average woman feel ignorant for not seeing these things on her own. I much preferred Ian Kerner's book ""YOU'RE NOT THAT INTO HIM EITHER"". The author takes many different approaches to identify what kind of man you are actually dating, describes dating fatigue, looks at the definition of booty call, friends with benefits, hookup, No strings attached, etc. This book uses a ""self-help"" approach, instead of making the reader feel ignorant for not seeing these facts without reading a book about them.I know this is a very popular and well read book. It has also had a lot of celebrity hype and media attention, sorry; it just didn't do it for me!"
5,great book,I love this book i actually read my sisters first and decided to get one of my own so i can lend it to others :)
5,An eye opener...,Every woman needs to read this book before they get married. Trust me....unless you are a lesbian. I do believe it is possible to marry someone who is just not into you. But once you are married you can't just break it off....
5,Simply Powerful,"As a Soulmate Coach and author of Manifesting Your Soulmate,I love this book.The authors have condensed all the possible answers to so many dating questions intoone simple all encompassing phrase: ""He's just not that into you."" The phrasesolves so many possible problems that women can encounter with unsuitable dates.If a woman encounters any thing from a guy who is uncommitted todistant to negligent, she doesn't have to wrack her brains about whatshe did, could have done, or possibly should have done to get himto treat her better.She can just admit early on that he's just not that into her and move onto someone else who appreciates who she is and wants to treat her in a manner thatshe'd prefer."
3,Nice read,"This ""No-Excuse Truth to Understanding Guys"" explains a variety of relationship issues, such as guys not calling, disappearing, cheating, etc. The explanation is universally that if the guy really wanted to be with you, he would not be acting in this way. And no amount of waiting/changing/loving/etc will change that fundamental flaw in your relationship (or non relationship).Quote: ""I know it's nice to have companionship and wake up with somebody that you really like, but that's what pets are for. Pets are God's way of saying, ""Don't lower the bar because you're lonely.""I found this book to be more-or-less entertaining, although occassionally disheartening (the things women put themselves through!) Although I could not relate to a lot of the conflicted situations related in the stories. However, taken as extremes for the sake of proven a point (which I am sure are sometimes valid), I found them to be entertaining."
4,Great Book if You are Ready for Reality,"Let's face it - waiting for the phone to ring is a BIG waste of time. This book is a great reminder that I am worth more than just hanging out or settling for an occasional e mail! I want my man to TAKE me out, treat me with respect and show a genuine interest in ME. I plan to keep this book in a handy place for reference for those times when my heart wants to take over and obscures what I really need to be seeing. Yeah, reality really stinks but it sure is better to face the truth than to waste a lot of time hoping that things will change.This book is presented in a lighthearted and sometimes hilarious way while serving as a real eye opener. I would definitely recommend it to any gal who finds herself in the dating pool and to the guys out there who might want to know what NOT to do."
2,Maybe you should have listened to your Mom!!!,"I decided to read this book after hearing about it from friends and family. I just wanted to see what all the hype was about. Okay, the book is funny, but there is nothing new here. It's the same advice and information that my mom used to give to me when I first started dating. Maybe this book would have been useful if I was 13 and not 30."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read. Really bad advice!,"I don't know how this person conducted his research but the book is clearly a farce, it amusing (especially for women) and makes a funny gift."
1,read the product description,"Ok, men are simple. Mixed messages mean that ""they're just not that into you."" Ok, 176 pages later... the same thing. Read the product description. Save yourself some time. Do or read something productive (maybe then men will actually be into you and you won't need a book to decipher your inadequacy and failure) It sums it up nicely. Or, God forbid, watch the ""Sex in the City"" Episode. Cary Bradshaw probably types it on her laptop in the form of a horribly trite and insipid rhetorical question. She's a writer!!! It's cute... Buy this book with The Da Vinci Code and The South Beach Diet if you are completely retarded."
2,Meh!,"So, I read this on the recommendation of a few good friends who said that, even if I didn't necessarily need the self-help side of it, I would still find it amusing.I didn't.It's all so obvious and so done to death. I couldn't even get through it all."
4,"Good overall, with one key flaw","This book contains some common sense advice that's presented in a humorous way.My only problem with it is that the book seems to be geared toward Manhattan city types who regularly frequent bars and clubs. A ""Sex and the City"" atmosphere is assumed, but the dating scene across America does in fact differ.In particular, many parts of this book would be inapplicable to people with strong religious faith or people who don't believe in jumping in the sack on the third date."
4,HE'S JUST NOT INTO YOU - REVIEW,"I purchased this as a gift, but my daughter says it is funny and well worth it."
4,Enjoyable,"At first I thought that a guy could read this book and add an S to He and you'd have the guys version. After reading it, I realized I was wrong. He's Just not that into you is a humerous book and a joy to read, while still making a point. A must for men and women to read."
5,Insightful!!!,I bought this book not for me but for my girls that need a Clue. I'm a Happily Married woman so my friends always come to be for advice. This is a Great Book it tells the truth so if your not willing to accept the truth then this book is not for you. But if you can take the truth about men and how they Really are then buy this book but not only read it take what it has to say and use it.
1,never received this item or a refund,"I never received this item. I never received a refund because I didn't get it. In fact, my correspondences were ignored.I love Greg Behrend but I don't love that neither the seller or Amazon acknowledged my inquiries as to why I never received this item."
2,what was all the hype for?,"bla bla bla. This stuff was so obvious! I mean, if he doesn't call you back then he's not into you. Do you really need a book to tell you that?? Phleease."
2,he doesnt want you,"The cover of this book makes the book look very interesting, it it is an easy read but this book is not a page turner.This book try to expose mens feelings which really does not work. Also this book is not for a man to read because he will end up putting it down. This is only one side and basically does not give men leeway."
1,No woman in her right mind would enjoy this book.,"Aside from the half hearted attempts by the author to make the reader feel mediocre about their physical appearance, this book is a great way to ruin a woman's self confidence. The authors produce a few valid points, but overall I felt they were saying, ""Give up on men because none of them like you."" I feel bad for the young, impressionable minds who read this book and have their self-esteem and confidence detroyed."
4,This book is funny,"While this book is cover to cover common sense, we've all known girlfriends with just too little of it when it comes to a relationship.The book is a little repetative but very funny and full of situations you may be familiar with (hopefully through girlfriends, not your own experiences).I read it in one sitting at the library. A very quick and funny read."
3,More suitable to a teenager...?,"This book is good, but IMHO it's more suitable to teenagers who start dating. I do not say that women don't need this, we may do, but most of us have been familiar with the cases mentioned (and the advice given). Greg and Liz's humorous style in writing is fun anyway (as if they could read my mind). This book is perfect to motivate people whose a bad relationship and don't know how to leave it. Also good to help us checking our (should be) good relationship... We, women, deserve to be appreciated, and if there are men who don't follow the rules, why do we have to keep them around? :)"
5,All women should read this book!,"I found this book very humorous and uplifting. The author offers advice that is not easy to hear. However, it definitely rings true. I totally enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any woman."
5,GREAT BOOK,"This book is sort of ""common sense"" but I got insightful info out of it nonetheless. I purchased 2 extra copies for my friends."
3,Amusing book...,"This book was taken out of an episode of Sex and the City, but that's not the reason why I gave it a whirl. This magazine-like book is an attempt to open the eyes of all deluded single women out there who find every excuse in the book to justify men's reasons for not calling them or for avoiding them when the simple answer all along is... you've guessed it! They are just not that into them. This book will facilitate things for us single gals, right? Wrong! We will always torture ourselves by overanalyzing things. And there are exceptions to every rule, and I am the walking proof of that. The book does discuss possible exceptions to that strong piece of advice. Some of those letters made me laugh. I marvel at the way we women analyze everything. Anyway, this was a fun, no-fuss book to read. I didn't take it seriously and neither should you. I did enjoy the bold honesty though."
5,I wish I knew this line 20 years ago.......,"Even though I'm happily married, I had to read this book. I made so many of the stupid excuses they point out in the book during my single years. What a waste! The wisdom here would have saved me years of agitation. I just might have met the man that was into me sooner."
1,What a waste,"I won't bother giving the premise of the book as everyone seems to know about it.All I will say is that I am really mad at myself for having falling for the hype. I thought this would be a fun book to read.Instead, it seems to make a mockery of relationships and sends the message that all relationships should be the same. I agree with the previous reviewer who said this book is dangerous."
1,Nothing in life is this simple,"I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore and did see the Oprah episode. I think that this book is far too simplistic and overlooks the fact that everyone is different and that it is impossible to see into someone's mind and know what he or she is thinking. And how dull to constantly have to evaluate your relationships with other people and judge them against someone else's guidelines!The whole self-help trend, particularly in terms of dating books, just feels really creepy and controlling."
4,Truthful book,"Love the book and Greg's humor. There are some adult themes and foul language. If you push those aside, it is a great book in learning about men and how they will pursue when they are into women."
5,Great Book for a Confidence Boost and a Pick Me Up,"I bought this book about a month ago after having it on my ""want list"" for a while. I have only skimmed through it a couple times, but I found it to be a great pick me up. It reminds me not to settle for anything (any guy) less than I deserve. If you are like me and have dated the bad boys who don't really put much effort into the relationship but still string you along, this book is a great to give you a wake up call. I love it. It is a must for any woman's library."
3,Interesting,"Man, this book was interesting. I honestly can say that I think back to a past relationship in college and think Wow, I was stupid. I wish I could have saw the signs then that ""he just wasn't into me"" and could kick yourself for falling into the trap.However, I do reccommend The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene. This opened my eyes to the games people play in relationships."
1,lame,i have read about 1/4 or more into it and lost interest. it makes girls look stupid and i don't like the way it's written - dear abby format. it's lame and a waste of money. i wish i could return it.
1,What about us?,"Is there a corollary to this book of profound fiction? I rather doubt it. A book titled ""She's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Gals"" would undoubtly be too simplistic. What's to understand? The book would consist of one blank page. Whoopie! ""Lou"""
5,HILARIOUS AND HONEST!,"I HIGHLY recommend this book! It is hilarious, fun to read...and it's the truth!!!"
5,Fantastic Seller!,"This Seller shipped this item super fast and the book was in fantastic condition. I would definitely buy from this Seller again in the future.LianneC...Las Vegas, NV"
2,Not what I thought,Expected book to be story line or play write of movie. Was just the orginal book.
1,Not what I expected.,I expected a story similar to the movie. It is not! Just a bunch of quotes from the authors of the book. Very disppointing!
2,We already know these things,"I purchased this book due to all of the rave reviews it was given. However, I am a little disappointed. Once I was half way into the book, I began to realize that the book was only explaining what us ladies already know. We have been through so much when it comes to dating/relationships, that I think we all can write a book like this. In conclusion, I missed my calling.....I could've wrote this book myself!!!!!!Stephanie in Indiana"
3,The Book,I couldn't put this book down. These two authors talk about what to look out for in a relationship on the man's part. WHat he says or does usually means something else. Tons of women write letters telling Greg or Liz about there men and what they should do. Greg always had soemthing to say. I think a lot of these women are dumb for thinking they should stay with a guy after he has cheated and abused them. I recommend this book to anybody in a relationship or not becuase it shows you flaws and problems in a relationship.
4,Sometimes You Just Need a Third Party to Open Your Eyes,"I've never read a self help book before but heard about this lighthearted book at the perfect time in my life. Although I believe that the information in this book is true I don't think a person should dump a guy for just one of the examples (unless he's cheating on you or is married). Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide whats going on in their relationships. This book turned out to be the confirmation I needed that I was wasting my time on a guy I thought would eventually get over his commitment issues. Take the advice with a grain of salt and it will save you a lot of heartache in the long-run, but make sure you judge each relationship based on the facts not what some book says."
5,"Greg, I get it!","I am not cynical. I consider myself a happy-go-lucky person that looks for the best in others. Before reading this book, I thrived on making excuses for men who at the end of the day, just weren't as interested in me as I was in them. Is it true that every man that didn't contact me after I met them wasn't interested? Probably not, but that's not the point; why should I waste time thinking about someone who is kinda-sorta interested, when I can ignore them and focus on the calls from the genuinely interested? The authors of ""He's Just Not That Into You"" are 100% correct about one thing: obeying the rules of this book is liberating. I will never again care about a man that doesn't call, or doesn't call back. Their loss, not mine."
2,In a nutshell:,"On the one hand...Women (and men) need to keep ego from blocking out reality, stop trying to force solutions, and keep moving toward what they want and deserve. (Yes)But on the other hand....* Women should never, under any circumstances whatsoever, call a man or ask him out. Or show any assertiveness at all. Or take his number. Or email him. Or take the initiative, ever. (Back into that cave, Wilma Flintstone!)"
2,what's all the hype about?,"I didn't learn a thing about ""understanding guys"" from this book. It is lacking in the area of communication and teaching how to get past the facads. This book portrays men in a single category, the kind that are unavailable and dishonest game players to begin with. I agree with a reviewer below, not every guy is the same, and not every woman is the same either. I was more disappointed in this book than I thought I would be. It's over hyped and doesn't deliver."
2,Not for the currently brokenhearted,"This might be a good book if you're confused about why that guy you met 2 weeks ago hasn't called you like he said he would, or why your crush doesn't ever look your way... But this is NOT a book I'd recommend reading after you've been dumped by a guy and you're completely heartbroken. While it might give you a reality-check in other situations, it actually made me feel worse about the breakup, because it basically told me how much my ex-boyfriend doesn't want me and won't ever speak to me again. It might be the truth, but it's not what a girl wants to hear after being dumped! For the brokenhearted women out there, choose ""It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken"" (Behrendt) instead - MUCH better advice that makes you feel good about yourself and the situation at hand."
2,"Good for humor, not for understanding men","Greg Behrendt may be one of those guys who hates having women call him, but he and his co-writer should be ashamed for writing an entire book based on a stereotype. Most guys do NOT mind being called for a date, especially by women they gave their number to for that purpose!Go ahead and get this book if you're a fan of SATC, but don't assume the advice will apply to more than a relative handful of men. If you're meeting guys who seem like the ones described here, you need to start looking somewhere else."
1,"Unfortunately, they don't let you give zero stars","I know this book has a billion reviews but I thought I'd do my part to add to the one star reviews as a public service, especially since the movie is coming out. Mind you, one star only because you can't choose zero.My friend instructed me to borrow her copy of this book. At the time I was a self conscious and lonely single woman and thought it might help me learn what I'm doing wrong. Even though I was already annoyed and insulted at the title, I read it.Many have made good points so I won't be a broken record. I just want to share that I met a guy a couple years ago. While he did email me first, he was very slow to respond to me after that. If I listened to this dumb book I wouldn't be married to this wonderful but very shy guy who constantly tells me how lucky he feels to be with me.I guess in Gregg's world men aren't allowed to be shy, they all have to be giant A--holes like him."
3,Ha,"Why pay $20 for the book when the title says it all? Have you ever ""not called"" or ""blew off"" a guy you really, really liked because you were scared/busy/insecure/intimidated?? Probably not.I don't understand why most women are constantly looking to be reassured. Why do you think you are so insecure in the first place? Is it because you are constantly sizing yourself up to other people? Is it because spend all your time putting on makeup instead of reading books?I have a friend who I want to buy this book for, but it would probably get thrown back in my face. Her problem - she can't handle rejection. But the reason guys reject her is because she is too insecure and neurotic to just go with the flow, act natural and be herself. It's an endless cycle, ladies.Anyway, if your reading this review, I'm glad I'm not you."
3,We Always Want To Be Into Women,"I think Jeff Foxworthy summed it up when he said, ""all men want to do is drink beer and see nekkid women"". Men really aren't that complicated to understand."
2,Don't take this to heart ladies,"I found this book to be horrifying to any woman who's wondering whether or not a guy is into you. First of all it's written by a married man who has to tell you throughout the book how wonderful you are after he says something to push you to tears. The second half is written by a single woman. Not someone I feel comfortable taking advice from if you're looking to find a man to settle down with. What good is her advice if she can't land a man?I read ""Be Honest, You're Not Really That Into Him"" and found that to be of much more tremendous help. We don't need to hear why men aren't into us, we need to learn what we're doing wrong. Skip this book and read the suggested one or if you've already read this and feel like total crap, read the later title and you'll feel better in an instant."
5,truly empowering....,"This is the best book for women who have a hard time keeping that ""jerk"" in perspective. The more excuses you make for his behavior the less likely it is that he's the ""one."" Read it--it's so true! After reading it, I quit making excuses and said, ""you're just not that into me. Go away!"" And, now I have the one that is into me. I didn't miss him cuz I was wasting time with ""Mr. Codswallup"" over there."
4,HOLD OUT FOR THE MENSCH...HE'S WORTH THE WAIT,"Simply put.....I couldn't agree more with the premise of this book. Through my work as The Love Coach, I have seen so many women waste time making excuses for men who have short-changed them on the relationship front. They date almost with blinders on because they want to remain hopeful, yet there are red flags along the way that they might have picked up if they were clued in.The point is....don't waste time with someone who isn't into you...and this book makes that point over 'n over again, and it's a lesson worth learning, so you can go on and meet the ""mensch"" who is deserving of you. (Mensch is a decent, responsible person.)"
5,Must Read for all Women,"This book has transformed my relationship outlook. Very charming, heartfelt, and a quick, funny read. Coming off a tortuous series of break ups, I went a little self-help, relationship book-crazy trying to figure out why I couldn't seem to make it work with anyone. I cannot believe how simple it is -- they just weren't that into me! Eureka! Nothing to figure out, no one to blame, no self-esteem issues, no crappy ""rules"" to follow or games to play. He's just not that into you, and you deserve better! This is truly the best relationship book out there, ladies."
1,A marketing gimmick,"If you cannot see how the authors of this book are playing with your heads, then the book is targeted at you.Many men in the dating game treat dating as just that, a game. Women who fall for the good looking trash driving posh cars to hide their insecurities are not ""thinking clearly"" to begin with. The players will continue to play and everything in the book describes those players.However, a significant number of men aren't players. There are so many genuine and this book does not do any justice to them.This book tells you what you want to hear to feel good. Of course you will like the book, just as you will like a massage (or any kind of attention that pampers you). If you can't see behind the screen, you deserve to be brainwashed and lose the best men out there."
1,Just Not That Into This Book,"I was really disappointed with this book. It is definitely not worth buying in hardcover. I searched for this book, and once I finally found it I was bummed. Girls know everything in this book, but as the book says, they keep questioning themselves. Woman are emotional. Woman get attached. This book isn't going to make me any stronger than I already am when a guy doesn't call me back. Instead of wasting your time reading this book, get out there and meet a guy who'll be just that into you."
1,annoying,"Frankly I just did not enjoy this book and wish I hadn't spend 12 dollars on it. I wanted to punch the author in the face from the get-go. While I appreciate the intention of the book, the author is condescending and patronizing towards women [""at 0400 (that's 4 am, ladies!)""] Just irritated me."
1,I'm just not that into it.,"It's pages and pages of whining and excuses. What a waste of time. Never even finish this book. I don't get what the hype is about. The movie was excellent, this book is the complete opposite. I guess I'm not much of a self-help book. I much rather The MANual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think,Date,and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top by Steve Santagati. Much better than this pity party book."
5,Gets the point across,This book definitely gets the point across to women. He's just not that into you is now implanted into my brain. I've learned all the signs and have now begun to nip things in the bud. I'm not usually into self-help books but this one was ok. And it was cute ad funny too. You can definitely related to a lot of the stories in there.
4,Try The Rules for a grown-up version of this book,"There is a chapter in The Rules II called ""If he doesn't call, he's not that interested. Period!"" Sound familiar? Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider have been trying to get women to understand this since 1995. If you've been afraid to read The Rules because you don't like the way it sounds, you ""don't want to play games,"" you think it's old-fashioned, or whatever other excuses you have, try it. If you like this book, you will like The Rules. However, if you need trendy lingo and hip sayings to believe that men who are really interested will pursue you, then please, read this book forty times."
3,Overpriced and mismarketed,"First of all, I did not like this book at all. It based on one mans opinions and I would rather read a book on the same topic with real psych facts rather than opinions.It is also marketed at the Sex and the City watchers when the books seems to be more suited for a younger audience. If I was still 16 I may have liked this book.The book itself costs, depending upon where you purchase it, between 15 - 20 dollars. When I buy a book in that price range I expect to be reading it for a few days. It took me no more than an hour to read the entire book! I think this book is a complete waste of time."
3,He's just not that into you,"The book was good, but it told you why to dump the man, but not how to deal afterwards or how to handle the next man that shows he just may not be that into you, I mean, really, you dump one and another comes along, you find out after a week or so, but how do you handle them before that week comes about? Hope you understand what I'm trying to say?"
4,Missing Some Info,"I enjoyed this book, but I thought it focused to much on what NOT to do...okay, then, tell us what we SHOULD DO (doing nothing is not an option for most of us). I thought that ""Why Men Love Bitches"" was more informative in that respect. There was more hands on advice about what you can do if you have this problem in dating. But if you get tired of reading all these books about how to date, another book I really enjoyed, which was just pure fun for women is ""Bedtime Stories For Women"" by Nancy Madore. The sexual fairy tales in her book are definitely more fun than the dates I have been on lately."
2,"You know, I really wanted to like it....","Ok. I'll admit it...the guy is funny, and he has written a funny book. But, halfway through, in the midst of my laughter, I realized something: These are real women I am laughing at! This book is Mr. Behrendt's nice way of calling all of us women naive and silly, and he is going to be the one profiting from our supposed inability to ""understand the male psyche""! Ladies, I can sum it up in one sentence: If you don't feel like the guy is crazy about you, and you spend hours analyzing every decision he makes (and making your friends do the same),then you probably deserve better. If you think you deserve flowers and romance and marriage, and he's not willing to offer it---go find a great guy that will. Yes, it is a funny book, but if you are looking for sound relationship advice, I just gave it to you for free."
2,I am not that into it...,"I have yet to find a relationship book that doesn't sugarcoat the truths. It will be difficult, because those truths are ugly. To every situation this book offers a comforting answer that ""he is not into you"", while it doesnt anwer the most burning question ""why"" and all these women happily continue to make the same mistake again. A few times this book had shining moments, like that guys would be glad to destroy ""friendship"" for sex, but they are so shy they almost go unnoticed. You will never learn anything useful from this."
1,great money making scam A BOOK,This book was so incredibly stupid I can't believe this. Ladies if u need to know from a book he is not into u STOP DATING NOW! !!!!
1,Common Sense!,"This book is great for gullible women who believe that they really need advice from an ""expert"" to realize that a man isn't that into her. I couldn't even make it through the entire book simply because I got tired of all the excuses made by these dillusional women for men who really aren't even worth it. This book is a generalization stating that all men are the same, when they are not. Each situation is different, and all it takes to figure out that a man is not that into you is a little common sense. Anyone who feels they actually need advice from this complete stranger, obviously needs a book on common sense."
4,Best book ever!,"This is truely a great book. Very easy read and very funny, as well as enlightening. This book is for anyone that has let a guy make excuses for his awful behavior. It also teaches you to appreciate the guys that do treat you the way you deserve. If you are dating... read this book. It will change your life."
3,Discussing The Obvious.,Many instances described in the book are the obvious for the experienced lover. I believe the book is more geared for the in-experienced lover for having a serious relationship with the opposite sex. It's kind of boring for the experienced one. Just my opinion....?
4,Versatile,"About 4 years ago, a friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday.I'm a gay man and had been in a couple one-way relationships in the previous years. My friend was tired of hearing me pine after men who were just not that into me.I enjoyed the read . . . applied it to my love life. No boyfriend right now, but I FEEL much better. Empowered.BUT, the biggest positive aspect of this book that I have taken from reading it was not even (at least to my knowledge) intentional on the part of the authors. I have taken the advice of ""He's Just Not That Into You"" and applied it to my FRIENDSHIPS, and THAT is what has changed my life much more (and for the better).I'm no longer a friend who does all the calling, planning, caring, etc. If you're my friend, you'll share those responsibilities. Ironically, the friend who gave me the book fell into the ""he's just not that into me"" category, but I'll always be grateful for him introducing me to the idea."
1,Less Guess Work for Understanding Guys,"It is so simple now to avoid wasting your time on someone who is not into you...You could say...let the bee come to the flower...or look for someone who will swim through shark infested waters to bring you a lemonade....My high school sweetheart is one of those ""guys""...Now I know what I want, and I am worth it..."
1,how cynical can we be?,"i read the first 3 pages of this book and concluded that this guy's an idiot. he's obnoxious and sarcastic. his writing style is such that you wish he were talking to you so you could slap him because it's so inconsiderate! the book starts with these women writing him sincere questions, and since he doesn't really know what he's talking about, he just makes fun of them, and does so in an unfunny way. i mean, he could have made the book humorous, but the sarcasm kills it. don't waste your time with this. if you want a real read, with real humor, read sex and the city."
2,Title says it all,"Read the title, read the excerpt, skip buying the book unless you have money to burn. If you really must read it, get it from the library."
4,Urban Secrets,You may not like what you read. But the authors make a lot of sense. I bought this for 2 girlfriends -- and they should read it carefully.
1,Double-hoop earrings + carefully gelled hair +...,...a high-powered publicist + Oprah + The Today Show = instant bestseller. The only thing more simple than that math is the book.
2,Interesting Read,"This book was an interesting read, although I didn't agree with all of the theory within. I liked some of the ways that it tried to open women's eyes and see themselves in more positive lights, however it completely assumed that all men were cut from the same cloth. It was certainly interesting, but I found it flawed."
2,"What does this book tell you, that common sense doesn't","This has been one phenomenon that I can't quite comprehend. Who really needs this kind of book to tell you what should be obvious if you listen to your gut instincts. These authors are now rolling in the dough, because they wrote about a common sense approach to figuring out if a guy likes you. If a guy doesn't call you again after a date, what does that tell you? I know you can answer these questions yourself without reading this. Put your money to a better book."
4,hhes just not that into you,very good. interesting read. entertaining as well. i hope to put these words to use! i still wish i had more answers......
5,"A ""Must-read"" for Perplexed Single Women","Ladies, have heart -- we DON'T need to put up with this confusing male behavior any longer!! This book, written with humor and wisdom, addresses our most common questions about ""Why would he act like that?"" In spite of the title, you will feel MUCH better about what you have to offer in a dating situation after reading this fun (yet very serious) book."
4,"He may not be, but you should still read this book","I normally stick with fiction-you know, books like Kidd's ""Secret Life of Bees"" or Jackson McCrae's ""The Children's Corner?"" So when a friend recommended ""He's Just not that Into You,"" I balked. At first. Then I picked up a copy in a store and started skimming. Sure, some of it is nail-on-the-head right on. Some of it is not. That said, the majority of it was pretty good advice. Straight up."
4,No more dead-end guys,"Thank you Liz and Greg! Your book was recommended to me by a girlfriend and I must say it has opened my eyes. It is refreshing to find others who have the same problems as me. I will no longer waste my time with guys who can't seem to decide what they want. Very empowering!I also recommend Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories - A Guide to the Perils of Dating (How not to become a bar regular) and What Men Want, both entertaining and eye opening reads."
4,"Very entertaining book, but the truth? Hmm...","I really liked this book, I read it for entertainment purposes since it's based off of an episode of SATC, but didn't seem to feel any better about what the book was saying. So, I guess Greg will come yell at me if he finds me...or perhaps, since I'm only 21, the whole prince charming-love-marriage thing isn't that serious to me. Or maybe I'm a guy...because I feel like I do a lot of the things the guys are supposed to do (like not calling my boyfriend when I am supposed to), but it's not a big deal. I mean, do you really care if someone calls you on Monday instead of Sunday? I don't, but Greg sees everything as a sign of his not being into you. So maybe, I'm not into anyone, and no one is into me, and we all are into not being into each other. Perhaps I will become wiser with age...fun book though!"
5,"GREG, I GET IT FINALLY!!!!!!","This book came along just in time for me. As I watched Oprah and listened to those women telling their stories and asking Greg for advice for each of their situations, I found myself yelling at the t.v. screen. I was quick to solve all of their problems but I neglected to see a little bit of myself in each of their stories! After reading theis book, I will no longer call my girlfriends via 3-way and psychoanalyze why a guy isn't calling! It is not rocket science! He is just not that into me and it is his loss! DON'T WASTE THE PRETTY!!!!"
2,"Redundant, redundant, redundant","I read and enjoyed the first chapter. The second chapter was good. By the third chapter, I was looking for something that hadn't already been said. He takes one new sentence for the chapter title, then repeats the same information as he did in the first two. This would be better as just a magazine article than a whole book. I am dissapointed with this, and feel it was a waste of money."
1,If its cold outside use this book in your fireplace,"First of all, if you bought ""the rules"" then you don't need this book. Secondly, I don't need a MARRIED man telling me, a happy singleton how to act and what to do in regards to dating and relationships. If you do all that stuff the book suggests you to do you are not being true to yourself you are acting as a clone to the people who wrote this book. I say be yourself and be proud of who you are and if relationships don't work out then that wasn't the person that you were meant to be with. Get out of the house and go have fun. Don't waste your time reading this trash.I swear Oprah is not god... come on people she heavily endorses Dr. Phil who is a FAT guy who wrote a book on how to loose weight...now if that's not an oxymoron I don't know what is.Take the $15 dollars you would have spent on this trash and go buy yourself a drink, you deserve one."
2,my two cents,We are all only human beings living this complex thing called Life. The kind of advice this book gives can only backfire. It's just too superficial to make any sense. If you are having trouble in your intimate relationships why don't you go and learn about YOURself and the things INSIDE you that could be getting in the way? It's a hard journey but well worth the price. The two stars go to the authors (doomed) effort to try and help their best in this complicated arena.
2,Love at first sight or nothing at all?,"Greg is suggesting that all good relationships begin with love at first sight - the two are completely smitten with each other from the get go and that if this does not happen then then nothing will ever happen...Look at all the relationships around you and ask yourself how often this is the case? I believe that love can grow over time as people get to know each other. I'm not saying that if you're into a guy you should keep calling/stalking him when he's not getting in touch with you - I'm just saying that it's not always as clear cut as Greg suggests.He's also forgetting about shy guys who are totally into you but would rather live a loney life then risk the embarrassment of being rejected. And there are many of them.Quite entertaining, light, magazine like reading though which is why I give it the second star."
4,You already know this stuff!,"This book is a straightforward, easy read with almost zero psychobabble -- and most importantly, it's all stuff that we women already know in our hearts, even if we can't bring ourselves to admit it at the time.It does a great job of cutting through the imaginary subtext we apply to dating situations that are actually pretty simple. If he likes you, he'll call. If you're his Ms. Right, he'll ask you to marry him. With a few exceptions, when it comes to how a man feels about you, it's that easy. This book is just an entertaining and effective reminder of how simple it really is."
4,A different perspective,"The author makes several valid points; and my biggest take-away was if the guy makes you feel bad about yourself, guilty, or worried or makes you go through any sort of negativity, cut your losses and MOVE ON. yes, some men are shy, some men have parent issues, but most of them think as simply as you would. Its a different, rather simplistic take on relationships, as opposed to the sentimental tomes like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. The end message is clear ""If the guy likes you, he will definitely treat you well"""
3,My suggestion,"..I cant understand why this author refuses to write a sequel.....""She just isnt into you"". Im beginning to think he(the author) doesnt want to believe that chicks have not been that ""into him"". Come on dude...it happens to all of us from time to time (no matter how ravishing and good looking one is)..."
5,"Don't just read it and forget it, learn from it!","The authors make clear to women that if a guy was interested in you, he would make a move. And if YOU continue to hang on to someone who isn't interested in you, you will suffer. Likewise, life is too short to strangle yourself over things or people that aren't meant to be. Don't just read it and forget it, apply what you learned and go back to it when you need to relearn it.-D.E. BooneCreator of Legs Talk: A Modern Girl's Dating Tale"
3,~Funny..and thats about it~,"This book was alright but not something that i would take advice from. Many of the stories i read that other woman/men had submitted, got back what seemed like a absurd response. Sure the phrase ""Hes just not that into you"" was great for a while, but he used it on every person in the book. Many times it seemed that the problem wern't something to be reconciled by just dumping your partner."
5,Loved It,"I'm just upset that I didn't find this book before I found a wonderful guy. I use this book to counsel my friends because when you're in the middle of a bad situation, you can't see clearly. The title makes it sound insulting, but it is actually empowering. It constantly reminds women that we don't need to read into every single thing that guys do. Sometimes he's just not worth it and we should move on. Written in a very lighthearted, funny way. I highly reccommend to single women and especially their best friends."
3,Cautionary tale,"I wish I had read this book when I was younger. I spent my best years with all the various characters in this book. I had more than a few married men I was enthralled with, a couple of real freaks, a disappearing act, a few serious drug users, alcoholics figure in there and yes, a slew of decent guys who loved me that I ditched because they didn't make my heart sing. Now I am 55 and alone. I don't know if I would have listened to the advice in the book because I was headstrong. But I recommend all of you girls (and grown women) who are wasting your time with Mr. Wrong I, II and III to take a serious look at what you're doing. Being 55 and single is no fun. My past annoys me in the wee hours and the field is now very narrow. Proceed with caution."
3,Really lacks content,"I read this book from cover to cover, in about half an hour, and I seriously didn't get a whole lot of information other than a bunch of excuses guys give to avoid a relationship.There's nothing in the book about really UNDERSTANDING guys!That's where the book seriously lacks content! It's a funny read, it gives good examples of guys that are too lame to be real, but the rest is just not there.Greg is a fantastic writer as far as humor goes, his style made the book fun to read, but this is really NOT a serious relationship book.Basically, if you're getting mixed messages - MOVE ON! That's the message of the book, which is a good one, and that's all the book is about."
1,Really?,"If you don't pretty much understand this book when you read the title... there is something wrong. I suppose this book is a smack to the head for those who need it. Silly me... I thought it was obvious when a guy didn't call that he wasn't interested.Ladies - have some pride in yourself... get to know your soul, then find a mate... stop searching for a soulmate. Whatever that is.I don't understand the big deal about this book. Letters from mostly sad lonely women. I get it... dating sucks... but there is no excuse for the desperation required to need this as a self help book."
5,MOST HONEST AND FUNNY BOOK I EVER READ!,"This book basically throws in your face all the rotten stupid pathetic excuses we give for the jerks in our life and makes you realize that it's not ""ok"" to settle for crap and that it's better to alone then with someone and ""lonely"" ..The book hit home like no other and I recommend this book to any successful, talented, beautiful woman out there who is still asking herself why she keeps attracting losers and accepting less then what she deserves. You will realize that the excuses you've been given to these losers is a joke and that they aren't worth a second more of your time. Thanks Greg and Liz. I love Sex and the City and I LOVE your book! **I just found out that liz's cousin lives in my apt building in Brooklyn and sits next to me on the bus every day, how funny is that"
4,He's Just Not That Into You,"Great idea, all women need to read and understand this concept. All mothers should read this book to their daughters before they start dating. This information helps women identify worthless relationships. Wish the author had covered even more situations examples."
3,"Good, but nothing new","I enjoyed this book. However, honestly, it's really just a repackage of what ""The Rules"" told us in the 90s. I'd reccomend ""The Rules"" as a great companion to this book, because if you do them, you won't end up in the messes this book describes in the first place!"
1,Truthiness and the some.,"So I found this book in the lounge where I work and flipped through during lunch. If you get past the myriad of typos, the flawed/non-existent logic, and the fact it's not funny, there's pretty much nothing left but a nice looking cover.Still, even though I don't think of myself as an idiot, I took the book to heart. So days later when I ended up in the ER and had a very gorgeous doctor who seemed wildly attentive considering I only had a sprained ankle (he asked me for my number) and he didn't call, I assumed, ""Hey, he's just not into me."" and went about my life.Flash forward six months later, I get a call from a number I don't recognize. I let it go to voice mail purgatory only to discover it's my ""He's just not into you"" Doctor saying, ""I've been waiting the required six months before I could call you. I practiced calling you every day.""Hmmm, you think he's just not into me? or maybe this worked out because I played by the ""rules"". who knows? It's all hooey."
3,This review is for my wonderful wife . . .,"In the wisdom of James Brown . . . THIS IS A MAN'S WORLD! But it would be nothing without you, sweetheart."
2,It was OK,I read this book expecting to be enlightened. I guess I have just lived through enough of these events already to know what they mean now. I was not impressed with the book.
1,worthless,"this book is worthless and the women who read it for serious help are idiots. to understand the problems with the book, look no further than the 2 authors: 1 man and 1 woman.first: women do not understand how men think, and if they try to tell you otherwise they are morons.second: you may say ""but hey, look a guy co-authored the book!"" so it must be factual. but no straight man would ever participate in creating a book like this. and if the author is gay then he has just as little insight into the mind of a straight man as the female author.so, buy this book as a gag gift or something, but if you have to be a fool to take it seriously."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"Although I am only 21, I found this book to be extremely helpful....It's funny, honest and makes you want to do two things 1) dump everyone in your life who is not worth your time and 2) tell all your girlfriends that he's just not into her. Read it ladies, if you're sick of dating shady guys with no spine. You have to adjust it to fit your life, though. If you find the guy that says ""You're too smart for any book. Let's watch the Cubs game."" But doesn't call 5 times a day, and you think he's just not that into you, then you're just not that into yourself. Live it Learn it Love it, then Adjust it."
1,Surely You Jest...,"I've never seen ""Sex and the City"", and now I'll make sure I never do. This book just rehashes ""The Rules"" ad nauseum. If you accept simplistic stereotypes of the sexes, then enjoy. But if you have evolved enough as a human being to understand that people/relationships are complex, skip this book. OK, I confess; I didn't read it entirely, either; just a portion. That's as much time as I was willing to waste, and I'm CERTAINLY glad I didn't invest any money on it."
1,"forget the book, read these reviews!","I bought the book at a recent book signing (I'm a sucker for marketing) and have read some of it (it doesn't say anything new after the title). The book isn't as smart as it positions itself to be, and is actually quite shallow and not well thought out at all. Moreover, there is a typo within the first few pages ""he let's you know"" which shows you how quickly they slapped this together.What you *should* do is read the reviews on here. They are waaaay funnier than the book, and a lot of them are actually insightful, with good, well thought out advice... everything this book is not."
4,Refreshing and well-written,"I really enjoyed this book and it did give me some insights into some of the men I've dated. I just got engaged a week after I finished it, so thankfully I won't get a chance to put the things I learned to much use. All in all I recommend it for all single women out there."
1,Extremely one sided,"Wow, seriously! I'll admit there is some good common sense information in this book a lot of women could use. If the guy you're interested doesn't call you back or doesn't want to sleep with you, duh! But this author is way too ethnocentric. He's coming from a typical aggressive American kind of attitude that is absolutely not the way that ALL men are. What if the guy you like is from India, (or France, or Germany or...) do you think he'll behave in the exact predictable way that this author would? Hardly- he completely denies that men are different, have different emotional needs, different backgrounds, morals and values. All men do not behave in exactly the same predictable ways. Give me a break Greg!"
3,"A book on how to avoid shallow, tawdry men...","...If you're not a bimbo yourself.Someone should also write a book on how to avoid shallow, tawdry women."
4,You're Worth It and So Is This Book,"This book is funny, candid, and insightful. It's so engaging I read it in one sitting. Even though it offers what some might call common sense advice, we all need to be reminded of how relationships are supposed to work (and that doesn't mean what one person alone should do to make them work!). I'm tired of ""wasting the pretty,"" and I'm glad Greg and Liz have encouraged me not to settle for anything less than what I deserve."
2,Save your money girls!,"This book was so depressing, I couldn't even finish reading it and I'm sorry I read as much as I did. I was depressed for a week after reading it. This book oversimplifies the very complex world of dating and male/female relationships. Basically it tells you in a dozen chapters what could be said in one page. This book focuses on alot of the bad things guys do but it gives little hope or advice on where to find a good man who will treat you with respect."
3,I am on the fence,"So, this book isn't really bad , but it is common sense. We girls keep making excuses for the man when deep down we known what's going on. We just don't want to say it or belive it. The book basically says the same thing over and over in every chapter just different situations. Basically if the guy doesn't treat you like a princess then "" he is just not into you!"" That doesn't take a whoe book to say but and here is where credit is due; if you are hard headed and in one of these relationships maybe reading the whole book is what you need."
2,so now what do I do?,"Ok, so he's not that into me. I got the message. Now what? This is where I was hoping for answers, and just didn't get them. The book is funny and easy to read, but it doesn't give more in the area of what to do next. I wish it did."
1,"This book says excuses not doing, you need to find a reason why not.","This book purports the easy way out, quitting. If you take the author's advice you will fall into the `self help book quandary.' That being you will find an excuse NOT to when you need to find a reason WHY NOT. Forever you will find reasons and rationalizations. I bet, if you are old enough, the rules didn't work either. Neither will this!As a guy, I say that I don't agree with this book. In a world where men's traditional role in society is under attack (not a bad thing) and women are gaining power and influence in society, men are having self esteem issues. Not every man is Mr. Big, we don't all know we can `get' whatever we want. Thus when a man is not coming after you 110% it MAY just be that he is not 110% sure in himself. It used to be that men would be chasing women however, in a brave new world, women need to chase men a little more. Give us a nudge and we will go a mile with you."
1,Only read if you would like to be called an idiot!,"This book is the most degrading thing I have ever read. The author cleary does not actually LIKE women. Although I may agree that he is making some points here that we all know and advise that we could all give to our friends, but have a hard time following ourselves, I feel that the way this book is written it is actually extremely insulting. I would highly recommend reading the book, ""Be Honest, You're Just Not That Into Him Either"" by Ian Kerner - who is an actual sex tharapist and psychologist and who can also be very honest, but in a way that at least leaves a woman feeling like he is not calling her an idiot. His book is much more helpful, this one is not worth your wasted time!!!"
1,Nothing in life is this simple,"I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore, and I did watch the Oprah episode. I find the whole concept kind of creepy and controlling...as many others have mentioned, people are complex and none of us really know what is going on in someone else's mind. People tend to get so obsessed with self-help books searching for that perfect solution to what are basically just the trials of living life. My thought is that you should just be yourself and follow your heart- yes, you may get hurt, but what kind of life are you going to lead if you worry about every little signal a guy sends you?"
1,"ok so most men really are punks who arent str84ward, so?","Women, don't buy this book. If you don't know what the authors are saying then 1) you're seriously naive; 2) you're in complete denial; 3) you're seriously retarded or perhaps you're all three. Yes, men aren't usually straightforward and instead of just ""I'm not feelin's you"" they have to do all kinds of bs to let you know that. However, this is not rocket science nor some new, startling revelation. You do not need to spend $19.95 to find this out (and I'm glad I didn't...skimming is great!). What would be a great revelation (and what Greg conviniently leaves out) is why most men act like scared little mice when they're not into a girl and just don't come forward with the truth. Then again I guess that not too hard to figure out either although I'm sure someone will unforunately write a book on that too."
4,Great Book!,"This book is very witty, humorous, and straight to the point! However, I think the best thing about it is that it is a very accurate reflection of reality. In each chapter they address a ""type"" of guy and address the shortcomings of dating such a person. I gave it four stars not because the book itself had any issues but because if you buy the kindle version, you can't use the workbook section unless you print it out ahead of time, which just seems like kind of a hassle."
1,Actually a negative 1,Sex in the City is over. Over. This is just a thinly veiled disguise of the male pig. 100% pure chauvenism.
1,Too Much Negativity,"I don't even understand why this book is so popular. I suppose I should blame Oprah.I'm a firm believer that you can be with anyone you wish to be with. It is how you approach the situation. If you approach a man with wearing all of your insecurities on your sleeve, he probably won't be ""that into you"". And, this here is a the perfect segue into the main problem with this book.Most relationship problems are related to self-esteem issues and negativity. This book does not address how to manage your self-esteem. It does not go into why you feel that you need this one person. It tries to provide a simple solution to a not so simple problem a lot of women have. Worst of all none of these people have any degrees on psychology at all!Maybe this book is good for the few women that cannot get past the negativity they feel for being ignored, cheated on, ditched, ect. At this point though, I would recommend taking a break from relationships in general, but I digress."
1,Can't we just be ourselves?,"Behrendt's attempt at labeling and dividing makes me cringe. My experience tells me that both men and women are merely humans, good and bad, hot and not. After all, we're all a ""can of worms"" to some extent, so isn't it a matter of going about our lives, keeping our eyes open for opportunities to mesh our ""worms"" with someone else's."
5,A Guide to Understanding men a little or a lot better,"I think most women already know about this language barrier, or behaviour barrier, or do we? I don't think we want to know most of the time. Maybe it is more comforting, in the short term, to think that a promised call REALLy means that he is busy, gone to china, or dropped dead on his way to call us. It is probably no surprise to finally know that was not the case. I am so happy that Greg wrote this book. I think it is about time we all say what we mean, and mean what we say!! How idealistic of me!!Happy reading!!"
2,Not That Good,"I bought this book after seeing iton The [...] Show. It seemed like areally good informational book but, It wasextremely boring and gaveinformation most women already know"
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!,"This is the worst book I've ever read! Ladies, if you have any shred of self respect, dignity, and self-confidence...DO NOT waste your money! All this book does is fatten the bank account of an egotistical maniac who provided advice and input on a terrible TV show about a bunch of women with low self esteem who liked to sleep around. Save your money, or better yet, spend it on a book that is actually very well written: ""Get Smart With Your Heart"" by Suzanne Lopez."
1,Pass...,"Some of the things in this book are things that we all know. If he doesnt call you then he doesnt like you... thats simple. But in this book they make you think that if everything wasnt perfect then ""hes not that into you"".If you are reading it for fun then fine. But if you need help to know if he is the one... pass."
2,My wife would have dumped me,"If she had read the book. Now she's very happy I'm her husband (we have been married 17 years). She stood by be in the days when my confidence was shaken and I was not ""All There"" It makes me love here more knowing she didn't give up on me.I read the book to see if it could help my teenage daughter. Not appropriate for teenagers! Too much mature info.The book is too hard on men. We are not perfect. I know that's not what we should say now a days, but its true. Guys have fears and guys have doubts. There are jerks and dead-beats out there. However some of guys will break-up because they don't think they are good enough for this wonderful lady.100% of guys surveyed said, ""We are not perfect. We do get depressed. We say and do things we regret."""
4,Striking a chord,"This book isn't the gosple of dating, but the advice it gives on dating is pretty liberating. Plus, I'll gaurantee you'll giggle. Read it's entire contents in one hour and be free."
4,Greg gave me the Brotherly Advise I was Lacking,"WOW! This book is so awesome. Yes there are many things in this book I already knew, but somehow hearing them from a Guy cemented them as truths. My favorite lines in the book were ""Don't waste the Pretty"" and ""Put down the [...]"". This was a fun and easy read. I will be buying it for all of my confused girl friends who are still wasting their time. Transforming truths and tough facts put in a funny and encouraging way! Go get it! When you are done reading this book you won't be wasting the pretty anymore. Thanks Greg, you gave me the big brother advise I could have used years ago.Single and loving it in Reno,Airaka"
2,If you have any problem in your relationship then the guy doesn't care about you and you should wait around for Prince Charming,"Ok, I'm not the typical reviewer or reader of this book. I'm almost 15. I read this book when my friend, who was going through a bad time with a jerk, brought this book for me and my friends to read. Not one of us was, in Greg's very special opinion, was going out with a guy who was really into us. Not one of us had ever met a guy who was really into us. The book depressed us for about a week. Then we decided we had to forget about it. The book says if you're not with Romeo, you're with a jerk. Of course, Greg might be right. I'm not a guy, I don't know. But it seems like less of a way for girls and women to find good men, and more of something to help guys get girls out of their faces. I don't know about you, but I'm going to live life by my own rules."
5,Eyes Wide Open!,"Finally, a book on dating that actually may be useful! While reading this book -- you will laugh, cringe, cry and likely change the way you approach relationships from now on. The truth hurts, but it will also set you free. This quick, witty book is a great value. I'm sending a copy to all my single friends."
2,"No, I'm afraid this book isn't correct...","Men are simple, that much is true. But this book isn't correct. Let me tell you my own (short) story. I was a single guy, dating occasionally, enjoying the city. Couple of times I met women and began to get serious, only to get dumped/burned and hurt.Then I meet a great girl and this time I think ""better slow right down, it it's to be, it'll be"". I made the first call, but after a dinner or two, I got on with my life and waited for an occasion where we were with mutual friends again. I should stress that I wasn't playing games, just protecting my heart.Result? Five years of happy (with ups and downs) marriage later, two beautiful boys and a gorgeous wife I'd support in all she does and wants to be.Behrendt on the other hand, would have you believe that my not pursuing her like a dog on heat meant I wasn't interested.The lesson? No idea. But I guess what's meant for you, won't pass by you."
2,"For daters, not married people","Relationships dont work when a man and women are totally equal 50/50. Too much tension, and power struggling. The most successful marriages I know are when either the man or woman has slightly more control. This book is for women who are ""man-haters"", or soon will be. I can sum up this book with one thought. When a man does one stupid thing, dump him. Thats the message here. DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ARE MARRIED, WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,You got to be kidding me!,"I started reading this book, just to see what it was about...Iread few pages and I was furious. They actually published this thing? If we (women) were to follow this book,we would end up....unhappy, old, and alone! Who makes up these rules? Do what you feel is right for you!!!! Not what society want you too!"
3,Kinda boring and common sense,"It was common sense advice. If you don't have friends who would tell you this stuff, it might be helpful."
5,Awesome,Well I wish I had read this book years ago....would have saved me many heart aches. I date now with a new outlook and when things don't work out.....I just know there is nothing wrong with me....he is just that not into me....but there is someone out there that will be. Awesome book.
3,Nice read,"This ""No-Excuse Truth to Understanding Guys"" explains a variety of relationship issues, such as guys not calling, disappearing, cheating, etc. The explanation is universally that if the guy really wanted to be with you, he would not be acting in this way. And no amount of waiting/changing/loving/etc will change that fundamental flaw in your relationship (or non relationship).Quote: ""I know it's nice to have companionship and wake up with somebody that you really like, but that's what pets are for. Pets are God's way of saying, ""Don't lower the bar because you're lonely.""I found this book to be more-or-less entertaining, although occasionally disheartening (the things women put themselves through!) Although I could not relate to a lot of the conflicted situations related in the stories. However, taken as extremes for the sake of proven a point (which I am sure are sometimes valid), I found them to be entertaining."
3,Better Yet.....,"This is good and easy reading, but I must recommend the book ""Stop Getting Dumped"" as further reading material regarding this subject. Enjoy:)"
1,What a sham!,"Do women need to read this? Seriously; if there is a guy, that you like, who is avoiding you, do you really need to read a book to figure out his motives? Common Sense Please!"
3,A good place to start...,"When I first heard about this book, I was sure it would be chock full of answers to the mysteries of men. In truth, this book is funny, but only a good place to start understanding how to handle yourself in relationships. I think that like any advice you get, about half of it is applicable. Not every situation is quite so cut and dried, but there is some good advice in the book. If you're a single female, it's worth reading, but be smart about what you take away from the book."
5,Very insightful and funny!,"I saw great reviews on this book, so I purchased it today. Couldn't put it down after I started it. I laughed my butt off during some of the comments. I am going through a divorce after 13 years of marriage, so it has been a while since I dated. I reconnected with a high school interest and have been getting very mixed signals. I bought this book to shed some light on it. I found this book to be very insightful. After 13 years of marriage, I lost myself and forgot what it feels like to be truly happy and what I deserve in a relationship. This book emplowered me to understand the mixed signals and the games of dating. It gives you the basics and allows you to use your own judgement. Use this as a tool ladies, not an all encompassing dictionary to love. You will enjoy it! As for me, I cut my losses and moved on..."
3,State the obvious,"The author comes off as a douchebag, because he states the obvious. The moral or the story, guys say what they mean 95% of the time, and if they are not saying what they mean its because they are scared of the girl killing them or herself. Prteyy much sums up the whole book. No Da vinci code here."
2,A One Note Book,"This book is very simple and repetitive. The title says it all. It could be useful, however, if you are the type who gets fixated and obsesses about guys who are not really available or interested in you. If so, you may want to do some deeper work on self love, which is the key to finding a partner who truly cherishes you. Check out my Amazon list, ""So You'd Like to Find a Love Relationship..."" for some great books that can help you on that path."
3,A Reality Check For The Troubled Woman,A Q&A style book addressing common scenarios of women and their boyfriends. Relationship experts Greg and Liz share their advice from both the male and female perspective.
3,medicore...,"I'm not a female in denial. I would probably recommend that 1) borrow the book from a friend. 2) a lot of generalizations. I know that men and women are different but not all men are the way the book is describes and not all women are that naive. So when you read the book, be open minded that some of the things can be factual as to the reasonings.That being said I did take away a few pointers...if anything just the mental thought of keep telling yourself that ""he's just not that into you"" to be able to move on. Afterall, how long should you waste your time on someone who is not giving you what you want?"
5,Don't waste the pretty!,"There is humor mixed in with the telling of the simple truth about the way men operate. Greg Beherendt has a lot of compassion for all of us in telling us, ""Don't waste the pretty."" I learned a long time ago that men know what men are up to, just as women know women. The book on women would take volumes. This book is one thin volume. Men are not that complicated. Greg says, ""Don't waste the pretty."" He made it very clear that if a man is 'into you' he will move heaven and earth to be with you. On the other hand, men would rather be run over by a train, get their legs cut off and lose their right eye (my words) rather than just tell you, ""I'm just not that into you."" You find out in this book that it is just that simple. There is no figuring it out. Greg goes over every excuse you have ever heard. There is no turn unstoned. Read this book. Laugh at the humor. Learn. And don't waste the pretty!"
1,Very very simplistic--best for 18-22 year olds!,"If I had read this and believed it, then I would have abandoned the best relationship I've had--with a very shy guy. Not all guys fit into this mold, so take this with a grain of salt and a good laugh.It seems as if this ""Sex and the City"" catchphrase has gone on too long, and Behrendt's 15 minutes should be over soon."
1,Logic here?,"So why should we assume that if a man likes a woman, then he will take the initiative and ask her out?Couldn't the guy assume the same? So if a woman likes a man, why shouldn't she take the initiative and ask him out? (And if she doesn't then she must not like him)With their logic, I must not really like this shy guy in my class, because I have not asked him out yet."
4,"The Art of Mixing, underline Art","I learned a lot about what is possible, but very little on the nuts and bolts of how to do it. So as long as you understand that this is not for someone trying to learn how to run sound, or how to EQ, or how to tune a system, but rather for someone who wants to take it to the next level."
1,I still do not know what this dvd is supposed to teach...,"I find the dvd useless. It does not provide in-depth look at anything related to mixing. It only tells one idea, which is not bad, and then repeats, and repeats, and repeats...I would kill the people trying to be funny if I could, also... They just make me get severely unmotivated to keep watching the dvd."
5,worth far more,"i bought this card to go into a computer i was moving into my home entertainment system, and it replaced a soundblaster live! (due to the digital optical out). setup was a breeze. before hooking it into my entertainment center, i tried it out with some mp3's my computer setup. whoa. i immediately noticed an improvement with my cambridge speakers, made by creative (the same people who make soundblaster). i then tried out the optical out. it performed well unless the volume on the computer was turned all the way up, and then it tended to pop in and out. however, if i set the computer at 3/4 volume and then turned up the volume on my receiver, it performed perfectly at about the same audible volume as my cd player. come to think of it, the problem may have been with overloading the input on the receiver. have been running it without a thought to my soundcard for the past 6 months. highly recommended."
2,Cheap card for the really budget conscious,"Wake up guys, all this card can output is two stereo, that is to explain simply left & right signal at your front jack and left & right signal at your rear jack. No point in using any fancy dvd decoder software with this card, it will only burst your bubble. I sold mines and bought the Fortissimo II, it does the real thing."
3,DONT BUY FOR MINIDISK RECORDING!,"Hey, i bought this just for the optical out, and wanted to see if it would skip the tracks for me (since it is optical) on my minidisk dubbing deck. Well, i just put the thing on record and the music sounds great on my home theatre system...unbelieveable for bootlegged mp3s. But sadly, the optical out will not space out the tracks, so when recording to mini disk, it will make all the MP3s one large track. On the other hand...this is one good sounding card to plug up to a home audio system---i just cant stand computer speakers.later"
5,Sound card,I have used this card in the past with other computers and it works beautifully with all platforms. A defininte buy!
1,Passenger Side Mirror Not Correct,"The mirror fit just fine, looked ok, even says something like ""Objects in Mirror are Closer than they Appear"".The problem is that this is a lie. The mirror is a flat mirror, not a parabolic mirror like is typical on a passenger side mirror. The mirror surface is sort of wavey, and not crisp. For the cost, this is tolerable, but really? Non parabolic mirrors? Are you kidding?I would encourage you to go buy a real one and tell this K Source business off."
3,Skip this and get 'The Complete Irish Tinwhistle Tunebook' instead.,"If you aren't able to get 'The Complete Irish Tinwhistle Tunebook' for some reason then this would be be a fine substitute, albeit at twice the price of the former. Like the 'Tunebook', this is a collection of mainly reels and jigs, with a few hornpipes, polkas and others. The staff size is quite small because two or three tunes are crammed on each page. So, if you don't mind paying twice the price for the same number of tunes stuffed onto a third of the number of pages get this book, otherwise get the 'Tunebook' by the same author."
3,Cute but missing critical parts on Christmas Eve,"When received we stored away until Christmas Eve, was a ""Santa"" gift. At midnight we're assembling it to find it's missing one of the large screws that hold the railing on AND one of the mobile strings was missing and it wasn't easy finding either at that hour to make it work. I didn't see any other option on Amazon to just get the parts replaced, I do not wish to return, would just like to get it fixed before it gets broken."
3,Very cute crib,"The crib itself is great. The canopy has no way to be secured to the poles so it is constantly moving out of place. True, I will stitch some snaps to keep it in place, but I had not planned to.The biggest complaint is that the mobile hits the child's face when she approaches to play with the baby doll. I am looking for the opportunity to ""loose"" the intrusive mobile before she gets hit wrongly or, worse yet, one of her friends does."
2,Damaged package!,The package was on one end was completely torn up. We haven't opened it yet but it looks like some of the wood pieces may be chipped. I can't imagine why they would ship an obviously damaged package. This is a Christmas present for my granddaughter. Hopefully when we open it and put it together it will be ok.
5,great product,I purchased this and the high chair for my daughter for christmas last year. She loves it it is very sturdy and nicely made. she is 5 now and still plays with it almost every day. One of the best purchases i have made. would recommend to anyone! Great product even the mobile works!
5,Great crib for baby dolls,"I bought this crib as an alternative to the more famous brand my daughter asked for. This was a great buy. My husband and I put it together easily in about 40 minutes. The wood is slightly softer than I would have liked, but it is a baby doll crib...lol Very cute when put together. Great price for what you get. My daughter loved it more than the one in the fancy catalog. The bins on the bottom are great storage for all the extra toys and doll accessories. Having everything come together in one package/price was a relief. Other brands had everything priced seperate. Glad for everything included."
5,granddaughter loved it,"I purchased this toy and the high chair for one of my grandaughters for Christmas. She wanted a ""real"" furniture for her dolls. This was the closet thing to real furniture. We had to put it together, but it was not that difficult and all the pieces were there. When she saw the baby bed and the highchair, she didn't want to leave them here at my house. She just had to take it home. She loves the mobile that really works and the way the bed is made. Great toy for any little girl who wants ""real"" furniture for her dolls!"
4,great buy,"So cute, looks great in the play room, Bitty Baby is just right, just what a little girl needs for her baby!!"
4,Really cute,"This doll bed arrived very quickly and was not damaged in any way. It was easy to assemble. Follow the instructions and do not overtighten the canopy poles or I think they would crack. The mobile was too long. I cut the strings to make it hang higher and it was fine. The canopy itself doesn't stay put very well and does have to be straightened a lot, but that does not deter from it's charm. I would purchase this again. My granddaughter loves it and thats what matters most."
2,"An Ok, baby bed.","It's good enough for a kid to sit and play with. Unfortunately the adult who has to put this together is going to be ticked off when they realized the piece of crap they are about to deal with. The four post of the bed are very poorly made, if you give it one squeeze too much, you just cracked the wood on the bed. If you twist the bed post to not crack them, you will see how lose and wobbly they are. Its a no win situation. You have to crack the wood (which they warn to not twist too tight to prevent this) in order for it to align right. Garbage, but I put it together and the material covers the cracks. I suppose if you wanted to go all out you could putty and paint them back up.The canopy on top has two rails, but its not enough to hold the canopy up and it keeps sinking or sliding off. This was very poorly designed. Obviously by people who were looking for a quick buck. On a positive note the mobile was cute."
1,Useless,"I bought this crib for my 2 year old daughter. When I tried to assemble it I realized that it's defective. The holes where the screws were supposed to be inserted were drilled way too wide. And it wasn't just one corner of the crib, it was all four corners therefore it was completely unfixable. I called the company, but they were closed. They are only open Monday-Thursday and this was Friday. Needless to say my daughter was disappointed, and I had to return the item to the store. I wonder how many defective cribs they shipped this holiday season! Interestingly enough, they include a flyer that if a product is defective to please call them and not contact the seller. After seeing the poor quality of this product I would not risk buying from this company again. I had just bought the Melissa and Doug high chair, which was a breeze to set up. The reason I went with this crib vs. the Melissa and Doug is that this one has storage underneath. I guess now I might reconsider."
1,Horrible quality,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. Within just weeks, the mobile has broke, the ribbons have broke and the base broke. Even had these things not broken, it's really low quality. I wish I could send it back."
4,Doll Crib,"Santa brought this for my daughter. I only have one complaint with it and that is the canopy material falls off. I wish it was made so it wouldn't fall off so easily when the crib is being played with. The ribbons on the post's are the only things keeping it in place and it doesn't secure it very well. But everything else is perfect. The wood is very sturdy and it was very easy to put together. I am a 33 year old mother and I put this together by myself and it didn't take very long. My guess would be maybe 10-15 minutes. Really nice crib, great buy."
4,A little girls dream crib,I bought this same exact doll crib by badger basket for thirty-five dollars! and with site to store it was a way better deal. so please shop and compare elsewhere before throwing your money away... you might even be able to buy an extra gift this holiday season.
1,Cheap materials didn't last 2 months!,I bought this for my in home daycare. It was difficult to put together and very cheaply made. I ended up throwing it away after just 2 months of use. Don't waste your money!
4,Perfect for S Corps,"If you have an S Corp and have all kinds of questions about documents. This is the perfect book to help you understand the records you have to have and more importantly, you get a CD with docs to create your own documents!"
5,Very thorough and direct,"I'm a software engineer, not a lawyer, so I can't directly vouch for the accuracy of the legal forms and advice - but to me, the number of 5-star reviews from actual lawyers (many of whom say they use it a reference themselves) speaks for itself.As far as the book goes, it is very thorough, clear, direct to the point, and well-organized. It clarifies what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and how to do it. With this book as a reference, I am breathing a lot easier about not paying a lawyer $400/hour to fill in boilerplate for me."
5,Excellent!,"This is an incredible and comprehensive guide book that I ever encountered. I really believe that if I had this book in the early part of my career, I would climbed the ladder much faster. I've shared this book with my coworkers and they said the same. Extremely concise and in almost a 1-2-3 format--very easy to follow."
5,"booring topic, made palatable","it has the facts, something we all hate dealing with... but glad this book exists...opens your eyes to proper record keeping"
3,Useful for the small business owner - Good advice; so-so forms,"I'm a lawyer, and I've reviewed a few NOLO books, and then I've also bought a couple I've found which might be helpful in my practice. Since I serve on the board for a small charitible corporation (and do it for free), I thought this might be a handy book to have for the forms. Everybody I've ever known hates keeping corporate records to one degree or another, but they are a necessity, and I thought this would be useful for helping some of my small-business clients.What I discovered as is that the advice in the book is useful, relatively clear, accessible, and well organzized, as to what kinds of records need to be kept and why. However, the forms are mostly simplistic, with an aggravating and distracting small logo that prints at the bottom of the form.The book's good advice. The forms don't really save you that much work.4 stars for the advice and 3 stars for the forms."
5,Large and detailed,"For those who own a limited liability corporation, this is a detailed and useful guide specifically covering meetings, minutes, & resolutions. This 5th edition gives you the most up-to-date laws governing limitied liability corps. In the back of the back, there are a myriad number of legal forms that can be torn out. Also included is a CD which has all the forms in digital format."
3,No idea if it is any good... Amazon did not ship it to me,"I ordered this on Amazon vine, but alas, they never shipped it. With regulatory expectations increasing for records retention, boards of directors and thoroughness of policies and proceedures, this is a much needed reference. Too bad I'll never know if its any good."
5,Buy extras - they're not expensive,Getting extra sticks and pucks is a good inexpensive insurance policy in case the pucks or the sticks get lost.
4,Serve Our Purpose,The sticks and pucks are needed to play our nok hockey game.A game that i use to play as a child and enjoying it again with my son and wife
1,No pucks!!!!,I never recieved the 2 pucks that were supposed to come with the two sticks!!! (that were paid for!!!)
4,Good Stuff for Whispher fans,"This is a good CD for all the Whisper faithful. You won't be dissapointed by this product at all.My favorite cut is "" Rest my lips"" which was written by the great song writer Gary Taylor. This song is so mature,and talks about a man's emotions in a way few ever do. This song alone was worth the price of the CD. The cut ""Sticks and Stones"" is another outstanding cut that's just a straight jam to get you up and going!I could go on and on but Whispers fans know what to expect. So if you haven't heard this CD and your a Whispers fan, this one will fit right in with all the other great CD's these fellas have done."
5,NOT MUCH OF AN ENGINEER,"AN EXCEPTIONAL READ, SIR STANLEY HOOKER MOST CERTAINLY WAS A BRILLIANT ENGINEER WHO ACHIEVED SO MUCH FOR ROLLS ROYCE & BRITAIN ITSELF. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND ""HERMAN THE GERMAN"" TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE JET ENGINE."
5,Topnotch!,"Beautifully written! Forget any notion of engineering being dry or tedious - Hooker and Gunston make this story come alive. If you have the slightest interest in aviation or aero engines, BUY THIS BOOK. I think even a person who knows nothing of these topics will find NOT MUCH OF AN ENGINEER totally absorbing.It's that good."
3,are u kiddin...,u guys give this cd a 1? its not bad but its not great...they do have some good songs like quick to back down...twilight and bravehearted this cd was actually not that bad bravehearts are alrite
1,Worst ever queens is in shock,terrible terrible why didn't columbia come out with another nas album wiz and jungle both have no talent only good song is the single and it got played out every song has terrible beats god i am discusted with this release4.5 of 10 lyrics 3.5 of 10 beats
1,Worst of 2003,terrible terrible why didn't columbia come out with another nas album wiz and jungle both have no talent only good song is the single and it got played out every song has terrible beats god i am discusted with this release4.5 of 10 lyrics 3.5 lyrics
2,"Ok, how do I do this?","Production is very nice, guest appearances by Nas are good, but the Bravehearts are plain and straight up wack. ""Quick 2 Back Down"" is a hot song to bump, and was lyrically good because of Nas verse. ""Sensation"" is horrible lyrically...""Situation"" is Ok...the CD isn't really worth purchasing, just download ""Quick To Back Down"""
2,why?,i dont know anything about rap or music aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwe love you backstreet boys!
2,Bravehearts are not Nas...,"so don't expect them to be or you will be let down tremendously cause these dudes suck! Wasn't expecting too much being that every song I heard that they appeared on Nas traks they sucked and ruined pretty bad. The cuts with Nas are cool, beats are average but lyrics are pouring with wack juice. Quick to Back Down is the only stand out trak."
2,Terrible,"I give this 2 stars because of the songs that Nas appears in. ""Quick To Back Down"" and ""Situations"" are the only songs you should listen to. The rest of the songs here are terrible. The skits are very pointless too."
4,Buck Diesel East Hartfords Don Kiluminati,"4 outta 5This album is defenitly been underated there lyrics are not bad but not great if you are in to the Queens Bridge type of rap youll know what Iam talkin about Dun the Beats are all great especially B-Train, Twighlight, and Quick 2 Back Down if you liked the QB'S FINEST album Cop this one"
1,Worst album of the year! no stars,Nas you cant help all you boys out. This album sucked to the max. All this all is talkin about getting girls that they cant get and only can get cause they know Nas. Everyone cant be a gansta in NYC. This album sucked to is a waste of time. IF this is the best Queensbrigde got go back to MC Shan.
1,Worst Queens album in history,this cd distrubs me do not buy it unless you wanna blow money there are several okay/good songs but there isint one punch line on this cd there are attempts but no punch lines and there is not one good beat besides the single which got played out and braveheartedFavorite Track:NoneGuests:Nas and Jully Black4 of 10 lyrics 2.5 of 10 beats
2,A disappointment,"""Bravehearts"" are the classic example of a well ainticipated album that became a disappointment. Unfortuneatly, excluding ""Quik To Back Down"" and ""Bust My Gun"", the beats are just as weak as the sub-par lyrics. However, the unexpected combination of Lil Jon with the Bravehearts deliver a refreshing single on ""Quick To Back Down."" Despite their affiliation with Nas, that fact that he hasn't had a large influence on the young Bravehearts is apparent as the lyrics are foreign to those of Nas. Clearly, the expectations of Nas fans were too high for the Bravehearts."
1,Horrible,"Every song on the cd is garbage besides ""Quick To Back Down"" and thats only because it features Lil Jon and Nas. Other then that, Bravehearts are heartless without Nas. Nas should just rap the whole album instead and then maybe it will sell some records."
2,not as got as nas,"yo what is this,this cd sucks its teribble.there's about 4-5 ill songs and the rest of the cd is crap. b-train is ill but its only 2:10 long.of course quick to back down is illtastic,twilight is ought only cause of nas,and cash flow got a HOT BEAT.THats about it the rest of the cd is teribble dont waste your time and mony on this cd PEACE OUT"
4,best selling Queenbridge rappers,"This album is full of ghetto stuff, this album is keeping it gutter and gangsta. This album I have listened to twice, it is not that bad of an album, parents are wanting to know, this album has some foul language but not much except the few first tracks, otherwise the album is GREAT!!! I suggest you buying this album if you quick to get KRUNKED and like hardcore and gangsta music. The album songs is great like I wanna and Quick 2 Backk Down and B train. The greatest ever, how was my review."
4,Orgy of terror,"There are few things on this planet that are left which can amaze me with the fancy ""special effects"" and ground breaking computer enhancement techniques, and so it is that it is left to the plot to keep us intrigued. Crystal Force uses primitive and ground breaking techniques to create this ""orgy of terror"". It encompasses all of the most basic human emotions in a well rounded story of loss and love. Laura Keats(director)does an amazing job of blending script and human touch. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that the nudity is often times grainy and hard to make out. Although maybe that is knit-picking. Buy it and find out for yourself why this ""orgy of terror"" had me screaming all the way to the bedroom..."
5,Easy clean up and more,These bibs not not only help you avoid washing one more shirt a day but they entertain the child. These wash with ease and stains do not set in even after 3 weeks of sitting. I also use the pocket to place items so my son entertains himself instead of ripping the bib off.
4,Great old SAC footage,"This is a collection of training films produced for Strategic Air Command during the Cold War. Security procedures and communications are covered. Lots of cool footage you can't see anywhere else. Security Police, Missile Combat Crews, and SAC headquarters are shown. An expensive disc, but I enjoyed it."
2,Stabbing your eardrums with toothpicks would be more entertaining...,"Dear God - this is pretentious, bland pop trash at it's worst.First, right out of the way, let me say that I was looking forward to getting this disk, after listening to a snippet of the first track, 'Embryo'.Also let me say, I hadn't listened to any of Rosa's solo albums prior to that snippet, but I was a big fan of his work with Maggie's Dream, and I can't say that I was prejudiced against him regarding the whole Menudo thing. You break into the business however you can, I guess.But this...The first track being the exception here, the music is bland and uninspired, the lyrics are pretentious attempts at 'poetry', and Rosa's voice has the most annoying, droning whine imaginable to it.Ug.Luckily enough, I got it used for less than $5."
1,"I needed help, but sorely disappointed!","I thought that this book would be more helpful than it was. In fact, out of the church seasons I have used it, Advent through Easter, I have used material from it only twice. The format is appealing if you use a lectionary to develop your preaching calendar, but for the cost, it should be more productive. Part of the problem is that it is much to brief on a week to week basis. Not helpful at all!"
4,The Mission Cabinet,"The cabinet was easy to put together. One thing we didn't know was you need a wall to mount it since the depth is small and is easy to pull over with it filled with videos. Nice quality, but not sure the glass is really tempered."
4,I love Hitwoman using Chloroform!!,"Great movie it is!!For years I have loved to see Hitwomen killing men using Chloroform. But it is very rare.This video shows Hitwoman kills men with soaked rag.She covered nose and mouth of targets firmly!!If you love Hitwoman using Chloroform, don't miss it!!"
1,Worst World History SAT Book I've Seen,"I bought this book out of hope for a supplement to the official guide. However, the tests in this book deviate drastically from the official tests and the collegeboard book on world history and U.S. history. It focuses very much (about 10% of all questions) on post-WWII history, while that portion of history merely represents around 1% of the real test.I would advise people who are looking at this Kaplan book to consider other options, especially the official one. I haven't used the Princeton Review one yet but Barrons is another option."
5,all in one solution,I love the gentle lavender fragrance of this shampoo and body wash. I received it a shower gift in a sample pack and will be ordering more. It's the only soap/lotion I use on my baby's skin and scalp; nothing additional has been necessary.
2,Footnote to my previous review,"I'll concede that, yes, I was a bit too harsh in my condemnation of the box set. One way or another, you need to hear the `unplugged' Debut material and the `Jools Holland show' performances...But, as I said, these and other items are already available on DVD. Only one and a half discs of previously-unreleased material is not worth forty-something US dollars, even with the mini-DVD and booklet taken into account.And my criticisms still stand regarding the ""play-it-safe"" track selection. Perfectionism is not a virtue where archival releases are concerned - someone like Bjork who puts so much experimentation and improvisation into her live performances requires a live album - if you get my drift - less like 'Frampton Comes Alive' and more like `You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore'."
4,Great In-Depth Instruction,"I found this book and cassette very useful in learning an Irish accent. As someone who completely lacks any natural gift for mimicry, I needed the detailed information and numerous techniques that Stern offers. The only drawback was that the extensive focus on technique left relatively little room on the tape for examples of Irish speech. I would have liked to hear more monologues."
3,its skinless pt 2,"with the departure of original vocal man shirwood webber, skinless is still going strong. the overall feel is a bit more serious then previous stuff. a war is hell lyrical theme as opposed to old stuff like pool of stool."
2,couldve got three stars,"its a heavy album, which is why it got 2 stars, but it brought nothing new to the table. not song wowed me. the only song that caught my attention was the last track which reminded me of rage against the machine. song had no place on the album. esp as the last song."
5,very enjoyable read,"i highly enjoyed the author's spirit of positive thinkingespecially when he says yes when it's a big no situationhe gets himself in strange and hilarious situations,goes to places and meets people he would never had metand that's the power of YESit is a very funny book and YES i recommend it alot"
4,Really Funny!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was extremely funny and I often found myself laughing out loud in the middle of airports waiting for delayed planes, or when we I read the book out loud to my friend we were both sneakering to the point where I would need a minute to compose myself before I was able to go on reading.Danny Wallace is an excellent storyteller not only did I laugh but his experience made me want to actually say yes more even if I didn't win large sums of money or got a promotion."
5,Say Yes to the opportunities!,This book is just breakthrough book to an unexpected opportunities that life prepares for us.It is as good as a movie based on it but much detailed and with additional adventures.
5,The 'Rat Is Back!,"Over two years ago, the news came out that EMI would remaster and re-release the classic progressive rock album ""Spartacus"" by the German group Triumvirat. I have been eagerly awaiting the cd ever since. The wait was well worth it. I've owned the album for over 25 years and I'm hearing notes I never heard before. Often called the German ELP, this group is also similar to early Yes and some of Rick Wakeman's concept albums. This album is also a concept album telling the story of the slave revolt led by Spartacus made famous in the movie of the same name starring Kirk Douglas. The music fits the story perfectly and the muscianship is superb, let by Juergen Fritz's music and synthesizer and keyboard work, Hans Bathelt's drumming and lyrics, and Helmut Koellen's vocals. This is the seminal work from this group, and belongs in the collection of any progressive rock or ELP fan."
5,...really pleasant memories!,"Never a great fan of the ""art/pomp-rock"" bands of the mid-to-late 70's, I nevertheless took ""Spartacus"" to heart when my brother brought it home from college. I bought my own copy of it, never even attempting to turn my high school classmates, (really into R.E.O. and Styx) onto it. I figured that I was one step way ahead of them owning this.Now it's out on CD, and re-mastered. The best complement that I can give it is that when my copy came and I put it in the player, I instinctivly sang along with every word, almost as a reflex, despite the fact that it has been a good five years since I pulled the old LP out.I highly reccomend this, as well as ""Old Loves Die Hard"" (...no concept, just cool!)"
3,This Is Triumvi Tap,It seemed great when it came out in the 70s and I thought myself to be an obscure music conniseur. But today...well its good that its available for posterity sake.
4,Good release...,"While I prefer Illusions on a Double Dimple, this release has some nicestuff on it. Obvious ELP overtones (more so than Illusion's).."
5,It brought me back to my youth,"I discovered Trimuvirat during my wild youth in San Francisco back when SF a was still accessible to us regular folks and hippies.I loved their fresh sound and ELP like style.Spartacus was always my favorite album, deep, thoughtful and satisfying, and yes profound. March to the Eternal City to represents the best of the Triumvirat/ELP genre.The remastered CD sounds excellent with good dynamic range and a clarity of bass that allow to almost count the cycles in the low frequency ranges without the thumpy bass you often get in remasters neither is there any sibulance or raspiness at the upper.All in all it is well mixed and produced.I recommend this to any Triumvirate fan, or you are unfamiliar with them and enjoy ELP, try it.Amazom had a nice deal on this bought with Illusions on Double Dimple, add free supersaver shipping and you have a great deal."
1,Crotton difamed!,Disappointment .THE HR MARKERS 3 FELT OFF PREVENTING THE SECONDS NEEDLE TO ROTATE.Had it fix by certify distributor.the glass gets foggy.The STAINLESS STEEL BAND IS BUT THE PIN THAT HOLDS IT IT IS NOT SO IT WOULD FELT OFF WITH ANY LITTLE BITTY RESISTANCE.I have bought this brand before it looks like this was made at china by a Chinese who made sure it was a crappy watch.Or simply a replica.Just will not ever by this brand.I owned 23 watches from 3 brands so I know enough!
3,feedback,"This watch has screw in pins for band adjustment that are striped and don't work well. I got the band to adjust but one pin is sticking out and will not go in. Boy, you would think you would get a good product for the money. The rest of the watch works OK and looks fine."
5,SINK THE PINK,"yeah most ACDC albums sound the same, but they are so good at it.this is also another one of the ACDC releases that really benifited from remastering.DANGER is one of the few slow songs done with brian johnson.the rest of the cd just rocks (acdc rock)"
4,Still good after all these years,"I always liked 'Fly on the Wall'. It doesn't compare with 'Back in Black' or 'Highway to Hell' on the number of great songs but it wasn't a slouch effort. The songs still kept the AC/DC feel and sounded best when turned up really loud. Considering the past two efforts from the band, something a little less than spectacular was to be expected. But given that, the band still rocks. This effort is still one of my favorites. They have kept to the formula that made them the rock and roll stars they are and it still works. This is not an album to pass by for those of you who are just discovering or rediscovering AC/DC. Rock On.!"
3,Classic 80s rock,AC/DC in 1985 were not the hottest band on the scene...... There album that came out then Fly On The Wall is also not there greatest album. There's nothing wrong with this album it still is hard rock but it just is one of those forgotten albums by a band like these guys. ITs okay only for huge fans
3,Even AC/DC Can Have A Bad Day,"It's definitely not some of their best work. I only listen to it once in a while and a lot of times I stop half way through. They just weren't quite ""on"" when they produced this work."
2,Hinda of a ho-hum effort,"When I picked up Fly on the wall many years ago, It was the one AC/DC album that didnt get into my regular rotation. In fact, its just not that good. I know some people really love this album, and some say you have to be a huge AC/DC fan to like this..I will tell ya, I am not a huge fan of the band with the Johnson Days, but love the Bon Scott Era. I do think that Back in Black and The Razors Edge are the best in the Johnson Era (Flick of the Switch aint to bad either) yet this album seems a little dull. There are only a hanful of good songs on this, and it seems like mostly filler material. This might be the worst of all thier albums, yet its not a one star dud, yet since they could have done better, I can only give it 2. This is the AC/DC crapola album"
2,"anh, not so great","This 1985 cd was the second in a duo of self-produced albums by AC/DC. I own the original vinyl record, and have never listened to the cd. It's got some pretty catchy songs on it, but clearly this was the low point in the Australian rockers' career. Here's how it breaks down:1. Fly On The Wall: okay for most bands, but complete crap for the Young brothers. 3/102. Shake Your Foundations: catchy chourus, not much more. 5/103. First Blood: along with back in buisness, best song on album. 7/104. Danger: funny lyrics are the only thing that saved this one. 4/105. Sink The Pink: i have no idea how this song made it as the single on this album. 2/106. Playing With Girls: again, funny lyrics. 4/107. Stand Up: not that bad, but not that good, either. 6/108. Hell Or High Water: crap. 3/109. Back In Buisness: with First Blood, best song on album. 7/1010. Send For The Man: a pretty good song with a good beat and an okay solo. 6/10"
2,"Not so good, but not a total waste","Brian Johnson's voice was practically gone by that time. Also, the production is simply horrible here.The songwriting is good, however, and would make for a good listen, except for the problems mentioned above.The fact is that AC/DC virtually died when Bon died. The guy was simply irreplaceable. He was the missing link that finally launched the Young brothers to stardom. Due to sheer talent, their momentum was so good, the inspiration at a peak, that BACK IN BLACK would have been a success with any singer, be it Brian Johnson or another. That they managed to record album after album after Bon's death, itás a tribute to their quality."
1,Not their best albums,This is one of their worst albums i have about all their albums and didnt really care for this one
5,wonderful,I have a friend who loves music as much as I do. He has been looking for the song Fly on the Wall and I found it I am sure he will be surprised to get it.
4,Great Album Horrible Cover,"I know AC/DC has worked with some of the top producers in rock but I think this is the album that has the biggest sound. This is one awesome sounding album and the songs are excellent.I really believe that if they wouldn't have went with the cartoonish album and videos this would have one of the big ones....not Back In Black or Highway To Hell but it's as good as Black Ice, High Voltage or some others."
5,Awesome.,"This album was very over shadowed by Back In Black and alot of people missed out on it's awesome ROCKin sound and in your face songs. Great album, lots of great solid songs and Johnsons voice is awessome."
4,dont let the bad reviews fool you,"as other reviewers have stated this isn't ac/dc's best album BUT it still rocks hard and is good and consistent and still worth the purchase and even though it gets weak in spots it still has its gems like danger, sink the pink and shake your foundations.basically if what your looking for is good raw no nonsense rock then this is the album for you."
2,Not up to AC/DC's standards,"I still remember how disappointed I was when I first bought this album when it was released. Unlike a lot of other AC/DC fans, I LOVED ""Flick Of The Switch,"" and I anxiously awaited the follow-up. Boy, was I in for a letdown. The problem with this record is, there is just nothing here that grabs you by the throat like on their earlier releases. ""Shake Your Foundations"" is the only song that stands out, if only for the chants of,""AI AI OH!"" The saddest thing about this record, though, is that it was all downhill from here for the boys. Except for a brief resurgence with ""The Razor's Edge"" in 1990, AC/DC was never the same again. Brian Johnson's voice started to go soon after that, and you can only remake the same record so many times before people finally get tired of the shtick."
2,"Last ""good"" Brian vocals for me....","This was thee last semi decent Brian Johnson vocals for me man. As far as I'm concerned, he went down hill after that...until Black Ice. Playing With Girls rawks and I love the lick in Stand Up. Back In Business is another stand out track for me."
2,Not one of the best from AC DC!!!,"Fly on the Wall really divides AC DC career in my opinion...Like many other great rock bands like Rush and Queen, AC DC got their GOLDEN YEARS and the UNINSPIRED MOMENTS... Sometimes Golden years flashes come in the future and sometimes the uninspired moments turns to decades and the bands ends...The late 80's are not so memorable for AC DC...This one and Blow up your video in my opinion are the worst albuns from AC DC!"
3,More than a cookbook,"A good book, but... This was written by two Registered Dieticians. That's probably why the first three chapters (88 PAGES!) are filled with nutritional information and NOT recipes. There are a little more than 100 recipes, divided into Super Quick (15 minutes or less), Quick (35 minutes or less), Do Ahead (muffins and such), and Worth the Effort (more than 35 minutes prep). I don't know about you but, I do not define 35 minutes of preparation as a QUICK breakfast! Having said all that, the recipes are a good mix of grown-up stuff and kid-pleasers... everything from smoothies to casseroles. This would probably be a good book for someone who is stumped for breakfast ideas (beyond cold cereal, toast and coffee) AND wants some nutritional information."
4,Great book! Easy menus,This is one of my favorite cookbooks. My wife and I love to eat italian food. We have a number of italian cook books. The food here is as good as it gets and the preparation is significantly easier.thanks Lidia!
2,TV Show GREAT! Cookbook OK.,"I purchased this book for a friend and he found some of the recipes require too much prep work. I think he made 3 things out of this book before putting it away. On the other hand, we love to watch her cooking shows and get ideas from them. Her TV shows are great. This book is so so."
1,Cookbook Mistake,"I really regret purchasing this cookbook. The format is difficult to read, there are a lot of photos of Lidia's grandchildren which have no meaning to me and the recipes seem complicated. I was so hopeful that the recipes would be relatively simple as Lidia makes cooking on her TV show look so easy.My recommendation is to save your money and stick with Marcella Hazan's ""Essentials of Italian Cooking"". This book is a classic with many wonderful recipes."
3,"MARIE, EAST HAVEN, CT","I JUST PURCHASED LIDIAS BOOK, I HAVE TWO OTHERS AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THOSE, BUT THIS ONE LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED I THOUGHT THERE SHOULD OF BEEN MORE PICTURES OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT. PEOPLE WHO BUY THE BOOK WANT TO SEE WHAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS AFTER BEING COOKED. I ENJOY THE TELEVISION PROGRAMS BUT FELT THERE WAS A LOT LEFT OUT OF THIS BOOK."
4,Lidia's Family Table,My mother-in-law saw her friend reading this book and really wanted it for her birthday. We paid a lot less at Amazon.com than at the local bookstore. She was thrilled with it.
5,One of my favorites,I love her magazine and her cookbooks and view on life. Lidia rocks. Its like your grandmother telling you all the little things you need to know to be a great cook. Thanks Lidia...you rock!!!
5,Excellen resource to know how the actual exam will feel like and how to get ready psychologically for it.,"Must read book before going for the ""Big Day"". After having read the book, I felt mentally prepared for the exam. That went a long way for me in passing the boards. It really smashes the anxiety of the unknown. And that is 90% work done to pass the coveted part-II. Good luck to all fellow-shrinks who are preparing for the exam."
3,A Passable Scare,"Useful, but sets improbable interview standards. Talks about the need to cut time and then goes on and on speaking of minutia to included. Very much a boards approved booster book -- no sense of criticism or irony about the validity and use of the boards, or that it might be useful or the meaning of life for everyone."
4,I passed.,"Used this book mostly for ""this is what you need to say to meet the criteria the examiner is looking for"". I was very glad I has reviewed it, mostly to remind myself (and now you) to include medical casues for what ever the symptom!) - suggest going over it twice, once a few months in advance for ""holes"" and again before the exam for a confidence boost. Good luck."
4,"Julia Child, America's Favorite Chef","The biography of Julia Child was very good. I wanted to see if the movie, Julie and Julia, followed pretty closely. It did! Loved the movie, btw. :)"
3,Not entirely compatible with Windows 2000,"It claims to be compatible with Windows 2000 Professional, but there are some exceptions to this. For example, when I installed it on my machine it wasn't able to set up the proper registry permissions and so it wouldn't work until I found an article on their web site explaining what to change in the registry. Also, to make things worse, it won't work correctly in any account that doesn't have superuser or higher permissions. This is unacceptable in my view as it leaves my users unprotected.By the way, the splash screen that comes up when you start a browser can be easily disabled by going into the ""web trap"" menu."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to reward Trend Micro for providing their excellent, successful, free ""Housecall"" online service so I purchased PC-cillin 2000. I don't know if the software or I am to blame, but here are the facts. After installation, my computer really bogged down. I tried to adjust parameters to eliminate real time searches and screening and my computer became inaccessible. After six hours of heartache, I was able to boot my computer in safe mode and uninstall PC-cillin. My computer has been working fine since then. On a positive note, the company is customer oriented with a year of free email virus news and automatic virus pattern updates for a year. I just wish it had been successful on my computer."
4,A decent mode of protection from virii.,"PC-Cillin does have it's title box show up whenever you move from one online interface to another, but it's unobtrusive and a nice reminder that your protection is there. I had several virii [the plural of virus] enter my system through email. PC-Cillin cleaned almost all of them immediately. Those that could not be cleaned were ""quarantined"" and the program has a nice ""submit"" button that sends them to the maker, Trend. Trend analysizes all of the virii you sent, and emails you a ""fix"" program for those that may have corrupted your system files. It automatically updates while you are online, and if that bothers you, you can minimize it, and let it do its thing unseen. Merely installing PC-Cillin does a virus scan for you. For those who feel they have conflicts with it and Windows startup files, you can turn off the ""Scan on startup"" function. It's a good value, and I have had very good support via email. The voice help, is a toll call though."
1,PC-Cillin 2000 Virus Protection,"Here is a product that I listened to the ratings and have been very disappointed. It has caused my system to lock up on start up and shut down every day. So far, technical support has been most unhelpful. I think that these may be very nice people working there, but very untrained. The support did not go beyond what I had already tried from support online. I was told to uninstall my previous version and reinstall the 2002 version. Only problem was, the serial number that I was given did not work, and so far no one has been willing to supply me with a working number. It's been over a week now that I have been without virus protection and I have had this product for less than two months.I wanted to give this company a try, but so far I am not pleased."
2,PC-cillin antivirus cleaner,"I just got PC-cillin 2000 - in the write up platform it says that it is for Windows ME. When I got it it doesn't say that it is for Windows ME anywhere! If you get it to go on a Windows ME computer, it might not work. I put it on Windows 98. I sort of had a hard time at first. I put it in & nothing happened. I went to Run & typed in the command & nothing. It even locked up my computer & I couldn't get it out. I pushed Ctrl-Alt-Delete & finally got unlocked. I took it out of the CD-Rom Drive & retried it again then it worked without any more problems. It remains to be seen how it does it job."
1,NOT A VERY GOOD SOFTWARE,"I was debating between Norton AntiVirus Software & PC-cillan. I should have stuck with the name brand! Everytime I get on my computer PC-Cillan comes on and interrupts me with an update. If I say ""yes"" it does its download then crashes my computer! I have Windows ""98 Sec. Ed."" If I was you I would stick with the name brands. I told them about it but heard nothing back."
5,"Great Protection, Great Price, Catchy Name!","I've been a PCCillin user for 3-4 years. Each and every upgrade of this powerful virus protection program never ceases to amaze me. It compares dollar for dollar to the highly advertised virus programs such as Norton, McAfee & Dr Solomon's. Get upgrade information and virus update patterns on their user friendly (Easy to Navigate) website. Trend's user support is second to none. Big Protection! Great Price! and hey, a Catchy Name!"
5,Fast,"I have used PC-Cillin for several years now, updating to the 2000 version. The updates are flawless. It has worked well with Win'95, 98,98'2d, and ME.I read some of the reviews listed here and most were in line with how this product performs for myself, perfect. I wonder if the one star reviews were even real? This program has been just great.The biggest selling point for me was speed. This software program works fast. Very fast.There are no interuptions as described in some of the reviews, and unlike Norton or McAfee, it scans quickly.On my 32GB drive times were over two hours with Norton. With McAfee the times were longer! Trends, PC-Cillan ran the scan in 18 minutes.Never a virus with this product, NEVER! And email support on one question was within 24 hours."
3,Better than acceptable.,"I used TDK's CD-Rs a lot before the wide-spreaded of DVD-RW. TDK provides good quality of product, though always a little bit more expensive. This set of product is not in exception. After receiving this item, I felt free when using it, even though it is the era of DVD. If I run out of my CD-R and need to purchase more, I will definitely reconsider this item and order it if still availbe."
1,Disappointing,"I recently purchased this item and burned a CD using iTunes on my Mac. I then took the CD and tried to play it on my stereo. It was nothing but scratchy garbage. So I burned a second CD and repeated the above. The second CD worked. Wow, I've never had this happen. This was with the 100 pack.I read other users feedback and they seem to have had the same problem with more than one disc in a 100 pack. TDK: What's up with your Quality Control/Assurance? I wonder how many usable CDs I'll get in this pack and what my actual final cost will be."
1,Lousy Packing container and Q.A.,"Besides the every other cd being usable, the container is a 2 hand lift. The screw on top works once. Then it will not hold again. Thus, spilling the cds on the floor as the base drops away from the top. Back to sony and verbatim for me."
3,blank CDs,"shipping was a bit slow, and the tracking number didn't tell me where the package was. However I did eventually receive the product."
3,Need a new carrier,Both of my cd spindles were busted and my cd's were all over in the box. Was informed that the ups carrier just threw the box on the porch other then that the cd's work fine
1,Why bother...?,Half these discs would not burn audio. Worst quality in all the years I've been burning music. I recommend Taiyo Yuden 52x CD-R.
2,craptastic,"these disc's have failed. flat out and simple. I'm shying away from this brand due to horrid audio burns.. tried on 4 burner's with the same outcome, best I can get is 4 to 5 normal tracks then it sounds like the tracks are skipping, every second. I will never buy this brand again. My wife and I swore by TDK for years, it seems now their production methods are flawed.however data burns seem to be fine, i have burned a number of dreamcast games and they work fine, or at lest as far as i have played the games.. TDK has lost my trust."
5,Always the best,"I have used TDK blank media of all types my entire life, and have NEVER been disappointed or let down. On the rare occasions I have had to use other brands (not by choice), they are always inferior and have a much higher failure rate (especially considering the failure rate I've experienced with TDK is basically ZERO).I will always stick with TDK, and in the rare instance TDK is not available, I find it's worth it to simply wait until it is.BUY TDK."
3,Alright,"I got this spindle 5 months ago and I still haven't used all of them. I've found less than 10 duds in the pack, but I don't really mind since the deal was so amazing!Bottom line: good bang for buck but some are duds"
3,Good price but poor quality.,"When I buy the 50 pack size they seem okay, but in the 100 packs many skip and some refuse to play entirely. I'll just stick to buying two 50 packs from now on."
1,Do not buy these,TDKs used to be the best.. but I recently bought this stack.. and NONE of them worked or was even recognized by my burner... i have 2 burners and niether of them read these cds... I tried other cds i had left and they worked fine...
1,Squander - Do Not Buy,"Ordered the early version of the this product, the 32x, but got this garbage. I purchased this product from a vendor that advertised this as 32x with product ID:CD-R80M10. According to the vendor, this product is also being sold as TDK product ID:CD-R80M10. I am trying to return the product to the vendor, but the vendor is slow to give me a RMA. After reading numerous reviews, I could tell that this product is not what I wanted before I placed an order. The 32x product used the same TDK product ID, but these are two different CD-Rs, relative to dye formulations. Unfortunately, this is the second time I've had a ""bait and switch"" from TDK. I have reached the conclusion that TDK's advertisements are not to be trusted. You never know what you are going to get from TDK if you use their advertisements as a guide."
2,TDK,"The blank C.D's work great, no problem. When i received the package the case was broken. the top for it was cracked and chipped and the stand that holds the cds in place was snapped right off. Two of the cds were cracked so I had to throw them out and a few others were scratched... Next time package your items correctly."
2,Review of Blank CD Set,"I have bought blank CD's before and this is by the far the worst one I have bought. When I burn songs onto the CD, the CD only burns properly part of the time. As a result, I waste the blank CD's when they don't burn properly since they are completely useless once I have attempted to burn on them. Not only do they sometimes not work properly, but I am not alerted to the fact that the music didn't burn properly until 95% of the burning is already done, thereby wasting my time as well as my CD. This product needs to alert me to the fact that the music won't burn BEFORE it wastes all of my time and blank CD's."
2,cd i ordered,i bought blank CD from amazon and when i got the boc the CD had broken open and were all over the box becus e to not package it properly. you just put it in the box wqith any packing around it. i have ordered blank CD from other places on amazon before and never had this problem. they packaged it preoperly. if it is saying it is coming directly from amazon i will not buy it. i will only buy if it is coming from another seller. i was very disappointed when i received the order.garry moore
2,On sale at best buy,"Just after I got shipping notice, the same item went on sale at Best Buy for $14.00. Win some, lose some!"
3,Very disappointed about made in India CD-Rs!!!,I used to like TDK products when they packaged and sold Taiyo Yuden OEM CD-Rs. The CD-R quality was excellent. I never had any problem. Later they switched to made in Taiwan CD-Rs. Now I found these TDK CD-Rs I received from Amazon.com last weekend are made in India! TDK DVD-Rs are made in Taiwan. :(
2,open package,when i got my package i opened the box and the cds were open they were all over the box inside you need to be more careful when packaging
2,pretty tacky,"baught this as a xmas present, might as well have just waited until i opened my xmas cracker and giving them what ever fell out"
5,renaissance man,"Gordon Parks is by far the most influential man of our time. He has given so much to the world in the form of photography , poems, and literature. He was well travelled and never comprimised himself in the process. I had the pleasure of hearing him lecture with Avery Brooks in NY a few years back. What an experience of a lifetime. Read his works and you will understand his importance in our history"
5,Godon Parks,I am really enjoyed Gordon Parks memoirs. Great historical value. Really enjoyed his style of writting and I highly recommend
4,A hungry heart: A memoir,Very aware of this author because he is my hero so I absolutely love all that he has done in life and art. Thanks
5,Brit police,First time review... great character ... If you enjoy Brit police work Frost is your man. No nonsense kind of guy that always cost him in the end.
5,great,"love this program just wish the dvds where not so expensive so I could buy the other series but being retiredmakes it hard to buy them,as its a great show and really enjoy them"
4,"Recipes, recipes, and more recipes","If you are looking to possess nothing but recipes this is the program for you. However, if nutritional information is a must for you, you should know that this has only a table which lists nutritional information for individual ingredients; not for entire recipes. This is not a difficult program to navigate, which is good because there is no written manual or instructions."
3,Decent,"I bought it just to run basically the same cd I had from way past that will not run properly under Windows7 ... Other than that, wished it had a grocery list builder with it."
1,Does Not Work With MAC,The company stated that this disc is compatible with MAC. When I tried to install the disc it would not install. It is not compatible with MAC.
5,The Best Latin Rap/Reggae,"This album and it's music is perfect.The beats match the songs emotion.This artist is the best rap/reggae singer.This album has all types of emotion like:happy songs,war songs,and love songs.It sticks with the real life.If you are pure latin and you like:El GENERAL,El CHOMBO,NANDO BOOM,and Baby Rasta y Gringo and a little bit of rap you better buy this album it is worth it.This is pure panamanian music.PEACE!"
3,It's okay - the kids have fun with it,"I was excited to get this suite of toys for my 3 year old b/g twins. I remembered having a high chair for my dolls when I was a kid, so I thought that would be great. My daughter is having fun feeding whatever stuffed animal fits in it. My son loves to push the stroller around (at top speed), but the pink wheel caps keep popping off (probably a choking hazard...) The bouncy chair is a joke. The picture of the swing showed a 3-point harness that wasn't included, so the dolls fall out if the swing isn't at just the right angle. The diaper bag is cute, well thought out - the shoulder strap even has velcro on it so that it becomes ""break-away"" if necessary.All that said, my kids are still having fun with it, and it wasn't that much money for the entire package of toys."
1,Bottom line: not worth the money,"Good in theory, disappointing in practice. Seems like this product belongs in a schlock catalog. Device is flimsy -- wobbles, rocks. I need several inches of clearance in order to unlock neck/shoulders; this device sinks too close to the floor. Should be sturdier, perhaps wider. Also, the foam seems cheap, is not entirely symmetrical. I didn't notice in the picture that the top end has a piece of foam as a footer, which seems to add to the wobbles. You can literally place your head up and down several inches without finding the ""spot"" you need. It's not uncomfortable, just lacking structure and thus lacking therapeutic benefit. Disappointing, since it could be a helpful device if better built. (And would still have a healthy profit margin at this price point.) -- I get better results from using a very thick book, onto which I can relax, remain still, and let gravity work."
4,Real-Ease Neck Support Works for the Knitter in You,"I am an avid knitter, working sometimes five hours or more a day on a project. As you can imagine, it will often give me a cramped neck even though I try to keep my knitting at eye level. This neck support helps to alleviate some of the discomfort until I can get to my chiropractor for an adjustment."
1,worthless,This device is no better than a normal pillow. Don't waste your money on this. My husband and I both tried it and found it to be worthless. To top it off the company charges a whopping 30% restocking fee(which is unadvertised)when you return it to them.
1,"Im not impressed, made my neck worse.","I was so excited when I found this. I have neck alignment issues and this looked like the ticket. I was wrong.The image on the product sale page shows the neck resting deeply within the device, with the neck gently hugging the curve of the product. The foam is so stiff it doesn't allow this and it made my neck alignment worse. In fact, the padding is in itself painful after several minutes. Memory foam would be a MUCH better application here as the curve of the device would allow the alignment of the neck to be corrected. The device smells like industrial glue or something.Ive seen ""chiropractor"" reviews here that have to be fake. I cant imagine recommending this to anyone.Additionally, BUYER BEWARE with these sellers. Advantage Medical wont take a return if you open the package, which is a cardboard box in this instance. They also want a 20% restocking fee IF they accept the return plus return postage.Thanks for reading my review of this product."
3,It's okay - not life changing,"I carrying a lot of tension in my neck and right shoulder. I have bouts of minor dizziness and experinece shooting pains if I don't keep up with my physical therapy appointments. I thought this would be therapeutic between appointments. While it is comfortable and I have dozed off while using it, it is equal to just laying on a contoured pillow and sorry to say I did not feel any profound sense of relief or burst of energy."
2,Didn't work for me,"Both my husband and I live with aching necks. No diseases, just tight muscles 24/7. We both tried the product for a couple of weeks and neither got any relief. It actually gave me a headache."
2,Didn't offer neck pain relief,Real-Ease is comfortable to lay on - it elevates your head as if it was on a pillow. But I didn't feel it offered any stretching or relief for my neck pain. I found more relief doing some simple neck stretches.
5,Neck Problems ? Need some relaxation ?,this item is great. My son and daughter-in-law love it so much I'm going to have to order another for myself
2,not as sturdy as we thought,This neck relaxer was OK but pretty flimsy in structure. My husband didn't feel supported by it when putting his weight in it.
4,Real-Ease Neck and Shoulder Relaxer,It does help to relax the muscles of my neck improving my neck posture and also don't feel that huge tension in my neck anymore.
3,Not effective for me,"First, I think this item is way overpriced. It's basically a molded sheet of metal with some foam stuck on it.Aside from that, I didn't find it effective in reducing any tension or discomfort in my neck.I imagine it's intended to use while laying on one's back on a hard flat surface, but how many of us want to do that just to relieve some neck pain.Laying in bed with the neck rest was not possible as the angle was just not right.I'm sending this back."
2,Very Little Benefit - Neck Doesn't Relax,"The Real Ease Neck support provided some help to my neck but nothing more than I get with a good shower. You can't relax completely because your head will roll to one side. That happens because the neck support is not very stable, the base is only 3"" wide and has a foam bottom; it needs a base that is 3 times as wide to hold your head in a stable position.I have had neck and shoulder pain for more than 20 years. I go through ibuprofen by the thousand. This product did not help at all for me.I also purchased the Pike Street Micro Bead Therapy Pillow from Amazon.Pike Street Micro Bead Therapy Pillow with CoverIt is a little strange at first but it really worked. It was also less expensive."
4,Good product,"I like this when I am listening to music through headphones, on my back, with nice support under my head and neck. Not a miracle product, but my neck pain was never chronic, just annoying."
5,Ready for my 2nd one!,"I bought this about 2.5 yrs ago and have used it so much that the foam is tearing a little bit, so I thought I'd check out prices for a new one (glad to see they've come down substantially ;-). It really does relax tight neck and shoulder muscles. I suffer from thoracic outlet syndrome from 15 yrs of sitting at a keyboard making a living (am now on SSD because of the constant pain). Even with strong narcotic pain relievers and muscle relaxers, I still rely on this traction device to easy tight muscles. You won't be sorry if you need this type of relief."
1,great idea but didn't deliver for me,The idea of this is wonderful. As a bodyworker I can say that putting the neck in a position where it can unwind is a great idea. For me personally the curved part that comes out rubs against the bones of my neck and causes a great deal of pain. Will work well for some. Also kind of pricy.
1,I'm one of the disappointed,"Sounds like a wonderful idea, looks like just what I wanted. It might work IF it had a really wide, stable base. You can only use it lying on the floor, or it feels really wobbly. In my case, I used it lying on the bed, and after a while of my neck trying to stay really still, using some muscles I wasn't used to using in a delicate way like that, those muscles tensed up like crazy and triggered a really bad episode where I had a week of complete pain being unable even to lift my head to normal position. I had to walk around with my face towards the floor which felt idiotic. Chiropractor told me he could only do so much fixing while my muscles were irritated like that, and I had to just lie on ice packs a while. Ouch. So maybe this gadget's a good idea and will work for some people, sure didn't for me though. I can't try it again, can't even look at it now without cringing at the memory so I'm giving it away."
1,Worthless,"I have some pretty severe problems with my neck due to having been involved in several car accidents (C-4 thru C-7 discs are affected). I bought this item based on the reviews, and quite honestly, it didn't ""do"" anything for me. You can accomplish the same effect by rolling towels (or something soft) and placing it under your neck while lying on the floor. Save your money...I wish I had!"
4,good product,so far so good. i don't have any of the problems other reviewers have remarked on. It seems to be helping to stretch and relax my neck.
3,it's just ok,"it doesn't relieve all the tension in my neck, but it's not uncomfortable either. I just thought it was going to do more..."
3,Good idea but product a bit flimsy,"I like this product, but it feels flimsy and really unstable. The plastic has an awful lot more flex to it than I would have expected in such a product. My head feels like it is going to fall off to the side because it is so flexible. I like the idea of the Real-Ease, but the plastic isn't durable enough for me to give it a high rating."
3,so so,"Thought this would be a comfortable way to ease neck pain while relaxing in the comfort of your home. It was the talk of the Christmas party, but none of us felt it really offered any relief. Oh well."
4,Neck Support works great...,"As a person who suffers from severe migraines on a regular basis, I can say this is a handy product to have. I try to use it at least once a day to help keep my neck aligned. I recommend it to anyone who has neck and shoulder pain."
1,head and neck relaxer,this item does not meet expectations. It was a waste of money. I thought it would relax my neck but it really did nothing. I would not recommend it for anyone.
1,Neck Ease no money ease,"I bought Neck Ease after seeing it in the Sky Mall mags on planes for the last few years. Finally, I decided to try it. What a waste of time and effort. It does nothing to ease any neck issues. It is nothing more than a hard pillow! I have tried it several times for varying lengths of time, and when I went over 15 minutes, I actually got a stiff neck, that I was able to easily work out. This is a ""no value at all "" item. Not worth any money, let alone $27.99!"
3,Not for me,I could not get comfortable with this item. It seemed no matter what I tried the plastic curved part closest to your neck seems to be right their putting pressure on my neck.
1,HAS HORRID ODOR,"I received mine in a timely manner. Upon taking the piece out of the plastic baggy, it smelled horrible. It had a rotten smell or similar to a skunk smell and almonds combined. It's always a hassle to return, so I sprayed it with febreeze and hoped for the best. I repeated several more times and it still has a slight smell. Amazon offered to take it back, but I'm just too tired from my fibro and pain to pack it up and get a refund. Have not tried it, but I can tell you this, it is way overpriced for the product you receive. It should be $9.95 at most. It's just cheap plastic and foam that is similar to a cheap packing material. I would look for a similar device that is better made. I don't know if I'm the only one that got the product with such an offensive odor, but be warned......"
1,BAD customer experience,"I placed the order on Feb 28, but did not receive the package even on April 12. I called the customer service, and was told that the item has never been shippped, while I do not receive any information about that. Moreover the customer service even don't bother to say SORRY."
5,helpful in relaxing my tight neck muscles,"When I take the time to use this product, it definitely eases the stiffness in my neck. I need to make time to use it more often!"
1,We are too tall to use this,"This item must be placed correctly at the base of the head and under the neck. Correct position is pictured on the box, and the person shown must be quite petite. Our personal trainer, who had not seen one, suggested it, but there was no way she could get it positioned correctly either. The device is way too small for me (5 foot 8 inches), and even more so for my husband who is over 6 feet. We have returned it."
4,neck ease,"I have used this product for many years and it has alweays seemed to help my neck or headaches on some level. This is the second one I purchased in 6 years. Everytime I recommend it to someone, they say it helps."
2,Neck Ease Review,It's not good for my problem which is arthritis of the neck. Neck Ease is very hard and difficult to place in a comfortable position.It is not advisable to sleep with it.
3,It's okay,"I was hoping for more ""relaxing"" effects as promised in it's name. I bought it specifically for the words ""shoulder relaxer"". It helps, but not greatly. Perhaps I should use it more. It's just the times I have used it for shoulder pain and tightness, it didn't seem to do all that much, so I didn't feel like getting it out. It did though help my husband with a headache recently. I too have used it for base of the neck headaches. It does seem to aid in that to some degree, hence the 3 stars instead of 2."
5,I am a Chiropractor and I recommend to every patient.,"I have practiced chiropractic for 28 years and truly wished I had invented the Real Ease. I personally use the device and I have recommended it for practically all of my patients for the last 5 years. At first it may not feel ""good"" for the first few sessions, but that doesn't concern me. There are times that braces on teeth don't feel ""good"" either. The device is designed to help properly restore the normal curve in the neck. I wouldn't recommend using it for anymore than 10 -15 minutes a day. Even though illustrations on the box show it being used while sitting upright, like in an airline seat, as well as while reclining in bed, I feel the device is useful only while reclining on a firm surface (like the floor). I tell my patients to lay on the floor with their calves up in a chair and relax. It is a great way to spend time in prayer, or meditation or to just catch up on some sleep. But, be sure to set a timer for 10 to 15 minutes."
5,TAKE IT WITH YOU....,"I got one of these for my wife when took a hard dive onto the living room floor while cleaning some curtains.... She was in much pain and this little device was the best thing we found for alleviating it.Over the years we BOTH have come to depend on it and it always faithfully gets rid of pent-up stress, especially in the neck, jaw, and back. Indeed, we don't travel without it now.One word of advice; be sure to be patient with this device; it needs time to work - 10 minutes at a minimum IMO. And if you are wondering about quality consider this - yes, the materials are worth a LOT less than the finished product but balancing that is the fact that there is definitely enough quality there to get the job done. If the manufacturer would tweak it by making the base a little wider - say by 1 to 1.5 inches - and providing a pair of washable covers - this product would be a grand slam!"
1,Doesn't really do anything,"I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. He has been in two car accidents and has migraines. We thought this might help. It doesn't. He feels very uncomfortable in fact. My mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either. In fact, if you are short, as my mother and myself are, it doesn't do anything for you."
1,Not pleased.,I have bulging discs in my lower neck that causes the muscles to tighten up. I used this product as instructed and felt no relief what so ever. If anything it just didn't feel comfortable holding my head and neck at all. My opinion is this is another gimmick.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Probably pretty nice for some people, but too pricey to buy for hoping it works.Also rubs on your vertebrae and didn't do anything for my neck after use."
3,Sore neck,I have degenerative arthritis in my neck. Not sure this is the right relaxer but gives good support. Should only be used 15 minutes.
4,It helps,"Have to find the right position and surface, but it does help to alleviate neck and shoulder pain some what"
4,Relaxing,"I found this product to be relaxing, but not a cure from back or neck pain. It might be more beneficial if made from more heavy duty products and redesigned slightly. Despite, these shortcomings, I will use the product at times for its limited benefits."
4,Simple and it works,"Very simple and easy to use. Laying or sitting with my head cradled in this device relaxes tight muscles and/or prevents them from tightening. Between keyboarding, mousing and driving, my muscles get very tight and at times lock up and this device in conjunction with doing the stretches in the book:The Anatomy of Stretchingworks for me."
5,great for neck and head pain,"This is the most ergonomic neck support I've ever used. It allows me to recline in such a way that I feel almost no tension in my neck. Because I suffer from frequent migraines which often begin with neck tension, I can use this whenever I feel the neck pain starting, together with a tiny dose of my migraine medication, and often head off a full blown ""attack."" It's also great for meditation in a reclining position.My puppy recently chewed the styrofoam out of mine, so I'm now compelled to order another, as I really feel that I can't do without it. It's a brilliant product."
3,It's descent,"I really need a good way of stretching out and relaxing my neck, and unfortunately, this is not it. It is nice to keep your neck in place, but it really does not stretch it that well.The box looked like it had been in a hurricane. I would have sent it back, but the product itself was not damaged. Terrible shipping though."
1,Save Your Money,Biggest waste of money.Very cheap feel and not much support.Use a cheap swimming noodle or something similar.
1,not well made,first word that comes to my mind is that its fragile. not strong enough to do what its made for. i would not recommend it to others.
1,Wish I hadn't wasted the money.,"I suffer from neck pain, migraines, tmj and fibromyalgia. If you are in severe enough pain, you are willing to try anything. Unfortunately this product did not offer me any relief at all. I found it awkward, flimsy and uncomfortable. I have herniated discs in my neck, so my pain level may be worse than some. This is in the pile of all the other appliances that promise but don't deliver."
1,Doesn't do much,"I bought this because my neck and shoulder is always tense so I been looking for many neck & shoulder product, this one had a lot of good review so I thought I give it a try. I used it several times and found no difference in my neck and shoulder, I did not feel less tense. Another bad thing is that it is made of cheap plastic and foam, for $30+ I'd expect something a bit better built, but it wouldn't matter if the product works, expect it doesn't really do anything for me."
1,Real-ease neck and shoulder relaxer,"This product does absolutely NOTHING for the neck or shoulders! Save your money! All of the claims, this product, says it will do, are false."
1,Dr Riter's Real Ease,I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND I THINK IS WASTE OF MONEY TO SPEND OVER $40 INCLUDING SHIPPING & HANDLING. THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T HAVE THE HARD SUPPORT AND NOT STABLE IF I PLACE IT ON THE FLOOR. I FELT DIZZINESS AFTER PLACE MY HEAD ON TOP OF THE PRODUCT OVER A MINUTE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
1,Tossed it into the trash...,"Cheap piece of junk.It does seem to relieve stress at the neck, but very unstable and feels like junk.I tossed it after using it one time."
3,"Somewhat Interesting, but possibly superfluous","This collection of academic articles that have varying degrees of relation to any particular area of natural language processing strikes me as pointless.If one wants to get a sense of who is working in this broad field, certainly there are better ways to get at that information than dropping a nice piece of change on a ""Dictionary"". Any decent web search will give results at least as good as this book and certainly cost less.The most valuable asset to anyone who wants to really learn something about NLP is the collection of bibliographies -- many of which mention Manning and Schütze, Jurafsky and Martin or Bishop.This volume is completely useless for the engineer and mostly superfluous for the academic."
1,Not Organic,"I received this by error from amazon instead of the organic pasta. I accepted it because it said organic on the front and I didn't look very carefully at it. I discovered later that the pasta was organic, but the cheese was not. A bit misleading!"
1,Es un asco,"Esta musica es un asco y no deberia de existir solo son unos chavitos idiotas que estudian en la anahuac(no tengo nada en contra de la anahuac ya que yo estudio ahi) El caso es que solo venden imagen y no musica, gracias a grupos como este mexico esta tan mal musicalmente hablando. Ya se que hay gusto para todo pero no manchen oigan otra musica ricky martin o lo que sea pero no mercurio que es pura imagen."
3,My thoughts on Ladies Day Out With The Bonnet Girls,"Having made many applique quilts in the past andwinning blue ribbons I was very excited to receivethis book. It is a real delight to lookthrough, darling pictures. However, I feel theinstructions are very poor and the scenes would beimpossible to actually make. This book will beput on my book case and not used."
5,HEART WARMING MEMORIES,"One number was the MOST rewarding.""THEIR HEARTS WERE FULL OF SPRING"". It was written by Bobby Troup and we played it at his graveside to celebrate the aniversary of his birthday on Oct 18. He's buried next to his wife, Julie London and the lyric ""One day they died and their graves were side by side...they say violets grow there the whole year 'round. For their hearts were full of spring""...brought heart warming memories to friends and family."
5,Outstanding!,Could not be happier with this purchase. All the songs I wanted to hear again by this amazing group. Good quality CD. Thank you very much.
4,good deal,i have this 4 stars because of the cardboard backing kinda cheap but is it worth the price.
3,A Good Read,"This was a pretty good book, depending on how you like your sports book. This is not a chapter-by-chapter review of Terry Bradshaw's career, although he does include brief sections on each Super Bowl. The former star quarterback does give his insights on many issues, however, such as his rocky relationship with Coach Chuck Knoll and his friendship with Art Rooney Sr. There is a lot of good information on the Steelers of the '70s and every fan of those teams should enjoy this book."
3,Interesting toy!,"Hello, my name is Kelli, I bought these sea-monkeys in hope of a decorative touch to my room, and some fun. The florescent color of the container isn't helpful at all, it just makes it even harder to see the tiny sea-monkeys. But i enjoyed experimenting with the sea diamonds, they're really interesting. I'm not sure how long the sea-monkeys will last, because i've only had them for a week, but they seem healthy and strong. I recomend this toy to younger children whom aren't allowed to have pets, but want one. I'm not really sure how to take care of them, so if you happen to know information on how to care for these sea critters, please write another review explaining for me. Overall, these little adventurers are quite fun."
4,Sea Monkeys are for young and old,"We gave this Sea Monkey kit to our grandson who is in kindergarten (age 6). Kids of this age appear to be greatly interested in animals and this is one that they can handle with adult supervision, which is very important in getting it set up. The child can do the maintenance work such as introducing oxygen into the small tank (by stirring) and also the occasional feeding that is necessary once or so per week, as indicated in the instructions. Initially there is not a lot you can see but the little things grow up to be quite visible. They may be more interesting to look at under a microscope or small magnifier, as there are both males and females of this brine shrimp species."
2,Snobby and Stereotypical,"This novel, like many of Palmer's novels is a page-turner, but he ruins a good story with his (1) snobby characters (""it's Doctor Solari;"" a doctor character tells another doctor character that the police will have to believe two medical degreed people; professional characters are attractive, ""non-degreed"" characters are fat, have ferret features, etc), (2) stereotyping (security guards are always brutes or dolts or neanderthals; waitresses are always overweight and chew gum; his good guys don't have flaws; his bad guys are ridiculously evil and overly dramatic) and (3) terrible dialogue (way too predictable). So despite a good story, like his previous novels, the shortcomings noted above take his novels down a couple of pegs for me. And he's done this in the last several novels. I gave him one last chance, but I'm done with him now."
3,Did anyone catch this pun?,"""Maybe he can order some sort of toxicology on the tissue. 'I'm still certain the mine is at the bottom of all this.'"" These words were spoken by the brilliant doctor, Dr. Matt Rutledge in Dr. Palmer's book. The other reviewers have captured the essence of this book admirably...it is an exciting read. But...a line like that? I searched the page to see if it was spoken tongue-in-cheek. Without a wink, this groaner had me wondering about the editor!"
4,One of his better books.,"Fatal is one of Michael Palmer's better books, although I have to say the ending was a bit of a let down. For anyone who enjoys medical dramas, this book is for you. Palmer leads you on a trail believing the problem is one thing, then the plot twists and you realize it's a completely different issue. There were quit a few characters and plot lines yet they all came together quite nicely."
4,"Good, but not his best","This was a good read. Some of Palmer's other work has been terrific, but this one is ""merely"" good. It is suspenseful, and a pageturner"
4,It has everthing,"This book was a thriller, who-done-it, suspense, action (would be a good movie), romance and humor. Typical MP, it is a medical mystery too."
5,FATAL,MICHAEL PALMER'S BOOKS ARE ADDICTIVE.YOU CAN'T READ JUST ONE! THIS BOOK WAS A BOOK I COULDN'T PUT DOWN FOR VERY LONG AT A TIME. KNOWING A LOT OF THE MEDICAL TERMS REALLY KEPT ME GUESSING. I FELT AS IF I WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE STORY. WHAT AN EXCELLENT BOOK.
1,Failure to connect,"The novel started off very well, creating a lot of suspense and an eagerness for the reader to find out what is the possible link between the two stories ( the autism causing vaccine and the toxic mine ). However, except perhaps to someone who is ignorant about biology, the author fails to fully explain the presence of prions in the vaccine. What are prions doing there in the first place ? I didnt know that prions were a basic element in a vaccine. Secondly, the vaccine was created with the intention to protect not to kill. So, it doesnt make sense at all."
4,Not his best.,"&#65279;One of the great things about Michael Palmer is that he does not feel he has to pump out a book every year, if it is good or not. So when I learn he is putting out a new book I really look forward to it. This book around I just did not feel the need to read every free second I had, like I did with The Patient. Fatal has likeable characters and brings up some things that will make me think next time I take my kids to the doctor, but it just didn't grab me like his earlier novels. It is worthreading and I believe most people will find this book enjoyable."
3,Good Book,"Not one of the best I have read, but I was compelled to read it based on a ""hot topic"" it discusses. The book can very well be reality in today's society. It is sad and scary, but it is very very well written and hopefully, will open up some ""closed eyes"" to this dangerous situation. It is a good book."
3,not the best thriller ever,It's not a masterpiece but it makes you reading this to the end. What prevented me from giving this four stars is the singlemindness of the author in regards to the very complicated problem of vaccines and his obvious antipathy towards corporations. It's too black an white. Other than that it's well done medical thriller.
4,I didn't realize how huge this would be,"I read all the reviews for other slow-cookers and decided on this one.It is huge.Next time I use it I will keep it on the 'low' setting. The 'high' setting is only needed to get things started - and I didn't realize that until afterwards. The high setting it just to high and leaves a cooking residue the side.Great crockpot - three settings, huge and easy to clean."
4,Loufa's Kitchen,"This is the first slow cooker I've ever owned. Nice quality for the price, generous capacity, 3 settings (high, low and warm). No timer, though, and it would be a big plus if it did have one. I recommend it highly but buy it with the timer so that you can leave the house and not worry about rushing home to turn it off. Reduces fat consumption since no pre-frying is necessary. Slow cooking seems to be making a big comeback and I understand why now that I own one."
5,FINALLY a slow cooker that is truly slow,"Everyone is right about this slow cooker. It is the only one of dozens I have investigated that does not boil food on low. A slow cooker is USELESS if it does that! This one is just wonderful. Best food I have ever made, and it is all because of cooking at 170 degrees instead of 200. If only it were programmable. But that is a small wish compared to having it WORK PROPERLY! This just goes to show it is possible to manufacture something both cheaply and properly."
5,"Great product, great price","I wasn't sure what to expect from this slow cooker, and I was very pleasantly surprised.Everything I have cooked in this thing turned out great! And the ""warm"" feature is great for when my husband gets home later from work. The kids and I have eaten, but his food is still warm and ready to go.It's super-easy clean because the crock lifts out of the cooker.I would definitely recommend this crock pot."
4,first slow cooker I've owned,I bought this based on all the good feedback from the review section. I am happy with it - although it is my first one. The size it perfect. The temp settings seem to be consistent. I am very satisfied. The dishes are very tasty!
4,Larger capacity than expected,"This crock pot is the closest thing that I have found to the heat range of older crock pots. It will not overcook your food like most newer crock pots. My only concern is that it seems much larger than a 5 qt., but other than that it works very well with no problems."
5,Wonderful Holiday Album,"As someone above stated, this is not exactly something you can download off iTunes if it wasn't for amazon I don't know where I'd get it. This album is dripping with nostalgia as I remember all the songs from my childhood. I absolutely love the album. My favorite song is the the Silver Bells song by A Few Good Men. It's probably my favorite version of Silver Bells period."
2,Dead as a door nail,"Used infrequently while traveling, in lieu of a laptop. Dead as a door nail in 7 months. Thankfully it's in warranty, but unfortunately all data is lost. Will likely be replaced by a reconditioned product per Palm warranty ... and that reconditioned product will only be warrantied for up to 90 days, regardless of the warranty period left on the original.I chose Palm because of its reputation, but I'm disappointed with this product and wish I chose the iPAQ instead. After all the Palm add-ons, etc., it would have cost about the same.I won't be purchasing another Palm product again."
1,piece of junk,"The Lifedrive is an absolute ripe off. It's no wonder it cannot be purchased on the Palmone web site. It's like having a regular pda with 64MB of storage attached to an uncooperative 4GB SD card. Most third party software doesn't recognize this space, therefore it's difficult to download directly the this extra storage and the device space limits what you can transfer there. The moblie manager allows you to drag and drop files directly into the Lifedrive area, but then you can't find them. It crashes often, gets hot during use, and you have to buy the sync cradle separately. It come with a ""sync cord"" that causes the unit to fall or get knocked off the work station. The ""hard case"" is a piece of thin,flimsy. tin with rubber on the back. The unit is slow, and difficult to work with. It's like having dial up in your palm. I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a product. I'm sending my lifedrive and that worthless tin case back for a refund."
1,Class Action Lawsuit,"After suffering with every problem listed in the reviews on this product I am wondering if anyone is aware of a class action lawsuit against Palm for this product which is not acceptable for the purposes for which it is to be used.Within 60 days my Palm froze and I had to send it back. I too got a ""refurbished"" unit which I couldn't understand. $500 and it dies in 60 days and you don't get a new one?Then the new one is doing ok, little by little I add software and I am starting to think ok this is good. Then I get on an airplane and try to plug in my headphones. The socket is loose and moves around so much I have to hold the jack just right to make it work. So this one is going back and I will have to go through the whole thing again.Wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it. Anyone have any notions on getting to Palm?"
1,Buy at your own risk,"I won't re-hash the issues that others have experienced. However, be forewarned that, if you do purchase this device, think twice about installing Software Update 2.0. There have been LOTS of problems with this update. It rendered my device completely unusable, and after returning the device to Palm for repair (which didn't correct the problem), and three subsequent calls to Customer Support, it still isn't working properly."
2,"""LIFE PRESERVER NEEDED""","This PDA for the money needs several drastic improvements! No camera for one. The wireless network, and the keypads from caps to lower case is a real exercise and extremely slow.Overall, I would not rebuy this PDA. I have found that it was not worth the $500 and a much lesser version of Palm would suffice!"
1,Wasteful investment,"Honestly, buying the lifedrive is one of the worst investment that i made. Mine died down for no apparent reason. I should have not bought any palm device anymore (that was the third one). I'm thinking on buying a windows based device soon for my clinical practice. Everything about the lifedrive is disappointing. I will never recommend it to anyone."
4,Enjoying learning about features,"This PDA had so much memory and so many features, I discover something new every day. My previous (and first) PDA was the very basic Z22. I had no idea that a PDA could have the capability of the Lifedrive. This really is the closest thing to carrying around a laptop. I am enjoying all of the bells and whistles of the Lifedrive and have hit no major snags yet."
1,Mine also died and will not reset,"My Lifedrive died after a year and will not reset. I've tried the soft reset, hard reset and hard reset with the Lifedrive charging in its cradle. Palm support is non-existent. They gave a lame suggestion (the hard reset in the cradle) when I first contacted them and now they have not responded to my follow up message. In addition the form on their website to request support has stopped working. I have to say the address book was really handy and it was useful to be able to read e-books on the PDA. However, I can't possibly recommend getting a Lifedrive because of the poor support and the danger of losing important data which cannot readily be transferred to a non-Palm PDA even if you have been doing regular synchronizations with a desktop computer."
1,LifeDrive,"Palm Lifedrive Mobile Manager (Refurbished)The device I received would not take a charge. I returned it, and my money was promptly refunded."
1,Died and will not reset,"After a year, the Lifedrive froze while starting up. I tried resetting, including several hard resets, which the unit would never complete. A call to Palm Tech Support did no good - they want me to send it back for repair (at my own expense, since it's past the warranty period)."
1,not worth the money,"it holds a lot of information/books etc, and therefore makes a great reference if you are a professional, travel, etc. Also, it is quite good at finding access to the internet. Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of others. It's hard drive has broken after 6 months of use. Now its a great paper weight!"
1,Junk!!!!,"Well...I am on my 4th and soon to be on my 5th...thank God for an extended warranty from Staples...since I have had mine, It has either been sent off or broke down. I was a loyal Palm user but the life drive is a pure piece of tech. junk...steer clear!!!"
1,nothing but a paperweight,I purchased the lifedrive to use at work and at home. Well I have had it for 7 or 9 months and now it will not work. Nothing more than a paperweight. It shows that it is charging but it never charges to completion. It will not turn on even when you dock it to your computer. I have tried the reset button to no avail. My lifedrive is dead in less than a year. I'm looking for a replacement and I'm currently looking at the HP 2495 or 2795.
2,Very unstable device,"First of all, I bought it as my first palm device very excited because everything it was supposed to do. And finally after trying everything and consulting with forums over the Internet I have to say it's a very unstable device. It resets all the time and for no reason, no matter what soft you are running...Besides this, that it's already a non-purchase recomendation, it has a poor battery life if you use wifi, and if you don't use it, it has a poor performance too...Don't believe when people tells you the unstability of the device is cause of the soft you are running. It crashes no matter what you are running, and anyway is not the idea that you have to be studying what soft you install in your device.I am very dissapointed with this device and I don't recommend to buy it."
3,Nice Start,"I think overall that it's a good one. But there are 2 things i don't like about it.1-poor battery life, especially after using the WIFI for a while.2-it crashes sometimes while surfing the net."
2,Some might like the LifeDrive,"If you are a ""newbie"" Palm user who never installs 3rd party software and who uses only basic stuff, you might like the LifeDrive [but then you might not need one].If you are a ""sophisticated"" Palm user, then you will soon find out that the LifeDrive has way too many serious problems which interfere with using it.I wish I could recommend a better Palm but the Tungsten C is the only one I like, and it no longer seems to be available."
4,3 yrs and still going.....,"I've had my LifeDrive since it came out and love it. Sure, the wifi is slow but I don't use it that often. I imagine the newer models are faster if you really need it for the internet. I have had times when it froze on me but I was able to track down the fixes on the discusssion groups and get it going again. The problems were usually caused by my installing incompatible software. I just recently lost the ability to use the stylus for input making the unit unusable. But I kept messing with it with resets and reboots and was finally able to get the stylus setting software to take the input and it's working great now. I know that it's just a matter of time tho as none of these things last forever and I was sad to find they aren't making it still. Guess I'll have to go for the TX when at last my beloved LifeDrive dies."
2,Still needs a lot of improvement,"I bought this PDA and had to return it after 10 days. I was dissapointed with: the slowness of the processor, the very poor battery life, poor sound quality of the MP3 player and the voice recorder. I am planning on replacing it with the T/X. Do not spend your money on this PDA. Wait, i am sure next generation PDA with big storage capacity will improve on the flaws that this one has."
4,Too many problems with WiFi at the begining,"At the begining there were neccesary two hard resets to being able to connect to internet thru WiFi, finally y downloaded a firmware update and actually is working Ok, however sometimes for ,I do not know why some times it does not recognize a particular hot spot.It is wonderful to have 4GB to carry all your stuff.The mobile works slower than my previous TX.Now, after two months using it I am 80% satisfied."
2,Life Drive great concept - poor software reliability,"The Life Drive - with lots of disk storage - is a great product concept with extremely unreliable software. Unlike the Palm IIIx and earlier models with the rock solid Palm operating system and Graffiti handwriting recognition, the Life Drive frequently locks up and crashes. The Grafitti 2 software has very poor recognition (as well as being less intuitive than original Grafitti), runs slowly, and often cannot recognize ""T"" and ""L"". With an unreliable digitizing pad (which causes characters to breakup and be read as other characters), text entry is an exercise in frustration; on average characters must be entered twice. Mine is being returned for repair for the 2nd time in 18 months but it has never operated anywhere near satisfactorily."
4,Finally - something that can do it all,"I had previously owned a Palm Zire 71 and liked it but it was very limited by its small memory capacity. The Life Drive has 64 mb of memory in addition to a 4GB hard drive. It is fantastic - I love the screen resolution and the ease of downloading picture files, music and documents. Wifi is super easy to use and has nice graphics - unlike the Palm TX. It can be viewed in the vertical or widescreen mode, which is great. Nice size screen too. Battery life is not the greatest, but who wants to look at a small screen for more than an hour at a time anyway? I love the lock mechanism, ensuring that it can not turn on by itself during transport. SUPER HAPPY with this PDA. One small drawback is you will need to buy a case or skin as their case is super tight and not easy to get off."
1,Lifedrive Not SO Good,I bought this item because of the 4 gig hard drive. It was priced at $436.00 new. The OS crashed the first day I used it. It then crashed at least twice a day there after. I figured that the item I got was defective. PALM stated the the hard drive was messed up. Amazon did a quick return and I purchased another. To my disappointment the second one did the exact same thing. I read several reviews and it seems that 1 out of 10 Lifedrives actually works good enough that you can depend on it. I heard recently that there is some sort of class action lawsuit against Palm over this item. Anyhow I returned it to Amazon again and now use a notepad that fits perfectly in my pocket. I recommend that you stay away from this product unless you can get it for under $75.00Good Luck!
1,Read This...,"I was considering buying this seemingly ""cool"" product because my friend had one. My friend used to bring it to work but that lasted only for a month. Why? It froze.I was lured by the manufacturer's presentation of its specs but I knew that they were only deceiving me. Most of the cool stuff featured are the ones that customers of Amazon are complaining about. My opinion is based on the 117 reviews on Amazon. I have painstakingly read every one of them. I have noticed that the customers who gave high ratings are the ones who have been using their Lifedrive for less than 4 months and/or those who have never experienced a major crash yet. Wait till they do.I have read all the reviews on Palm T|X and I am convinced that this indeed, outperforms the Lifedrive."
2,What is all the hype about?,"I am surprised at all the noise this new, yet to be seen, device is making. Let me comment on the main selling points I have read:Wi fi and Bluetooth, sorry folks, HP got there first, the Ipaq 3715 has been offering this since last year.An integrated hard drive, what is the point when you can buy 2GB SD cards (with 5GB coming soon)?Cheaper than the Ipaq 4700, yes but you do not get that gorgeous screen.Finally, as an ex-very loyal Palm user, I am sorry to say that the hardware produced by Palm in the last few years was (to put it politely) not impressive. Just read the user comments on any of them.My advice, have a second look at the Ipaqs."
1,Sad performance,"I thought it was another great palm product...boy I was wrong. The unit is slow, it crashes constantly, it doesn't turn off.please be cautious, don't buy it without testing it. It worked fine for one week and then problems started.I was a fan of palm products for 7 years. never again. I feel cheated."
4,More than a PDA,"With a huge capacity and an ability to open documents and adobe files, it enabled me to carry all my documents and some books, which are PDF, with me and made my life easier. As a doctor, resources are plentifull and the ability to have them in hand all the time is very helpfull. I tried the music player and discovered an excelent sound quality with headphones, bad with the speaker, but still better than cellphones. I waited a long time for it to be available and I am enjoying it."
1,Better as a paperweight,"I had this little device for less than a year. I was very excited to buy, hoping it would help keep me organized. The GUI would freeze on me and after a while it stopped turning on or refused any inputs. It is not very compact either at about an 1.5"" thick with a case."
1,Dissapointed and dissatisfied,"I bought the Palm Life drive through a vendor on Amazon in January 2010. I have been having problems and am unable to use this device. I talked to Palm and they said the device is obsolete and do not support or repair it. When I bought the palm it was never mentioned that this device had not been manufactured for a couple of years. It was bought new, so not much good to say about it lasting one year before a major breakdown. Bob"
1,terrible device,"I'm had palm products for over 8 years and was excited to try this one. it sucks! it was horrible; I couldn't downloan my usual programs that I use every day, I couldn't get the preloaded stuff to work, it skipped around, it froze; I had to do mutiple hard resets a day -it was all around awful!choose something else!!pathetically, palm failed big on this one!!!"
4,Great but Slow,"The Lifedrive is a great device, but after using the T3 this seems a little slow, especially after a reset when it does the equivalent of a CHKDSK on the internal Microdrive. Other than that it's a nice device, fits well in the hand and still fits in my shirt pocket."
3,Dissapointed,"This is my second palm pilot. The first worked fine but my second palm pilot purchased only 2 months ago has to be returned because it simply stopped functioning yesterday. Since the beginning this product had a problem. It never connected to interenet, and it dn't synchronize with my excel documents."
1,World record broken --lasts only 1 hour!,It worked great until it died. The first LifeDrive died after 4 days. It just turned off in the middle of something and wouldn't turn back on (even with the battery fully charged) The second LifeDrive lasted only 1 hour. It froze up after hot synching it and won't unfreeze even after resetting. I'm not going to give them a third chance -- its a lot of money for such poor quality!
2,for US500 you better buy a lap top,"The price is not right, when a toshiba lap top, with 40GB, WIFI goes for 600 dollars paying just 100 less for a mere 4 GB is absurd."
3,Very Glitchy,"When I recieved this LifeDrive, the first thing it required me to do was to reset it. I did, reluctantly, and when it began to start up again, it would ""No notice"" reset itself again. I was forced to hard-reset it in order to begin using it. This happened to me many times, including when I was in a meeting. Now, it won't even boot up. However, when it was not glitching, I found it very satisfying. It had an endless supply of memory, and I could store whatever I wanted-even if it wasn't compatible with the Palm OS-via the ""Life Drive Manager"", or ""Drive mode"". The graphics were superb, but many times I was not able to experience it fully because of the noticable lag. Another thing I noticed was that soft resetting it took longer than a Windows machine to boot up.There are many superlatives about this product, but wait a while for the firmware to be upgraded, because the OS included with this program is very glitchy."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This product is not at all what I had hoped for. After using the Palm Tungsten T5 and being a loyal follower of all of the Palm line, I was excited to receive this product. That excitement went south in a hurry. Initially, the product is about half again as bulky as the Tungsten, but that wasn't a big deal. The synchronization process was slower than the Tungsten's, but again I could deal with that. The sticking point when the thing locked up 4 times in one morning. After that I returned it immediately and bought a Palm Tungsten TX from another supplier."
2,Lag Drive,"I purchased this in june and had to return it. I use it as a physician and have had a Tungsten C, and Visor and Palm V, each of which represented continuous improvement in speed and usability. The lifedrive was so slow switching between applications, up to 2 minutes and usually thirty to 90 seconds that I couldn't function. Also the programs I used ran more slowly (10-20 seconds for steps that were instantaneous before) than before or than on the T|X with which I have replaced it . Iuse a prescription program and it links to epocrates which meant every time it would take several minutes to perform a task that took 10-20 seconds previously.On the plus side the multimedia and PIM functions worked well if you waited for them to start. It has a sharp screen and pictures. The dictaion feature was great."
2,Dead Life Drive.,"I purchased a Life Drive PDA because of the large memory capacity. I upgraded from Sony Clie. I have been unable to get any help from Palm, since my Life Drive crashed after a long holiday weekend. I guess the battery ran down and it will not recharge. A $500 device that is now useless. I have now returned to using my Sony Clie which continues to work. If I were you I would think twice about buying such an expensive PDA that does not contain replaceable batteries. Take a look at Palms website where they tell their customers that sending the device back could cost you more than the amount it would cost to buy another. ""Let the buyer beware!"""
1,Extremely Poor Customer Service,"I bought the lifedrive brand new and within 2 months my lifedrive stopped working even though I did everything to take great care of it. ie buying the hard caseThen after calling the non-toll free customer service number and paying for shipping & insurance to send the product back to Palm - its been about 4 weeks and still have not received my lifedrive back yet and getting the run around with the customer service individuals at Palm who were rude and arrogant when asked for a credit instead. For example, one of the individuals said, ""do you honestly expect to get help from anyone at corporate on this issue"" - enough said."
4,EXCELLENT product with few minor drawbacks,"This is an excellent product. PROS: I love the 4GB memory and the capability of running larger programs which I couldn't run on my Sony Clie or my Palm Zire. Very well built. User friendly. Excellent graphics (probably the best in the market). The infra-red, Bluetooth and Wi-fi features are definitely useful.Drawbacks: it is slightly bigger and probably heavier than most PDA's. Can't multi-task, especially with large programs. Running music in the backgroud will slow it down even more. looses battery life fairly quickly if you use the internal speaker. lacks an internal camera.Overall, I love this unit and I highly recommend it :-)."
1,4GB but the worst quality I have ever seen,"Too many crashes in one single hour of using it.A PDA should be a productivity booster device. Counterwise, Life Drive has made me waste more time in one week than ever.Hotsync crashes, Documents to go crashes, WIFI crashes, Batery life go down quickly with WIFI, when it crashes.I definitively need to know the way for getting my money back from Amazon."
3,Disappointment is growing,"I purchased a Life Drive just over a year ago. Tried to hot sync when I got it home with no success. Returned it to place of purchase, and they couldn't get it to hot sync either, so they replaced it. Took it home and successfully hot synced the device. Loaded contacts, calendar events, an Excel spreadsheet, and an outside software program that I had successfully used on my last handheld. Within six months, the device was not hot syncing. Device started freezing up, and having to be reset, then jumblimg information, ending in a complete lock-up of the device. At this point, I can get to the home page, and nowhere else. Doesn't bode well for me when I go onto the Palm website and no longer see the Life Drive available for purchase."
1,"It looks great, but...Don't do it!!!","I LOVED my LifeDrive for the 7 weeks it functioned. They replaced the unit. Only to find that the second died after only one hour. One stuck in a loop, the other just froze. Tech support is always friendly, but can give me no solution but to offer another. I don't want it. I even offered to take a ""lesser"" model...and stay a Palm customer (as I have been for 10+ years)...but it does not fit into their procedure. It is the last Palm product I will ever own...and a costly $500 mistake to have a cool PDA for 7 weeks of operation. DON'T DO IT!!!"
1,Life Drive = Life Support,"Well, after owning 4 Palm devices, My palm days might be behind me.I bought this device on a Friday, and charged it. On Monday I setup the hotsync, enababled all of my Entourage data, set up the Blue Tooth, and used it for one day. Wireless working perfectly everthing great!! Got home on Monday evening turned it on and it got stuck at the Palm Screen. Followed all tech support advice. Called in and went through a erase device procedure and its still erasing, 2 hours later.I'm returning it tommorrow. Nice unit, but so far very unreliable."
4,Looking good...,"...but how about a price. Other than that, this device looks good and if the May 18th release date really does come about then this will be a big step forward for PalmOne, making them somewhat of an inovator, however Tapwave still reamins the top current inovator for design. Lets hope PalmOne gets this device released ASAP and lets hope it is popular. I think it may be my next PDA."
4,Great Device,"I made this purchase to replace the three year old Life Drive I've been using. I love the device, but unfortunately the one I received was defective and no more items were in stock. Trendsavvy was quick to send me a refund; including my shipping cost. I'd recommend this seller."
3,Not the Best Nor the Fastest,"If you are caught between a TX and a Lifedrive--go with the TX. While the LifeDrive has more room, it is lacking in speed when compared to the TX. The TX is seamless when switching between applications. The LifeDrive will hang and freeze, when switching between applications, for what will seem like an eternity no reset is needed--just patience. Many claim that the system has hard reset many times, wiping out the internal memory, in the time that I've owned it, this has not happened. Ranking order for those wanting a Palm device: LifeDrive is good, E2 is better, TX is best."
2,Palm LifeDrive Mobile Manager - watch out,"Unstable, terrible battery life, slow between apps, protective sleeve is clumsy to use.I traded it for the TX."
2,Palm has the absolute worst customer service,"I've ran into problems HotSyncing my Palm LifeDrive with Mac laptop and have tried four times now to get through to Palm customer service for assistance without any luck yet. I've held on the phone for over 45 minutes each time listening to their crummy music only to have my call abruptly disconnected. It's sad that most companies don't offer good, easy to reach customer service, but Palm manages to out do everyone else in their absolutely horrible customer service."
5,Excellent book,"I have read literally hundreds of fishing books and this one is the best-bar none. I have given my copy to several of my fishing buddies and all agree there is no book like this one when it comes to practical information, told in an easy to understand manner. Joe goes through it all from tuning crankbaits, to proper tackle selection, to techniques for the use of crankbaits to catch all of the ""big 4""--walleyes, bass, pike and musky. This book is the best!"
5,very sparkly!!!,"beautiful, I wear them all the time and with anything!. They pick up what ever color you are wearing, great!"
5,Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver Earrings,"I think they are just beautiful, and I gave them for Christmas gifts. They were so pleased to have such a fine piece of jewelry.I purchased from Amazon as I did the Cool Daddy, also for a Christmas gift. My son, and his children couldn't wait to try it, said the shrimp were perfect.Kathryn E. Scanlon"
3,they look better in the picture,I added these to my wish list and received them as a birthday gift. they look better in the picture.
2,"""Clear cristal"" is a lie!","Beware that 2 sides of that cube are tinted. There is a metal-like coating that creates that rainbow sparkle, and it makes the earrings look plastic and cheap.Other than that, they are well-designed."
3,Streling ear ring review,At first I was diappointed- I expected them to look like pictured- They don't- But ofter putting on a blouse- They do pick up some color- But not as pictured. I will keep them-The quailty is good for the price & the packaging & time of arrival was great- I will buy more items & recommend seller-
5,Beautiful!,"I bought these earrings for a Christmas gift, but when I saw them, I couldn't give them up. I wear them all the time. They just go with everything and are of a great quality. I may order more for gifts. Would definatley recommend them."
5,eternal light,"Most if not all of Swarovski crystals are like prisms. they hold up to wear, clean nicely, and always shines in the lights. box protected them and was not damaged. I felt the cost was just right for me. The leverbacks are so easy to put in with out any mirrors or help. Have many pairs and not one had any prolems ...."
4,by far the best of the six swarovski crysal earrings i bought,"I bought six earrings for myself and my sisters over xmas. all crystals in different colors from this seller. i bought 4 tear drop crystals in blue, pink, green and clear, this earring, and another one similar one to this - sensational clear. this earring is by far the best buy. it catches the light charmingly and is long enough to be seen past the hair.i would say don't buy the other colored crystals, buy this one or the other earring which is similar in design and clear... they really are pretty and seem to dance in the light. my sisters loves them."
3,very small,"good very pretty, a gift for my mon but very very small. its not a bad prooduct 100 % Swarovski..."
4,earring review,"Beautiful pair of earrings, had many compliments on them. Would like to view more like them in the future. Thanks"
4,Swarovski Crystal earrings,I was hoping these earrings would have had more color in them like the picture. But they are clear. Disappointing but they are still pretty.
4,"Beautiful, but hard to put on","I wish when they designed the hoop portion that the part that goes through the ear was somewhat straighter so that you could put them on more easily. It took me a good 5 minutes to get them on by myself. Otherwise, I love them once they are in the ears."
5,Islam and the Blackamerican: Essential Reading for whites or blacks,"Sherman Jackson has delivered a powerful piece on the history and current situation of religion in the Blackamerican community. Jackson dispels some myths as to why Islam has found such popularity in the Black community. He also provides poignant insight into the nature of how Islam has come to operate in the West. Alternative choices are outlined and provided to the Black community in reconciling with their uniquely Black and Western heritage. I cannot recommend the book enough. A must read for anyone who has religious, social or anthro-social interests."
1,Can anyone record and album and should they?,Simply unreal. This recording really should not have ever been made. This has to be a vanity recording.
4,Good Book Club Book,"My book group sustained a spirited discussion of A Match to the Heart. Some found Ehrlich's exposition seriously lacking the heart she writes about, while others were satisfied that we weren't going to get to know Dr. Blaine Braniff, cardiologist, any better. All of us appreciated the very fine writing. Ehrlich's intricate metaphoric musings make this a great selection for a book group looking for non-fiction focused on nature, the human body, a little Buddhism, and a dog named Sam"
1,desapointed,"I was expecting the two volums, or that it was better specified that it was just the second volum."
4,Better Effort,"The sophomore effort by the former background dancers for MC HAMMER gave them much more creative control and writing credits. The lead single ""Turn it up"" was a dance hit and a top 20 r&b; and rap song. It featured the legendary TATA VEGA on vocals. ""Its not your money"" is a clever song about how people find out you have money and wanna take advantage of you. ""(Miss You) Come back to me"" is a rap ballad featuring B Angie B on the hook.""Honey"" was another stand out single for the group. ""Thats why we're doing it"" and the stomping banger ""Comin' Harder"" were also just as competent. This release is more Oaktowns 357 on their own. MC HAMMER produced this effort as well but the songs are more well rounded."
4,"Hot, steamy, and helpful","First of all I must say that the photography is wonderful. The people are beautiful and seem very happy in every pose. The book is very clear, easy to read and more importantly easy to follow. The small size of this book is handy to transport around your house or to your hotel room. This book is excellent but if you have a little more money to spend, and are not afraid of your children finding it, buy Hooper's Sex Guide. It has larger pictures and more postions than the pocket guide but both books are great reads and even better learning tools."
3,Almost useless,"If you are more than a casual AC/DC fan than you didn't even purchase this one- you had all these tracks on the original Australian CDs already. If you didn't have these then you aren't really a big fan of AC/DC. Don't get me wrong, the songs here are all great early AC/DC, but this is just a compilation and not a great one at that. Where are School Days, Crabsody in Blue, Fling Thing, Cold Hearted Man, Rock In Peace and the rest of the missing Aussie tracks? They should have at least extended this thing for the CD release to make it full length and truly worthwhile, but they didn't, therefore I have no use for this thing. Although I have RIP, School Days and Crabsody in Blue on CD I'd still like to have Cold Hearted Man and Fling Thing on Cd- not just crackly LP. A real chance to do something nice for fans but Atlantic blew it big time. None of these tracks are even on Bonfire!!!! What kind of stupidity is that? They just give us a concert that we all had on bootleg anyway!"
4,Quality over quantity,"Released in 1984 as the band was working on their next album, Fly on the Wall, '74 Jailbreak is a 5-song collection recorded with original lead singer Bon Scott during their infancy. This is AC/DC at their most raw and that's saying something. Everything here is very good from the cutting ""Soul Stripper"" and ""You Ain't Got a Hold on Me"" to the wicked blues cover ""Baby, Please Don't Go"". The title track is a scorcher and would become a concert favorite for many years while ""Show Business"" is a great blues rocker performed with zeal. Yeah, it's short and when they re-released this a few years back, you'd think they would have put more tunes from the vault on here but as they say: quality over quantity. It's certainly better than most of the stuff they've put out in the last two decades or so."
4,"Good, but it could have been SOOO much better","This is a thoroughly enjoyable EP from AC/DC, featuring five tracks from the Bon Scott era. All five songs are strong, and there's not really any filler here. The main complaint I have against this album is that there is truly a wealth of rare Bon era tracks that could have been included, to make this a full length, ""Carry Me Home"" being the first that comes to mind. But don't let that prevent you from picking this one up. I was initially hesitant to buy, as it costs nearly the same as a full length, but I play it regularly, and with great enjoyment! I just wish it were longer..."
4,not bad,"This EP is pretty hard to find. but i borrowed it from a friend and took a listen. it was pretty good. not bad. but not excellent. its great but don't get me wrong here. this is no If you want blood, or back in black. this is just a short EP with some good songs. Get this if you're a hard core ACDC fan. otherwise don't even think about it."
3,That's Show Business,"This album was released in 1984 to recognize AC/DC's big 10 years. The songs on this album were released only in Australia before being released in America. Bon Scott was long gone by the time this was released in America. I personally think this is a must- have for big AC/DC fans because this tracks were on Austrailian versions of Dirty Deeds and High Voltage. I think they could have put more songs like Rock In Peace (R.I.P.), School Days, Crabsody in Blue, Love Song, Stick Around, and Rockin in The Parlour. I want to hear some of these songs so bad, and huge fans would do anything to hear those songs. I will give this 3 stars for the five tracks, not bad, but more tracks please..."
3,Incomplete- Does not complete your Bon Scott- AC/DC collection,"I agree with some of the other reviews, 74 Jailbreak contains some great songs that you have to have but this CD does not contain all of the missing pieces of the Bon Scott/AC/DC puzzle. If you're a real fan you MUST hear: Carry Me Home, Fling Thing, Crabsody in Blue, Cold Hearted Man, Welfare Boogie, Stick Around, Rock In Peace, and LoveSong(you only need to hear LoveSong once). These songs reveal a slightly different side of Bon and the band that will allow you to appreciate them more. If all the pieces are what you seek then you must find ""Bonzo"". Good Luck!! RIP Bon."
3,"GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,NOT MUCH BANG FOR YOUR $","This is a good album actually any thing of the bon scott era is good,JAILBRAKE a great song the best song on the album but that was about it besides a great cover of BABY PLEASE DONT GO,they should have added SCHOOL DAYS,CRABSODY BLUES,COLD HEARTED MAN,and even a version of JONNY B.GOODE. but what can u do At the end its not enough bang for your buck,$11 to much for five songs."
1,Five songs for the price of a whole album... amazing!,"To sell only five songs for almost the same price of whole album is the typical example of greedy decisions made by a record company. It's absurd, even being AC/DC, my favourite band.THere are five songs here: four from their first album, released only in Australia back in 1974, called ""HIGH VOLTAGE"", and one from the Australian version of ""DIrty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"", the master piece track called ""Jailbreak"". Why on Earth, (back in 1981, when Atlantic finally released ""Dirty Deeds"" in the US) they chose to take ""Jailbreak"" out from the album and replace it is beyond my compreension....Well, you got my point... this album, altough the five songs are very good, makes no sense at all. IT was born as a greedy decision by Atlantic, nothing more than that."
5,A great gift,"My boyfriend is a huge ACDC fan but this was the one CD he would not buy himself. I got it for him and he was trilled, he listens to it all the time."
1,The worst music AC/DC ever released,I love AC/DC and would easily consider them one of the top 10 maybe top 5 bands of all time but this ep isn't worth the $10. In fact out of the 5 songs I think You Ain't Got A Hold On Me is the only good one. They all sound alike to me and I don't dig the blues side of AC/DC.
4,AC/DC - ' '74 Jailbreak' (Sony),"Until I recently dug this five-track mini-album up, I can't remember the last time I heard this vintage title. Think I once had a vinyl copy of this record. No matter, this is AC/DC at their very earliest work. Raw, angry and just plain heavy. However, at the same time, I think '74 Jailbreak' may be more bluesy than any of their other lp's. Play this one repeatedly, you'll have time.Classic track listing: ""Jailbreak""(4:40), ""You Ain't Got A Hold On Me""(3:30), ""Show Business""(4:43), ""Soul Stripper""(6:23) and their Big Joe Williams standard cover ""Baby,Please Don't Go""(4:50). Simply, a must-have."
3,Ok but the sticky glue isn't good,"The product itself is durable, however if you are going to place it in your garage and the temperature in your garage gets above 90 degrees, the gule adhesive it uses will not stay too long."
3,tight cool funk,"finally getting the Dolemite Music Soundtrack is banging. you can do the ""Chicken Noodle Soup"" Dance to the Music on this Soundtrack. ""Willie Green"" that is always associated when you thnk of Rudy Ray Moore. the Grooves are still tight as is the Production.alot of cool extras.hard to believe it's taken all this time for this Music to get to Soundtrack."
5,Best Little Baking Cups!,"I fell in love with the full-sized, pastel Sili-Cups (by Regency), before setting out to find the mini cups.I've had my full-sized cups for about 4 years, and have used them several times with great success.The price may seem high, but if you enjoy baking, or find yourself making cupcakes even just a few times per year, you'll definitely enjoy using these baking cups.I love mine!"
2,Poor,Loaded with bum notes! A poorly choreographed piece that accompanies one of the greatest Overtures the theater has ever known??? Why on earth would they want to stage that??And then the orchestra is often dire.. That famous overture is leaden and I heard trumpet split-notes! This is an abomination! Performers are only adequate and the staging is skimpy to threadbare. Stick with Hal Prince's 1986 New York City Opera version or even the recent concert. This is so cheap and lousy that if Bernstein were still alive- this would kill him.
2,stalled,once you pause the movie it never recovered. it continued to stall and then fast forward. if i tried to rewind it stalled even more.
5,Simulator checkride,"A must for a very specific reader: any airline pilot who is current or on prospective to get Boeing 757/67 family airplanes type rating. Mike Ray style is well humored and the topics are aborded in a very clear and professional manner. It is a very useful tool on recurrent training, saving a lot of exhaustive hours on airplane manuals, sometimes obscure and cluttered."
1,not as kool,I just got this CD today was very excited to listen to it to my dissapointment is not as good as their later stuff so i cant recommend it dosent sound like reggaeton at all.
3,A lot of Stone to Color.,"Most of the pictures are of stone structures, not a very diverse color scheme. Pictures are almost too detailed to color with anything other than a fine point colored pencil. Kids weren't too excited about them."
5,Great learning tool,I like my grandchildren to be creative and to learn from their activities. My 12 year old grandchild favors this book and learns a bit of history in the process.
5,Outstanding Digital Camera,The Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart 618 Digital Camera is the top of the line when it comes to price and quality.The price of this camera is about half the price you would pay for a camera of equal value.Picture quality is excellent.The menu is very easy to use.The features of the 618 are exceptional as comparied to other cameras in the same price range.
5,Great Camera,"The 618 offers many features for a reasonable price. Menus are easy to understand. USB uploads are quick and the Scanner/Camera Wizard in Windows ME makes it super easy. Although others have reported problems with USB and Dell laptops, my Inspiron 5000e works perfectly.I've been using the 618 for 3 months now and taken about 700 pictures. I would say at least 95% of the pictures are excellent. My biggest complaint is when you turn the camera on, the lens zooms all the way out and sometimes I don't want to wait for that.Compared to the Sony digital cameras I have used at work, the 618 blows them away. I do not understand why Sony insists on using a floppy disk to store pictures. Also, the viewfinder on the 618 works great, so I can turn off the LCD screen to extend battery life. (The Sony models did not even have a viewfinder, you had to use the LCD screen)"
3,Stick with a 35mm,"HP C618 has one of the best price/parformance values on the market, yet it only proves the inferiority of digital cameras.Pros:* Great image resolution for a very low price* Very good ergonomics, including the memory card storage* Up to 30 medium-resolution pictures on the accompanying memory cardCons:* Flash-happy. Basically all you have to do is to stand in a shadow and the camera will trigger the flash. You'll have to disable it manually very often.* Color shift. The camera tends to use an excess of green color, which you'll have to offsett with adding yellow and red on most pictures.* Automatic options are shifted towards a low-end point and click cameras, so you'll have to use the display to adjust the picture options exstensivelly. this has a negative impact on the battery life."
2,It broke 45 days after buying it.,The lens won't retract all the way nor will it focus properly. It also requires new batteries about every 40 pictures
1,not worth the effort,"The camera took great pictures, but downloading from it to the computer would not work. I had to buy a card reader. Battery life was very short. The camera circuit board blew in less than 18 months and would cost $250 to fix, making it worthless. I'll never buy another HP camera."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this camera more than a year ago. I'd rate it 5 stars except that I had the following problem: The door of my battery compartment got broken! The problem looks silly enough, but upon calling HP they ""simply"" told me that my product is 'out-of-warranty' and they don't service it anymore. Even worse, they offered a trade up with a newer model. After checking the prices for the newer models, it turned out that they're buying back my camera for less! All the service centers that I could find on their websites told me that they don't service digital cameras (not only mine). So here I am with a great camera that's totally useless because of a broken plastic part and a lousy customer service."
1,DON'T BUY IT. RIP OFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"""DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER. THEY MISREPRESENT THEMSELVES. THEY SAY ONE THING ON THE BIDDER'S PAGE, BUT WHEN YOU PULL UP THE ACTUAL ITEM, THEY TELL YOU IT COMES WITH A MEMORY CARD. WHO SELLS A CAMERA WITHOUT AN OWNERS MANUAL? IT'S JUST A RIPOFF. I WONDER WHERE THESE CAMERAS REALLY COME FROM WITHOUT BOXES, OWNERS MANUALS, CABLES, MEMORY CARDS. THIS CAMERA DOESN'T OPERATE WITHOUT MEMORY CARD AT ALL."" YOU HAVE NO MEMORY CARD, NO BATTERIES, NO OWNERS MANUAL, NO CORD TO CONNECT TO DOWNLOAD PICTURES. YOU'D BE BETTER OFF PAYING FOR A NEW UPDATED VERSION OF THIS CAMERA FROM A REPUTABLE DEALER. YOU'LL END UP SPENDING THE SAME AMOUNT ONCE YOU BUY ALL THE ACCESSORIES NEEDED TO WORK THE CAMERA, BUT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET A FULL REFUND FROM A REPUTABLE COMPANY IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG"
3,It will take you places.,"This book like walking, meanders in and out of many ideas and worlds. Sometimes this is disconcerting, but it also inspiring. And really tells how you can achieve self sufficency by goatwalking.I hope one day to re read this while sitting in a canyon far from civilization with my goats in the distance."
4,Great grow journal,I liked how he trhoughly goes through a regular constant process to show you the aspects of each plant you can grwo it however you want but these are a constant experiment formula used throughly through each plant. It really gives you an idea of what each could hold in other ways of growing.
3,Snore fest.,"I was hoping for a great new coffee table book, but ""Cannabible"" this is NOT. Apparently Albie has a limited vocabulary. His reports are seriously boring and hard to read or follow. He supposedly spent some time in ""The Dam"" and thinks he's still in Europe with his metric measuring of plant heights etc. He supposedly, too, lives in San Francisco. Then why the metric measurements? There may be some or most of the blame placed at the feet of the editor. If you can possibly view this book prior to purchase, do it. Then decide if you want to waste your money. Then go buy the Cannabibles or Big Book of Buds series instead.I have to give some credit for the photography...excellent! But I swear the close-ups and bud shots don't match the actual variety, and I think they used the same bud for close-ups multiple times. Even though the pictures are pretty, the text stinks.At any rate....BORING."
5,"""Cha-Cha-Cha-Tito Puente & His Orch.-Live At Grossinger's""","In this ""collector's item"" CD, are the Dec.1959, RCA live recordings by ""King Tito & His Orchestra's at the famous Catskill Mts.resort ""Grossinger's Hotel"", in Liberty, N.Y. Tropical Series producer Domingo Echevarria and his engineer Dick Baxter did an excellent job in this 1996 re-issue. Screen & theatre classics like ""Kismet's Baubles, Bangles & Beads"" and also, Cha-Cha-Cha and even mambo versions of ""How High The Moon"", ""Grossinger's Cha Cha"", ""Puente At Grossinger's, ""Managua, Nicaragua"", ""Miami Beach Cha-Cha"" and the album's ending ""Philadelphia Mambo"", have greater rhythm and pep when played and recorded live. If you are a Puente fan, you do not want to miss this CD. Its a must for all afro-cuban music collectors!"
3,It or me???,I used this iron for the first time today and water poured out of the sole plate onto my silk shirt. What did Ido wrong? Hopefully the next time I decide to iron - I quit this time - I'll have better results. I iron veryinfrequently so......
2,Crass commercial cash-in!,"It becomes evident early on that the work is geared toward film adaptation. Much of the material comes across as unnecessary and expendable. The plots are feeble and the ending is unnatural, and throughout, we encounter tense situations that are artificial, at best. Critical acclaim and commercial success have rendered the author lethargic in his prose. Apparently he is interested more in cashing a big paycheck than producing memorable literature. Nevertheless, the material will likely gain acceptance from the credulous movie-going public, much like last summer's film version of `New Mexico' and the straight-to-video `California Rules of Civil Procedure III: Beach Barristers.'"
2,where's the beef?,"This book lacks substance. The author sounds as though she wants the characters to do something, without knowing what that ""something"" is. It's very lawyerly, in a way."
2,Not just a river in Egypt.,"This effort seems a fundamental betrayal of the author's seminal work, ""Code Dependent No More""."
2,Too much like a car seat?,"I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant). My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser. For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway. My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel ""too snug"" in it. They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep. If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it."
4,Seems secure - a few small gripes,"This seems to be a secure seat, and our almost-5-year old is comfortable in it. The buckling system is a bit inconvenient - you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped. I wish our son could buckle himself in at this point, but this seat makes it too hard. It's also not a seat you want to do air travel with, as it's unwieldy to carry around. But, all in all I would say it's a good purchase."
1,Too much for too little,"I've used this car seat for over a year. My daughter didn't care for it too much. I'm not sure what she hated more the head rest or the seat which is about as soft as a towel covering a rock. The cup holders can in no way function as a cup holder. The car seat head unit is made up of a flexible plastic, Styrofoam, covered with cloth. Somehow during the moving the car seat around we cracked the Styrofoam in two places. Thus foam was falling out of the head rest. Well a call to Britax and waiting on hold for about 30 mins I was told it would cost $10 for a replacement piece. A car booster seat needs to last longer however I was able to damage mine in about a year. The replacement foam (the same stuff cheap beer coolers are made of) costing $10 seems a bit excessive."
5,Great car seat,I love this booster seat. It keeps my son's head upright when he falls a sleep. The crash resistant foam makes me feel he is safer. The only complaint is that the cup holders are not deep enough to hold the cup in place.
3,"The writing was very tabloid-ish, especially the titles of the stories; I don't much care for that style","The titles of the chapters were really trashy, but the stories themselves were written in a surprisingly low-key manner, and the murders they described were quite ordinary. Meh. I think I'll stick to Ann Rule."
3,Wonderful Book,I love true crime stories. This book has one perticular story that I am related to and that is why I bought the book in the first place. Now because of this book I am hooked on true crime books. From Rose G. Mandelsberg to Ann Rule. This was the first time that I have actually known someone that the story is about It was kind of short and I hope that Rose does a follow up on where the murderers are now type of story. I only know about my story and nothing about the rest in the book. The story on the front is about my aunt who hired those two hit men to kill my uncle. All I know is that my Aunt is still in prison and I don't know about the hit men. That is why it would be nice if Rose did a follow up story. Well hope you enjoy the book.
5,A Must Have,"This is wonderful music made by extraordinary musicians. If you are interested enough to reading these reviews, you need this music in your life."
5,Staring In Disbelief At Your Stereo,"As a high school jazz musician, I've met kids with the most refined sense of music possible. So when a of friend of mine, one of the best young jazz trombonists in the state of CA, told me in utter disbelief he had heard the greatest jazz recording in his life, I didn't question. These two CDs cannot be explained. When I first listened to Extended Play, I literally was staring at my speakers, jaw limp, totally numb. Over 2 hours of music, and they've crammed every second full of musical mastery and excitement. Each song is an endless stream of creativity and expression. The solos are mindnumbing (my personal recomemdation is the Eubanks/Potter a-cappella duet in Prime Directive), the music is rich and interesting, and it is non-stop for 2 hours. For anyone who likes jazz, it should be illegal not to own these CDs. Gordon Goodwin this ain't."
2,Not as pictured and NOT for children 18mo-3years,"The positive.-This ball seems very durable.-It seems that a larger child 5-10 could effectivly play on it and enjoy it.The negative.-It did not arrive in red (as the color on the picture indicated). It came in purple. This wouldn't be an issue, but I choose this ball specifically because it was red.-It has 'horns' (one for each hand) instead of one singular loop handle (as the picture suggests). These are a little more difficult to jump with (especially for a 2 year old), but could be an extra safety feature for when a child falls (by freeing up the hands faster to support the body).-My child is 2yrs 9mo and he does NOT fit on this ball (eventhough manufactured recommended age is 18mo-3years).Suggestion... If you're getting this ball for a toddler, be sure to get one with a smaller diameter.I would have given it 1 star for it's advertised use... but it seems like it'll be fun and durable later on."
2,Cannot be filled.,"This ball arrived with the plug already in place and it cannot be removed to fill it. There are absolutely no directions, it is absurd. We purchased a smaller one also from a different company and it filled up quickly and works great. It is christmas morning and I can't fill the ball. I am VERY upset."
5,Hoppity Hop,My 9 year old son LOVES this. It's plenty big enough for him too...Most are not. Great investment for him. Extremely durable as well.
5,My child loves it!,My 7yo daughter loves it. She hops all around the house on it. Great exercise and a lot of fun.
5,Great Shampoo,"Clean Volume is exactly what you get. The fullness was amazing, especially if you shampoo twice and rinse well. The only down side for me was trying to find the product in local markets and drugstores. I finally had to resort to the internet, so I ordered three bottles. The effort is worth it."
1,Bristles Glued On,"The ""Harold Import Coffee Grinder Brush"" is imported from you-know-where. After a few washes, a tuft of the bristles came off. The bristles have apparently been glued on, so this Coffee Grinder Brush will not stand up to repeated washings.I would recommend thisEspresso Supply Grinder Brushinstead. The bristles on this are tightly secured onto the handle with a metal band (or ferrule) -- the same way the bristles on paint brushes are attached.As of this writing, theEspresso Supply Grinder Brushcosts about the same as this brush, and there's free shipping ;)."
1,Avoid,"This brush can't even perform the simple task for which it's designed. How can it screw up something so straightforward?1) It sheds bristles like a nervous Labrador. Now I need another brush to clean out the bristles left behind by this brush.2) The bristles are too soft, so they just kind of languorously spread the grounds around.3) It's even harder to clean this brush than to clean with this brush.If anything good came out of me buying this brush, it is to save you from making the same mistake."
3,This brush is great,"for its intended purpose but be ever vigilant about loose bristles. Do not get me wrong, I really do like this brush."
2,more style than function,"these seem like a good idea but my little one wants to chew on them, which means they don't keep her clean. the baby bjorn firm one works better for really clothing protection."
4,Mystery and Romance in post war Berlin,M. M. Kaye does a wonderful job of capturing the expat/military community in the post war era. She really nails the different personalities and cobbles together a neat little mystery.
4,Sassy loves these!,"I bought these for my little chihuahua/Jack Russel mix? and she loves them. They're just her size. I do watch her when I give her one as she does have a tendency to gulp everything she chews on (and that includes everything.) but so far so good and she hasn't had any stomach problems. So I recommend these, but with a little caution."
2,Should rate more from what I've read,"I read a rave review of Cobra High in a local rag and picked up this CD based on that recommendation. Unfortunately, as the previous reviewer commented, the recording of this band, however talented they may be, is very poor. I gave this CD 2 stars mostly because they are trying to succeed in a genre (prog rock) that doesn't get much attention these days.From the review they appear to be a good band to catch live. That sounds about right for a prog-rock ensemble.All that said, I hope these guys stay together and record another CD with better production values ."
1,Never Worked,"I ordered this for my nursery to play a CD once in a while. I plugged it in, forgot about it and when I went to use it a week later, could not get the CD to play. I tried everything. The radio worked fine but no CD player. Wish I could send this terrible item back."
1,NICE SIZE CHEAP QUALITY,"I BOUGHT THIS TO PLAY MY CDS WHEN OUTSIDE WORKING ON CAR OR IN YARD.THE RADIO AM/FM WORKS FINE,BUT THE CD PLAYER NEVER WORK AT ALL WHEN I RECEIVED IT NEW FROM AMAZON.I DID NOT SEND THIS UNIT BACK DUE TO I GOT FREE SHIPPING AND THE COST WAS SO CHEAP, SO I KEPTED IT AND USE IT FOR THE RADIO ONLY."
1,GPX boombox,"This item was a total waste. It didn't even make it 30 days before it died. I threw all of the paperwork away, thinking it would last for a longer period of time, so I was stuck with it. Granted, it was a bargain, but it also ended up being a waste of my money."
1,There are better CD players to buy...,"My wife bought this in a pinch and it sufficed for that pinch. However, it does not work as anything but a piece of junk you expect to get pounded to death over a short period of time. It would be far more cost effective to spend an extra $10 and get something much better. Our problems with this player are 1) it won't read many of our cds, especially CD-Rs; 2) it skips constantly and for no reason even after cleaning the laser; 3) it is not very user friendly (e.g. will only read a new cd if you shut the thing off, insert cd, then start it again).Overall, I'm not sure it was worth purchasing for the pinch my wife wanted it for."
2,You get what you pay for,"Although this works well enough, the sound level over a certain point becomes horrible. It's cheap, and that's what's good about it. I don't feel too bad if I beat it up a bit."
5,This is exactly what I wanted!,I needed a cd player for my 4 year old granddaughter's room. I wanted simple and inexpensive. I was thrilled with my purchase and even my granddaughter can operate it. What a find.
2,Skippy... not the peanut butter kind.,"Decent CD player for the price. We bought it for our baby, so we weren't going Bose. Anyway, it's ok, but it skips like crazy. If a feather lands on it, the CD skips... seriously. Also, the repeat and other similar functions are a little complex and confusing. And, no, it's not us! :)"
5,"The most practical, quilting handbook I have read.","This book is one of the best quilting handbooks that I have read. Tips for Quilters gives hints from many experienced quilters rather than just one author, like most other quilting guides. I felt like I had an entire quilting group right there with me to give helpful suggestions for my quilting questions. Whether your an experienced quilter or a beginner, this book will help you better your quilting techniques."
4,liked it,"good for working out rhythms while song writing, havent had a chance to work out all the nuances for gigging"
4,Drum Machine,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it! It is easy to use and lets him be creative. It was just as explained, can't wait to hear it on big speakers. Thanks"
1,A timebomb,"I bought one of these several years ago. The last time I tried to hook it up, and powered up, and everything looked normal. However, upon connecting the cables to an amp, no sound was produced.I was talking to my friend last night about wanting to buy a drum machine, and without mentioning my experience or Alesis by name, he brought up an Alesis SR-16 that he had - but it doesn't output sound.These things WILL stop working. Google it."
1,Crap,"I just got the SR-16. I unpacked it and turned it on. It worked for a couple of hours and then it simply stopped working. Now, I have to box it up and send it back. This is very uncool. The QA on this product did not work!Crap!!!!!!!!"
5,Been using mine for almost 30 years,I have had one of these since 1984 and have been using it almost every day. It is an amazing product.
2,Comes loose,"After seeing that this was the brand that William-Sonoma sells, we ordered one as we are avid pepper users. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the unit, as the top screw keeps loosening and as a result, we can't get a fine grind.So, I will continue my quest for the perfect pepper grinder..."
4,More dancing from Babylon,"Ok, I must admit I was looking forward to the release of this CD. I have really loved the last 2 in the series. This one is pretty good but does have some questionable songs, the one by Yoko Ono comes to mind immediately.This is a departure from the first 2 season soundtracks as they have added another cd with some additional music, not more songs from Babylon but from other scenes in the show. Some interesting tracks on that cd as well. Kind of strange to see a Pete Townsend song on a QAF soundtrack. The second cd also is enhanced and you can watch the ""Get Some"" video, which has been played on Showtime. It features the cast of the show and is pretty cute.If you're a fan of the show, this is a must have. If you need some good dance tunes, this is also the cd for you. Sadly, I feel the cd is far better then the series from which it comes."
1,Undesirable CD,"Their past compilations are a hell of a lot better! The backing music bites except for 3 or 4 tracks, the rest is trash! This isn't what real dance music is like! Skip this commercialized suff!"
2,Disappointing -- buy the second season CD,"Less than 50 minutes of club music on the first CD, and not sure what they're trying to do with the second CD. There's so much good music on the series -- WHERE IS IT? Why isn't it on these CD's? If you're going to buy one soundtrack, get the SECOND season -- much much much superior."
4,buy it!,wellif u like the music in the 3 season u gonna love this album.u have 1 cd with the slow song. like the song that play when justin find out that eytan cheated on him. and u have 1 cd that play babylon song.buy it!
4,Head down to the dance floor,"This is a great cd, it contains some of the hottest club anthems around, but the problem is that it only has eight songs on the first cd. The second cd, in my opinion, is disposable. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this cd is better than the second season. Although, it does have better songs, like Ono's ""Walking On Thin Ice"" and the Tiesto mix of ""Never Past Tense."" Overall, I would have given it a five star rating if it weren't for the useless second cd and because the first cd is too short."
3,Expectations and plans,"This is an energetic and interesting book. I was disappointed, however, at the very tiny and unscaled drawings in the plans. If you want to build any of the boats described in this book, be prepared to buy the plans from the author at $20 per set."
5,Very good book for plywood boat building,"I found this book to be very helpful. It makes boat building accesible to almost anyone. But I wish there were more photos, especially of finished boats. I decided to build the Nymph, the 7' 9"" pram design featured in this book. Then I decided I wanted a beamier (wider) boat so I built the wider version of the Nymph, called the Rubens Nymph (Please note: The Rubens Nymph is not featured in this book, only the Nymph is). I did not buy plans, but just widened the bottom and transoms of the Nymph, and used thicker plywood for the frames. So boats can be built from this book without plans, but if I did it again I would get the plans...especially for any of the larger boats."
4,Instant boats made easy,An excellent follow on from the first book with step by step instructions for building.An easy book to read and follow as you build a boat from the plans included. Gypsy is my favourite
3,"A Good Basic Guide, but short on important details","I purchased this book after browsing free boat plans online.While ""Build the New Instant Boats"" covers the basics like what tools to use (kind of ""boatbuilding ABC""), it's sorely lacking in actual plan details.If you think you can buy this book and avoid buying the full-sized plans, think again (like I did) -- you'd be better off heading over to Hannu's Boatyard, where Hannu has much more detailed plans.This book probably used to be a creditable effort because when it first came out, stitch-and-glue construction wasn't that popular. But today everyone and their brother is selling (and giving away..) stitch-and-glue boat plans on the Internet, and many of these plans (see Hannu's Boatyard and Dinghy.PL) are very high quality."
1,Be wary,"This is _not_ a construction book. You _will_ have to buy full sized plans. This is a book about ""Building the new instant boats"", its not a book about ""Let me show you how to build the new instant boats"". I think this may be a case where the best doer doesn't make the best teacher."
5,Anyone Can Build a Boat,"The eleven boats described here can't really be called weekend projects for a beginner, and some of the building techniques are a little complex, but a careful reader should be able to build a working small boat within several weeks of weekends using only the plans in the book. A few pieces of plywood, glue, glass and resin and a ripped down 2x4 for trim is all that is required to be out on the water, well, next year. Plans cover the whole spectrum of small craft from a boxy dingy to an outboard skiff and even a tiny schooner. Most of these boats are strictly functional, although the first design, Gypsy, is a nice trim rowing or sailing dory. Payson does a good job of sharing his own love of small boats by describing some interesting points about woodworking and sailing."
1,"DON""T BUY KINDLE EDITION",If you buy the Kindle edition you can not read the plans. Even if you use a manifying program the numbers are completely illegible which makes the book completely useless.
5,For the Waterman at Heart,"Just as expected - the book simple and informative. If you want to build ""any"" boat, begin here. You'll be encouraged."
2,A little (lot) on the flimsy side,"Well, you get what you pay for (and even then, 50 bucks is a bit much for a baby doll stroller..). The only thing really useful in this set is the stroller. The high chair is *ok* but it's not durable in any sense which is the running theme for this set. It just isn't put together well and is easily broken/pulled apart.The playpen is just.. poles and cloth, it doesn't even look right when you get it up together. The high chair tray lost one of it's tabs while trying to put it together so I can't use it. The instructions for it are abysmal.Go ahead and get one stroller and one baby bed and call it a day. You can even get a two-in-one stroller/baby bed cheaper. It's a buggy and the bed part pulls out. You are not getting anything extra by buying this set."
2,VERY Cheaply made.,"I ordered this set for my 6 year old who loves baby accessories. She was most excited to get the playpen. Well it came and I went to assembling and started with the stroller. While attaching the wheels the cap that covers the pole broke. Which of course makes the pole come out, therefore having no way to keep the front wheels on. Ok I can deal with one problem with the set. So then I go onto the highchair. Well the back was so warped that it wouldn't snap together like it should. So it doesnt sit flat. Why don't I send this back, I am sure you are asking yourself? Well because my 6 year old doesn't want to have to wait for another week to play with the playpen and carrier that she loves. But I can guarantee I will not buy this brand again."
2,DOLLPLAY SET WITH PLAYPEN,"PRODUCT HAD NUMEROUS PIECES MISSING SO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HAD TO BE HAND RIGGED, ALL THE PIECES ARE UNSTABLE, FALL APART EASILY. HOWEVER, VISUALLY THE SET IS ADORABLE, AND MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER HAD A GREAT TIME WITH HER DOLLY AND THE PLAYSET.. WILL PURCHASE A NAME BRAND NEXT TIME AND WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS MANUFACURER EVER AGAIN. WISH I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE AND PURCDHASED SOMETHING THAT WOULD LAST."
1,not the best,one of the door click fell of the second day of using it. it dont hold 10 cigar 6x60 only 4
4,For use with E-cig protection,"I bought this case to protect my Provari Electronic cigarette (not actual cigars.) As a case, it is very solid and does the job of protecting it's contents very well. I have dropped this case several times, each resulting in zero damage to my E-cig. Once, I even dropped it into a puddle with no damage to the electronics, and no apparent water leakage (though based on it's soft gasket I would not call this a 100% water proof case.) One drop did result in chipping one of the clips, but still 100% functional. I would give 5 stars for a rubber gasket, and if the clips themselves were of better quality; they pop right off almost every time trying to open the case. But this was no problem to some one with a few drops of hobby glue."
1,Clips Fly Off,The opening clips are just set in the caddy by pressure. Every time I open it the clips fly off!Also the humidifier is a joke.I wouldn't buy this again.
5,Buy it!!,"One of the best gifts I ever received!! Got it for Xmas last year and have travelled with it over a dozen times with no issues. It's heavy-duty and fits in any of my travel bags. Make sure to keep it out of direct sunlight when it's full as anything black can attract the heat pretty well (it's a scary deal in a Texas summer.) Also, be careful not to overfill the humidifier. Use cap-fuls. Some of the cigars I smoke are too large of a guage to fit 10 of them in the box but I never bring 10 of the same cigar so there's usually a skinnier stick to even it out. LOVE this thing and I highly recommend buying one."
3,Not Bad,"Bang for the buck, not bad. holds a good seal but the foam layers don't allow for a full 40 cigars. The adhesive for the hydrate doesn't stay but a little crazy glue can fix that. All in all, it's not a bad product. The case is durable and adequate for my immediate need for a humidor that I don't mind beating up."
5,Great carry case,"The foam inserts are a softer, more pliable material than other cigar caddies I've had. The grooves between ridges are narrow so large ring guage cigars have to be wriggled into the gap, gently. Still good tough travel case. Very satisfied with it over all."
4,Great Travel Humidor,"Great humidor! Strong, well padded and insulated, and keeps the stogies fresh and ready. Good strong clasps won't open in flight.This is what all travel humidors should be."
2,Disappointing,"After seeing the ratings, I thought this would be a great Bocelli concert - I own the others - but it did not live up to the rating - the NY philharmonic was great, as were the guest instumentalists, but the guest singers did not measure up, nor did the material chosen. Celine's performance was lackluster (especially in comparison to Heather Headley on the same song in the Tuscan concert). And home on the range in NYC? - give me a break! Buy the others, give this a pass"
5,BEAUTIFUL SINGING,"Beautiful concert. First half is opera, some solo, some duets with guest soprano or baritone. A gem. Buy it now."
5,A super DVD,"The PBS / Great Performances crowd did a super job of capturing this live performance on video -- and what a performance it is! Andrea Bocelli sings his heart out, and there isn't a bad song to be found anywhere. On the contrary, many of the performances are thrilling: ""Amazing Grace"" and a few others brought tears to my eyes. The audience reaction shots show that they were just as thrilled.If you love music, you want this DVD!"
4,Love the talent of Bocelli,"Amazingly well done in an outdoor setting. Felt like I was there and could see even better. Loved Amazing Grace, when he said ""I was blind, but now I see."""
4,"Andrea good as always, but","This is good, just not great. Andrea good as always, but I would have preferred more classical and less 'pop'. The Orchestra was great, as were the guests, and the photography as well. I just prefer to have either a classical or a 'pop' program. I have two other other Bocelli programs that are single-themed, and love them. One of the tings that I wish they would do on these videos is put a notation with the title of the piece of music. Some pieces are easily recognizable, some are not."
3,Ok but shakier than OEM,"I used this on my 96 Explorer. Fits ok and works, but the mirrror shakes more that the original OEM part. It is still safe and functional, but just a little annoying. It is not enough for me to request a refund/replacement and redo all work of installing it, but if I could do it all over again with no added labor from me, I would go with the OEM part."
3,It's ok,"Elephant is very cute, not as soft or big as I thought it would be. I'm still trying to deide if I am going to keep it for my one year old. I definitely think its way over priced!"
5,LOVE THIS HUGE ELEPHANT,PURCHASED 2 OF THESE ELEPHANTS FOR CHRISTMAS FOR TWIN GRANDSONS GREAT GIFT BEST STUFFED TOY I HAVE EVER PURCHASED SUPER FAST SHIPPING CANT WAIT TO SEE THERE SWEET FACES WHEN THEY OPEN THIS HUGE ELEPHANTS THANK YOU 100 STARS
3,INTRODUCTION To BAHAI FAITH,"I was given this book by Ypsi-Ann Arbor Bahai member, Ms.Diane Teherzhede (wife of Mr. Riaz Teherzhede) as her suggestion introduction to expanded religion. It was one of her personal collection from her home and therefore well read by her own repeated reference to the words inside. As a result of the necessity for her to ""reintroduce"" herself to her religion, I did ot finish more than the first portion of the first chapter. Of that part read, Mr. Sears aptly describes the need for religion in the lives of those who live independently in this earth. It is an individual issue, however, that persons choose what is more improtant to them in selecting a religion. If honesty, trust and peac of mind are emminent among those items of importance I suggest looking further than what is suggested in this book. Most people prefer better substance to belief than that offered by the carded guidelines of the BAHAI FAITH."
5,God never stop talking people quit looking and listening,I had search for a long time for an answer to many questions. I knew in my heart that before Christs coming God had passes his word through many manefestations. I knew in my heart that there had to be more. I during my search I came across the Bahai Faith. The answers to my questions were beging to unfold. But I needed proof I needed truth. In this book and my trusty bible I have finally found it. If your searching this is a great place to start.
2,Disappointed in content,"There are a few things that I find troubling with this book. The least of these is the very unlikely claim that Sears was a Christian when he undertook his research/writing this book. What I really found troubling was the gross misunderstanding of or loose interpretation of the Bible. He took little snippets here and there and used them to prove his points rather than taking the passage in context to understand what is said. His faulty use of research and prophecy shot the books credibility before it had even gotten to what Bahaullah had to say. As the book stands, the only value it has is in understanding the Baha'i faith.I recommend the review by a Baha'i that describes well the problems I had with the book: [...]I would also recommend people read the Bible in a modern translation as well as ""The Case for the Real Jesus"" or ""More Than a Carpenter"" for a better look at who Jesus really is and what the Bible has to say about him."
5,A great B-Class movie,"I didn't actually know the history behind this shootout before watching it, but it really gives you an appreciation for our men&women; in blue.Most B-Class movies in my opinion are not worth watching, but the sypnosis for this film caught my attention. The action is great, the story captures your attention, and the coreography, special effects, characters, and everything else was really well done.I just wish that the movie lasted longer."
4,44 Minutes,Very good movie about the true story of the worst shootout in the history of Los Angeles. Very good cast and a lot of action.
1,E-Z Legal Forms is not worth the money,"This software package is one of the worst that I have seen in a long time. I was hoping to do a simple promissary note and the forms they provide were not adequate for this. Their form has one paragraph that says penalties will be due if the payment is days late. It will not let you put in the number of days, pretty poor. I would definitely not reccomend this product."
2,Stay away,Used Quicken for over 10 years. Always hope the next version will correct the bugs; never happens. If you track a lot of investments the database will get corrupt. Support is fee based even for bugs. Interface is cumbersome.
3,okay,"The color wasn't what I expected, it was actually a dark purple. It doesn't glide on too easily either."
2,Sephora Brand Jumbo Pencil in Eye Purple 504Y,This color is great but it smears and fades away quickly so there is a need for touch ups often.
4,how to sharpen?,"I was looking for a FAT crayon eye-liner pencil and this is what I thought I wanted but it IS VERY fat! and so I don't know how I am going to sharpen it.It's hard to draw a ""line"" too so I just draw one ""in general."" I probably won't buy it again."
3,Decent,"This is a bit advanced for my son who is just over 2 yrs. If the pictures were simpler and some of the ideas presented in a different way, it would be good for younger kids like my son, too. I pick a few cards that represent ideas he already has a fundamental grasp of and we just do a few at a time- 2 or 3. He bores of it very quickly. Possibly age-related-- he doesn't sit still very long. My thought is it is better for an older child (because of the pics). However, it's a good product. I would have ordered it anyway, but I probably would have waited until he was closer to three."
5,Excellent,"Soledad has managed to bring folk music back to life. She's introduced todays youth to music, verbiage and cliche's our parents grew up with. Her music has stirred nostalgia for my home town of Montevideo. I'm very glad for her success and hope she is appreciated here as well."
1,lo peor del folklore,"el unico consuelo que puede quedar a los que gusten de la musica argentina y latinoamericana es que esta chica se dedique a destruir la musica de otros paises mas lejanos y cante en ingles, frances o ruso. O quizas algun dia se acabara el aparato que la sostiene y se dedicara a martirizar , en un futuro,a sus niños con horrorosas versiones de bellas canciones infantiles, tal como la hace aqui con cuanta melodia y letra le pusieron delante. BASTA SOLEDAD POR FAVOR !!!!!"
5,A Tom Hanks fan,"When seeing the movie Big growing up I thought it was one of the best movies watching it over and over. As Tom Hanks made greater movies such as Cast Away also starring Helen Hunt, I rushed to see it and loved it as well. This dvd to me is a collection of two great movies that are a must see"
5,I give Final Exam 10 fingers up!!!!!,"Not only was this book heartwarming, but suspense-filled. The cover was a little weird though because the school on the cover says Columbine High, and I read this book 1 week after the Columbine tragedy. The events in the story were similar to the real events at Columbine. I read this book in 1 day because I couldn't put it down."
1,Poor,I swore I bought the biggest one. This one they sent me is a lot smaller and works like crap....the seller just wanna make a fortune on this...do not buy!
3,It absorbs,works good. Leavews no streaks.Only downfall is that it starts to tear apart after sometime of using it.I do recommend this product. It works all the time
5,A little piece of art,"I've had 5 bluetooth headsets so far. Jabra was the first one I got, and now I'm back for Jabra. I had problem with it for a while; it kept dropping signals. I tried to update the firmware and now it's all good. I like the fact that customers can do their own maintenance.I'm very comfortable with the wearing, and I have no idea why some people complained--they might have special ear shape or size...I'm using it mostly as a stereo headset and the sound quality is quite acceptable. The only concern is its battery is not long as my other sets, it lasts about 5 hours when listen to music."
3,Close but no cigar,"This could be THE Headsets of headsets, it has everything.Vibra ring, call list, stereo and playback capability. You never have to take your phone out of your pocket. Which is great with my HTC Advantage 7501 (it's huge!) I got 60ft of distance in an open room with stereo.All this goes down the toilet with the fact it won't stay on your ear.What good is a headset that when you move falls off.Now whats worse is the ear holder falls out of it's hole after a good amount of on/off your ear..So I'm left with holding it up to my ear...If I had a small phone it would totally invalidate the use of it.It's like having a ferrari and the steering wheel keeps falling off..Soooo close Jabra....But no Cigar!!"
3,Pretty Good,"I hear just fine with this setup, but those I speak with say it sounds like I'm in a tunnel. I bought this strictly for cell phone, not music, so have no experience with stereo aspects.Pretty easy to use."
2,Ear piece falls off,"The Jabra BT8010 advertised well, but as for performance... The over-the-ear loop falls off easily making it hard to keep it secured to the ear. You have to take the earpiece off and look at the display in order to use its calling features (which defeats the purpose of hands-free in a car). The controls for the music functions are unclear and unreliable. The earpiece advertises as being able to work with 2 devices, but it does not allow you to select which device to interact with. I was disappointed with it."
3,So so,"Well, the sound quality is great, but sometimes loses the signal when walking. Got it primarily for jogging and the gym. This is not its best area of use. One of the ear arms broke after a couple of month of constant use. I plugged it back, but it comes out from time to time."
2,"Not great but decent, Jabra support nightmare","Good concept but poorly implemented.I had the stereo pair for two years now and the headset has been progressively failing in more than one way.First 3 months, good, echo on the other side. Months 4-6 issues with the control of the phone from the headset, it goes from 1-2 second delays to non-responsiveness.Months 7-12, sound is getting worse and sometimes I get a lot of interference; first earhook broke, requested Jabra to replace them...no good...they said they ran out, they simply do not care about any of the other sound issues. So I bought some earhooks.Months 13-24, noise is pretty bad most of the time with intermittent silent moments, horrible. I already went trough four earhooks and I am about to buy a Plantronics or Motorola. I contacted Jabra and after a few weeks they respond with a no good, good luck with your problems attitude.Jabra is out for me."
4,"Great sound, fairly comfortable",The sound is great. It is a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The ear loops also slip out of the ear pieces a little too easily which has caused me to almost loose the headset several times. Too bad it doesn't use the far more comfortable in-ear gel design of some of Jabra's other headsets.
4,Music doesn't work with IPHONE,"******iPHONE Owners*******ATTEN: if you are buying this device to use with iPhone, the music function of this bluetooth headset will not work with it, because the iPhone does not have the necessary Bluetooth stereo profile (A2DP) to allow the transfer of the music through Bluetooth.Beside the lack of music function on iPhone that doesn't work with this headset, another issue I am having is it doesn't snug fit as well just like other reviewer stated, maybe that's the design of it, but I don't really feel comfortable about it, hence only 4 stars. Otherwise Jabra bluetooth headset is something you can always trust."
1,Will not stay on your ear,"Jabra missed the basic mark on this headset. Save your money.One of the things a bluetooth headset requires most is the ability to stay on your ear. The BT8010, does not fill that requirement.The headset will not stay on. You'll find yourself losing the ear hooks frequently. Sometimes the ear hooks fall off all together or they will stay hooked to your ear. In either case you'll find that you can't enjoy music or making calls.What was Jabra's design team thinking.Jabar"
1,You must be kidding!,"I don't see how these would fit anyones ears! They don't fit snug, they flop around and are huge! Doesn't matter how well they connect or sound (ok but not great) if you can't wear them comfortably.The stereo sound is nice even when just talking on the phone but it's not worth the pain and agony of trying to strap these to your head.IF you don't have to have stereo then just get a Blue Ant Z9 and you will be MUCH happier!"
2,Okay for the Price - Problems syncing,"A okay headset for the price, but ive had cheaper ones that were better.The headset not the additional piece does not fit well in my ear even after adjusting it with the instructions on [...] and constantly feels liek it will fall off. It refuses to work with my computer, after connecting. Vista asks for a driver and as usual it doesnt have one which makes it impossible for me to upgrade the software. Syncs well with my phone but sound quality isn't very good and would possibly be hard to understand for some users."
2,Jabra BT8010 Bluetooth Headset,I'm purchase two Jabra BT8010 Bluetooth Headset. one works okay the other doesn't work properly. I'm not satisfied.
2,Jabra BT8010 review,"The Jabra BT8010 synched up immediately with my Verizon HTC XV6800 PPC phone and both mono and stereo modes worked well. Music and voice quality is very good compaired to my last headset(Jabra BY250). People I call do not complain of poor sound quality on their end either :)However, the unit does not stay in position when I tilt my head and there is no way to make it stay secure...always feels like the earbud is going to fall off when I am moving around.If you use them under a ski hat or something to secure the devices to your ear, it works fine."
4,"big and floppy, good for guys, not for gals","I bought this for my girlfriend along with the iPod bluetooth adapter. It was too big for her ear, but it works good for me. the stereo earpiece is smaller than the main piece and the difference in weight feels a little funky. Sounds really good though."
2,Okay for the Price - Problems syncing,"A okay headset for the price, but ive had cheaper ones that were better.The headset nor the additional piece does not fit well in my ear even after adjusting it with the instructions on[...] and constantly feels liek it will fall off. It refuses to work with my computer, after connecting. Vista asks for a driver and as usual it doesnt have one which makes it impossible for me to upgrade the software. Syncs well with my phone but sound quality isn't very good and would possibly be hard to understand for some users."
2,Okay for the Price - Problems syncing,"A okay headset for the price, but ive had cheaper ones that were better.The headset not the additional piece does not fit well in my ear even after adjusting it with the instructions on Jabra.com and constantly feels liek it will fall off.

Syncs well with my phone but sound quality isn't very good and would possibly be hard to understand for some users."
2,"Great idea, bad design engineering","I thought this headset would be the combo answer to all my needs, and it would have been if i could use it. in a nutshell, this headset would be fantastic if jabra took into account that not everyone has the same head. comparatively i think my head is average and the earhooks are still very uncomfortable and i feel i am constantly trying to get the right fit. unless your head/ear is the size of a child, i believe anyone will suffer the same fate. this is most annoying, to the point i am actually not even using these for the most part anymore. i really hope jabra decides to include an additional size earhook in the future, or at least hooks that are more shapeable to different heads/ears. aside from this the headset is relatively easy to pair and use. only other ? mark would be the audio quality, but i am not complaining about this given the type of product and desired use.I hope this helps anyone out there considering this headset."
2,A terrible dissapointment!,"This is my first bluetooth headset which I decided to purchase because it is actually two products in one; a mono bluetooth headset that converts into a stereo headset. However I have been very dissapointed in this product. Call quality is terrible and the connection is downright unreliable. I attempted to do a firmware upgrade on my first headset and it would no longer work after that and had to be exchanged. Jabra customer service was a complete waste of time. After receiving my second BT8010, I wish I had just returned it for a different product all together. The caller ID doesn't work; it switches to music mode even when you don't won't it too and it is very bulky and uncomfortable. I unfortunately have heard that it takes several tries to find the right fit with bluetooth headsets. I will keep trying."
5,"Love it, use it every day","Honestly, just skip the search and just buy this product. As soon as the next generation comes out (hopefully with a little better sound quality, but its pretty solid as it is). Seriously, just buy it."
1,Not for Verizon,"If you want a bluetooth headset for a Motorola Verizon, it's not this one. When you want to listen to music, this does not work at all. Save your sixty bucks everyone and don't get it.Better off with Motorola only products and that's what I'm sticking with from now on."
4,El accesorio es muy bueno en general y el precio tambien,"En general es muy buen producto, lo unico que tiene de inconveniente es que el auricular es un poco grande y a veces podria molestar en el oido (al principio mas), es facil de configurar ya sea con el Celular o Laptop.Lo recomiendo para viajar ampliamente."
3,The Destruction of a Great Nation,"Blood Orchid is a seething look at events that have led, and continue to lead this country to utter destruction. Bowden seems to foam at the mouth like a rabid dog as he talks of our inability to stop the disease that is slowly annihilating the country and all who come in contact with it. Most disturbing are the people who are doing this. Unknown to most, the enemy is close, senses death, and is waiting to devour the carcass of a once great nation. This book is a must read for anyone who thinks we are living in a perfect world."
2,Blood orchid,"Charles Bowden's book , Blood Orchid, can be seen as a book that rails upon the vilence and seriuos disregard of humankind. The author's reflection upon the Blood Orchid , a plant of dubious character, can be seen as a reflection of man kind itself and its disregard for all creation. Through the eyes of the native American, Bowden relates the loss of spiritual as well as the tempral well being. Dark and moody, the related subject matter goes from atomic destruction to insider trading. It demintrated the reality that, "" everything is for sale."" Strong, painful and forthright Bowden's Blood Orchid wrinches the soul and rveals hidden truths that enlightens, but often frightens."
2,IT JUST DOES NOT HAVE IT,"Very few books I start that I just cannot finish. This, I admit, was one of them. I did give it two stars because the author does have a way with words, but that is about it. This is quite typical of some of the junk writing which came out of the 60s and 70s as a result of one too many acid trips. You kind of have to feels sorry for the author. He must be a rather sad and miserable sort of an individual. Just about anyone with an ounce of observance in them can find things to whine and rant about...the author takes this to new heights. I would strongly suggest the author drive another 7,000 thousand miles and take another look. I suppose if you are a sort of ""anti-everything-guy or gal"" type, you might find this work interesting. Myself, I found the work to be depressing and not all that coherent. I cannot recommend this one."
4,"The newest ""notes from the underground"" by Charles Bowden","Charles Bowden's ""Blood Orchid"" saturates his readers with honest,stream of consciousness reality from the depths of his cynical,twisted mind.Graphic sexual references hide around every corner tempting readers to find out what is this guy up to.Injections of candid truths relating Charles Keating are fascinating forays into our economic standards and the monsters created by a free market society.Stories don't get more brutal that this without real blood.A good read for those that understand their own capabilities,limitations,and appreciate the ugly potential of being human.Dostoyevsky would have been proud."
4,A dark book with an even darker story,"Charles Bowden's book Blood Orchid presents the twisted almost horrifying story of America's sordid past using the Blood Orchid as an extended metaphor to illustrate the self-destructive nature in American excess, pollution, materialism and even sexuality. Comparisons have been drawn between Bowden and Jack Kerouac, but where Kerouac's stories aspire toward Dharma, Bowden's is more Hell-bent. His writing lacks the optimism of Kerouac's but possesses an inherent wisdom and although his message of destruction is foreboding, it is a timely one. In light of recent events, this book should be required reading for anyone whose patriotism has blinded them to the faults of the American way of life."
3,perplexing and tiring,"I have loved the essays I have read by Charles Bowden individually. Whether disturbing or provocative, he grabs you somewhere deep and won't let go. In a full length book, it is feeling too intense for me. The themes of our destruction of the earth and our intransigencies in our history keep returning and returning like the tide. As does the metaphor/image of the orchid. I didn't get very far into the book, I confess. I think I will have to let this one mellow on the bookshelf for a few years or a decade. Maybe then I will be angry enough to feel with along with it, or otherwise patient enough to let it come to me."
3,Can't loan to a friend.,"I love this book, and now own both the paperback, and kindle version.Sadly, I'm not allowed to loan the kindle version to my friends, so I knocked off two stars for that. I'm tempted to give it only one star, but hopefully the author and publisher might actually read my comments to know how angry it makes me to not be able to loan a book I paid for (twice). Sure its cheap enough that people I recommend it to could just buy, but should my wife have to buy another copy, just to have it on her kindle as well (Yes I'm a guy, and I have a few favorite romance reads :P)?"
1,Dixie's DVD Reviews,"I threw this disc into the trash after just one viewing. At this concert Cura was dripping with arrogance from every pore. He is not good enough for such behavior. I was appalled, and never again will I turn my attention to this little Nothing!"
4,A look behind the scene,"Mr. Taber takes the reader inside the wine world with respect to judging, production and history. At The Berwick Wine Company we have made this required reading as it personalizes the winemakers and creators of the wine world. The reader should also note the difficulty in judging wine, which hasonly become more difficult as the critics pull the terrior out of the vineyard forcing winemakers to stylize their wine for the export markets."
5,Great Read and a great gift,"I bought 2 of these books for our annual family wine tasting contest. We set a category (ie, Pinot Noir and Savignon Blanc) and then blind taste for Best Red and Best White. The books were a huge hit for our winners. I had heard about this event for many years but never actually read the details until this very interesting book. ESL Charleston,SC"
4,Judging Paris,"This is much more than Taber's account of the actual historic French/California taste-off. It is really an indepth look at the beginnings of the post-Prohibition California wine industry, especially the quality winemakers who were trying to do much more than provide good jug wines. There are wonderful family histories, anecdotes, analysis of wine marketing, and much more.If you have only seen the film ""Bottle Shock,"" you should read this book to see what really happened. It's a fun film but more fictional than factual."
5,Enjoy your wine more with a dose of history,"This book is so informative, full of facts, details and historical events, that you will learn much more than you expected. I thought it would be dry and dull; on the contrary it is so well-written that the pages fly by. You won't be disappointed with this book."
3,"good, but flawed","This book provides a good history of the rise of the California wine market and international wine competition. It could, however, have been a little better written and organized. I found that the repetition of wine making descriptions broke the flow of the story, but I did appreciate the information about the scientific advances. I enjoyed the stories of the pioneering wine makers, but so much of their stories were dragged out and then huge gaps were left out. Also, some of the stories did not directly relate to the competion and some of the wineries that were in the competition were given short shrift at the end. Still, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of American wine making."
4,"Gosh, Wine in recent historical perspective","The story of people in the American wine industry and the wines themselves gaining international respect is documented here. This is a story that details the intersting people in the wine industry and literally the fruits of their labors. Wine is a a result of a combination of a crop that survives to harvest despite the threats of frosts , droughts and all the extremes the seasons can throw at the grower. Then the grapes are at the mercy of a vinter combining his knowledge of chemistry with experience and taste to provide us with a wonderful bottled elixer. Last year the best wine at an internation tasting was from SchillingBridge Winery in Nebraska, proving that this story of shocking the world of wine can be repeated!"
4,a seminal event,"Just as July 4, 1776 is celebrated as our independence day the blind wine tasting in Paris 200 years later is rightly celebrated as the day that California earned its much deserved place in the Pantheon of great wine producers. This event represented the culmination of many hard struggles by the wine makers of Napa. Mr.Taber cleverly describes the events leading up to the competition and all oenophiles will enjoy this book like a fine glass of cabernet sauvignon. Cheers."
4,wine aficionado,"Judgment of Paris, was excelent easy reding book. Gives good information for wine lovers.Makes you think abouth all new posibilitys and why now so many countrys make wine"
5,outstanding book on wine.,"not only does this book cover the title topic, but the history of american wine. in particular ,it covers calif. wine vs.france vs the world. i liked the section on n.z. and aust. the best. i could just see the faces of the judges. loved the book. jack"
4,A story that changed the world of wine.,Great story about the individuals and times leading up to the wine event that reshaped the global wine industry. A great read.
4,Pretty good information,"Written from an American's perspective, this book is a good overview not just of the famed ""Judgment of Paris"" but of the entire California wine scene in the 1960s and 1970s. Those were wild times in the Napa Valley, with equal parts experimentation and fermentation. The personalities of the winemakers (I hate that word) are described in some detail. The wines themselves are not described in any great detail, however, but perhaps such descriptions are best left to wine critics and not journalists."
3,What about the rest of the wineries?,"This book is second to none for learning about wine and California's rich history making it. However, it could be easily beat. It was disappointing to see that it's focus was primarily Napa. Napa was not the only CA region represented at the tasting, but wineries such as Chalone (Salinas Valley), Ridge, and David Bruce (Santa Cruz Mountains) were only given a page or so in the book. Wineries not at the tasting were discussed, but contrary to popular belief, the CA wine world does not revolve around Napa. What about Paso Robles or Temecula? The state's oldest winery (DeRose, in Hollister) was not mentioned. What about the very old zinfandel roots of Amador county? The grapes at Kirigin (in Gilroy) were planted in the mid-1800s. But in this book, the rest of the state just didn't seem to matter. Sad."
2,Judgement of Paris,As a winemaker in the Napa Valley and knowing many of the people in the book I found it pleasureable reading. I believe anyone who is interested in wine will find it a great read!Gus Anderson Owner/Winemaker Eagles Trace
2,"Note, Item is in white not in Yellow like the picture","I was very disappointment when I get the Cup Set, has the picture are not represent the actual Cup that there are in White (has describe) not in yellow, it can be my fault.. But still that is wrong that they cheating in with the picture, because my interest in the cup was because of the yellow color."
1,PSP Sound System,I did not like this product as it did not line up with the psp system I brought in 2007. It does not work like it was advertised. I would not recommend this product
4,Sounds Like...,"I think this is a great product, the sound is great and its pretty compact and it gets the job done well."
5,This is a beautiful book about how to talk to God,"Prayers on My Pillow is a way to talk to yourself and to God about every problem you have ever had. It makes you feel better just by opening the book to any page. I am 15. I am not very religious. I have lots of problems. My mom got me this book. I love it. I have never done a book report before except in school so I apologize if this is sort of simple minded but you got to read this book. I wish my mom had given it to me last year when I was really depressed, but I am glad I have it now"
5,This is the perfect gift from mother to daughter,"I bought this book because I could relate to the introduction where Celia Straus explains how she had trouble communicating with her teenage daughter and started writing poems to express what she wanted to say. How many mothers suddenly find they cannot talk to their daughters and their daughters won't talk to them? Every mother I know who has a daughter in her early teens is experiencing this problem. Prayers On Your Pillow offers the perfect solution. A book of prayers written like poems that, because they were written for Celia's daughter, appeal to all girls. My daughter loved this book. She reads it every night. And best of all, we are talking again. I owe it all to Prayers On My Pillow."
4,Wow..this sounds just like SoulSex,"it's really interesting to find out that there may be two artists that are so alike, but maybe it's not that either. Well, this CD is fabulous, and in fact, reminds me of one that I found at this location.www.yahoogroups.com/group/SoulSexSeries/You will find them to both be vital and helpful for you in your search for true and divine sensual and sexual release.Kynthia Mona Kali"
3,THE ENYA OF EROTICA MUSIC!,the music is so soothing. it really gets my boyfriend and i movin when i pop this cd in. i only gave it 3 stars because i expected more vocals to be present in the tracks. such as moanings and whisperings.
4,Good introduction to being an executor or trustee,"If you've been named as an executor of an estate and like me know nothing of what that job entails, then you have to start somewhere, right? Is this the best book out there? I don't know, I wasn't going to try all of them and I'm not an attorney (if I was I wouldn't need this book) so I can't judge the quality of the advice. What I can say is that I found it to be an excellent starting place and I know a LOT more now than I did before I read it. I now have a map to follow and a plan to deal with this, which is really all that I wanted to get from this book."
4,Useful and Practical Information,"I bought this book becuase I am a Successor Trustee. Overall, the book is quite helpful, but most information pertains to probating a will. Information on settling a trust seems not as thorough, but has been very useful nonetheless in framing questions I feel the need to contact an attorney on, thus saving some money by focusing issues. It also gives some welcome peace of mind that you aren't totally clueless about what needs to be done, and for that resaon alone is worth the price."
2,Helpful but repetitious and ultimately insufficient,"On almost every page we are reminded that we must be honest. Give me a break. On the other side of the detail spectrum, there are a lot of dead ends, e.g. where one must fill out a form, but not send it to anyone. The main thing this book did for my cluster of heirs was put us all into a frame of agreement, i.e. we all bought the book, so we all had the same information. If the executor was not keeping up with something, the rest of us knew to send a reminder. But in the end, we decided to hire a lawyer to do the job. He knew a lot of stuff that wasn't in the book. What a relief."
4,"Better to consult an attorney, but this book can help","I personally think this topic is too complex to tackle without an attorney, but if you have already decided to do it yourself, then this book is a great resource and has lots of good information. Or even if you are using an attorney, this book can help you understand the process."
1,executor,PA state inhertince tax book tells you everything in this book for free and it is available for download from the state. I wish I had not bought the book.
1,never got the book!,never arrived and no response from seller when sent email. Good thing I bought a used copy!
5,Excellent Resource!,Anyone facing losing a loved one and having to deal with settling an estate or trust should buy this book. I recommend getting a copy before you are faced with a loss that way you will clearly know what steps to follow before you are in the overwhelming emotional pain a death can bring. It is a very comprehensive guide covering every angle of this daunting task. This is a simply written and easy to understand. I highly recommend it.
2,Worked good... for a while,"When i bought my zen i knew i wanted to get a case for it, so i bought this one, the factory creative one. It worked good for a few months, and then the velco stoped holding together. Besides that it was ok. If only Creative had made a case for the zen vision m like the did for the zen x-fi, which has a case with a magnets insted of velcro."
3,"Durable, but not as practical for some use","Used for about 6 months now.Looks good, durable leather, appears to be made with decent quality and stitching.I tend to remove the player from the case a lot, and found that over time, very very light scratches could be seen on the plastic front (I have a black color player). I have a screen protector on the LCD, so that has shown no damage, but the fine scratches on the player appear to be from the case itself (looks to be the stitching and edges on the inside of the case. I would almost fault the player itself, since I have felt the case, and there are no sharp edges, so if the player truly scratches with that little of abrasion I would question the plastic not the cover.Otherwise, has protected the player well in my large bag, as it bounces around daily with a lot of other heavy items (water bottle, lunch, ect). Openings leave easy access to all buttons and cord openings. If you don't remove it from the case often I would recommend."
4,not sure,"I'm not sure what I' should think about the DVD. My greatest problem is the minor quality of this DVD. The wrestlers are quite good, especially Lufisto is very interesting. There is a lot of typical high fly action and a lot of Lucha libre. But there is only one single match and a lots of Tag Team bouts. My problem is, i don't know much of these guys and there were no psychological moments. There was no moment I could say "" oh my god"".Hope you get my message, because I'm from germany."
3,"Some of Cole's Best Songs, But Not the Best CD","The selection of songs is very good, but not as good as the selection on ""The Legendary Nat King Cole"" CD, and ""Legendary"" gives you 24 songs versus 20 on this CD. The two CDs have 11 songs that are the same. For someone who is looking for a single Nat King Cole CD, I would recommend ""Legendary"" over this one.I was disappointed that remastering didn't remove more of the record noise in most of the Nat King Cole Trio tracks. I was able to remove almost all of the noise with my little home editor. Outside of the residual record noise, the tracks sounded good.I was also disappointed that there was studio chatter on a couple of the tracks. This might be entertaining the first time that a CD is played, but it loses its appeal later. I also removed the chatter for my music files."
2,Great performance in atrocious sound,"For $7 I was excited to be obtaining a famous live performance at a bargain price, one in which Tebaldi was so feted by the audience that the tenor, Lauri-Volpi, reportedly became annoyed! Gobbi sounds magnificent, too, when you can hear him through the appallingly poor sound. Unfortunately, I found that the sonic deficits got in the way of pure musical enjoyment. The conductor, Santini, also has a propensity for excessive forward movement, which can be detrimental to the more intimate pages (e.g compared to Beecham). I cannot recommend this, even given that I own and enjoy countless ancient historical recordings. If a superior sounding source turned up, I might consider trying it again, but in the meanwhile I would stick with either the de los Angeles/Bjorling/Beecham or the Callas."
3,Thank God Benny don't look like this no more,"This is the homeliest, most god-awful picture of Benny Green I can imagine. I have no doubt that he once looked this dorky, but, thank god he now has at least gotten rid of the mustache. His hair is still a little strange, but getting rid of the mustache, losing a little weight, and getting older have done wonders for him. He still looks 17 onstage unless you're in the first few rows, so you can understand why he had a mustache, but it clearly wasn't worth it. Maybe a duellng scar or something. Haven't heard the album, but the cover sucks. Benny should buy them all up and burn them (the covers, not the CDs). Helluva piano player."
1,Buyer Beware of recording date.,"I would have loved to hear this CD in High Fidelity, which did exist when this music was recorded in 1965. If you want a quality recording, you will not find it here. I can only blame myself for not looking closer at the recording date. This analog recording (ADD) sounds as if I were listening to it on my old 8 Track or cassette player. Very disappointed for sure.After reading the CD liner notes, I notice that this ""eloQuence"" series is a budget re-release of classical music. Had I known this in the very beginning, I would have chosen another label with a higher quality production."
4,Wanna laugh? Try this book!!,"I have read several books by this author, Patricia Smiley.They are fun, entertaining and always make me laugh.And, after all, Laughter is the best medicine, it ispriceless and benefits you in many ways.So, give this book a try......"
4,Her dreams of success get diverted by lawsuits and murders,"Tucker Sinclair has worked hard to be make a name for herself as a financial consultant at the firm of Aames & Associates. Tucker anticipates negotiating big deals and a partnership for herself. It goes horribly wrong when a financial contract written for Dr. Milton Polk and his dreams of his diagnostic testing facility go missing and he ends up dead. Tucker is suspended from work for a week. Tucker recently divorced, has her mother and her beloved dog living with her. Tucker struggles also with feelings for her ex-husband Eric. At the same time, she has to fend off attempts by her bitter Aunt Sylvia to take her beach house away from her. Tucker reluctant but determined to avoid jail time goes on the hunt to find out what happened to Dr. Polk. Being an inexperienced sleuth, she has to work her way out of some very awkward moments. A fun, well-written novel with potential as a future series."
3,Definite Summer tunes,Upbeat almost to the point of being annoying. Tracks like Break Your Neck will give you the irrestible urge to dance like a fool.Great album if you like this kind of thing.
4,It's a Classic,A lot of John Willys sexploitation cartoons are redundant and they are all here so the volume seems a little padded. That said it's a lovely volume. The vintage bondage is very nice there are several really classic plot lines - Ok it's must for vintage bondage fans. If you're looking for hardcore cartoons or bondage you need to look elsewhere. Glad I bought it.
3,Disappointing Story Line,"OK-P D James writes great stuff and Dalgliesh is a great ""COP"".Problem here is storytakes too long to unfold (Dalgliesh shows up midway through with no ""sidekick"".) Local police are incompetent,except for a Sgt who we see a few times.So nointelligent give and take that helps the viewer.Almost all characters seem extraneous,and deaths could either be murder or suicide (and which doesn't matter much). Thevillian stands out as unusual right away,and I can't see how his criminal activityis on a large enough scale to support his lifestyle.A big plus is the exciting ending.See my other reviews of P D James DVDs;there are some great plots elsewhere."
2,Better than Ambien . . .,"If you have trouble sleeping, this series is guaranteed to put you into a deep slumber--with no harmful side effects! The soothing power of stiff British dialogue delivered by what must surely be wax figures (or possibly zombies?) is really quite unparalleled as a soporific. When you add editing that makes an 8-year-old with a camcorder look like Steven Spielberg, even the most stressed-out Wall Street broker will doze off.Highly recommended as a sedative. (Use only as directed.)"
4,Textbook like reading...,It's a little hard to sit and read a book that is written much like a text book but the book itself is informative and opens your eyes to the possibilities of preventing reading difficulties.
1,Trailer hitch for 79- 93 mustang,I decided not to install this hitch on my mustang because it required me to cut a large square out of face of the rear bumper cover to mount the hitch to the steel bumper underneath. I would not recommend this hitch to anyone with a Ford Mustang or Mercury Capri. My Dad put a different brand hitch on his '83 Mercury Capri many years ago and it didn't require any cutting of the plastic bumper cover.
1,Not what is showed in picture.,This hitch is cheap. I would not trust it to pull a bike.It is not at all what they show you in the picture.Valley 58710 Class 1 Hitch
2,Not so complete,"The Complete Bike Book falls short of the book's title. The book is lavishly illustrated with color photos on virtually every page. As an informal treatment on the subject of bicycling, it does an average job. While the book tries to cover everything from road biking to mountain biking, the information is scarce and only provides thumbnail glimpses of each topic that is covered. Most of the photographs seem rather dark and underexposed. This may be a result of the publisher not keeping an eye out on quality control. This book is rather expensive and thin. For the price of this book, you would probably do better to purchase ""Richard's 21st Century Bike Book"" which does a much better job of covering bicycling."
2,"An expensive ""Coffee Table"" book","This book has lots and lots of pictures but is more of a coffee table book than a serious bicycle book. It tries to cover all sorts of topics about biking but in doing so, it dilutes each subject that it covers. The Complete Bike Book is well illustrated but low on indepth information. If you like nice picture books, this may be a good purchase, but considering the price and the rather skimpy content, I would seriously consider another book about bicycles."
2,"""Heated Pizza""","I was very disappointed with this album. I was pretty anxious to get it, being a fan of AWOL records. When I finally did get it though, it was all hype. Pizza has nuttin new 2 offer, just a lame impression of some of his other labelmates - C-bo and Killa Tay. The beats are all wack; Pizza's flow is dull and even worse than his beats. If it wasn't for track 9) Fully Heated w/ B-Legit, I would have given this album 1 star. Track 9) Fully Heated is a decent cut, but not great - definately not worth scrappin up 12 bucks for the whole album. If you want a good AWOL release, checkout ""Killa Tay: Mr. Mafioso,"" which was also released in 1998."
1,NOT THRILLED,THEY ARE VERY LONG..DIDN'T REALIZE IT WHEN I ORDERED THEM..AND THE SILVER DISK IS VERY CHEAP LOOKING..ALMOST JUNK JEWELRY LOOKING..
2,uneven browning and too slow,"I asked for this for christmas. I had read the good and bad reviews and thought I would take a chance and hope for a good toaster. But I didn't get one. The browning elements do not light up evenly by appearance and the toast is much darker on one side than the other using the right two slice side. The left two slice side seems to work much better but it is so slow the bread is dried out by the time it is toasted. I am used to moist bread on the inside and toasted on the outside, not with this toaster, just dry all the way through. My mother got a Kitchenaide for a little more money and loves it. I am going to exchange mine for that brand. Don't chance it, buy something else. T-Fal has a poor design and poorer quality control."
1,DISAPPOINTING...,"This was a very disapointing purchase. First it is an attractive machine. The bagel toaster part works great. However, that is about it. You have to watch your hands, because the top chrome is not covered around the edges like other toasters and it gets very hot.Unfortunately, the elements to toast do not, unless you are just using the bagel function. It takes awhile to toast.The joke in my family is that I purchased the energy saver toaster. The elements started to go after 4months. The only person who has been happy with the toaster has been the family beagle. The angled slots look neat, but only serve to propel smaller slices of bread out & over the counter into the waiting mouth of the dog..."
1,Disappointment,"My sister-in-law has this toaster and I thought hers did a good job. So, I buy one and I'm thoroughly disappointed. It toasts unevenly - one side gets dark the other is still soft AND it also toasts unevenly on the same side! The top is close to burnt and the bottom is o.k. Definitely not worth the money."
2,No way to repair,"I purchased this toaster because of styling and features. However, after two years of moderate use, one set of heating coils stopped working. Normally this should be a straightforward repair (clean, repair, or replace elements).However, when dismantling the appliance, it was clear that T-Fal never intended that the product be repairable. The heating elements are thin strips of delicate material. Furthermore, the interior, including electronic components, was completely contaminated with crumbs. There were no adequate baffles to partition toasting area from controls area. Clearly, this is not an appliance that will last long."
2,"SLOW - Keep looking, just because it look cool doesn't mean it works.","This is the slowest toaster I've ever used! It's cool looking, but doesn't work well. It's also really confusing on how to pop the toast up early. Keep looking, you can do better."
2,Just one more bad review to add to the list,Uneven toastinglevers on front for removing toast start to malfuction after about a year.I think that says enough
1,"Great looks, great features, lousy toast!!","When we first saw this toaster we loved the design. However, after trying and returning 3 different toasters, we've given up. In all 3 the elements do not heat up evenly thus giving patchy toast not to mention taking a long time. When we purchased this toaster, I read the Amazon reviews and only saw one negative one and felt it was probably atypical. Guess I was wrong, because I now see many that are exactly as I've experienced..."
2,too slow; slots not long enough,"Disappointing:- The slots are not quite long enough. When I put bread in (and it's normal-size bread, not that big), the bread usually sticks in the ""up"" position because it's too big to drop down, and I have to force it down with my hand.- It toasts too slowly. I have it set to toast only medium darkness, and yet it still takes at least twice as long as my old toaster did."
2,"Lots of hype, little show",Bought this toaster after doing a lot of research on 4 slice toasters. This seemed to be the safest bet. Unfortunately I have had same problems as other users. Not all the coils work so it toasts unevenly. The lift up feature sometimes gets stuck. My husband complains that it takes too long to toast. I've had this for about 8 months and will be sending back under warranty.
2,T-Fal Toaster experience,Toaster does not brown evenly front side to back side nor piece to piece even though toaster settings are the same. Very disappointed.
1,Wasted money & bread,"Toast pops out of the unit,(into the sink or on the floor), too many out side edges to collect crumbs,uneven toasting, too high a unit price !"
2,Terrible at toasting,"Don't let the good looks fool you. This toaster is better at being counter-top decor than toasting. The left side toasts unevenly - brown on the bottom, soggy on the top, and the right side only toasts when the knob is cranked to full. Very bad toaster, look elsewhere."
2,It's Huge!,"It's just a toaster. Fancy controls and stuff, but I don't need it to do anything other than toast. My big complaint with it is its size. The thing is huge!"
5,"Great toaster, good value.","Toaster is as advertised. Only complaint I have is the cord being so short, but that is apparently due to some government regulation so I cannot fault the manufacturer.Read the directions when you receive it because they recommend putting it through one toast cycle in order to 'break in' the heating elements. Toaster generates a significant amount of heat so make sure you have plenty of free space above where you plan to place it in your kitchen. My cabinet is about 18 inches above the toaster and you can feel that it gets very warm during a toasting, so be safe.Excellent toaster, and it looks great! Well designed."
3,Neat Features but Not Built Well,"Features: 5 Stars Reliability: 2 StarsWe purchased this item in December and by June it wasn't working very well. In all 4 slots one side of the heating elements stopped working. Thus, to cook the toast evenly one needs to turn the bread over half way through the toasting cycle which is a pain. May not be a problem for bagels or muffins if you are primarily cooking only one side of the bread. The tilt design is nice as the crumbs fall through a slot and into a lower pannel which keep them from burning. Crumbs plate is easily removed and cleaned. The defroster and re-heating features work well. I'd give it 5 stars if the unit was built to last, but I hate buying a new toaster every 6 to 12 months."
2,"beautiful design ,but didn't perform well","This toaster is a work of art in its design,but mine had a lot of problems. the heating elements buckle way out here and there when toasting,overbrowning some spots and leaving others completely untoasted!One slot browned only one side of the bread. Also, it took literally twice as long to toast anything as my old two slot that I'm replacing and the toast is utterly dried out by the time it pops up. I like the design so much that I may re-order to see if another works better,but with all the shipping costs I may just buy at a local store."
2,Whoops!,"I enjoy a good toaster waffle in the morning.. unfortunately, this toaster seems to have been designed with dense rasin bread or bagels in mind. The waffles literally leap out of the toaster and land, typically, behind the fridge. Not good breakfast food. Maybe the spring in my toaster is just wound too tight, or maybe you like hunting behind the fridge for breakfast. Anyway, watch this toaster like a hawk and bring your catcher's mitt or else buy a cheaper, less frisky toaster."
1,Very Poor Toaster,I have had this toaster for 2 months now. The lift buttons jam and you have to use them to get normal size bread out. It toasts poorly and unevenly. Bottom line is I am already looking to replace it.
1,All SHOW...NO TOAST!,Large chrome boat anchor. Lift knob broke shortly after purchase. Makes toast at the speed of a crippled snail. Inconsistant browning. Sorry I wasted my time. Major dissappointment. Try a magnifying glass.
1,Works fine---NOT!,"No problems with the toaster. Bought for my wife as a Christmas present. She likes everything about it except that ""doesn't go with our kitchen decor"" She wishes it was white instead of black.7/8/02 update. The toaster failed after only 7 months of not that heavy use. My wife won't let me buy any more toasters!"
5,Best Toaster Ever!,We purchased the 4 slot T-fal and could not be happier. I would recommend this toaster not only for its terrific performance but also for its looks. Great for Bagels! Buy it you you'll love it.
1,What A Disappointment,Takes forever to toast on even the lightest setting. Disappointed that the slots are not long enough to accommodate anything but square slices of bread without forcing it down in the slot. All of the elements didn't light up so toasting was uneven. The only two positives are the beautiful design and the bread doesn't get dried out or hard in the toasting process.
1,What a mistake,"I purchased this toaster and I hate it. It takes forever to toast anything and never comes out the way it should. Like many items, it looks good, but doesn't work well. It is far too expensive for something that doesn't work."
2,uneven toasting,I bought this toaster nearly a year ago. After six months it began toasting unevenly. Not happy with this as I have to flip the bread in order to toast it all over. I wouldn't waste my money on this one again!
2,"Looks Good, Works Not","This toaster looks great, and we were pleased to receive it as a gift ... that is until we actually used it. The elements are too slow, the top half of the toast burns (smokes, even), while the bottom stays nice and cool--the heat escapes up due to the ""handy"" bagel width--and now none of the buttons do anything, so all I can do is warm a bagel. The ""reheat"" and ""bagel"" settings/lights are permanently on, the right toast lifter is defective, and the right control sticks. I'm wondering if the browning control knobs are connected to anything, now. maybe it's just a Fisher-Price toy that T-Fal accidentally marketed as an actual toaster. Now, the Avante just sits in the closet; if city folk come visit, we pull it out and prop it up beside the espresso machine so's we look high falutin. And at least I know our smoke alarm works."
4,good Starter clips,"With free shipping only, this is a great set to see if you like the whole concept of toe clips. I still haven't decided to go all the way with clips, but this set gives me plenty of experience. Just wait till you want to buy something else that will bring the total to 25 bucks or more, for free shipping."
3,"it is okay, but need thin shoes to use with it","It is okay. It works, if you use thin soled shoes. Otherwise, it will not fit right and your toes will get numb."
5,"Lightweight, wont damage shoes like metal",Had standard metal clips with straps before...got these because i didnt want straps and the metal clip without straps damaged my shoes and just wasnt that good. These are light and provide enough stability to keep your shoe in the pedal without straps
2,"Not for me ,","I bought these for my spare ATB , and the cage height is far too short to accommodate the toes of my size 10 riding boots. Might work for sneakers or dainty little riding shoes , but if you wear a hiking boot for offroad cycling like I do , avoid these. I have some old Specialized toe clips of a similar design , and they are plenty tall enough to accommodate my boots , so I guess these will go into the ""unused/unsuitable"" bin...."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I received these clips from Amazon today. As noted in other reviews, there were no instructions with the clips. Because of the particular pedal that I have (Sunlite Bicycle Clipless I) I had some difficulity getting the retaining nut on. There was not enough room on the back side of the pedal to get any type of wrench on the nut and it was rather hard to hold the nut by hand while trying to tighten it. However, after getting the lock nut snugged fairly tight by hand, I was able to tighten the fastener enough that I felt it was secure. Again, this was on a particular type pedal. Maybe other pedals might not be so hard. I was not too impressed with the flexibility of the clip. This may not be a problem but my perception is that it would not take hard use. Having said that, I have not used the clips yet so I may change my mind after riding for a hundred miles or so."
1,Won't work with mountain bike reflector pedals,"These might be easy to install - if you have the right pedals. If your pedals have reflectors both front and back - and no pair of drill holes front or back - you won't be able to install them. I have three bikes - all various sizes of kids mountain bikes, including a 24/26 in one - and they all have the same dual reflector pedals."
2,where's the instructions???,"much to my disgust; for something that seemingly was suppossed to be so easy to install, due to there being absolutely no instructions (or picture guides), i am forced to take my bike to a shop 10 miles away in order for them to install them? i feel like an idiot? i have a degree in architecture, and 25 years experience in civil engineering :)! per an earlier review, my reflectors will also need to be slid out, and then have holes drilled into he pedal. not exactly what i had in mind when i purchased this item? for the most part i've been pleased with my pacific gray bicycle, but have experienced on many occassions ""shifting-of-gears"" without my doing so? this too can be slightly dangerous. however; the color combo of blue and gold are exceptional! additionally; i have bolted on a tire pump...a water bottle...a combo headlight/flasher...small back carrier bag...and a considerably more comfy schwinn bicycle seat. thank you, and i hope i have been of some help? steelersteve"
4,Great alternative to cleats and clip in pedals,"If I had put these on my bicycle instead of clip in pedals I would have saved $30, 000 having my shoulder repaired. While it's true that you won't get the efficiency of clip in pedals, they are more than adequate for recreational riding. Much easier to get in and out of too."
1,mount plate holes too small,"I bought these but the mount plate holes were too small for the screws that were provided. For a $10 item, it was a real hassle to deal with ordering, waiting, trying, filing refund request, shipping back, etc. just poor manufacturing."
4,Affordable workable solution for more pedal power,"A friend was nice enough to loan me a set of these for a sprint triathlon in July. After I used them, I decided I needed to order a pair for myself. Easy to install, easy to use. I don't have a ton of road bike experience (not ready for cleats/clipless pedals) so these have helped with riding, training and racing. Used them for another sprint tri this past weekend. They're holding up well so far. No complaints."
4,They work well,"A great buy in my eyes. Very easy to assemble to the pedals I already had on my bike. They were comfortable on my feet as I rode and keep them in place, which was the reason I got them in the first place."
4,Exactly what they look like,"Less secure then Toe Clips with straps, but cheaper and easier to get in and out of. Really helps in positioning the foot, and provides some return on the up-stroke of the peddle. If what you are doing is quick trips where mounting and dismounting the bicycle occurs often, then these are for you. If you are starting to stretch out your distance, then perhaps Toe Clips with straps (or even clip-less peddles) are right for you (but be prepared to pay more for those options)."
4,Good but no directions,"Somebody else mentioned that there are no directions. I guess there aren't too many ways these things could go on. But most cheaper pedals have reflectors front and back, so I don't think these will work unless you drill through the reflector to mount them. There are bolts included to attach the clip to a small metal plate that I assume then is attached to the front edge of the pedal. Amazonneeds to get the manufacturer to add instructions. But the clips look good, and they are a good idea, and they shipped in just 3 days. So.....you may have to to some modification to get them to work, but it might be worth it."
4,Just right,"If you're not looking to spend a lot on toe clips, these are the way to go. They are cheap-ish plastic but I think they hold up just fine, are easy to install and get the job done! My feet fit fine (women's size 10-11) and I have no trouble getting in or out of them."
4,pedal clips,I had to modify my pedals slightly for the clips to fit. If you're handy this will be no problem.These clips are an intermediary step to the more advanced (and expensive) shoes and clips that bikers usually move up to.I do believe they are helping me ride faster.
1,Pretty much worthless.,"I thought these would be a great addition to my commuter. I ended up removing them after one ride. These might be fine if you have tiny feet, but I found them to not fit my size 12s as they flexed and bent. They are now in my junk box, however I may screw them to the wall and use them as tool hangers.I was quite underwhelmed."
4,they work!,"these clips work exactly as advertised...installed easily without need for any add'l. brackets, are comfortable and do the job if you want simple yet effective and most important easy-to-get in and out of clips"
2,Too flexible,Just wanted to try some inexpensive clips out and these clips proved to be just that - they are way too flexible to be truly useful. I thought the plastic would be a bit more rigid.
2,Don't waste your money...,"First of all as mentioned, there are no instructions for this item. However,I did figure out it is attached by taking off the reflector from the pedal.I have no clue what the extra metal piece is for. These clips are not near tight enoughto help with upward stroke or improve power. Worst of all one popped off right in the middleof the road as I was trying to clip in. Save your money for a pair of clipless pedals!"
5,"Great for quick in and out, can take a beating.","I really loved these. I had just gotten into biking so i didn't think i was ready for clipless pedals yet. I wasn't sure about toe cages and straps either as i ride on a main road and would need to be able to stop or start on a dime. These did the trick. They force your feet into the proper position, balls of your feet and not mid foot like i was doing, they hold on so you get the pull up as well as the push down, and you can slip in and out like a dream. I had mine for about a year and they really took a beating. They finally gave out where they were mounted to the pedal, but i think that had more to do with my pedal getting dinged up and warped than anything. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get into biking for fitness or just plain commuting. Great product."
1,fresh look: not so good,"after getting further into the installation and use, my review has been revised to ""worthless item' category. when to a bike shop and got a realistic pair of traps and installed them in less than 30 minutes. save you money. but most importantly, save the aggravation."
4,Simple to use,"I am getting back into biking, and ordered these to use on my newDiamondback Insight 3 Performance Hybrid Bike, 700c Wheels. Although I used full clips with straps in the past, I wanted something a little easier to get out of in traffic. These clips fit the bill. Easy to install, easy to get in/out. There is flex if you pull too hard, but if you are pedaling that hard you need clips with straps anyway."
5,Strapless Toe Clips,"These are easy to install. They are light-weight. And I can wear my wider shoes. If you have a wider shoe size you might want to try these. Also they are very easy to get in and out of, with very little practice."
3,Toe clips are OK,"Bought these for my Trek hybrid bicycle. No installation instructions are included, nor are they on the Delta website. Since my pedals have slide out reflectors on both sides, needed to drill my own holes in the pedals to mount. Since they now recess into the pedal a bit, I can't really position my foot comfortably. With sneakers, they also tend to crush the toes a bit. Not sure if there's anything better, guess I'll manage for now."
2,Kinda tight for my size 11 foot,"These work well enough as described, but they were kind of tight for my size 11 foot in running sneakers. My toes felt cramped and it didn't feel like the ball of my foot was on the pedal.If I had a smaller foot these would be fine. I have used similar toe clips with straps in the past, but I liked this better because there was no strap to adjust."
3,HP LSERJET 2300D,The printer was advertised as refurbished; it was extremely dirty and very worn but it works. I expected it to be in better condition. Network card was not the one originally sold with this model and required reconfiguration to be operational.
2,"Too much jargon, not enough substance","Considered a ""classic"" by Jungians, I found this book to be so filled with Jungian imagery that it was not worth the trouble of wading through it all. The majority of the text is an analysis of The Little Prince, and would be of most value to one who wished to interpret this story.Almost everything of value regarding the psychological image of the puer is available in the first chapter which is reprinted in Reclaiming the Inner Child by Jeremiah Abrams (ed). Here the reader will find an entire section on Eternal Youth and Narcissism including excellent chapters by Joel Covitz (Narcissism), Alice Miller (The Search for the True Self) and Jeffrey Satinover (The Childhood Self and the Origins of Puer Psychology). This last I especially recommend to anyone interested in the puer."
1,Puer Aeternus,This book had profound observations and I fell asleep every 1-2 pages.For me it cured my insomnia. I no longer have a long held desire to readthe Little Prince (or to give a copy to my grandson).
2,Not a coyote,"The toy is cute, but I got it specifically because my 3 year old LOVES coyotes. It is not a coyote. It's a wolf. Comes with a wolf tag. Why on earth would it be named Plush Wily Cyote? Disappointed."
5,Great Gift,Toy was just as advertised. It arrived in a timely manner. I am satisfied with the item and the service.
2,Mixed feelings about this crib.,"I am soon to be a Grandma so I bought this crib for our guestroom. Upon opening the box, I discovered the stationary side rail had several gouges in the wood and several areas with chipped paint. I e-mailed the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a new siderail. I was impressed by their customer service. We proceeded to put it together, which was fairly easy. The color is lovely and I get tons of compliments on how nicely it fits in with the room decor. The only complaint (and it's major) is that we find it extremely difficult to raise and lower the siderail. It takes ALOT of effort and the bed shakes and the legs sway which makes me question the sturdiness of this product. I will keep this crib because it is only for occasional use, and I don't think we will be using the siderail much, but I would not recommend it as the baby's primary bed. I realize that this is a very inexpensive crib and I didn't expect much...but I did expect the siderail to slide up and down."
1,I follow Jesus....and this movie is so offensive it's almost satirical,"I saw this movie a couple months ago and my mouth hung open as I watched it.Aside from the production value which is no better than amateur, the movie is filled with offensive fundamentalist theology that makes Christians look like cold, unloving people...which, granted, many of them are.I'm actually going to rent this movie to show some of my Christian friends because it's so poorly done and so galling that it's funny."
3,Apple iBook G3 500Mhz 128MB 10Gb CDROM 12.1'' OS X OFFICE 2004,"This item, Apple iBook G3 500Mhz 128MB 10Gb CDROM 12.1'' OS X OFFICE 2004 Plus Upgraded Models Available, was late in arriving and it did NOT have an internal modem. This should have been stated."
1,False Item it's not what's in the PICTURE!!!,This Item that says it's a iBook G3 it's not it's a i book clam. Something is wrong with this ad an no one has caught it. Someone like me who really wants one realizes it's not whats in the picture would be pretty ticked. I would say if your selling a i book g3 you mite wanna put the rite picture up there.
1,Incompetent and unresponsive seller,Seller did not respond to my request to cancel my order and shipped it anyway two days after the order was placed.
1,bD BUY,The computer was older than advertised and did not have the network capability that was advertised. The only good thing was that they gave back most of my money when I sent it back 80%.
4,Yay! I now have the ability to pay bills and read email whenever I want...,"I know most people buy one of these small laptops for their children, but I bought this one for myself. As it's older and not currently capable of online video access, my teen isn't all that interested in it. Our main computer has what she needs. But this little thing is fast and perfect for my limited home use (I have computer access at work).I did have a problem with the first shipment, but this gave me a good opportunity to use tech support for Midwest Laptops. They were very responsive and helpful. Couldn't have worked out better. This was a great investment!"
2,Mouse Did Not Move.,"The ad sounded great, but even with downloaded instructions, we could not get the cursor to move and there was no information on keystroke commands. Also, its web connections were not compatible with what we had. Too bad the original instruction manual was not included, it would have made a huge difference."
3,good but slow,it is a good product a little slow but understandable what got me is how long it took to ship and get to me forever.
1,Sucks!,"It was a waste of money ! You can not get a refund too , so Do NOT BUY! Try a more new product!"
4,Awesome!),This computer is the best laptop ever.But i guess would be enjoyed if you are a student ha!)
1,RETURNED - THESE WERE AWFUL!!!!,"these computers fell apart when i opened them. they are not loaded with anything that works for modern day use. the seller was initially helpful, but i wound up having to use my a-z to get my money back. i don't recommend purchasing these unless you have spare parts and are mac-aware for rebuilding."
3,looks good but....,"Fast shipping ,in good condition but the disc tray was damaged and couldnt really watch any youtube videos or any videos at all.contact seller like twice to let him or her know about the problem, did not respond back..would not buy from this seller ever again!!"
2,Beware Buyers,"Bought this computer, what a mistake. Used it for only writing and surfing the net. It literally broke down a few months later, the backlight on my screen died, and it would freeze up on me like every second. Oh, and this is the kicker, when I went to get it fixed the serial numbers were all scratched out. Stolen perhaps...On the brighter side, they did expedit my shipping and I got my computer in a few days. Buyers beware!"
1,How can I return this computer and get my money back?,This turned out to be a much older computer than it said in Amazon site and we dont want it. I have called and e-mailed and East Coast Macs is not responding. We DO NOT want this computer. It arrived a week after Christmas from California. I am afraid if I send it back to the address it came from I will have no money and no computer. I'm not sure what to do.
3,MacLapTop,"I guess it was a good deal for the money? Seems to work alright, no instruction booklet came with the laptop, can't get the internet working yet along with a few other issues...we'll figure it out :) But...all in all, it's a nice laptop and I have faith!"
2,Must Read,this ibook g3 was good at first but then it started getting really slow.. I couldnt download anything at all and after a while it was saying something expierd... i suggest you get this for internet use only and nothing else.. another problem was that itunes wouldnt work ither...
3,Great computer for work purposes!,"Nice, clean computer! It is good for surfing the web, but videos on YouTube load too slow to watch. CD player doesn't work well, either. If all you want is a computer for surfing the web, this is a good one for the price!"
5,"If it relates to signals, L-com has it","The BNC connector is very common. Being able to built one into your project has become more difficult since rat shack quit stocking parts in favor of cell phones. Fortunately Amazon was there to the rescue.There are two types of BNCs that I bought for a project, one that uses a double-D hole to prevent rotation and this flange mount design.In the end my project has a professional appearance as I tapped the case for the 4 screws and drilled a clearance hole for the center conductor to pass through. With so many cables terminated in BNC connectors, having a female BNC to connect to them is almost mandatory if you design circuits on your own.You can also go to L-com and get a catalog of all the RF parts they sell here at amazon. Their shipping is very reasonable so I picked up some other connectors I'd needed in the past."
4,Essential reading for the new house builder.,"I was amazed at the scope of information contained in this book. It opened my eyes to all the things you must keep in mind when creating your new home. All those things you won't realise the significance of till it's to late, they're in this book. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Toshiba MD14H63 14"" FlatScreen TV with Built-In DVD Player",my daughter loves it..she received it for her 13th birthday and was truly happy with the set and the remote. i don't think it could have been better for the price or the service it has offered her...THANKS for the fast shipping too.
1,Okay - sort of but not what I expected,Most of the things are so general and any idiot should know them that I was not impressed with the book. I expected it to give me help on things like - what to do if I have put too much salt in something (like egg salad). The answer was do not add too much salt...really???? Duh!
4,Both Are Geared for the Collector,"""Party"" is a fun album to listen to and it gave the Beach Boys a hit single ""Barbara Ann"". It also includes a medley of their own songs ""I Get Around"" and ""Little Deuce Coupe"". It also features 2 Beatles songs, a Bob Dylan song (done so charmingly bad you forgive them). But this was put out merely to satisfy their contract. 3 stars for this one, but listen only on rainy days.Now for one I prefer: ""Stack-O-Tracks"". This is more for collectors but it's fun to listen to. In one speaker, you have the music instrumentally and in the other, you have the vocals. You can sing along or play along if you can play the guitar or piano. 4 stars for this one, but only for those who like to play with their speakers."
5,Best iPod Decking Station I've Come Across,"The sound from this little machine is amazing. I originally bought an iHome portable station mainly because of the cheap price. However, the old saying of you get what you pay for held true for that product. The sound from the iHome device was awful and after only a month it stopped working properly. Luckily I was able to return it and decided to purchase a new one from an electronic company I trust-Sony. The Sony was more expensive and larger than the iHome but well worth the extra money. Although it's a big larger, it is still quite portable. The only drawback is there is no battery back-up, therefore, an electrical outlet must be accessible. I highly recommend this product. The sound generated from an iPod is excellent, therefore, the amplifier should be just as good. You will not be sorry with this product."
5,Ipod dock,"This was a surprise buy at Target (returned for Amazon savings of $75) one day on a whim, but once hooked up we were amazed with the great sound and bass that come from this little unit. The best part is the option to hook it up to the cable box or dvd player for surround sound with a little system. Just need to buy a $6 splitter from Radio Shack. If you don't have the room for a fully system or don't want the cost, you'll be amazed by this unit b/c of the subwoofer that you can hide."
1,Horrible!,I was hoping for a nice DVD for learning shapes and numbers for my son and this does not fit the bill. The DVD is of low quality. It does not make any sense the way that the numbers and shapes are taught in this DVD. I'll just stick to Brainy Baby and Rock 'N Learn Series to actually teach my toddler and keep his attention. I did not even donate this to the library..to the trash it went.
4,"Edgy, erotic, extraordinary","Pieper's eye is keen. His pen, deft. He writes a quartet of edgy novellas, each borne of a unifying amalgam of deceit, treachery, and contretemps, yet each unique in characterization, pace, and denouement. To look at but one of the four, ""Married Sex"" tells of a man and a woman whose irresistible attraction to each other leads, as dissonant agendas evolve, to a consuming erotic intensity with penetrating psychosexual insights. The characters achieve both more and less than one might ever have imagined. Pieper delivers abundantly on this, his first published work."
4,Superb Writing!,"Just finished Bill Pieper's So Trust Me and literally fell into the stories, getting lost in the beautiful language of each novella. I especially loved the very first, The Willamette Kid. Mr. Pieper has a powerful mastery of his craft. The stories are all rich in detail and a delight to read. I very much look forward to his next book."
4,"T. Graham Brown, You Can't Take It With You","I enjoy the CD very much. However, I did get a great surprise when I decided todownload it into my library of favorites. To my surprise the title showed ""ComeAs You Were"" and the song listing was completely different from what was on my CD. When I played this back after downloading it, I found that it was ""You Can'tTake It With You"" and the songs listed on the CD were correct. I still have notfigured out how I got the foreign title and song listing. As yet I have not foundthe CD but hope to one day.I thoroughly enjoy T. Graham Brown and am slowly collecting his CDs. Finding himwas quite by accident and I consider it a fortunate one. At present I have three,(The Best Of, You Can't Take It With You and The Present) and hope to acquire more in the future. I would like to know more about his life as a performer."
4,Digiview version,The sound and picture quality are good. But on this particular DVD version they replaced the classic whistling theme in the beginning with some piano tune that sounds like it comes from an 80s dramedie. Why they felt the need to replace the original tune is beyond me but it just isn't the same without it.
2,Should have been named differently,"Robin Hood never makes an appearance in this book. But some elements of the original story does. The first half of the book drags, but then picks up and changes pace, it was a good reas then, but not before."
5,I LOVE READING THIS BOOK!!!,"An wonderful adventure with passionate romance in the dark forests of England. Armored Knights, battles, brigands, love, hate, erotic scenes all so well mix up that the action doesn't stop until the last sentence on the last page. Her extraordinary characters –as usual- make this a wonderful and lovely book! You’ll love it as I did. Imposible to put it down until the end."
3,If you have nothing better to do,"I got 60 or 70% through before I decided to find something else to read, and I very rarely stop a book I've started reading. It's not awful, just not as great in my opinion as all the reviews promised."
3,Exciting and Romantic but.....,"This book was pretty good! It was full of adventure and fun characters... I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the sex and abuse. I know those things might have been a reality in those days.. I just don't care reading so much about it. I don't really need a play-by-play on the sex positions. I also felt like it was almost too descriptive. I found myself kind of skimming the paragraphs to get the idea, and then get into the conversations.The romance is good, the characters were well-developed, and the plot played out well! If you don't like reading about the sex, then just be ready to turn some pages a few times..."
5,Wonderful Romantic Read!!!,"I just finished reading ""Through a Dark Mist."" What a wonderful romantic read! I couldn't put this one down. Not sure how I missed reading this book years ago. I was going through my bookshelf of to-be-read books and found this one. I have a bad/good habit of buying books and adding them to my bookshelves to be read somewhere down the line. I keep buying more even though I probably have enough to last my lifetime. Of course, there's no such thing as too many books. Soooo ... I picked this one off the shelf and pretty much read it non-stop. Nothing is better than a dark, handsome knight and a maiden in distress. Now I'm starting ""In the Shadow of Midnight"" which is Book II in this trilogy, the third being ""The Last Arrow."""
5,I LOVE this book,There is just something magical about this book...I love it. It was my first Canham book many years ago and I have always remembered it. The side characters are so funny and the Black Wolf is one of my top heros ever.He does have that strong male personality typical in romance but he is also human with physical scars and terrible memories. I also really liked Servanne. She was a strong believable heroine. The following books in the series are also really good especially The Last Arrow.
2,pretty boring,"I was so excited by the reviews that I bought this book. It was a let down. The plot is pretty unbelievable (which I could live with in a romance novel), but I really didn't care about the outcome of it at all. The choice to start the book near the end and then go through a mammoth flashback was not inspired. It didn't add anything to the book except make it even more predictable. The sex scenes were also boring - not horribly written, but the characters were not well sketched out, so it was a little difficult to care if they were sleeping together and it was not that interesting from a purely physical point of view."
3,Slow starter not historically accurate.,"Good story line but drawn out and slow start. Not really Robinhood and has her history incorrect, no bedlam at this time and King Richard was never ever gay. For future book references King James wasn't gay either despite revisionist drivel, both were devout Christians and as such believed homosexuality a moral sin. The Hero of the story also has no problem using Servanne as bait and as a result she is beaten and could have been raped but the hero is unmoved, not really keeping in the idea of his being in love. Could have Bergen a much better story"
2,"got really, really, bored 1/2 way through.","Started out okay, but turned into a constant dragged out conversation. I haven't even finished it yet, and I may not. Too many other better books to spend my time on. KInda sorry I paid even $2.00 on this."
1,the lady character is flawed,"i couldn't finish this book.i just did not like the main lady character. she gets maddeningly mad for all kinds of things,i guess to make the relationship more tense, but it does not work. you keep thinkng, here she goes again~!!"
3,some err/lots good,"I write history fiction as an avocation,so I research A Lot. Correct me if Bedlam did not exist as a mental hospital until 1347. And also codpieces were favored in the later middle ages (1500's?). Love the descriptions of castles, towns, people but inaccuracies make me look at this story more as fantasy than historical fiction. Still and all, a pretty good read."
3,intermediate,"This book took a long time to finish as it didn't really keep my attention at all times. Good story line, but very dragged out."
1,Oooey- Gooey !!,"I should have paid more attention to which publication gave this book high praise. Before I was thru the prologue, I was so bogged down in romantic goo and extra adjectives that I couldn't struggle on. Decided the kindest thing I could do for myself was delete it from my Kindle."
2,Nothing New,Stereotypical characters and predictable plot. The villains are so evil they're caricatures. A little too much gore and not enough romance.
2,Tunnel Vision,"This work is very mainstream America: quick, riddled with stereotypical adjectives, mediocre. The author suffers from what I will politely refer to as ""character obsession."" Her favorites are obvious, and they can do no wrong in her eyes. The descriptions are over exaggerated, painful, almost childish in their eroticism. There's nothing satisfying about any of the interactions, and the plot highlights are marred by the author's desire to insert sex throughout. The level of detail is unnecessary and awkward.I'm not sure how this equates to Robin Hood as a mythology. A few cherry-picked names stick out, but this is nothing but erotic fantasy fan-fiction. It doesn't even work as an ""I just want a dumb read"" novel. Very disappointing. Beware of the free aspect.Two stars for being slightly more tolerable than some other works currently out there, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone (even those who revel over smut fiction)."
5,"You Better Know Somebody, When You Come To Iron City","I've been waiting for this DVD to come out since meeting Big Mike last year. I wanted to see what a town in our country would be like without any law and order. I didn't think the people of Iron City would be so receptive to being on camera and speaking with Big Mike, they really seemed to enjoy it.The interview with Monkey was a riot and he seemed to actually tell Iron City's story how it was. What a happy character that guy is. The bonus footage of him was a great plus!Big Mikes sit down with the last police officer of Iron City who told the same story that Monkey did from another perspective but I don't want to give anything away but he kept me on the edge of my seat.The bonus music cd that comes with it is just that, a added bonus with the soundtrack of the the movie.Big Mike and his film crew did a great job putting this documentary together, it was well worth the wait!"
3,Don't believe everything you hear.,"Overall this movie was good, but my family is from Iron City. In fact the former police officer who was interviewed is my former uncle inlaw. I also know alot of good hard working people that live in Iron City now. The place has changed alot from the past that most were speaking of and it's not as scary there as it was made out to be. I just say go to Iron City and see for yourself and don't be afraid. Yes it was a rough place in the past but places change and this one has."
2,'biker' music sort of ok.... but iron city so bad...lol!,"LOL some biker that writes songs? I brought this cause my son moved there last year for a few months.... while the town has it's wackos maybe the author is scared of the redneck/trailer trash mentality ? I live in new jersey ,urban explore abandoned buildings in newark ,paterson,camden... lol let them whimpies go there! you get a cd of songs which a few songs are sort of ok... the rest sort of all the same is it like singin blues or little girly cryin? and the dvd is a comedy of a drunk guy in the woods and an abandoned gas station taken on by two armed and dangerous bikers?lol give me a break! anyway my son and i had a good laugh! maybe i should re-sell it on amazon? then i would have to say it's great? maybe i sould have obama's speech writers do it... lol well i'll never sink that low...."
3,too small and bad wheel design,Cute stroller but a little too small. Fine for a 2 or 3 year old. Front wheels are a bad design as they are difficult to get into the right position for pushing. Very frustrating for a small child.
1,"bad wheels, fell apart",My 2 year old daugher loved this for 2 weeks and then it fell apart. It never assembled perfectly to begin with. One of the wheels was never the right size. It is a choking hazard as the little hub cabs come off very easily on the wheels.So disappointed!!
4,Cute!,"We just got this for my daughter's 5th birthday. It wasn't anything she asked for, but I knew she wanted a new stroller. She LOVES it! I like that you can put the baby in the carrier and push it, or put the baby in the stroller. It also folds up just like the real thing! It's very good for imaginative or open-ended play.I don't know how durable it is since we've only had it for 4 days. One of the wheels doesn't always turn correctly when she pushes it. But once she backs it up, it rights itself. The carrier fits in nicely and it doesn't have to be attached. It just sits in there so a 5 year old can easily take it in and out."
4,Nice design,"The design on this product is great - just like some real strollers it can be transformed to a baby carrier for great imaginary playtime. The only negative comment I can make is that the casters do not work right all the time, but same can be said for real strollers. I think it is still a good buy."
2,Friends,"Well, for quite some time, I had been hoping I would eventually come across this movie. I was curious because I enjoyed some of the songs on the Elton John Soundtrack, and I wanted to see how the music fit the story....Let me just say, I was real impressed that Amazon had it, I had not been able to find it anywhere, and the picture quality, sound quality was great, but.....that cannot save a bad movie, and that is what this was. Everything just happened to quick, it was simply lame, I can't really think of any other way to put it. Yes, I am a guy, but even I can enjoy a truly heartfelt romance, which this was trying to be, but didn't make the grade. Before I saw the movie, I had all of these images in my mind, when I would hear the music, picturing what a great story this could be, I really hope someday I will be able to hear the music again, without it being horribly tainted by this film. Would you believe, after giving this bad review, I still have plans to order the sequel, go figure...."
3,A very memorable film...refreshing by today's standards.,"Old Leonard needs to keep to what he reviews best..Science Fiction and Comedy. This is one movie that is very old fashioned even when it was released in the early 70's. Would be nice to see a world where people really cared for romance and love and the strength of each between 2 persons. But...as they say ""only in the movies"". Don't see it if you find yourself agreeing alot with Maltin."
3,Typical '70s -- sweetly inept.,"Tacky camera techniques are one of the identifying features of '70s cinema and Friends suffers from this. Lewis Gilbert's addiction to zooms can rival even Jess Franco's or Lo Wei's, and his attempts at virtuoso camera movements (even more so in the sequel, Paul and Michelle) hurt this sensitive, small study of a teenaged couple's sexual awakening and romantic journey. Anicee Alvina and Sean Bury play their roles well and if the script hadn't been so lacklustre could have made Friends a minor classic. Instead it is just a dubious entry in the books, unjustly blasted by critics, but also intrinsically flawed."
1,Nice Try,"Thank goodness that Rand departs from Aristotle on a number of points. The author has it just backwards: it is Aristotle's errors that gave rise to ""corrosive skepticism"" and ethical subjectivism. In arguing that there are values outside of the context of life, the author has also departed from what may be the implicit and overriding idea behind Aristotle's own thought. There still can be no values outside of that context and these arguments only confirm Rand's thesis."
1,Not for the iPod touch,"This is not for the iPod Touch. It works but only as a very large number (1,000) of audio tracks with titles like ""What's wrong sir?""An iPod touch version with search capability would be a good product but this is not it."
3,lots of movies for the money...,"Most of the film noir in this package were pretty good. The actors were good, the plots were good, and the production was ok. Since the movies that are produced today are in the F class, the movies in this package were in the A class!"
3,OEM Fit and Performance without Protective Coating,"This rotor was a direct replacement for my stock rear rotors on my BMW 2005 325iT. It installed like OE, no problems or issues. It is made by Centric, a respected manufacturer owned by Stop Tech, a respected manufacturer of high performance after market brakes.There was nothing fancy about this rotor like slots, holes, or anything else to compromise the integrity of the rotor blank; just beefy iron. However, it also didn't have a protective coating on the hub face, so I expect it to rust eventually. Rusting won't affect usage, performance, or life, but it looks like crud. The online description of the rotor didn't say anything about protective coatings, but I assumed it had it because OE does. I would have given this rotor five stars if it had a protective coating."
5,Sally's pan,"My husband bought this pan for me as a Christmas gift. I absolutely love it. It is just the right size. Not too big for the two of us but big enough to use when we have company. I also like the high sides, you don't have to worry about food falling out. I have had a number of friends see the pan and wish they had one. Sally Hawk"
4,Usefull!!,"A very usefull pan that takes advantage of the expanded burners of the newer stove tops. The guage of the aluminum could be a little heavier....Other than that, I enjoy the pan."
4,RR Oval Pan,This is a great non stick pan that is great for anything requiring a large skillet type pan. The only down fall is the shape is not conducive to the tradition round burner and often does not cook items evenly.
5,this is a must for family cooking,"I recently ordered this 5 quart Rachael Ray pan, nothing sticks to it, heats all areas evenly, great for bacon on Sunday morning, to big family dinners. Clean up is easy, heating pads not needed to maneuver it around. I love to cook, and this pan makes it even better, its an investment i would do all over again. As for the packaging and shipping, that was done very well too, i think i received it 3 or 4 days from the orginal order, very pleased all the way around."
5,Excellent purchase!,Bought this pan for my mom as a Mother's Day gift. She absolutely loves it! I just may have to purchase one for myself!
5,Awesome!,"I love love love this pan! I've been watching Rachel Ray cook with it for some time, never realizing that I could purchase it. Since receiving it, I've used it just about every day. I love the depth of this pan, it cleans up like a dream and cooks evenly, even with its odd shape. Highly recommended!"
4,Practical AND Unpractical,"This pan is great for making a large skillet meal and even for boiling or roasting things on top of the stove. I do, however, find it hard to store because of its length and it doesn't quite fit on any burner on my stove. It has plenty of uses, but it's the non-cooking aspects that are unpractical. Also, just like the full set of RR Hard Anodized pots and pans, it has bolts on the interior of the pan where the handles are. Food likes to get up in there and stick. Nothing that can't be handled, but you need to put attention into cleaning that area."
5,cook away,"I just love Rachel Rays pots and pans. nothing sticks to them. They wash up nicely. Wish I had these years ago. bought my daughter a set for her wedding shower. I wish they could go in dishwasher though, but they are easy to wash. clean up nice."
5,Excellent!!,All I can say is that this pan is Excellent! I bought it for my mom and she uses it for everything! She raves about it.
5,Oval is terrific!,"What a great pan!! I use it more than any one of the other pots or pans from the whole collection I bought. It holds a ton of vegetables at one time, and with the cover, becomes a steamer, too. Clean up is a breeze, and handling is easy with the helper grip handle. Love, Love, Love it!!!"
5,excellent product,"I have used this unusually shaped oval Rachel Ray pot about 4 times and each time I am so happy with the results. It fits perfectly over two burners, it cooks evenly; it holds a large quantity of food so it is perfect for stews and braising. I recommend it highly. It is well worth the price. It seems to me that it is an answer to stovetops that only have one large burner because it fits so well on two small burners with the same and perhaps better results than using just the large burner. Every cook should have at least one of these pots."
2,filled a nitch,this pot is very usefull but i burnt the handle the first time i used on the stover. ray will fix or replace if mail it back
5,A Chef's Favorite,"I purchased this pan for my daughter when she graduated from Culinary School, and she now claims it is her very favorite pan. The size and shape is so versatile, and the see through lid is excellent. She uses it almost daily. She loves it so much, she REFUSES to let her boyfriend cook with it! (always use non metal utensils)"
4,second one is a charm,"Ordered this and when it arrived the lid was somehow warped and would not fit solidly onto the pan. Emailed amazon and they immediately sent out a replacement at no cost to me. got the second one and the lid fits as it should. Still haven't cooked with it yet but already I can see that I will like the oblong shape of the pan on the stove top because it will let me use all four burners simultaneously if needed, without crowding out other pans."
5,Love it!,Rachael Ray 5-Quart Hard Anodized Orange Oval Saut¿ Pan with Helper HandleI love this pan! It makes cooking a real joy. Easy clean up. A must have! Enjoy!
1,B.S.,"The description alone tells you enough about the credibility. ""Independent Greek"" island. How can one be independent and Greek, it is one or the other. The inhabitants can speak Greek and have ancestry from Greece but the island as a nation is either independent or not."
4,A little rough,"The cover was a little more detached than I expected, but still a good read -- kind of a weird book, but fine for anyone who can think."
3,Allot like SOYLENT GREEN,"This story is like SOYLENT GREEN in many ways. A remake of Soylent green is not really appropriate, so what needs to be done is to show SOYLENT GREEN in theatres again and make NATURES END into a movie, so people can be hopefully shocked into action."
1,Load of tripe,"Absolute absurdity. I read this book back in 1989 and followed the ""news headlines"" to compare them to actual headlines. Not even close. The air and water are cleaner and technology is making lives better."
4,A More Coherent Story Than Warday. Good Science Fiction,"The writing team that brought you the classic Post Nuclear psuedo-autobiography Warday, team up again to tackle another potential disaster, this time it's pollution gone wild. In this ecological disater tale, Strieber and Kunetka use some of the devices they used during Warday, particularly Government Reports, Newspaper Articles and witness interviews to give the feeling your reading a true story. Yet, unlike Warday, this not a ""fake documentary"" but a good, action filled story with so very well drawn characters. I'm not sure of the science behind the whole situation that the writers use, or whether this cautionary tale is even remotely likely, biut as a story, it works. Here they uses some classic science fiction themes reminiscent of Phillip K. Dick, and they do it well."
3,Pleasant.,"Excuse Me Miss, Run It, Say Goodbye, Poppin' and Ain't No Way (You Won't Love Me) are the standouts.Thank You and Run It (Remix) are stupid crappy songs and should have stopped filling the disc with pointless drivel.Anyway, this CD is decent fun. It is primarily Hip-Hop and R&B-fused; production and there are some ballads present.Chris is a decent singer but now he needs to start writing some of his hits. He will be big in the future though. Just wait and see!So Glad is a bonus track.3.5 stars."
5,A Joy to Read,I've never been to Bhutan and have no plans to go. A friend handed me the book as I left on a vacation. I could not put it down. It's beautifully written. Read it even if you're not about to leave for the Peace Corps.
5,"thought provoking, touching","In reading Zeppa's physical and spiritual adventure, one's own life can be seen in fresh perspective, diffidence shaken, other worlds hinted at."
1,Great Start but typical Ethnocentric white person,"While I enjoyed the beginning of the book, the middle and ending were tedious. I loved the exploration of culture and all that is Bhutan until Mz. Zeppa forsakes her school and travels to the university. I thought it rude to desert what she started out and learned to love (the remote village). When she gets to the university, fights with coworkers, tries to change the Bhutanese women, I felt badly for all that is western culture. I am tired of people going to the east and trying to impose their culture, social morays, and precepts. I truly feel sorry for the child that is split between cultures and lacking a true essential - father - in life. Please do not buy this book and further subsidize White Ethnocentrism."
3,I was there,"I read this book as I traveled for three weeks in Bhutan. I don't think I would have gotten nearly as much out of it if I had never seen the country for myself. While the author does give some description to the countryside, you can never quite visualize the real thing. I find her description of the people, lifestyle, the way they dress, the peace within the people of the countryside was inadequate.She also never admits to her naivete and lack of respect for situations within another culture.It is an interesting read, but made better only because I was there..."
5,Wonderful story of a wonderful place,"Having just returned from one year in Bhutan, I felt the need to comment on a book that I read before I went there. Jamie does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of Bhutan. Since I was going there as a volunteer, I found that the book was great preparation for my journey. I heard that the King of Bhutan has read the book and found that it helped him understand the role of volunteers in his country. But I also found that it is a very human and honest story. Some people may not like the level of personal honesty that is in the story, but it makes it really come alive to me. I think that any story told with this level of honesty will seem to some degree self-centered.But the story is really about Bhutan and Bhutan shines here. She truly shows the complexity of the political situation and the gentleness of the people. Bhutan is really one of the most magical places in the world. We need more stories like this one."
5,One point about Jamie Zeppa's stay in Bhutan,Just a response to some of the reviews of this book....Jamie Zeppa did not live in Bhutan for three years. She lived there for about ten years. Her experience as recounted in the book is a lot deeper and richer than a short stay would provide. A great read.
4,Honestly written,"After reading ""Beyond the Sky and Earth"" I felt I had a better understanding of Bhutan as a western traveler would see it. Criticism has been made about Jamie Zappa's morals and actions in Bhutan but I was happy she was honest about her conflicts with the culture. We all wish to be politically correct travelers in a foriegn land but when living in a culture for three years and seeing injustices, staying out of it has got to be difficult.I began reading this book thinking Jamie Zappa was not going to make it on her journey to Bhutan but was pleasantly suprised to see her work through her own mistakes and issues and give her reader an real account of life in Bhutan. Jamie Zappa does not claim to be perfect or make all the right choices and I think we learn more about ourselves and Bhutan because of it."
1,to me it was too superficial,"As i sad before, the whole story was superficial and the writer was kind of naive, I missed some deeper info about Bhutanese culture"
5,very interesting perspective,"Very few books get written on Bhutan. Very few westerners get to live in Bhutan. The ones that come as reporters come with their own baggage and perception of what Bhutan is. Very few people are balanced when it comes to reporting and writing about Bhutan and her people. Some people abuse the special karmic connection which brings them to Bhutan and her people, up close and personal. Bhutan is no doubt a special place on earth. It is therefore not a surprise that the writer of this book faced some hardball problems when putting her thoughts together. But Zeppa's love for the people and country comes shining in the pages of the book. That is the testimony of the author's sincerity to the people who opened the doors of their houses. Thank God, there are people who appreciate the kindness and the generosity of the Bhutanese."
5,amazing!!!,this book was absolutely amazing from start to finish. i was so fascinated and excited by what she would write next... i looked forward to every page and slowed down towards the end because i never wanted it to end! anyone who didnt like this book is insane!!!
5,Excellent journal of a young womans life changed in Bhutan,"This book is for anyone who is fascinated with the East, has perpetual wanderlust, or has ever thought deeply about their life and their place in the world. It's a great book written by a smart young woman who volunteers to teach children in the middle of nowhere and quickly (and sometimes painfully) learns how to ""manage"" on her own with no prior worldly experience. She ends up finding herself, an appreciation of simple things, and a new man. The book is full of great imagery of Bhutan, the villages, the people, the ""vomit comit,"" and the spirituality that surrounds it all."
1,Better luck next time,"I'm afraid I have to agree with those who found this book disappointing. I've long had a fascination with the country of Bhutan, but this book seems to have little to do with it. It comes across more like a whiny memoir from a privileged westerner more interested in complaining about her problems (many of them brought on herself) rather than giving anyone real insights into Bhutanese society, culture or history. Like others, I found myself amazed at the rather caviler attitude Zeppa displays in the book about many of her decidedly unprofessional actions.Despite my assessment of this book, I actually would be interested in reading another from the same author -- perhaps one written on the same subject when she has grown up some."
5,What a Fabulous Journey!,"This book is a terrific journey that is not only rich in detail, but in reality. Being a young girl from a Northern town, I found I could see myself being shocked by the differences in this simplistic, uncomplicated country. The way that Zeppa wrote this book it is both a love story with the country and a coming of age. Readers watch her grow into a more solid self sure woman as she finds her place in this wonderfully magic land. It was such a joy to read, it's easy to see that Zeppa enjoyed writing it."
3,Interesting,"The book kept me interested throughout, although I found it lacking in depth. Jamie arrives in Bhutan, and after the culture shock, she falls in love with the country. I am interested in the subject matter already, so I was eager to hear more. But I found myself often disappointed by the superficial nature of the descriptions. The country appears to be a very special place, and the book is a pleasant way to get somewhat familiar with Bhutan. But just somewhat....Pleasant, nice, ok."
