4,Quarter holder,It was a nice product. The only thing that I didn't like was that it was difficult to insert the quarters.
3,Slightly out of date,"I should have read the product description better. I bought this thinking it was a map-version so that I could teach my six year old son about the states, but this was just a book with the holes for the quarters. Also it goes up to 2009, and apparently they are minting new quarters now because I have some 2012 Hawaii Quarters."
2,Sliced Up,"I am still using the Statehood Quarters book as I didn't want to fuss with a return, but the folder was sliced through down the side. Looks like the exacto knife sliced it at some point in time. A large slice - 3 inches that goes through the binding. I like the folder though."
3,"not colorful, but the slots are okay","It is not colorful. Also, it doesn't include the map. However, I think the slots are big because the quarters are fit into the slots."
4,great,"This folder works great and is very pretty, but most importantly, its easy toget the quarters into it. I am very happy with this coin folder."
1,digital headphone radio,"Was ordered but had to be cancelled because it was NOT digital. How can a product be described as digital, you place the order, and then are told it is an analog radio and NOT as advertised?"
5,Last Dinner on the Titanic,"This is a delightful book and a recommended read for anyone who is a Titanic fan or interested in the history and the food. I love the books presentation. The fact that you can re-create any of the three levels ie 1st glass down to general is a hoot that harks back to a time of fine dining and almost apartheid snobbery. You can host your own dinner party and the book explains in fine detail how to achieve this. I only need to buy the CD of the music now and I am set for my ""Titanic Dinner""The Last Dance: Music for a Vanishing Era (The Music Heard on the Fateful Voyage of the Titanic)."
5,RMS Titanic historical books.,This book gives the reader a virtual feast of the elegance and class that was a product of a transatlantic voyage in 1912. Not just first class but for second and steerage the ship was a engineering marvel and the food and amenities were the focal point of the crossing. The Edwardian era prior to World War One was a time of rapid technological change and great gastronomy. Ships were becoming floating hotels and fine dining experiences the likes of which will never be seen again. The Last Dinner on the Titanic is a must for maritime history buffs.
5,great for titanic dinner parties,"excellent recipes for those willing to take the time.I cooked 5 of the first class entries all of which were very good,especially the beef barley soup.The third class pork roast also sounds like it has the ingredients to be something special.great book , great cook book.it really adds something when you have the dinner and watch the movie."
5,This book was useful and interesting.,"I have been studing the TITANIC since the second grade. I found the this book useful and interesting, in the way of preparing period food.I owe the great success of my re-creation dinner for fifteen people. This book helped me ,and my friends, to revise and shorten the menu, from the original 11 course menu shown in the book! All the period etiquette, table settings, and dress pointers and tips were great in re-creating the period feel of the Last Dinner on the TITANIC. Out of all my books in my TITANIC collection, this one is one of my favorites."
5,The End of an Era,"I bought this book for my chef husband the same year that both the film and the musical about Titanic debuted. It wasn't until last night (April 14, 2012), however, that he decided to actually replicate one of the menus in commemoration of the 100th anniversary. Although we opted for four courses instead of eleven, every bite was delicious and harkened back to an elegant era in which fine dining not only meant lingering over a meal (rather than inhaling it on one's way out the door) but also observing the rules of etiquette (something which very few parents seem to be teaching anymore). In addition to recipes, the book is replete with vintage photographs, stories about the passengers and crew on this ill-fated voyage, and even tips on how to orchestrate your own Edwardian dinner party."
4,Awesome Cream of Barley Soup,"My daughter and I have staged a Last Dinner on the Titanic for over ten years. We used to cook exclusively dishes from this cookbook, but then that got old after awhile, even though there is a lot of variety and the recipes are mostly very good, and you can pick the level of snootiness of your menu (1st, 2nd and 3rd class menus and recipes are all included). But, year after year I have made the Cream of Barley Soup recipe, it is amazingly delicious. The book is also full of factoids, menus and suggestions for throwing a full-blown Titanic party. Highly recommended for the Titanic/Edwardian era enthusiasts among us!"
5,One of the most amazing books ever,Buy this and you won't be disappointed. This is a chance to relive history through a beautiful book of recipes. I'm very happy I purchased this item!
3,Double X at ATL,"Indeed, this short live concert video is an excerpt of a rarely seen film of the Atlanta Pop Festival featuring Jimi Hendrix, Santana, The Greatful Dead and many others.Unfortunately, the video also does not include any of the said performers except Hendrix. Hendrix does play a full set and while the performance is great as is the film quality, it is the audio that suffers a bit since this is after all a ""BOOTLEG"" recording take from a broadcast on Japanese TV some time ago. Don't be mislead by my mention of the audio. The quality is really great and one can hear many rare songs performed by Hendrix at the time as well as hear and see bassist Billy Cox complement Jimi's guitar rocketing with his own bass bomb droppings. It's a trully double X performance in ATL!I would also add that one purchase this DVD for the actual price of $19.99 and not anything higher than this."
1,Este es el peor disco CD de Alvarez Guedes...ni una risa.,"Soy dueno de 9 discos de Alvarez Guedes, incluyendo Nos. 1-5, 6, 8, 21 y ahora el No.32 CD.Sin duda, este Volume No. 32 es el mas malo de su carrera. Ni si quiera se rie el publico en la grabacion de este disco. Mis padres oyeron este disco y hubieron muy pocos risas.Los primeros discos son los mejores de Alvarez Guedes. Parece que los ultimos discos, Alvarez se le acabo los cuentos comicos. Se le acabo la inspiracion. Que pena me da."
3,"great sound, the lyrics kill it though","Cool hand luke has a great indie sound, but I can't get past the lyrics. His voice is a little whiney but not too bad at all, and easy to get used to. They're like creed but actually sound good. I'm dissapointed to hear such musical talent in a band when i can't enjoy the lyrics. Its just a bit too hard to enjoy this music when listening carefully and hearing the words hallejah, praise, and christ all over the place. So I guess this album isn't for the athiest, but if I was a good christian, I would definately get this."
4,great book,being only ten and just starting to read huge chapter books I thought this would make base on for where I was. it turned out okay except for a few mistakes here and there.
2,really?!!??,"I didn't finish the book. It may be okay for a child's imagination but I found it overly simple and and almost demeaning for an adult reader. If you are a serious reader, I wouldn't bother."
5,"Very entertaining, for both kids and adults","Anyone who has been adopted by a stray cat can relate to Mr. Foster as he tries to deal with a feline determined not to be a stray anymore. Slowly but surely, the cat imbeds himself in the hotel, and before you know, it's 7 years later and the cat has become a hotel institution. The cat's self-assuredness reminds me of many our own pets, past and present. It is always what has made cats so fascinating, and that characteristic is captured perfectly here.The story is well-constructed & well-paced, and the illustrations are a lot of fun. The fight between the cat & the raccoon is classic, and not to be missed. Even if you don't have kids, you may very well find yourself enjoying this."
1,Frankly disappointing,"Ms. Graves may be touted as an up-and-coming young voice, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Her interpretation of what should be sweet and simple music is hugely melodramatic, and her vibrato is so thick I honestly can't tell if her voice is any good or not. If you like that sort of thing (and some folks do), then it is probably a five-star CD. Myself, I can't stand to listen to O Holy Night -- my favorite carol, and one that should sound pure, reverent, and angelic -- sung with a voice more appropriate to Wagner."
4,Refreshing - Just Guitar!,"The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because there were a couple remakes of old songs I never liked to begin with - but, that's just me. With that exception, I'll say BUY IT. This CD is refreshing because it's just fabulous guitar music. No lyrics to spoil the pureness of exquisite picking. Johnny A. transitions from blues to jazz to country (even some slide in there) flawlessly. Here's a CD you'll listen to over and over and hum the tunes when you're not listening to it."
5,Brilliant,"I bought this for Two-Wheeled Horse. It is absolutely fantastic, but the rest of the album is also up to that standard."
5,Eclectic Guitar Playing,"If you like Greg Koch, Danny Gatton, Jimi Hendrix, Bill Hullett, SRV, EJ, Ventures, Wes Montgomery, Will Ray and the Hellecasters etc. you are going to like this CD. I refuse to compare this with anyone else. This is great guitar music and I applaud the elements of the music industry that allow this kind of music to be distributed.And his version of You Don't Love Me is funnnnnnky!"
5,"Awesome, tasty, guitar driven music!","If you are a lover of GREAT guitar albums...then get Johnny A. 'Sometime Tuesday Morning' NOW! Filled with beautiful melodies, fantastic playing, and a few stellar cover tunes (Beatles, Jimmy Webb, Ventures, etc.) this CD is a must have! There are no clunkers on this one folks! Pure, clean guitar sounds that will cause you to listen to it over and over again! I can't seem to pull this one out of the player! Johnny A. is a master and in a perfect world would be heard by millions. Nuff said."
1,This guy is awesome!,"This CD is worth it just for the song ""Yes it is"" (an instrumental cover of a great Beatles' song). It took me about 3 listens to realize that most of Johnny A's songs only feature a guitar, bass, and drums yet they sound so complex. There's nobody else like him."
4,Saw Johnny A. live in Boston and this isn't it.,"Saw Johnny A. in Boston at the House of Blues (never heard of him) and his trio blew me away. Drums and bass were right on and the sound man had it perfect. All instrumental until the end of first set when Peter Wolf was invited on (who was nothing but great to see and hear). Then Johnny's fine looking wife came on to help with vocals. I bought the CD right there. The CD doesn't capture the live performance however. Sorry Johnny, but how about a live CD next?"
5,A wonderful lesson in family history.,"Kudos to Albert Stagg!! I always remember this book sitting on my grandmother's shelf as a child, but it wasn't until I was older that I took a serious interest in my family's history. I am so thankful to Mr. Stagg for giving the Almada's this gift. I have bought several copies for family members, which has become a popular Christmas gift. It is always a special thing to know one's roots and heritage and with this book I can read about mine whenever I feel. Thank You!"
3,wrangler,not the same loose straight jeans i get from the east coast dont even know if there real wranglers and there relaxed fit not loose labels are all right but jeans look like knock offs
2,Great Jeans Flawed,"The feel and fit of these jeans are just fine, however I have had 3 of the belt loops pull out of the jean material, with less than 2 months of wear. I sewed the first one back on but noticed after a few more washes that 2 more were pulling out. the part where the belt loops are attached at the bottom is not reinforced, causing this issue in my case. I would keep these jeans based on the material, but without the loops they are useless to me."
2,Cheap denim,"These jeans fit well and look great, but I noticed when I first received them that they didn't seem to be made from the usual durable denim that Wrangler uses -- it was thinner and softer. It made for a very comfortable fit, but within 2 weeks (several wears), I had caught the belt loop on something and tore out a chunk of fabric as the belt loop became dislodged. The stitching was much stronger than the denim. I've had a number of pairs of Wrangler jeans for many years and never had the denim tear out like that before. So if you're easy on your jeans and want a great, comfortable fit, then these are good. But if you want that and the typical durability of denim, then I recommend looking at other styles... other Wranglers, even. Just not this version."
4,Very comfortable jeans,"I'm a tall, thin man, and it's extremely difficult to find jeans that fit well. These are, without a doubt, the best-fitting and most comfortable jeans I've ever owned. The only con is that, while the thin denim is very comfortable, it's also very prone to wear out or fray quickly. For some reason, these jeans are hard to find, but they're worth every penny."
2,It's a shame for a brand with a worldwide reputation.,"It's a shame for a brand with a worldwide reputation. They sent me jeans, without a button on the right pocket. ........."
4,Excellent quality and fit,I liek the quality of Wranglers and their offerings in several cuts/designs. My new jeans is is not heavy and fit is perfect.
2,"Good jeans, not very ""loose""","Jeans were in great condition, fast shipping, nice color wash. However, we purchased them for my husband because of the ""Loose Fit"". Fit him really well in the waist, but the legs were still on the tight side and not loose at all. So we had to return them. We were hoping they were similar to the Wrangler's Loose Fit style we used to buy (not made anymore) but they weren't close."
4,Right fit for the right price,Well made jeans. Length and fit just right. Hey did I mention they look and feel good. I look forward to buying my next pair.
5,Didn't Have to Go Up 2 Sizes to Fit!!,"I've actually bought 6 pair of these and for the first time I could buy jeans in close to my actual size that fit. I usually have to go up 2 sizes to accommodate my thighs without having to go super baggy. The jeans pictured are actually the relaxed fit though, these jeans are actually baggier than the jeans pictured. If you don't like a baggier fit I recommend the relaxed fit. They fit and feel great and the price is excellent, previous jeans I bought were $50 + and I still had to have them tailored. I will continue to buy these and highly recommend them"
2,A little to tight,"They are supposed to have room, but they seem extremely tight and crowd the sacred area."
5,Great Read,"I absolutely LOVED this book, by the author who wrote ""The Thornbirds"" (another great one). I am not even a big fan of straight out romance novels, but this story really touched me in its innocence and sweetness.I caught the movie version of Tim on TV, back in my teens and have always wanted to read the novel. I was not disappointed. The book blows the movie way out of the water--but it definately didn't hurt that I had a young and gorgeous Mel Gibson in tight shorts to visualize while I was reading. ^_^The only thing that threw me was the ending, which I found a bit abrupt and inconclusive, but perhaps the author ended it in that fashion to make a point that Mary's life with Tim was bound to be a bumpy ride in the furture."
4,Remarkable,Colleen Mccullough is a very fine author and I find the characters realistic because is totally believable. There are so many people who don't believe in love. It is refreshing to read a book that was written so long ago that love is the only feeling one should be concerned with. Everyones opinions on how this or that should be is tossed out the window.I love the authors courage to go outside the box.
3,Movie better than the book,"This is the first book I have read that was made into a movie where I thought the movie was better than the book. Some things in the book that the movie left out were unbelievable. Mary had worked her way up from an office worker to secretary for the company president. She was asked to spend a month out in the outback of Australia. This would never happen. She spent a month in a recuperating hospital after being ""fixed"" so she couldn't get pregnant immediately after her marriage to Tim? This is a day in the hospital at best. The knife incident with Tim at the end of the book, just so the nurses would think Mary was Tim's mother. It's a good book, but if you have seen the movie with a young Mel Gibson and Piper Laurie I think you will be disappointed with it, I was."
2,Am I the only one who hated it?,"While the idea itself is good, and it reminds me of what could have been before the movie ""I Am Sam"" took place, I thought the story was quite poorly written. It read more like a how-to guide for dealing with developmentally delayed people, using lots of ""personal anecdotes"" and hypothetical stories."
5,A beautiful love story!!,"If you love the book DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE!!!! If you have seen the movie, read the book. This story goes where romance novels have never been before, and comes out shining. The charcaters are loveable - especially Tim - though the 'incident' in the first chapter or so is recommended to be skipped over. Wonderfully written and beautifully unpredictable. This book will never grow old in a romantics heart."
5,kick a$$ old school metal!,i remember when i was 16 and learning to rip up on the guitar---i heard this album and flipped--years later i've aquired the japanese version (from ebay)and still have it tucked away--from time to time i jam it-- it still owns!
4,Solid heavy metal w/ cool riffs,"It is Worth picking up a copy of this 80's hard rock/metal band. 2nd tier metal , but solid."
4,Great 80s Metal!,"With its twin lead guitar attack, thundering rhythm section and a lead singer who was a spot-on dead ringer for Rob Halford, Malice came on like gangbusters, highly reminiscent of ""Screaming For Vengeance""-era Judas Priest. This second album is easily just as good as the first one, ""...In The Beginning."" Tunes like ""Sinister Double,"" ""Chain Gang Woman"" and the Stephen King-inspired ""Christine"" rock with an unbridled fury that puts to shame many of the so-called ""nu-metal"" bands crowding the market today. If you're a fan of solid old-school metal with killer riffs and malicious (pardon the pun on words) melodies, this is definitely up your alley!"
5,Old school metal,This is a must have for fans of 80's metal. This album was their best effort. Its heavy and has some good vocals.
4,Good CD from a Great Band,"This CD is different from the other Fu CD's and I'm a little dissapointed that they did not continue in the direction they were going with King of the Road. It seemed like King of the Road redefined Fu like you might say Revolver redefined the Beatles but the songs on California Crossing seem to be hatched out of a Fu textbook for songwriting (which is still pretty damn good, don't get me wrong). Overall this is still an excellent CD which I will undoubtably listen to countless times however it makes me realize how great King of the Road was in its creativity. If this is your first Fu purchase and you dig it then you must also get their ealier stuff like In Search Of and Daredevil (personal favorite) hec just get them all, they all rock !!!!!!"
2,Not as heavy or good as previous stuff,"I've listened to the CD all the way through a few times now, and I must say I'm somewhat disapointed. Absent are the heavy, crunching, catchy as hell riffs we've all come to love and enjoy. They've been replaced by boring, run of the mill songs that are a far cry from anything on ""The Action is Go"" or ""King of the Road"".Still, a few hi-lites are ""Squash that Fly"" and the instrumental ""Wasteoid"". Old skool Fu fans may be put off, if you're new to Fu, I suggest starting with ""Action"" as your first Fu experience.LISTEN TO BLACK SABBATH!"
3,Not their best effort,"As a long-time fan of Fu Manchu, I gotta say this record missed the target for me. While I still respect the band for proudly flying the stoner rock flag, this record is more of a polished MTV friendly anthem than a sluge-ladden masterpiece of old. Don't get me wrong...I'm all for a band's musical development if it goes somewhere good (like Clutch or Sonic Youth). But this record goes somewhere I don't want to be. There are a few good songs here (""Mongoose"" being one of their all-time greats), but it is the first Chu album I ever bought where I find myself skipping through the mediocre songs to get to the gems. Their earlier records weren't this way at all. ""No One Rides for Free"", ""Daredevil"", ""Action is Go"", and even the under-rated ""King of the Road"" were fantastic. These albums all shined from start to finish without exception. If you want their best, buy ""In Search Of""."
2,"Goodbye Fu, hello Def Leppard","If you are a fuzz-aholic and enjoy ""In Search Of.."", ""Eatin' Dust"" and ""Action"" etc. then you may be disappointed with the Fu's latest release. The songs are catchy radio rock songs and overall pretty decent. However they lack the all - out jam of Eatin Dust and the great guitar tone of all the other Fu discs. The Fu are obviously thinking radio here."
4,Fu Manchu - 'California Crossing' (Mammoth),"Worthy follow-up to 2000's 'King Of The Road' disc.Fu Manchu has apparently road-tested their heavy guitar riffing.Sort of reminds me of early AC/DC,which is a good thing.'California...' appears to be maybe more melodic,that might be because the CD was produced by Matt Hyde(Porno For Pyros,Monster Magnet).Tunes that I liked best are ""Mongoose"",""Whiz Kid"",""Squash That Fly"" and the skateboard friendly ""Downtown To Dogtown"".'California Crossing' and the band's efforts here after just COULD land them to a wider audience.Let's hope so."
1,The editorial review is completely right.,"I was disgusted by the poor scholarship in this book. White quotes at will from primary documents and fellow historians without a single citation to show where he got his information. White is also guilty of broad overgeneralizations that are poorly supported. For example, the section on Victorian America includes a paragraph that claims that ""a healthy society could not survive without the control of instincts"" (p 4). White then quotes from an Irish ""orator and parliamentarian, Edmund Burke."" No Amerian sources are cited, leaving the reader to assume that what is true in Ireland at that time must also be true in America -- a blurred and unprofessional perspective. This book wasted my time."
4,"Original Lp had different ""Doncha' Think It's Time""","If you listen to the end of Doncha' Think It's Time, you may notice Elvis sings it differently than on the original Lp version of this collection. That's because on the original Lp, they mistakenly put Take 40 on it instead of the hit single version, which is what you have here. The hit version was a splice of Takes 40, 47 and 48. You can find both versions on Essential Elvis Vol. 3 - Hits Like Never Before."
3,could be better,"It's a great album even the transfer of the master tape is good, the only problem is 2 songs.One of them is A big hunk o' love, big mistake from BMG they add the alternate take 4 instead of the original version.Listen carefully to the piano part where Elvis does'nt sing (the piano version is not the same)The second song is Doncha' think it's time, the ending is not the same as the original, splice take 40 was added at the end of the song.And if i'm not mistaken the recording is mono like the first cd release in 1988.So i'm a little disapointed of this release and also they could of added the rca logo at the far right like the vinyl record, you know it looks more original."
3,Never Enuff,"Good first album. Bought this back when it was released off the strength of Fly High Michelle, which still sounds awesome. New Thing is okay, as is Hot Little Summer Girl. Little Indian Angel is a good track as well. They were just warming up with this debut, and their efforts that followed just got better and more personal."
4,"good, but not their best","I like this disc, but their record called ""Strength"" is the best. More than half the songs are classic, like ""Goodbye"" and ""Hollywood Ya""- great almost Elvis Costello-ish Beatlepop.Find ""Strength""!"
1,Enough really is enough,"This album is a joke, much like the band. I still remember laughing at their videos on MTV and I was only ten years old at the time. Please, take the money for this CD and give it to the poor or something."
5,Easy Opening,"I like it. I want the traditonal open the inner can top, type of opener. I work with my hands and now need some type of help with opening things. This fits the bill and it is green!"
4,great soundtrack,"this is one of the best soundtracks, especially for when this film came out. it has a dark, gritty feel that many movies try to capture, but don't... I've been looking for this soundtrack for years, but it's been out of issue for as long as I can remember."
2,Sadie talks too much!!!,"Unfortunately, I tried to like this DVD, but it is hard simply because Sadie just talk too much. She guides you into a pose but does not allow you time to experience the sensations of your body because she just keeps chatting away. The contradictory thing is that she uses all the ""yoga"" language but this does not feel like yoga, but rather like a workout. The routine itself is fantastic if your goal is to lose weight, and I guess her intentions are good with all that chatting, but maybe in her next DVD, she could add another option with less instructions for those who want more than a workout. That is, for those seasoned practitioners who just want to go deeper and connect with their body and mind during their yoga session."
4,DVD for extreme core strength,"Think of this DVD as a series of yoga based exercises, designed to develop extreme core strength; with a focus on the belly. Consider this DVD to supplement a more balanced vinyasa program.For someone in search of peace and relaxation, strength and flexibility, and a youthful feeling body; I would recommend this DVD in addition to INSIGHT YOGA with Sarah Powers. Both Sarah and Sadie have a physical strength based on grace, flexibility and balance.Beginners may be advised to start with The Original TOTAL YOGA with Tracey Rich."
4,great work-out,"I got this product, because it was recommended to me by a friend. The first time I did the yoga from this DVD, it was VERY hard (I have taken yoga at the YMCA before), but once getting used to the trainer, i felt more at ease with it. I would not recommend this DVD to beginners, but rather intermediaries."
1,Linkin Park-Reanimation,"This CD is a big disapointment to me. This is a bunch of remixed songs from there first cd, that sound terrible! I love the songs the way they were, this makes them sound terrible! The only good song I was waiting for ""My December"" they made sound worse than the DVD. If you are looking for new LInkin Park, this is not it!I played the first one 100 times, and I will not play this one again!!Do not waste your money!"
3,Linkin Park? No...,"One value I really liked about Linkin Park was that they didn't have profanity in their songs... Anyway, this CD doesn't have much tunes in it, it's concentrating on the words, and it's like rap. I don't like rap too much, so I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Clever but not clever enough.,"Reanimation by Linkin Park is a remix album from the songs of Hybird Theory. The best remix is My December, that song sounds better than the original which is hard to achieve. Chester Bennington has some powerful chops, how does he not lose his voice every day? Points of Authority remix is pretty good and In the End but I wasn't all that impressed with all glossy riffs. Stick to Hybrid Theory instead."
4,"Good cd, but...","There are several excellent remixes on this city. Pts of Athry and KRWLNG are just awesome. The rest of the songs are ok, but there are a few that are just not quite as good as the orignals."
3,Not as good as the original,"I'm obsessed with Linkin Park. I bought this album for the soul reason that it's by LP.This album has more of a rap/hip-hop feel than Hybrid Theory. I don't generally like that type of music, but this is an exception. And it still sounds somewhat like rock music. One thing that I dislike about Reanimation, is that most songs feature other artists; I prefer when the vocals are simply Mike and Chester. Speaking of Mike and Chester, they are both really great on this album, along with the rest of the band. So basically, I'm neutral about this album.The best tracks (in my opinion) are Frgt/10, Wth>You, My>Dsmbr, By_Myslf, Kyur4 th Ich, and Rnw@y. Heh. I'm not good with favorites.I would reccomend this album to Linkin Park fans, and rap/hip hop fans. But if you're not into those mentioned just now, I wouldn't buy it if I were you."
4,Not quite a four...make it a 3.7,"First I've got to say, this is not as good as Hybrid Theory. I do like a couple better (Pts. Of. Athrty with the new opening, and KRWLNG) but the others just can't compare to the originals. The titles like Riff Raff, Stef, Chali and a few others are just a bunch of phone calls and dumb stuff, but thank God they're only about 10 seconds long. It is a nice change once in a while after you've listened to Hybrid Theory a bunch of times. So if you're an LP fan that liked Hybrid Theory, then pick this one up. If you didn't like Hybrid Theory well...then you're not an LP fan so don't buy it. This is definitely more of a rap album, there isn't much rock here.Oh, the cover art is pretty cool if you like that kind of stuff."
5,This Album ROCKS!!,"If you are a Linkin Park fan and have not yet heard this album....WHY???? This CD is nothing short of awesome. That being said, you WILL have to listen to it all the way through about 3 times before you begin to really appreciate the artistic license that has been taken on the great songs from the Hybrid Theory album. The absolute BEST song on the entire album is track 19, 1stp Klosr (One Step Closer). Along with the musical and lyrical changes we also get the added benefit of vocals by KoRn's Jonathan Davis. Jonathan and Chester's voices playing off one another is just AWESOME!!!!! It's worth the price of the album for this one song alone! Go out and buy this one today!"
4,Somewhat satisfactory,I have to admit the CD was not exactly what I expected. They had most of the songs from Hybrid Theory turned from hard rock to rap. But I still think it was definitely worth buying and I would highly recomend it.
5,awesome cd,linkin park is awesome. the way they blend hip-hop and rap with rock just blows my mind! and their vocals are so unique its just stellar. their new cd is great! they have taken a great thing [hybrid theory] and made it even better! it totally rocks! u need to go out right now and buy this cd!!!!
5,AMAZING,"this is an absolutely amazing cd. it is an absolute must buy for anyone, fan of linkin park or not."
4,almost as good as hybrid theory,"tis cd is not as hard rocking as hybrid theory but catchy my favs are pts of authority, enth e nd, p5hing me a*way (which is way better than the origional) 1step kloser and krwling. krwling is interenting because its a duo with chester and aaron lewis from the band staind personally staind [disappoints] big time. all thes songs are more electro and some of them u can dance to mr. hon (who is the dj for linkin park) contributed way more to this album than for the first. to sum it all up get this album because it sounds good and if you put it on your computer u can watch the video for pts. of authority which is very interseting.get this album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now"
3,Average,"This is an ok album. It seems like some kind of a filler to keep the time inbetween 2 very good albums. My favorite tracks are the X-ecutioner one and Hi Voltage. Whoever said the skits are cool is wrong, they are just stupid answering machine messages. Dont get me wrong, there are a lot of good things about Reanimation.Id say its an average CD."
4,REALLY GREAT CD,there are so many damn reviews so if you happen to read this i say this is great. Its quite different from Hybrid Theory. Its more hip-hop and rap-ish but if ya like the type of music go buy the friggin cd. I havent bought it yet but from hearing the samples of oints Of Authority and En TH nd (or h.e. u spell it) are great. I think it rox even tho it doesnt have a really rock sound. lotsa ppl may dissagree but i dont know what else to say. I love the new hip-hop-ish vibe in the songs. Unlike others i believe this IS worth your money. Just buy it and if ya dont like it go sell it on Ebay and get some of you precious dough back. I would. Dammit...i want this disc badly. Buy let me tell ya a lil secret...i dont know the band members names or much about em but muh freind had hybrid theory so um...i fell in love with it and intend to buy that too. so start with hybrid theory but i dont give so just go on...BUY IT!!
5,Reanimation,"I loved these songs! They weren't exactly better than the original songs, but they were different. Definitely a must-have for Linkin Park fans."
5,Go Buy It!,"I bought this cd the day it was released, and I am not disappointed! Don't take my word for it, just go and get it for yourself. If you are a Linkin Park fan, I think you will like it. If not, what the heck? Give it a try"
4,REANIMATION Is Hella Good,"Thi Linkin Park Cd I Great If u like Linkin Park and hate thi album u dont like Linkin Park!!!!! Thi Tight ...Ablum Featur Jay Gordan,Kutmater Kurt, and A new Raper form the Bay Area(my home town)Motion Man,Jonathan Davi(from KoRn),Aaron Lewi(from taind) Plus many more people and many more of the bet DJ'"
3,Good Mix,This album is good for its mix. The different artists having there mix on the origanal LP Hybrid Thorey. I do believe they could have done better but starting out they did great.
3,mixed feelings about it,well its got its ups and downs certain songs sound really good but then again y did they miss with the already great songs?!lolall in all i give it a 3 outta 5
5,Exactly what I expected...,"Linkin Park is everything they say they are, they are neither rock nor rap, its a hybrid theory that people still do not understand. If you are into strickly hard core rock or rock then I seriously think you should reconsider this album, if you are open to various sounds, riffs and samples then this is the album for you. The boys at Linkin park did a great job with their first album and on this one, they created a true hybrid theory,,,Good going guys."
1,What's next? The old songs BACKWARDS? Sounds GREAT!!!,"Seriously, their manager better have gotten fired, then flogged, and then sodomized by very very large animals of assorted breeds and sorts. I can just hear him now: ""Allright guys we forgot to book the studios so we figure your next album's gonna just be a bunch of mixing of your OlD songs. You take that song ook and save it for another day, we're milking this for all it's worth. And get this: meteora is just gonna be all THESE songs but played BACKWARDS! It'll be incredible, we'll drag 12 songs through the mud and get paid for it!""Linkin Park: If you haven't done it yet, fire whoever made this decision. Then have him flogged. And then sodomized."
1,What Happened?,"I absolutely love Linkin Park. Before I discovered it, I was absolutely against punk rock. Maybe this CD was why. I loved Hybrid Theory, so I bought Reanimation. All the songs were taken and twisted into almost unrecognizable garbage. Do not buy this CD if you enjoyed Hybrid Theory, because it will ruin it for you. If you want more Linkin Park, buy Meteora, it's really great."
1,Recycled ...,"Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory in 2000. Two years later, these hard working musicians manage, not to provide thousands of fans with a new album, but remix the songs from their debut album. No one in the history of music has ever had the balls to indulge themselves this much. Get off it guys! Time to write some new music; people WILL NOT stand for recycled .... This is something a band does after achieving a career's worth of success, which says alot. Time to step it up or fade away."
2,Hybrid Theory it's NOT!,"I love Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory is by far one of the best albums I've ever listened to in my life, musically and lyrically. So naturally I bought Reanimation becasue I loved Hybrid Theory.BIG MISTAKE.Points of Authority was an exception, but any song that the fellas from LP don't remix are pitifull. LP should have never let rap artist re-mix their songs. They take liberties: add in words, cut out words..ect. The remixers are really re-doing the songs, not re-mixing them. Take ""In the End"" for example. In the first few seconds of the song, we hear a rapper telling us that in the beginning, it was just Linkin Park. But then, it was...'Oh SHUT UP!' Quit trying to take the glory for the re-mix! It's so stupid how most mixers just screw up the songs.So if you have Hybrid Theory, keep it. But don't waste your time with this awful album. About 4 good songs isn't worth your time or money. Just wait until the boyz from LP come out with an album that only THEY do."
1,Mash up = crap,"This is your typical remix album, where a bunch of DJ's take a really good bunch of songs and mix, and mash them up until it sounds like crap. The original songs sounded so great, why mess with that? Also there's a lot of rapping on the album which isn't that great. I'm so tired of R&B; hip hop rap, and there's plenty of it on this album.There's one really good song, ""My December"", which is classic Linkin Park. They could have made a whole new album based on this song.When's Linkin Park coming out with a new album?!"
1,Very confused......,"I don't get it! So much rap on this CD! Not your normal LinkinPark =(. Get their other CD's, they are much better.*ADDITION* however, if you really like rap, then get this CD, it is full of rap."
2,piece O' S....,"what the heck is up with this album? All they did was take the good hybrid theory songs and every other song from singles/import and then they added sound f/x. O yea the CHORUS, 75% of the songs is chorus. and the music video(re animated ""Pts. Of. Athry.) which comes with the cd is stupid. Its about a alien war thing, Points of Authority isnt about war lol. I do not recomend this to anybody who really liked their first album. they were not original."
2,Digusting,"Sure this cd is basically a techno rehash of Hybrid theory, but it's definately not worth the money. Do urself a favor and either buy hybrid theory or wait for their new cd that's coming out this fall. They killed some of the greatest songs of all time. The only thing worth listening to is Pts.Of.Athrty(which doesn't stray far from the orginal), Frgt10, Wth>you, and maybe H! Vltg3. These can easily be downloaded from Kazaa and will seriously save u 15 bucks, fosheazy. PC and keep it real."
2,linkin park going techno!!! WTF!!!,"look linkin park is a great band but im startin to get the creeps that there turnin techno. Do yourself a favor and don't get this album, and don't encourage them for releasing this album, like that they will never think about releasing a remix album of them. If you want a good album buy them get hybrid theory or there new one meteora. The reason why i gave them 2 stars is because of the cover pleaes not."
5,Sweet,"Guess whos back... i'll give you a hint, THE BEST BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah you read correctly Linkin Park is back with their album reanimation. this is probably one of their best albums and it will forever stay in the minds of all linkin parks hardcore fans. if you bought hybrid theory and you liked it then u will love Reanimation. i definatly reccommend it to anyone who knows and likes linkin park and even to people who heard some of their song and enjoyed it."
3,c'mon,"i am a diehard fan of linkin park. there 1st cd was amazing, i love every track with the exception of trk 10. but there new album, reanimation has me really disappointed. i bought it thinking the cd would be mostly new material like my december but like many other fans i found myself listening to remixes. luckily i was introduced to this band through there 1st cd which made me a fan, so i can tolerate reanimation until lp comes out with a better album. if you never heard linkin park before then buy hybrid theory, you won't regret you did."
5,"A great album, flawless.","Iv'e heard a lot of remixes, some of which were even better than the original, but not by much. But this particular album blew.me.away! This whole album is a remixed version of their successful album hybrid theory. I'll admit, i was a skeptic, but once i heard the first track, i was in love. If you're new to linkin park, i suggest you start with hybrid theory or meteora. You know, just to get your feet wet. But Reanimiation is a definite buy for any lnkin park fan. Heck, they even added 4 extra trax along with the 14 from the debut album, all remixed, and one of the is My December.This album is, and has to be, one of a kind."
4,Not Just for Linkin Park Fans,"The songs are totally different than the originals. You don;t have to like the band to like this album. Some of the best artists in hip-hop do work on the album. I'm a big fan of underground hip-hop and Black Thought, Aceyalone, Chali 2na, Planet Asia and Pharohoe Monch do great work. Also the best in rock are enlisted for a few tracks including Johnathan Davis from Korn and Aaron Lewis from Staind. I highly recommend adding this to your collection."
3,"In the end, it's not very good...","First off, this CD falls short of Hybrid Theory's water mark by a long shot, but admitted that's a lot to live up to. So fan's waited about 3 years and this is what we are given, a bunch of retooled, recycled, and retarded remixes. my advise is buy it from the bargain bin or just down load it, not worth you money..."
3,"This CD is ""ok""","I waited for this CD with great anticipation. After listening to it, I am disappointed with it. Maybe I don't like it that much because it doesn't even come close to the original that I loved or maybe it was because it really isn't that good.People that enjoy more hardcore rap/hip hop may like this CD more then Hybrid Theory but I seriously doubt that individuals who fall more on the rock side will like this CD.If you are going to spend some money on a CD, I would say pick up a good bargain like FLAW or an incredible rap/rock band called Reveille (CD Name: Bleed the Sky)."
3,Not as Good as the Others,"The remixes for the first 5 tracts are what drags this entire album by at least one star. Linkin Park can easily hold its own, on its own, and it does not need remixes to reinforce that fact. However, not all the songs are busts. ""Pushing me Away,"" is better remixed than it is in its original form in Hybrid Theory. They completely destroyed ""In the End,"" probably my favorite Linkin Park song. There are a few new songs on here, but they do not make too big an impact on the whole album."
2,linkin park?,"I was extremly impressed with ""Hybrid Theory"" and was impationtly wating for this Release. I got it the first day it came out at 10 am. Needless to say I wasn't to pleased.Mike Shinoda, who did the whole thing, screwed it up. Hyrbrid Theory came out with screaming, good guitars, and GOOD MUSIC. Then the remixes came out and most of them are either to ""Rappy"" or ""Techonoy"" or something. The hard-rocking Forgotten was turned into a slow techno rap song. In the End was runined. And there was only 4 songs I was pleased with, ""with you remix"" ""one step closer remix"" ""crawling remix"" and ""cure for the itch remix"". I recomend it for anyone whos a fan of techno or rap. Head Bangers will haft to wait for their next album."
1,...,"one word. this is the worst cd ever. i love hybrid theory, which is probably why i hate this cd so much. hybrid theory had just the right mix of rock and rap. this cd is all rap/hip-hop/.... this is not linkin park. why would you change something that was so great to begin with? i think linkin park are the biggest sellouts ever. don't get this cd. If you want a good cd, go out and get finch or offspring. this is not music."
1,Bad news,"This is just wrong, I really really do not like this dont get me wrong I like Linkin Park. I really have respect for bands that combine rap into there great rock music but like most remake cd's this one just fails, I really hope LP gets in the studio to make a new cd they have milked this one completley dry"
2,OMG!!!,OMG! They have totally ruined all the good stuff found on Hybrid Theory!p.s. and i actally said they were my fave? Ya Right!
2,Wait for new material...,"I'm sorry - I can't agree with what has been said here. Admittedly, I bought the CD blind. I had no clue what the jewel case contained within. All I knew was Linkin Park had come out with a new CD and I HAD TO HAVE IT. I absolutely LOVED Hybrid Theory and was expecting something along those lines - incredible melodies, strong vocals, and FRESH MATERIAL.What I got was a complete re-hash of Hybrid Theory, but the MUSIC is gone and replaced with rap. It's almost as if Fred Durst had hijacked my beloved Linkin Park and forced them to follow his talentless lead. Listening to Reanimation I felt the same hollowness and betrayal as when I first listened to Significant Other - I just blew [price] on a POC CD.Save your money and wait until Linkin Park is FREED from this drivel. I resent paying money for a place-holder. The same effect can be had by putting Hybrid Theory in your CD player and hitting the >> button at random.Your mileage may vary."
1,Extremely disappointed by this CD,"Let me start by saying that I loved Hybrid Theory. I thought it was one of the most innovative rock CD's ever. So after 2 years I was looking forward to some more of that innovation. Unfortunately, Reanimation has nothing new. As others have said, its a straight-up remix CD and its not even a good remix. Its also more hip-hop than rock. So unless you want to buy a hip-hop remix of Hybrid Theory, I would suggest passing on this CD. Hopefully Linkin Park will stay true to its roots and record another ROCK CD, and forget putting out lame studio remix CD's."
1,Awful Trash,"How could Linkin Park do this to their fans. The only decent track on this CD is the Points of Authority single. I feel deeply cheated by this album. I hope this genre of remix albums dies here. How can you try to better the best album of 2001.....impossible. I am extremely open minded about all music and do like certain rap and hip hop but this is plain trash. A bunch of wannabes trying to make their names by remixing linkin Parks songs and failing miserably. Save your money and please, please Linkin Park don't sell this rubbish to your fans. Stay original and fresh and bring us more unique tunes."
2,Big Letdown,"What brought me to buy Reanimation were several songs I heard on websites. I think they're a unique and very talented band. However, if I knew this CD had all of these techno/hip hop remixes on it, I would have bought ""Hybrid Theory"" instead. I bought this CD yesterday and it's on ebay today."
2,Buy Hybrid Theory instead,"Now I know this CD took A TON of talent to make. And there's no denying Linkin Park has that talent. They're a great band. But this CD is just remixes of the already great songs off of Hybrid Theory, plus some old songs. These songs really did not tickle me pink. The originals are a lot better. The only remix I found myself toe-tapping to was the remix of In The End.I bought this CD because I love Linkin Park, and that was enough for me. And though it took incredible mixing talent to make this, buy Hybrid Theory instead. The remixes are too weird for me. The originals will do you much better."
2,Hybrid Theory Gets Gangsta?,"I am actually one of those people who enjoy Linkin Park's music. I feel that their combination of nu-metal and rap works fairly well and has lead them to some great music. This, however, is a disgrace to anyone who enjoyed their music.The CD consists of theirHybrid TheoryCD remixed with a few other tracks. The remixes are mostly horrible and are very annoying. They basically just took Hybrid Theory and turned it into a badly made Rap album. The new tracks aren't good either and I'd honestly consider them some of the worst of the disk.The few positives are that some of the songs like Crawling actually turned out very good. This CD lacks enough of these good songs to actually make this worth purchasing. Check out their new CD,Minutes to Midnight, if you want to hear real Linkin Park."
2,Reanimation is not very good.,"I seriously dislike this album.Maybe its because I am not very big into this type of music on Reanimation,who knows.But all I know is that this isn't really good.Almost everything on here is a remix,and I prefer new work than just remixes.The new songs aren't that great,either.I'm not a Linkin Park hater- far from one.I thought 'Hybrid Theory' was pretty good but this is just garbage.Don't waste any money on this."
5,"""better animated""",When i first heard linkin park was putting out a remix album i was upset. I wanted to hear new material. but i found it was. Reanimation was totally different. some songs were not as good as the ones on hybrid theory but were good.heres a comparison on the songs.hybrid re-animatedone step closer betterbetter papercutcrawling betterrunaway betterbetter in the endpts. of authority betterplace for my head betterby myself betterpushes me away betterwith you betterbetter forgottenmy december betterhigh voltage bettercure 4 the itch betterWell its 11-3 reanimation so [REANIMATION] WINS!!!!
5,AWESOME CD!!!!,I bought this cd the first day it was out being a huge fan of Linkin Park and was very impressed with 80% of the cd. Some of it I didn't like but for the most part I would recommend it to others. I loved the cd over all.
4,Remixes Full of Power!,I think these are the best remixes I have heard in a long time. They have newer better elements that I wouldn't have even thought would work. I would buy this CD with or without being a Linkin Park fan.
4,a good alternative for hybrid theory...,"Even without me being a huge fan of linkin park [I love LP!], I could tell you this album was really good. I thought it showed another side of LP than that of Hybrid Theory.Many people will contest and say that LP is purely a rock band, and they sold out on this cd, but the truth is they are not entirely a rock band-thus the emcee and the dj.LP is a blend between rap/hip hop and rock. Reanimation really showed the lyrical and production skills of Mike Shinoda, LP and all the other guests on the album. Truthfully, some songs I felt were diced up a bit too much-but the beats, lyrics and some kuts overpowered that fault so overall the album is hot. Go get it!P.S. Joseph Hahn is soooo hot! ;)"
3,Great for a remix album,"I have to say Linkin Park, gives great effort on this remix album, and that's all it should be looked at as, a remix album. Most people took this a little too seriously, saying it was leading to new sound from linkin park. There are some great tunes on here, Pushing Me Away gives a new feeling compared to the original, with new lyrics added on to it. My December, even though not as good as the original (of course) it does sound great, this is a great album to have, and to just have fun listening to, Linkin Park, just sounds like they're having fun here, and that's all this album is, it's LP having fun."
4,You shouldn't tamper with good music,"Alright, alright...now let's get one thing straight. Linkin Park is one of the best bands in the world, but their remix totally disappointed me. There's too much rap related beat and singing in it, not the Linkin Park I know and love.However, if you like Linkin Park, I would give their remix and chance. Just listen to it before you buy it."
1,Say it aint so,"Linkin Park had the perfect combonation of rock and rap, this album is entirely rap. I like the first couple songs on the CD, but I sure hope their next album will have the balance that made them so successfull to begin with."
1,DO NOT LIKE,"I thought that this CD would be as great as the Hybird Theory.It def is not.I loved the Hybird Theory CD but I think this CD ruins all the songs,the remixs are very weird and ruin all the songs.Its def not as good as hybird theory.I can't wait for Linkin Park to come out with something brand new not just a new CD with remixs of there songs that are on Hybird Theory CD.I am very disappointed in this CD."
1,Hybrid Theory just got worse,"This band just might as well go completely rap. There are bands out there that I thought were the most rap-influenced rap metal out there like Crazy Town and (old) Primer 55 but neither of them made an almost all rap remake of their old album. This band, first of all, must be completely incapable of writing new songs because they've been living off of Hybrid Theory for the past 3 years now and instead of releasing a new CD they re-mix their old album as if it wasn't bad enough already. If you like rap or techno, only then would I recommend this CD to anyone."
2,Eck! Not rock at all!,"If you truely like the rock style of Linkin Park, don't buy this cd. The only good songs are KRWLNG, RNW@Y, and a few others. Most of it just techno/rap with other people singing. Try Meteora instead..."
2,Same Songs Over Again,"Pretty good for a remix album, but remix albums tend to be pretty weak, so that's not saying much. I suppose rap fans might like what they did with ""In the End"" or ""Papercut"" but overall there wasn't much improvement. ""My December"" was originally an amzing song but it was totally murdered on Reanimation. It's too bad the original wersion is not on any albums except some expensive import cds. ""Crawling"" is the only reason to buy this album. Aaron Lewis and Chester are AWESOME together and the violin part makes ""Crawling"" totally amazing and the best song on the album by a long, long way. However, if Linkin Park really wants to be recognized, they need to come out with new music instead of recycling old tunes."
4,Sweetness!!! The LP hits return,"Alright, here's the story. This isnt just some cheap collection of Remixes, its an entirely new artistic interp of the old stuff. This is LP at their best, with some of the other big names chiping in, and almost all of it is better in a different way than the original. Good stuff, includes My December and the best version of With You thats ever been made. A definite must-have."
3,Just another remix CD,"The songs on this album sound quite different than their Hybrid Theory counterparts, and sometimes the difference is pleasant(some songs remind me of the good old days of old school hip hop). There are even remixed versions of songs that didn't make it onto their first Album.But through it all, Reanimation is just another remix CD(maybe they took a page from NIN's book?), albeit a decent one. The songs on this CD have a much mor hip hop'ish feel to them, which some might enjoy, but I didn't. Most of the songs lacked the energy and hooks of the songs from Hybrid Theory. The result is a well-produced, but ultimately boring album. Unless you're a hardcore Linkin Park fan don't bother buying Reanimation."
2,Dose not match up to Hybrid Theory,"It's okay, their first was really good, but why not just take the time to make another really good CD? Instead they made this remix CD, its dissappointing to me. I don't think you sould buy it, but if you dont have Linkin' Park: Hybrid Theory, then I advise you to go out and buy it."
2,dont be fooled,"to all linkin park fans - You'll probably buy this even when I tell you that this CD [is weak], but it does. I really liked ""Hybrid Theory"" and some additional songs I've heard by Linkin Park, but this album is really bad. I'd give it 1 star, but the songs are, after all, just re-mixes of ""Hybrid Theory"" which I really liked.to all those interested in linkin park - Do NOT let this album be your introduction to Linkin Park. They have so much more to offer! Buy Hybrid Theory, and even if you like that, I wouldn't reccommend this CD.to anyone else - If you don't like Linkin Park, and aren't interested in hearing any of their stuff, then why are you reading this in the first place?"
3,a pathetic follow up,it was an alright cd but it wasnt no hybrid theory. I dont like rap and i am disappoined that linkin park went to that. i am a rocker and i hope linkin park can come back to the hard rock style that was showed in hybrid theory. if you dont like rap dont get this cd
5,the perfect remixed rap CD,"An awsome cd that beats the heck out of other Linkin Park cd's.It is a loud rap cd, and although Linkin Park doesn't sing or play in the whole cd, the remixes RULE!I listend to it on a bus to Tallahasee and was hooked to the cd so fast I had no chance of turning back. This is definitly the best cd you will ever listen to in your lifetime."
3,Its ok...but it could be better,"Ok look, i found out Linkin Park made a new cd the smae day i got it. Well just becasue a band makes an awsome first cd doesnt mean it will happen again. The djs were cool and stuff but i want the old style Linkin Park not a Rap cd. The cd is ok, but if your into rock dont buy this becasue you might be disapointed. dude all you rock fans out there that want a new rock cd get Disterbed's coming soon. Peace"
3,An alright remix,"First off, In the End. They completely butchered it. I try to skip that one as much as possible. And what's with all those phone calls? I want to hear music, not your answering machine. Some of the songs did get beter, like Crawling. They somehow managed to make an already perfect song even better. I kinda think they cheapened thier original album but I was able to get used to the changes. After all, if you don't like a song, you can always just skip it."
4,Thumbs up,"Linkin park listened to their gym teachers when they were growing up and obviously remembered them saying ""Quality over Quantity"" when they made their albums. Reanimation however, is an exception to that rule. It averages at about an hour and completely redefines what a remix album is. It feels like an entire new experience which is the best thing you can possibly do with a remix album. It's definately an album you'll want to pick up, but hip hop haters should beware, it does have quite a bit of rap in it."
3,Linkin Park's misguided album.,"Now, i was as big a linkin park fan as anyone, until i bought this album, that is. not to say the album is all bad. there are some good remixes like 1stp klosr, pts.of.athrty, by_myslf, and P5hng me a*wy, but overall, it destroys hybrid theory. if you haven't heard HT yet and are a fan of both rap and rock, you'll love this, but HT was the best album ever, and you experienced euphoria listening to it. reanimation ruins all that. its just annoying when you're listening to tracks like frgt/10 andplc.4 mie haed and this unknown rapper cuts in with an overly aggravating verse. to make things worse, in the end, the best track of hybrid theory, has been butchered into enth e nd, the worst track on Reanimation. this album has some good tracks, but i would wait until its thrown in the bargain bin."
5,A Great Remix Album,"This is the best remix album of the year.This is a cd that you can listen to all the way through with out skipping a song. It's Hybrid Theory remixed with more of a hip hop sound. If you like rap, Hybrid Theory, or you're just a linkin park fanatic, then purchase this cd."
4,"A Good Remix CD, but LP still needs a new album soon","I bought this album the day it came out, and i listened to it at least twice on that day. My first impression was that it was just a remix album, and not much more. The second day I listened to it, and I liked it a lot. The change from rock dominating rap on ""Hybrid Theory"" to vice versa on ""Reanimation"" is something you get used to pretty quick. A lot of guest dj's and rappers also make this a good cd. the dude from staind brought great changes to ""crawling"", IMHO, and all the rappers like motion man and black thought added flavor too. if you like linkin park, definetly get this to tide you over til' the next ""real"" album comes out"
3,OK if you're more into the rap and dont mind edited songs,"A hastily thrown-together remix album, Reanimation focuses on the band's rap and techno sides, ignoring the fact that they have a large rock following. A few of the tracks feature prominent rock artists, like Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis, but even their songs do not make it worth the price of the whole album."
5,Best Linkin Park CD,I just picked up a copy of this cd cause I have heard alot of thier hybrid theroy songs well because my friend had it then i heard of reanimation and linkin park has outdone themselves with Reanimation with the awesome remix of Enth e nd and Krwling I really hope that the come out wit a Reanimation to Meteora And I would like to hear a remix of Faint Great Song!!!!!!! But anyway i reccomend this 2 all linkin park fans and rock fans!!!!!
1,Disappointing at best,"I love Hybrid Theory, but in it's original form. Reanimation is a remix version that provides nothing new. I will borrow a friends copy of LP's next album before buying it. I won't be burned again."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK,"when i heard linkin park was going to make a remix album of hybrid theory, i knew it was going to be bad. all remix albums are bad, so my friend fei xenogear (also posted here) let me borrow his copy of reanimation...and i was right, it has to be the worst album i have ever heard...i'd rather listen to my sisters copy of TLC's fan mail, i didn't think anything could be as bad as that, guess i was wrong"
1,Blah,"The only thing that's less original, and more greedy, than making an album with no originality (""Hybrid Theory""), is making a remix album. If they're really looking to squeeze every penny from us, why don't they make a live album? Oh no wait, they did!"
2,Ehhh.,"Another garaunteed multi million selling cd for mega money conglomerate Money Park. They should feel ashamed of themselves taking advantage of their poor fans like they do. They know the kids will eat it up no matter what kind of unlistenable trash it is, so they release it to scam a little cash on the side. Tsk Tsk Tsk. I actually enjoy Meteora and Hybrid Theory, despite the fact that they are a tad overrated, Linkin Park is a good band. Just stay away from reanimation, it's really not worth it. The only reason it got TWO stars is because Steve from Taproot is on it, but not even he can save this garbage."
2,is this Linkin Park-?,i love LP .. this is the reason why i bought Reanimation on it's release dateBUT .. LP steps onto their hip/hop side to leave alternative fans hungry .. composed of mainly rap and throbbing beats .. there is no longer beauty in their tunes .. admist all the remix and cameos by outside artists .. LP lost their true identity which is disappointing.

This is all we here from these machines when we use them, which isn't often. Kids click on the pictures to elicit related and often unrelated noises - that is it. There is little actual phonics training. The phonics ""games"" only ask about one softball question per minute surrounded by a lot of ADD attention getting fluff. These are entertainment systems, not educational systems. We should note that the Leapfrog brand DVDs we have are not like the Leappads at all. The DVDs are very good. The Leappads are worthless."
3,Just like every actor wants to be a director...,"Peter Sinfield was the ""man behind the curtain""on the first several King Crimson albums and on the odd Emerson Lake & Palmer cut, contributing his sometimes dark and always enigmatic lyrics. This ""silent partner"" arrangement seems to be an almost exclusively English phenomenon- e.g. Keith Reid (Procol Harum)Bernie Taupin (Elton John). There are some songwriters who excel at songwriting, but not necessarily as vocalists (read: Dylan,Randy Newman,Burt Bacharach). We have to add Pete Sinfield to that list. That being said,this one-off 70's curio is still a worthwhile addition to your prog-rock collection, mainly due to contributions from the likes of Greg Lake,whose sudden appearance on the chorous of the title cut is breathtakingly dynamic, especially when contrasted with Sinfield's unfortunate monotone vocals. However, the songs are uniformly good, with haunting melodies and Sinfield's patented lyric style. A qualified recommendation."
3,"generally good, but not as good as his king crimson material","For those who are completists of progressive rock this is essential, otherwise not. Some good songs and some familiar accomplices such as Greg Lake, but lacks the potency of Sinfield's King Crimson lyrics. Generally worth a listen, I perticularly like the last song on the album."
3,Good,"For those who very much like the first two King Crimson albums, this is as a very good bonus to both of them. Various musical scetches in old time romantics.A gently confession of himself."
3,Still,"If you've heard the first three King Crimson records, then you've some idea where this album *could* be heading. Unfortunately Sinfield gets wrapped up in his own delicate musings. That said, there are some Lizard-esque moments, ""Under The Sky"" is particularly nice. In fact that's perhaps the problem with the entire album, it's just tooooo nice! Go for McDonald & Giles instead - that one won't let you down!"
2,For Pete's Sake,"God, Pete. If you're going to be prolix, at least make sense. Remember: less can be more. And if you must be ""poetic,"" remember: the line between ""art"" and ""baloney"" ain't all that thin to begin with. And if you're going to use all your friends on your album, remind them that their best work need not be behind them even if yours is. Don't alter the running order for the sake of the ""new"" material when you reissue it. And if you're going to take a jab at a conspicuously absent former band-member (""the Black Pick""? I mean, really--just say it) at least remember it was never your band to begin with and get over it. And fer cryin' out loud, Pete--use someone else as your producer. The sound is as thin as the veneer on your, like, deep lyrics. Nice cover, though. And ""Under The Sky"" and ""The Piper"" are pleasant enough. So is ""Song Of The Seagoat."""
4,Raw Data Comes Alive,"I have done some extended genealogical research, and that alone can be fulfilling and at times exciting. But I found myself wishing I could fill in the gaps that mere archival records did not reveal. Lalita Tademy was able to flesh out her ancestors and tell their story, albeit fictionalized, but what an accomplishment! Not a classic in the literary sense, but written in a way that most genealogists would give anything to be talented enough to write. Give her credit for recognizing a very interesting family history, and give her female ancestors credit for giving her this remarkable story."
5,This book kept me up all night,"Lalita Tademy pulled me right into her family. I came to care so much about these women that I couldn't stop, I had to see what came next. She handles the different cultures represented (slave to free, free creole, French emigre, white southern) so well that everyone's motivations seem to make perfect sense as you move through the changing scene. In 2001 it's not easy to understand the fathers' abilities to separate their emotional ties from their social ""obligations,"" but this book leaves me with no doubt that's the way it was. If this were a novel, I would want the family to leave Louisiana and marry the men they love, but history wrote it another way."
4,Excellent historical fiction,"African American historical fiction is extremely difficult to find. This is a find! Rarely have I read a story so demonstrative of the burdens of the slave family and so loving and compassionate at the same time. Many times I found tears in my eyes at the suffering the family endured. At other times, I found myself angry for the women in the family who were being used and used up!Tademy was wise to leave Silicon Valley to write this story. How exciting it must have been for her.Pass this book around in your family, as I have in mine!"
4,Compelling and captivating,"This book was fascinating to me. I listened to it, rather than reading the book. Because there were so many French names in it, I think I was able to enjoy it more in its spoken version. The reader, Robin Miles, brought each of the characters alive with her excellent reading style.I live in Minnesota, with no direct experience of Southern living and its history. There is much to be learned from this story. The combination of historical data and personalities of the people whose lives were portrayed make it a worthwhile read!"
3,Lou'siana Bayou Country!,"I finished CANE RIVER just last week and found it very interesting how 5 generations of slave women coped with their horrendous situation. I hope this book will inspire people to do geneological research about their families. Sincerely, K.A."
3,Realistically Saddened,"This story is relatively realistic in its references to the ""color-struck"" syndrome that yet exits among black people. As always, the class structure is a reminder that intelligent human beings still do not appreciate the uniqueness that God has created. Racial prejudice is rampant in this story, and that (plus the things listed above) is what saddens me most. The Cane River women live by a code of survival that is admirable because they are the root of the family. However,I fail to see the uniqueness of THIS story. Who says that lighter is better? Do we have to accept that? What is success within the family, community, society, nation, or the world even? This story is a reminder of the valuable things about our history, as well as the ugly reality that is still with us so many years later than the perils of the women of Cane River."
5,American History,"A great true story about an American Family. This story details the tragedy, joy, struggles and life accomplishments of one American Family."
4,from author of simple grace,"Simple Grace: Living a Meaningful Lifeif you are trying to decide....the answer is YES, you must buy this. from this fan....beth jannery, author of simple grace"
4,creoles,Really enjoyed this book. I loved the combination of fact and fiction and the famliy photos. It flowed well and was interesting. It's amazing how times have changed and how racist this country was and is.
4,Makes you think,"If I had not heard reviews of this book I would not have read, but was glad that I did. Enjoyed it and still think about some racial issues since reading."
2,"Good idea, but the writing did not hold me captive","I have taken a break from reading this book after going through one-third of the story. I think the idea to chronicle the author's family history is a great one, and I'd like to read the rest of the book at some point. However, the writing does not keep me interested enough. At times I feel that the symbolism is forced and that any poetic nature is lost. I'm not led to care about the characters."
5,Cane River,My mother was born in Cloutierville on the Cane River and use to tell me about the type of life she and other Caroles of color had during the early 20th century. This book vividly brings to life my mothers description of how it was to live in a society were gradations in your skin color gave you greater benefits while treating you as something less than human. There are many Cane River family stories such as the one told in this book. I could not put the book down until I had finished it. This family typifies the interraceial relationships which exsisted between white male slave owners and their female slaves.
5,Historically correct and bringing it to life,"The Creole people and their lives came alive in this well written book. We are given a view into what has made the Creoles of Louisiana who they are. What I liked best about this book is being able to see into their lives and what the slave family felt. It's not just ""another"" book about the unjustness of slavery. It opens up their lives, bringing life even in the face of oppression. Even facing it with the strength of will to overcome it and come out better in the end, in spite of it all. I didn't want the ""intrusion"" into their lives to end. Beautiful!"
4,very detail very good storyline,I really enjoyed the book I first saw Lalita's story on Oprah I went out the same weekend and purchased the book I myself came from a very mixed family and I'm of dark descent this book really hit home for me andmade me open my eyes about things in my own life.
4,Good Book,"The story of her family history is very interesting. I enjoyed the book, the character development could have been better."
3,Disappointing,"I read the book because of the very complimentary reviews but was disappointed. The writing, I'm sorry to say, is very mediocre. A much better book on the subject of slavery is The Known World by Edward Jones. I couldn't put it down and the writing is superior, lyrical and excellent in every way."
4,Worth The Time,"While the book seemed to loose steam near the end, it was well worth the time to read. Most of the main characters are well written and vivid. My only disappointment was Emily--the last of the women portrayed. That she was chronologically the most recent made me feel she should have been better developed, as there are surely people still alive who remember her. This is a minor inconvenience, however. The women are bright and alive and the history of the time and place shine in Tademy's writing"
3,good read,"An interesting generational story, and certainly worth reading for a deeper understanding of the cruelty and horror for African Americans during the Civil war (pre-post-past). I found it a good read, but not exceptional."
4,Good story; didn't have flow I expected,"Maybe she is planning 2nd book; I would like to hear about the next several generations of women. Maybe none of them did anything spectacular. I was hoping some of these women were instrumental in the civil rights movement, were educated and so on. I would think that info would be much easier for her to obtain, maybe she is only interested in the women of slavery."
4,Cane River,Good historical fiction. Sheds light on the effects on biracial children post Civil War.Good read. Interesting how the women held the families together.
5,I loved this book.,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.Very well written and engaging. Read it.. I'm certain you won't be disappointed! THis is an excellent book club selection.
4,Cane River,"Could not put this book down. I read it during the day and took it to bed with me at nite and spent hours reading. It is a real page turner.The authors ability to put ""you in the action"" is incredible."
3,cane river,"I purchased this for my 85 year old Aunt because it was an Oprah pick. I have not read it myself, so I can only report my Aunt's opinion. She did not enjoy this book as much as she does her favorite authors. I do not know if it was the story or the writing, but she stated she does not care to have any more of this authors books."
2,I Struggled With This One.,"For some reason I just couldn't get caught up in this story. There was something unreal about it and I couldn't ""buy"" all of the things that were happening. From the very beginning of the book the main character seems not to have an understanding of the difference between herself, a slave, and her mistress. Granted, she was 10, but it seems to me that by that age her parents would have tried to clue her in to the realities of life so that she would be able to handle and survive. Instead they just seemed to let her act and believe that she was different and it was hard and painful when she had to come to terms wiht life as it was. As a ""family history"" kind of book this book seemed to be infused with too much fantasy about how life was and it was still unbelievable as a novel."
2,Lousy,"I was very excited to read this book. I didn't bother to continue after the first several chapters however. Its too bad really because its a great concept to spin a yarn from one's heritage but I found the verbiage forced and clearly written by an amatuer. Since I'm not a writer, I expect to read books written by people who can write better than I can. In this case, I felt like I was reading a story written by a teenager whose English teacher assigned her the task of writing a story. That's the last time I will bother with ""Oprah's"" club...that endorsement alone should have made me know better. The last book I read was by Pat Conroy and while his books might be more about ""fluff"" than this, the literary value is so superior, perhaps that was the problem. Literature is a gift...you either have it or you don't.This one didn't."
3,dissapointed,"Am I the only dissapointed reader? I found the research behind the story impressive, the subject matter fascinating. But, I found the writing to be average, at best. I could not get into any of the characters. I felt as though I was watching them from the outside. I had no emotional tie to them. I was so dissapointed because the book was so highly rated on amazon as well as oprah. I feel as though Oprah chose the book simply because of the subject matter. I feel as though I have been ""duped."" Subject matter does not make a good story. A reader needs emotion from the characters. This story had none."
4,Love this book...A must read,"This is an awesome book about the trials & tribulations of women trying to survive. They are not perfect, but defintely to be respected for enduring rape, slavery, abuse, and death. Ms. Tademy makes you feel deeply for her characters and you want to follow their lives. She created so many things to love about this book a sense of survival, betterment, a fierce love of family, and intelligent women who one would want to emulate. ""The Wind Done Gone"" doesn't reach out to you like this book."
3,Cane River keep flowing,"It was a story, not a particularly good or engaging story but a story. If you want to read the same old stories about slavery, Cane river is the book for you. The only thing that gives it any value is that is it based on real people with real names that are identified in the story."
3,"CANE RIVER BY LALITA TADEMY (BOOK, USED)","THE BOOK WAS A BIT TATTERED, BUT STILL IN GOOD CONDITION, AS IT WAS USED. NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL. THANK YOU!"
5,She took you there,"I really enjoyed this book, Lalita actually took you there with the characters. I've tried to start a family tree just because of this book. The women in the story are very strong and this is a page turner, high five to you Lalita."
5,A must Read for True History Lovers,"The real history of the south is not always pretty, and this true account of the author's family demonstrates some of the not talked about facts of life as a slave. But, what really struck me was that though family was sometimes separated and hardships were endured... the most important thing to the matriarchs of this family remained FAMILY. The women in this book were so inspiring to me and I admire their courage and perserverence. Such pride and strenghth of character! I felt that I knew each one of them and looked back often at the pictures of the proud women depicted. The author has not only a well written book to be extremely proud of, but a great family tradition as well! This was one of the best books I've read in years."
5,Go get 'em Aunt 'Lita,Just wanted to plug my favorite Aunt. Can't wait for the next one. Hurry up!!!!Brennan Lothery
5,Amazing story...based on history and rich characters,"I read this book in no time flat! The research the author did must have been tremendous. Tademy brought these women to life, and of course she had never met them. What a gift to give her family by honouring them in their past.I live in Canada and slavery is not as large a part of our history as what it has been in the US. (although it did exist) In school, we really never learned about this sad part of history and my sources have only been in movies and TV. This book brought slavery and its tragedy to life. What it must have been like to have your family sold off and seperated. I cannot imagine it, yet Tademy documents it and you know it happened and it was real.You will love Elisabeth, Suzette, Philomene and Emily; four generatations of strong women to admire and cry with. This book was a wonderful read, and worth 5 stars."
5,Not like Oprah's previous selections,"I've been hesitant to buy a book ""endorsed"" by Oprah, because they all have seemed so dark, solemn and depressing. However, this book hooked me and dragged me in, and I can't praise it highly enough. It's an uplifting story of generations of strong women, each of whom chooses a path that seems to provide greater strength for the daughters yet to come. Do yourself a favor, and buy this book. Then find a quiet chair in a corner and immerse yourself in the power of determination, courage and strength. You'll think about these women long after you've closed the book......and isn't that why we love to read in the first place?"
5,"You'll Learn, Cry, Be Entertained & Totally Swallowed Up!","Normally I don't care even a little bit for fictionalized versions of true stories, but this is a GLOWING EXCEPTION. In fact, this is one the best books I've read all year! This story swallows you up in its vivid portrayal of the lives of these slaves, unbelieveably not all that very long ago. It also taught me about the class system within the ""black"" community in the South of which I was totally unaware. Lalita Tademy may have been a shiny success in the business world, but that achievement pales in comparison to this incredible, heartrending story she has researched and shared about her own family history. This would make a dynamite movie. I'm going to order another copy right now and send it to my mother."
3,My opinion of Cane River,"I do not know why, but I could not really get into this book. I usually enjoy narratives such as this, but I just could not enjoy it to the fullest. I think it took me almost a week to finish it (I read Alex Haley's Queen in a matter of hours!).My recommendation is read it, and draw your own conclusions. I am not sure if this is Ms. Tademy's first book or not, but if it is, I'm sure her 2nd try will be better :-)"
3,An excellent read!,"Well done Ms. Tademy! Fascinating, informative, and totally enjoyable. I love reading (black)genealogical/ancestorial/historical-related works."
5,My family tree...,"is so boring compared to this! I liked this book a lot. I loved the descriptions of the characters, so real and easy to imagine. The women were easy to like. I do wish it was all fact or all fiction. I think the author did a diservice to her family tree by adding 'stories'."
3,Cane River,"I enjoyed this fictitious account of the author's family, but it really hit home towards the end of the book with the pictures of T.O. and his offspring. It reminded me a lot of Jubilee. A good one to have in your personal library. 3.5 stars!"
5,Cane River,"One of the best books I've ever read. I've shared it with many, but it will remain in my library."
3,Cane River (Okay),"I liked a lot of it and I am proud and amazed at how Lalita Tademy researched her heritage and the fictional account of how she put it all together. It seemed a little rushed at the end, but I still liked it. On a scale of one to 5, I would give it a 3.GOD BLESS,Tamara"
5,Cane River,"This was the most moving book I have ever read. I could not put it down. The charicters were so real. I felt I knew them personally. I worried for them, cried for them and bonded with them. My family is from this part of Louisiana and of mulatto blood. I felt as if these women could have been my ancesters. I could really relate to their struggle, strentgh and courage. This is a book every women should read regardless of color."
5,Enlightening,"As my last name is Fredieu and the author's great grandmother was the daughter Narcease Fredieu, it immediatly got my interest to say the least. I have been raised as white my whole life and still may be only white, but the idea that so much I did not know, made both proud and curious to know that I have relatives of all race. I would love to hear from the author if possible. She can reach me at 318-688-5854 in Shreveport, La. is she wishes. P.S- I was raised in Grant parish/ Montgomery, La. My entire family on both my father & mothers' side were raised in the grant/natchitoches parish areas."
5,Must Read!,"An absolute MUST read! Excellent content. Her writing makes you feel as if you were there. I was into the book sooooo much, that I actually had a dream about it. Good Job Mrs. Tademy!"
4,Powerful And Educational,"Cane River is a work of fiction, yet it's based on historical fact and the author's own family history. It explores early race relations between African-Americans and Caucasians, as well as race relations within the African-American community itself. As powerful as Cane River is, though, I personally would've preferred a book based ENTIRELY on historical fact, but sadly the author didn't have that option as so much African-American history has been lost or ignored throughout the generations."
4,Cane River Cruise,"This was my book group's choice for this month and we had a wonderful discussion of the emotionally charged story of Lalita Tademy's heritage. Do not be deterred by the huge family tree at the beginning of this book. You need only follow along and will quickly see that this is the story of four strong women, who, through the generations, support their families. My only complaint would be that, when Tademy got to the end of her saga -- to the 20th century -- she seemed to speed up and this suffered as this section was not as detailed, the characters not as fully formed, as the generations that came before."
5,A caring look back at a painful time,"In this fictionalized account of her ancestors, Lalita Tademy tells a remarkable multigenerational tale of slavery and freedom through the eyes of four mothers and daughters. During slavery, these women struggle to keep their families intact as they are too often reminded that their bodies are not truly their own and as their men and children are sold away.When slavery ends, the women and their family must adjust to a societal bullwhip that keeps everyone, black and white, in what is supposed to be their proper places. This book makes you feel the complicated and devastating impact of slavery and color on both interracial and intraracial relationships."
3,Cane River,"Although this was a history of a family, I felt that I could not identify with a lot of the characters. it was a genealogy book without much character development. Also, numerous characters went from age 9 to age 14 without a backward glance."
1,Not for serious readers of literature or history,"Congratulations to Lalita Tademy for leaving her job as a CEO to research and write a book. One imagines that she was better at business then prose. To be kind, the writing is slip shod. No characters, not even the main ones, are more than stick figures. Why they make the choices they do is left a total mystery. Tademy has bravely taken on the ambitious task of telling the stories of three of her ancestors, two of whom lived much of their lives as slaves in Louisiana. She's bitten off far too much, often jumping the story years ahead seemingly at whim. I literally tossed the book in the air at the mention of Lincoln assuming the presidency in November 1860 (the month of his election, four months before taking office). For serious students of history, Cane River is more annoying than enlightening.Cane River is about important and compelling issues that surrounded the lives of many female slaves. Such a book should not be left in the hands of novice."
2,BORING!!!,"I've read many slave narratives written by real slaves, and Cane River left out a lot of slave things such as singing, praying, joking with their family, playing tricks on the old folks, etc. etc. etc. Cane River had people talking like white folks, and hardly ever getting angry, or hooting and hollering during celbrations. Even though I know this lady was black, she didn't write like it. I don't know what the big deal was. Read narratives like UP FROM SLAVERY or I WAS BORN A SLAVE or BULLWHIP DAYS. Or read good kids' books like THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO and THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JEREMIAH JONES!!!"
1,zzzzzzzzzz,usually a good book I can read in a day this one took me 2 months. Don't even bother with it.
4,Cool and Clever,"Impressive! It held my interest from beginning to end, and I liked that it didn't spoon-feed the viewer. The settings, angles, and lighting of shots greatly added to the suspense. The actors playing ""Billy"" and the ""Doctor"" gave very good performances. I can easily see how the film received Festival invites, nomination, and an award."
5,HOLY MOTHER,"[...]When it comes to THE NUGE you better strap yourself in. This is some of the stuff that I can't figure out why we don't hear more of it on the radio. Its insane, twisted, dirty.I get to hear this stuff every now and again, as I lost all my Nuge albums a long time ago. I WILL get them back, don't worry, they are coming up on my soon to be purchased again list.. I'm talking about this album, and the equally (if not better) rockin second album FREE FOR ALL.Every song on this disc rocks your house to the ground. Watch as the ladies start peeling off their clothes under the intense spell of face melters like STANGLEHOLD or STORMTROOPIN' or MOTOR CITY MADMAN.The Nuge is one strange cat, man. That fact is for sure. Very different. Listen to him wail on that god-damned guitar though, and whether you are into dirty sex lyrics or not... this stuff will blow your mind sky high!"
1,Laughably Bad 70's Music!!!,"This really is comedy-rock! Ted (or the Nuge, if you prefer)is a clown on guitar and his bands all the way back to the Amboy Dukes were some of the worst rock players around. If you're having a party and want those last 5 people to leave, throw this on!! A guaranteed room-clearer!!!!"
4,Ted Nugent (1975),"Ted Nugent's 1975 album for Epic records has become a hard rock classic. Featuring one of Nugent's best and best known songs ""Stranglehold"", this album rocks from start to finish. This is probably Ted Nugent's best album. Highlights include: Stranglehold, Just What the Doctor Ordered, Stormtroopin, Hey Baby and Snakeskin Cowboys. A must for your hard rock collection."
5,one smokin' cd,This is ted at his finest every song is good on here listen to his smokin' guitar work and you'll know why they call him the motorcity madman also check out the cool live stuff from 77
4,Old school Ted,What can I say. I remember this from way back. Ted is a wild man and I love this Album..
5,Ted Nugent still rocks in the millennium...,What can I say about Ted. He was great in the seventies and the eighties and I heard his records played almost daily by my brothers. Anyone who is into early generation hard rock needs this album. When you need something to make you feel a little younger just put on this album and your there.
2,Not very accurate,"I bought this particular calibration weight due to the positive reviews. The weight came in good condition with no scratches, but it does not weigh exactly 100g. Mine came out to 100.15g on a scale that is accurate."
4,Great buy,Item arrived in about a week. Looked just like the picture. The weight of the item is correct. worked great for me. I would recommend this item.
3,"Poor quality, but weight reasonably accurate.","The product I received was not what was pictured. The ""handle"" is a conical shape on the actual product and is mounted off center and slightly crooked. The weights (i bought two of them) are also scratched and dented, even though they were packaged OK. They weren't stamped with their weight, so don't expect a label.The weights measured 100.0g on a quality lab scale. If i get access to a more accurate scale, i'll re-evaluate these. For my home use, good enough.Only 3 stars, as these are quite ugly and just don't leave me with confidence in their quality. Since they're ridiculously cheap, i got what i paid for. Again, good enough for non-professional use, just expect poor quality in the looks department."
2,DOESN'T HAVE MUCH BITE!,"I waited a long time to buy this album. Had it in my hands a couple times when it first came out in the early seventies. Ishould have trusted my original instincts. I was really disappointed when listening to this recently available import-not much classic Cippolina-style guitar work (which is why Ipurchased it). For some reason I thought he was the centerpieceof the band? Somehow the banal lyrics and trite song arrangementsoverwhelmed whatever contribution Mr. Cippolina made to the band.My suggestion: just buy up all the Quicksilver Messenger Servicediscs while they're still available, then lament that John neverreally recorded any worthwhile stuff beyond that band."
4,Very informative,"This book manages to pretty much cover all the bases about rituals and such when you are expecting. I realied heavily on it for my first child and with the twins, I was somewhat disappointed to see it didn't mention a thing about multiple births (especially since they are so common nowadays 1-in 100). But other than that - I was highly impressed with the content!"
4,vinylicious vol 1 95 north,"If you like your house music with soulful vocals, slamin beats, and with a touch of old school! Then this is the cd for you. A truely uplifting vibe, and a classic in the makeing. Job well done....."
4,The best of the upbeat TD!,This is the best of their upbeat work. before this white eagle was my favorite upbeat album. this is them at their best. the only downside and the reason its rated 4 stars is that its live and you hear the crowd at the beginning and at the ends of the songs. the tracks are long and on tangent and barbakane i like to fast forward to the peak of the song around 10min12 secs on tangent is where it peaks into an upbeat rythmic bliss. on barbakane around 9min10secs is where it peaks into the best part of that song. the first and last tracks are long and good throughout. so are the other two but i like the peaks of the songs the best. this sounds like sequencer music like are you sequenced? and power of the moog by klaus shulze. if you like up beat td this is awsome definitly a good addition for a td fan.
1,Belle is better!,"Goodbye Blink 182, this is me, songs should be fun for everyone! Belle Perez is so much better!"
4,A refreshing approach,"Mike Bickle takes us back to the most important Commandment: Loving God. His review of Song of Songs is particularly interesting; through the imagery of how the groom is portrayed, we learn about the characteristics of God. From this, Bickle relates how knowing these characteristics can inspire our love for him.Bickle is not a great writer, but he is an insightful and refreshing writer. Bickle's message is, however, powerful: Christianity would be well served if we all aimed first to love God with all our heart, soul and mind.I think many church leaders from evangelical, mainstream and Roman Catholic churches today would be uncomfortable with this message. Yet like Mary and unlike Martha, we need to be at the feet of Jesus, bowing down, begging forgiveness and enjoying his presence. Correct doctrine, evangelism, social gospel, church activities are of secondary concern."
4,Wonderful Revelation of Enjoying God,"Wonderful. This book gives a new understanding of how God sees us. One of the greatest thoughts the book mentions is that, once we are born again, God delights in us even in our stumbling. Not that He approves, but He still delights in us (which is a deep bondage breaker). The book points toward having a relationship with God where He becomes our ""bridegroom"" and we can have a deep intimate relationship with Him in which we are WHOLLY delighted and TOTALLY satisfied (which kills temptation.) Some may say that being wholly satisfied and delighted in God is only an ideal, but I have a friend that recently has been experiencing a depth of God that I never imagined, and is presented in this book. The only reason I gave the book four stars is that I felt it could have been more in depth, and could have been a little more scholarly. Overall though, the message that is portrayed has given me a deep hunger for intimacy with Jesus."
4,Good performance from a Legendary rocker,"This album is from the former lead singer of Accept. It has a similar vibe to Accept, but not quite as good as the real thing. A few shining moments are there if your an Accept or UDO fan."
4,"Pounding Metal, Unique Voice","I have the cassette version of this album so I can't speak for any bonus tracks. I recently burned it to CD and have listened to it several times. One thing about UDO, he can't be mistaken for anyone else! With a voice that sounds like he swallows scrap metal and mellows it out with battery acid, there is just nobody like him.I saw him with Accept on their Balls To The Wall tour in the 80's in Spain and he almost didn't even need the PA. The guy's voice is powerful!This is the only solo album I have by Udo and it rocks pretty good. The music is not as memorable as I would like, but it is well played.Udo's voice is kind of like Lemmy, an acquired taste. If you get used to it, he can rock with the best of them. Highly recommended."
5,Storm Watchers,"John Cox is, and has always been, a phenomenal reporter and writer. This book deserves to be widely read. As a work of history, it is very much welcome -- a book that sheds light on the past of a subject which is, too often, shrouded in myth.-- Keay Davidson, Science Writer, San Francisco Chronicle"
5,Just wat I wanted.,Just like my old charger I lost. Looks new. Wat more can I say. OK works great. OKWorks great.
1,got the completely wrong charger,"Annoying. Waited a while to get both a battery and charger from this company to try and use an old cell phone for my father and finally received the package - the charger was entirely wrong and I had to just use a different phone. The kicker: couldn't return the battery once you buy it, even if it's still brand new and in the package! so that was a real pointless purchase all and all. they refunded me, but it was still annoying and I'm stuck with a battery I can't get a refund on. stupid."
5,Samsung OEM Travel Charger,"When I lost my original charger that came with my cell phone, I tried many generic substitues that I bought from Wal-mart. They did not work, quit working, or broke within a short period of time. This charger is as good as the original one. It works great. My cell phone holds its charge longer, and the charger is very durable. I would reccommend it to everyone."
5,ANOTHER FUN ANIME,"This is another great anime,the plot is much like other anime like save the world stop the bad guy.But this anime is very funny also to me.IT is another well done anime."
1,very disappointed,"The espresso set is supposed to be 4 oz. cups. Sadly, the cups are 3 oz., and that's filled to the brim. I was looking for 4 to 6 oz. cups for my espresso, and this set looked great with all the colors, however, it's not the stated 4 oz. (on the package), and that isn't what I ordered. This was a birthday present and gift wrap was payed for, but it wasn't gift wrapped so it was a bit emabarassing."
2,Tiny.. only 2 oz.,"I was looking for an espresso cup set that can hold 3-4 oz of coffee at the time. It is not possible to tell how large these cups are because the manufacturer does not state it anywhere. Other reviewers have been giving some guesses.. well, I measured it: 2 oz. You can put a tad more but then it goes to the rim and no way you can put sugar or a spoon to stir into it. So 2 oz max!!! Be sure you know that before you grow high expectations like I did. As it is, it is cute enough to keep and give coffee to guests but for me who prefers more coffee in my single shot espresso, I need to look for a 4-oz set! So why the 2 stars at all? the colors of te cups are cute. Why 2 stars max? Because there is no info about the size on the website! There should be!"
3,smaller in size than i had hoped,"These cups were nice for their bright color, but were much smaller than i had hoped. They are about half the size of a traditional coffee-cup - more like for an expresso."
3,I prefer porcelain and not ceramic...,"I ordered this as tea cups for my granddaughters when they come to my home. They look like ceramics, painted. Paint is uneven in places...some had nobbies, where they had not been sanded prior to painting. I like the size but would have preferred porcelain. I would not order these again."
5,Hilarious!,"Even though I didn't know who half these actors were, no matter. It's just as entertaining, witty and FULL of twists and turns. A very funny movie."
1,Dead Tired,"This movie might be good if you speak french and/or are hip to the french cinema scene. I didn't find it very funny, though it had its moments. I saw it based on a recommendation from having liked the dinner game. Totally different type of film."
5,GREAT,This is the best CD ever!! My whole family enjoys it. It is creative and imaginative. its a huge change from his other music and I love it.
5,Great Oversized Bag,"Purchased these bags to put away my 4 foot extra wide table top christmas tree. The size was excellent and enabled me leave all the ornaments on the tree, covering the base and securing at the top with a twisty tie. The thickness of the bag is great so it will keep out moisture and prevent bugs from getting inside. It is a see through yellow color which allows you to view what's stored inside. They come in many sizes to fit all your storage needs. Great bags!"
4,"Warp Brothers CB-40 Banana Bags Storage Bags, 40-Inches by 72-Inches...",Perfect bags for storage!I ordered these bags because I needed heavy storage bags.I would recommend these bags to everyone needing storage bags.
4,Great for long-Term storage!,"I bought these to store baby gadgets long-term. I scrub everything down, put it in the bag, and it's all ready to go if/when we have another baby. Great product!!!"
3,It's OK,"A good flashback to the olden days. I played the first song, and automatically started laughing. It IS wacky!"
4,access 2000 core with cd rom,This book give a thorough explanation from point to point. A must buy book that any access user canot afford to miss.
4,Great Coffee Table Book,"A great overview of firearms manufacturing companies and the weapons they make. Numerous international brands are listed, many that I have never heard of before; Feinwerkbau, Gaucher, Gamba, Moravia, Sarsilmaz, etc... All the common name companies are listed as well; Colt, S&W;, SIG, GLOCK, etc...The pictures are fantastic, the pages are glossy heavy stock and the descriptions are mostly error free. Each company listing starts with a short history that includes their location, company logo and a summary of the types of equipment they make.This is a quality coffee table book that is worth it's cover price. It's not a detailed book for experts, but a great overview of what's available in the market."
3,a good overall survey,"... but watch it on the details. Not all ""facts"" are correct. However the very huge number of firearms that have been complied, with a good photographic history of them, is well worth overlooking some of the ""specification"" mistakes."
5,informative,very informative if you are trying to expand your understanding of what is out there or in the market to buy a weapon.
3,"Too short, and not worth this rediculous price","Do not get me wrong, this is a very fun and interesting debate, but it is only 40 or so pages and so does not really give an adequate picture of Chesterton or Shaw. It is very helpful if you are looking into the political views of Chesterton or Shaw, but not much beyond that. I am unsure why it is so insanely expensive, so if you want to read it you should probably get it from a library like I did.Overall grade: C+"
2,Not a good picture of Chesterton's brilliant mind. Not a fun,I am a great fan of debate and this ain't a great one. There were some points in which it made me smile but overall this TINY little book is not particularly entertaining or informative. Save some effort here. The majority of the book (what there is of it) is spent discussing whether Shaw and Chesterton are socialsts. Two stars may be generous especially considering the price.
5,Wonderul Ceramic Curling Iron!,"Unlike the typical asian, I have really thick, hard-to-curl hair. Hot Tools is the only brand that makes curling irons that can curl my hair.I have very long, semi-dry at the ends, hair. This iron does not dry out my hair. Very easy to use.I recommend this iron highly for anyone wanting loose curls or a little more volume in their hair!"
4,A Fun Read,"I am bias in that i recently met the author. The series is well written with minor editing problems ie. a couple of misspelled words. I thought the imagination of the worlds created and the lead character development were fascinating. If you are looking for a good read, this book will expand your horizons."
5,Precise and Powerful,"My project was the replacement of the Pantry door in my kitchen. I had purchased a new custom door with a decorative glass insert. The only problem was that the new door was about three-sixteenths wider than the original door. Enter my need for a power planer - or at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it. This DeWalt planer is probably one of the most powerful and accurate tools in my woodworking arsenal. It allows for precise depth-of-cut adjustments. True, wood shavings fly all over the place, like Edward Scissorhands working on a hedge sculpture, but for me that was part of the joy of working on wood. I'm not sure how much use I will get from this tool, but whenever the need to plane arises, I'll be ready."
5,PLANER=AWESOME,"This tool is absolutely great. My brother feeling guilty for my miter saw (look at DW718 reviews) wanted to replace it. After I fixed it I told him all was well with the world but he felt he needed to make up for the reduction in value so he bought me this planer.I was amazed at how easy it was for an amature to use this tool. It is powerful, easy to use and makes smooth flush surfaces. I used it to plane the the top of a work bench I built for my shop. Simply put this tool is worth every penny that was spent. I was hesitant to get it but my brother insisted and so I highly recommend it. Another plus, the shavings make excellent mulch (depending on how the wood is treated) for you gardeners or lawn enthusiasts out there.In addition to the ease of use it is extremely easy to change the blades or conduct routine maintenance. DeWalt certainly made a winner with this product."
5,Hot flashes? Lydia Pinkham is the best!,"Having thought my doctor took me off of prescription HRT, I had hot flashes. Someone recommended Lydia Pinkham. I tried it and now I can't live without it. I highly recommend it."
3,No change,"I have not noticed any change in my menopause symptoms since I have been taking. I have had no ill side effects from this product, but will not buy again since it does not work for me."
1,Made me a nutcase!,"This stuff messed with my hormones so that my poor husband didn't know what to expect! We were trying for a girl, but SO not worth me crying alllll day every day!"
5,Love the Product!,Thank you amazon.com for having this product available and for the reduce price. This product really does work. Follow the instructions for the correct dosage and remember to take with a meal. Those hotPINKHAM TABS Size: 72flashes will really be under control!
5,Love love it~,"Fast delivery, the product in a very good condition! fully recommended!!It is help me feel better during my menstrual, never live with out it~"
3,"Beautifully Made, not the best selections","The theme music from Morse was my reason for buying this CD, and I was not disappointed. The CD gives the viewer the opening theme and the slightly longer closing theme (2:10 and 2:32, respectively).I wasn't overly impressed with the other musical selections on the CD. They certainly are representative of music from the Morse television series, but the pieces selected didn't show a wide variety. And the original music composed specifically for the series never reaches the same level as the Morse Theme.But the CD quality is excellent, and Morse fans who collect the music from the series won't be disappointed. This CD delivers what it promises."
2,Don't buy this game,"Don't buy this game. It makes no sense whatsoever, the graphics are awful, and it is too easy. I beat it in one hour! Gameplay is short, and it results in getting you stumped. What I said is....Why did I buy this game? I am not putting it up for sale because I don't want people to endure how painful this game is!"
3,In The Shadow Of The Great Blues Guitarists,"I have gone through the repertoire of blues great-John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Freddie King, Lightnin' Hopkins and so on in this space over the last period. I have not included the artists under review, Joe Louis Walker & His Bosstalkers and with reason. Although Joe Louis played with all of the above named artists of the electric blues pantheon he, off of this performance, does not belong there. On the second or third level, yes. No question that he is a virtuoso guitar player-behind someone else. Nothing wrong with that, right? Here in this 1991 concert the stick outs are ""I Didn't Know"", ""The Gift' and ""One Time Around"". Good solid blues but nothing to turn your head or stop what you are doing like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy or John Lee REQUIRE you to do."
3,A Essential Artist,"Any fan of acoustic music should have at least one CD of Cipolla's music. I first listened to him after hearing him referred to by David Grisman, and I was amazed that such great sounding stuff was around years before the ""new acoustic"" movement. This is maybe not the best collection of Rudy's music, but still great listening, and well worth the price."
2,Too Slow,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I liked the dance moves and the instructor well enough but you spend way too much time learning the moves and marching in place to get a halfway decent workout out of it. The music also got very monotonous, just having the drums. If you're just starting out exercising and like to dance than this might be a good workout for you, but for someone at an intermediate/advanced level, this will not get your heart rate up or make you sweat."
2,cracked out,"This was one of the craziest workouts I have tried. I am tired just thinking about it. That being said however, if you are a person who never finds a workout that is spastic enough then this is your DVD!"
5,Excellent,"I've taken Brazilian dance classes before and this video is as close to the real thing as you can get. It's a little long, but it's tons of fun fun and more challenging than her other samba videos. It is a great workout for those who love to dance and are pretty good at it. It has just the right amount of challenge with a lot of fun mixed in."
1,Brazilian Dance Workout,"After waiting excitedly for over six weeks for this video to be shipped to me, I found it nothing like it was portrayed to be. The so-called ""music"" had no rhythm whatsoever and was so annoying that I kept turning down the volume and then had to mute the sound. It was an hour of tediously repetitious and monotonous drums that were reminiscent of a bad head-hunter movie--with the needle stuck. I have listened to many percussion bands and they were lively and made you want to get up and move your body. This one just made me want to grit my teeth and end the torture. The workout was interesting, but much of it was just marching in place. My disappointment was extreme."
5,Dance a way the pounds!,"This workout is a must for those who want to lose weight and have fun. Dance away the pounds. It's great for the hips, waist, thighs and just burning calories. A must for everyone!"
2,It all depends on your coordination,"For me this video was easy to follow even though you are following the dancers who are facing you. The combination is given to you in pieces in four steps, first at full pace (you're supposed to watch), than at half pase several times which you can follow with, next at full pace, and then you combine all the sections. I love to dance and was looking for an outlet, this definately was not it. Doing the entire video without stopping at all does get your pulse up a bit, but not quite what I was hoping for. If you are not that coordinated and/or are not familiar at all with dance this video would probably be good for you"
1,save your money,"annoying!! the production is awful, with terrible camera angles and in some parts the sound doesnt match the video! And the music is just so irritating, the same bars over and over again for the entire boring length of her DVD.I honestly tired to get into it twice but I didn't get much of a workout at all, was hardly a drop of sweat to be seen! Not worth the price I would say..."
4,Brazilian Dance Workout,"I really enjoyed this workout. I do a lot of weight training and Tae Bo, so I wanted something a bit more feminine that would still work up a sweat. This was it! The dancers are regular people, the rhythm is contagious, and even though it takes doing it a few times to get the moves down, it's worth the effort. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it doesn't burn as many calories as Tae Bo, and I would like to find a dance-based workout that does. However, even if you're a beginner, this is a great cardio workout!"
1,Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac,The dances are not broken down enough for a novice and you don't get going enough to have a truly effective cardio workout.
3,Samba,"I thought there would be more samba moves that are more closely related to Carnival. It's a great video, but was just disappointed by that."
2,Disappointing.,"The dvd conveys energy and excitement, but this is not suited for beginners. Nor is it a great workout tape. Vanessa tries to break it down to easy to learn segments, and then build from there. However, I found it hard to follow and a lot of jumping around and marching in place. I hoped the dvd would focus on latin body movement that would add flavor to my dance repertoire but that is not the case. With all the breaks to focus on complicated sequences it's hard to work up a sweat so I didn't get a good workout. Further, with the jumping around I felt injury to ankles could easily happen. All in all, a disappointing purchase."
2,More explanation than workout,"I'm ok at following directions, but the complexity of the steps and the long explanations made this not so fun and impractical for learning to learn even short sections of the workout. Disappointing."
2,Not much of a workout,"This video was a disappointment. You'll burn a pithy amount of calories for the hour you've invested, and personally, I was bored. I didn't like how they previewed the combination before breaking down the moves, because you are relegated to standing there and watching. Based upon other reviews I have the minority opinion, but before buying please consider what kind of workout you are looking for. If you want a more active workout, this is not for you."
5,Brazilian Dance Workout,"I was searching for a fun way to do cardio and absolutely love this workout. It's a great blend of exercise and dance routines. It might take a couple of attempts to learn all the dance moves. However, once you do, the routine flows naturally. Plus, the music is infectious and upbeat. I highly recommend this video for anyone trying to find ""alternative"" methods of working out."
5,"Totally Awesome Dvd! Fun, fun, fun! Best dvd I've ever spent my money on!","Vanessa is great! This woman will have you sweating by the third dance that she introduces to you! Look, I'm not a dancer, nor did I excercise a lot, but since I've had this dvd in my possession, I've lost a total of 15 pounds. I am 5' 0, and I weighed a significant amount of weight for my height, but you better believe people will not know who I am come summertime, and that's all thanks to Vanessa Isaac and her wonderful dvd. Advice to all.....just take your time, learn the steps, eat healthy, get adequate rest, drink plenty of water, but most of all......KEEP THAT DVD PLAYING, EVERYDAY!!!!!"
5,This workout is exciting and motivating,"I have over 50 exercise Videos & DVD's and this one is the best! The great instructor & brazilian music (live band) are upbeat & really makes you want to move! Vannessa breaks down the moves so that they are learnable and then goes through them in a set together. Before I knew it I was able to dance, (even with my two left feet). It's also terrific because the participants in the video are normal everyday people. I would recommend this workout to people that want to be entertained and have fun while they work out. Also, this video worked muscles I didn't realize needed working out. I hope they make more videos like this."
5,Excellent !! Use dance as workout ...,"I Love dancing since I was a little. I was a bit worried at first, thinking that it would be like other aerobic exercise but uses latin music instead of regular aerobic music. But I was wrong ! It's so much fun and I don't feel like working out at all !! That's the point, because if your workout isn't fun, you'll get bored very quick."
4,Good workout!,I bought this video and I enjoy it! It is a little bit fast but fun. I also bought the Viva! Brazilian Rhythm Workout and that one has become my favorite one! They are different and yet they both have a fun feel to it.
4,Great British film/great British actors,"Based on a true story, this movie is both humorous and heart-warming. If you like British humor, yet have a soft spot for sentimental love stories, you will love this one."
5,A great book for anyone to share with friends.,"I was exposed to St. Ex in the ninth grade by my French teacher. He had us read the ""Little Prince"". My dream was to be a pilot and I could relate to the story. Going through college I read other books by St. Ex. and have been a fan ever since. I am a pilot and his writing touch the heart and soul of the reader. Both from physical experience and from spiritual wanderings.One could call this the essential guide to St. Ex. The selections cover his early years in the airmail service and through his patriotic devotion to duty and his countryman and the fall of France. These are real life adventures with true heros doing what they must for honor and duty serving a new need of mankind delivering the mail, and flying against the odds.Read it, it's about much more than the early adventure of flying the mail. It's sets one to contemplating as well."
3,Didn't have immediately useful info,"The other Guerrilla books give hundreds of immediately useful tips. Things you can go out and do tomorrow. Ways to sneak in the back door, or fly under the radar.Guerrilla Financing maybe should have chosen a different title, because it's more about traditional methods."
1,Way out of date,I bought this book to help with an internet startup. I was useless! VC has evolved and this book is way off target with respect to what VC is doing today. If you are interested in the internet do not waste you time here.
2,A dissapointing read,"This is a pretty basic and simplistic introduction to small business finance. Many of the ""tricks"" revealed in it for raising money simply will not work in the real world."
1,Have not received Guerrilla Financing,I sent a email to the book seller. I have not received a reply. I have not received my purchase.
1,Strong Feelings...BUT NO RESULTS!!,"I received my tape over two weeks ago. I'm execising 5 days a week (should be ONLY 3). Of course, my hips and buttocks feel stronger, I even fell some pain when i seat. But... i don't see any ?results?, like some reviewers keep saying. They say that the results are visible after even first time, but it's not, NOT AT ALL!! It's also hard to do! Actually, first time is OK, but when you do it second time - all your muscle are sooooo in pain, you can't even try to do 10 (supposed to be 100 counts). So, the choise is yours, but i'm not recomend!!"
2,Good Smelling Lip Balm,"I bought the mango lip balm, and it smells good, it's a bit waxy though and it doesn't stay on real long, I have to reapply alot."
2,"WELL, THE PRICE IS RIGHT","Sorry to say that all the balm must still be in Gilead because these lip balms neither soothed nor moistened.Yes, the tubes are pretty and they certainly are inexpensive. Mom always said, ""You get what you pay for."""
5,sof lips,This product is great it makes your lips really soft and has the appeal of added shimmer and slight color and would be perfect for someone who doesn't like to wear lipstick.
4,Buy a handfull of these.,"Keep an Avon Naturals Lip Balm in your coat pockets, purses, desk drawer, etc. The price is obviously right, and the product is soothing enough to handle that irritating dry feeling BEFORE it turns into really damaged chapped lips. Use them every day -- prevention is the key!"
5,Underrated Algerian Bluesman.,"Beautifully recorded CD from a very underrated French-Algerian bluesman who has spent alot of time in legendary American blues bands. He backed James Cotton for some time and his three CDs that are in circulation are a blend of Middle Eastern/African rhythms, sung in French, and with the addition of some seriously good blues guitar.Amar Sundy plays blues guitar like Peter Green and with a hint of Albert King & Buddy Guy.If you purchase this one then also try and track down his very first sensational CD called "" ""Hoga Paris-Chicago"". This one is dynamite!"
2,Get a canister filter,"The idea is good--use a finer filter to remove the more dangerous dust. The problem is that these bag filters are not very efficient. You need two bag filters or a bag filter and a plastic collection bag to make it work effectively. If you are going to bother upgrading your dust collector, it makes more sense to buy a good canister filter and mount it on the dust collector. (You can find one example by searching ""9e300bl conversion"" on the web. Alternatively look for canister dust filter.)"
2,wire harnes kit,"I found this difficult at best to work with. The kit did NOT fit my car and the selection for the kit was not clear about the year and model the kit was suited for. I wound up getting a kit from a store that told me what color wire to connect with the wires in my car. Once I figured that out, I cut off the connections from the kit and wired it (using my clips) to the car. HUGE difference from the wagon to the sedan - Manufacturer needs to be more precise in the distinction!"
4,"A good novel, but not equal to her previous novels","After reading ""Nell,"" I glommed all of Jeanette Baker's previous novels. I'm not a big fan of paranormal romances, but Baker's writing made me a big fan of hers. Consequently, I was excited to read Baker's first true contemporary. Unfortunately, I didn't find this book up to her normal standards. The big flaw rests in the almost nonexistent interaction between the hero and heroine in the first part of the book. Instead of developing the romance, Baker concentrates on Caitlin's relationshiop with her children. Although this was interesting, it got to be a bit much. However, if you hang in there, the action picks up and the book improves. I particularly liked the characters -- nobody is perfect, nor is anyone truly evil. Although this book isn't a 5 star read, I'll again be anticipating Baker's next book."
1,Bardolatry Bedevils Bloom,"There are so many good treatements of HAMLET. This is not one of them. It's bad on almost all counts: scholarship, unworkable thesis, far too much quoting from primary source with too little analysis. It's a silly little book. But worst of all is the oppressive idolizing of Shakespeare that Bloom parades with glee throughout the book. Far from being a viable point of view, to say nothing of the fact that it's so treadworn as to be a cliche nowadays, Bardolatry is an obstacle to meaningful criticism. Bloom should know better."
4,Epic and trance-inducing.,"Think My Dying Bride merged with Tangerine Dream and you may begin to get an idea of what this CD sounds like. It has the brutal moodiness of MDB mixed with the ambience of TD. But this album is half-and-half. The first half is Progressive Doom Metal and it stays that way for a while, but it gradually and fluidly changes pace into a more atmospheric, gothic texture. This album really doesn't seem all that long to me, being a loyal fan of MDB, but it is nearly 70 minutes of music and texture and could seem lengthy to some. I did enjoy the CD, but I wish they had stayed with the more aggressive songwriting of the earlier tracks. But that being a matter of taste, this CD is worth owning for all interested in Doom Metal or gothic songwriting. There is a lot of both styles to be found here. Later."
3,NickyWicky1542,"We Fought Like Demons is a very informative book on women soldiers in the Civil War. The book discusses the different identities women took and what roles they played in their troops. Some were detectives, some were nurses, some were spys, and some were even brought up to the role as lieutenant. DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook do a good job on going into great detail with each individual woman soldier. I enjoyed it and I think other readers will too."
5,Significant Book on Women in Civil War,"This is a significant book on women in the Civil War. Although based on scholarly research, it is a good read and full of information. It doesn't try to cover ALL women in the Civil War. The concentration is mostly on women in combat roles. It is unlike the many books on female spies, which are often based on legends, some created several years after the war to sell magazines. And, you don't have to be a Civil War scholar to enjoy this book. Book purchased from Amazon. I have no connection to or acquaintance with the authors."
4,Sister against Sister?????,"Blanton and Cook's book about women soldiers serving in both the Northern and Southern Armies is entertaining. But be forwarned, it does have a halting style of writing. It drags in places and flies in others.Well researched, the book does advance the topic of women serving as men during the civil war. And it does cover a few battles. However, if you're looking for light reading or looking for a general book on the civil war, then you need to keep looking.As I worked my way through the book I did keep pondering the question of sister fighting sister, or mother fighting mother. We certainly make much of the brother against brother of son against father aspects of this conflict. I wonder how many woment really did fight during the civil war in both armies? I don't know that we'll ever know that answer, but not because Blanton and Cook didn't try to find out."
3,They Fought,"This book was a hard read. I just couldn't wait to be done with it. The book would bring up women numerous times in different chapters but never clearly told any woman's story at once. All I really walked away with was ""There were women fighting in the Civil War."" Exactly the same thing I learned from the cover. The pictures are exellent though. It would have been nice to have more of them, but I guess there aren't a lot of them surviving. It's interesting, I just wish things weren't repeated so much and that there was a little more information."
2,slightly biased,"this was an interesting book, but it does not contain hardly any information on women from the south. there are some opinions expressed that show the authors are biased toward the union. so if you are searching for information pertaining to the Confederate women, don't read this book."
2,They fought like Demons,I bought this book for my mother as she really likes to read about women in history. When I recieved it I thumbed through it and found it to read more like a text book and not something one would choose for an afernoon of pleasure reading.
3,Not very impressive,The net output is very low. You need to put the gain at very high to get decent volume output. Lot of echo and noise comes with it.
2,it sucks,Worked great for two months and then just died for no reason. Other than being used. Now it a paper weight now and every now and then. I'll try hooking it up and hope that it starts working again.;( I have a lot better mixer now. You get what you pay for. Sorry folks I got this mixer about 3 years ago. Just started writing now. They may have fixed the power problem now.
5,Rare detail of the horror of War.,"This book takes you from a battlefield search for a father. The trenches of World War 1 France,to the same battlefield with the son now in the same trenches. Written thru the eyes of the young man as he sees it: and how his mind processes the horror it sees. This is a masterpiece,for its brutal truth of the simple horrors of war. The blood, the barren waste,the lost dog,and the lost and angry men. Why are the politicians not here,he asks.And even now thru war one still wonders. This book cuts no slake and does not make war noble or great..It is horror written from the minds eye of the Hero."

5,"fun, informative and important!","All of this dvd had something important to offer husbands, boyfriends and significant others. It made a difference for my husband and myself and he said he wished that it had been available for his father back when his mom was experiencing menopause. All through it I kept saying ""see! see! that's me!!"" and it gave him a great new perspective with no man bashing. The couple therapy section was terrific and all the skits were paced so as not to make it all too serious. The doctor, Tori Hudson, was SO informative. The whole thing gave us hope we might survive the next fun menopausal years and helped him so much. Which, obviously, helps me. And the handbook's great for reinforcing the info and having something handy to refer too."
4,How to Listen to Your Teen,"The title of the book is a grabber for most parents who think their child is defiant, manipulative or out-of-control. Many parents at this stage are feeling a little bit desperate, or a lot. They'll read anything that offers them hope and a way out of conflict.I read it because I wanted to find out if I could recommend it to parents, and I can. Tough love doesn't work. Trust and deep listening does. Each acting out, the author shows, is a cry for help and this book throws you BOTH a lifeline.Alexia Parks, [...] author of An American Gulag, Secret P.O.W. Camps for Teens."
5,"An enthusiastically recommended, highly original novel","Set against the background of the 1939 New York World's Fair, Miles Beller's Dream Of Venus follows the adventures of Zeke Lichtenquist (an artist recently moved into the fair's ""Town of Tomorrow""). This is a small and interwoven world of science and strippers, tourist dollars and visions of a better future, even as the world was sliding inexorably into a world of war. Dream Of Venus is an enthusiastically recommended, highly original novel that grips the reader's imagination and attention from the very first page and won't let go until the last line of the last paragraph of the last chapter."
3,Impressions right -- expressions wrong.,"Reading DREAM OF VENUS brought me back to the days when the expressions ""that blows"" and ""to die for"" came into popular currency. Unfortunately, that period was the 1980s, not the '30s. The inclusion of these and other anachronistic figures of speech is sloppy. And ""youse"" is second-person plural, not singular, Brooklynese!"
2,careless research,"The scope of this book is commendable. Photographs and graphics are of high quality. But the many errors that I recognize make me wary of the rest of the information in the text. Examples: Michael Graves, in his introduction, refers to the street fronting the campus as McMicken Street rather than Clifton Avenue; the most recent additon/enclosure of the Law School is attributed to the wrong architect; President Steger is mistakenly credited with initiating the idea to commission the campus master plan, when the credit should go to Dean Jay Chatterjee. If the publishers plan a second edition, they should see that their writer gets his facts right."
4,"Flawed perhaps, but still excellent","Taking into account the comments of the above reviewer, this is still a wonderful book. I have a copy and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It has excellent colour 3D maps and colour photos, with a couple of pages of text for each building. A good read if you are interested in architecture, particularly modern."
3,Already outdated....needs new edition,This is a campus that was in the middle of the master plan construction and many things have been finished or changed since the book came out. It is an excellent reference but you will be thoroughly confused using it as a guidebook. I would recommend waiting for an updated edition and I will purchase it as soon as it comes out!
3,Somebody PLEASE make a professional video/audio recording of this band!!!!!,Oh my GAWD!!!! This is a phenominal band. I had the great fortune of seeing them several times in the 80's. This lineup is one of the best. I hate to admit that this recording is very sub-par for this band. It would be a complete crime to let this generation of fantastic musicians go by with out a good recording.Generally you can hear Steve Morse. And thank gawd T. Lavitz is fairly prominent. But the fact that Jerry Goodman is in the background most of the time is an absolute CRIME!!This is worth the money. I'm just upset that no one has produced a first-class recording of this band.
2,I would've given it a 3 but...,"I like rock. This is not rock. This is jazz fusion. The mix from the board sucked hard. I played it in DTS 5.1, and it was still bad. Steve Morse is on the left channel. The violin is on the right channel. When they play dual leads, the violin buries the guitar. Plus, violin is not rock. When Steve plays lead alone, the rhythm violin buries his lead. The acoustic section is not lead guitar. It's all rhythm music, and gets boring quickly. All in all, very hard to listen to eclectic music. The bassist (Dave LaRue) is the best player in the group period. I saw him play at G3, and he was better than Dream Theater's guitarist (John Petrucci) too. The drummer (Rod Morgenstein of Winger) is the 2nd best player. Steve Morse to me wasn't as good as his band, but with the horrible sound quality, it's hard to be sure.If you buy this, don't buy it to be awed by guitar like with Satriani or Vai, buy it to hear the rhythm section. But still, none of it rocks."
4,A must have for all Steve Morse Fans,"This brings back memories. The Dixie Dregs is one of the all time greatest artist to come out of the south. And Steve Morse sounds a good as ever. I'll have to admit the Video and audio could be improved on, but if your a Dregs fan the thrill will out way the imperfections. The band doesn't miss a lick. I remember seeing the Dregs perform these tune when they were first released and its like being there all over again. Sure Allen Sloan, and Andy West are not part of the band for this DVD. But Jerry Goodman and Dave LaRue fill in those shoes nicely. If you were a Dixie Dregs fan in the past or a Steve Morse fan now. You can't pass this up. It is awesome, as you would expect."
2,Cheap I guess,"... bought it because it was such a good price, however there is a reason it is so marked-down; the tracks are cheap. The music is mainly drum beats, the same ones over and over. I expected lively interesting music, but there are so few instruments and all the tracks end up sounding similar, the CD was a disappointment. The drum beats are decent, just predictable and boring. There are much better CDs for bellydance music out there."
3,Belly Dance Instrumentals,"I was disappointed that there was no new Emad Sayyeh music on this CD. all ot the instrumentals of his on this CD are found on his other CD's, (nothing new) The music by Calif Hassan is nice, because of this the CD was worth the price. Jaleena, director of Desert Heat Dancers."
2,"it's OK, nothing special","I expected more, too sweet to me and seams a bit old by smell. I guess this is an issue when you buy online, you are not sure how old the product is :-(. Lots of people told me about it."
2,Not for continous use,There are other headsets with more flexible headband and more comfortable design at this price. I didnt notice any difference between the boom mic and a normal one considering the recording quality.
1,Mistakes from 1815-1823,"This book has mistakes. It means to describe the uniforms from the Dutch-Belgian troops during the Napoleontic Wars. In the Dutch case that is Quatre-Bras and Waterloo (1815). But the uniforms described in this book are the ones depicted in Teupkens 1823 book on Dutch uniforms. Therefore the descriptions are about 8 years too late. Between 1815 and 1823 there were over 200 changes in Dutch uniforms and the authors don't take these changes into account. There might be some correct uniforms described in the book, but I researched the engineers uniform and that is wrong."
2,1815-1823 mistakes,"This book has mistakes. It means to describe the uniforms during the Napoleontic Wars, i.e. in the Dutch-Belgian case Quatre-Bras and Waterloo. But in fact its uniforms are based on the ones described in a 1823 Dutch book by Teupken. Therefore the information is about 8 years too late. Between 1815 and 1823 there were over 200 uniform changes for the Dutch soldiers and officers. The book might be OK for some uniforms but keep this in mind. I have studied the engineers uniform and it WRONG in this book."
1,I wish there were zero stars,"Total disappointment. You can listen to this entire CD for free on top 40 radio, or on MTV. With the exception of Radiohead, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and Fastball, whose contributions are interesting, original, and jump with well coordinated instrumental stylings and good lyrics, there are few standouts on this trite and bland CD."
2,Now that's what I call commercial garbage!,"Maybe half of these songs are still remembered today. Another half of that half is garbage songs. How many people can honestly say they can still enjoy listening to this today? ""NOW"" compelations are the perfect example of how whats popular today may not be popular tommorow. Hell some of these songs weren't even good back when this was released. My advice, stear clear of this, future NOW compilations, and any other commercial mix cd's."
4,A preatty good CD.,This cd is pretty good. It has some songs I like and some I don't but it is pretty good altogather. The best songs are buy the BSB's and Brit S. But don't lisen to me if you don't want to because some people have different tastes in music. But this has a little bit of everything. I hope this review helped.
3,Review for now thats what i call music vol.1,"I think this is a realy great cd but if you think this is good you should ceck out now thats what i call music vol.3 it has all the latest artists like Limp Bizkit(nookie),smash mouth(all star), Blink 182(whats my age again),and Lenny Kravitz(american women."
3,Now! 1 Gets Things Started,"This Now! 1 album started a string of hits albums thats have become important albums and all 5 albums have landed in the top 10, but like Now! 3, Now!1 just loses something, maybe because there is not enough good material on it, this album does deserve 4 stars for having Janet(Together Again)-great song, and BackStreet Boys(As Long As You Love Me), and Fastball(The Way), just to name a few but those three song just can't stand with some of the other songs that are on here like ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua, ""Shorty"" by Imajin a song I had never even heard of much less know who the artists' is, then there is the ever annoying ""Zoot Suit Riot"" by Cherry Poppin' Daddies who had one hit wonder written all over them, and finally Tonic's ever irritating ""If You Could Only See"" a song to this day I can't stand, Now! 1 is in no comparisons to Now! 4 and 5, where those album here enough good songs to over come the bad, and Now! 6 is ready for release and that album looks very promising."
3,Not What I Would Call Music,"The subtitle used to market this CD is at best viewed with a certain sense of sarcasam. The NOW series is a take-off from its European counterpart save for being aimed at a slightly younger crowd. This album would have easily received 5 stars had it contained a more diverse, and obviously better-represented selection. While this album does contain a few diamonds in the rough by such notable performers as Fastball, Lenny Kravitz, and K-Ci and JoJo, the artists on this album are predominately fly-by-nights (Harvey Danger, anyone?). Good for a bubblegum/pop-esque romp, but might be overlooked by the more mature listener."
3,Whatever!,"-k- like I won't even listen to this cd because can you say lame songs? Scince when was Hanson ever cool? Sorry but there's only like five songs on the whole cd that are o.k. I wouldn't buy it even if it were like 8 bucks. You'd have to give it to me to add that cd to my collection. I'd give it a 2 and a half, maybe a 3."
1,"Now that's what I wouldn't necessarily call ""music""....","The reason I'm saying this is that there are mostly teen artists on this, one of many in this series. If that's what you'd call ""music,"" fine, then. There's plenty more out there than this. Sorry, but that's my personal opinion. The whole thing is crazy because often adult artists like Phil Collins and Andrea Bocelli can't get on here. Ridiculous."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME CD!!,"This CD is great! I never heard about it until my friend got it and told me how cool it was,she told me all the artists and songs on it and it sounded like a great addition to my collection of cd's. I got it and I listen to it all the time! It has a great assortment of songs and is great to have for a party. Some of my favorite singles of songs are on here that I never got to get the artists cd of. I'm so glad I got this! It was definatly worth my cash!"
4,Surprizingly good collection,TV ads did not do justice to the breadth of songs on this cd. I was disappointed that the Harvey Danger song was edited slightly. The audio on the profanity was muted. This may make the recording more tolerable for sensitive listeners but the song is different from the radio air-play.
1,Disappointed,"There was only one disc, with one movie on the disc. Crime Spree. The Product description says 2 discs. The description says English, But it opens in French with no subtitles, it also happens a couple of times during the movie, so unless you can understand french, this movie may not be for you, it certainly was not for me. Amazon sent me a second movie, same problem. They finally refunded my money."
3,Bartolucci's Living Large... is better - don't bother with this,"This book is not nearly good as Bartolucci's Living Large....I think a designer and photo stylist were dispatched to each home to spiff everything up, bring in set furniture and props, to idealize each of these homes. They all look the same after a while, though they are supposed to be real homes in many different countries.A total lack of true human quirkiness, individuality, humanity, toiletries, book and figurine and art collections.... That is the problem. The small apartment dweller's solution should not be, hire a designer, and have your home look like a Crate and Barrel catalog page. These homes have been too cleaned up and homogenized.The book does not answer, how to live realistically in a tiny home. Bartolucci's book does.I was disappointed."
3,"fine, if your place is small AND...","This is a great book- for Europeans or the all too rare odd American space. I bought it for ideas for my 700 s.f. place. Which is totally normally laid out (frontroom, sunroom, dining area, kitchen, bath all on one peid-a-terre level...) these are a bit ""what to do when you have 498 SF and a ceiling that will accomodate a loft over the kitchen for which you need a mobile wall that cuts off the libary""-- if you are looking for a book to help out with figuring out how to make your old pensioners apartment not look like your first piano teachers apartment-- this isn't the book."
5,"big ideas, small spaces","a lot of ideas, nice professional photography, interesting international examples"
4,quality beef jerky!,"My kids didn't know if they would like this hickory variety of Oberto beef jerky, but they are sure glad they tried it! It is as good as the original variety but with more of a sweet, smoky flavor. These size of bags are perfect for snacking and for keeping your kids from eating a whole big bag! The only improvement I would suggest is for the pieces of jerky to be larger."
4,treasury of the west,"not a bad double cd, some excellent songs some newer versions all in all a good easy listening cd for people who like country and western"
4,Good Electric Jazz,"This guy can sure play guitar and this trio with Vic Stevens on drums and Chico Huff on bass is tight. Excellent keyboards on a couple tracks and awesome guitar throughout. ""Skwerbie"" includes some great keyboard work and is a classic fusion tune. ""Industrial Blowout"" and ""Ong's Hat"" remind me a little of classic Tony Williams Lifetime. ""Marcella"" is an acoustic guitar piece and quite well played.I would compare him in style to Alan Holdsworth or Scott Henderson. Mostly tight jazz guitar trio, but they can and do rock out a couple of good fusion tunes as well. There is just something missing here from making it a great album, but it sure is a good one. I give it a light 4 stars."
5,No more crumbs,"I love this bread cutting box. If you love having French or Italian bread, you've got to have this item. It keeps you counter clear of crumbs because they all fall into the box for easy emptying."
5,wow!!!,i was so excited to get this. i've followed joey and co. since something better change andthese videos (sermons to) are what its all about . i didn't even know they existeda visual treat i wish i could give it a 10 aahh hell I DO!keep true joey and just dowhat you do don't change
2,Good Concept - Poor Execution,"As many migraine sufferers will tell you - ice packs work wonders. Which is why I loved the idea of this pillow... but the design wasn't perfected.The Basics:- Pillow is too small, doesn't sit well around my neck- Pillow is too firm, causes an aching neck- Ice pack is smaller than expected, does not reach full extent of migraines behind earsIn the end, save your money and keep using your ice packs withEagle Creek Travel Gear Comfort Travel Pillow!"
1,not original quality?,"I replaced 3 of the 4 mounts on my 1994 Camry with Anchor mounts. The vibration was only slightly better, but I thought I had eliminated the mounts as the problem, so I spent more time and money checking other possiblities. Finally I took it to a auto shop, and they said that you have to use original mounts on this vechile, and sure enough the vibration is gone. The only problem is original mounts cost more than 4 times more. I am disappointed in the time and money lost, but happy that the problem is finally fixed. I am not sure if one or all of the after market mounts contributed to the problem."
5,A well-made accessory for Lowel i-Light,"This diffuser adds a valuable additional level of light control to the Lowel i-Light. It has a hinged attachment so that when it is fastened to a barn-door frame, you can swing it open if you want sharper more direct light, or close it over the lens for diffusion. It clicks securely to the barn-door frame when closed so that it will not fly open if you tilt or move the light."
4,takes me back,"I used to listen to this 25 years ago. His orchestral music is better, but scarce to find on cd. Try Stars End, quite beautiful in places and orchestral music very much of the early 80's."
5,a delightful and critical read,"Rather than being merely celebratory, this book offers a nuanced - yet very accessible - feminist analysis of Wonder Woman. Framed as both a historical and contemporary icon, the Amazon princess represents many of the promises and limitations associated with strong and sexy female bodies in mass culture. Robinson's text demonstrates how Wonder Woman both mirrors and departs from ancient myths featuring powerful amazons and goddesses. The author shows us how such extraordinary female figures continue to haunt contemporary culture in different forms.This book shows us how an analysis of comic book heroines (Wonder Woman, She-Hulk, Invisible Woman, and Elektra, for example) can contribute to ongoing discussions of women's (and girl's) ""place"" in our society, and is relevant to contemporary gender issues.This makes Wonder Women not just a fun read, but a smart, witty, lively and engaging MUST-read."
1,Aspires to be Trina Robbins,"At 150 pages, the book is still about 100 pages too long. One gets the feeling she is jealous of Trina Robbins (The Great Women Superheroes) and wants to write a book on comics just to show that if Trina can she can too. This is evident in that she keeps bringing up the other author to slam her.Further,the author admits to the weakness of her thesis, in that there are many examples of prefiminist comics and of postfeminist comics but that the transition between the two mindsets is not documented within the comics. So the book documents the endpoints but says nothing about the journey."
3,Fascinating true life experiences of people in Alaska.,"It brings real people, times, places, and adventures to life in a way that one can feel and share. A closeness with love for nature and animals, and warmth in the coldest deep freeze.It was history in the making, the beginning of an era, with respect for one another, machines, animals and nature."
1,Dense,"This is the required textbook for the Contemporary Native American Art History course at SIUC. However this book doesn't really have anything to do with Native American artists, instead it is more of an anthropological approach to the art world which makes the art history course a little confusing at times.I never got this book when I ordered it, supposedly it got lost in the mail. I got my money back but I think that is the last time I order from Beedees books. I had to read the copy they had on reserve at the library here during my breaks. The material is extremely dry and it was really hard to concentrate on a certain topic."
5,A very good roots album,"There is nothing new under the sun, but the fans of IV dont mind at all, I think. The sound is as always very solid and classic. In my opinion this album isn't their best but it's definitely worth buying. If you like the 'Free to move'album you will like this one as well."
3,What Ever Happened to Class?,"It went to Marcia Lewis. Marcia is a true leading lady of the stage and cabaret world. She brings a whole new energy to the song ""Nowadays"". And her ""So What"" is far superior to anyone elses. If you enjoyed her in Chicago, Grease, or Fiddler on the Roof , you'll enjoy this cd. And if you're in the NY area, she'll be more than happy to autograph it for you if you bring it to her at the schubert theater stage door, where she performs Mama eight times a week"
2,Not what I hoped for . . .,"I heard a most excellent track from Shadows on a Dime on the radio a while back and decided I must have it.I found Impressionistic and, at the time, thought that the track Shadows on a Dime was also the track I was looking for so bought it. Nope. The tack I was looking for was ""it won't take long"", off that album but NOT on impressionistic. Anyway, am not impressed with this compilation. Not only does it not contain the most axcellent track I was looking for but is moslty not to my liking. A lot of material with about three good tracks, a lot of mediocre, and some [...]"
3,Euge,I'm satisfied with the transaction and the product received. On time and in excellent conditions.I will certainly keep buying from here.
5,Reader-friendly text,"I thought that this book was absolutely wonderful. I bought a similar book on the same topic, but it was lacking information, so I went to the library and stumbled upon this goldmind. It's full of useful information, and it really is step by step--just what I need since I'm self-publishing my own book. I only regret that the publisher is out of stock because this is the book I'd like to own. Kavka and Heise have done a wonderful, informative job."
5,"Excellent, Encouraging book","This is the 2nd book by Linda Dillow I have read. I like reading just a chapter a day and using it as part of my devotional. I really appreciate her encouragement. Unlike many other books where you feel sometimes as if you can never live up to the ideal set forth, this one offers encouragement and stories that help inspire you to keep up the good fight and examine your heart and mind to improve your relationship with God and become that inspiring woman God made you to be. If you want to change, grow AND be encouraged, then I highly recommend this book."
5,Excellent book,"I used this book to teach a marriage seminar at a recent women's retreat. It provided a solid foundation to base the seminar on. It is filled with good, practical, biblical information. The response from the women was overwhelming. We all went home encouraged and anxious to be the best wives and mothers we can be."
5,SIGNIFICANT BOOK,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK. I HAVE TAUGHT WOMEN'S BOOK STUDIES FROM THIS BOOK FOR YEARS AND IT IS ALWAYS A SIGNIFICANT LIFE CHANGING BOOK, THAT IS WELL WRITTEN, DIRECT AND LEADS THE READER TO EVALUATE WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR LIFE IN REGARDS TO THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE IN CHANGES IF DESIRED. I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT INSPIRING TO ME PERSONALLY."
2,fell apart in the weather,not made to be outside. The weather destroyed it after about 2 months 5 stars if you keep it indoors
2,Other Kufis?,"i ordered two Kufis (1 white - 1 black) last year and have yet to wear them because the brim is short and does not cover enough of my head. if the brim were 1 or 1 1/2 inches longer, in my opinion, it would be a much better looking hat on ones head. also, are there other colors or designs available with the size stated?? the kufis i received are too large and have to be made smaller to fit. i wear kufis exclusively that fit size 23 inches and want to see others..."
3,Rubbermaid Can Do Better,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
4,Cute and Enjoyable for 7-9 yr. olds,My son has enjoyed this game even though usually he's only interested in big name character games. It has held his attention though some parts of it he has said were difficult as it doesn't always explain well what is expected to get through certain areas of the game.
2,I was expecting Jack Bauer to pop out any minute,"Lou Diamond Phillips (La Bamba, The Big Hit) stars in this forgettable thriller about Detective Jack Lucas who is on a case of a killer. The killer Oliver Chadwicke played by the awesome Edoardo Ballerini (Dinner Rush, The Pest) is also obsessed over a stripper named Jessica played by the miscast but still beautiful Kari Wuhrer (Sliders, General Hospital). Oliver also is very smart but has a shaky past. Jack figures out that the killer might be setting him up to make it look like he is the killer. He finds out who he is and his history etc etc. Nothing much here except a very sexy looking Kari Wuhrer. Formulaic plot involving Cop vs. Bad Guy and the Bad Guy is tryin to fram the Cop. Phillips & Ballerini are the only two that hold the film together. Also starring Gwen McGee (Coach Carter, Mercury Rising), Jack McGee (Breakdown, Rescue Me), Iva Hasperger (Exorcism, Vlad) and Carmen Argenziano (Starate SG-1, Identity)"
4,Predictor of greatness.,"In this early Travis McGee Mystery the bad guy comes out of nowhere and the plot is somewhat familiar, but it shows the word magic that would make John D MacDonald one of the greatest."
4,Entertaining Mystery,"Travis McGee does it again, with attitude. These books are loads of fun and this one is no exception. I had it sort of figured out pretty early on, but enjoyed watching the whole thing unfold. These books are so funny with their 1960s male perspective, and I love the little details that MacDonald includes. Suspenseful, funny and a good read."
5,Book review for Trav,Good read in the Travis McGee series that I started 30 years ago when they first came out at the book stores.
4,Early McGee,"'A Purple Place for Dying' is the third of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series. In this one McGee is out of his familiar haunts of the Florida coast and has traveled to the dry, rocky American Southwest to help a woman who wants to divorce her husband and needs some dirt dug up on him (she suspects him of embezzling her trust fund, as well a some other shady deals). McGee is not inclined to take the job, when a unseen gunman kills her. Although McGee now has no client and could return to Florida, he's not the kind of guy to let someone get killed in front of him without doing something about it.John D. MacDonald is an excellent writer, no other writer I have read can transmit the sense of menace and fear that he can. His dialogue is very sharp and his characterization is excellent. One of my favourite series."
4,Good Ol' Book,"For someone who goes through mysteries like water, this was a refreshing trip back in time. Remeniscent of the good old days when a private eye had to talk to people to figure out the mystery, no help from finger prints and DNA. Very well written, a must if you prefer PI mysteries to forensic science mysteries."
5,Best circular saw I've ever used,"Really powerful and smooth saw, good stability. The saw's base is wide and of high quality. Easy to adjust. I prefer the blade on left for good visibility on long rips, although you might get a bit more dust in your face that way."
4,It really cuts,"well. The saw is powerful, and fairly lightweight. Not jumpy either, very smooth. The case is clown-shoes big and the adjustable handle is a bit stiff, but overall a worthwhile investment and a good deal at that. (this review is for ""left blade"" consumers only. I cannot speak for the other side.)And I am over the age of 13. Really."
5,Great saw,"I'll state up-front that this is the only high-end circular saw that I've used to any degree but I don't see how any saw could top this one. I bought this saw, after much research, to replace a crummy old Skil saw I had. I gave consideration to the Porter Cable and DeWalt saws too, but this one seemed to stand out in my book - and in many of the reviews I read. I do wish it had the dust collection features of the PC though and a blade brake for added safety.At the same time I purchased this saw, I also bought a Freud Diablo blade and put on it. I have used this combination to build a variety of ww'ing type projects and this saw had performed flawlessly. The saw has ample power, is well-built, and handles very easily.I'm sure whatever your circular saw needs are, this saw is up to the task. Definately recommended."
2,Cheap,"Read all the reviews here and decided to give it a try. The saw I previously used was a 20 years old SKIL saw. Let me tell you,this saw doesn't hold a handle to the old SKIL. It sounds like any other cheap saw from Harbor Freight (kind of rocks instead of bearings feeling). Besides, a pretty strong vibration would come and go while you are cutting. I don't know what I'm going to choose next, one thing I know for sure, I'm not going to keep this saw. The hight adjustment leaver got jammed and it took all my strength to loosen it. Bottom line, it would be a good $30 saw, not a $130 one."
4,Almost Perfect,"Bought this to place a heavy worm drive saw for cabinet making. This is a really nice saw except for the base plate. It is made of aluminum and has raw edges on the sides that are not machined very well. Not a problem unless you use a saw guide like I do. I actually sent back the first one as the base plate had such rough edges that it would not follow the saw guide well at all. If they would just use one of thier new composite base plates with the turned up sides, this saw would be great! Hint, hint."
3,2 out of 3 ain't bad,"Well, my worst fear of a multi-disc certainly came true. Retrograde is missing from the set. It's advertised as being on one side of one disc, but, we get the same flick on both sides. Too bad, as I wanted Retrograde. Despite that, Direct Contact was good, especially the eye candy of actress Polly Shannon. Even Dolph wasn't his usual wooden personality. However, the overall problem is ""once bitten, twice shy."" I've always feared issues with multi-disc sets, now that there is a problem with one, I seriously doubt I will ever buy another."
1,There is a flaw at the manufacturer,"Advertised and packaged as 3 movies, there are, in fact, only 2 different movies on the discs. Direct Action was on both sides of the first disc, where side B reads Retrograde. Amazon replaced it once, with the same results. I guess I'll have to buy Retrograde separately. The movies included were enjoyable, but I was hoping to see Retrograde."
2,"WHERE'S ""RETROGRADE""???","I see ""Direct Action"" and I see ""Direct Contact"" now where's ""Retrograde""???This is a bloody farce...where's the movie???? Enjoyed the other 2 as much as one could!! Maybe the movies' in retrograde!!Ya Dig??"
4,Boxing costume,Supper fast shopping!!!My children absolutely loved there costumes.every house that the kids trick or treat at the people loved their costumes:)best Halloween ever!!!
4,Mezzaluna chopping block,My husband had wanted a mezzaluna and I purchased this for him as a birthday gift. We like everything about it except we wish there was some way to store the very sharp blade.
5,Outstanding Book!,"This author weaves stories, mostly case histories--but some personal and family stories--- into a wonderful book about the will to survive despite hardships. Each chapter tells a different story about survival and positivity. At the end of the chapter, the author tells us what the case study has taught her about life's meaning and the true art of survival. At the end of the book the author reflects upon the true art of survival and includes a meaningful message to those readers who are struggling with the aftermath of 9-11-2001.If you buy this book, you will likely read it more than once. You will find yourself relating to her stories---even if you are like me---not a physician! I loved this book so much that I gave it out as my holiday gift to friends and family this year! This book provides a delightful and smooth reading experience."
3,Not as good as rave reviews: Not enough 'there' there!,"I bought this CD because I enjoyed the two cuts included on two different CD comps as published by the British music mag 'Uncut.' For some reason its editors chose this album as one of the tops for the year 2003. I humbly disagree with the choice. The reason is that I'm sorry to say that the two best tracks on the album are the ones I already own. If you listen to the sound samples you will find instrumental music that is spare, eery, and well, chilly. I know that there is a whole subculture of music fans that are enamoured by this form of musical expression. I find that I like it but in small doses. Thus I recommend this album only to people who can sit through an entire CD of this trance-inducing music and warn away people such as myself who, either from a lack of concentration skill, impatience or a fondness for red meat need something more than 50 minutes or so of gauzy if pleasant ambient music."
4,Entrancing? yes.. enlightening? no...,"A nice collection of music that allows you to just relax and listen. Nothing really got my ears perked with the exception of 'unspoken'- which got me up and out of my door to buy the album (or into my seat and online). If I had heard the CD in its entirety to begin with, I might have just gone and downloaded half of the songs somewhere else. However, I'm not disappointed with this purchase in the least."
4,great,"Kieran Hebden creates amazing music under the Four Tet moniker. It is truly beautiful music. It simply must be heard to be understood. Organic and electronic in nature, Four Tet creates the type of music that I love to hear. Essential."
2,disappointed,"After hearing so many people raving on and on about this album I decided to give it a try and what can I say? I was fairly disappointed as in my opinion it is nowhere near the masterpiece everybody said it is. Some of the tracks have beautiful and hypnotic melodies but in the end most of them are just too simple (especialy the beats) and nothing that hasn't been done before and with more style. Maybe my expectations were too high but this cd just doesn't cut it as there are tons of similar yet better produced and more captivating albums out there.If you enjoyed it, good for you, I didn't :)"
5,explores the possibilities of what music can be,"Rounds is a work of sonic bricolage. Unlike lesser artists, Four Tet manages to combine a jumble of sounds into beautifully-interlocking, natural, immediately comprehensible music, without any kitsch or clubby insipidness. Rounds is amazing. Buy it."
2,Too Simple...,This is undoubtedly pretty music but way too simple for it to be the classic album that it is being considered by many. The sounds are not that progressive and the chord progressions are quite naieve. I think music people will see this album as too immature musically to hold much interest.
2,Cheap Tortoise rip off,"Wow! Four Tet sounds much like Tortoise, except not nearly as good. If anyone thinks Four Tet has some shred of decency, go pick up any Tortoise album and be amazed by the difference."
4,Please Note: Only pitched roof covered!,"I love the Edition DETAIL's series of Construction Manuals. These books have taken some of the examples from their wonderful magazines series but is much more comprehensive. It covers the history of the materials, construction methods, material properties, example of projects built recently (within the past 10 yrs) and drawings of the enlarged details precisely and clearly labled. The price is a bit steep but I believe the book is well worth the price because you'll have a hard time finding books like these (concentrated on details) on the market (if you did please share the titles with us). One drawback on books like these is there's a danger the construction methods and details demonstrated in the book could become outdated as the years pass on. Another thing I would like to point out particular to the Roof Construction Manual is the book only covers pitched roof (otherwise I would have given it five stars)."
4,roof construction manual,book in good shape and delivery is quick.amazon's sevice is at least 4 stars
1,This game sucks! Save your money.,"This game was a huge letdown. I bought it on release date, having spent hours enjoying the previous monkey ball releases. I thought it also looked cool that you could fly and jump in this game, but there is nothing cool or fun about this game. Please save your money for something else. I am hoping the Wii Banana Blitz is better. This game sucks. It sucks because you have to play through the lame story mode to unlock the party games. It sucks because of the horrendous loading times. It sucks because the timed stages get very difficult very quickly, where the others in the series had a progression to the more difficult stages. And, it sucks, because that is the sound that is made when you realize that you wasted $50 on a really horrible game."
4,Monkey ball Adventure.,"My grandkids enjoy it. It does take reading, so real young kids have a challenge playing it.I don't think it is as good as the first two monkeyball games."
1,A game that should be FORGOTTEN,"This game SUCKS. Here's why:STORY 3/5 - The story is the best this game has to offer, and it's not that great. You play as AiAi and your duty is to find out what's wrong with the kingdom and to find a lost prince and princess. That's it.GAMEPLAY 2/5 - The first problem you'll notice are bad camera controls and excessive loading screens. You don't really get an idea of where you need to go and you end up lost doing random pointless missions.MULTIPLAYER 1/5 - A total disgrace to the Monkey Ball name. The great Monkey Race is reduced to garbage. You wont find any colorful stages with a sense of balance. They look like someone just doodled lines and decides that was going to be the track. Monkey Target is even worse!! Every mini game will give you 30 second loading screens between each round. You end up spending half of your entire match looking at the loading screen."
3,Another book on catchment hydrology?,"A decently attempted foray into an otherwise exciting, yet overexamined academic topic. Catchment Hydrology is a field on the verge of media saturation, it seems that every scholar has his new catchment hydrology theory he is willing to espouse to packed lecture halls and cable tv hosts throughout the nation. While some have actually made important breakthroughs ( Limerick, Berkowitz et al) others are just falling in line behind the vanguards lapping up the short lived fame and glory. Maybe these ""hydrologists"" should get into the new fad, and by the way guys, pilates is already taken."
1,Way too heavy,"This case is almost as heavy again as the Palm V. If you got a Palm V instead of a III or a HandSpring because the V is smaller and relatively light, you'll hate this case. It makes for a bulky and awkward enclosure that won't fit into a shirt or pants pocket.If you carry the Palm in a purse or briefcase, need something to make it bulletproof, and don't mind that the case has the elegance and refinement of a Humvee, then you won't be disappointed."
3,High Priced But Not High Quality,"The whole concept of this case is great,however it is overpriced and does not work like something in this price range should. To much money for the product. I was very disapointed."
2,Like a tin can...,"Surprisingly junky and primitive; makes the Palm V very bulky, almost Soviet. Easy to pinch and cut yourself with this, so be careful...I traded mine in for the official Palm hard case, which is just fine. (NB. Similar to another reader, my screen cracked when it was in the Palm leather holder with the front loop; $100 to replace, so a hard case is a must in my opinion.)"
1,Consider another case.,"When I bought this case, I thought it would be great because I put a lot of stress on my Palm. I was bitterly disappointed when I found out how heavy it was and how hard it was to adjust the tightness of the case. You basically have to bend the edges against a hard surface to desired fit. Also, the grating sound when sliding the cover on and off will make you clench your teeth. It's like scratching a chalkboard. If you're not careful, the Neoprene on the inside will rip off if you force your Palm in the case. If there was a zero star rating, this product would earn it. My Rhino case is gathering dust..."
1,Overpriced Useless Bulky Case,"The case is very bulky, and poorly made. The case does not close properly, and does not provide an easy undamaging way of removing and reinserting the Palm into its case. In addition, it has sharp pointy edges and shows fingerprint and tarnish very easily. Requires constant cleaning, and the foam Palm support is very fragile. It is also difficult to remove the stylus, and to beam items while in the case. Only recommend if you are very hard on items."
5,want my funk unkut,"loved this book loys of info aboput the band, but my fault was i wanted more details about about the group, and what made them inspire to write the p-funk hits, how george really felt about his material being sampled. what are plans for the mob. george was interesting, bootsy was,nt given enough space. but not a bad place for those who want to learn about p-funk. but will leave funkateers craving more knowledge.this book really needs to be updated. it seems some stuff was left out."
3,A real trip,"I thought the book gave a brief but to the point over view of how the funk mob got started. It was ok but it left out the names of some of the players of the funk ie.. Sheila Horn,Jessica Cleaves Steve Washington,Mickey Atkins to name a few. The funk is long deep and wide."
2,Great hard case - if you plan on going into battle...,"Most people who use a Palm are professionals, students, etc. How many of us REALLY need a TITANIUM case? It looked good online so I checked it out - forger it! If you plan on takign yoru Palm where you need somethign this rough, you're better off not bringing your Palm to begin with. Otherwise, this is VERY bulky (elimiates the slender design of your Palm V).ALso, the side slider can get stuck sometimes. There is a cutout that allows infrared transmission to take place, but think abotu it - that means a small part of your Palm is exposed - defeating this otherwise indestructible case.Pass on this one."
5,Moneysaver,"After cracking the screen on my first hangspring Visor, I decided to try the Rhinoskin Ti slider case for my second visor. Despite the added bulk that the case adds, it is very workable overall. But my love for the case came one day at work when I was up on a 15' tall tower and accidentally knocked the case off my belt (I have rhinoskin's matching belt case for the Ti-slider). The case enclode handspring dropped about 18 feet to the concrete floor. I climbed down and pulled the cse out of the belt pouch, then opened the case. Not a mark on the handspring. Still works perfectly. The case has already payed for itself..."
4,intense female-version of the Omen,"from cover: ""The Birthmark. She was a lovely little girl, with big green eyes, soft pink lips, and flaming red curls. Just one slight blemish marred her beauty: a tiny three-tined stain on her smooth upper thigh. Bit it had the power to pierce her blameless eyes with a seductive gleam, to twist her cherubic smile into a demonic leer, to round her childish body into voluptuous curves...She was a lovely little girl--pure, sweet, innocent--but she bore the devil's mark..the kiss of Satin...the trident"
2,Too Bulky,"I bought this lantern to go with my 12v drill/driver that I have been using many years. Everything works fine, but the unit is much too bulky to include in my toolbox, so it gets left at home."
5,Must Read for Law Enforcement,"This book is great, it goes into detail on the different effects your body has on stress and combat. Its also great for giving family, and friends insight into why you put your life on the line for others. If you are in any kind of military or law enforcement role you need to read this book period."
5,A must for true sheepdogs.,"This is much of the same information as the ""Bulletproof Mind"" lecture but more in depth. Those that understand my review title probably understand already. COL Grossman understands and provides useful information to warriors."
4,Must read for warriors,"I think my review's title pretty much makes my statement. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was out of fairness to my friend Sherman Fleek. I gave his book 4 stars because of loose editing, and this book could have also used some tighter editing.That said, my son is very seriously considering becoming a combat arms officer, so I have had him read this. He is learning a lot that I wish I'd known when I was in his shoes. If I had my way, this book would be required reading in American public schools."
5,Excellent book,"An in-depth look at what happens physically and pshychologically to humans in combat. Law enforcement officers and military folks should absolutely read this book. In fact, since everyone has the possibility of being involved in a violent situation at some point in their lives, I would encourage anyone to read this book. It's very well written and a facinating read."
4,Useful,The content in the first half of the book is useful in helping one prepare mentally for stress of violence. The last half of the book is all about how video games are ruining our children.My soft cover copy fell apart without undue abuse. The binding is crap.
2,"OK, but...","Well written and logically ordered, this is a good read for someone who hasn't been and is never going into combat. And it's written by someone who hasn't been and is never going into combat. For others who have and/ or are on your way, save your money for something that will be more useful to you in combat. Like toilet paper. You gotta go to know. The author hasn't."
1,more crap from Col. Grossman,"I wish that Loren Christianson would distance himself from Grossman,because I really like Christianson's writing's on martial arts.Grossman is a snake oil salesman,and anyone that has been in real ground combat will tell you so,including me."
1,Weapon bigot rambling on,"this man is a dangerous fraud with flawed theories based on little or no evidence. Weapons do not protect citizens, they H A R M citizens. Do some web search to find the truth about this book and its author and do not waste money on it."
2,A Book for Klingons,"This is a book for klingons mainly. Having read and enjoyed his previous work ""On Killing"" I couldn't help but be disappointed in this read. If you can tolerate the use of the word ""WARRIOR"" in almost every paragraph there are some redeeming sections in the book - especially about perceptual distortions under life threatening situations, how to best train for this, and more than enough 'war stories' to satisfy those so inclined.Readability - 3/5 (some good charts - but the link to research a bit tenuous).Content - 3/5 (too much filler material in my opinion).Humour - not that I can recall - serious business this book.Worth a look. But his previous book is even better."
5,Mental prep,This book offers the reader a huge insight into the mind preperation for a warrior. Really a very easy read and ultimately very realistic views on deadly encounters. I would highly recomend this book to anyone in the military or Law Enforcement.
5,Definitive Work,"Lieutenant Colonel Grossman's work is definitive and quite simply the resource of reference when dealing with this subject matter.With Utmost Respect ~ Semper Fi,Hank Salmans,Major & Mustang, USMC (Retired)"
3,good read,"I liked the book, I found too much redundancy and repetition through out the book, I would read a sentence and go hey, didn't I just read that?He needs a new editor. I did learn quite a bit, did not find the answers in which I was hoping to find, but still gained insight and knowledge that I did not have before reading the book. I would have like to have read more about the Troop aspect as opposed to firemen and cops."
4,"Follow Up to ""On Killing""","Good book by two great authors and experts on the ""Warrior Spirit"" and combat/self defense. The book is very detailed and written as a research document, it is not light reading, but revelant data.If you have not read ""On Killing"" by Grossman, I strongly suggest that you read that book first or in addition to On Combat."
3,JuvatFalcon,"An interesting book however not well written ... the reader must dig to find the useful information ... the book repeats ""stories"" time and again ... I read this book just before deploying -- it was interesting but I was preparing to put its recommendations into action and was disappointed in that there just were not many of them and they were ""hard to find"""
4,Great insight,Provides an unprecedented look into the psychology of conflict. It's an eye opener. Well written.
5,"Brilliant ,an excellent document.","Every employee of Veterans Affairs from the Chief down should be made to read this ,maybe then they will have a better prospect of dealing with Returned service personnel. A great Read .Author is qualified Theoretically and empirically to write this inspirational book."
5,Required Reading for all Warriors,I am very greatful that I have gotten to read such an amazing book at the start of my career instead of at the end. This book has put many pieces of the COMBAT puzzle together for me. It offers great insight into what goes on inside a warrior when crap hits the fan. It is most important piece in my collection and I guarantee it will be at the top of yours.I highly recommend this piece to anyone who runs to a battle instead of away from one or anyone who is in the support system of our modern day warriors. I can understand why this is required reading material for several law enforcement groups.The real life stories make the book very interesting and well worth the price and time. Thanks to all who made this book possible. It will be read several more times.
2,Not as good as the ratings,While the book is interesting (lots of storys and actual accounts) [...] It does not go in to the psychology as much as you would hope. [...]If you are a police officer or military you will enjoy the book. If your background is in psychology you will be slightly dissapointed.
3,Unintentional Comedy,"If you can get past Blair Underwood hamming it up every chance you can get this film is a decent flick to watch when you can't catch your z's. However, I think I liked this film for all the wrong reasons. Number one the stalker's death scene was hilarious. It took him about ten years to fall to the ground and the blood bag that was evident as he was getting riddled with bullets made the film laughable as well. Number two, I didn't know that the more crazed a killer got the more eye liner he wore. All in all, this film was atleast watchable."
4,Predictable,Predictable but awesome movie. The plot thickened as the movie went on. The music was very enjoyable. I purchased for a friend and she loved it.
2,Predictable,From the first scene to the last everything in this movie is SO predictable.The scenario is not very elaborated and the scenes are too stereotyped...
5,Wonderful movie that deserves more attention,"I can't believe that this movie didn't receive as much attention as it deserves. All the actors were great but Blair Underwood stole the screen. His transition from nice to ""bad"" was so believable. His decent to madness was worth watching. It was very suspenseful and made you want to know how it ended. It shows what can almost happen in real life when someone loses a loved one and feels betrayed by a friend. When death occurs, many people need someone to blame and this movie definitely shows the effects of anger, betrayal, hurt, seduction and innocence all wrapped in one. It ""almost"" makes you feel sorry for the bad guy(Blair) for a moment. Debbie Morgan and Michael Beach were also excellent!"
5,Excellent film and beautiful actor,"The best movie I've seen in quite awhile. A movie only for the mature audience, showing beautiful people playing dangerous games and having to face life's hardest consequence. This is what seeing movies is all about, seeing the excitement that our own lives lack and making us glad to go back to our boring existence if living life to the fullest brings such horror. I've always adored Blair Underwood. He's been my favorite actor and my nomination as the next Denzel for his excellent and natural acting skills. Michael Beach and Debbi Morgan get a chance in this film to also show their great acting ranges too. Also loved the music by someone named Lionel, especially the funeral dirge ""Wings"" which brought me to tears. Tim Reid - continue doing films. This one was great!"
3,Stalker,This is a well done movie. It feels like a lifetime movie at some points but I like the overall movie. Blair Underwood becomes obsessed with his friend's wife after his wife & unborn child dies. This is a drama filled/Driven movie with good acting. I think the ladies would like this movie the best.
4,wooosh,"this movie really cast me Asunder. At times it seemed as if the actors were speaking in a combination of morse code and tourette's syndrome. Very hard to follow. But, alas, the overall ensunderment value exceeds 25 cosmic units. which will you choose, death or glory? see this movie and find out."
1,Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesus!!!,"This movie was as easy to get through as a Mexican check fuxxy! Why on earth would The Chancellor play a ring-of-fire match when he knew he'd be bird-eyed the entire time? Talk about a grade A crumble! Also, as a doctor of Frozenometry and Levular Dynamics, I will be the first to say that the ensunderment portrayed in this film is scientifically impossible. I move to debunk!"
5,Great stuff,"Back in sixties, Jay Black & the Americans were all over New York Top-40 radio, as well they should have been. Their harmonies were wonderful, and the incredibly-voiced Jay Black out in front was the strongest voice in pop music this side of Jackie Wilson.This collection has all of their hits, and a number of songs that were not hits but otherwise were wonderful nonetheless. The incomparable ""Cara Mia"" and ""Come a Little Bit Closer"" certainly lead the way. Jay's voice is positively operetic (is this a real word?). His song ""She Cried"" is tragic, a la Roy Orbison, although here, the sadness is because Jay left his girlfriend (had Roy sung this, he would have twisted it around so that she cried because she was sad too - after breaking up with him!).Great voices. Great collection."
5,Newbury Comics-- BEST SERVICE EVER !!!,"When I notified NEWBURY COMICS that the wrong CD had been sent, they had ""The Original: Jay & the Americans"" in the mail before I had returned the wrong one. Now THAT is GREAT SERVICE ! 'This Magic Moment' has always been my fav Jay & the Americans track. Now it's 'CARA MIA'. What pipes!"
3,Giants sweatshirt runs small!!,"I bought this for my 15 year old nephew. He's average size and likes to wear his shirts a bit large. I ordered him a mens large and it was snug! Considering the cost of the sweatshirt, I would think it would either run big or true to size. It's a medium weight sweatshirt, the logo has nice detail, it's what we expected aesthetically. I just wish it ran larger!"
3,Not a Total Loss,"Since I like a lot of the Aussie rock I've heard over the years, I thought I'd give this compilation a shot (even tho there were no samples available). After all, with 40 songs there could be some great new discoveries. Actually there were: ""Holy Grail,"" ""Like Wow Wipeout"" and especially ""Creepin' Up Slowly"" were excellent additions to my collection. A couple of others, ""Friday On My Mind"" and ""Evie"" are great too, but I already had 'em. So for over $30 (American) you get (IMHO) 5 really good songs - not a great deal, but I don't know if I would've found the new ones I liked otherwise, so I guess I'm somewhat satisfied..."
2,"Thekla, Wystan, and Chester","This is not biography or an essay about the titular couple, but rather more like selections from Clark's daily diary that concerned Auden and Kallman during her summers in Italy and Austria. Written in stream-of-consciousness recollections, each paragraph flits from reminscence to reminscence, with Clark as the central figure, raising her daughter and reflecting on the meaning of her marriages. Unless a reader is familiar with all the vacationers crossing paths with Clark, many of the paragraphs in this slim volume will be puzzling more than illuminating. The book may be of value to dissertation writers sifting through Audeniana for obscure name references or datelines; for general readers this will vie for longest 120-page book. The personality characteristics of Auden and Kallman come through in some of the anecdotes, while most are snapshots of 50s and 60s domestic life in Europe."
3,Handle With Care,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
4,Progressive Rock Theatre,"Imagine a soundtrack of Boston in the winter, with random passersby reading from a script of Edgar Allan Poe, intermixed with a woman's singing voice that lies somewhere between Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance and Diamanda Galas. That will begin to indicate the eclectic nature of this phenomenal composition. If you like riddles in your listening collection, consider this one."
4,Good Book (I am a BALLER),"Davy Crockett was born August 17, 1786 in a small cabin on the romantic Nolichucky River, near the mouth of Limestone Creek. Crockett became and Indian fighter, a member of the Tennessee legislature, served in Congress, and fought to his death in the Fortress of Alamo along with 139 others, and no one was left to tell the story. Crockett's motto was, ""Be always sure you are right, then go ahead""In this book, Crockett gives his life story in his own words, and for having only six months and three days of schooling it is very interesting. The book gets very tense, especially when he is attacked by a Mexican Cougar. I would have to say this book is a delightful masterpiece, and every person on the planet should be able to get there hands on this instant classic."
1,Missing parts,"The seller failed to send the table insert as shown in the product photograph, I wrote to Amazon and received no reply. The photograph of the item shows three components and the ad refers to a kit. In Amazons request for a packing evaluation I mentioned that one piece was missing.Walter H. Klaus"
1,Ripped off,"Did not include jet 3"" table insert. Have to go elsewhere to get the insert. Would have been less expensive to have purchased both items together elsewhere. Amazon usually good about watching for this kind of thing, but missed it on this one. Of course you would assume ""assembly"" included the insert when it does wit other vendors. Very disappointed as a Prime customer. I expect to be protected from this sort of thing by Amazon Prime."
2,THIS IS NICE BUT IT IS LITTLE.,"IF YOU NEED A CUTTING BOARD THIS ONE IS SMALL, OK TO CUT ONE LITTLE ONION ON,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY LARGER BORAD."
4,Here's why I'm glad I bought this dvd.......,"I admit that I was a little bit disappointed with the quality of this dvd, but some of the songs are really good. The real reason I'm glad I purchased this is because the song listings (that showed what dvd they originally came from) encouraged me to buy other dvds that are FANTASTIC. Yellowman Live and Don Carlos Live are excellent dvds, and that made it worth buying this one. It's not a 5, but I really love some of the songs...and it's worth the price."
5,blue topaz earrings,"These were given to my daughter for Christmas, they arrived in a little velvet like bag and are very nice. Good product, good price, fast shipment. Very happy"
5,Great basic toddler shoe,This is a great basic tennis shoe with velcro straps. You get what you would expect from Stride Rite and the picture on Amazon.
3,A manly soap dish?,"Well this soap dish appealed to my nautical tastes. I really like it. Who needs one of those girly porcelin or cheap plastic soap dishes! The only downside is the accumulation of soap debris that collects on top, but it is easily washed off before your guests arrive:)"
1,Palm user,"If I could give it less then one star I would, because this is terrible. On my brand new Palm IIIc it completely scratched the screen. Do not buy this product, trust me!"
4,Very Helpful,"It not only gives you graphic organizers and information for specific stories, but it also has some generic ones that help if you don't have the specific stories discussed in the other graphic organizers. Very helpful."
4,"Cute, but what they don't tell you...","This is super cute, the little beads go on the earphone cords and the little earrings clip onto the earbuds. What they don't mention is that this is just the backplate. You still need to purchase the faceplates to make a complete transition on your Barbie Girl MP3 player from stock."
2,Works but doesn't seal very well on the can,"I've used this type of can tap quite a few times and this is the first one that doesn't seal well at all. It works though, just hisses a little."
4,dark and dirty texas rock,"tx rock doesn't get any darker than this. banjos, lap steel, madolins, couple drummers and some guitars. sounds superfluous, it isn't. it's like a drunk spouting firewater poetry. they kick serious ass live. it's not country, it's not rock, it's country rock the way it's intended. the devil would be proud. i highly reccomend this album. and in addition, they are working on another. the label they're on is TXMF."
1,Too Short a fence,"I own the Hitachi C10FS sliding compound miter saw. I love the saw but hate the fence. It is too low for easy and uncomplicated cutting of crown molding. You have to have a good knowledge of the angles you need to cut inside or outside crown molding corners. With a taller fence you can set the molding in an installed position and then just cut a 45 degree angle. Once again, the saw itself is great."
1,Sony LCSFHA Soft Camera Case,"Great case, but the plastic latch is a piece of JUNK. The is second case of this type that I have purchased, the latch failed on both cases. Complained to Sony but they claimed no responsibility in their product. I would not recommend this camera case for this reason."
4,Good quality Case,"Fits the sony 828 perfectly , yet there is no exra pockets for either extra battery or flash"
4,Big Book Pocket Chart,I'm using it for poster-sized graphic organizers that we use day after day. Big books were way too heavy to hang up. Not really realistic unless using industrial strength hooks. Working great though!
1,Yuck,"I am a big animated movie fan, whether it be Disney or Dreamworks or whatever, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only redeeming quality was the Leann Rimes song, and that Cary Ewles was the voice of the lead man, but this movie was very bad. Even the jokes that the dragons tried to make were awful."
4,Good movie,My kids saw this on TV and requested it for a birthday gift. They have watched it several times now and still love it.
3,B-grade Bad-guys ; Gnarly Forest!,"The B-grade Bad-guys are devoid of motive and dimension---as is the wimpy waif of an Arthur. Yet the film has some endearing moments: the animation of the forbidden forest with its writhing tree limbs, monster-eating plants, grasping branches, and helicopter flowers, is charming (nothing quite like it in any of the Disney-forests); the two-headed dinasour who can never fly because it can never agree with itself (among the better of the animated world's comic side-kicks); and the reluctant romance between a blind forest-dweller (who reminded me a little of Tolkien's Bombadil) and the damsel he rescues---are a few of its unique and surprising highlights. The opening scene too---skimming across the wave-flecked ocean before suddenly rising up and over a huge promontary--- somehow creates a mood similar to the one I felt during ""Castle in the Sky."" Enchanted."
2,Arthurian legends meets 'Riverdance',"A pretentious work. Kayley and the two-headed dragon are about the only successfull characters the film. Voice actors were obviously chosen according to their fame and not on how suitable they would be for the character . In particular King Arthur is a catastrophy in this respect (Pierce Brosnan) as is his stiff animation, never saw Arthur as such a winp. The computer animations in this film mix poorly with the rest."
2,saved from 0 stars by delightful cast,its a great all-star cast that saves this awful cartoon with awful animation and awful songs from being the worst ever but they still can't save it completely
1,No,"Bad cast. Retarted storyline. Plot is very weak. Character devleopment is so-so. Graphics ok. Music ok-but-could-be-better. The only reason you should get this movie is to please your 6 year old daughter. I think she would like this because the girl is the main character. The two headed dragon was a bit funny, but not enough to make you crack up. Warner Bros., made this movie, didn't they? Gawd, I got this movie because I thought it would be as good as The Iron Giant (A must-see). The director is very unexperenced. If you want to find the perfect movie for your child,or yourself, get a Disney or Dreamwokrs one, but you can't always trust Warner Bros. for a good movie."
1,not a dvd,I was really disappointed when I received this package and the movie was not a dvd - rather a VHS tape - I no longer have a VCP - only a DVD player - I had to discard the movie - I wasn't sure this was indicated when I made the purchase - it could be my mistake - however I didn't think movies were still sold on VHS
5,Better then Disney!!!,"I loved this film! The Animation was the best that I have ever seen from any non Disney project.. For those that don't know, Christopher Reeve was originally supposed to be Kong Arthur.. Due to his accident, he had to bow out... Kaley was a young girl that proved that she was worthy of being a part of the round table... Great film for lovers of Animation...."
2,get it cheap at wallmart,This movie is a little over priced but If you can get it out of the $5.50 bin at wall mart it isn't so bad.
1,I real sorry but this was a bad movie!!!!!,I went to see this movie with my sister who was three at the time and a friend who was seven then. My little sister had to leave the theater it was so scary! It didn't make sense! The first thing they showed was her dad getting killed!!!!!!!! Then all these people getting turned into monsters! I mean come on! The comercails made it seem like a little girl movie! I hate this movie and I don't recomend it!!!!!!!!!
1,Quest for Crud,"This movie stinks.It has zero true connection to the Arthurian Legend.It rips off almost Disney film you can think of.Some of the songs don't fit into scenes they were used in.There are lots of the scenes from the movie that had zero explanation like BladeBeak turning into a good guy.The villan song is just awful and just as bad as the songs from the Tom & Jerry Movie.The ONLY good thing about this movie is they introduced the famous song ""The Prayer"". I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Don't waste your money...,"The main problem with this film is there's just way too many songs- and NONE are enjoyable.With the focus of the movie being music, there really wasn't much done with the actual story. The plot is great- a young girl who wants to become a knight like her father (who was killed) goes on a quest to find the legendary sword, Excalibur, which was stolen and lost in the forest. They could have done so much with this plot if they only left out all the music! Reading the description on the back of the box is much more enjoyable than actually watching how they ruined what could've been a really good film."
4,Great movie!,Fast shipment and movie was in good shape. It's a fun classic that I brought for my grown son since it was a childhood favorite!
3,Cute movie,"This was a interesting film that is set in the Camelot universe (after King Arthur) and focuses on a female protagonist who is the daughter of one of the Knights of the Round Table. The storyline and animation were decent, and while this isn't the greatest movie, it's an okay one."
4,4 year old daughter loves this movie.,We had this on Netflix and when instant streaming expired I knew I had to buy this movie. My 4 year old daughter wants to watch it at least once a week.
4,Great Movie,I chose to buy this DVD depsite some of the poor reviews and I'm glad I did. I'm constantly lending to my coworkers who have all enjoyed it. It's an excellent movie for any kid or kid at heart.
2,not worth it,This isnt as good as a disney movie.The animation is poor and the music is to.I woldnt buy this movie if I were you.
1,Not for toddlers!,"Very disappointed by the violence! The characters were very scary, dark & deadly I found this movie very upsetting to my granddaughter(2 years old) who loves to watch The Sword & the Stone, Tangled, the Tinker Bell Collection, Lady & the Tramp, etc.. She was very upset with the death of the father at the beginning also. As a ""sequel"" to Sword & the Stone, it should be burned!Just wanted to warn any parents(or grandparents) before purchasing or renting."
5,Beautiful soundtrack!,This is one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. It's sound track is excellent. I find myself rewinding certain parts just to see my favorite songs over again. The movie is very funny and has a good plot as well. It also shows how someone can overcome obstacles such as blindness.
3,wonderful acid lake sequence,"The movie is a failed effort at the Disney formula. The character animation is poor, although the animated effects sequences are top notch. A particularly beautiful scene is where the characters are attempting to cross a lake of acid. The water and fire in this sequence are simply amazing! The effectiveness of the animation truly adds an intense quality to the scenes! These scenes alone are reason enough to purchase this video. Hats off to whomever animated these wonderful elements!"
2,"Half the movie that ""Mulan"" is","I'm a mature adult male, but I find that a well done ""kids movie"" can transcend many of the limitations inherrent to those intended for adult audiences. A well done ""kids movie"" can be ""ageless."" That being said, the producers of ""Quest for Camelot"" didn't have a clear idea of the target audience: going from ridiculously extreme childishness in some parts, to other parts in which the humor is likely only going to be appreciated by adults familiar with old-time R-rated movies. Now, that may be forgivable, but...Using five-star ""Mulan"" as the standard, ""Quest for Camelot"" lacks quality in so many areas. The animation itself is poorer, the story rather less uplifting, the soundtrack more raw. ""Quest for Camelot"" is not completely without redeeming features - that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 - but it's a far cry from the excellence of ""Mulan."""
4,Entertainment for everyone,Quest for Camelot is an excellent movie for children and adults. My 3 year old and my mother were enthralled by the picture. It was a movie that kept you watching and you loose track of time. I could compare to Disney movies but some Disney movies aren't even this good.
3,"A Very Sweet Movie, if a Bit Weird at Times","Quest for Camelot is a cute movie with some poignant moments. Most of the songs are excellent (a few slightly annoying ones which it is OK to skip after watching the first time). The plotline is rollicking and fun to follow. However, the showcase of a talented and upbeat cast is slightly marred by the low-quality animation, where more often then not the facial movements of the characters don't quite match the recorded voices. Other than that, this is a fun movie that deserves revisiting. It's got a spunky, girl-power heroine; a wise and brave blind hero (a new twist in an animated movie to give a breif peek into the world of the blind); and a classic greedy villain who everyone loves to hate, plus a two-headed dragon and an axe-nosed chicken for comic relief! What more could an animated movie ask for? (besides better animation, but I won't go into that)"
4,Great film for young girls,"Though many people seemed to have trouble with this film, I find it to be very well done. There are no worse monsters in this film and it is no darker than Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dome. My seven year old daughter loves this movie, as well as the music. Though there are monsters, it reminds me of the Snow White-type scary creatures when the main character wakes up in the forest.Kayle is a positive role model for young girls and Garret is the type of boy you'd want your daughter to become a knight with. I would recommend it to others, and have done so."
3,A disappointment in many respects,"I rented this tape for my 4-year-old son who loves anything to do with Knights. While he liked it, I, as a parent, was not pleased. The story is simple, which is good, but in order to make the movie longer, it becomes a relentless string of fairly violent confrontations and there are an awful lot of monsters. It's a much darker film than I'd expected. The light-hearted antics of the dragons seem out of place alongside the dark intensity of the evil characters and the almost constant destruction and violence."
5,Great!,"I love this movie. The dragon's are great, bicker bicker bicker. The music is good, I bought the soundtrack. The movie has a strong leading female if you are looking for that. It stresses the importance of teamwork as well, most of the problems the characters face are resolved by teamwork. It's a good Disney story that ends right."
1,Lackluster Animation with By-The-Book Storyline.,"I've seen this same storyline about 100 times before; plucky heroine on a quest, meets partner to help with quest-- and, oh yeah, goofy creatures/animals (that talk, natch) to provide comic relief. This one lands in the BORING category. Not worth a look."
4,Family Fun and More!,"Stretching the truth of the Knights Of The Round table, just a little, this is a great story for kids. Teaching them courage and trust and friendship.The voices are great, Cary Elwis, Pierce Brosnen, Jane Seymore, John Cleese, Don Rickles and the singing talents of the Corrs, Celene Dion and Steve Perry. This has a wonderful score and the soundtrack is just as good. Great lyrics and music.The DVD has three fun features that make it just as interesting for the adults and the kids, but I am sure the kids will have far more fun. Technically it is a well put together film and the music and sound effects are brilliant.The story is sweet and touching and the comedy sprinkled throughout. A must for every family or animated feature fan!"
2,If you're looking for some mindless history...,"Not a bad book, you could be reading something completely devoid of content. However, I am very concerned about not only the content in this book (""Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy""???) but also the way is presented. At various points throughout my reading, I felt as if my intelligence were being insulted. Perhaps this book is aimed more at a non-history lover kind of audience and is written in a ""verbal-candy"" kind of way. At any rate, if you can't get the middle name of one of your main subjects right (it's Robert FRANCIS Kennedy for anyone not in the loop), then what about all of the other details? I am left wondering how much of the content was historically accurate and how much is there purely for entertainment. If books were newspapers, this one would be somewhere between the New York Post and Star (the tabloid)."
5,SLOWING DOWN THE WORLD,"Slowing Down The World (1999) is definitely a classic from Chris Botti who puts out real music w/ much sultry and jazzy feel to it. The thing I like about him is that he's always sound more relaxed w/o too much vibe 2 it. I think the matter of it is that every jazz artist/lover or trumpet player of course should pick this album. 'Cuz this is one of my favorites to date. Even though I haven't bought it yet, I'ma still purchased it once I get a job or sumthin. Most songs that interest me from this CD are Irresistable Bliss, Drive Time and Why Not (definitely a classic). People called him the Chet Baker of the Trumpet or the next James Dean of Jazz which people might say."
5,Blissful Moody Melodies,"This is a collection of beautiful , well, orchestrated, and performed jazz music that sooth the soul and lift the spirits, perfect for those sleepless nights or after a long hard day."
3,good and bad,"I still have mixed feelings about this movie. At times it becomes rather bumbling, and a bit hard to follow as it jumps between subplots. You never really, truly get to know any of the characters on more than a surface level--although this could have been Turturro's point: audiences only become acquainted with actors' parts and their public images, not the real people. As for good points, Illuminata has a pretty great cast. Susan Sarandon is good and Christopher Walken is delightful, but I was especially taken with Rufus Sewell and Katherine Borowitz. When they (along with Georgina Cates) finally perform Tuccio's (Turturro) play Illuminata, it was so tender and beautifully done that that one scene pretty much made up for any of the movie's shortcomings, as far as I was concerned. Illuminata is certainly an interesting movie, and despite any complaints I have about it, I don't regret seeing it. There are some truly lovely moments."
1,This is not The Beatles...,the songs on here are neither written or performed by The Beatles... This is just random footage put together in random order..
3,"Not a ""cutting"" board - this is a ""carving"" board","JK Adams makes fine wooden cutting boards. With the proper care, these boards perform well and provide a great cutting surface.However, this board should not be called a ""cutting board."" Really it is a ""carving board."" The side shown in the picture has a large groove around the edge. This is great for cutting cooked meat and the like, but it takes away from the cutting area. The reverse side has an imprint for a roast or poultry. Both sides are good for carving meat, but neither provides a nice surface for cutting and chopping."
3,A Day In The Dirt/Celebs on Bikes,"Fun video if your an MX or off road racer but may not hold the interest of the casual viewer. Great old footage from the 60's showing some of the greats from the past then quickly moves to the here and now following a well known stuntman through the weekend. Interviews with riders young and old, famous and unknown. Some repetitiveness, lots of shots of unidentified bikes racing by. This is a once every two year viewing for me. Fun but nothing to bring me back over & over. If I had it to do over I'd still buy it but then I'm a MX'r and can't resist anything to do with Motocross."
2,Not worth it for a large strong dog!!!!,"I bought this for my 90 lbs Catahoula American bull dog. He is very strong, and he broke it in few minutes. Moreover, he eats about anything, but he was not too thrilled with the stuffing inside. He didnt even eat it and went back to playing with his kong. So, honestly, my dog eats everything, its not worth the price. I would pay $2 for it, if I had too."
1,Disapointment in the publisher,"We have ordered this book twice since April of 2007. Both times the publisher and Amazon have canceled our order due to the book not being available after waiting approximately 8 weeks for delivery. It's truly been a disapointment. Maybe we will get the book before our dog turns 10! He's currently 10 months old and fortunately with a very good trainer right now. The book came highly reccommended by the trainer, we are just unable to obtain it. Thanks for nothing!"
5,Finally!,Finally there is a book for the pointing retriever. It is thorough and clear. I found it extremely useful.
2,"Good explinations, bad exercises","While the book itself is not bad in general, one of the most frequent uses, the exercises, is definitely lacking. The explanations are quite good and the questions are imaginative and try to tie parts of mathematics together, but half of the time the questions are so vague that even though you understand the chapter you can't answer the questions because you don't know exactly what they're asking! This tends to run throughout the book and can be VERY frustrating."
5,insight to muslims/arabs,"I read this book years ago and was blown away by Mr. Pryce-Jones insights. He grew up with these people and knows his subject. If you want to understand way more than you do now, read this book. Highly recommended!"
1,Hateful,"Mr. Pryce-Jones has managed to put together a multitude of reasons why we of the advanced West should never trust an Arab. They're untrustworthy, they care only about their own clan, they make a practice of political murder, etc, etc.Mr. Pryce-Jones has apparently never experienced the upside of dealing with Arabs, such as their ability to negotiate reconciliations and the basic freedom of belief that exists in most portions of the Arab world. This book reminds me of the kind of material printed about the Japanese during World War II. It provides us with all we need to hate the Arabs.How fitting that a new edition is coming out now, just while the USA is planning another war against Iraq. Perhaps the publisher should consider a gift-boxed edition for the Christmas season."
5,A must read,This explains the problem of dealing with a middle eastern culture with a western european perspective.
4,Telephone Test Set,"The right tool for the job when trouble shooting phone wiring in the house. Add a DSL filter for checking those lines, too."
4,Comprehensive introduction to SWT,"This is a straightforward, well written, book on SWT. It starts with installation and goes through the windowing model, the event model, and the entire toolkit in an introductory manner, covering each topic in depth with example code an illustrations. It's not a reference book, it's a walkthrough the toolkit.The book is well organized, code isn't overused and illustrations are used effectively. The lack of a reference portion is the only fault that I can find with the book. Once you have read it you are done, there is no reason to return for a quick reference. Most similar books have a reference section in the appendix.If you are looking to use the SWT, or you want to evaluate it, then this is a solid introduction to the toolkit."
4,Good for what it is,This is a great introduction and reference for SWT. I find myself reffering back to it fairly often. My only complaint is that it doesn't also cover JFace.
1,Ignore the other Reviews!,This is not what other reviewers lead you to believe. It is NOT a compliation of the first 2 CDs and it has some of the WORST classical music ever. Considering using it as a coaster as there is no other value. Terrible purchase.
5,Truly Wonderful!,"As the authors of the book from which this Light Meditation was excerpted we are delighted to find this CD on Amazon! Sheri Menelli has an exceptional voice and the additional soothing and empowering suggestions she gives on the CD are outstanding. Truly a wonderful CD with which to gift self and loved ones for bringing greater peace, strength and power.With Light, Pamela Chilton and Dr. Hugh Harmon, authors of Odyssey of the Soul, Apocatastasis"
3,Not Relaxing Enough,I was disappointed in this cd. The speaker moves too quickly to the light visions and didn't give me enough time to relax my mind and body.
1,VERY CHEAP PRODUCTION,Probably the worst Elvis Presley DVD ever released . Bad sound and picture. No rare photos or footage. Avoid .
5,cute humor book,I keep several of these books in my guest rooms as light reading with a tropical touch. My guests have told me they appreciate being able to read a couple of pages before they go to sleep and not have to get involved with a plot-line in a book and they also appreciate the beachy humor. The books seem to appeal most to adults and older children. They have a permanent place in my Florida home.
5,One of the best comics since Calvin and Hobbes,Sherman's Lagoon is one of the funiest comics since Calvin and Hobbes went away. It never fails to bring me a laugh.
3,Submarine Horror...,"The submarine U.S.S. Tiger Shark is on a routine mission when they encounter some survivors from a sunken British ship. As the survivors come on board the U.S.S. Tiger Shark, the crew of the submarine begin to notice strange occurrences that begin to intensify as the crew gets closer to the truth behind the mysterious incidents. Below presents a reasonable story, but there are some elements of the complete story that have been tarnished and this then affects the overall cinematic experience."
4,Nice direct to video,Here's a movie I had never heard of before I saw it. I work at a video rental place and we got in advance screeners before the movie came to video/dvd. What is great about it is that it does what it says on the cover. It is U-571 meets Poltergeist. I can't think of a better description. The suspense & action are there with a twist. Is the ship really haunted or are the crew suffering from oxygen depredation due to mechanical difficulties? Watch it and you decide.
2,Ghost Ship it ain't,"In fact it's more like Event Horizon underwater. The first half was pretty cool and built up a good deal of suspense. But as it nears the end the story falls into incoherence and suffers from obviously deleted scenes. If the script were tighter then this film could have been great as David Twohy's direction is not really to blame.He creates a unique atmosphere and nice underwater visuals that give the film an original look. I just wish that the horror/spooky aspect of the movie were stronger. When the ghosts appear they do so in a genuinely creepy way that seems 'realistic'. It's these parts of Below that I like but it gets way too silly towards the end. The cast is unusually solid with the exception of Olivia Williams, who is horribly miscast and fails to make any connection with the audience or bring her character to life.The DVD is sports a powerful Dolby 5.1 soundtrack with a great looking 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer."
2,wake me up,"This was slow paced for me. The horror was too subtle and delicate to leave an impression on me. I do not find ""submarine"" movies boring, ever, I never even thought of them as in that category.The eeriness was washed over by the lenght of the movie.The end was interesting, because of the way that one perticular person changed ( I don't wanna give anything away) but other than that it wasn't anything scary or special."
2,Darren Aronofsky's Lesser Work,"I'm a vast fan of Darren but this screenplay is just not up to his other works. The entire cast is annoying, the thrills are hackneyed tricks, (doors fly open with a blast with people suddenly standing there, etc). I couldn't relate to or cheer for anyone, and it was disjointed, predictable, with a soundtrack that made it difficult to follow dialogue, and parts of the period just did not look period enough. No thrills, no chills, and I just wanted to smack these annoying, annoying characters. Others may love this movie, I did not. But I know Darren cant be hurt by my little review."
4,Creepy thriller,"Below is not a horror film. If you are looking for a gory story, this movie is probably not for you. Below is more than anything else a very creepy, old-fashioned ghost story. In WWII, a US sub is ordered to pick up three survivors from a torpedoed British hospital ship. It soon becomes apparent that both the survivors and the sub's senior officers are harboring secrets. Some reviewers have complained that the film is boring. I've have seen the film three times and it consistently held my interest, even though I agree that the ending is somewhat predictable. What makes the film work for me is that it is a completely creepy and original ghost story and also a solid, action-oriented, WWII sub movie. I think both ghost story fans and submarine aficionados will find Below to be well worth watching."
3,"Good story, good movie. Nothing great, but nevertheless enjoyable.","There's a big mystery going on ""Below"" the surface of the ocean. The captain of a WWII submarine is haunted by ghosts and he's having U-boat pursuit issues, too. A very atmospheric film that is always interesting and fun to watch, but never especially scary. More of an underwater ghost story/mystery than a horror film, but nevertheless fun to watch. If you don't set your expectations high, you'll probably like this movie."
2,Ghost story with a submarine motif,"You have seen this story a million times. There is nothing new and no new twists. It is just a strait forward ghost story that just happens to be on a submarine instead of a hotel or in a bayou. It is still fun to watch this rendition.A US Sub in WWII picks up a life-boat with three passengers. There is something suspicious about the passengers and their situation. While we are keeping our eyes on the life-boat passengers, we come to realize that maybe they are not the suspicious ones here. Is some insidious force out to get revenge or set things straight?"
4,As Submarine crews go this nails it,"As an ex-submariner with a total of 16 patrols and over 4 years submerged I can say this is how submarine crews truely are. The set is nearly 100% accurate for an old diesel boat and has a very real feel throughout the movie. You can almost feel the same dirty grity smelly feel of a diesel boat sailor.The ""eccentric"" nature and behavior of each member of the crew is as true to life as you can get with out having to go through it yourself. Yet the team work, discipline and mission secrecy asspect remain intact and add a cult like element when seen through the eyes of survivors they pick up. The main plot revolves around a kind of ghost story, and is the only part that doesn't fit reality but certainly fits well in this movie. If you are submarine movie fan or just like the off beat this is a good movie."
5,VERY INTENSE and VERY INTERESTING...,"It wasn't as scary as I'd hoped, but it was a great movie nontheless. I loved the effort that was put into making the sub look authentic. It had some comic relief that made the movie fun, but I could have done without it. I thought 'GhostShip: Sea Evil' was scarier. They're just two different types of movies. I love both of them though. I recommend both of them the same. A MUST HAVE!!!"
2,boring but a good cast selection,"I wasnt that great watching this movie but a great cast was ensembled here but they are wasted and the movie goes deeper below. Bruce Greenwood, Dexter Flectcher, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng, Matthew Davis and the awesomely hilarious but wasted Zach Galifianakis as Weird Wally star. its not that horrible but it got boring after awhile and somewhat perdictable"
1,Postmodern trash.,"This is one of those in the new postmoderns style with half the movie filmed in a dim blue light, and most of it shot in rapid film clips that make you dizzy. The dialouge is often unintelligble (a real handicap in thriller/mystery), the plot improbable and the execution ludicrous. Regarding the latter, the filmmakers have the audacity to place characters that are more likely to be found on the boardwalk of Venice, California in 2006 (replete with full-body tatoos, venacular, etc.) than on a sub in WWII. Stay away from this hoax."
1,Dive! Dive! Dive!,"...and avoid this appalling piffle. Sorry, but I think this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Inaccurate historically (when did the Germans have enough surface ships to chase US submarines in the Atlantic?), laughable ""story"", ham acting. I usually enjoy submarine films, which is why I got this one. One makes these little mistakes in life..."
1,"Boring submarine film, No special effect/computer graphic","This is absolutely a boring film. The submarine is supposed to be made before 1945 but it looks like a product made in 1980! There is NO computer graphic or any special effect in this film. You can see all crews from the beginning to the end very scared of nothing. I say nothing because there is nothing in the sub(no ghost at all). Just another psychological drama(poorly made)! Don't buy its DVD, or it'll be waste of money!"
5,A ghostly thrill in a WWII submarine....,"Lots of dark, narrow corridors and a claustrophobic feel are what I got with this movie. It is a ghost story set aboard a sub during World War II. Several tense moments and a ""Did I see that?"" feel.This is a ghost story and ghosts often want revenge.I enjoyed ""Below"" because of the supernatural element and lack of gore so many other horror movies have."
1,Awful,"Besides the bad plotting and total lack of suspense, what bothered me the most about this movie is Hollywood's contiued agenda-driven passion of displaying military men as the lowest scum of the earth; cowardly men with terrible manners and worse language, men with total lack of character and values, devoid of any concept of loyalty, who kill, not the enemy, but each other, men who dress and look like total slobs. The men depicted on this sub would never be allowed into the miltary, especially around the time of WWII. How would it have hurt the story to have these men actually act like men? Answer; it wouldn't. Just part of the agenda. Anyone else notice this? (PS..the acting was very good.)"
4,Almost snuck by...,"I was lucky enough to notice an advanced screening review for this film online, so I was able to catch it in the theater when it was released. But even while actively looking for it, I still almost missed it! It's distributer, Dimension, a subsidiary of Mirimax, just plopped it out with virtually NO advertisement at all. The only TV commercial I saw was while visiting Dallas, with no ads ever seen in my home city of Houston. Still, my persistence paid off and I did see it on the big screen, thinking what a shame it was that this unique and high quality film should receive such shoddy treatment from Dimension. This could have been a sleeper hit, had they advertised just a bit more. I strongly recommend Below as a cross-genre success, with superb sub action a la Das Boot, and sublime creepiness a la 1963's The Haunting. If you like it, do David Twohy a favor and turn on others to this fine gem! Everyone I've had see it is pleasantly surprised with it."
4,Destined to cult status....,"Since DImension buried any chance thismovie could have of being recognized as a very good suspense piece, with solid casting, good acting, decent special effects and intriguing plot, this picture is destined to cult status,And it's a very solid movie. Since the great opneing of a CAtalina flying over the Atlantic to the final, the movie grabs your attention, even leaving some questions unanswered.Bruce Greenwood proves once againthat he deserves more first class opportunities in the Hollywood comunnity."
4,"Predictable, but very well done thriller","I had wanted to see Below in the theatre but never had the chance. I finally rented it on DVD last weekend. Yes you know where the movie is going the whole time, but the one thing this movie has is mood. There are some pretty creepy scenes. Unlike some people,I loved the fact they kept the CGI ghost stuff to a minimum. That way it didn't get old. Anyway if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a pretty good movie that is worth the rental pick this up. If you like this movie I highly recommed ""The Devil's Backbone"". It is another ""thriller, horror"" movie that is more than meets the eye."
3,"Great Genre Movie, But Something's Missing","A terrific setup, creepy atmosphere, fine acting, and a superb sound mix make for an entertaining genre flick. I saw it when it came out, but I left the theater unsatisfied. There's some kind of payoff missing from this movie. As much as I admire the look and feel of it and the swell direction, I wish it packed more of a whollop."
1,It is a piece of junk. It dulls in under 5 cuts. BUYER BEWARE,The blade is the most inferior and over priced I have purchased. I later found a carbide excellent quality blade at a local hardward store that is makita brand and carbide for only $80.00 I suggest to buyers stay away from this china junk and look for a carbide makita brand blade for the close to the same price.
3,somewhat helpful but more for school-age kids,"I think this book would be very helpful to parents of older children who notice a speech impediment or delay. It was less helpful to me, a parent of a preschooler, since my daughter doesn't have much speech to work with and her problems appear to be more fundamental. It's full of information about negotiating with school districts and special education programs, again of more use to parents of older children."
5,Just what I needed!,"I just got the new edition of this book. I had read the earlier one at the library a few months ago. I have a 3 1/2 year old who has been receiving speech therapy for about a year. This new edition included more information I needed about his oral-motor problem. I read the previous review, but I would disagree. There is quite a bit of helpful information for the parent of a younger child. Also, the information about the school process was very important because I didn't realize until I read the book (before) that the school would be able to help my son, even though he wasn't in school yet. There is a whole chapter on infant/toddler problems. Anyhow,I love this book. It's an ""easy read"" and it has helped me understand my son much better.I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in speech problems."
2,Disappointing,"I found the section on listening problems in this book a big disappointment. I was looking for more information on delayed auditory processing, and I felt the section on auditory memory wasn't very clear.I thoroughly recommend ""The Mislabeled Child"" by Brock Eide, MD MA and Fernette Eide, MD for a clear assessment of listening challenges for children, and a more practical approach to classroom problems.The Mislabeled Child: Looking Beyond Behavior to Find the True Sources and Solutions for Children's Learning Challenges"
2,Bland & Overrated,"I had pretty high expectations for this record going in based on what I'd read. Sometimes, well, often, people tend to romanticize these so-called lost recordings. Most of them end up nothing better than was was never lost. This album is pretty bland, straightforward early '70s funk. While it's not bad, I'll probably never listen to it again because I could name at least 200-300 funk/soul CDs that are better than this one. If you want a real lost classic with an original sound, look up Fugi's ""Mary Don't Take Me on No Bad Trip,"" from the late 1960s."
4,"Pablo Cruise ""The Facts""","The issue about Ocean Breeze. It's a great song from their first ""Self Titled"" album. Ocean breeze is nearly 12 and a half minutes long. ""Zero to Sixty-Five"" is a great song but is easily dwarfed by the elegance of Ocean Breeze. Contrary to popular belief Ocean Breeze WAS released on CD on the A&M Classics Volume 26 ""Pablo Cruise"" CD2524/DX003418 which included most of their great songs except ""Zero to Sixty-Five"""
2,"F Y I--- ""Zero to Sixty in Five"" is the best on this CD","Hey Rich-Get your sources straight! Some portions of ABC's Wide World of Sports theme song was taken from ""Zero to Sixty in Five"". Also, the instrumental song, ""Ocean Breeze"" is from Pablo Cruise's first album simply labled- Pablo Cruise. It has a gorilla in the center of a jungle landscape, released originally on the A&M recording label."
2,something missing,"Ok, you see two stars up there and you start thinking to yourself ""whatcould possibly be wrong with this album"" Well, there is something wrongwith this album. If you do not believe me then look it up for yourself.This does have great songs on here and all of their hits to mention that.But I just noticed something, and I have had this album for a year ortwo. There is three songs that is not on here that was hits on the radio.They might not have been big hits, but they did get air play. (missingyou) from their ""tight rope"" album (you'll always be loved by me) fromtheir ""tight rope"" album and (I am that man) from the ""boarderline"" album."
4,Pure Industrial Music,bEnESTroPHe is the roots of Mentallo & the Fixer. Same category as old school Front Line Assembly and Skinny Puppy. Auric Fires to me is pretty much a hardcore industrial experience 90s style. This CD is worth listening to. Enjoy!
5,Well worthwhile,"Great series. I highly suggest it. It is hard to come by now but Amazon offered the best price on this volume, hands down."
4,Lots of cd's bought and even fewer worth playing...,...cd 1 ok. cd 2 awsome. I'll include cd 2 in my play list.peace...~Tony;o{}~
5,classic jams,"Phyllis Hyman was not only one of the Greatest vocalists that i have ever heard, but she was a stunning looking lady that just a aura about her. the title track is my jam and I can groove to that onew Jam all day. she was a artist who had songs that dealt with inner issues and themes and she left her heart out in the open and didn't hold nothing back,but she also created so many styles of music that highlighted her overall depth and Greatness. a must have. She was cut from the Nancy Wilson school of singers and Hyman's style and overall depth i hear on Whitney Houston,Mariah Carey Beyonce and also Mary J.Bliege."
5,Wonderful set,"Really beautiful singer, I wish she would be more recognised. The production by Mtume is funky and beautiful. what a great singer"
5,FANTASTIC...great for my sensitive skin,"I have extremely sensitive skin. With alot of facial cleansers I have experienced the cycle of using a drying cleanser, then oil overproduction on my face to compensate and finally breakouts. This cleanser is nice because I do not feel my face is raw or stripped after I use it. My skin does not have the strange ""residue"" that you feel from some cleansers either, it simply feels clean. This seems to be provide a balanced way to cleanse sensitive skin and I will not use another cleanser again. I use this cleanser with the ANEW Advanced All In One Self Adjusting Perfecting Cream. The cream has a nice scent (no problems or allergic reactions to this product either) and it seems to make your skin look less dry and gives your skin a healthier texture. Both of these products are worth the price and I would suggest them to anyone who would like to give them a shot."
5,A wonderful intimate musical about healing and love.,"Violet is a musical theater piece about a young woman in the 1960's south searching for both physical and emotional healing. She boards a bus to visit a healing preacher in hopes he will make a scar on her face (from an accident as a child) disappear. The lives that she affects on the trip and the healing that takes place within her heart make this a unique and wonderful story. The cast is top-notch all around and the music and lyrics are original, interesting and melodic. Highly recommended. This show played Off-Broadway in 1998 and will have many regional productions soon."
5,Tesori shows remarkable promise,"I bought Violet on a lark (after reading favorable reviews). I couldn't be happier. This CD receives constant playtime and with good reason. Jeanine Tesori's score is so beautiful and appropriate that it's impossible to imagine it being pulled off by anyone else. As a first theatrical score, Tesori's Violet shows the arrival or another promising young composer. Let's hope Thoroughly Modern Millie brings that promise to fruition."
4,"""Honey in the Bushes lord and water in the well. . ."" Violet","This is a beautiful masterpiece of broadway style musical. The score is very original and gives a good sense of both time and era. The story is hard to get used when you first hear it, but it grows on you, if your looking for a new musical to pop in the car on the way to work I recomend this one. ""I say most things fall in line with the luck of the draw."" Violet"
4,In the beginning...,"It's nice to hear Jeanine Tesori's first major musical work. She is truly a chameleon, being able to write convincingly and movingly in a variety of styles (listen to this and thenCaroline, Or Change (2004 Original Broadway Cast)to see the point). Brian Crawley's lyrics are also excellent, and the cast is quite accomplished. Here's to hoping for another major production of this show sometime soon."
5,a WONDERFUL musical!,"This is a glorious, touching, sweet, bitter, above all, humane musical. I bought it on a whim, and I've listened to it at least 10 times over the past 5 days. Highly recommended."
5,"Violet on The Fringe (Edinburgh, Scotland)","My high school preformed Violet at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and every time I hear this CD it brings back those good times. I love this musical!"
2,Disappointing,"My kids (7 and 5) have other flavors of the Spongebob games and typically they have been able to play those games for weeks before they reach the end. We purchased the Creature from the Krusty Krab game thinking we would have similar results, but to my surprise they finished the entire game the first weekend they had it. It wasn't nearly challenging enough for a 5 year old."
2,mmmmmm.....no,"This game is for kids. Little little kids. They would enjoy it, and the fact that it is no challenge at all. Too bad, because i actually like the other SB games i've played."
4,Still a print problem,"The first volume had printing issues, and so does this one. Not as bad, or am I just used to it now? Still worth it, but I hope Book 3's quality is better."
4,This was what made being seven years old fun,"These collected works have given me back a piece of the spark of my youth... Each generation has had new influences and you will find that the men of era's prior to my generation have baseballs on their desktops or very very hot cars in their garages... My generation has vinyl records with usb record players, CD's and DVD's to the ceiling, espresso maker's, and sometimes their favorite comic collections on the bookshelf... Whatever the blast from the past is, you folks over at Amazon.com are going to have it for us if it exists at all... So I extend to you a Heart felt THANKS, cincerely MAT ENLOE ( your customer )"
4,"Great PSU, but....",This a great Power Supply. But careful of the cable length for your case. I installed this in a Cooler Master 690 case and found that some of the cables were lacking in length. Everything still hooked up fine but the extra length would have allowed me to do a better cable management inside the case. Don't know if anyone else had a problem with this.
5,"Quiet, Plenty of Power and modular...","Can't really go wrong with this guy 700W of power, runs very cool, SLI ready, and it's modular. I honestly could not have asked for more."
2,***Warning*** What a waste. Not a good brand name.,"Bought it to power a new rig I am building, it crapped out after 2 weeks. I had a spare 300watt power supply to test for issues with mobo and connectors, the spare worked ?!I wanted to give them a chance but blew 100 bucks. I can't get that back.Bought a Sparkle PSU, and it works like a charm and is stable as hell.Will not trust there brand again.Crosair, Sparkle, etc are the only quality brands."
3,He liked it!,i bought this book for my incarcarated friend he wanted some books to read i was glad i could find a reasonable price for them. It was shipped directly to him without a problem.
1,Speaking of idiots...,"Please do not expect to learn anything worthwhile from a grammar handbook written by an author who cannot identify his own usage errors! Although the book's index lists pages that address misplaced modifiers, the title itself contains this very mistake: there is no such thing as a pocket idiot. The word pocket is intended to describe the book, not its audience; therefore, the corrected title would read ""The Idiot's Pocket Guide to Grammar and Punctuation."" At first I thought that the title of this book was intended as a joke, but scanning the sample pages provided on Amazon, I found numerous other grammatical errors such as the plural pronoun ""they"" being used to replace the singular subject ""everyone."" I found five grammatical errors in just the opening section, but I won't bother to list them all. Buy a better grammar handbook, and then see if you can identify the author's mistakes yourself. I am stunned that this author acquired a PhD in English."
3,"OK Biscuits, slow shipping, plastic bag","Biscuits look typical of composition biscuits. Ordered 6/25 received 7/2, so shipping is slower than ideal. These are bulk packaged in non-resealable, light weight plastic baggies, so you will need an old mayo jar or coffee can to store."
1,This book is a piece of...,"You will not know what I mean untill you buy and use this book. It is not meant for first semester students as the review mentioned. It sucks...examples are so hard, and approach used in the book in so difficult to understand"
1,The [weakest] DVD I have ever seen,"If you buy this DVD, you would have been better off literally flushing your money down the [drain].Let me point out the bad things:1) there is not 1 second of any 50 cent song in the ENTIRE dvd2) there is not one word from 50 cent in ANY interview3) the DVD is not even about 50 cent4) the [people] they have talking on the documentary are so stupid, and their ""insights"" are so scripted, that its ridiculous.5) the video REPEATEDLY shows the same low quality JPGs (and I mean low quality) of 50 cent again and again and again while people talk.Let me point out the good things:1) the entire DVD is 35 mins long...., it is honestly the [weakest] DVD I have ever seen. ..."
1,this dvd blows!,"PLEASE ,I repeat PLEASE do not buy this dvd it is a less than nothing excuse to get money. Even the die hard 50 cent fan will regret buying this one!"
1,horrible,"The book was not in the condition as presented, extremely used and based on the description, it was not what I ordered. I needed to go re purchase a legible copy. I'm extremely upset-by this purchase and will not purchase in this manner again.(I only get taken onceIn my effort with contacting the company to get this resolved, It became a situation that the company felt if they wasted more of my time with attempting to appear as though they were helpful, I would go away and it worked (wasted way to much of my time and I hope they really did give the money to a person that needed it, and not some ripoff)."
4,Tyson film a must see for any sports fan,The film Tyson by James Toback is a must see film for any sports fan. Mike's Tyson's story has often been told by others. This is a front and center in you face account of Tyson talking Tyson. I can watch over and over again!
5,Insightful,"I found this to be revealing with regards to Mike Tyson's persona. What's happened to him is tragic. This film walks us through his life experience---told by the man himself---Mike Tyson. Very insightful as to why he is the way he is, what led to his rise as well as his downfall. Glad he is recovering now."
4,"Scary, Confused and Introspective","I was expecting the rantings of an illiterate thug, but actually found Tyson to be a fairly articulate and deeply introspective man. Despite his cruel upbringing and lack of formal education, he comes across as sympathetic in many respects, and the film clips of old but classic matches add to this film's entertainment value. Yes, Tyson can be scary and confused at times. But you will be fascinated by this candid biography and autobiography."
2,Improper Focus,"If one wants to know the psychology behind a complex and largely pathetic person like Mike Tyson, Mr. Tyson is probably the last individual you should consult. His is not an analytical or honest mind. The monologues that comprise the vast majority of the minutes taped for this documentary are endless and cannot be trusted. What I hoped for here was historical analysis and that is not what Tyson, the movie, offers. Ten minutes of interview with our subject would be profitable but ninety minutes is a waste of everyone's time. I suppose this endeavor is deemed artistic and poignant by critics, but I disagree with such a conclusion. A worm's eye view remains the view of a worm. This film was a serious disappointment."
2,Not what I expected.,"After looking at this taped interview. It really was almost like watching 60 minutes. Not a lot of past fights and good action hits from Mike. It was more about his personal life and what he went through as a child and those whom influenced him. This film really shows a lighter side of Iron Mike. It, to me, wasn't worth the price that was asked for it."
1,HBO Boxings 24/7 Series is 10X Better at Creating Documentaries,"Silly multiple frames make some scenes eerie, old footage that been seen a thosand times before, no real focal point, and all these things add up to a below average documentary. The people who make HBO's 24/7 should go into doing boxing documentaries because their production from video, to audio, to themes is solid compared to second rate documentaries like this ."
3,Good documentary I would have liked more,"I liked the information that we received out of this documentary however, I would have liked to hear more about his lifestyle while in the amateur ranks and his training throughout life; how it has evolved and progressed."
3,Interesting material but visually bland,"This is pretty much just a long sit-down interview with Tyson. I would liked to have seen something more visually interesting than Tyson sitting down in a living room and talking. That said, it was a damn good interview."
4,Insightful,"If you want to see another side of ""Iron Mike"" then watch this movie. His story will surprise you and you will see a side that I know I never thought existed. Its not propaganda to make you like him because he is finished in the boxing world and he cant act his way out of a paper bag. Its just a new view to let people see who he really is. Good watch, g;ad I bought it."
4,"Makita beam cutter saw blade - pricey, but effective","The saw blade that came with my Makita beam cutter turned out to be near worthless. It took a lot of effort to ""push it through"" a cut on a 4x8 beam. Out of the box, the blade heated up with the first cross cut, producing smoke. Not so with this 60 tooth carbide tipped blade. Although it is very expensive (as saw blades go) the results that I get with this blade are excellent. It makes a nice, clean, straight cut without producing any smoke - even in cutting green wood. The Makita beam cutter saw appears to be a little underpowered, so the blade doesn't exactly cross cut through a 4x8 beam like butter, but still the cutting rate is reasonable and the results are good. I have not tried any third-party saw blades on this saw to date."
2,"Makita 16"" saw blade",I was not real happy with this blade. It is not as thick as the original balde and therefore needs sharpening more often.
2,A Regrettable Buy,"I have a generic MP3 player, with which I jog. I needed an armband for it, and this was the only one I could find for a generic product. It is poorly designed, and comes loose easily. My MP3 player is a tight fit in the case, and I can't access many of the buttons, especially in the middle of a run. Mostly I stick it on shuffle repeat and hope the volume stays constant from song to song. I wish I hadn't bought it."
4,Good Quality -- Good Fit,"Bought two of these for new MP3 players for my boys. They're rugged, well made and fit as well as can be expected for a generic case."
5,simply amazing,"If you like music in this genre, ambient/post-rock, youll love this album. Its one of those rare albums that pulls the listner in andtakes them on a journey. Wonderful!"
1,by and so,"this innocuous namby-pamby non-sense could be filled with dare i say more substance. cut and paste a segment from each song on the album into one magnificent song. now, thats worthy of several stars. actually what am i saying, the first song is one of my favorites ever. the rest don't quite give off the same complete feeling. i guess after the first i just wanted to hear more with the remaining and thats just not the case. i'm adding some more stars right here. ***"
1,uncool,"It doesn't really matter what form or style you work in if your work is substantially vacant in terms of content. Emotionally, this music expresses the insipid--the bathetic, mawkish, middle-brow overly-sentimental Hallmark card feelings. It's like listening to a Mafiosi killer, drunk on cheap red, say, ""I love you!"" over and over, before he starts singing, ""Feelings, nothing but feelings...""Cheap feeling. Superficial feeling. Convenient feelings."
1,Won't buy again,"I'm not a vegetarian and consume most of my essential amino acids via meat... my wife doesn't eat very much meat/chicken and usually falls far short of her daily needs. My mission is to find a protein powder that has what she needs, tastes good to her, and isn't full of fat and sugar.Her opinion is...<drum roll>... This product has little or no peanut butter flavor and tastes chalky. She doesn't like it and so my search continues."
5,"Slim, Classy, Durable",A good quality product. Padded inside. Very slim and classy. Slips in and out of a pocket easily--doesn't bind like leather. Closes securely and opens easily. A few minor sharp edges that I will sand off with 220 grit paper. My wife has the Palm Plastic/Aluminum case--it is cheap looking compared to this and not nearly as protective in my opinion. I know I will be hard on this product and wanted to get the best protection I could find. I think I have found just that.
2,Scratched my stylus,"Well, it sure does look cool but the latch scratched the stylus of my Palm Vx as I was opening the case for the first time.In addition, getting the stylus out once the Palm is in place is awkward and frankly, I don't want to deal with it on a daily basis. Putting a little slot for the stylus on the outside would have made more sense.There's a very thin layer of foam inside but I'm quite skeptical of this case's ability to protect from falls or impact.In short, poor ergonomics, cool look. I'm returning mine."
5,The only palm case,"I have had mine for about 6 months. the bottom line is (IMHO) that this IS the best case for the palm v's. it is very tough and still slim enough to fit in my pocket.this puts the ""aluminum"" case by Palm to shame."
3,Is It Worth The Money?,"You're probably asking yourself, ""Is this case really worth about 80 bucks?"" That's exactly what I was thinking, so I ordered one to check it out.What I found was a very sturdy, all aluminum case that will most definitely protect your Palm V from extreme hard knocks. However, the padding is so thin I can't believe it would protect your Palm from a fall on a hard surface.Furthermore, the case has many sharp, unfinished corners and edges, and the design makes removing the stylus difficult without lifting the Palm slightly from the bottom half of the case. As with other hard cases, HotSyncing is a problem, but just move the cradle to the edge of your desk to allow the case to hang over the edge.Yes, it does offer protection, but I was expecting a lot better fit and finish for my money. If your Palm lives in an environment that is harsh, like the bottom of a toolbox, this is the case for you. Otherwise, buy the ""Palm"" hard case and spend the difference on books and CDs here."
2,A Month in Front of the TV,"Attempting to add up the meagre elements that enabled me to endure this, I came up with only two: the Lake Como scenery and the fact that Uma Thurman looked very pretty. Vanessa Regrave was her invariably annoying self; Edward Fox was appropriately dreadful as a hopelessly dreadful male lead. The motivations of the characters covered the full range of silliness, desperation, repressed lust, cynicism, opportunism and meaness, none of them conveyed with either style or conviction. With all of that going for (or against) it, ""A Month at the Lake"" still managed to be remarkably slow-paced and boring."
2,Nice Scenery,"The acting and screen-play are poor, but the scenery, and the cinematography that captures it, are beautiful.I would suggest Enchanted April instead."
3,A disappointment,"Gorgeous scenery and a terrific cast, but, in my opinion, a somewhat contrived plot with forced dialogue and poor direction."
1,oh so boring,92 minutes felt like 3 hours - boring and not at all humerous. Lost my attention with in the first 20 minutes.
2,"Poor plot, but really poor quality picture","The plot is unrealistic and rather poorlly executed. Acting was strictly mediocre with the sole exception of Vanessa Redgrave who played the older woman very well; if not for her I would have given this 1 star. Although the DVD was new and appeared to be in genuine factory packaging, the picture quality was more like a VHS copied to a DVD even though played from an Oppo BD-95 player into a Panasonic VT50, which superbly delivers everything any disc has to offer."
3,A bit disappointing,"I try to see every movie ever filmed in Italy so that's why I bought this. And indeed it did have some scenery from Lake Como, but most was filmed just around the hotel where the story mostly took place. Although Vanessa Redgrave is lovely, I felt it was a bit self-serving and the story lacked credence, particulary when the very handsome young Italian was interested in her. And I just had no tolerance whatever for the character played by Edward Fox. Perhaps I'm just seeing this story through 21st century eyes and not 1930's sentimentalities."
2,Month By the Lake,"This is an okay movie. The scenery is beautiful, but the story line is just okay. I think they tried too hard to make another ""Tea With Mussolini,"" but it didn't work. The actors did a fine job, but Edward Fox just didn't cut a romantic figure for me."
2,story going nowhere....,"I was encouraged to see this movie as a prelude to me and my wifes trip to Como. And rightly so, the scenary is nice (not magnificent) and true. It looks like all scenes, including indors, are filmed at location.But the story and the acting suites as an afternoon tv movie at best. Specially Uma Thurman looks like overplaying every scene."
2,A month was too long,"This movie did not do anything for me, unless causing irritation counts. I love Vanessa Redgrave and all things Italian, especially the beautiful scenery. But even they couldn't save the day, especially since I didn't care for Ms. Redgrave's role in this. She can do much better. I felt the movie was shallow and not very well scripted. I didn't bother to finish watching to see what happened to the characters at the end, because frankly, my dear, I didn't give a -----."
4,Sweet,"This is a sweet movie, great for a rainy afternoon or a quite night. Vanessa Redgrave is always worth watching..."
3,Not so Foxy Mr. Fox,"I agree with prior reviews praising many aspects of this film but join with the few who found Edward Fox unconvincing as the romantic interest. How right on was the nanny in protesting ""you must be joking"". My apologies to Mr. Fox, but I found him so profoundly unappealing that the whole film didn't work for me. When Redgrave and Fox embrace at the end, all I could think was ""eeewww"" . With Redgrave's character so happy and eager, she was going to have a rough future with the dour and homely Fox, despite his interesting ears."
4,Love is NOT just for the young...,This subtle and beautiful film was delightful. Vanessa Redgrave and Edward Fox were charming and proved that love can find you at any age.
5,Mickey Mouse 35mm film,"It's Mickey and a collectible, look but you can't touch. A great addition to any collectors... well... collection."
3,OK textbook,Had not input in selecting this as a textbook in my son's school. It is heavy (physically) and makes no sense to carry to school back and forth. so you need one at home...
3,Help for Grandson,"I purchased this book to help my grandson with his math. However, he was transferred to a different class so I returned the book unopened."
5,Great For Work Boots,I was very pleased with my purchase. The only thing that I was a little disappointed in was it took a little long for the shipping.
1,Equivalent to Donkey Dung,"Being a multiple myself and knowing a--forgive the pun--host of others, I must say that this is one of those books that gives a bad name to our community. This woman was not only socially and legally irresponsible, but down right nutty. Personally, I think whoever diagnosed her as multiple did her a grave diservice. The woman seemed more likely schitzophrenic to me. And UGH! It was terribly written!"
5,Buddhism for Beginners,"I was raised a Buddhist, but discovered from this book that I know more about Buddhism than I thought I did. I love the simplicity of the teachings in this book. I brought this book to Moab, Utah and found it the perfect book to read and reflect upon in that setting. This book made me think more about being a better person, a better Buddhist, and more peaceful. I've since given this book as gifts to two other people since the lectures don't just apply to Buddhists, but are universal to humans attempting to live in peace."
4,just the message please,"I loved the intro and the first few pages....Then, the book became an education instead of the sweet collection of anecdotal ideas it started out to be. For me, there's just too much about Dharma and such. I love the ideas, but not the feeling I'm supposed to be learning....being compelled to become a follower.Maybe in time, but not for now."
4,Being Peace,Ghandi once said - you must become what you want the world to be. This is another great book by Thich Nhat Hahn.
3,A disappointed admirer,"Firstly, I am an admirer of Thich Nhat Hanh his The Miracle of Mindfulness particularly. I found this work long on words and short on teachings. Master Hanh has much to offer the world and I would suggest his other writings, perhaps beginning with The Miracle of Mindfulness or Anger. His call for peacemakers in this book is no less urgent than it was nearly a quarter century ago when he wrote. Being peace is his achievement."
4,Great reading for beginners in Buddhism,"I was looking for Buddhist writings that were down to earth and relevant to modern Western lifestyle. Being Peace and Touching Peace are just that. They are simple, approachable, and meaningful. I was instantly able to apply what I learned and my practice is better for it."
4,Essential early TNH.,Let me start by saying I have deep respect for Thich Nhat Hanh and don't begrudge him the profits from any of his vast number of books. That said some of his later work is pretty watered down and comes of as hippy-dippy.This book is just the opposite. Having read Anger and Teachings On Love I was really looking for something that got to the core of the man's teachings and this book does without wasting ink or time.If you're interested in mindfulness this is the volume for you.
5,Excellent Book - Changed My Life,"This book truly opened up a whole new world for me, and gave me a new profound view of life in general. I truly recommend this book to anyone looking for some spiritual guidance."
1,a disapointment,I read this book hoping to be empowered by a transgender rights leader. Rikki Wilchins is the founder and president of Gender pac. The book was a total disapointment. Wilchin's bio was not moving at all. The book was filled with graphic sex talk about Wilchin's artifical vagina. She talks about workshops where biological women touch her genitals. The book is vulgar and could make more people have hatred for the transgenderd. A total waste of time.
4,headphone accessories,"The deco pack is a set of split beads to attach to the single-strand portion of headphone wire. The earrings attach to the Barbie Girls earbud and the penguin charm attaches to the Barbie Girls front plate like a pet on a leash. The package is headphone ""bling"".Our daughter wanted this penguin set and likes it. We haven't tried removing the beads from the wire yet, but didn't have any problem opening them initially and attaching them. None of them have fallen off either. Two of the beads were malformed so wouldn't work out of the package, but there were plenty to decorate as she wanted."
4,Un must para una fashion girl :),"Mi nena queria el set por el pinguino que se coloca a la barbie y queda como una mascotita.Las cuentas (de plastico) sirven para decorar el cable del auricular y queda realmente lindo, sus colores, despues de 6 meses, siguen intactos.Se debe tener cuidado porque si se guarda en un bolson con otros objetos las cuentas tienden a caerse pero se puede volver a colocarlas siempre que se tengan ambas mitades.Tambien viene un par de aros que se le coloca al auricular y simula que la nena los esta usando.Es RE fashion :)"
4,Nice way to cook,No more melting spatulas! Love the colors (easy to remember which size is which) and the way they work!
4,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006,"I am having great pleasure using our Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006. It's very easy to use even if your a novice. I would highly recommend this product to your customers. If there is a downfall to this product, I would have like to have more music and sounds when putting an e-card together.I can hardly wait when the next version comes out and see if any changes.Thank you,Charles"
4,My first card software purchase,This is a good product. My only complant is that you have to adjust the wording on almost every card to print correctly...maybe its user error...otherwise I like it.
5,great support,I received this program right before Halloween. I was struggling with the program at first. I called tech support and they walked me through using the software. They were patient and helpful I am now making cards like a pro. Go Creative Home!!
2,a few problems,"There are 2 reasons I am dissapointed with this software.First: After entering 116 names, addresses, phone numbers, Birthdays, I printed a copy of my address book and found that the print font was so small that I needed a magnifying glass to read. The printed list will serve no purpose if you want to use it for a quick reference at a glance. After talking to their tech I was told that there is no way to change this.Also the program will not let you ""start from scratch"". In other words you can't make your own card using their clip art easily."
1,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006,Disappointed with the clip art. Old fashioned. Choice of cards not what I expected. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
1,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006,"Very dissapointed, If you have the 2004 version don't waste your money on this one."
1,Didnt Receive Item,We did not receive the item and didn't mention the reason for the refusal to mail the program. The only method we notice the transaction had been credited to our account. This accured weeks after the expected delivery date. This was quite unacceptable.
5,Greeting cards software,"I bought this software as a gift for my wife. A smart buy! If you or any friend enjoys making their own greeting cards, buy this. It's great! --Kennth Whitman"
5,Hallmark Card Program 2006,I am very happy with the program. This program has a nice selection of cards. I like the fact that I am able to Email cards with this program. I also like not having to insert a cd each time I use the program. It is installed on the computer and I just to click on the icon to bring it up.
4,hallmark card studio 2006 delux,"easy to install,good customer service from the toll free number and easy to use.better than older versions"
5,Very creative!,I love the new option of sending a card that I personally made through email! This software is SO easy to use and makes quality cards for every occasion.
1,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT,I have not received this product and I ordered it 12/19/08. WIll not use this seller again.
5,Champions of Faith Review,This is a fabulous video! Major figures in baseball describe how their lives are enriched by living their faith. I bought this video to show the boy's youth group at my parish. I recommend it to anyone who wants to help young people (as well as older folks) form a strong faith connection. Champions of faith is a great video that counters the rhetoric that works to eliminate matters of faith from everyday life. This video has my highest recommendation.
4,Look for the forest beyond the trees.,"I found this movie to be very uplifting. It isn't just about a girl learning to fly or about her romance on ship board, although those things are elements of the film. It is a message to everyone that in order to live and move forward in life one must let go of the past. One needs to let go of one's fears, and one needs to love regardless of social convention, race, orientation, etc. While the plot did have a lot of angles, it was tied up nicely by the end, and I felt overall it was a film worth watching."
3,Need to do this one again with a more contemporary slant.,Good job by the veteran actors but the new actor fell short of believability. )If that is a word.) Give the guy a gal we can believe he would fall for--there are plenty of Jamaican cuties to choose from--can probably act at least as well.
2,Dead after 8 months of light use...,"I've been a loyal Canon user for years, but a friend recommended this camera, and based on the image quality he's getting, I purchased it. It was indeed a good camera, until the flash went out, and finally the camera is just dead. I've been trying to get Nikon to fix it, but no luck so far.Further, the camera has no viewfinder, only the screen on the back, which is somewhat useless in bright daylight."
5,Nikon Coolpix P4 8MP Dgital Camera,I found this camera very easy to use and the photos come out clear with good qualty. I have yet to explore all the extra added modes and features but I have been very happy with it so far. Would recommend it.
2,Great Camera with 1 missing option,I have taken more than 500 pictures with this camera and am very satisfied with it.One thing would make it 5 star perfect. That's the addition of a range finder. It is difficult to frame pictures in bright sun light without it.
3,Too fat,"I purchased the camera about a year ago. The photographs are just okay. Unfortunately, the body of the camera is fat and difficult to get in and out of your pocket or camera case. If you like carrying around a camera in your pocket for quick shots, this camera is not for you."
1,a big let down,"My seller, I chose, stated this came with 3 - 15 watt tubes and an aluminum reflector. Both of which was false. It did come with one tube which looks used by the darkness on both ends of the tube. The ""reflector"" is a piece of white plastic which my current one has. Over time, this plastic becomes very brittle and pieces have actually fell into the water. I guess they don't make quality like they use to."
2,Hmmmm....,"SOOO disappointing! I had such high hopes for it because I love Vol. 1 SOOO much, but alas! No bueno!"
4,hidden gem,"This Wet Willie recording came along after several excellent studio recordings. While not quite as strong as Dixie Rock or The Wetter the Better, the guys more than proved their ability to wander out of the studio and jam. They were definetly not your average southern rock band. No No No and Teaser which were staples from the Wetter lp still sound fresh and Grits Ain't Groceries was much funkier than other well known white soulsters. Everything That You Do is one song that never got its due although this overblown live version is not nearly as good as the studio version. This would certainly be a good overview for someone just discovering this band. Now if they will just release Mannorisms."
5,one of the best,"At the time of writing, I'm shocked to see that this classic album is out of print, and going for absurd sums of money. A great album, but there is no need to pay outrageous prices for it. That said, this is, in my opinion, one of the best live albums ever. Wet Willie put on an absolutely smokin' performance. Tight, funky band as always, and lead singer Jimmy Hall is in prime form, belting out the soulful and bluesy songs. I owned this on album back in the day, but I'm thankful the CD finally came out, with a bunch of bonus tracks to boot. Good job guys. Now someone bring this gem back in print!"
2,Not that Great,"I am a proffesional roofer and after reading the great reviews i decided to get one of these and see how nice it actually was. Very dissapointing the only + is that it can pull nails which is way slower than useing your hammer. There is about 5 guys total that work with me and this is the only fork that is left in the trailor everyday. The ProShingle D grip fiberglass fork seems to work better, atleast at pulling nails. If you know what your doing the good old fashion fork in my opinion is the way to go. Costs about $10 and will last years, compared to $65 and it just sits in the trailor."
5,House Rabbit Care,Provides good overview to basic house rabbit care. A great book for first time bunny owners looking for info.
1,New and Improved Recipe anything BUT improved.,"I have been eating this stuff since the '70s or shall I say HAD been. They now only have the New and Improved Recipe which is terrible! I thought it went bad-- then I see on the box, new and improved. Who approved this. Anyone remember New Coke--- well, I see this happening again only with Quaker, Inc. I will no longer buy this stuff until they go back to the old recipe."
4,Mustela Massage Oil,"I've been using Mustela on my dry/temperamental skin (I'm 26 years old) for a few months now and I noticed a huge improvement! I love this product. The massage oil helps lock in moisture so much better than Johnson's baby oil and its not as greasy. It also smells great, and the scent isn't overpowering but it fades after a couple of hours. I use the oil first and after it dries I put on the mustela hydra bebe lotion. Works very well, I highly recommend it even for adult use!"
4,Scent is strong,"I love the packaging, it's easy to control the amount you're using. I love the product - nice feel & glide without ending up greasy. However, the scent is strong, somewhat akin to baby powder. If you are looking for a low or unscented product, I would avoid this one."
5,Smells very nice!,I love all mustela products. This message oil is not greasy a all and absorbs into baby skin very quickly.
4,Entertaining and Thought Provoking,"I enjoyed this book very much. I had read the Cairo Trilogy a short time before. As I started this book I wondered if I might not enjoy it because of having just read over 1000 pages of Mahfouz. I needn't have worried. B&E was a totally different story but in wonderfully similar setting and style. I kept thinking that it was almost a photographic negative of the Trilogy. I enjoyed it more having just read the 3 books, as I contrasted the family of Kamel Ali with the family of Abd al-Jawad. Good book."
5,Macintosh...The Naked Truth,"This book is great! I love this book! I couldn't stop reading until end of the book.This is great for Mac users who are living in ""PC city"" that it seems that no one else uses Mac but you. This book tells you what it is like to be Mac user in a Windows world and how to deal with PC-Weeines.Recommand to buy this book!!!!"
2,Outdated and not really funny,"I'm a 20 year Apple user (yes, even before the mac came along), a Kelby fan of most of his works, but this one is gotten old too fast. Most of the stuff he writes about is from way back when macs were years ahead of the windows machines, and that is no longer the case, macs are still so much better yes, but is not black and white anymore. I personally don't find his style funny at all, I find it like he's trying too hard to be funny, too simplistic sense of humour I'd say. Some stuff he says is still true today and there are some things even usefull, but that's about it."
1,Whiny and disappointing,"I've been a diehard Mac devotee since the mid-80's, and this book was definitely a turnoff. It felt like it was the same whiny magazine column printed over and over (in large type) with slight variations. I agree with another reviewer that Kelby's goofiness and overuse of hyperbole got old quickly. There were typos everywhere. I had to force myself to finish it.A big disappointment."
1,Scott Kelby is no Dave Barry,"This book is very low on content...it is *supposed* to be humorous.Unfortunately, the book isn't funny. The best part is chapter 6, CompUSA:Your Own Private Hell. It is the only amusing part of the book. The rest of it is really stupid.Don't waste your money on this book."
5,Captures the essence ...,"Scott Kelby has finally brought to light what it is to be a real Mac person.The humor and wit in the book make it a hilarious read. I first started reading it in a Cr@cker B@rrel restaurant. After almost every paragraph, I'd have to show my wife what I was laughing so hard about. We got quite a few nasty looks from the people around us."
5,This guy knows Mac. You guys should get it.,"This guy obviously knows how us Mac folks think. I mean just by looking at the title it's a dead giveaway that it must be a Mac book by a Mac guy.Delve into the book, and you'll see every nook and cranny of this book typifies at least one Mac user. I've been suprised to see a virtually complete clone of myself in this book - because all of my virtues (or most, anyway) are described in the book.There could be more 'bashing' at Windows XP, and the book certainly could have been a lot longer. But this book is a proud effort. It's stashed with Mac character throughout all its pages.Do your Mac friends a favour: buy a stack of these books for Christmas, and hand them to all of your Mac friends. This is the true Macintosh spirit - in print!"
5,Much needed Mac ammo,"The book includes most if not all the senseless arguments of what PC users, rather: ill-informed PC users, often say about the Mac. Kelby comes up with clever and accurate metaphores, and at the same time goes back in history and why it is that computer makers with an enormous market share have gone out of business, but not Apple. It's written in a light and funny tone, and contains serious truths. Highly recommended for any Mac user. Sure, PC users can or should read it too, but be prepared for the revelation of the best kept secret in the computing world."
3,Top falls off sometimes,"These are fine, but beware! The tops fall off sometimes, usually if you are working with something really stiff, like a thick batter! I own several and maybe my tops wouldn't fall off if I never put them in the dishwasher, which I have. I like the bright red color which goes with my kitchen."
4,Here's the correct link for the manual,"For those of you having trouble with the Gold edition and who want a manual, a previous reviewer noted that the link doesn't work. So do this:www.aspyr.comThen choose PC games from the drop down box. You will see a graphic for Europa 1400. Click on that. In the text box to the right of the next screen you will see a link to download the manual(s) in .pdf format.Steep learning curve on this but fun once you get into it. For those who really liked Europa Universalis's depth, this has as much, although it's a curious mix of first person and strategy.So far, me likely."
2,No manual! You've got to be kidding!,"This game has a lot of promise. It has really inovative game play, somewhere in between an rpg and a city builder. The problem is, I haven't been able to get beyond the survival gameplay aspects, in this game because...IT DOES NOT COME WITH A MANUAL, AND THE TUTORIAL IS WORTHLESS!Yes, that's right. And believe me, a game like this is far from self-explanitory. Even after struggling around with it for days, I still have no idea how to play. The quickstart guide that comes with it gives a link to a pdf version of the manual, but the file doesn't work, and there are virtually no FAQs on the internet about the game.So I've about had it with this version of Europa. Don't buy it unless you know you can somehow find an illusive full manual. I couldn't."
2,Too Autobiographical to be useful,"While I enjoy & appreciate Robert Ringer's style of writing and his no-nonsense view of life, I feel that ""To Be or Not To Be Intimadated"" is too autobiographical to be used as a reference book to be read over and over again (which was my purpose in buying it). I felt that the book was heavy on antecdotes and light on practical principles and motivation. The author failed to show how his examples could be used in life outside of the real estate business.For business motivation I much prefer Brian Tracy's works. His books are organized, well written and universal across the board; for all sectors."
2,Just OK,I tried to read this but just couldn't get into it. Maybe if I were a real estate agent or enthusiast I would have gotten more out of it.
4,Winning Through Not Being Intimidated,"I admit I prefer the original book and the original provocative title (and the original tortoise cartoons). Over the years, Ringer has had to fend off misunderstandings derived more from the humorlessness and literalism of critics than any great lapses in the book. I'd have been happier with just a new afterword responding to critics. Still, some of the rewordings and additions of this edition are of interest, and Ringer fans should look at both books. (I do wonder why he leaves intact an anecdote about a ruthless lender who knows that the borrower from whom he has just extracted a slew of concessions on the terms of a loan agreement is already in default as soon as he signs that agreement.) I'm going to be really annoyed if a new version of Looking Out For #1 comes out entitled Looking Out for Yourself While Also Being Considerate of and Respectful Toward Others."
4,A fun story and wisdom you can use!,"I read ""To Be Or Not To Be Intimidated?"" at the urging of marketing guru, Dan Kennedy. I have also purchased the audio book. Needless to say I'd highly recommend this book. Here's why...If you are in business you come across the kind of people that Ringer describes almost daily. Ringer gives you the tools and knowledge to spot and deal with the ""intimidators.""Mike D."
3,WHAT IS REALITY?,"REALITY IS the way things are/ they way most people view a thing. Life is painful, so most ignore reality. Live in reality and prosper from your dreams."
1,Try Full Garbage,"The Olsten twins were just plain annoying, as was the whole cast.I guess acting skills were not on the job requirements.The only possitive thing to say about this series is that it made the daytime soaps look good."
5,Family Fun,I just love this show. This is a show that any family with children would like. With each episode a lesson is learned. There is no violence or unappropriate words. All in all a great family show.
3,no-seeum,Was purchased as gift for young grandchild who watches the TV program. I have never seen it nor have any ideas about it.
3,Sound vs. Lyrics,"Pat Mcgee has a great ""acoustic songwriter"" sound. However, I was pretty disappointed with the sappy love song lyrics with no depth (which every song on this CD was a love song). I thought with such a soothing sound and so much talent on the guitar that the words would have a little more stregnth behind them. If you are a music fan that prefers sound over lyrics or are a ""sucker"" for sappy love songs, than I definately reccomend this CD. But if you are a fan that needs both aspects of the song, like I do, than I'm telling you to keep your money."
5,I love Pat,Pat McGee is an AWESOME musician! He was my swim coach and this is what he really wanted. I am so excited that he is making it and I knew he could do it! Get the CD and all of his others cause you will love it once you hear his CD once.
4,Early organic-electro apex,"4 1/2Only the tiniest bit awash in dated bleepings, this brilliantly flowing analog bubblebath-ed synthesis of innovative ambiance and forward propulsion is still one most definitely worth hearing, and the rare double-disc journey whose fillers are even thrillers."
4,"good stuff, but takes a while to get into","if you are looking for something different, check out FSOLs ""Lifeforms."" When I first got it, I really couldn't get into it, except for ""Cascade,"" which by the way, is the only real 'song' on the album. If you stick with it, it will begin to grow on you. I swear, this album sounds ALIVE!"
2,Better Choice for Beginners,"I have this record, listened to it several times, but I always end up taking it off - bored. Lots of creativity but not alot of coherence. FSOL's ""Papua New Guinea"" will give you a much, much better idea of what these guys are capable of - a classic. But - check out the masterpiece - ""Orb's Blue Room"" on ""UFO Orb"" - both the 17 min. ver. & the 40 min. ver. if possible. I still find this beautiful & powerful - lots of musicianship & creativity and an amazing sense of overall flow and structure."
5,if Pink Floyd would have made ambient techno,This album is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I'm tired of listening to techno that doesn't convey an image when you listen to it. If you like to let your imagination roam with the help of good electronica then Lifeforms is for you. Like 'Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd this music allows for introspection and reflection . This to me outdoes The Orb or Aphex Twin by a mile. Although it might not be melodious 100% of the time it still conveys emotion through its thought out production. This is a must for any die hard ambient or idm fanatic.
1,Ummm.. what?,"Okay.. This album was recommended to me by a sales clerk when I told him that I had enjoyed FSOLs work on ""Papua New Guinea"" and ""We have explosive"". Boy, was he off-course. As much as I tried, I just couldn't get into this album. I sat with the lights off, burning candles, doing yoga, etc. and all I could think was.. whatever. It doesn't seem that FSOL put any thought into this album whatsoever. It consists of randomness and not much else. Frankly, if I could return this cd, I would. I don't recommend this to anyone that enjoys structured music, or who likes rhythm: this album will drive you mad. =)"
3,simple-minded,"Alright, I've been a long time fan of FSOL, and I love them. I bought Lifeforms from my friend for seven bucks, who is also a FSOL fan, and I can understand why he wanted to sell it. This is far below FSOL's standards.The first CD is just for listening to. That's all you can pretty much do. Listen to it. The first CD I rate as two stars, saved by a miserable one star by the Lifeforms song, which is the only REAL song in the CD.The second CD is better, but not great. It has some more song-ish songs to it, like Omnipresence. I think the second CD deserves a four-star rating, averaging the intire thing out to 3 stars. Accelerator is the best FSOL CD available. If you like ambiant music, get Amorphous Androgynous."
4,The Future is sometime around now.....maybe sooner,"I just finished a review of Global Communication, so this is pretty much a repeat. I am a composer/arranger/performer working on a project of primarily electronic music based on Roman & Greek myths. This group does a great job of creating soundscapes. I've heard several of their tracks on PBS ( Hearts Of Space/Echoes ), & this is one reason I decided to get one of the CD's. I do recommend this CD but with the same caveat as Global Communication: great background/soundscapes but little presence of the musicians, as in the lack of lead or melodic lines that are not samples repeated over & over. A good CD, & I do recommend buying it."
5,A Masterpiece of Ambient Structure (or the Lack Thereof),"An album as pioneering as this is indeed a rare phenemenon. It pushes the current boundaries of sonic architecture by taking music out of the format of a ""song,"" and makes it just music. This is definetely the difinitve ambient album, the only ""trance"" album that truly lives up to the name of the genre."
4,Lifeforms review,"This CD is great. Very broad, and a great representation of FSOL. My copy of the CD came in the mail, and upon opening it the case literally fell apart into pieces. This would be a problem except for the fact that the CD was too good to return! Great dual CD. Great Purchase."
4,a 19th century morality story in novel format,"The Last von Reckenburg is a novel written by Louise von Francois, a now obscure 19th century German novelist. It is full of the characters you would expect, as well as the class prejudices, socio-economic structures, and societal restrictions of the period. And...a bit (quite a bit, at times, actually) of Christian morality. The plot has a few twists, and the characters are interesting overall, though some are not as developed as they might have been. The story moves along slowly, and drags a bit in places, but, even with the predictable ending, it is worth a read if you care for the literature of this period and locale. I find Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's novels better written, but those of Ms. von Francois are also interesting."
3,What Happened?,"I have read two of DeLint's collections: Dreams Underfoot and Moonlight and Vines. I absolutely loved Dreams Underfoot, and couldn't wait to read more--but this book disappointed me. The stories are too repetitious, and most of them don't stand up to DeLint's usual standard of quality (or what I assume his standard is; I've only read two of his books, after all). However, there are a few real gems in here, my favorite being the one about Pandora's Box (I'd give you the name, but I can't find my copy). I recommend this book only for serious fans of DeLint. Everyone else should read Dreams Underfoot first (and ignore the stupis cover design)."
2,Too much abuse/too little magic,What happened between DREAMS UNDERFOOT and MOONLIGHT AND VINES?--the abuse that was so prevalent in IVORY AND HORN has taken over completely. It seems in Newford the only way to discover the magic now is to come from such a crippled and abused background that you can't function in this world anymore. All the stories devolve into subject of the year abuse stories with hints that magic acts as only as a counselor. Add to that mix the titillation of lesbianism from half the stories and one has to wonder where this is going? The magic left Newford because it couldn't take the pain and neither could I.
2,Not nearly as good as De Lint's usual,"This collection of short stories just doesn't compare to what Mr. De Lint is capable of. There are a handful of decent stories here, but no gems, and quite a bit of forgettable fare. Unless you're a truly serious fan of his, don't buy this. To know what he can do, check out Trader or Someplace to be Flying for longer fiction, or Dreams Underfoot for better short stories. Just stay clear of this book as a starter."
4,A nice collection of short stories,"I was first introduced to Charles De Lint's short stories in other anthologies, and that spurred me to find one of his collections. The stories are well-crafted and introspective, although the author occasionally becomes a bit heavy-handed in getting his themes across. ""Saskia,"" ""The Big Sky,"" and ""Held Safe by Moonlight and Vines"" are memorable pieces in this anthology. _Moonlight and Vines_ is the first book I've ever read by this author, but I will go searching for others."
5,The Magic in All of Us,"Having been a De Lint fan for many years now, I found this collection to be just what I had been looking for in his previous works. The masterful blend of reality and the fantasic brings us back to a time when the veil between the mundane and the mystical seemed just a little bit thinner, when we could accept the mysteries of life and of magic without the desperate need to catorgorize them, file them away, and forget them. This novel seems to have a slightly darker feel than the others, incorporating lifestyles and beliefs just a shade outside of our own and letting us borrow them for a while, walk in their steps, and see through their eyes. The incorporation of the political overtones to his work serve as a poignant reminder of our responsiblity to the victims of our society. Overall, this book is a lovely collection which can be taken either as simply a charming set of stories, or as a well phrased wake up call to the issues we all face, directly or just as observers."
4,PCT lessons learned,"I read Ray Jardine's PCT handbook after a grueling California hike. Some of his methods have helped me lighten my load and actually increase my safety solo in the backcountry. Not all of his methods are transferable to every region or every season. Other hiking books and magazines market the lastest in expensive outdoor gear. Reading Ray makes the overnight hiker question the need for costly purchases in the latest in high-tech gear to simply go hiking. Again, I plan to adapt only the methods/materials that still allow me to be safety consicious of the climate and region I will be hiking in."
4,It works Great,"If you need to step down in the DC system, which is recommended, this works great. The ends are to size stated, the hose fit easily and the wire clamps put it all together snuggly. The fitting allows you to step down from a larger main line to smaller branch lines near the machine, thus increasing the air suction, where it's needed most, by the machine"
5,The Ceremony of Initiation - Cornerstone Edition W.L. Wilmshurst,"It is a book that every Freemason should have and read more than once. For non-Masons, this book will give you a clear idea of why Freemasonry, Century after Century is still a magnet attracting new Members and keeping old Members. W.L. Wilmshurst's books are all ""classics textbooks"" about the spirituality which is so pervasive in all Ceremonies and Rituals of Freemasonry."
4,Interesting read on the process of initiation,"While it is geared towards Masonic initiation and uses that as an example, it helps to explain the initiation process for many institutions. It also helps those who have or are going to become Masons, understand more deeply the spiritual aspects of initiation."
3,A hard boiled well plotted mystery with unlikable characters,This is the first Thomas Black mystery I read. The book is well plotted and reads fast. The action scenes are hardboiled. I almost gave this four stars but I didn't really like any of the characters. Would it have killed the author to put in at least one normal character and some normal human emotions. Perhaps Seattle has an unusually high percentage of mentally ill and/or deranged people but I doubt it. On page 1 Black's dog is killed. Black doesn't shed a tear but rather he gives us a gardening tip--plant roses over a dog's grave--what's with that?
5,Ratheer Hood,"This is a great movie, I really enjoyed watching it so I gave it a 5 star rating. The price was right also for it. I'm really glad I bought it."
2,How good the movie,I seen this movie on saturday the 24 2002. This movie is soo good by the acting. There's pretty alot of action in this flick and pretty funny too. patrick swanye play a good role with his kids. They deathly need a dvd version of this movie I want it soo bad it would be a better picture. They should been create this movie on dvd too bad it's not on dvd yet. maybe this year or next year to be on dvd cause the dvd makers need to bring this out fast it's a real good movie maybe someday i have on dvd when it come out I be real sice.
3,Funny Stuff,"I've seen most of Patrick Swayze's movies and I really enjoy his characters. However, they're usually kind of serious and intense, with a rather ""cool"" quality. I never imagined him being manic and funny--the exact opposite of most of his more well-known characters. Well, to my surprise, he was terrific. The script has some gaping holes, but Swayze's portrayal of Jack Charles is a totally enjoyable experience. Anyone who is a Swayze fan will enjoy this movie (which even contains a tiny segment of him dancing in front of a mirror)."
4,Still Funny After All These Years,"What can I say, I get a kick out of this movie. Yeah it is absurd in some ways and the story is somewhat predictable, if you like the ""Smoky and the Bandit"" style you will like this. It stars Patrick Swayze as a tough convict who kidnapps his own kids from a dasterdly Foster Care Center in rout to ""The Big Final Score"" and then the mayhem begins. Also in the cast is a young Halle Berry as a newspaper writer trying to help Swayze, Sabrina Lloyd (Sliders), and Brian Bonsell (Whose The Boss) as the unrully kids. There is plenty of car chases, twists and turns, and laughs as this old school cross country chase movie from 1993."
2,Signtaure Diva live,There is no doubting Chaka Khan has a fantastic voice but I feel this concert on dvd leaves the fan a bit short.Only six songs and alot lacking in energy and excitement.Extra footage on the dvd has been sourced from old vhs tapes complete with line dropout.Bits of the concert that should be on this dvd are shown on the extra footage and this is what the fans deserve to see.Due to the lack of material on these soul superstars fans have to buy only what is available.My advise is to wait untill the real 1980s concert becomes availble and then we can see Chaka in all her glory.
2,Insuffient for a brilliant vocalist,"This was at a time when Chaka Khan had begun to have throat problems. Having seen Chaka perform many times, with and without Rufus and I have never heard her this strained for notes where it would normally seem effortless. Of all the footage that could have been shown to portray the signature diva there sure didn't seem to be much thought put into the footage that would represent her true artistry. Compare her 20th century women DVD or even the BET live footage and you can see a dramatic difference. Although, it's not terrible, the whole concert is short and just not felt. I've waited for some time to hear/see her older hits, minus all jazz, being put to DVD, but I was greatly disappointed because many a time I've seen and heard better."
5,great tamagotchis,I just got my tamagotchi last week and my cousin couldnt stop holding it. He fed and played with it everytime.It got sick every minute because my cousin kept feeding him.One day my cousin had wet hands and touched my tamagotchi toy.It died for a week I had to get it fixed.I wish you made the tamagotchi V4 waterproof.
5,I can't get enough of Justin Timberlake,"I'm obsessed with Justin Timberlake. What he did to Britney was kinda messed up, but I think he's the greatest singer that has ever lived. His artistic creativity is without limits. The dawg can do anything! This is a really great DVD collection of all his music videos. If this DVD were any hotter, you could fry a southwestern omlette on it. Go, JT, go!!"
1,Music for Sissy's,"Justin Timberlake is a chickenhead doing a 3rd rate Michael Jackson impression!!!Folks, it doesn't get any worse than this!He is the future Corey Feldman."
4,Well worth it,"I am a big fan of ""Mr JT"" and snapped this off the shelf as soon as it was released. I was pleased that there were a few extras, in particular MTV's Making the Video and the MTV Launch of Justified was really interesting. My only beef with this DVD was that it should have inlcuded the full versions of Making the Video, Launch and the BRIT award performance. Also I did think there were too many live performances of the same song (Like I Love You & Cry Me A River). I wouldve like to have seen a live performance of Rock Your Body or Senorita. But overall I was extremely pleased with the DVD... he is a very talented artist and I look forward to any future projects he has going.PS - I absolutely LOVE the new song, Im Lovin It!! And the vid is really good too!!!!!"
3,Justified: The Videos,"Here's what I think about ""Justified: The Videos"". I'm a huge fan of Justin Timberlake, but this DVD was kind of disappointing.The videos, of course, were great. However, the behind-the-scenes footage was boring, and the live performances were just okay, except the Brit Awards performance, which was cool. Justin Timberlake is a 4-star artist, but this is a 3-star DVD.If you're a big JT fan like me, buy this DVD. If not, don't buy it.Overall- 6/10"
1,Make it stop,"I cannot think of too many stinkers that even come close to this film of such unbearable awfulness it is an abomination that it exists. Smarmy, lame, and unfunny in turns and undeserving of the moniker mockumentary. It is actually a self-congratulatory piece of trash that grates on the viewer with its winking in-jokeness."
5,The movie is a funny take of the movie industry.,I loved this film. It makes a lot of fun of the movie industry. It is not about the story but more about subtle and funny gags to keep you watching. The cast is among the best I have seen in a long time. Rent it today.
3,I Thought it Was ok Not Great BY: ANTHONY BENEDETTO,SEEING AND LIKING JOE ESZTERHAS I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN CAUSE HE'S SO SLEAZY MOVIE WISE BUT I HAD FUN WITH BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN DUE MOSTLY TO ERIC IDLE'S LIVELY PERFORMANCE... BUT ITS FUN SOMETIMES JUST PLAIN STUPID. BUT NO WAY THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR... MAYBE AVENGERS IS
4,"Very amusing, if a little rushed. Amazing cast.","I found this film to be very, very funny, if only to see usually earnest actors such as Sly Stallone making fun of their perceived Hollywood egos. Eric Idle's presence seemed slightly incongruous (although that was probably the effect sought). His comic performance was bettered in style, surprisingly enough, by Chuck D and Coolio's double act, which reminded me of the upstaging performance of Morris Day and his sidekick in Purple Rain.If only for the (frankly astonishing) cast, this film is worth seeing. The Spinal Tap of film, only less of a story and more a series of clever and (mostly) subtle gags."
1,"I want the art from opening credits, but where can I get it?",Hated the movie. could not watch it but the art at the beginning is fantastic. I WANT IT! Any suggestions?
3,Interesting but.....,"Funny at some parts, very witty too. Alan Smithee (Eric Idle) has just made the biggest Hollywood Picture ever starring Jackie Chan, Whoopi Goldberg, and Sylvester Stallone. But when Smithee kind of goes crazy the film doesn't come out and it makes a lot of people mad. This is the story of that. Has a lot of potential, this movie that is, but doesn't quit live up to it. Very funny in some parts, then it lags and get's annoying in others. If you liked ""Waiting for Guffman"" and could stand and liked Julia Sweeny's ""God Said 'Ha'"". Then this is your movie, otherwise, let it go by."
3,curious,"The book seemed ok to me. What I do wonder about is where is the review from Newton Mass.? Apparently, this author took strong exception to that reviewer's comments. While I understand how hard it is not be be overly sensitive to negative remarks about one's writing, it seemed to me that the author over-reacted. She should have answere the reviewer based on the logic of her argument and should not have resorted to name calling. It appears that Amazon has not even printed the review so why is she so incensed."
3,"Sweet, but not wonderful","Allure is a nice book, but not as good as some of Jo-Ann Powers other novels. Try the American Beauty Series: Never Before, Never Again, and Never Say Never for truely excellent romance (especially one and three)."
3,A nice dvd player +4 head vhs recorder...But beware go video has had alot of quality control problems.,"This unit,has good picture quality,and sound...It is okey for your non videophile friends..As of 12/21/05,the unit can be modified,to play all regions...After i say this i am sure this will change...The mod imformation is on google ,and only involves settings,via your remote...Go video has not proven to be very reliable...Buy with caution....Please make sure you buy from a retailer that has a good refund/return/exchange policy...I purchased the unit as a gift..."
2,Cannot be used as a VCR,"Bought 2 from Fry's on April 17, 2006.Must return since cannot be used as a VCR because the clock jumps30 seconds in a random direction every time the unit is turned onor off. This includes when a program is timer recorded.It isn't one defective unit as both do the same thing.Calling customer support is a joke because one gets an automatedmenu with no access to a real person. None of the automatedmenu intems refer to the timer problem.Tried writing to the e-mail address, but received no answer after3 days.All the other features seem to work as advertized."
2,DVD 'BAD' after a few months,"My daughter bought one of these for college and at first it was OK. After about 6 months it started disliking DVDs and now it almost always comes up ""BAD"" on the front panel display. I've tried it dozens of times with different DVDs and only once did it come up to ""PLAY"", but I ejected and re-inserted and it was back to ""BAD"". I suspect the speed is the problem not the optics, but I could be wrong. I will attempt a return to Costco.Now that I see many similar complaints at different places on the Internet I would go with a trusted brand next time like Sony, Toshiba or Panasonic."
4,solid VHS-DVD player,"No frills unit and works fine. Go Video is a brand that was the first to push the VHS/DVD mix into their units. I have never had a problem with my unit and it was purchased in early 2005. It would be better if it was a little quieter while playing DVDs but that is minor. For the money, you can't go wrong."
2,DVD Quit Working,We've had this unit less than 18 months and the DVD no longer reads discs. The manual is useless and support from GoVideo is nonexistent.I will never buy another GoVideo product.
1,Draw your own conclusion...,"...Technical Data link for this product says:""Item Package Quantity: 1"" - nothing more, nothing less. Doesn't say much for this item does it?!Who's responsible for that anyway, Amazon or GoVideo? Based on that and the fact that every review for every DVD/VCR combo on Amazon is negative, I think I shall visit BestBuy/Circuit City in person to buy one. At least if there are any problems, I can get a real person to fix it."
3,eek,"Ton of action, lots of gore, and a few genuinely tense sequences. There's not a dull moment to be found, I kept jumping out of my seat. By the end I felt like I'd run a marathon. I am not a big fan of horror but this is pretty entertaining even for my scardy cat self.."
2,Director put some efforts in it,"The movie is okay. It starts right in action and you get whole hour of boredom until the moment where cards are revealed and you know what is actually going on in the movie. The special effects are not the worst and far to the best. However you can see, that the director actually tried to make the special outfit for the special forces and the graphics as told before are not bad. The monsters are boring looking however they look like monsters and it seems like he put some money in it. One of the actors had a very funny voice, hew was my favorite actor from the movie. Funny thing that when you think this movie has another hero, it actually does not and therefore a movie has some twists. I was thinking it is about aliens but no, closer to the end where truth gets revealed you realize it is far nothing to do with aliens or mutants. Well I watched the movie, and it got me bored to be honest, however you still can give it a chance."
1,loose bristles,"Hard to believe that brushes can be screwed up, but what can you say when almost on every use I have to pick bristles out of the glue. I wasted money on this one, maybe as I pick thru the bag I will find a few that were made properly."
5,Nice brushes!,These Horse-hair brushes are great - a must for avoiding ESD static build-up while cleaning electronic circuitry with alcohol. I trim about 1/3 to 1/2 of the length off some of them for a stiffer brush action.
5,Very informative,Great book - very informative -- detailed descriptions of each symbols/signs/saints -- will use to prepare a tour of my churchfor middle school catechism classes --
3,Lacking intensity,"Jose is pretty awesome, but on this CD is has no tracks that really blow up with smoking jams or cool lyrics. I had heard some of his songs on mixed CDs and was dissappointed with this CD."
2,Burned into my mind,I've read alot of books in the past 50 years. I've probably forgotten more books than most people have read. Not STICKMAN. It's an education in terror. A most unusual setting for a bookof this genre. I picked it up in '87 & couldn't put it down. A terrific read. If you don't like this book then I can't help you.
4,A well researched book,"This is possibly the most complete work on the actual Battle of the Little Big Horn. Mr. Kuhlman presents his evidence very convincingly. More like reading a text book, it is sometimes hard to stay focused, but is a must read for anyone with more than a basic knowledge of the battle."
1,Very Fragile!!!,"Unit is vsry fragile, Purchased 2 and both were broken in exactly the same spot.Wagner needs to step up and fix this problem!!Amazon was outstanding as usual in the replacement although a bit slow with the refund."
1,This gun is very expensive but also breaks easily.,This gun is very expensive but also breaks easily. The gun was broken after the first day of using it in the jobsite. I was so frustrated.
3,Works but needs extra work,"I just finished spraying a door with latex which is tough to spray even in the best of circumstances. Once I worked out the settings, the gun sprays nicely and evenly. The gun leaked at the packing seal out of the box and dropped blobs of paint on my door before I noticed the leak. The manual if you want to call it that is horrible. No advice on adjustments depending on material being spray, just a parts diagram and some crummy directions on how to hold the gun level. I'm used to spraying Acrylics and lacquers with my old Binks 62 so I know how to use a gun, I just need some advice on spraying with the HLVP process which is a bit different than the ""old"" days. The quality of the gun is good and it appears to be well made. It's a shame that Wagner did not put a bit more into the customer service side and include a decent manual."
2,Cheap and fragile,"This gun has a serious problem, the ""air tube"" is thin-wall aluminum and structurally supports the plastic handle. It gets stressed, fatigues, and snaps right where it enters the metal body. Even if you find the part, replacing it is very difficult, because Wagner glues it in!! Another problem is the clunky fluid control, you have very little control and cannot reduce or increase the fluid flow beyond a tight range. All in all, the gun functions adequately if everything is within specs.... perhaps it will even last long enough to finish a single project--that was not the case for me."
3,Something missing,"The voices were glorious, but I personally was not as moved as I was in other productions of La Boheme. Perhaps because it was made as a film, with too many closeups but not enough body language to convey their emotions. Voices and beautiful singers aside, I find faults with Anna's makeup, she is supposed to be a bohemian, but has perfect makeup all the time, and certainly doesn't look like she is sick. In the final scene, I don't understand why on her deathbed, she is in a sleeveless top while everyone around her has coats or heavy clothes on. Something just feel out of sync in this production."
2,DVD sound for blu-ray??,I was disappointed when I realized this music title has no lossless audio track. Dolby digital only for a music blu-ray?? It's a big joke. It's like SD sound with HD vision. The UK version has DTS-HDMA 5.1 then why not this one?? I liked the film version of the opera featuring Netrebko and Villazon but the weak sound made the appreciation experience tasteless. I'll never buy Kulture items until they figure out what HD sound is.
2,Does Not Make It,"I certainly agree withj the five star reviews that the singing is fantastic -- particularly in the second act. But the very obvious lip-sinking of their own voices destroyes the enjoyment for me; as does much of the camera work. The editorial states that the director of the film wanted to stay with Puccini -- but the ending of the first act is definitely not Puccini. For these reasons I did not like the first act, but remained to the end. The second act almost saved it and alone is worth watching. The rest is dreadful."
3,A Film Seldom Equals the Staged Opera.,"Puccini's tearjerker opera is much more enjoyable on stage, then on this film. I recommend to everyone, who haven't done it yet, to see a DVD of this opera [with or without Netrebko and Villazon], where the singers do not just simply ""mouth"" the arias, are not hampered by the extreme close-ups, and sing through the whole opera in one singular time period. A lot is lost in the filming process!Robert"
3,Film version not so hot.,"The voices are beautiful, the actors play their roles well, but I am not a fan of film vs. stage in Opera. I was disappointed. Film makers think they must add to the work with comlicated scenes, lots of ""extras"" and it's simply not necessary."
3,An 'in your face' 'Boheme',"I love this video as an audio recording. I generally get tired of Boheme because it is played so much and sometimes I force myself to listen to it too often because every time I turn around, another of my favorite singers has been recorded in it, so I feel I must experience it again. This time, I did not get tired of the music or the singing. It is wonderful to have as an audio recording, but so far, I have not gotten through the thing visually because the close-ups really put me off. Also the acting is so over-the-top - fine for on stage, but in a film, I find it macabre. I saw many good things, particularly in the settings and the timing of the direction, but the close-ups and constant movement of the camera annoyed me, until I had to turn the video part off and just listen whilst doing something else."
3,Director Butchers Act III,"Act III of Boheme is one of the most musically beautiful acts ever written in opera. It is book-ended by two-notes followed by and proceeded by lovely music depicting light snow fall. The Director chose to eliminate these two notes at the end of the act so he could quickly cut to Act IV, thereby, for me, making Act III incomplete. It is metaphorically as if the Director had torn an enveloping arm off the composer's work. I'm surprised that of the 52 reviews on Amazon to date, no one else has even bothered to mention this."
3,Rolando and Anna are perhaps the greatest opera tenor and soprano.,"I did not like the film version but the singing of these two opera stars was terrific. Puccini did not complete this work as he was working on his greatest masterpiece, Tosca. The libritist (Illica) changed the sequence between the second and the third act making Mimi a ""cheap woman"" by including an affair she had with with Muzzeta's lover (The Duque). The change was not based on what inspired Puccini to compose this work: ""Scenes of Bohemians"" by Henry Murger. Puccini agreed with the change made by Illica as again, he was bussy conposing Tosca. The theatrical element of this opera is flawed, but the music is just heavenly."
5,"Check your Blu-ray Region Code, Aussie","These are two of my favorite performers, and I love Puccini. The theatrical rendering of this opera is fine by me; the music falls a little more into the background in this kind of production because one tends to focus intently on the action, so that the lip syncing really wasn't a problem for me.I'm also happy with my Blu-ray disc. It certainly doesn't resemble the very negative description given by the reviewer in Australia. Probably he's not aware that US Blu-ray discs are different from those normally used in other parts of the world."
4,Kudos to innovation,"While I agree that some of the technical issues could have been better,lip-singing, subtitles, etc. the most important aspect of thisproduction is the continuous innovation and exploration of Opera productions.The only thing that matters at the end of the day is that the music, themessage, the humanistic aspect of tragedy and comedy gets into the audience,wherever the audience is, and this film achieves it.The music and singing are beautiful. I do believe that some better use of the surround sound capabilities could have been utilized, still it is a powerful production and cinematography. As expected, Netrebko and Villazon are great in their music and acting. This is not for those wanting a classical staged production, but for those who want to love the music and be moved by this super romantic couple.I can only hope more productions will innovate and explore technology to make great opera art."
2,Don't consider too much my opinion,"- I am not a fan of La Bohème...I saw it for the first time when I was 6. Now I am quite old.- The voices are average- You can see they are not singing...they are just moving their lips.- Acting is good- Mise en scene is low budget and conventional.- I bought it because it was recommended by friends.- I consider I wasted my money, I had already two other versions...Buy La Rondine or la Fanciulla instead. versions? Washington for La Rondine is great (the finale is different), La Fanciulla (Domingo).I prefer Roberto Alagna or Pavarotti versions.Best of lucks.Martin"
1,Lip Synching---Uggh!,I bought this film on blu-ray from Amazon but it was defective and I returned it for refund. My library had the dvd and I brought it home with great expectations.What a disaster! The video quality may be o.k. but it takes someone who is definitely not an opera lover to put up with a production where the singers are OBVIOUSLY lip-synching. (Pavarotti's Rigoletto with the incredible Victoria Vergera as Maddalena is an even worse example of a production rendered unwatchable because of the apparent idiotic presumption that the viwer would accept it because of the star power involved)Shame on everyone involved in this mess. Zero stars if allowed.Save your money.
5,"Glorioius performances, lovely sets","We were delighted. Beautifully photographed, perfect sets, compelling performances both in acting and singing -- this is a treasure to recreate for you the world of La Boheme and flush out the tear ducts. Compares with the stunning production of Tosca directed by Gianfranco de Bosio in astonishing effectiveness in adapting opera to film."
5,The best Boheme.,"If you don't need a cold shower after Act One, or a box of tissues after this film is over, you're not a living, breathing human.Netrebko is as beautiful as her voice, and Villazón is powerful, funny, loving, and heartbreaking in turn. Every other member of the cast plays his/her role to perfection, and the direction is sublime.I'll be watching and listening to this one many, many, many times."
4,Old Memories,Great book that brought back a lot of memories from my childhood. Sam Levenson has a way of putting things that everyone can relate too.
4,sam sam,his tales of growing up with a large family in new yorks tenements are great now you know what was so good about THE GOOD OLD Days.
4,A good book...,"I've read a couple of Patricia Thayer's and she is really good at bringing out her character's emotions. Chance is a man who is hung up on his father's past and Joy is beginning her new life with her baby. When her deceased husband's parents may file for custody of the baby, the obvious happens. She asks Chance to marry her in exchange for her land, which he always wanted. Theirs was a marriage of conveinece (which I love!!). They fell in love, not without hardship of course, and lived happily ever after. It was a really sweet story that has me reaching for it when my life isn't so rosy."
4,The fun final scene,"This game was great. But it was a little boring. But just a little. The place is not that big. It's a little spooky but not too much. It takes place in an old theater. It's pretty cool. Sometimes you're timed and you have to do something or find something before it's too late. That makes it fun. I'll give you a hint, one time the police are coming in to check the area before the demolition. You have to hide in the closet in the room you'll be in. It's a really fun game. The only reason I didn't give it a five star review was that it was just a little boring at first and the theater is small. This game is great."
4,Great gift for anyone with a pool,"I purchased this for my brother and his wife as they regularly entertain around their pool. A number of their friends have small children so plastic is essential at the ""kid"" table. The price is very reasonable."
2,"Great for Adults, not for kids","I teach a PE class at a school for kids ages 6-17. There are two different kinds of ""kickballs,"" utility and playground. This would be classified as a playground ball that is very hard and rough. This ball hurts really bad if a student gets tagged or pegged by it. The core is also so hard and tough that it is extremely tough for kids to kick it. I think this would be a good ball for an adult league."
4,More playable ball,"This 8 inch size can be kicked long distances and feels right for the average and newbie adult players. Very few non-serious players are able to kick the WAKA-size 10"" ball far, particularly when there's a wind or playing with newbies."
3,Something For Everyone,"THINK LIKE A MAN is based on the book by the same name from Steve Harvey, who frankly isn't one of my favorites. For that reason alone, I initially had no intentions of ever seeing this movie. But when I learned that the cast would include Kevin Hart and Taraji P. Henson among other people I enjoy seeing in movies, I decided to give it a shot. This movie is pretty entertaining and I think has appeal for men and for women and a broad age range. It's pretty predictable, but most romantic comedies are. I'd definitely recommend this title to friends or family looking for something to rent on the weekends."
4,Rent this one ;),"I love the different couples at different levels as well as the honesty of how dating and relationships can be in this fun and romantic comedy. Guaranteed some laughs in this movie, enjoy!!"
5,Lots of laughs!!!,Its was overall pretty entertaining and so so funny! Its a great flick and would highly recommend. If you need a good laugh watch this movie.
5,A MUST SEE,ex movie both entertaining and informative this is a must see movie for all women. it holds your attention from beginning to end.
4,Entertaining.......,"The movie itself is full of actors and actresses that I enjoy watching. I'm not going to tell about the film, however, I will say this is a great movie to watch...hands down. Everyone has been in one of these relationships in their life and it's entertaining to see it played on on screen. Very fun, hip and well acted in my opinion....you won't be disappointed......"
3,Not bad.,Premise is basically true.Funny and well done.Like the cast and appreciated the realistic depiction of different types of couples.
2,Not getting paid for my reviews.,Not getting paid for my reviews. I thought it was going to be funnier. Not getting paid for my reviews.
3,Don't get me wrong,"This movie is awsome!!! It is straight out funny, hilarious really. I think I laughed at least every 8-10 minutes of the movie. Kevin hart is hilarious and short hahaha. The reason why I didn't rate this a 5 star, is because the bad already had started showing it's bad, it looked like I knew but it would freeze for split seconds."
4,Entertaining....,"I needed a light hearted, not too much thinking (but not horrible) movie.... having a rough weekend. This did the trick. I enjoyed it"
2,Good Movie,I like the movie but an hour into the movie the movie stops working. I forward the movie several times and at the same spot it stops and wont continue.Will Amazon replace my movie or have I just wasted money on a bad movie????Very Disappointed!!!!
3,Think like a man,The funniest part of the film was the relationship between the guys. And what they had to say to each other. The rest of the film wasn't all that . .
3,Typical chick-flick,"This is a chick-flick on steroids. Instead of the typical story where you have a 1 man:1 woman story line - you're juggling 5 different relationships with 5 stereotypical guys. Of course, my question is why is it that the guys have to change? Why couldn't there be 1 woman that just wasn't worth it? lol...Anyway... it was a good way to waste a few hours... but basically pretty forgettable."
3,Relationships,"The movies is ok but does not fit into reality at times. Not everyone has high paying jobs or the latest in fashion or the cars and luxaries depicted in the movie.I would suggest more of everyday reality. It made me laugh a little but it was not funny, maybe others took it more seriously. Its ok something to pass the time on a day when you have nothing better to do. Who in reality follows a book? Anyway don't fall over yourself rushing to see it. I have seen much better movies on relationships.Think Like a ManInstant Movies"
3,Basic,"Typical movie plot, it has been done over and over. Man does wrong, woman resort to help, man changes for the good."
1,Think LIke A Man,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I didn't care for the book because I found the information too general, knowledge that most people with common sense would know. I really hope that women around the world find this to be the be-all book on relationships. Want a tip for having a healthy relationship? Here ya go, Love and respect yourself! You just saved your pockets!!"
1,BORING MOVIE,OKAY YOU WATCH THE PREVIEWS AND IT LOOKS FUNNY. THEN YOU WATCH IT AND WHAT A DUMB MOVIE. DON'T GET ME WRONG THEY GOT A VERY TALENTED CAST BUT THE STORY WAS BORING AND NOT FUNNY. I WATCHED TONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MOVIES AND I ENJOYED THE FILMS I SAW BUT THIS WAS SHIT. IT WAS LIKE WATCHING BET NOW. BET WENT TO HELL AND SO DID AFRICAN AMERICAN FILMS NOW. THERE ARE SOME GOOD FILMS OF THIS GENERA BUT I THINK THE CREW DOESN'T KNOW THE CRAFT OF A GOOD STORY. KEVIN HART YOU SUCKED IN THIS MOVIE.
5,WOW!!!!,"THE BOOK WAS GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE REALLY BOUGHT IT OUT BETTER. WE ALL NEED SOME HELP WITH RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR LIFETIME."
4,Much Better on DVD,"I thought this would be stodgy, but I actually found myself laughing and being pulled into the lives of the characters. I found them all to be relatable. It was sweet, and funny, and there was plenty of drama!! I enjoyed the ending too, written in typical chick flick fashion."
4,Good Good Movie,"This movie was very funny and stayed pretty true to Steve Harvey's book, Think Like a Man, Act Like a Lady. I laughed my way through this movie. I highly recommend it!"
4,I actually liked it,"Im a 28 year old male who enjoys ""romantic comedies"" here and there, but this one is actually funny and easy to watch. And Megan Good is extremely gorgeous and easy on the eyes."
5,Hilarious,Great movie and very funny. Kevin Hart is the show stealer but great cast and well executed. Very fun romcom!
3,Clear picture but average movie,"This movie was just ""OK"" to me. There was too much hype about it and I felt that Kevin Heart was funnier in other movies. Without him this movie would have been terrible, in my opinion. All I could think while watching and when it was over is, ""What was the big deal?"" I really wasn't moved by this flick at all. Just a lil something to watch on a very boring Sunday when your football team has a By Week."
4,Nice,"It's always nice to see a movie with black n white people together and to see how we are similar in almost all aspects (emotionally, physically and sometimes financially). Good laugh."
4,Very funny,"My husband and I cracked up watching this movie. We didn't go see it at the theater because we relied on critic reviews that it was not great. I loved it! Funny jokes. Not completely appropriate for younger audience due to some crude comedy and drug use, but, great for my husband and me. Thumbs up from us..."
3,Film was good,"I read the book first, and watched the movie some time later. I loved the book more. If I were to rate this movie, I would rate it as okay, as indicated above."
4,Think like a man,This is great movie. The are some truth about love. The reaction of men and the one for the women. You will laugh. You will enjoy it. No regret for me to watch this movie.
5,Over and over again,I could watch this movie over and over again Kevin Hart was brilliant and I love that blue eyes Ealy
3,Think Like an original man,"A bit silly and unrealistic. Decent acting and funny at times. Not exactly Oscar material, but very PG so the family should enjoy it."
4,Really Good comedy,Really good movie kind of predictable but the comedy more than makes up for it. Great movie for couples to check out.
4,Think like a man,I did not know this was a book on the market. I enjoyed the movie. Very good points only if women would follow it thing would be a lot difference. Less BABY momm's.
5,Great Product!!!!,Product was exactly how they described. Both disc works great and has no visuable damage. It came in its original packaging on wear and tear. Would recommend this seller to anyone looking to purchase quality products. Out of Time (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)Think Like a Man (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]
4,funny!,"great movie... way more comical than i thought it was going to be. went to see it in the theater, had to get it when it came out on dvd."
4,Better,This movie was better than I expected. It has lots of funny scenes. My husband was not excited to watch it but in the end he did enjoy it as well.
4,The bulletproof mans' plan.,"Steve Harvey sold every mans' bulletproof plan to get away witheverything has come to end...we must find Steve Harvey and catch,then make him rewrite this movie and the book that supports thismovie. Then I think some of our secrets will be safe."
4,Hilarious,Kevin hart was hilarious. The only person who did not play their role very convincingly was the girl who played Maya. Her acting sucked! Everyone else was amazing.
3,Originality and Creativity are Key,"It had the potential for great creativity and originality, but what you saw was the typical story plot... you knew how the movie was going to end."
3,Interesting,This movie was recommended to me. Has some good concepts but certainly would not use it as a life guideline
4,Good movie,I don't know why people complained about Steve Harvey being shown throughout the movie. It was About his book! Duh. Entertaining movie
4,Think Like a Man,"I purchased ""Think Like A Man"" as a gift.This movie was requested because the receiver had seen it before and thought the movie was funny and good."
4,Funny Movie!!,"This movie was stupid yet funny. It gave some good examples of opposite sex thinking. At the same time, some things were typical Hollywood exaggeration."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining,Some of the best dialogue I have heard in a movie in a very long time. Great acting with a great cast and plenty of cameo spots by other celebrities.
2,Could have been better,"This movie did not entertain me at all. If there is nothing else on t.v., then by all means, watch this if you're really, really bored. I'm a fan of Steve Harvey but not this movie. Kevin Hart was not that funny in the movie. Don't waste your money renting this movie, just wait until it is shown on tv. JMO"
4,Funny,It's funny great adult family movie. It's a predictable movie but still entertaining. I would recommend for rental not a classic
5,loved it,This is a very entertaining movie. Take a break and enjoy watching this movie. You will have a nice evening.
5,Funny,Clever and funny.I had a great time watching it with my wife. She even had tears on one of the last scenes!
3,Just ok,This is just ok. Typical funny dumb movie that is good to watch once but predictable. A bit dramatic for me
4,Think like a Man,I had read the book and was looking forward to the movie adaptation. It was entertaining and true to the book premise.
2,Not what I expected,It was just the digital copy. I thought it was the blu-ray I could play in my blu-ray player. Dissapointed.
3,Tyler Perry all over it.,movie was pretty good when it wanted to be. some parts are just plain boring. very similar to tyler perry movies. i would recommend a rent.
4,Feel good movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a play off of the Steve Harvey book. But it brought his humor, mostly through Kevin Hart, to life in film. If you are looking for a mindless, humorous, feel good movie this is a great pick."
5,One of my all time favorite movies!,Saw it 3 times in the theater and will watch it whenever I want a good laugh now that I own it!
4,Totally funny!,Loved the movie... It was hilarious! It's always funny when a movie replicates parts of ur life! Love movies like this! You should totally watch!
5,Loved it!!!!,"Great movie, would definitely watch again. Great for a date or girls night! Has just the right amount of comedy and romance."
4,pretty dang funny!,"Some funny points of view and interactions between men and women, classic, witty, funny, and CURRENT! great watch with some girlfriends!"
2,Think Like a Man video download,This was my first time using this download movie service. Once the movie finally was downloaded it was of great quality and a pretty funny movie. I was not expecting it to take 6 plus hours to download. I had previously been successful with live streaming HD quality movies when Blockbuster was still in business. Not sure why this system took so long. Not something I would do again if looking to watch a movie on the fly.
3,Good for parking lot striping,"Chalklines like this one are good for snapping long lines. The string is heavier and thicker than a carpenter's chalkline. However, this model doesn't have as thick a line as the older model Keeson GCL-130, but it is cheaper."
4,fungus halucinator headphone experience.....................,Oooopa.

4,Was this a rave?,"This CD is fun and maybe worth buying depending on how much of a McKenna fan you are. Honestly, though, you can get most of these sound bites on YouTube. Plus, it isn't all that long and takes place at a rave anyway: meaning, I like McKenna's more academic discussions, but this is fun to listen to when you want to zone out."
4,Fantastic novelization to a ho-hum movie.,"This book was an effortless read. The author develops the characters very well and makes them way more interesting than they were in the movie. She even goes the extra mile and develops characters responsible for starting off the chain reactions that lead to the deaths, which makes the events a little more tragic.The only complaints I can think of is that pretty much every woman in the book is surprisingly beautiful, no matter how old they are. That gets a little repetetive after a while. And just about EVERY man is a fat slob who wants only sex and beer.Other than those nitpicks, a great book."
4,Another winner by Ann Rule!,"Within a day of receipt, I had finished Ms. Rule's latest book, a compilation of true crime stories that kept me mesmerized from start to finish. Ms. Rule has a unique way of writing that makes the reader feel a part of the story. She portrays her victims as humans, next door neighbors and friends, and further, is able to get into the mind(s) of the criminals. Most true crime books consist of facts and jury testimony; Ms. Rule takes true crime a step further."
5,Can't believe Ann's writings could get an better than pasts.,"I payed much more than the amazon price. When I see an Ann Rule book on an overprice grocery store shelf, I know it will be worth it and it was. Thanks for another great book. Couldn't put it down. Unfortuanetly I read it so fast now I have to wait months or year(s) for the next. I was late to work everyday until I finished the book because I stayed up all hours and had little sleep. Ann's books hit close to home as I've lived in WA my whole life. A number have been in my own neighborhood where I built forts in the woods as a kid & where some stories have taken place. Thanks for another great (even though disturbing) book. Your writing is fantastic."
2,Not as interesting as her other books,"I have read most of Ann Rule's books, but somehow found this one less intriguing than her other books. I felt that the main story of the ship pilot could have been omitted. However, I will keep reading her books!"
5,No Regrets,"Ann Rule keeps you captivated with this true story! A true masterpiece. Ann tells the true story, in her unique way, keeping her readers spellbound."
3,Standard Anne Rule - Good Read,I enjoyed it. I quit reading her books for a few years because I felt the stories were getting stale. But they are always nice to go back to in a pinch for a good true crime story.
2,"Interesting stories, but poorly written","I usually try to enjoy Ann Rule`s books for what they are...decent retellings of infamous cases. Although her longer works are usually better than these collections (Green River Running Red stands out) I thought this book was rather poorly written. Her phrasing was often lazy as she used certain descriptive terms over and over again. Also, in the book`s second story, she reports several items wrongly, most notably the name of the song that supposedly enraged her while she recounted that particular tale. Overall, it was a disappointing writing effort from an author who should know better."
5,Another Great book by Ann Rule,This was another exceptional book by Ann. All the stories were interesting and well written. Some of them were very sad. There are some sick sick people in this world but I like reading true crime and Ann is the best in the field.Well worth it to buy the book. I pass it along to a bunch of people and they like it too.Can't wait til the next book comes out!
2,Rule Rocks!,"There is a real good reason why Ann Rule has had such a long and successful career - she's very good at what she does. All of her books are impossible to put down and her style of writing draws you in and sticks with you. ""No Regrets"" is truly a page-turner. At our house, a new Ann Rule book is a mandatory buy so maybe we're a bit prejudiced. But when I tell you that a new book from her is an occasion for us (my wife and myself) or that we buy hard cover AND paperbacks of each book AND we pass them around to spread the word, it's true. I highly recommend ""No Regrets"" to anyone from the reader with a casual interest in true crime to a professional forensic scientist. This paperback would make a terrific, inexpensive gift.The only bad part of being an Ann Rule fan is waiting for the next book."
5,She's done it again!,"Once again, Ann Rule writes a ""can't put it down"" true crime files. It's a page turner from the beginning of ""The Sea Captain"" to the end of ""... Or We'll Kill You."" The only regret you'll have about reading this book is finishing it and having to wait for her next book."
1,Not up to her usual standards,"These stories are not very compelling. I found it hard to be interested in the cases. I usually finish a book in this series in two days or so, but this one lingered for a week, and I skipped the endings of at least two of the chapters. Here's hoping for a return to her past mastery, next time out."
1,Not very good,"I'm sorry I purchased this book. I don't know any other way to put it than to say its just not very good. With so little time, and so many books, its not worth wasting time on. That's as clear as I can put it."
3,Good book. So so translation,"This is a great book in a translation from the 1930's that is pretty bad. It stumbles over idioms and slang so that some sentence make no sense at all. Still worth reading, but there has to be a better version."
2,"""Hallie Drawled""","I agree with the other reviews. And I stopped counting the ""Hallie drawled"" tags - awfully distracting after three."
4,Describing Difficulties in Government,"Bob Stone did a great job demonstrating the difficulties in government and how creativity and leadership can allow you to overcome those struggles to create great programs. The book was a great read and applicable in a time of a growing government. Just one thing - the Field Artillery is the King, not Queen of battle!"
2,"The kids like it, but I sure don't","This album is atrocious. Some of the singing on it will undoubtedly make the listener reach for the dial to shut it off. But my kids keep asking for these songs, so what really matters here? My perception of it? Or the kids? There are plenty of standards here that can be found on other albums, and performed much better I'm sure. But a few, like ""A is for Albatross"" is so unique I even find myself singing it every so often."
3,The Cemetery Club,It really is changed too much from the original play. Changing characters names is just too much of a change.
5,Cemetery Club,"I have always loved this movie with three great actress's. Any one who is older and can relate to losing a husband then trying to start over..will like this movie. It has funny moments and tearful ones, but overall is a great movie."
3,cemetery club video verses the play,The play I saw at Ladysmith's Little Theatre got in all the highlights without the swearing. Much more enjoyable for me.
4,THEIR ROCKINEST BEST,"This is my favorite of the Hoople. I think they were at their hardest rockin' best on here. ""All The Way From Memphis"" is still my alltime favorite song by the Dudes. Other highlights on here include ""Whizz Kid"", ""Honaloochie Boogie"", ""Drivin Sister"", with the sound of a car horn in the middle that will about blow your headphones off. And then a great rocker, the 9 minute ""I'm a Cadillac/EL Camino Dolo Roso"". I still fondly remember crusin' the streets with this album in my 8 track player being played at full volume, which is the only way to play any Hoople album. Enjoy this one, and annoy everyone around you."
2,Passionless,"Since I couldn't find any reviews if this recording I had to jump in. I am pretty dissatisfied with the cd. In the more dramatic parts of the piece, it just seemed like they were going through the paces. The little elaborations of the music in my opinion took more away from the performance than they added. I would reccomend buying a different copy of Carmina Burana if you can."
4,The Enlightenment versus narrow self-interest,"The author argues that Europe consists of a commitment to a set of ideas and values, not a political state. America used to strongly attract others, but it increasingly commands and dominates; while Europe attracts and persuades. Europe has reinvented itself in this way after the world wars of the twentieth century, while America has shifted toward market fundamentalism in economics and a triumphalist attitude in foreign policy.My main criticism is that the book is, admittedly, a polemical piece, written to encourage Europeans to persist in their social model. So it is a bit sugar-coated and uncritical.This is an important topic for Americans. Another good book on the new culture in Europe is ""Postwar"" by Tony Judt."
5,A guide which discusses the future and structure of democratic processes in a changing world economy,"American attitudes, methods and strategies have dominated the world for the 20th century - but it may prove obsolete in future endeavors: that's the message of Why Europe Will Run The 21st Century, a guide which discusses the future and structure of democratic processes in a changing world economy. The US still has power - but it may no longer be the driving force in determining the world. Chapters explain how the evolving European Union is offering a broader reach and approach which draws countries in rather than setting up opposing strategies. The Union's influence is increasing - and it is creating a new network alternative to American power that holds the potential of changing world influences in the future."
1,Crock of Crap,"Writing style was fine, and it was an interesting enough read but it was utter logical drivel... Europe's model is not one to brag about.As one who has lived long enough on both sides of the pond, many European economies, thought processes, and even way of life are interesting museums in and of themselves. Europe does not look like it will be able to keep up and I would even go so far as to say, some of these countries are practically reversing development, or regressing, behind much of the fast developing world."
2,why a 1991 version?,"not a bad disc, but the advertisement stated a 2004 disc, and i received one from 1991. if there is a newer remastering, i would have much rather gotten that, especially on an old recording like this."
1,affirmations,"This book may be good for those who have not at least already tried using positive affirmations in their life, but other than that, that is basically what most of this book stresses, other than categorizing you into a certain type of animal such as a hedgehog or a turtle, etc. Some case histories and positive affirmations, but much more would be needed for someone with true anxiety and depression."
5,"A ""pick-me-up"" reference book to cope with Life","I keep this book handy because I use it as a pick-me-up tool to cope with life's disappointments i.e. job stress; relationships gone sour. When I read it, the author writes so personal and ""up close"" that it seems he wrote the book ""for me"".When I finish a chapter, I feel added strength like this book is a tool to help me cope with life's ups and downs."
1,Compared with Relax- By Dr Patrick McCarthy,"This book has no comparison with Relax: Say Goodbye to Anxiety and Panic by Dr Patrick McCarthy. The McCarthy Way is a cure for anxiety using self-hypnosis. Its easy to read and the CD simple to follow whereas this book, although useful is too verbose, too strung out and does not deliver the expected results"
3,Self-Coaching: How to Heal Anxiety and Depression,There is nothing new under the sun......meaning I've heard it [and read it] all before. one of these days something will click form me and I'll beat this thing
1,Broken Record.,"this book is pretty much all filler. the ""Dr"" that wrote it seems to like to repeat things over and over. the techniques are garbage... period. the book is basically about talking to yourself repeatedly till you forget your problems. what is that? the book should be called ""Sweep your problems under a rug"". got news for ya folks... life sucks sometimes and the last thing ya wanna do is dismiss problems. you gotta face them head on and just deal with the pain... it WILL pass, and if you cant and you become suicidal... books are not going to help, real doctors will."
5,Time in!,"This book is the most motivational tool for motivation in my playbook. Just yesterday, in fact, I screamed at myself that I'm a ""f**kin' p*ssy,"" then dropped and gave myself 50."
1,"Your kidding, right?","Who is this guy kidding? The ""advice"" contained in this meaningless tome is about as useful as an anchor to a drowning man. His touchy-feely approach to mental illness shows he has not experienced the living hell himself. He should stick to giving advice to pre-schoolers and leave the psychological work to those better qualified, if not better experienced, in these matters."
4,Helpful but a little harsh,"There are some insightful points made in this book. Firstly it is hard to deny that thoughts precede emotions. Secondly, a lot of thinking patterns which might be considered 'good' in today's society, such as constant planning and controlling are pointed out as flaws and sources of possible meltdown. I thought, however, that he trivialised aspects of anxiety and depression. Perhaps anxiety and depression are the result of a 'child reflex' type of thinking but I'm not so sure that we have total control over anxiety and depression just through simply re-framing thoughts. For example, why do you get more depressed at certain times of the day etc? There is likely more going on than just poor cognitive judgement and I also think it's highly likely we inherit some of these traits. Overall, however, it appears to be a good stab at a 'fix yourself' book, hopefully the suggestions, if followed through correctly, will bring some respite."
5,Nothing better!!!,"If you even think you may be suffering from anxiety, stress, depression or anxiety attacks, Don't wait one second longer. Get this book. It will literally change your life. I have been reading and studying personal improvement from Anthony Robbins, Brian Tracy plus a whole lot more for years. In one weeks time, this book changed my life. It makes more sense than you could even begin to comprehend. It was the best $10.00 I ever spent. I finished it up on Sunday, and I am reading it again just to enjoy the fantastic joyous feeling I have for life now. This is a MUST HAVE book. Read the reviews if you don't believe me. There is a reason why most everyone rated it with 5 stars. I would have given it 10 stars if I could have. If you want change, buy this book. If you want personal happiness, buy this book."
5,Dr. Joseph Luciani does it again with Self-Coaching!,"With an amazing combination of style and psychological insight, Dr. Luciani has written what will soon be seen as the next breakthrough in bibliotherapy and self-help. Using over 25 years of clinical experience, Dr. Luciani explains how to overcome depression and anxiety by confronting the irrational insecurity at the foundation of these disorders. He uses numerous case descriptions to illustrate the self-coaching technique, which makes the book easy to follow and the techniques easy to apply. In addition to looking at depression and anxiety, several maladaptive personality styles are examined in a self-coaching framework to treat a wide range of psychopathlogical behavior. There is no doubt that all readers can benefit from the revolutionary and powerful therapeutic tools that make up Self-Coaching."
5,I've Become My Own Coach!,"Self-Coaching is a wonderful book with clear, succinct guidance for anyone who, like myself, is affected by anxiety and depression. Dr. Luciani incorporates his own experiences that allow you to relate to how his methods are used and how they actually work. Self-Coaching has been exactly the motivation that I have been searching for! Finally, a book that I could not only comprehend, (no dictionary needed!) but have been able to implement to take charge of my own life, something that I have struggled with for years. If you are ready to change the way you ""deal"" with life, this is the book that will make the difference."
3,Self Coaching,To be honest this wasn't a book that I could get into. I returned it after scanning it.
5,"Balanced, self reliant approach to mental healing","Dr. Luciani places the responsibility for curing mental health with its sufferers. What could be more affirming to those people than knowing that they have power over their illness? The book is outside the trend to diminishing self reliance, and it offers a calm and encouraging alternative to the culture of medication."
2,confusing throughout,too many categories by which you could be labled...even after reading the text one isn't sure where you would fit
5,Great read so far; know there is better to come,"I just began to read this book and already the first pages have directly drawn my attention to the ""chrnoic apathy I have for my own self."" In browsing through the pages, I can already tell that this is going to be the foundation that will take me out of self pity and into self acceptance. I have lived by the ""what if"" - ""I should have"" - ""I could have"". I realize that these words should not be in my vocabulary.Thanks Dr. Jo! Tue Happiness is a CHOICE!"
4,nice little gift,"I bought these as a gift for a friend and they are pretty nice and just as described - they are perforated for separation which leaves a rough edge on the one side, but for 12 and a half cents each there's not really much to complain about!"
5,Eyes Wide Open,"WOW! What a great book. Extremely informative. I do not have to be a karate expert to save my life. Ms. Kilgore does a great job at providing techniques that anyone can use. I was very impressed with the real life stories that people were willing to share with the readers on things that happen everyday, that I take for granted ""this won't happen to me"" well,they do. I also was amazed at the things people actually do to your personal identity, on vacation, at home, at school etc...... Thank you for all of the great information that you have provided me!"
1,not what was pictured,The item quality is good but it is not the same bag as advertised. My review; it is deceptive advertising and a major pain trying to return an item to amazon they fall very short in the user friendly website department.
4,Great read but some historical flaws,"As a student of medieval history, I found the book to be valuable in acquainting me with histories of women warriors in early European history. However, I can't forgive Ms. Salmonson for her gross error in the death of Aethelflaed, warrior daughter of Alfred the Great. While Aethelflaed did help her brother drive the Vikings out of England, she most certainly didn't die in combat as alleged by the author. Please read the excellent biograghy, ""The Lady Who Fought the Vikings,"" by Don Stansbury. She did lead her forces but was more known as a peace and treaty maker, and she never fought in combat.I feel that Ms. Salmonson may have taken literary license with other historical figures so please investigate further any women warriors that interest you. I have my own copy of this book but believe it may have other flaws. Nevertheless, it still is an excellent compendium of women warriors and makes great reading for historians and lovers of fantasy fiction."
4,A Good Starting Place,"As the title suggests, this is an alphabetical listing of over 1,000 warrior women. More than half of them are from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Persia, but there's a good variety of others. If you're looking for a general overview or some light reading, this is a pretty good book that gives correct and concise summaries. Don't expect any in-depth description or analysis; this isn't that kind of book.My one gripe is that Salmonson doesn't cite her sources very well. There's a bibliography, yes, but it doesn't say which entry corresponds to which source, which is a pain when doing research. And of the dozens of ancient texts the author must have consulted, only two or three are cited."
5,La Magia De Sandro,This guy and his music are the best. Sad songs...lots of ballads...are included on this CD. He is considered the Elvis Presley of his country...and once you hear his music....you will understand why. The best...and magic indeed!
2,not crazy about this...,which is funny because I have another one in plain white which I love. Somehow this one doesn't fit the crib properly; it is too short.
3,missional case studies,a collection of case studies to back up the missional framework outlined by the Gospel and Culture Network
2,HTML: Your Visual Blueprint,"This book has good information, but is poorly organized. The ""lessons"" are not organized in a logical way.Plus, the text itself has grammatical errors and the illustrations show Web sites with laughably bad errors. For instance, ""We takes the risk out of buying . . ."" And ""Directors Marketinging Book."""
2,Not Impressed,"I am VERY disappointed with this book. It was the required reading for a barnesandnoble.com online class, so I mistakenly figured it would be a good book.I can handle all the typos and grammatical errors, for example;""...how to add dynamic content o your Web page...""""To perform tasks in t his book,...""""Changing the color and font enables you to emphasize important information or to make your Web pages more aesthetically pleasing or more readability.""However, in many instances, the code in the examples has errors too! I don't know how anyone who is trying to learn HTML, CSS, or XHTML without prior knowledge could learn from this book.That being said, I do like the layout of the book and the numerous examples and pictures. If the editing department had done their job, this might actually be a good book."
5,Excellent step-by-step learning format,"I purchased this book despite the less-than-satisfactory reviews here. I am glad I did. I used the textbook to supplement my online learning experience for university and ended up relying on the book heavily to complete projects and to get insight the class text didn't offer. I was able to create my own web page using only HTML -- that is, strictly text script and nothing more, I defined backgrounds, chose fonts, selected font colors and sizes, imbeded pictures, and links to other pages. I am amazed with what I learned from this book. Without it, I would have struggled with the rest of the students in the class who had no prior experience in creating web pages. I got an A- for the class and my project because I was able to clarify so much of our class discussion and projects with the contents covered in this book. I consider it an absolute must have for learning the foundation skills of web page design."
5,Great Book!,I learned alot from this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in web design and development.
3,reissue land.................,The first CD is quite a treat. The other two are 70's reissue. Only interesting to those that haven't heard these two old guys try to relive the glory years.
4,A good book with an ubeatable price!,"A good book and in good condition, easy to understand and with the esential terms not only about biogeography , but also ecology and general processes that affect byosphere."
5,This is just a great case and camera,"duh-Follow the instructions dude. I have been to over 35 dives with this case and no leaks. Just make sure you grease the O-ring ,and there is no dirt ,dust or hair on it and test it like the manual says and you are OK. Great camera that you don't feel you have with as it's light."
3,Zero...to Zero,"I watched this movie last year I believe...and It is one of those movies you just dont remember very well.Zero has had great productions since then..Was a big fan of ""new bloods""..But This really didnt stack up in anyway.The quality was a bit shady and the energy could've been better.However, an AWESOME instructional skateboarding video is this new one called Skateboarding Explained.It is a KILLER step by step video and lacks nothing to be requested. Its totally helpful and leaves you with a want to create your own new tricks!You can actually find it on Amazon :)Keep Skating!Peace"
5,Awesome Video,This video is awesome stuff. I got it because of the help it gave a friend of mine. I have to say that this DVD is by far the best out there. If you want to learn the basics for boarding then this is the DVD to get.
3,"heard better, and non-orginal",i got into this band a few years back..before From Under The Cork Tree and before all these scene kids started to like them.....anyway..this CD isnt as bad as some other bands...its better than others but worse than some...Patrick does have a good voice...and Pete can write some good lyrics.....overall....not bad....listen to it before you get it
3,Just like a DRIVE THRU band...,"Not a bad album to listen to, but it has all been done before... Very reminicent of Starting line, allister, and taking back sunday to name a few. These guys need to sit down and write some original stuff, Grow some balls, crank up the amps and rock out. Bands like fall out boy need to limit the amount of soft emo punk that gets crammed down our throats. Rock against Emo."
2,"Decent, but derivitive","This starts out as a farily decent, if increadalby average Punk/Pop album. The problem is, is that the best parts of all of their songs are stolen from other groups. Not taken and improved on, but stolen outright. Like on Patron Saint...the last track, the chorus is taken directly from Taking Back Sunday's song Timberwolves at New Jersey. They changed a few words and called it a new song...lame. The first track does the same thing, but I cant remember the song.They would have been better than other groups in the genre (i.e. Blink, Good Charlet, Simple Plan, etc.) if they had stayed away from stealing others work. Oh well.P.S. If you get a chance to see them live, do it, they are amazing."
5,FALL OUT BOY ROCKS!!!!!,"this is an amazing cd, every single song is incredible. one of the gtreatest cd's ever!!!"
3,I can't help but rate a clone band low,"Let me start by saying that the lead singer has a great voice which carries this band. I give this band 3 stars because of their unoriginal style and cliched lyrics. I think they just listened to some fruntrunners in the scene and wrote down some of their lyrics. Take their latest album as an example: Its title is 'My heart will always be b-side to my tongue', very reminiscent to a lyric in a 'Brand New' song('I believe you but my tommy gun don't). Also, as pointed out before, the chorus on 'patron saints of liars and fakes' sounds dangerously familiar. I know: It follows the same melodic hook as a Taking Back Sunday chorus(Cute Without the 'E'(Cut from the Team)There are however some highlights to this album: Songs like 'Chicago.....' and 'Tell that...' are two outstanding tracks, I just can't get over how incredibly unoriginal this cd.Just like someone said(I can't remember who) 'The better the singer, the harder he is to believe'"
4,midwest represent,"Definately a good cd. midwest represent for the chicago boys. their song titles are definately unque. it works though. i'd have to say my favorite songs are calm before the storm and grenade jumper. calm before the storm because of the guitar work and singing on it. the ""what you do on your own time"" is the best part of the song. grenade jumper is good because of that little 2 second drum opener. right after the guitar ends, it has the best drum opening. ( i am a drummer myself, thats why i pay attention to this stuff.) overall its a good cd. pretty good singing usually and the guiatr work is great."
5,"To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar","My buddy burned this cd for me. From the minute I listened to the first song I was hooked. After listening to the music and how tight they play together. I started listening to the lyrics that just stuck with me. I havent taken the cd out of my player for 6 months. They are coming in concert in about a week and I'm stoked. Someone was ragging on them that Patrick has a whiny voice that 12 year old scream about. I dont know if he was listening to the same band I was. Why would someone even waste their 10 minutes complaining on here if they didnt like something. They obviously suck because they have a huge fan base and are all over the place, yeah thats cause because they suck. I have respect for any band, I'm not sure if those people know the dedication and time it takes to make music. FOB is the best bet for your $$."
5,Why don't you own this CD already?,"This CD and Fall Out Boy's other, earlier CDs really set them apart from other ""Pop-Punk"" bands that they are compared to. Thus is a CD you can listen to from beggining to end. Fall Out boy is a really great band, and they are just as good live as they are on the CD."
1,fall out boy has come out of nowhere....,"to suck the life out of teen age losers who love mtv. mtv doesnt hav a single aspect of what music reallly is, its all bout the money and nothing else and this band will be a one hit wonder in a few months.."
1,"the CD sucks, how did they get to make a 2nd one?","Please stop watching MTV and please stop supporting bands like Fall Out Boy. Every song of their's sounds like every song that blink-182/Simple Plan/Good Charlotte/The Used have come out with. There is absolutely nothing original or talented about this band.Oh, and I hate the singer. I could find lots of people on the street that can deliver better vocals than this ******. His voice gets intolerable within a minute and I feel like smashing the radio (which sucks, too) whenever I hear his little ****** voice.I recommend that you go use your money to buy any music from these bands: Led Zeppelin, the Doors, the Clash, Queen, the Pixies, the Strokes, Blondie, Dead Kennedys, the Cure, Aerosmith, old Metallica, old Misfits, Black Flag, Bad Religion, Black Sabbath, Slayer, White Zombie, Queens of the Stone Age, Fugazi, the Sex Pistols, and pretty much anyone else that has been mentioned by the one-star reviewers that don't watch MTV or listen to the radio."
2,It's ok i guess,Well I have recently heard fall out boys take this to your grave. Well there are some good hooks in this album but not enough to make it good or memrobale which is the main problem. You forget the whole album after you hear it! Well this is thier best cd so if you are a fall out boy fan pick this up because you will love it! Be warned stay away from the second album it's all a bunch of MTV promoted music and is made only to become popular!
1,"These ""boys"" aren't for real","I can see why certain people could like this kind of music. However, I hate to tell you this but the members in this band are all fake. All they probably do is listen to their managers and write and play their songs according to how they tell them to write them. A real rocker says to heck with the manager and writes their music how they want, regardless of how much fame and popularity they get for writing it. And how can you call them original, all they sound like is the typical green day wanna-be? This band sucks, and for them to be considered rock is a disgrace."
2,Very uninspired and boring.,"I decided that it was time to get a Fall Out Boy CD and I picked this up two or so days ago seeing that I liked all of their singles from their other CD, From Under the Cork Tree. Boy, was I crazy to do so. All of the songs, save for Grand Theft Autumn (Where Is Your Boy) and Homesick at Spacecamp which are very average at best, are terrible and they sound the same.I must say that I'm TERRIBLY dissapointed with this release and don't see how FUtCT could be any worse. I'm scared to buy another Fall Out Boy CD now..."
5,this is better than the new stuff,"ive loved fall out boy since the beginning and this album is simply better than under the cork tree yes its true that both albums have soaring guitars, clever names, and catchy melodies this album is simpler and cleaner and more organised than the new stuff although i am proud of fall out boy for having a hit album and hit song(sugar were goin down)which i could listen to all day now the whole world can see fall out boy in all their glory and they can see that sick thing they do with their giutars when they spin around i love that I LOVE FALL OUT BOY"
5,this cd is fukin amazing,"at first i thought this would be another one hit wonder with dead on arrival being there big hit, but i was completely off. this is one of the best bands i've heard ever. every song on it is great, i dont even listen to dead on arrival anymore as the other songs deserve just as much recognition. this cd rocks, its a must for anyone that likes punk, pop or whatever. from grand theft autumn to saturday to calm before the storm, everysong on this cd is unreal. fob must put so much time into their lyrics aswell cause there not singing about jerking eachother off, there singing about the tough times, leaving there home and what not. once again this is a must have, listen to me man, i've seen them in concert, i've been following them since they first formed over a year ago and they've already been signed and produced a full length cd, this bands gonna be huge."
5,one of my favorite CDs.,"well, I pretty much found out about Fall Out Boy due to the release of ""Sugar, We're Going Down."" I usually always work backwards and buy old CDs before new ones by bands that are new to me. so I bought this before I knew most of ""From Under the Cork Tree.""at first, I skipped quite a few songs, I don't know why.but then I started to listen to all of them and I realized that there wasn't a song on there that I couldn't stand.yes, I think lots of songs on the album sound alike. but it really doesn't bug me because they all sound good.I don't know. I think the whole album genius, musically, lyrically and vocally.my favorite off this CD would have to be ""the patron saint of liars and fakes.""other standout tracks: ""tell that mick he just made my list of things to do today"", ""saturday"", ""the pros and cons of breathing"" & ""chicago is so two years ago.""definitely worth the money."
2,Eeeeee,"i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny. heh, so witty. anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday. those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars."
3,Fall Out Boy-Take This To Your Grave,"It is pretty rare that I get excited about a generic pop-punk CD these days. Bands like MxPx and Green Day are what got me started into this kind of music but now there are just so many bands that can play this stuff well that it becomes less and less appealing to me. Fall Out Boy, however, is a bit of an exception. This group of musicians is truly talented and it even shows on a few of the songs here. You are not going to find anything groundbreaking if you decide to pick up ""Take This To Your Grave."" But if you are just aquiring your taste for this music, you might as well go get this because it's not going to get much better for a pop-punk album. The songs are executed well with a dominately ""dark-humor"" lyrical approach. This is no award winner but I would be willing to bet these guys put on a heck of a live show.68/100"
5,FOB is pretty awesome,"After hearing some raving reviews about FOB, I had to check them out. This album is completely awesome. Pop/punk is my guilty pleasure and this cd might make my top 10 list of the category. Key tracks to check out are: Sending Postcards.. & Dead on Arrival but the whole cd is awesome."
5,Awesome band,Fall out boy is truly amazing there songs are sooo good there are none that i dislike. if your into pop punk check these guys out and go to there shows and support them! cuz its all about the fans
4,Don't hate the fact you like this album..,"This album is a good album, despite what all you doubters out there think. The melodies are good, the riffs are fast and catchy, the lyrics thoughtful and while it's not been spectacularly produced, it is still a good album. While we know everyone out there isn't going to like this, I can't understand all the anti-FOB material in the reviews. If you genuinely dislike this band, then don't listen, sell the CD, and most of all, don't write a damn review about them. If you hate the fact that you like this album, don't, for the reasons I have listed. If, on the other hand, you dislike it because you don't want to be seen liking pop-punk (which this album is not, anyhow) or emo, then grow up. More of the same, please, Fall Out Boy."
5,Pop punk at it's best,"The band says this Cd was ment to be non-stop excelent tracks. Mission accomplished! to this day this is one of the best almums in my collection. for those of you who liked this, cheack out a CT local band at prop24.tk"
1,Sappy Mindless Garbage,"This CD seems to have been written with angsty 16 year old guys in mind. The lyrics are lame at best, and though they might cheer up the heartbroken teen who thinks he'll never love again, they'll annoy anyone else. All of the musicians, but especially the singer and drummer, should be in groups of much higher caliber than this. A few catchy lines and a record label willing to pay for a good recording studio put these guys where they are now, but there's nothing more to it. Don't be fooled."
2,Apparently ignorance is bliss,"I got this cd when it came out. I regret stil having it, but nobody wants it. Not to my suprise. I can't stand this music. Too repetitive and all the songs sound alike.As for other people who reviewed this cd. IT IS NOT THEIR FIRST CD. I know that and I don't even like them. Ever heard of something called research? It works wonders."
1,Man you guys are idiots,"i've haerd a lot of crappy pop punk bands, but this one takes the cake for MOST CRAPPY BAND EVER! anytime i've said that something was cliche or unoriginal, i take it back, because this band is more cliche and unoriginal than any slipknot or finch or puddle of mud i could have trashed. this album should be used as an alternative fuel source for automobiles in the future, that way they'd do something good to the world"
2,I Swear I've Heard This Before,"I swear I've heard this cd before. Oh wait, I have......everytime I believe these reviews written by ""pop/punk/emo"" fans. If you want to sound exactly like another band, at least choose someone with a hint of originality, because then at least you're the second band to have that sound instead of the 487th. Are the lyrics and instrumentation good? I don't know because I couldn't get past that whiny voice that 12 year old girls find oh so emo. Gag. I'm vaguely reminded of Rufio, only they scored major points for including soundbytes from Hook."
5,i was there,"unfortunately, i was on the clock & my job was threatened if i went to the parking lot to film with the rest. but we won, thanks in large part to the publicity we had from moore. the union is dead now (all the political people left for jobs in places that didn't exploit their workers yet present a 'liberal' front like borders does). sad but true. it's worth viewing, however, if you need re-engerization to fight the power, baby. or to realize that your life is pretty good, no matter what your economic situation. you ARE sitting in front of a computer right now, aren't you? how much of the world population is more concerned with eating than buying books & movies?"
4,Candid & Accurate,"This is unreal. Of all the CEO types with which Michael Moore spoke to, not one of them answered his question - If companies are making record profits (some in the billions) then why are there so many layoffs?The man from NIKE said that he wouldn't open a shoe factory in the US because he doesn't think Americans would want to make shoes.You've got to see this to believe. Michael Moore is a genius."
2,Moore's worst movie to date,"I am at heart soemwhat of a michael moore fan. I love bowling for columbine and roger and me was revolutionary for its time period. However the same thing can't be said about the big one. It basically in short summary is a cheap way for moore to promote his book tour for his first novel, Downsiize this. The film lacks depth and purpose and while it does make some good points about Welfare and welfare reform it basically says the same things that were stated in roger and me except in a less convincing way. The moore fan many like this. The casual movie watcher should stay away. It'll put you to sleep."
5,Only a Corporate Crook Could Hate This!,"Michael Moore is truly a genius! In every scene in this movie, he puts the pressure on corporate America, showing the world how sickeningly greedy the corporations really are. My favorite scene is where he gives a company a check for 80 cents to ""pay the first Mexican worker's wages"". When the woman accepting the check says nervously, ""I wish you would have called ahead of time to give us some preparation,"" Moore just smiles at her and says, ""I wish you would have give the workers who have lost their job notice so that they could have prepared for it."" Everyone should see this film!"
4,Another great Moore movie,Moore shows us that outsourcing was big when Clinton was president. He makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees. Big One will open your eyes.
1,Michael Moore is an idiot,"This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars."
3,The Nike Demon,"What really stands out in this uneven but entertaining look at Corporate America is the Nike CEO's pathetic attempt to justify his factories in Indonesia, complete with underage workers and death squads lurking outside the doors. There is a lot of evil here in our own country, and more power to Michael Moore for trying to do something about it. And if the movie lacks the focus of his 1989 masterpiece ""Roger & Me"", you can't blame the guy for trying. At least he seems to care."
5,"Micheal Moore is the funnier than ever, and still dangerous","He has done it again. The movie makes you laugh out loud, more than all friends episodes combined. I know that doesn't sound like that much, but it is pure hilarity and he's more dangerous than ever. Inviteing Nike's CEO to visit a nike plant in indoniesia made me wet myself."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Roger and Me was a great movie, no question about it, a real American classic. But Michael Moore became so well known that people could see him coming in The Big One, which lacks the edge of Moore's first outing. And the scene with Knight was disappointing, Moore fell down from my eyes by letting a CEO get the best of him. Anyway, it's still a fun movie but don't expect it to be another Roger and Me."
3,AN EYE OPENER! GREAT STUFF!,MICHAEL MOORE REALLY EXPOSES CORPORATE AMERICA'S ACTIONS AND SHOWS THE EFFECTS! LOVE THE WAY THE DOCUMENATRY WAS DONE AND WHAT IT CAPTURED!
2,Moore is not much to watch as it ages,Moore movies are ok to see one time. After that...it's at a garade sale and you end up giving it to Goodwill.
4,A good Terri Blackstock read,Terri Blackstock has a way of keeping my interest throughout her series. She has a way of making the people very real yet show all of us our need for God and His direction
1,false advertisment,i orderd wood and metal blades and recived wood and plastic blades this is simply wrong
3,Not what I expected,"I received the book quickly and it was really nicely packaged. When I opened it I expected it to be used, but nearly all of the pages were written on or highlighted. Although I have bought books that were in ""good condition"" before and none of them had this many markings in them."
2,lap desk,"the product is very nice, but the shipping cost was extremely out of line. The item came out double the cost!!!"
4,lapdesk works great,"of all the lapdesks we've tried, the posture rite lap desk fits perfectly at just about any angle (as long as your sitting) because it forms to your lap."
2,lap desk,I had read reviews from others on this product. I wanted it to usewith my laptop. The biggest problem is that because the top is somevery thin plastic the heat from my laptop comes right through.Therefore it doesn't serve my purpose so I am not too pleased with it.
4,Posture-Rite Lap Desk,"I bought this as a lap desk for using a notebook computer. Its cushion is thick and comfortable. I agree with a previous review that its surface is slippery, proabably designed for a purpose other than as a platform for a computer. Nonetheless, it suffices."
2,"Fine for papers, NOT for computer","Have had this a little over a year. It was fine at first, but after a couple months, the top began to warp from either the weight or heat from a laptop computer, for which it was purchased. It's now so warped, that I had to add large rubber feet to the laptop computer, as the warped desk top plastic was blocking the air vents for the computer.Recommended only for papers, but definitely NOT for a computer due to the thin plastic top which will not hold its shape."
1,black pearloid tremolo cover..,holes do not line up for american fender stratocaster. not even close. looks nice. but if it dont work it dont work. like my ex wife.
5,Just great to play.,This game proves to give me hours of play. Enjoyable moves and time well spent in playing.A game I am really glad that I have.It was a gift and I thank my girlfriend for it.
1,THE PLUMBERS BUTT,THIS GAME ROTS IS SHORT EASY AMD STUPID DID I SAY ITS SHORT BECASE IT IS GOD I HATE THIS STUPID GAME BEAT IT IN 45 MINTES WHATS WRONT WITH NINTENDO NO MARIO FRO LONG TIME NOW MARIO AND ITS BAD BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"A review of ""New Super Mario Bros."" in 2012","A review of ""New Super Mario Bros."" in 2012, by necessary, cannot be the same as a review of the same game in 2006. Too much has changed, and the Mario series has entered into some strange times.First off, part of the impact of ""New Super Mario Bros."" is it was the first 2D Mario game in fourteen years, which was so much of the appeal of this game. Fourteen years is a long time, and so much had changed in the game industry, with the FPS and 3D revolution, MMOPGs, and the rise of causal gaming. Yet despite the radically altered [timescape] landscape, ""New Super Mario Bros."" became a rousing success.In retrospect, while [fine] fun, the game never raises above truly inspired."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS is a super fun game. I am a huge fan of classic video games. And this is definently just like the origional Super Mario Bros. It is so much fun and a game everyone should have. One of the best Nintendo DS games I own. I wish Luigi's Character apeared a bit more but that is the only, and very slight problem. This game gets 5 stars from me!"
4,Classic,It's nice to have a classic game available on a newer system. Coming to Amazon was the better idea because it goes for sooo much more in store. Great buy!!
5,very entertaining!,"I bought this game for two 8 year old granddaughters. They adore it! I highly recommend this for the little ones. It's an old favorite, and fun for hours! Not too easy, not too hard, just perfect!"
5,Mario,Product was as described.Package got here very lightening fast. I am very happy with this seller. My daughter was very thrilled and happy. :)Thank You and kudosAngel
5,A Blast From The Past!,"I Loved playing this game back in the 80s and I love playing it now. I love the classic games and Nintendo bringing back Super Mario Brothers for this generation with the updated technology is awesome. My kids also like playing this game on the DS and has kept them occupied for ours. There's just something about a game that you don't have to read a manual before playing. It just comes natural and your able to figure it out as you go, but still challenging enough to keep you interested."
5,gift,It was purchased as a gift for my grandson. I was told he played it in the car all the way home.
5,Juego,"Juego se adquirio y se ha utilizado por mas de un mes y todo bien, todo excelente, todo de maravilla"
5,New Super Mario Bros. DS,"I love this game; it's fun, exciting, stressful... it's like being in a relationship except you can shut it off or put the game on mute."
5,Can't put it down!,This game is a lot of fun! Old style Mario with a bit of twist in some parts. I can't put it down! You'll enjoy it very much.I just wish they would come out with Super Mario Land!
5,This was a gift,This was a Christmas gift for our church so I have no idea if the person who received it liked it or not but I hope so.
3,It's fun when it works right,"We bought this because our boys lost the new one we bought, so they got this duplicate, then a week after this came they found the original, so I gave this one to my husband, he said it's good when it's not freezing up, which he said it does alot. I guess that's what you can expect when you buy something used. The seller did ship it really fast though."
3,"Good game, average for Mario","This game is a little overhyped. It is fun but rather easy to finish unless you try for every coin in the game.There's a good variety of enemies and bosses, but the boss battles are too easy. The levels are very creative, my favorite part about the game.The powerups are rather impractical. I ended up using fire power for 90% of the game.The game is overpriced considering there's minimal replay value, just mini games."
5,Super Mario the Best,"I got this game on my birthday last December and right when I started playing it I thought it was awesome and I still think it's awesome. I think Mario is really fun. By the way, I am 8 years old!!! I like the parts when Mario gets really BIG!!!"
5,Super great game!,"I love this game. It has many educational things in it. It is fun, exciting, and GREAT. It really is Super.pros: New features, Better Quality, new minigames and many more.Cons: Well I think there is no cons, but that is just me.So buy this game if you enjoy it, because as a 12 year old I should know that it is good."
4,Great new twist on a classic story…,"I've been playing Super Mario ever since I could hold a controller in my hands and I have loved it ever since. This game as a brand-new story features a classic cast of some of the world's most recognizable video game faces.The levels are fun and not too difficult.Great for casual gamers, but can get a little boring for hard-core gamers.I would recommend this to anybody who's looking for a fun time."
5,New Super Mario for DS,My 5 year grandson loves this game. He was so surprised to get it for Xmas along with the ds player.
5,Love this game!!,"This is mine and my son's favorite ds game. It's the same format as the wii version and so much fun! My son will stay busy and quiet for a long time playing this game. If you can get it for a good price, even better! happy dsinn!"
4,"They aren't redesigning the wheel, but it's a solid game experience.","My six year old daughter plays the game well, but it is challenging for a 30 year gamer. The game play is nostalgic, but with new twists that add to the experience and do not detract. It is not a port of the Wii version. I fully recommend this game."
5,Nice and fun!!,"Not only for me but for my whole family was great and fun, easy for the young ones and extremely surprising with the new contents for the old gamers!! You can really have a good time with this game!!"
5,Two Thumbs Up!!,"My brother and I got this game yesterday and we can't stop playinng it! It's completely addicting!The perilous Bowser Jr. has kidnapped Princess Peach and its up to our favorite hero to stop him. You venture through 8 different worlds filled with your well-known Mario villians, find secret places, try your luck at the Toad House, and even become a Mega Mario!The graphics are sharp, clear, and the two screens are easy to use (the top is your playing screen while your bottom is your map/item/score screen). It is a little hard to control Mario with the keys at first, but you have to get the hang of it. That is the only bad part though.This game is one of the best DS games yet, and it is well worth $35!"
4,Well... it is fun... but very hard,"This game it's really fun, and long. I like it, but, it's very hard! If you thought that getting all the shine sprites was hard, well, think of this game too!! It has new power ups that are really fun!! You have to find three coin stars in every world and can be used buy passage through barricades. The game since the beginning,so if you have problems with your anger, don't buy it!!! Because it will get the dark side of you!!!"
3,"Disappointing, too easy.","I was excited about the New Super Mario Bros., having played the Mario series since the early days of Nintendo. The graphics on this latest game are great, gameplay is fun, but the levels are far too easy. It almost seems dumbed down. It's been a long time since I've played Mario and I'm not a particularly great player, but I was through with this game in only a few hours.EDIT: I wrote this as a twenty-something year old casual gamer who grew up playing original Nintendo games. This game is probably great for younger kids who may be the target audience."
4,daughter age 10 loved it,"my daughter loved it for Christmas for her dsi. It was a bit strange the way it arrived, first Fedex then switched to USPS... so I was sweating it to arrive before Christmas, but thankfully I tracked it down at the Post office. Thanks very much."
4,Wow! Mario Returns,"A got New Super Mario Bros. for Christmas. This game has great graphics, surround sound, and of course Mario! The only complaint I could think of is that the game is easy. I finished it in 6 days. But it is still fun to replay levels that still contain Star Coins or Level-ups [Star Coins are power-ups that let you unlock toad houses and new levels]. Overall I think this game is worth buying!"
4,SO much fun!,"This is an updated version of the Super Mario Bros for Super Nintendo. It has better graphics, more powers, and a whole lot of fun! If you enjoyed Super Mario for NES, then you will love this game!"
4,It's worth buying it !,"I think this game is awesome, I'm a 19-year old player and I've had so much fun playing it. Read below :Pros:- The worlds are great- The mini games are great- The music and sound are kinda cool !- Graphis are cool tooCons :- In general, this game is kinda short ! But for younger players, you might take a longer while to finish it.- My touch pad is a little bit screwed up, so I've had problems troughout the game when trying to touch it to get a new item. But if yours is Ok, then go ahead and buy it. This one worths it !!"
5,Mario Game,"My kids found Mario on YouTube. I have a DS, so when I told them we could find a game for it they went wild. They love playing it(even though they can't make it past the first level yet). They are 7 and 5 years old, but can play it good. My husband and I remember Mario from our youth and will play after they go to bed. I love that it helps them learn to think ahead."
5,This game really takes me back!,"I bought this game for my daugher's Nintendo DS and it is fabulous! A friend told me it was really similar to the ""old"" Super Mario Bros and that his daughter can't put it down. Honestly I didnt mind if for some reason my daughter didnt like the game because I play it all the time! It turns out she does love it and I can help her because a lot of the things in this game are the same as the original version. I remember when we first got our Nintendo and my brothers and sister and I would play for hours. This game is awesome. I love it!"
5,"mario is mario, what more you need to know? uh?","well remember like in 82 where super mario bros came out? do you remember how cool and fun it was? well this one you can take it anywhere and have better graphics of course and some niu items and it follows that good old game style, its fun, its mario, its nintendo."
5,"Great Mario Classic Style, but no Yoshi :(","Overall, I love this game, its my favorite for the DS. Some parts are very difficult...like opening World 4 & 7, and one big dissapointment is that Yoshi was not included in this game at all. What's up with that Nintendo? Anyways, this game is totally fantastic overall, and the mini-games can be great, especially if you're on a break at your job, and you want something to do besides stare at the wall :)"
5,Awesome for all ages. My 3 year old loves it,I have played the Nintendo Wii game and this one and both of them are probably the best Mario game out there. I have a 3 year old son and he willplay this game without any help for over 1 hbour. Relief to me and I myself played until I beat the game. Fun for the whole family.
3,"It's me, Mario!",The game was in excellent condition and everything that it was said to come with was there in place. I bought the game new and it was clearly re packaged by the looks of the cheap shrink wrap. I'm not upset because the condition of the game was perfect but it was almost as deceiving as buying a new game from GameStop.
3,Fun but easy,"This is a good mario game ill give Nintendo that , but it was alot easier compared to the original game. I loved the mini games , the camera , graphics , etc. But i really think they should have made it alot harder then it was."
5,Good game,This game is excellent! its fun to play and even though its like the original you feel like your playing an entire diffrent game.This game also have new powerups like a koopa shell and a mini mushroom. This is a great game and everyone with a ds should get it.
1,did not work,THE GAME YOU SEND ME DOSE NOT WORK WHY THE HELL ARE YOU SALE GAME THAT DONT WORK I DONT KNOW HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE MY MONEY BACK I WANT IT NOW
5,new super mario bros,huy im doing a review on new super mario bros this is realy fun its about mario and the princes going on a walk and then bowser jr kidnapes her and marios qeust begins get a giant mushroom and be giant mario or grab a turtel shell and be turtel mario yup its fun i give it 5 stars so buy it now and get your mario on here we go
1,fake copy of the game,There are alot of fake/ bootleg copys of nintendo ds and game boy advance games sold online. Be careful when buying games online. Also i am shocked that when people have posted warnings about this problem their reviews have been marked not helpful. Thats crazy. How is informing and warning you of something not helpful ?
2,Rent Only!!,This game sucked. I rented it through Gamefly and 10 minutes after getting it I was on World 3 out of 8. I am only 10. Too easy and not enough levels.
2,A Portable Old School Mario with excellent Graphics,"Those are the only two pros of this game. If you want to play the classic NES Mario games on your DS, then buy this. If you want a challenge or something new and different, then do not buy this. You will be sorely disappointed.This is the same stale gameplay that plagues many generic platformers today, no matter what console. Just because it is Mario does not make it any better. The worlds themselves are mostly recycled, with some variances, from Super Mario 3. The boss battles are exactly the same. The only time the touch screen is even used for the gameplay is if you want to use the power up you have saved.With the incredible potential this game had, it is wasted on rehashing the old NES games with better graphics. Once again, buy this only if you want a portable NES Mario game. Everyone else, stay away."
1,"fun, for a week tops","i got this game for my birthday some time ago. at first i was amazed at how fun this game was. I don't play video games much so i played it on and off for about a week or so, After that week i turned the game on and played it. I passed world one and then I was shocked, what happened? the little monsters are just annoying, The spiked one was the one that drove me insane, I jumped clear over it and the game ended, I was sent back at least three stages. here are some things that annoy me* the graphics are not-so-great.* it just does downhill after the first world* bowser is too easy to beat in the first world large castle (you just jump over him)* How everytime you loose all your lives you loose your progress. (i was on world eight the big castle and lost all my progress and was sent back to the little castle)i don't get why this game is so horrible. The wii version is so much betterSPENT FIFTEEN DOLLARS MORE FOR THE WII VERSION ITS BETTER!!!!!"
1,Why does everyone like this game??,"This game isn't very different than Super Mario Bros so I was dissapointed to find that the new Super Mario Bros was almost exactly the same as the regular Super Mario Bros. I really don't like this game. The only thing that I like is the multiplayer, I get to play with my friends and family, they like it. I don't reccomend playing this game unless you use it for multiplayer. Don't play this game."
1,what happened?,"Decent game for young kids. But what happened to levels 4 and 7. What a rip off, why not just have six levels then to skip two levels of fun? And the 20 coins that are used and could be used for extra levels at the end of the game just serve for a new background and decoration. Worst game of the series. Still good but the worst. Hope the next one isn't such a lazy atttempt. Cheers"
1,Terrible game for a terrible system,This game is one of the many failures of mario recently. It is fitting it was a made for a system as bad as the ds.
4,Games to play at every age,I like the game very much even though I do not have as much time as I would like to have to play.
5,very good Mario game,Took me three hours to beat and im still playing trying to unlock secret stuff. A great bow the the origionals and a great new mario atmosphere and monsters to fight. amazing new graphics and power up's too!
5,Mario rulez all!,"This game is definitely by far one of the best mario games I've ever seen. It has all kinds of kool new features that keep it alive, like mario growing huge and destroying everything in his path. Would definitely recommend this title to Anyone!"
5,Bought for Nintedo DS Original,"I absolutley love Mario and when I got a used original Nintendo DS, I immediatley purchased the game. It was everything I expected and worked perfectl on my ancinet model."
5,9 yr old loves it,My son got this game and hasn't stopped playing it since it showed up. He's always telling me about the multi-levels and what he's having a hard time defeating. Must be good!
3,"Meh...Mario, you've done better","It may be just me, but this game frustrated me to no end. I grew up playing Mario games and I can't remember having so much difficulty. I'm sure that if I gave it a little bit more time, I could fly through it. But right now, I'm sulking in a corner, glaring at the cartridge as it sits nonchalantly on my carpet."
3,"Great Mario game, but a little short","My sister and I played this game, we really enjoyed, the addition of the Big and little Mushrooms where great as they open a whole new world in the Mario adventures.I just feel the whole game is kind of short, I was able to finish the whole game in two days (some friends have finished in 4 hours), and I'm not that good.I was expecting more powers and more complex story line and this game doesn't deliver that."
3,this game is a mixed bag.,"first of all, (in a nice way) Mario games are boring and are not very hard.(unless you get to the final boss) so i bought it, played it, had fun, and was bored in week. this game is sometimes fun but it has litte replay value. some of the powers are cool looking though. if i were you i would RENT this game before you buy itotherwise, get MPH it has good multiplayer but bad single player, so it's a good idea to buy this game if you like single player better :)enjoy your purchase."
2,Bad camera angles,"I played this on the orginal console and wasn't a big fan of it then. I really don't like how the camera is set up, it makes me feel dizzy and want to vomit after playing for two minutes. So no, I've never beat the game. My hubby bought this for me, but had more fun with it than I did. Maybe if there was a way to fix the camera so it wasn't shifting all the time, it would be a better game. But I did enjoy the mini games."
3,Good game but...,"This is a good game but my son did not get it on time for Christmas due to the bad customer service on Amazon; they just charged my credit card but did not send my purchase, I have to send several emails to finally get them."
2,mario game,"I was very un-happy with this product. The game was shown as a new game, if not I would had both it at another web site. It came without a box and without the book. How do you expect someone to use the game without the book to know the elements of the game? This experience made me think twice about buying at your web site again. I was buying something believing it was new, to get something used. I can tell you this, my birthday is coming and I ask the family that used to use this site not to get me a gift card this time. Thank you Silvia"
5,Same Old Mario,"This is a standard mario game. The DS double screens allow for some fun extra features like back up items and a scale of how far through a level you are. The game only takes about 8 hours to beat, but it is still very fun. If you love Mario you'll love this. If you want a game thats hard to beat you maybe disappointed."
5,"Great game, stands the test of time","Along with Mario Kart this is one of the best games we've ever gotten for our son. It continues to be fun no matter how many months (or years) go by, and it doesn't get old. It's very fun to play with other DS's and it's one of my son's all time favorites. I don't think ALL the Mario games are created equal but this is one of the best."
3,very solid and very short,"As you can expect, a platformer designed for the ds works beautifully....only a few buttons are needed and the directional pad (as opposed to a joystick) works just splendidly. The physics are great (seems to have a bit more emphasis on momentum than the original Mario Bros) and the colors/characters made me quite happy (as expected). However, this game was just TOO short and TOO easy. I would think that they could easily fit many more worlds or varying difficulties onto that ds cartridge but, alas, they did not, which makes me think this game is a bit overrated and overpriced."
5,My kids can play this for hours!,My kids own tons of games and this is always the first choice. I think it's a great choice of Mario.
5,Super Mario Bros,I was so glad that I bought two of this game. Kep the grand children intertained for hours. Even the adults were playing this one.
4,"Run, Jump, and Save the Princess","When i saw the ad for this game i knew it would rock, and some of it did. I bought this game a month after it was released and I was really happy to own a fourth Mario Bros game. Here are my Pros and Cons.Pros.1. Graphics are perfect2. Kept the old charm3. Story is always the same but with Bowser Jr.4. Items and villans are new and old5. a good challengeCons1. Can't save unless you buy a Toad house or finish a Boss or get a new world2. Can't be Luigi (only in VS mode)3. Needs more minigames4. Hard to unlock stuff (they give no hints)5. Overdid the music sometimesI know there's alot but other than that if you just got your Nintendo DS lite get this game!"
5,As fun as the originals.,"I was so happy to see Mario back where he belonged, in side scroller. The new features were great, such as the super sized Mario and the micro mini Mario, and the minigames were great as well. After I beat the regular game, I mainly just kept playing the minigames, which has kept me entertained for months."
5,New Super Mario is Super for DS,"After getting addicted to New Super Mario Bros for Wii, I was excited to see it available for my DS and hoped it would match up for ""on the go Mario"". It does! It is lots of addictive fun and very much like the Wii game with a few minor changes. Still has similar worlds to conquer and a few fun differences like when you get a giant Mario who can take care of everything. If you like Mario Bros...and you liked the NEW one on Wii, you will love this!"
4,Ok game,"It's an ok game for those interested in platforming games. Somewhat frustrating when you have to go all the way to midpoint in order to save your progress.Overall, it's a fun game and good for those who loved the Mario series throughout the console's history."
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday, he loves it!!! It's a great!!! Great game!!! Wat a good buy!"
5,Classic fun,My 12 yr old son has thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has given him hours of fun. Would highly recommend for Mario fans.
4,Very Happy Daughter,"My 9 year old daughter purchased this with a gift card that she received from her grandparents for Christmas. She has been begging for this game for months. Unbeknowst to her, I WAS going to get it for her for her birthday in February, anyways, she found this on Amazon for an EXCELLENT price! She was happy and if the kids are happy, Momma's happy! :) The game was shipped and delivered promptly. Would def buy from again!"
3,Disappointing,"I was expecting a lot more out of this game in terms of gameplay, innovation, and play time.My main problem with New Super Mario Brothers for Nintendo DS is that it doesn't bring anything new to the table. I like the game's retro appeal, but after a couple of levels I was already bored with the game. (Un)fortunately, the levels are all fairly short and not particularly challenging, and it's possible to beat the game in about 5 hours.While the game isn't horrible to play, the entertainment appeal just doesn't last because bosses, levels, and the play style quickly become repetitive.That said, the game looks fantastic and the controls are fairly precise. This Mario title could have been a knockout if only for a little more innovation and diversity."
4,lots of fuuun!,"this game is definately a classic!i love playing this game on my nintendo ds, though i havnt played in a while because my brother snapped my old nintendo ds in half. typical autisim ;-).anyway, once i get my new ds for christmas, which is a ds lite and coral pink (i peeked, dont tell please :D ) i will definately start playing again. i am on the last world. yay! my favorite part is playing picture poker and other card mini games. its very fun! only reason i gave this game an overall 4 stars is because the story line is a little old ( bowser stealing princess peach) and also it doesnt let you save unless you purchase a toad house (5 stars) or reach half point in the world or finish the world :(. but, despite that, this is a great game! buy it nooooow!"
3,"Fun, but not worth it","If you own SM64 DS, then I wouldn't bother even whipping out your wallet for this game.While the game may be fun, the game itself is way to easy to beat. First time I played, I beat it in less than 45 minutes.The mini games are the only thing that make this game fun.Overall:7/10Too easy for its own goodMy recommendation:Don't buy both Mario games. You'll find out that this is a waste of money otherwise."
2,"COME ON, NINTENDO! YOU CAN DO BETTER!","Clearly not alot of people agree with me about what I'm going to say...This game was ALOT of fun until you beat Bowser in his giant world 8 castle. Then for me, it got soooooooooo boring. The minigames are pointless, cheap, and just plain BORING. The layout is similar to the original. Overall, the Super Mario Bros. series is one of Nintendo's best... and that's the only reason they got away with this blow............."
1,didnt receive it,i dont how good it is because i never received it on my purchases it says it was delivered last week with christmas here please tell me they just didnt leave it on my porch and its a gift 4 my child i am so disappointed i never had any problem before now please help me
5,Welcome back Mario!!,"I LOVE this game! I won't bother giving it a detailed review since over 100 people have already given it good reviews. I've been playing it daily! Great graphics & colors!The only downside is the 'save' part. How do you save after you're done playing? I had to keep playing and playing and everytime I wanted to 'quit', it would tell me I would lose my unsaved data! I found out you can save only if you complete a castle, tower, spend your coins OR BEAT THE GAME! I finally beat the game! And I can save anytime I want to! That's your reward! I suggest you go try beat the game, then once you're done, you can go back, take your time collecting the coins and save everytime you do. The ending of the game was great!In order to get to worlds 4 and 7, you need to beat the browser in the last castles as a tiny mario in worlds 2 and 5.Wonderful game! Kids and adults love it!"
5,Great,I love it and both my kids love it. And it keeps challenging us over and over and we've had it for a whole year!
4,New Super Mario Bros,"We bought this game for my son for Christmas and my wife has already completed all levels of the game. It has been a lot of fun for both my wife and son. If you like the original, I would definitely recommend this game."
3,Good album,"I do like me some Alabama - and this collection has most of their best. However, if you don't LOVE Alabama, it gets to be a little too much after a while. Not one of those CDs I can play over & over again."
1,Ultimate Alabama 20 # 1 Hits,Only 10 songs were downloaded for a 20 song album. It has not been replaced or refunded. The automatic problem submital is confusing.
5,can't go wrong,"Alabama spoke for the common folks. You just can't go wrong with these guys. There's a reason they're classic! Good music, good words, there just isn't a bad thing anyone can say about Alabama."
5,Awesome,"If you like\love, Alabama, then this recording of, ""Ultimate Alabamas' 20 greatest hit's, is the one for you.I know you will love it, as much as I do.Jake"
4,Alabama,"Not a great fan of this group, but ther are some tracts that I like to listen to once in a while. It gives me something country that I can play for others that don't make me gag."
5,ULTIMATE ALABAMA 20#1 HITS,"ALABAMA has some awesome country music, we love the older music, it is easy to understand and it has a great beat, thank you amazon!"
4,nice,I have always liked alabama and this album contains many of my favorite songs seems to play well on kindle
5,Alabama at their best,"i have followed this amazing group since the first started on the west coast. caught them the first time on one of those ""star search"". saw them twice in one evening at Knotts Berry Farm. I was hooked. their songs go right to your heart and bring back childhood memories."
3,"The cuts are terrific, but...","An outstanding collection. 'Nuff said.But the engineer responsible for setting the digital recording level should be forced to listen to this disc every day for all eternity. A travesty.(if that means nothing to you, the translation is: it sounds pretty awful)"
3,Strong start but weak follow through,"After blowing his big Vegas debut, an aspiring comic (Oliver Platt) returns to the English seaside carnival town where he grew up to find a new act from among the performers who live there. Among the quirky characters he encounters is a maladjusted young man (Lee Evans) who just might be some kind of comic genius. This film starts well (with a kind of ""Local Hero"" vibe to it) and has a fantastic cast, but the various subplots become awkward and don't mesh well. It's fun to see Jerry Lewis doing a dramatic turn."
1,"Awfull,Awfull,YUCK......BLAH...","I don't like to use the word hate but if I did this would be where I'd use it,I struggled through the entire thing & the only even interesting parts were a magic act & mabey a few bits & pieces that I can't even remember and I just watched it alittle while ago.Between the Rave Reviews & Jerry Lewis being in it I thought it had to be at least Good,but I was Disapointed at best,I felt it was more like a Woody Allen humor & I'm so not into his type of humor,but that's just My Opion..."
3,A DARK FAMILY DRAMA (IT WAS'T *SUPPOSED* TO BE A COMEDY),"Just because a movie has Jerry Lewis and a title that includes ""Funny"" doesn't mean that it was supposed to be a comedy! The plot is a bit of a mix (about a stand-up legend and his failure of a son) and doesn't always work.The main bit about the father and the son, and the secrets and desires around them, is all worth watching. But we get hit by these little loose strands about a mob boss and a stolen wax egg that never seem to fit in with the rest of the theme and are hence left to fizzle off half-baked.Acting etc is all fine, but the script is doozy and the screenplay patchy, which may work for some (who like ""different cinema"") but it is not youe average comedy yarn. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could."
5,Great CD -- Great Value,"This is a nearly perfect CD. The songs are wonderful examples of Lombardo's style (respect for the melody, articulate lyrics, smooth presentation), and most are not seen on his other CDs. The audio reproduction is first class. However, be aware that this is a duplicate of a Hindsight CD put out several years ago. But if you missed purchasing that Hindsight CD, you should not make the same mistake twice, and you should grab this one. On top of the quality of the CD, it is listed at a great price. This is a welcome addition to the growing catalogue of Lombardo CDs. Well done Swing Factory! What would make it perfect? It would be nice if it were longer (it comes in at 38 minutes, 19 seconds)."
5,Everything like I thought it would be,Just what you would expect from an Ernest movie. Classic Ernest getting shoes that teachkids a lesion about it taking time and practice to get good at something.
3,OK for Jim Varney Fans.,"This is not one of the best ""Ernest"" movies, but worth watching if you are a Jim Varney fan. Which I am."
2,Definitely the worst Ernest movie.,"I gave it two stars for Varney's performance because he always put his heart and soul into the Ernest character, but not even that could redeem this mess of a film.There are two styles of comedy going on here and they don't mesh together real well. First you have the Ernest character who is a comedy gem all by himself and needs no enhancing, then you have the fantasy element of the Arch-Angel of Basketball giving Ernest the ""Magic Sneakers"".The best part of the movie was Ernest's early interactions with the other guys on his clean-up crew and his attempts to be one of the guys. Instead of solving things with sneakers they should have have had a series of scenes with Kareem Abdul Jabaar as a sympathetic gym owner or even a janitor teaching Ernest how to play ball, now that would have been hilarious.This is only a must have if you want to get them all, otherwise just get ""Scared Stupid"" and ""Goes To Jail""."
4,laughter is the best medicine,i purchased this movie for my two kids for x-mas. my youngest son has not laughed this hard in a long time.he repeatedly watchs the movie and i get the same reaction.
5,Ernst Rules!!!!!!,"My daughter is probly Jim Varneys biggest fan. She dressed up in a wedding dress at the age of 2 yrs old and was waiting for Ernst to get out of Jail so he could marry her. She is now 11 yrs old and she just found her Dad dead last year, it is my desire to find out Jim Varney's address so that she could write her dream man and maybe get her dream come true-a letter from the man of her life. She is true blue to him. Has all of his movies memorized. Please someone help me find Jim Varney's address, please!!!!! My e-mail is barb@favorites.com Please make my baby's dream come true her birthday is Oct 6th and I would like to supprise her by then! Thanks"
2,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT?","THIS TIME, ERNEST [JIM VARNEY] IS A SHOPPING MALL JANITOR WHO DREAMS OF BEING A BASKETBALL PLAYER, BUT HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO SKILLS IN THE GAME WHATSOEVER. UNTIL, HE FINDS A PAIR OF SHOES THAT ENABLE HIM TO POSESS PERFECT SKILLS. WELL, IT'S NOT MUCH. BUT, IT'S A DEFINITE STEP UP FROM ERNEST GOES TO SCHOOL. FORMER NBA SUPERSTAR KAREEM ABDUL JABAR APPEARS IN THIS MOVIE AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER. UP BY THIS TIME, ERNEST MOVIES STOPPED GOING TO THEATRES AND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE SERIES IS GETTING OLD. FOLLOWED BY ERNEST GOES TO AFRICA."
2,The worst Ernest movie.,"I found the magic sneeakers plot very stupid. I'm sorry Jim (may you rest in peace), but this one was one I looked forward too and it was a let down. But I'l still watch it, just because it's an Ernest movie. Sorry Mr./Mrs. barb@favorites.com, but in case you haven't heard, Jim Varney died earlier this year. I know it's sad, I'm still mourning over it. Maybe the people who made the Ernest movies will come to their senses and rerelease the Ernest movies in his memory. Or maybe he finished Ernest the Pirate before he died and release that."
3,Ernest...Enough Said!,"Indeed, this is not the best Ernest film that has ever been created, but it is still an Ernest film. Once again, Jim Varney plays Ernest, the clumsey man who has all the good intentions in the world and saves the day in the end. It's funny, you never picture Ernest as a basketball player and this movie proved that he isn't lol! The movie, as in his previous films, has good heart. If you are a fan of Ernest, you should at least check this film out. I'm not recommending that you buy it just yet. Compared to some of his other movies, the movie doesn't compare to greats such as Ernest Goes to Jail. Still, I can't help but feel a little sad now that Jim has passed and we no longer have Ernest to save the day. It was a great legacy, and the character is portrayed very weil in this film. The story is sadly just not much to work with."
2,BAD compared to his earlier movies,"Slam Dunk Ernest isn't that good, it's a total disapointment compared the Ernest Saves Christmas and Ernest Goes to Jail (my favorite Ernest movie). But it does have some funny parts but the bad parts are when Ernest's girlfriend doesn't turn out the way she seems and when the basketball players are mean to Ernest. Only recommended to diehard Ernest fans."
2,This is only HALF of the volume!,"I have not seen only half of a volume sold before, but that is what you get if you buy this...so you can either get the WHOLE volume for $18 from another listing or buy the two halves for $30 total. Since this is the first time I've experienced a volume sold this way, I was hugely disappointed when I opened it and only 2 discs where in the envelope, especially since this is a birthday gift for my son. SUPER bummed."
4,"Imaginative, time-tested","This second WW album was recorded with a bass player who came at the end of an array of ""fill-ins"" that sat in following the first album, and who had the group add another drummer. Still, the remaining original members created some very imaginative, time-tested music in keeping with the first album. WW disbanded after this album. So, don't confuse the cd (Power) put out by the later, much less imaginative Pittsburgh band with real WW music."
5,stupid header,"The essence of white witch, a group which transcended boundries between many forms of music. It has a beauty and flow that somehow joins deep purple and tommy james and the shondels."
4,memories,"I am 43 years old and have been looking for this for a looonnngg time. It sure does bring back the memories and make me feel like a teenager again. Just hearing it makes a person think about the things we did back then. I can hear my dad saying ""How can you listen to that noise??"" and I say that to my kids referring to today's ""music"""
4,Great Old Jams,"This was one of the coolest albums around when I was a kid.Myself and a small group liked new and obscure music out of the main steam and this has always been one the most memorable.I saw them live in 1974 at a place called Treasure Land by Busch Gardens Tampa.I`ve been looking for this for a long time.So glad to see it finally released on CD.Sounds Great.I had it on a 8 track tape way back then.Their first album is great too,but I always liked A Spiritual Greeting the best"
2,Life-less forms,"2 1/2Tales of Ephidrina, recorded under art-electro FSOL's other title, clearly can be considered a B-sides disc to the hugely successful, ambitious ambiance of Lifeforms- using much of the same sonic palate, though without much of the finely honed production work."
4,Not up to Lifeforms,"All round, ToE is good. It's more dance focused than Lifeforms, which put me off a bit, because I loved that distorted, sample-heavy style. However, don't let that stop you from getting both, cause both are worthwhile. Be sure to get the FSOL Lifeforms : Paths 1-7 EP. It's only a few bucks and you get 40 more mins of ambient goodness (the song ""Lifeforms"" makes a reappearance in the EP too)."
5,"Loking Good, Ok, Goodby","This is a Great Electronic/Techno CD. 8 Tracks. 47 min. NO. 1 Cd Under Amorphous Androgynous, but this is not the same music like thay do in FSOL. This one is more ""harder"", if we cut say that, than FSOL do. I realy like this CD....b.t.w If someone Whoud like to sell me or tell me where I can By the CD by Amorphous Androgynous - Environments then cut you E-Mail me at helgipal@mmedia.is"
2,Not a classic.,"At this moment in time(Oct. 2005)and for people familiar with electronica in it's many variations, the sound on this release is dated. Not destined to be a classic."
3,ok ok,So so. I can't say much though because i am not a very big fan of F.S.O.L. But for 1993 its good.
2,This one is a dud,Lot's of samplers from startup bands. Mostly daytime (small unknown bands). Disjointed concert DVD. The Bonus disk is a joke. Get Austin City 2004 instead.
2,The Marvin CD is sweet,"The covers are watery, paper thin, modern R&B fluff in my opinion. I'm not a fan of modern R&B to start with but I thought that, being a real fan of 70's Marvin, the overall favourable 5 star reviews of this album needed to be balanced by another view of it. The covers are awful elevator music. Admittedly covering Marvin Gaye has to be a supremely difficult task, but I think this album should have had more artists from a variety of styles. Listen first before buying!"
5,Marvin would be proud!!!,"VERY high points were Kenny Lattimore doing Just to keep you satisfied. its like butter. and listening to Joe almost perfect on 'soon i'll be loving you'. i dont think anbody else could pull off lyrics like ""i never gave up no head before"" and ""i'm gonna give you some head baby"". this CD is made for lovin. just look at the artisst, Will Downing, sure love to ball, fagetaboutit!! the only thing better is the real Marvin on these selections!!!"
1,Unimaginative!,"Every single cover hews so close to the great Marvin original, it makes me wonder why any of them bothered to go to the effort. Might as well have stayed home and sung to themselves in the shower. If you're going to create a collection of new recordings of beloved songs by such a brilliant and groundbreaking singer and songwriter as Marvin Gaye, fer chrissakes mess it up and create something new!"
4,Just like the kits you rent from the auto parts store,Great kit. Has all the desired adapters and is easy to use and sturdy. That's enough for me.
5,Disc-Brake Caliper Wind-Back Tool Kit,"Use to change the brakes on my 1999 Ford Mustang, works perfect. Done it 3 times already. Also use to change the brakes on my wife car (Mercedes Benz CLK 350)"
4,Gets the job done,"I spent an entire Sunday trying to replace the rear pads on my '08 VW GTI, going back and forth to Sears and Autozone looking for the right tool. Then I ordered this set and once it arrived I got the job done in just over an hour.The reason I'm not giving five stars is that it is made of low grade metal - it has a good plated finish on it but is low density and feels cheap. And its not high precision, the pins kept slipping off the piston face and I had to reset everything a few times to get the piston all the way in. I would have preferred to pay a few extra bucks for something higher quality that's made in America or Germany, but this is the only thing readily available and is good enough to get the job done."
2,does not fit VW tiguan,"We are keeping them because I'm sure we can use them on one of our other cars, but it doesn't fit a VW Tiguan."
