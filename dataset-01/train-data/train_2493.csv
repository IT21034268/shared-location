4,"Good, convenient way to use your cellphone","I have used this headset with Nokia 6620 as well as Nokia 3300 and they work well. The sound is very clear, while I have never used a volume setting above 3 bars (has 7 bars available).However, sometimes they do not pair well with my device, so I have to turn them off-on in order to work.I have also used them with my laptop, and the sound is great! As for range, I would say that I never had a problem as long as I was within 20 feet. However, if you use them in the house, walking from room to room, pairing will get lost.Have also recently the BT-250v but they did not work as well. A lot of chatter and too much background noise, although I was testing them inside my apt, without any noise at all."
5,Handsome watch,"This is a handsome watch that I purchased as a present. It does not have oodles of bells and whistles but makes up for it as a quality timepiece that manages to look both athletic and professional. The size of the face is great - not too small and not oversized. Overall, I'm very pleased with the quality and good looks of this watch and the recipient of this gift is very happy as well!"
3,Below expectation!,"Certainly not Yaoi, maybe some hints of shounen-ai. Wish these publishing companies will be more responsible in their title classification. For one to 3 hours entertainment, depending on whether we drool over the explicit scenes and artwork, Japanese manga do not come cheap and I wish to be really buying a yaoi manga, which is not so in this case. As a Yaoi/shounen-ai fan I do not like manga with just mild hints of boy love. They may hint but without tension (like the intensity in Yellow), there is nothing to keep me interested in this series. Maybe it will improve down the road but until it does, it is not on my buying list. A pity because this mangaka's artwork is really quite lovely and the plot is not bad."
4,Gorgeous Carat 1: Virtue of Darkness (Yaoi) (v. 1),"It's definitely a good story, not one of my absolute favorites, but definitely worth at least one full read through."
3,Musical Evenings in the Captain's Cabin,I had first purchased the Master and Commander CD and thought this one would have similar music as it's title inferred it was music in the Captain's cabin. But it was totally different to both me and my husband. The music is lovely but not as we'd anticipated.
3,Tiny.,I have a 1992 Honda Accord and this barely covers the windshield. I thought that I had a small car and windshield but this Shade is sooo small. Get the bigger size.
3,Decent but...,My biggest issue with this particular cover that I've never dealt with before is that when you put it in your window it wants to fold back up and falls from under the shine flaps. Other than that the unit does a good job of blocking out the sun and keeping my car a little bit cooler than without using it.
2,Not impressed!,"It won't stay on. Has hooks on the sides, have no idea where I'm suppose to tie them? A friend of mine, bought a sunshade at a local store, much better. It has suction cups, very convenient. This sunshade, i am not impressed. Poorly designed."
3,Fun Missouri Band,"Good solid album by a Missouri band. This is not their best album, but it is their only album on a major label. This is a fun band."
3,"Better Than the Last, But still Flawed","Andrew Vachss lost the thread of his Burke books about five years ago. What he needs is a good editor again to tell him what's working and what isn't. I have to say, though, that he seemed to be getting back on track with this one, although there's about 80 pages of padding. I kept saying to myself, ""Get to it, Vachhs, and stop babbling!"" Finally I gave up and just couldn't finish. Still, I remain a fan of the man's work."
3,see thru swim suit,"so i went swimming at a public pool today and found out the hard way that you can see right through the top part of the dress, but only when it gets wet. it is a very cute swim suit and it gives just the right coverage for being a bigger girl. i just wish that they would put a white piece of fabric up on the top part of the suit so that it would be appropriate to wear at a public pool."
5,As compared to older versions of Premiere,"I am not saying tht I cannot find problems with Premiere, but the old problems that I had with older versions have gone away. The Premiere engine is faster, as long as you have the resources in your pc operating system, Mac or PC. Not having to fool with frame grabber video boards and programs is a big plus. Those that use Premiere 1.5 or lower versions know what I mean. Letting your video camcorder be your frame grabber greatly simplified the process. Using a VHS to DVD type player/recorder in conjunction with a quality camcorder opened many format recording possibilities. I could go on and be more specific, but those that are well acquainted with Adobe Premiere will enjoy the Premiere 2.0 upgrade."
1,Customer Loses Company Battle,"My NLE uses the Canopus Storm Capture software. Canopus was purchased by Grass Valley and severed their support of Adobe products. Canopus claims it was Adobe that severed ties with them. ANYWAY, the Premiere Pro 1.5 was the last to recieve support. There are no drivers for 2.0 and I can't use it. Anyone wanna buy it?"
1,Go to Walmart,"You can buy these straws at any Walmart in America for $.99! I ordered these thinking I would get jumbo red and white striped straws, however, they are regular sized straws that are white/blue striped and white/green striped."
1,verrrrrry heavy straws,How in the WORLD does a package of plastic straws that sells for $1.19 weigh in at 84.24 lbs?????? This is an obvious error that results in shipping charges in excess of $100. No one will be dumb enough to purchase these straws until this is corrected.
3,OK. Not really that useful.,"First, what's with all the bizarre pictures? Not just cartoony but grotesquemisshapen heads and bodies on every page. I don't get that at all.I bought the workbook thinking it would go with the audio CDs, but they don'tgo together at all. Perhaps that's my fault as they don't actually say they do,but with the same cover you would think... ?By itself, I don't think it would be of much use. Filled with German sentences,but without much English translation. I do like when they print the phoneticpronunciation of some words.Maybe I'm being too critical. But I'd go with the audio CDs. They are quite good."
2,it was ok,"The book is ok. I thought it might be more structured and organized, but it seems to have quite a bit of vocabulary for the small book that it is. It is in color, but there are pictures and text all over the place and it's hard to make sense of it all. I ended up ordering the Barron's Mastering French learning set with a book and cassette tapes because I had a German learning set from Barron's and it was very well organized. The Barron's learning system is used to train U.S. diplomatic personnel and is meant to help you speak fluently. I liked that better because I was looking for something to help me learn the language thouroughly, explain the grammar and teach me more than a little vocabulary and some phrases."
4,Great Book!,"Honestly, this is the best book I've ever read onself-confidence.It really helps and doesn't waste your time by uselesstalking. Each chapter takes around 15 minutes to read butI think exercises take some more time.I'm going to read it again and again, many helpful lessonsare there."
4,good book,it tells you somethings that you can do which are really helpful. The tips that you get from it are not all necessary
2,"Only for phD student studying ""confidence""","This book talks on all the types and definitions on confidence. If you want to write an exam on confidence, get this book. I could not read more than half of this stuff! :-(....For me it was too much of theory."
1,This is a joke !!,"This book is a joke to anyone who takes himself/herself seriously and actually wants to improve their confidence. It is bad writing, so badly written that a college paper is more complex and the psychological knowledge behind it is to be questioned. This is the perfect example of a guy who wants to make some quick cash out of the sale of one of his many books. How did this even get published? There are really talented and knowledgeable people out there who don't get published and this guy managed to get his book published? Sorry Dr. Tim, I'm not buying it!"
1,did cokin stopped making this ?,how come suddenly the price shot up to 755 from 300 ? is there no other manufacturer who can make a frame less CPL of the same dimensions ?seriously ? 755 for a CPL ????is there any way we can buy a normal CPL and remove its frame to fit the Z-Pro system ?
2,Not for Children,I got these for my 5 year old niece and 4 year old nephew. My nephew can sometimes shoot the gun (he is very muscular) and my niece can not shoot it at all (she is tiny). You have to have a good amount of arm strength to shoot these. They have like a pump-n-shoot style and a lot of resistance. They are more for a 10 year old boy or older. After awhile the pump-n-shoot gets kind of old too.
2,deceptive box,The box says for ages 6 and up. The gun uses an air pressure pop-gun type mechanism to fire the balls.I don't think there are many 6 year olds on the planet who can make this gun fire. You have to manually pump up enough pressure to force the balls to pop out. It takes way too much strength for young kids.Overall the toy was a big disappointment to our kids. It would probably be a fine toy for kids over 8.I would have no problem with this item if the packaging was more honest.
4,Christmas for Triplets,"We gave our four and a half year old triplets the nerf guns for Christmas and they played with them all day and have been playing with them most of the time since. We instructed them to never shoot at each other, and so far they have followed the instructions. They have had fun setting up targets in their basement and seeing who can be the best shooter. Seems to have been a fine gift."
4,Plain safe fun,"Although this is not a true educational toy, it is a safe way to teach children about handling a gun without them or our house being destroyed. It is a load of fun and has provided hours of delight for grandchildren and their friends at our home. It seems that shooting a gun is a natural curiosity for children and this has provided an avenue for that curiosity. Of course, the Nerf toys have always been a preference for us and so one more is always welcome. There does not seem to be an age range for this item!! Even grandpa gets in on the fun."
3,OK gun,"this gun is good in close range (but terrible in far range which is my preference). Although this gun isn't of my expectations it's really fun to have in a nerf war. Overall, I give this gun 3 stars,"
4,May be difficult for small children...,"We bought this for our 3 year old son, he was really excited when he saw his dad shoot the balls. However, when he tried to shoot...he couldn't. There is just too much resistance. Even I have difficulty sometimes. Probably better for larger children, or adults who like to behave like kids every now and then. :o)"
3,"Inaccurate, but scares people to death....","I play a lot of nerf wars, and I picked up this gun to be used as a grenade launcher.It worked, but I never actually hit anyone with the balls. It's great for scaring people who don't know how accurate it is (not very) but that's about it. You also need a bit of strength to shoot it."
1,Not for small children,Bought this for my 6 yr old grandson. It is too difficult to pull it back. I could not easily do it either. Taking it back today.
2,Not a good ball gun,"I don't understand why Nerf made this such a poor gun. It is one of the worst ball guns I've used. The distance is poor, as is the accuracy. If you just want to be amused, then buy this gun. Don't buy this gun for Nerf war. ... get a Ballzooka. Even the Ripsaw is better than these blasters.They are useful as a cheap confusion device... unload a couple of these puppies as your team mates move in for the kill."
1,Bodybuilder needed to operate this toy!,"It was impossible for my 8 year old grandson to operate this toy. The foam balls fit so tightly in the chamber that it takes Herculean strength to get them to pop out. He had to hold the blaster against his abdomen and use both hands to try to fire the balls, and he still couldn't do it. Even the adults present had a hard time with it. Nerf toys have always been pretty good, but pick another model or style of Nerf blaster. All this toy does is aggravate the user."
2,Nerf Blaster,They say NERF or nothing this rather a big Nothing. This you can shoot hardley any where. It's okay for close range but if you shoot someone while you are hiding it just give you away.
4,maximum shoottage,"I loved it. It was great in high combat battle and target pactice, but its a little hard to load. Still I recomind it."
2,great for boys 10+,"This gun is awesome! The problem I have is that I bought it for my four year old. The gun is very hard to shoot, even my eight year old couldn't shoot it. It is really fun (I would know since I've had to shoot it so much for the kids) but only for older kids. It has loosened up a bit in the part 3 months, bit still isn't the easiest to use."
3,Not for 4-year-olds,"My son is a strong, athletic, coordinated 4-year-old, but this style of Nerf gun was too difficult for him to shoot. It requires a good amount of velocity for the balls to come shooting out of it."
4,Air Tech Ball Blaster,"This is one of the best ball blasters Nerf has ever made. However, this guns accuracy isn't the greatest and it will often jam if it has just one ball in it. Other than that, you should buy this gun."
1,Not for children,"This toy requires the child to pump the handle in order to shoot the balls out. The only person in the house that has fun with this is my husband, as he is the only one that can use it with little effort."
2,don't get it,If your gonna get a toy gun for you or your kids get a Super Soaker there way more fun and you don't lose the darts or the air balls cause there is none the only thing you might lose is one of those quick fills for the splashzooka or the Monster series. So take this advice because I own like 10 SuperSoakers and one of these NERF things and I hate it.Don't get IT
3,In the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes.,"I originally read this book in hard back 30 years ago. The revised paper back edition will appeal to Sherlock Holmes aficianados but some of the author's theories are rather fanciful and his views have since been overtaken by more recent research into the wilder shores of Sherlockiana.The paperback I read was printed on poor quality paper which has browned and become crumbly, so anybody buying a used copy needs to be aware of its likely condition."
3,It's OK.,"It's worth it for ""Keep It Coming"", but if you are not a Heavy D fan, I suggest that you don't buy it because it's kinda boring. I still haven't listened to side B."
4,GET THIS! /LISTEN/DON'T MISS IT/SALE ON AISLE 3/GET YOURS,"""Yo this album tighter than fat chicks spandex marks left on their stomach after a set of crunches/These are x-marks for punches/Trained to kill emcees in bunches for practice/Cutting cats in half like fractions/Slow reaction/Let me come back then/Hit you once again for askin stupid questions/This album bring more heat then ""Charleston Heston"" and ""Al Pacino"" in one of his ""Godfather"" roles but in a ""Western"" era/Album covers all areas/It's his best yet"" - Dimpals a.k.a.

2,Stale,Buyers beware that some food products that you buy may be out of date or have a small hole in the packaging that dries out the contents.
3,BASSETTSt All-sorts Licorice via Amazon,"Bassettss is commonly regarded as THE premium brand of all-sorts type licorice, originated in the UK. In this particular purchase, I was disappointed with the quality. To me, it seemed stale and lacking in the taste I remembered. I would not buy it again via Amazon."
1,what's with the coconut?,"There's no ""all-sort"" in these Allsorts. They don't even taste like licorice, and there is virtually no variety. The bag is fresh but the contents just taste like rancid coconut. The colors are not as bright as they used to be. The pieces have gotten larger, perhaps to make up for their lack of taste (?). Nope, this is definitively not 'candy I ate as a kid.'"
2,Screenplay Masked in a Metaphor,"The central metaphor of this debut novel surrounds the theories of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist whose name makes up the title. Unfortunately, the metaphor harldy works and serves only as a vain attempt to add meaning to an otherwise mundane, if mildly compelling, mystery that would work better as a screenplay than a piece of literature."
1,Schrodinger's Turning In His Grave,It should be against the law to use someone's name in the title in an effort to sell a book. This trash has nothing to do with Schrodinger. It is a very poor effort at writing an unbelievable story with uninteresting characters. PLease don't waist you time and money on this as I did.
5,Great CD - Classic Louis Hay,I found this meditation to be really helpful. I also like the Releasing Resentment meditation from Epic Meditations. It walks you through letting go of old anger and resentment.
1,horrible!,"This was a horrible visualization for me. Not only did it state that getting physical was an ok way to express anger (I'm assuming she meant just in the visualization), but you actually destroy the people you are angry at. Maybe that's one form of releasing anger, but it isn't for me at all! I guess I'm just not angry enough at anyone to want to blow them away. Strange juxtaposition between the peaceful, safe room you are visualizing and the energy that you focus on basically putting that person out of existence. Extremely negative for me."
2,Not for me.,"I have never felt that I could participate well in guided visualizations. That is exactly what this CD is. If you visualize well and can imgaine well and summon raw emotions at someone else's mere suggestion, this may work well for you. But it doesn't for me. It just feels silly and like a waste of my time and money. This is not my modality."
2,Make sure you are angry at five or more people.,"I didn't expect this kind of a result, but throughout the tape, I couldn't visualize a single person I was angry at. And she says you can release anger at not only one but FIVE people!What am I supposed to do?I just kept seeing an empty room with crystals and that was actually nice. I suppose it is good to know that I am not angry at anyone at the moment.I'm giving two stars for good relaxing music and very nice voice of Louise L. Hay.Theoretically, I understand that it works for people who are consciously or subconsciously angry, but it didn't do wonders to me."
3,not her best,Louise is a great author and has many valuable publications. This one just didn't resonate for me but is still good info.
5,Less anger now,I did not fully know how the anger I carried was affecting me until I listened to this CD and did the exercise. It was very enlightening.
2,I wanted to like this - I love Louise!,"This is a guided meditation. I have given it several listenings and it just hasn't been very effective for me. The biggest problem I have is that you are asked to come up with 5 people you are angry at. I can come up w/maybe one or two but five! and that takes up a huge part of the mediatation, visualizing each person.I am very good at guided visualizations and I do them regularly with great success. This was just too complicated and I abandoned it.I feel bad about giving this cd only 2 stars. I absolutely love Louise Hay and everything she's created."
3,"Fruit flavored blue and yellow, pink is yummier!","Pretty good, but I actually prefer ""Fluffy Stuff"" as the best packaged cotton candy I've tried. That tastes better, and has a better and finer texture. The description containing the information that the various colors are fruit flavored is somewhat buried and I unfortunately missed it when I purchased this. Pink is the nondescript, just-sweet flavor I like. I don't detect any fruity flavor, just maybe slight vanilla. The blue (berry) however tastes like cough syrup and the yellow (pina colada supposedly) is pretty gross to me. I've had a few bags that were all pink and those are pretty good. I honestly do not enjoy the mixed ones nearly as much and neither do the kids. Also, there are large, sharp fragments of sugar that irritate the tongue/mouth as does the coarseness of the candy. There are occasional hard chunks that look like moisture got in."
5,Loved it!,We ordered a bulk for our staff training day (carnival theme). Everyone loved it! It was especially more affordable than renting a cotton candy machine. The bag is colorful and the serving size is great. Would definitely purchase again in the future.
3,Nature Cotton Candy 2.1 ounce,The taste is pretty good. It's not uncommon however to find much ofthe bags single color (mostly blue). Have never had one that contained the coloryellow.
4,Good product,"The cotton candy was nice. I prefer fresh over this kind that is packaged, but it was still good. It didn't taste stale at all and it had a lot in the package. I would buy it again."
5,My daughter loves these,"In addition to being a quality pasta, these tiny letters are fun to play with on their own. They take about 10 minutes of boiling to cook, which surprised me, because they are so tiny. However, they have to absorb a lot of water because they just about double in every dimension when cooked. The pasta tastes good, and appears to be well-made and carefully packaged.I don't like to give my 3-year-old canned alphabet soup, since it contains a ton of sodium, MSG, and soggy vegetables, and it turns out she prefers these. To make a quick snack for her, I use:1 cup organic chicken broth (low sodium)1/4 cup alphabet pastapinch of saltCombine in a small saucepan and heat on medium for 12-13 minutes, starting with cold broth. You can add more broth, throw in some cooked chicken, veggies, herbs, or whatever your child likes."
3,Okay for a beginner,"This is a nice simple starting point. Not a whole lot challenging in it, but a lot of information. My biggest complaint is the fact that there are several places where the authors give some different viewpoints on an issue (which in itself is often fine), but they do it over a few things that are theologically important, IMO."
2,Not useful for everyone,"If you completely believe that everything in the Christian Bible/New Testament is true, then this book will be helpful. If you do not necessarily automatically accept everything in the NT, this book will be worthless to you, because it is based almost entirely on circular reasoning...meaning that some Christian concept is presented as true because another part of the Christian Bible says so...BUT I'm sure this is a wonderfully helpful book for Christians."
3,Buy something else,Saw this kitchen on TV and said - oh how cool! Got it home - how cheap. It is not durable and you have to keep adding ice to the oven in order to make the food change colors. Took it back to the store the very next day. Don't waste your money!
1,Glad to hear about other peoples experience with this toy,"I am so glad I took the time to read the reviews from other consumers about this kitchen. I saw the commercial for this and said ""I have to buy this for my daugther"".Money is real tight this christmas and this is an expensive item but my daugther has to have it.I added this item to my cart but before I proceeded with the order, I decided to read the reviews. I'm glad I did because it doesnt sound like it is worth the money. Those consumers should also contact the manufacturer as well and let them know that they are charging way too much money for a toy that doesnt sound like it lasts for more than a week."
1,not really magic,"this toy was hyped up to be the best toy for little girls for christmas, well i bought my daughter one of these sweet magic kitchen's she was 4 soon to be 5 and she was really disappointed she wanted the kitchen to work like it did on t.v. but it didn't and after a few days of being frustrated she stop playing with it."
5,OOO!WOW!HOW!AMAZING!,This kitchen far exceeds any other. The constant elements of surprise and incredible color change gave my niece such a sense of accomplishment she has decided to be a chef. We can only hope her future cooking experiences are as fulfilling. I truly thank Fisher Price for creating another wonderful product.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT WAS THE ONLY THING MY 4 YEAR OLD WANTED FROM SANTA. WE OPEN THE BOX TO FIND THAT IT WON'T WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE FREEZER EACH TIME, THEN WE FIND OUT THAT THE ""PASTRIES"" WERE NOT MADE CORRECTLY SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYWAY. THAT WE WOULD NEED TO SEND IN FOR THE ONES THAT WILL WORK, BUT, WE WOULD GET A FREE GIFT ALSO. AS IF THAT SHOULD MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE 4 YEAR OLD WHO'S HEART IS BROKEN BECAUSE HER SWEET MAGIC KITCHEN DOESN'T WORK. THE PRODUCTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED OR THE ""WORKING PASTIRES"" SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE RETAILERS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS CHEAPLY MADE, I AM SURPRISED THE OVER DOOR HASN'T FALLEN OFF YET. THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR DOESN'T CLOSE COMPLETELY AND THE HINGE ON IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. VERY OVER PRICED. WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2,not durable at all....nice idea but not a great product,this thing was such a pain to put together...not sure if we had an older version of it or not...but i did notice manufacture date of 2002 on it but it was bought in 2004my boys were so excited to get this...but after the huge hassle of putting it together...one day of playing with it..they took off the oven door...and the fridge door...pieces did not work well with the cooling part of it...we ended up replacing this toy with a different kitchen...not a good toy for multiple children to play with...not durable enough to stand up..maybe good for one child to play....but for the money i would look elsewhere
2,Not what I thought it would be,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas...and the thing has fallen apart. The oven door won't stay up. The fridge door came off. Just not what I thought it would be. I bought this when it 1st came out...and it was a waste of money. If I could get my money back I would!
2,This is a poor design...don't waste your $,"I really wish I would have read these reviews prior to buying this kitchen. As many people noted, the oven door does not stay shut. The plastic that this toys is made out of is cheap. I called Fisher Price to complain, and they recommended using velcro to keep the door shut. Not a satisfactory solution. Very dissapointing."
1,Not worth The money,My child has had it for 2 years and has yet to play with it. The pretend food is cool wished there would have been more food peice. The door allways falls off not sure why.
3,Sweet Magic Kitchen,"My daughter was almost 3 when we bought the kitchen. She loves to play with it; however we have had problems with the oven door staying shut. We called Fisher-Price to have them replace it and they were very good about sending us another door to replace the other one; however, the new one wasn't any better at staying shut than the first, so we didn't even bother taking it apart. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem. Maybe it was just an unfortunate experience. My daughter and her friends do enjoy the oven. They love playing with the cookies and cakes that change color. They think that is pretty neat."
3,Not to happy!,"If I had it to do over again, I would not suggest this kitchen. The oven door does not stay closed and my daughter gets so mad trying to shut it over and over again. Even though all the items that come with this kitchen are cute, its not worth the hassle of making the food change colors. Think twice before you purchase this one!!"
2,not as great as we thought!!,"My little got this toy last year for xmas. She was so happy to have but as we put it together all the stuff was not there, also it was missing parts that make it work. I took it back and got a new one. This time just some of the things where there, that was upsetting to my little girl but we kept it any way. Well the doors do not stay closed and the top part of it's coloing has fade. I will be buying her a new kitchen this year for xmas but not the same one!"
4,"she loves it, but...","What a cheaply made product...for the money, its ridiculous. However, my 4 yr old girl does love playing with it. Be prepared for very flimsy construction, and not-so-easy assembly. A wooden-style kitchen would be better for the money."
2,poor quality,"This kitchen may offer a great concept, but it doesn't live up to the Fisher Price name. Yes, the food is precious and quite durable, but the inner workings are a different story. We bought this for our daughter this Christmas and once the kitchen was assembled, we realized that it was broken. It didn't play music nor did the fan work which would blow onto the food to change the color. So, we now have a kitchen that does nothing special. We could have bought another name brand for cheaper if we would have known this. We're totally disappointed in the customer service of Fisher Price as well. When we called to voice our complaint, they offered to send the replacement parts, but they won't be in until two months from now. So now our daughter cannot fully enjoy her new kitchen. She doesn't even know what it is supposed to do. What a total disappointment!! Who feels like taking a new product apart again to box it up, take it back to the store, exchange it, and then reassemble it?"
1,"Don't waste your money! Poorly made, cheap product!","We bought this item and promptly returned it! Please don't waste your money on this product! It's cheaply made and breaks easily. It cracked while setting it up. When we brought it back to the store, the sales clerk stated that people were returning them left and right because of the same problem. We returned it for a Little Tikes kitchen set. I wasn't suprised when we were told that was the last Little Tikes kitchen they had in stock. Go with Little Tikes consumers! Fisher Price ought to be ashamed for putting their name on such a poorly made product!"
1,Broken from the start.,"I have had a bad experience with this kitchen, the plastic seemed very brittle when we first opened the box, as we began to assemble cracks started to emerge. By the time my daughter saw i the oven door was almost completely off. Sureeough it began to fall apart. The sound doesn't always work, even though the batteries are new, the product seems to be a very low end production from FP,seems a lot of corners were cut. I know bottom line figures have to be met by everyone including toy makers, but if you are going make a cheap product price accordingly. I tried returning but could not because I threw out box, if you purchase this , save your box you will most likely need it."
5,VERY SWEET LITTLE KITCHEN,"... I felt that I had to write.......POSITIVLY! We bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter's Birthday. It has been the center of all play since she got it! The plastic that it is made of seems about the same type as other kitchens, maybe a little thinner. The cookies and cakes are amazing for the little ones to ""bake"". It is a blast! I even enjoy playng with her! I haven't had any problems with it at all!! Great entertaining toy!! A fun filled kitchen for all ages!"
3,Good Luck!!,"My daughter has been asking for this gift for over a month for Christmas. My husband had been to 9 different stores and they all were out. By far a popular toy. Wanting to keep the Christmas spirit alive we are willing to go to any point to keep our daughter happy on christmas morning. After all she prays every night for Santa to bring it to her. Well after finding this ""SWEET MAGIC KITCHEN"" more than 55 miles away from home we go pick it up. Its all put together now but I think its durability is awful. It's very cheaply made not worth the money at all. The oven door wont stay shut, the handle is broken, and the door to the fridgerator will not stay on, not closed but on, It is constantly falling of the hindges and all this before my 2 daughters have had there turn at it. If this is a kitchen you are looking to buy I strongly suggest you think again. I wish we did. If this was not a gift my daughter asked for from Santa this ""kitchen"" would not be in my house right now. Good luck!!"
3,This is not a book for those who do not know what TS is about,"Imagine you are TS. You want to give someone something to learn about TS. This is not the book.Most of it talks about her wild lifestyle.Many parts saying this in summary -""I moved to (whatever) town and became a (call girl).""This book is also full of self pity.It is fun to read, but don't expect to learn much about coming out to family or friends.The photos? a few are good, but most of them are pretty poor quality. Perhaps they were taken with a very bad camera.I would say buy this book for a fun read, but don't expect to learn anything."
3,ok for small dog,This run is ok for a small dog. We have a Husky that is under 50 pounds but he has it kinked and almost broken in 3 days. The cable is pretty thin. For a dog that isn't as strong - it would work just fine.
4,Great presentation of XML basics,"This book is very useful and well written. The topics covered include XML basics, DTD's, style sheets, XML schemas, XML Query, XHTML, SYMM and MIL. It describes each topic in detail and with examples. Some of the examples help understand the different error messages given by the validating parsers. Perhaps that is the part programmers are mostly interested in.Topics like XML Query and RDF are out of date as of now (Sept 2002), due to new W3C specifications, but introduction provided in the book is still useful for getting started. I really like XML Query chapter because no other small introduction is available elsewhere as of now.This book is an excellent choice to get started with XML. It has got all the basics and nice examples."
2,A Complete Reference It's Not,"Ms. Williamson has written a good text that covers the basics, but I'd hardly call it a complete reference. But what bothers me the most is that I can ALMOST NEVER find what I need in the index! And I've read the book. I end up spending way too much time thumbing through the pages to find something I know I've read. For example, where is that part on the <xsl:output> attributes? It's on page 358, but you'll never discover that from the index--unless you look under ""result trees, XSLT."" Give me a break."
5,a truly massive undertaking,"These two volumes are an expanded and revised edition of Margaret Griffel's pioneering 1999 work. These two hardcover volumes take 985 pages. The first volume (558 pages) lists the operas in alphabetical order. Each entry contains a description of the opera, composer, first performance, bibliography, and source of libretto. In many cases a synopsis is also included. The second volume is a compilation of lists of composers with their dates, works, year of premiere, and location of premiere. A similar list is included of librettists followed by a chronology and list of characters.This reference belongs in every music library whether of an institution or collectors.Well done!"
1,"Good product, If you can get it to work.","I was running the NAVMAN GPS on a iPAQ 3955. To make this short, after doing a ""Hard"" reset and applying the latest Soft-Paq I could get it to work 1 out of 10 times.Another mistake I made was buying a SanDisk 512mb CF card so I could store the program and maps (You'll get about 1/4 of the US on the card.) You can't install the program to the CF card as it will not function and the program (4.3mb installed) definitely slowed down my machine.Just so you know I sent it back to Amazon and was refunded."
3,Stretchy Bracelet,"Purchased the bracelet because it's my 1st grandchilds birthstone. I really like the look, however when it stretches out some of the stones get loose so I'm afraid to wear it much. Sorry to say that because I really like the look of the bracelet. I'm on the fence on whether to recommend it. I actually bought 2 of them - but haven't worn either much - just don't want to lose the stones."
3,stretchy peridot bracelet,when you put it on the stones start falling out - it's beautiful - just hope I don't lose all the stones!
2,So so book,"Honestly, I thought this book will be a good one to have in my kitchen. It turned out that the information in the book can be found anywhere on the internet. I hated that most of the recipes called for unfamiliar ingredients. I ended up donating this book to my local public library. I know someone will find it useful."
3,good introductory video to knightlihood,"This video adaquately explains: how armor developed; how castles developed; how knights developed. It is punctuated throughout with bios of some of the more famous of knights. It is not really all that in depth but if detail is what one wants then one should read a book. All in all it is at least a good viewing to be introduced to knights. This video peeks at how armor is made. Lastly, there are some minutes devoted to how one may get their own bona fide coat-of-arms. As I've tried to imply, it's worth watching."
5,Works with my older Kohler 2 piece toilet.,"I was concerned that this wouldn't work because everything says its for a 1 piece toilet, but it works fine with my 2 piece Kohler too. Seems to flush with more force at the end too."
2,Universal Arcade controller,This Product was fun while it lasted. With in a few game session of SF 3rd strike the joystick managed to break off and I had to use super glue to get back into the game. I also bought this mainly for my Xbox console but it just didn't want to work with my Xbox. No issues while using it with my PS2 though. Response is great with this product in comparison to my gamester arcade stick. all the points in the joystick respond with no issues...don't have to be 100% on point. all in all it was a great product while it lasted and I hope the improve on the build quality of there products
4,The Asheville Alphabet Book,"This book walks young readers on an alphabetical tour of Asheville, NC. From ""A"" for Asheville to ""Z"" for zig-zagging trails, The Asheville Alphabet Book holds a fun and entertaining way to learn the 26 letters. By associating the letters with different places and animals from the area, young children can begin to understand our letter system and older readers can learn about the city through extremely detailed captions for each letter, including some of the history for Asheville's beloved landmark, The Biltmore Estate. Each letter has its own full-page illustration to assist toddlers's letter associations. The illustrations are mainly watercolor, adding beauty to some pictures, while giving some a somewhat undefined look to others. This book contains everything for young kids to gain a handhold on our changing society by learning the very basis of it while at the same time being entertained by this deligthtful book."
1,Deceptive Seller,"The book I received is not the same one shown in the picture on the listing, nor is the ISBN number the same. They sent me the instructor's manual instead of the real book. Nowhere on the listing did it say anything to indicate that it was not the book shown. In a nut shell, I got screwed."
5,I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT IS A WONDERFUL BOOK.,"A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS A PROFESSOR IN ZIMBABWE (UNIVERSITY OF ZIMBABWE) WOULD LIKR TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A TEACHERS RESOURCE BOOK, OR ANY SUPPLEMENTS TO THIS BOOK (SELLING - BUILDING PATNERSHIP)"
1,My boss threw it out the window,"I am a recent college graduate who now works full time for a startup consultant. I had to write a small business plan and since it was my first time my boss suggested I buy some books. I bought a few. My boss has written many business plans so he knows what to look for. Long story short, he threw it out the window. This book could have made me dumber."
5,VERY INTERESTING!,"In my opinion, ""Ju-On White Ghost/Black Ghost"" was much better than ""Ju-On 2"" It was interesting to see how the stories tied together, much more cohesive than the aforementioned movie. Definitely worth the money!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this thinking it was a continuation of the Kayako/Toshio story but it turned out to be two different movies on one disk....one called White Ghost, the other called Black Ghost. The story line described on the back of the case looked very interesting but each film had about 3 different plots going on, none of which related to one another, and the ""ghosts"" weren't Kayako and Toshio at all but two new ones that didn't even hold a candle to the original ghosts. The entire film was a joke; not even scary."
1,How do you spell PHOTOCOPY?,"I never create reviews but this was such a rip off I had to.- To start out it's not even a book! It's photocopied pages stapled together.- The ""seals"" are Photo Copied right out of the book ""Secrets of magical seals by Anna Riva ISBN 0-9438-3204-7"" (and her book was only $5.) Parchment on line from an occult supplier is about $5, all you need it access to a copy machine and your good to go and you could make your own ""seals"" just as well as you could buy them here.The rest of the info in the book I've found on various on line occult sites (the way it is put together looks like they did the same thing!) So my review is:-Do not waste your money on this!My guess is that because the information is over 2k years old it's copyright free right? If so then you could also photocopy most things in this book, use artistic license to change things around a bit and sell your own photocopied ""book"" for $40."
2,read reviews before you buy,"I wish had read the reviews prior to my purchase now. I received this item today and when I opened the box it was nothing more than a few pages of photocopied paper with a single staple in the top left corner holding it together. The seals on the parchment are ok i guess, but a few of the seals are not printed squarely on the page and a portion of the seals are cut off making some incomplete. Also the quality of the print is not good on most of the seals.. some of the markings and writing are very unclear.Save yourself some money and do not purchase this, unless you have the money to waste and just want some very basic eye candy for your magickal library. It is not even ""paperback"" as stated, plan to get a hole punch and a binder."
4,Golden Age of Science Fiction,This a nice collection of short stories.Groff Conklin is a terrific anthologist. Too bad they do not make'emm like that anymore. And I mean both the anthologist and the stories!
4,A Brilliant Theater Performance,"This is not a movie version of Herman Melville's MOBY DICK; it is a single actor on a stage, in front of an audience, playing all roles. You might think this wouldn't be enjoyable, but for a mature viewer seeking to squeeze the essence out of the book, this is quite worth while. The actor is brilliant, shifting characters in a blink. One deeply experiences the personalities of the main characters, especially Ahab; you can feel the mad rage pouring forth from Ahab."
3,"Artistic Masterpiece, Problematic Frame",Jack Aranson turns in a brilliant performance in this taped version of a well staged one-man-show. His artistic sensibilities are inspired. The way he segues from character to character in Melville's masterpiece demonstrates a flexibility of talent rarely found on screen or stage. Having said that it is important for the consumer to know that the production of the DVD is somewhat problematic. There is no menu for scene selections. Once the performance commences the only way to switch scenes is to skip from chapter to chapter manually. The viewer will then discover that although 33 chapters of material are listed there are actually only 25. Oddly enough chapter 25 has only one sentence of content. For some strange reason this disc plays on most computers and DVD players but not all of them. I have never encountered a more frustrating combination of post-production idiosyncrasies on any DVD I have ever purchased.
4,Future Acting Cult Classic !!,Captain Ahab as done by Jack Aranson may be the finest Ahab ever put to film. Jack captures Herman Melville's blank verse. This is a DVD you will watch over and over for the insights contained in MOBY DICK.This is not a sea story- this is the classic story of where pride and arrogance will lead you.The tail is biblical in scope.This is a DVD for the family collection. This is a chance to see some great acting!!
2,Not what I expected,"It wasn't what I thought it was so I was dissapointed. I thought it was a newer version of the movie, but it was a one man show. I didn't care for it."
2,fan,Not nearly a good as the equivalent Vornado. We had one of these Honeywell fans for years and it was great. The new one is not nearly the same quality. Poorly made and noisy. We returned this product and bought a Vornado.
4,"Strong, Not Too Loud","It's a good and powerful fan and it's not as loud as I feared from other reviews. I got this one over the lower noise model because it is supposed to push more air. It does pretty good at that and is less noisy than I feared, so I give it good marks. I'd buy another if needed."
3,"Not very quiet, but moves air--maybe too much for a personal fan","I was hoping to use the fan on my desk in an office, but the low setting is pretty noisy, and the airflow on low is more than you need. If you don't mind noise and want a high airflow, it's a good deal."
3,Cannot be cleaned!,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this fan is horrible to clean. The only thing that has helped a little is using Q-tips, but even they can't get in all the way. If you want to get this fan, I recommend getting the black model - at least you won't see the dirt..."
4,A really Useful possession,"Honeywell HT800 Super Turbo High Performance Fan, BlackI bought this just by reading the earlier reviews..A few said it is noisy which it is a little bit. But if you want to beat the summer heat and save on the air-conditioner, this is the one to buy. It has three levels to select and the price that it is offered at, it's the best bet...go ahead and buy it and say ""No"" to the heat...."
1,"It's inexpensive, don't expect much","This fan sounded neat because some previous reviews talked about how powerful it is. Reality is this a small fan, with a very small motor. It does OK for it's size, but does not move what I would consider all that much air even on high. Is it noisy, yeah a little, not unexpected given it's price range.The owners manual gives diagrams for air circulation for whole rooms, up and down stairs, etc. That idea is extraordinarily optimistic considering the lack of power for this fan.This fan should really be considered a cubicle fan, better then the clip on fans costing one half as much, but certainly far short of the oscillating table fans you can get for just a few dollars more. Unless you like overrated mediocrity, there are better choices.Which brings me back to the fan description itself, ""Super Turbo High Performance"" is either hilarious or a sick joke. You can decide."
3,Overall OK,"This fan is just okay. It is small and needs to be put up on a desk or table. On the floor it won't reach a bed or couch since the tilt will only go up so far. Also, it is very loud (louder than other fans I've owned). My biggest complaint is that it cannot be opened to be cleaned. The blades get very dusty and the front does not pop off to give access for cleaning..kind of disappointing."
3,So So,"I got this fan to use in my bathroom which gets quite steamy. It does the job well, but what I don't like is the switch location. It's in back of the top of the circular part of the fan so it's awkward to get at. Whoever designed the location of the switch must have been totally not thinking. But, it does work, and it cools the room and helps with the steaming up. I just can't understand why the switch is in such an illogical spot. I do not recommend this fan because of that."
2,Not as good as Vornado,"This fan shares a similar vortex design as Vornado. However I compared them side by side and it was immediately apparent the Honeywell unit does not measure up.The Vornado really shoots out a column of air, this Honeywell unit doesn't seem to push air anywhere."
5,Super Turbo Fan,"Fan is of good quality, serves purpose for which it was purchased. Feel that the shipping and handling was excessive, charges for S&H were 16.00 actual shipping was less than $5.00. Since the cost of the item is the same at the store I still do not understand why the S&H have to be 3 times. Of course I do understand that Amazon must put there charges in the Handling area."
3,"Nice Fan, a great price",this fan moves a lot of air. it is too noisy and ill probably take it back because of that. It has 3 speeds and i wish there were 2 more lower speeds. 2 of the rubber feet were missing and unfortunately it left scratches\dents in my wood floor.-my dream fan would Not be made in China-my dream fan would be really quietanybody have a better fan for me?
3,Powerful . . . Maybe Too Powerful,This is great value for the price. But even the lowest setting is a little too strong. And its fairly loud compared to your average table fan.
3,Yes and No,"Nice strong breeze. Good enough to ventilate one room (150 square feet) while painting. Too loud and powerful, even at the lowest setting, to be used as an office desk fan. Same goes for black. Missed stars for the accessibility of controls and also for noise/vibrations."
3,not as advertised,I bought this fan for a remodeled bathroom (all white) but the fan was notwhite as stated. This fan is also very noisy and could not be used in masterbath. BUT it really moves the air so it did its job just fine in the garage.
3,"Good design, won't last forever","I bought the case for my work phone; I work in an industrial environment and the case sees alot of serious use. It's a solid case, works good for protecting the phone from abrasion. Its been nearly three months now and the case is beginning to come apart. I don't really blame the quality of the case as its seen much abuse. I'll likely get another when this one is finally unusable."
1,It reads like substandard Heinlein,The concept of surreal numbers is irritating enough without them being cutesified by a sycoophant.
2,One Blink of the Eye,"I purchased this video because I am a collector of anything dealing with the supremes, however, I was very disappointed with this addition. I would suggest you wait till the price is $5.00 to purchase this DVD. I was truly excited when it came in the mail. I rushed home, put it in the player and before a blink of the eye, it was over!! The actual interview with Mary is like only 15 long, if 15 minutes. There are only two short inserts of Diana and the supremes performing. So short unless you pay real good attention to detail, you would be unable to remember much about the performance. I thought when I purchased this DVD there would have been some segments of the group together doing a couple of entire songs, and a true interview at least 45 minutes long or 60 minutes. I must say I am truly disappointed for the money I invested in the DVD. The only thing positive about it was that Mary was very candid, very real and honest with her remarks."
1,Profiles featuring Mary WIlson DVD,Dont bother with this if you already know who Mary is. There is nothing new other than standard questions and answers.
4,I have to disagree with a Reader from England...,"I'm currently enrolled in a doctoral program in Information Science and, while this book isn't the sum total of all LIS knowledge, I've found it invaluable as a reference on Information Seeking. Few other places will you find this level of literature review laid out in such a compact way. I use it nearly every day in my studies and I'm grateful that Don Case wrote it. It's a roadmap and guidebook for my studies.- A reader from Texas"
3,Dense,"I bought this because it was a required book for a college course. It is very dense, in small print, and hard cover. The material is interesting and it is supposed to be a survey of all the research done on this subject, which it does very well. It mentions and explores not only the major studies but also many lessor known ones. This book is good for a class or research but this is not a book you would just read for fun."
4,Good Book,I am using it in a graduate course I am taking and have found it to be very easy to read. It does a good job of describing the various theories concerning information seeking behavior and provides decent examples.
2,The case of a failed survey mission....,"I was excited by the possibility of a suitable overview of information seeking, I obtained the book a.s.a.p. I was willing to forgive the high price in favour of a good text.It was downhill from there: Unfortunately the text of Donald Case's book fails to impress on any level.For the scope of the subject matter the book is surprising in the selection of items included and omitted. With some areas appearing rather bald in references and general coverage.By giving focus to a selection of models that embrace need and sources, and in different aspects e.g. information overload, the portrait is skewed.To use this book in teaching it would require much more support from supplementary texts and journal articles to correct the omissions.I cannot recommend this text to students nor to academics seeking a suitable class text."
1,Superficial,"Written primarily for entry-level job applicants, and relying on a firm's own promotional literature, VaultReports.com Employer Profiles won't tell you anything that you can't determine from a firm's website.Interested in how the big accounting firms really operate? Buy ""Final Accounting"" by Barbara Ley Toffler. It's about the demise of Arthur Andersen, but applies to the Final Four just as well."
3,Theater of the Absurd,"This book is a wacky little collection of women's dreams of Madonna and some very odd collages featuring photos of Madonna mish-moshed together with drawings, artwork, etc... The text wasn't all that interesting(ya just gotta wonder- are there really THAT many people out there dreaming of Madonna every night? ). It was really the collages, with their little oddities and quirkiness that made me look at the book more than once. If you are a die-hard Madonna fan and absolutely HAVE to have every item ever made about Madonna, then you should get this book--if only to say that you own it in your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't reccommend it to the average book consumer."
1,Disappointed,"I found this book to be too exaggerated, subs 12 miles wide carrying 2 million soldiers. Soldiers raping and killing every single captive. A good idea spoilt by hype."
4,Nicely Done Nonetheless,"If you're looking for nicely done versions of these songs, this may be the set for you."
1,Bait and switch,"Once again, we have here an album of ""covers""--not the original hits by the original artists. Be forewarned."
5,Documentary too BE Watched by All,something new in our world has come to light.this documentary is unusual but most intriging.it leaves you something to think about.i enjoyed watching this.
4,Easy to clean,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas as he has a big bird bath that he has to clean out often and it freezes so he has an electric water heater in it. All of this is kind of a pain when it's freezing out. We like this solar sipper a lot and it never gets bird turds in it but it freezes more easily than we thought it would. The box says you need to bring it inside at night if its below freezing and I don't remember seeing that in the amazon description. Otherwise i would have given it 5 stars. We don't take it in, we just pour hot water on it in the morning or turn it upside down and pop out the giant hockey puck of ice. That's actually turned out to be a bonus. The kids love playing with the big frozen disc, pushing it with brooms in the driveway."
4,Solid review of Russian negotiating behaviour,"Schecter has given us a considered and reliable glimpse into what drives Russian diplomats and decision-makers in negotiations. Useful references to Soviet practices give the reader a long-term framework within which to evaluate the more chaotic post-Soviet decision-making processes. Effective countervailing strategies emerge from his analysis. As a practicing Western diplomat dealing with Russia, I will be recommending this book to colleagues."
1,What happened to paramount?!!,"This is deplorable and now suddenly after a month or so of advertising the release of season five, it suddenly disapears and this trash is put in it's place...how long are we going to put up with the stupidity in the DVD market...We are willing to pay good money for good product...I thought it was too good to be true...A very disapointed buyer come on Amazon...start taking an interest in what is going on, or at least explain it to us...we deserve that at least! Phillip King.. Minneapolis."
4,H0T D1SCO-TeCHn0 b3ATS!,i thought this album went good with the movie. The whole rave disc0 b3ats g0t me off my seat 2 dance.
3,We need more,"This CD is good but a lot of songs from the movie were left out. I read rumors of a second CD but that seems to have faded away...too bad. As another reviewer pointed out, an awesome track called Bluebottle by POB (which I found on the CD ""Platipus Beginner's Guide"") is missing. I didn't know the track's name before buying this disc and was disappointed that it wasn't here. I thought it was the best track in the movie. Overall, still a CD worth owning."
3,Grove Soundtrack,Love the movie so i bought the soundtrack. Nothng too crazy on this cd but the beats are pretty chill. Good little mix.
4,Good mixes...,"Judging from the little samples I've heard so far, the soundtrack is well put-together. The CD compilers picked some great tracks for the soundtrack!! Can't wait to see the movie! (if it should ever come near Alabama!)"
1,I loved the movie and I loved the CD,So you may ask why i only gave the cd 1 star? because it is a soundtrack and it left out the number one best song of the movie. right before heavenscent plays(in the movie) the best song of the entire movie plays. It's not on the cd and i dont know what it is called........this has plagued me since i bought the sound track
2,Had high hopes...,"This boot looked like it was going to be comfortable and in between a dress boot and casual, just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it was clunky looking on, material scrunched down and irritated around my ankles and hugged my calves. I also almost stabbed my foot first trying to put on because there was a metal staple sticking up inside bottom of boot! It was so deep inside I couldn't pull it out so said enough of that. I managed to get the other one on after some effort and just wasn't worth the hassle. Returned these and kept my Apepazza boots which were lovely."
5,Emotionally drenched,"It's raw and real, the lyrics don't hide anything and Holly McNarland is one of the best songwriters I've ever had the chance to hear and see live. Those vocals of her stretched to every side of the stadium and left an impression that will last for a long while."
5,Soulful music minus the whining,"I heard of Holly because of the song Numb on the Big Shiny Tunes CD, and after weeks of having that stuck in my head I went out and bought both of her CD's. I definitely prefer Stuff, and the song Porno Mouth grabs me everytime I hear it. My husband loves female artists but I can't handle the whining that's so prevalent today, which makes Holly the perfect compromise. Deep, soulful lyrics and striking, wrenching music that keeps me listening over and over."
5,Yes! Get definitely a get!,"Holly Mcnarland has become my fave female artist. And it's justified! The lyrics & music are very real, very creative and powerful! In concert she's really cool too and she's really nice if you talk to her! She's Canadian! Yaay!"
3,not a good self-learning tool,I was surprised at how poorly I did on the test at the end of the first chapter. If a book isn't explaining well enough or thoroughly enough to pass a test something is wrong. The strength of the book is actually the test sections. The answers are step-by-step and this is where I learned.
5,Hot Music!,"The CD is hot. The tracks are very catchy, the music is on the money and dancing to the beats is lots of fun. Myself an my girlfriends dances tracks 2 and 3 all night last weekend.Rick is also very hot!! see the pictures on the insert. Good CD overall. Get this one for sure."
4,Good powered speakers,"Great speaker for hometheater. Nice clean sound, no muffled sound whatsoever. This sub can bring life to any speaker setup. Good lows all the way to 60hz."
5,The Great Ball Game of the Birds and Animals,"What more could you ask from a picture book? The Great Ball Game of the Birds and Animals is a wonderful tale that explains how the bat and the flying squirrel came to be. Duvall's version of this story sticks closely to the original Cherokee legend with expanded imagery and character development. Like all great stories, this one teaches a lesson for human beings. Jacob's beautifully detailed drawings will hold the imagination spellbound as the story unfolds in crisp black and white. This book won the 2003 Oklahoma Book Award for Design and Illustration. I am proud to own a signed first edition that I obtained while visiting Tahlequah, Oklahoma during the Cherokee National Holiday. I highly recommend this book to art collectors and readers alike."
4,rapala,"Hi, in 2010 i caught a foot to a foot 1\2 long large mouth bass. i used a size 3.i like this lure.As rapala says, catch more and bigger fish."
4,my girl loves it!,"We just bought this for our 4 year old girl, and she loves making tea, serving it, adding ""cream"" and ""sugar"", etc. Lots of pieces and parts, and the lack of any heavy ""Barbie"" messages, makes this a fun toy."
3,not as helpful as it seems,"I bought this book prior to my european trip thinking it would help a lot as far as finding the non touristy, weird , and bizarre places. it is helpful to an extent but it ends up just repeating info that more general guides such as Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring and Let's Go Europe have. if you are planning to go for a lengthy period of time do not buy this book for it will only be extra weight. Lonely Planet's Europe has all the info you need. from hostels to bizarre places to go and see. overrall Weird Europe is not a bad guide, it just seems unnecessary if you already have one of the above guides. places are listed in a good order and the book even provides the directions how to get to most of those, such as metro stops, etc. a lot of guides repeat info. one is enough. i learned that one month into the trip when the weight of that backpack really starts digging into your shoulders."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I was very excited to receive this ""like new"" copy of Weird Europe, as I was going to Europe in a month and have always been a fan of the weirder side of culture. However, I was extremely dissapointed to find that large chunks of the book were missing. I was most upset that about 20 pages on Prague were gone, because that's the reason I ordered the book. This should not have been advertised as ""like new"", it should've been classified as ""garbage""..."
1,The Hundred Years War: England and France at War c.1300-c.1450 =,Intended as a gift for an avid history reader. The book's print was miniscule. A magnifying glass would be necessary to read it. Scholastic to the point of boredom.
1,Boring...Boring,"That's it for me! I have been reading the series since its inception and have had enough of the EXTENDED version. This book has been dragged out to earn MONEY, not reach Christians. What a joke! Instead of being stupid and buying the book this time, I borrowed it from my aunt! I put it down after 70 pages...same old stuff and more new characters. When authors' start describing an Apple in detail, they lost the essence. You sold us Out Jenkins & LaHaye."
3,Usual Hard to Put Down Read,"This is the next-to-last volume of the story of the Tribulation Force, a group of holdouts from the ne world government headed up by Nicole Carpathia, a.k.a. the antichrist. Having followed them through the previous twelve books, we find them drawn inevitably to the Middle East, along with all the armies of the world. The ultimate apocalyptic battle of the ages is shaping up. The setting is the last year of the Great Tribulation, i.e. before the end of the world as we know it and the return of Christ for a thousand year reign. Some of the characters we know and like the best are in mortal danger, and the authors are not afraid to kill some of them off as various forces converge on them. No one is safe any longer, not family, friends or great leaders.This is the usual hard to put down work of the past ten volumes. It didn't lose the inertia of the first ten. If you liked the first ten, you won't be disappointed. You'll like this one just as much."
3,p,"This is one of the later books in the Left Behind Series. Similar to all the others. Fortunately is a story in itself, so if you don't get the whole series you can still get a good read."
1,Get it over with already!,"Just finished reading it, and they're finally killing off characters that should have died several books ago. No surprise at this point, since there's only one book left in the series, but sadly, when these characters kick the bucket, instead of sadness or grief, the typical reader's response will be, ""About time already!"""
2,The Thrill is Gone,"I'm a firm believer that the scriptures are actually sets of possibilities based on our choices and our spiritual connection to God and each other. The prophets recorded what they saw and always asked ""Will you change it?""Thus I was reading this series as a very well-written fiction filled with many great truths and possible events. But the good writing ended, the drama fell flat, the preaching became overbearing and shakily supported. So, although I'll regret not knowing how the characters fare in the end, I'm walking away. I'm also walking away because I realized the authors' true view (and the basic plot of the novels) of the Jewish/Israel nation--that either they ""convert"" or die. This is not the wonderful bmessage of my Master Jesus the Christ at all! You'll find if asked, He would that ""we all GO!"" And the Peacemakers are blessed above all."
3,One spoon at a time,"I have been reading this series for years. How did I get trapped in this?Good news! I found a new trilogy, all the books are out at once, and it has an ending. I think this new series by author Cary R. Bybee is going to be the trilogy of the year. It is great, and it is in paper back or hard back.I read the first book expecting some sort of Left Behind clone, but it was incredible, full of scary stuff, romance, supernatural events, and natural science woven into it. Each book got better than the one before. The trilogy is called ""The Last Gentile,"" ""Deacon's Horn,"" and ""The Final Witness."" Thumbs up to Cary Bybee for taking the time to get it right."
3,There are better books,"Armageddon is good, but nothing better. ""Good"" about sums it up. The setting takes place a few years into the future, in which the Battle of Armageddon is approaching, and even begins at the end of the book.Though I disagree with much of the ""doctrine"" in this book (I'm Mormon), I won't make that the point of my review, since I really doubt anybody is reading this book seeking spiritual truth.When I read this book, I hadn't read any of the prequels to it in the series. The book was still relatively easy to follow. Some parts were good, and I found myself growing closer to the rather unbelievable characters. Yes, the characters are unbelievable. Even disciples of Christ have flaws, and it seemed most of the characters in this book did not, save ""the Beast"" and those with ""the Mark"".If you can find a better book, read it instead. If you're that bored and this one is avaliable, go for it."
3,There's a better series out,"Greetings,As a Left behind follower I can attest to the fact that these books are dry. They have really started to milk us fans. But good news, there is an extremely exciting new trilogy out. It is called The Last gentile trilogy. The books are The Last Gentile, Deacon's Horn, and The Final Witness. These books are nonstop action, romance, and suspence. From what I can see the writer obviously did his homework. They are very factual and scary. These books seem to transend every area of life, and the science blended into the book gives the reader a real sense of the terrifying side of the tribulation. I highly recommend Left Behind fans pick these books up. I noticed that they have only been out a month or so and have already begun to climb the ... charts."
2,HOPE THE NEXT BOOK IS BETTER!,"I LOVE THE ""LEFT BEHIND SERIES"", BUT THIS BOOK WAS NOT ONE OF THE BEST. I BOUGHT IT WITH HIGH EXPECTATION, BUT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I CONTINUED TO READ IT BECAUSE I WILL GET THE NEXT BOOK AND WANT TO KEEP UP WITH THE STORYLINE, BUT IT""S A BIT BORING, AND VERY PREDICTABLE. BETTER TO BORROW IT, THAN BUY IT!"
3,It's such an interesting topic,"i have consumed all the books in the series and couldn't wait to get Armageddon. The writing is simplistic, but there is just something about these books that hold my interest, I was hardly unable to put the book down. My only beef is that the ending wasn't satisfying. Will be looking for the next installment."
1,Unadulterated pap,"Only reason I gave it 1 star is you can't give zero. Complete nonsense, contrary to scripture and common sense alike. Strictly for the brain dead."
3,bruce b,"I thought will this series ever end? I want closure, the story is good but I like Cary Bybee's Last Gentile series much better if you haven't read it you should. This book keeps you interested but only 3 stars"
3,NOT BAD NOT GREAT.,"I like the series, but it's starting to drag alittle. I'm sure the ending will be worth the reading. I can't wait. Also, I would like to share another good read for people enjoy a 'good vs evil' storyline with a wonderful message. THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas is a great spiritual warfare novel. I highly recommend it."
2,"No need of a high school education, the writing is that bad","The story is ok, but I would be hard pressed to find another book as poorly written as this series. Very vanilla, maybe that is the target audience with this work of fiction, bunch of nitwits."
1,My god! I think you are all mad.,Trying to relate some nonsense fiction to the fates and realities of real living people is ludicrous. Either all of you guys are at the far left on the bell curve or you are misfortunate enough to have been raised as a fundamentalist.The bible was written by men and the koran was written by men. So please use your heads people and get in touch with reality.
1,Left Behind series: Books 1 through 4,"I was given the 1st book in the series as a free gift in the store 'Books-A-Million'. I read it out of curiousity, having heard so much about being ""left behind"". Still curious, I bought books 2 and 3 and was given book 4. After reading the anti Catholic crap in those books, I decided to throw them away and not make the Authors any richer. I do not believe in ""rapture"" and think it is a very selfish theory. I don't think the author is very Christian to knock other religions. All Christians believe in one God and Jesus Christ. As long as we follow their teachings, we will see heaven. Maybe this world would be better off if we all just except our differences and love one another."
1,The Left Behind Series in NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,"I do not believe that the themes explored in the Left behind series will ever take place. God is loving, He just wouldn't do that what is described in these books. In fact I do not believe that the Lord will come again in person, but he will come again in a new understanding of his Word (the Bible). This new understanding is accessible in the New Church, a New Christianity. Based on the teachings of the Old and New Testaments and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg. To find out more about these amazing teachings of a New Christianity, check out www.newchurch.org"
2,disappointing,"I've been listening to these books on CD at work and I've been waiting for the real action. And so far this is the biggest disappointment. This book is read on 10 CD's. I am almost throught the 8th CD and I still haven't reached the cosmic battle. How can you call the book Armegeddon and spend more then 80% on stupid Chloe and filling up space? And I can tell that they wanted to make sure the book didn't seem sexist or racist. Bubut why do the some of women in the story seem annoying like Chloe and Leah? I've read other books with strong women heroines and they just seem strong and able to take care of theirselves. Not annoying and snappy. The writing is just terrible. Does there have to be a history given for every character introduced into the story? And it's a shame that I've read other reviews that say this is the best, most exciting book in the series. If this represents the best of the series the whole series barely deserves 1 star."
3,No Title Necessary!!!!,"As a Catholic Christian I like the Left Behind Series, and believe in the message these books are trying to get across.BUT, I think that the series has dragged on too long with too many characters to follow, people who appear at on stage, we get involved with them. Then we're left waiting for three books to find out what happened to them. Also, for a world that is in such chaos and destruction, there is too much back and forth with super computers and cell phones, which I understand aren't supposed to be in operation. The early church spread quickly without the aid of these things, and I would like to see modern people survive in an eniviroment without these things we rely on so heavily today.It would be interesting to see if they would hold fast to faith as I hope they would with computers and cell phones.."
2,More Padding Than A Sealy Posturepedic,"From the first book to the latest, it's evident that the authors had one thing in mind: Money. The entire series could have been condensed into three (at the most) books. LOTS of padding. To demonstrate; While reading a chapter, I stopped halfway through and started reading the next chapter. Once I finished it, I went back and completed the previous chapter. The result? I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING RELEVANT TO THE STORY!The story is good, but the writing is horrendous."
2,Why bother when others do it so much better?,"Left Behind is a fairly decent series, but that's all. The writing is pedestrian and the theological concepts almost nonexistent. I could understand why people bought this series when it ws the best there was to offer, but now, with We All Fall Down, The Christ clone books, and Conquest of Paradise, all of which are simply much better books, why bother?"
1,It Never Ends,"This series of books just keeps going on and on with no end in site. The story gets weaker and weaker with each book. When the authors started making money with the series they obviously decided to stretch the series out as long as possible to reap all the money they could. I've seen this happen to other series I've read, and they have taken what was a great start and instead of finishing it they put it on life support and let it turn into a vegetable. Do us all a favor and pull the plug!"
1,This Series Only Worsens,I don't know why I keep reading these books. The first two in the series were actually interesting. The ensuing books in the series have only gotten worse as time wears on.What a HUGE disappointment. My cat could write a better book.The Seven Years of the Tribulation is such an awesome topic! These two clowns have managed to complete adulterate it. Tim Lahaye is such a disappointment.I'd give this book no stars if I could.
4,Okay,The more books in the series seem to water it down somewhat. It's like they lost their focus and were trying to fill pages to get on to the next book.
5,Best book since the first one.,"I flew through the first 250 pages in I think about 3 days. LOVE the Left Behind series, this book has me excited about being a Christian again! This book was very hard for me to put down.Non-Stop action like and good Clancy book, plenty of Biblical references for those that doubt God's love for them. Grateful I don't have to wait a year like other readers for the Glorious Appearing to come out, I picked up the series at the right time.Do I sound like a Bible thumper yet, apologize if I do, but don't mind being called a Jesus Freak either...Odd how this series grew on me, even from the beginning of the series I said to myself ""Great I get to red Christian related stuff -like reading the bible without having to read the Bible."" Enjoying the Word of God w/o having to REALLY read His Words... Now that I'm almost through with the series I almost look forward to reading the Bible..."
5,The End Is Near,"I read this book in a day...it was awesome! I think that Dr LeHaye and Mr Jenkins have done an excellent job relating the ""End of the Ages"" to us. While I may differ with some of the theology, I think it's an excellent account of St. John's Revelation of Jesus Christ. This not only tells the story but makes you really soul search yourself to make sure that you are where you need to be. Thank the Lord, I am!I am anxiously awaiting the final book, ""The Glorious Appearing"" of Jesus Christ."
3,more of the same.,"I like the story, but I'm tried of the time it takes to tell it. I wish the writers would rewrite the story in a thousand page novel. I hope the next book is better.If anyone out there likes a great 'good against evil' story, I have the book for you. THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas. It is incredable and well thought out. I was deeply moved by the character James Rood. I loved it. The story and the images stay with with you long after the read."
2,SO so.,"I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then ""the False Prophet"")People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear."
4,Just a book,"I just had to say to all of the reviewers who are complaining about the way this books portrays Christians. This is just a book, it is not something to base your life upon. (That is what the Bible is for). The characters are not real, they are not telling their real life story. It's a book. And let me say that there are a lot of people out there that read these books so they can be informed in ""laymens"" terms what could happen.Also, nobody (Christians included) is perfect. We make mistakes. The only thing we can do is pray that we are forgiven for what we have done."
2,"FICTION, pure and simple","It disturbs me that many people seem to take these books literally, which is why I gave it only 2 stars . . . a good, thrilling, FICTIONAL representation of revelation, yet it is in FACT, fiction, people. Please stop saying things like the books make you feel happy you're ""SAVED"". People who ""BELIEVE"" in these book also probably believe WMD's will be found . . ."
5,Armageddon - An ending or a New Beginning?,The battle for our planet and our souls continues in imitable style - we lose some dear friends and others' fates are left in question - the action continues to mesmerize!
2,Let's Move It Along Shall We?,"I have read every book in the series, so far, but my patience is wearing thin. Tyndale et al. are milking their cash cow for all its worth.From book six on the authors have been dragging their heels, by either having the characters become moody and self-absorbed for pages on end. Or they start ridiculous cliff-hangers with characters refusing to answer their cell-phones and other rot.I have read this series for two reasons. One is see pre-millenialism fleshed out. Two is to see some interesting characters say and do some provocative things that might challenge my thinking.But its starting to get pretty clunky.Advance the plot!"
3,"Good storyline, poor writing","I believe the rapture, tribulation, etc. will happen, so it was interesting to read this series. However, I didn't really care for most of the characters; they were arrogant and just plain not likeable. I did read the entire series because I am interested in the end times, but it was poorly written. Many times I wasn't sure what the author was trying to say; I had to read the sentence a few times and still was unsure. I've read some other posted reviews here and am going to try The Last Gentile soon; am reading Quo Vadis now."
2,"Oh dear, please save us....","This series started out very well. I remember reading that the Left Behind books were going to be limited to seven. Well, I guess the authors found a lot of money. The story lines are getting old and the books are getting more painful to read.Overall, the book is ""okay."" It's just getting old. Now I'm hearing that book 12 is the last one. Please, please, please let it be the last one."
3,a little slow,"Every book in the series I can't seem to put down, but this one, along with the past few, is running a little slow. Only one major thing is happening in this book.....things are dragging!! They only have a year left until the end, there's got to be more that could be happening?!?"
3,"Becoming a bit drawn out, but still good","I have to agree with several reviewers here who have pointed out that this story is begining to feel a bit padded. A good story needs to make the reader feel as though they are being pulled along with it, and this is rapidly causing me to loose that sensation. Still, I find myself enjoying the story and curious about what will happen next, so the authors are obviously succeeding on some levels with this series. It might not be as compelling as Caldwell's We All Fall Down or several other quality novels that explore the same teritory, but if you've read this far, I'd recomend picking this book up."
3,Fast Reading but not Up to Par,"Like other commentators, I am somewhat hooked on this series, even though I'm skeptical about its theology. In my opinion, the earlier novels were the most interesting, peaking at Book Six: Assassins. It may be because the latter books did little character development, and much of the action seems repetitious and dragged out. Too, some of the main characters take some really foolhardy risks here with insufficient motivation and wind up being killed off. Yet these books are really quite fast moving (although they are in no sense literature)and LaHaye/ Jenkins know how to write popular fiction and keep people interested."
5,"I won't Be Here, Will You?","By purchasing this book here, this completes my Left Behind series. I have not read this one yet, but I plan on starting from the first book and reading the entire series to the end, including this book! Great series, but really it was stretched out way too long though!"
4,Armageddon,"The 11th book in the Left Behind series picks right up where The Remnant left off. Like all of the others in this series, I found it to be a page turner that I could not put down.Fans of the series won't be disappointed, and the story takes some twists and turns along the way that I found unexpected.I don't know if there is going to be another book in this series, because it really didn't state whether it would or not. If not, then they did a fine job ending the tale.Recommend the entire series to anyone, especially any Christians who have not read the series."
1,Not again...,"Isn't this...over yet? Unable to look away, I picked this up and read most of it at my local grocery store. I was just curious to see if hyperconservatives LaHaye and Jenkins were finally going to end this ... series, which will likely be longer than the complete works of Robert Jordan by the time it's done. Alas, no.Once again, the ""final battle"" is put off for a future volume. Once again, the margins are enormous and the print is huge, so tiny-brained ... can think they're reading a big kids' book with chapters and everything.Once again, the writing is done on a third-grade level so there aren't any pesky ""big words"" to get in the way of the so-called gospel truth.... The only things worse than these books are the movies based on 'em."
2,The Title Is A Misprint....,"It should read ""Comic"" Battle. This book reads like a comic book moving from frame to frame at a jagged pace with characters acting irrationally throughout. The problem is there's no pictures! I agree with another reviewer. If the writers ( I should say millionares) stretched this out about 50 more pages they could end this once and for all. But let's go for the even dozen and a few more dollars. Of course you have to read it...you're hooked. But once you're finished you'll realize you're a few hours older and a lot less wiser. If you really want ""the battle of the ages"" watch the first Frazier vs. Ali fight."
2,I've stuck with it this long ... I might as well finish!,"I almost didn't buy this, but figured I might as well take it to the end. The first 2 and maybe 3 books of the series were great and I happily loaned them out to friends. My advice now is, ""Don't get started!""The writing style is obviously geared towards stretching out the story. The wide margins are a pitifull example of how the writers are milking the public for every last dime. This series should have been at most 6 books.What started out with a bang is going out with a whimper."
2,Disappointing,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. What I thought was going to be the final apocolyptic battle between good and evil was never contained in this book. It's just more of the same: the Trib Force evades the GC and changes hiding places. They kill off three of the main characters and finish it right before the battle reaches its climax. This was done so that people have to buy the next (and final, thank God) installment of the series. Left Behind has gotten rather old and repetitive and when they pulled this stunt, it just plain ticked me off."
5,Still going strong...,"I have read the entire series several times {always in hard copy, this time on Kindle} & am always amazed that I'm still picking up on things I missed on previous readings.I love this series - you know it's good when you laugh & cry & live & die with the characters, just like they're real people."
4,Wonderful Series of books,"I wanted to write a review on the entire left behind series rather then for each book individually, but it appears i need to write one individually for this book. I think this series has been one of the most enjoyable reads of my life. Whether you are a believer of not you can easily find this book to be an enjoyable read.The particular book is as exciting as any of the others, plain and simple, if you have read the previous ten then you probably have no need to read this review. The books are that darn good that you can't stop reading them.Over the course of these books the storyline increases quickly and progresses into a book that really makes you think and question what could happen...and if you are not a believer, it's simply a great work of fiction!I loved this series, the books are exciting and are very quick reads. Pick up the first one, i'll bet you can't put them down after that!Purchase this book after the tenth one, you wont be upset about this read!!!"
5,Can't wait for #12!,"2004 Can't come quick enough! This was the best of the series so far...I have become so attached to these characters and to learn of some in their passing, I cried and was joyful to see they were in a better place. Don't pass this one up - It's great writing!"
2,Manipulation through fear.,"I can't recommend this book to any serious scholar, only to those who may wish to include it with scary stories around a campfire to terrorize the kids. The people I care for look forward to a world full of life and promise, not death and destruction. These myths are perpetuated by a highly superstitious and dangerous mind-set...one I pray will never have access to nuclear armament in our military. They seem too anxious to ""end it all"" and ""be saved"". Love life, love our earth, and see God's wonders here and now. Don't buy into this scenario of mass destruction. It's a horrible MYTH."
2,Armageddon was great!,Everything! From the epic battle sequences to the explicit love scenes! I never felt so hot for religion. Tim LaHaye has made me consider straying from my marriage and having an affair with my best friend. He and I just love the whole Left Behind series. Christians Unite! And make love! All Night long!
1,Entire Series is Schlock Writing at Best,"Interesting trend in the reviews - either 1 star (the literate folk) or 5 stars (the Springer crowd). People, the entire series is garbage pulp fiction meant to feed off of fear and perpetuate one religion's mythos. Why would you give these people your money? Splashy covers don't make a good book. Do yourself a favor, stop reading and supporting these sad excuses for ""literature."""
1,Even More Christian Garbage-Propaganda,Pure unadulterated Christian propaganda to poison the already stunted minds of GOD's blind followers(or to use to initiate new recruits to the ever growing army of fools). A terrible waste of time and of creativity.
5,Fascinante!,"Este CD reúne dos de las tres obras mayores de Revueltas: Sensemayá y La noche de los Mayas (solo falta la obra maestra absoluta del compositor: Homenaje a Federico García Lorca). Como feliz complemento, el ballet La coronela, que Revueltas dejó inconcluso a su muerte en 1940. Las realizaciones son de primer nivel. La Orquesta Sinfónica de Aguascalientes y su director, Enrique Barrios, sobresalen en La noche de los Mayas y en La Coronela, y ofrecen una versión del clásico Sensemayá que no desmerece frente a las mejores referencias: Bernstein (SONY), Mata (RCA), Salonen (SONY), en orden de preferencia personal, todas disponibles en Amazon. La grabación es impecable. Muy recomendable"
3,Burnt out quick but think the fixture was to blame,"Used with a cheap unit for a flag light, burnt out in about a month. Think moisture in the fixture caused it however."
4,Marla sokoloff a singer.,"I came to find out about Marla sokoloff because I was a fan of her on many '90s tv shows. I found out after that she was singer because she was dating an actor who I really liked and they had just broken up. Anyways, he was talking about her writing a song about their relationship. I decided to look her up and instantly became a fan. I liked her style of pop/rock and felt her pain and anguish of previously frustrating relationships. Some notable songs, ""I told you so,"" ""save me from myself"" and ""I'm done."".I'm still waiting on her sophomore album."
5,Great buy,"These are smaller than I thought they would be, but they are still colorful and cute. Great for any child who likes to stack/unstack things."
2,Misleading pictures; very tiny product,"I was looking for stackable toys to take to the beach on our vacation, and these looked perfect for our 2-yr old twins to use in the sand. However, when we received the package, they were much smaller than expected. They're barely big enough to qualify as bath toys. Very disappointed, and the zoomed-in close-up picture that is marketed is very misleading."
3,Not so much fun yet for a 10-month-old?,Not so much fun yet for a 10-month-old? We'll see if my son shows more interest as he gets older.
5,Best gift you can ever give!!!,"This book is a true treasure which should be shared. Everyone should have a place to record there dreams and wishes...A goal/dream must be written down to be real...if not, it is just a thought. This book is the perfect way of allowing a person to be creative while recording their thoughts, wishes, and dreams. The perfect gift for a close friend or that special someone in your life."
5,A Thousand Tears Ago...,"Just like the title of this review, ""A Thousand Tears Ago"" is my favorite song on Kris' album. I've shared this CD with friends who all wanted a copy of it for themselves! I've bought four of them so far to give as gifts - one to a friend who is the mother of an aspiring young singer/songwriter herself and when she heard Kris she believed that her daughter would love it. And she did! I've heard that when the recording label that originally signed Kris went out of business Kris cried ""a thousand tears,"" too, but she has NEVER given up writing and singing and has many new songs that haven't been released (yet?). I have been privy to a few of the songs and I will be the first one in line to obtain the new album! Kris has a wonderful emotive voice and she's easy to sing along with. I simply cannot understand why another label hasn't grab her."
2,Wish there was a little more...,I wish there was a little more music to judge Kris Tyler by. Her voice is a little harsh on ballads but the songwriting can be considered a plus. I enjoy probably 5 of the singles from this album including Keeping Your Kisses and What A Woman Knows. Good album but nothing to jump over the moon for.
5,Great Blocks!,"I bought these for my 1 year old last year and he loved them. These were great because the colors and water captured and held his interest. These blocks helped teach my son his colors and now that he's a little older, he loves to build with them. My only complaint is that I wish there were more in a box."
3,Did I Get a Used One?,"I JUST received this item from Amazon and there are tiny scratches ALL over the plastic window of the blocks! They appeared to be dirty too! My gut tells me that they were used and NOT new...Not sure what to think, when you spend more on items you expect to have good quality. I will say that they are interesting, my kids all played with them right away. Buyer just be aware that they could be in less than mint condition."
2,"Nice concept, but bad in reality....and 6 blocks aren't enough.","This is an expensive idea....6 blocks is what you get, and 6 blocks aren't enough..... not even for my 1 year old, nor my 3.5 year old (both boys). We'd need to buy an additional 2 more sets just to get started, and that is another $60! Honestly, they are bigger & bulkier in person. If they were a bit smaller and came with 8 or 10 blocks, then they would be more useful. Guidecraft makes a better block set with the exact same design. I'm going to buy it to add to this useless set....Guidecraft Rainbow Blocks 10 Piece Set"
5,I love Laura Allan's first album. now this CD has 10 more songs!,"I loved Laura Allan's first LP when it came out in....1978? I still listen to it once in a while. Beautiful music and lyrics. I will always remember your music, Laura!"
5,Outstanding watch & prompt delivery,"The watch is beautiful and arrived on time. I needed a couple of links taken out of the band so it would fit, so after receiving it, I brought it to a jewelry store. While they were taking out the links, they also verified its authenticity. Additionally they guessed the price for the watch was between $975-1100.00. So, great watch & great deal from Amazon.com."
1,Can't Open the stupid thing!,"I have a Food Saver, which I dearly love, and thought this would be great for camping, boating, etc. It may be the greatest thing since vodka, but I can't open the battery compartment to put the stupid batteries in to see if it works at all.While I appreciate the reviews of others before me, I would have really appreciated it if, after they said they'd figured out how to open the battery compartment, they had told the rest of us!"
5,Great Tool!,This is a great tool. It is so easy to use and keeps things so much fresher. I would recommend this to everyone!
5,Works great! Don't forget the batteries!,"I was frustrated that it wasn't working, then finally read the directions-located in the battery area and it works like a charm on my chip bags, bread bags, and snack bags!I would recommend."
4,Handy in the Kitchen,"The Eurosealer is a handy kitchen gadget that works as advertised. In our home, it is more practical to use it on items that we won't be opening frequently such as baking supplies, etc. It can be used on potato chip bags, but it's easier and less time-consuming to use regular ""chip clips"" for that purpose. Once you seal a bag, it has to be CUT open. There is a handy cutting tool on the Eurosealer, but we don't want to have to keep cutting open chips and cereal bags."
3,How to change batteries,Does anybody know how to open the battery compartment of this thing? I can't find the instruction on the device or the packaging
2,Works sometimes,I got this from my mom and I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. Sometimes it seals and sometimes it doesn't quite. It takes some practice to figure out how quickly or slowly to move it across the bag.
2,seals sort of.,"It certainly doesn't seal as well as it claims on the package or in the insert. It doesn't really seal *any* plastic bag as it claims on the front of the package. Lightweight plastic don't really work. And after making three full line seals across my bag of cookies in a mylar type bag, it's still not quite air tight.I wasn't really looking to use it for freshness but to seal plastic bags for a craft project. It won't work at all on the bags I have for that. Either it doesn't seal or it melts all the way through, with no in between.Also it has trouble heating enough to meld areas with seams or double thickness (like a bag that folds in on the sides).But hey what do you expect for 8 bucks?Maybe I just haven't learned the little dance of the ""feel of the seal"".They do make more professional ones which work better, but they also cost upwards of 40 bucks."
2,weak,"i remember seeing this exact sealer a long time ago. when i noticed it while looking at others, i figured why not. wellmy grandmother always said to me that cheap is deare, meaning it is better to buy quality in the first place. rta"
3,"Works, but tricky","The Euro sealer does what its supposed to do - seal. However, you have to have a little bit of patience and practice. Once you get the trick down its a good seal everytime. If you hold and press for too long it will cut through the plastic. Hold and press gently, count 1:1000 - 2:1000 then glide it steady from end to end. This works for me. It may vary for others."
1,Bait and switch - sent me cheap copy,"The seller ""As Seen on TV Products"" sent me a cheap version of a generic sealer instead of the ""Euro Sealer"" advertised in the Amazon.com listing.The unit sent was cheaply made, lighter weight and had neither the magnetic back or bag opener. The seller had printed out their own paper label with ""Euro Sealer"" on it and slapped it over the ""As Seen on TV"" label. I already have a Euro Sealer (the same one pictured in the listing) so I know what I am talking about here.On the plus side, Amazon.com made immediate arrangements for a return shipping label and full refund.The original ""Euro Sealer"" is a great product that works very well as advertised - hence my order of a second unit. Just make sure you get the real unit. Here is the listing for the vendor who sent me the fake unit:EURO SEALER"
1,The Euro Sealer is Snake Oil,"Another snake oil product advertising on TV, it's too bad as that is the medium where a lot of REAL inventors get their start.The Euro Sealer might work on some bags, but I have not found any. The following bags I tried:Plastic Cereal bagsPlastic Bread bagsPlastic corn chip bagsPlastic pasta bagsand every other bag laying around the kitchen. None of them worked. I tried it fast, slow, I held the euro sealer on the plastic for a good 3 minutes on a single spot. It held for a second, but while putting the bag away it opened back up - the seal was that weak.If you're looking for a product to do what the eurosealer claims, you're going to have to spend more than $15 - more like $115, and get a vacuum sealer. Tupperware would also work, or zip-loc baggies. The euro sealer will not do a thing.The magnet works great and is very handy for putting up pictures on the fridge. Way to go magnet!"
1,Didn't work,This didn't work like the ones I used to have. I tried everything to get it to seal the open bag but couldn't get it to no matter how slow I went.
3,It'll get the job done...,"Instructions for assembly were extremely poor, but I've assembled these before.There were extra parts included and one of the rubber floor pads was missing."
3,maybe next time??,"The sealer works fine., BUT, the main problem is the lack of instructions, both on how to put it together and how to use it. The machine comes partly assembled with a diagram as the assembly instructions. It took many hours to figure out which bolt goes in which hole. After reviewing numerous pictures of it on the internet, I figured out where certain pieces belong. If this is your second sealer, this one is very reasonably priced."
5,Does the job admirably,"At first I was apprehensive; I liked the idea of a permanent tool in my dental care arsenal, and was tired of replacing rubber or plastic scrapers that would develop nicks or become worn every couple of months, but a metal tool? On my delicate tongue? I needn't have worried. It does the job better than the plastic jobs, and the narrower head is actually the right width; the wide plastic guys are much wider than any normal person (or even a big guy like me) needs. Also, the reduced width makes the gag reflex much easier to work around."
2,Buy something better,"I don't remember whether I threw out this product or gave it away (for free, it is arguably worth having around). Case Logic makes some great products, but this is not one of them. It is not sturdy as a stand-alone, so it needs to be propped up against a side of the trunk in order to be even marginally reliable at storing car products. There are much better storage organizers available."
5,Otro clasico de esta leyenda de la musica latina.,"Las voces de la talentosa Guadalupe Pineda y los trios famosos ""del Ayer y Siempre"" interpretando varias de las mejores canciones romanticas escritas por compositores de Puerto Rico, Mexico,Peru, etc. = cd perfecto para aquellos que buscan lo mejor de la musica romantica."
5,Love it!!,"One of my fav CDs. Had to purchase after hearing it in Castroville, TX shop. I listen to it all the time. Parts of it sound like a Mexican Peggy Lee. Love it!!"
3,"Ok, I know that","everyone else LOVED this book. I liked it as well. But I do have his other adult books so many of the illustrations are redundant to me. Also, I find him a bit smug and self-important at times. Most of the illustrations are extremely beautiful, but I disliked the children's books artwork, it seemed to me as if a different, more immature (in the sense of mastery of the craft) artist did those. I would have liked to see more paintings that had not been already published, as this book seems a rehash of his same old stuff."
5,a nostalgic slice of Canada before 'modern life',"The Happy Time by Robert Fontaine is a gentle look back at the eccentric adventures of an quebecois-scot extended family living in Ottawa ,ontario,in the early 1920's.These pre-'modern life' tales are sometimes sad, always funny, and never turn out quite the way you would expect.The evocative language used to desribe day to day living and the wild...yet recognizable characters that inhabit this family make you want them as your own.I found that I tried to read this book slowly so as to enjoy it as much as I could.You would do the same."
5,Review for Pro Basketball Prospectus 2004-5 Edition,"I have read a lot of this book and gained a lot of knowledge into how some of the statistical analysis is formulated by John Hollinger. Basketball is my passion, and I love statistics, so this book combined everything I wanted. I have ran basketball leagues before and I wanted to have a better way of rating players with the stats that we kept rather than just the basic ppg, rpg, etc. Sometimes the person who scores the most isn't really the best player in the league (or even the game) statistically. And John Hollinger shows how he came up with his formulas. I really appreciate the depth he goes into on each player in the NBA as well. I wish there was an updated Summer 2009 version out or coming out. This book is something I would probably buy yearly if it kept being published. I would like to see how it predicts some of today's best players and some of the rookies even coming in."
4,More for young adults,"As a skeptic and veteran reader of conspiracy and ""the unexplained"" books, this one left me a bit cold. There are others out there better suited to the adult reader (such as:The 80 Greatest Conspiracies Of All Time). However, for a very first introduction or for the teenage reader, this work is quite suitable. It is British based, so don't expect to find all-American greats such as the Kennedy or Martin Luther King assassinations, or other CIA or spy-time conspiracy. This books sticks to the paranormal, psychic, natural anomalies and UFO's."
4,"Great book, if you don't have MORALS!","This is a GREAT book. But there are flaws in it. If you simply decriminalize prostitution and not legalize it, employers might want to put 'must give head' as part of the job requirement for women.She also argues that no one under 25 should be allowed to be 'working'. Well, if the adults do it, why not the children?This is an immoral profession. But, if wanted to be done anyway, it has to be monitored tightly so that men in corp don't start taking advantage of female employees and start using loopholes in the laws caused by the legalization of prostitution."
5,"An interesting read, not your average prostitute...","Dolores is an exceptional woman in that as a prostitute she decides to experience every facet and level of the work. She starts out from the ripe age of 27 (most girls would consider retiring at that age) to begin escorting then working in a brothel and also trying street walking. She's quite brave (and crazy) but I don't understand why she would want to experience street walking when escorting is so much safer. Like I said, she is not your average working girl."
1,Straight A Books - No Good,"I'm sorry but Straight A Books sent me this Student Activites Manual missing 37 pages. I sent it back to them requesting a full refund and the payment has not arrived. I have been waiting now for over three weeks. Amazon is fine, Straight A Books has a problem. Sincerely Senegoth (Matt Darrow)"
3,Good job,Finally a decent knife that doesn't cost a fortune to own. Knives like this are mostly for show...but this one has practicality to go with it. You can actually use it for stuff. Pretty sweet deal.
4,Great knife for the money,"Well balanced, sturdy knife. Great knife for the money and comes with a very nice nylon sheath."
2,"Cook look, Poor Build.","This knife looks great, which is why I bought it. However the first camping trip I took it on, it broke. This is due primarily to the poor construction, specifically the tang. (if you can even consider what this knife has a legitimate tang)In summary, looks good, but does not work good."
2,Lets be honest about this...,"Just received my order today, 2 of the Knives. I ordered these because the origin says: ""Made in USA"". Since when did China become the USA? These knives are made in China. I wanted the craftsmanship associated with American Manfacturing,and the Winchester name. Let's get it right, Amazon. The ""Made in America"" is worth at least 25% of your pricing. Not to mention the volume on the orders because it's ""Made in USA"".How about reducing your current price by 25% and changing the origin to ""Made in China""?"
3,NOT made in the USA,"Before buying this knife I specifically looked for a model that was ""Made in the USA"" as is stated in the Product Details of this model (22-41206). After receiving the package I noticed much to my dismay that it is clearly marked Made in China. I am not happy about being duped by the details. I give it 3 stars because it appears to be a decent blade considering the source yet still not what I expected."
3,MADE IN CHINA!!!,"The knife seems to be decently made, however, in the product overview it states VERY clearly ""MADE IN THE USA"". I was happy to order the knife simply for this reason. When the knife arrived printed on the back of the packaging ""MADE IN CHINA""."
5,Nice manufactured knife,"The Winchester Bowie is the largest in a set of three. It has the same close quality control features as its smaller siblings, a very high standard. Sheath is real leather, perfectly usable.The affordable price of this knife and the 440 stainless steel utilized make it replaceable if lost, and assurable that the replacement will be of the same high quality."
3,"Nice, but not at the same time.","It's a nice knife. I enjoyed the hell out of it. It's balanced, being what I bought it for, for throwing. I stuck it almost everytime, but the times you miss mess it up bad the handle isn't very strong, the blade bends easy, but for everything else this knife is amazing, if you want a throwing knife, go German steel."
5,large knife,much larger than i expected this item to be when it arrived. very sturdy and durable. excellent for a gift
2,Amazing...until..,"I got this at wal-mart, AMAZING KNIFE Cept at wall mart...they called it a JR. machete. My guess was, it was A MACHETE TYPE KNIFE! I used it to cut bloodworms for fishing...washed it off in freshwater when I got home, Had traces of surface rust the next morning (not stainless) Took it camping with me a few months later after I fell in love with me, I fell 3 trees. (maybe 3 in diameter, Busted the blade in 3 slits off the main blade. Honestly, I lost my mind over how Id broke it.."
5,great knife,"good looking, well balanced, nice edge,I was sceptikle because of the cost but I'm glad I took the chance.if you want a great deal this is one."
2,Two seperate arrived with cracked handles,"This knife is a good size, design, shape, etc. That said, it is flawed. The first knife I ordered arrived with a substantial crack in its wooden handle, which started at the top of the handle and connected to where the first (brass?) connecting pin goes through the handle toward its top. It was not just a minor, barely visible crack, but a decent one which would likely grow over time, degrading the functional integrity of the knife. I sent my first one back through amazon's generally good return policy, and requested a replacement. The replacement arrived with a nearly identical crack. The manufacturing process, or storage, I'm not entirely sure, on this item is flawed and I can say you will likely receive a knife with a crack in its handle."
3,only 3 months,i bought this from walmart to save on shipping. it came with a paper cutting edge. it was my first fixed blade.after one month the tip bent so i put it in a vice.after two months the tipp broke off wile i was batoning. i continued to use it because it still had a cutting edge.after three months i was botoning again and a chunk of the edge broke offit was a very beefy knife that would make a wolf think twice
1,Buy it if you don't plan to use it,I bought this knife and received it about a week ago. I went camping this last weekend and used it like I do with my other knifes. At first it seemed to hold up and stay fairly sharp. then the blade snapped by the handle into 4 pieces. I abuse my knife when I test them. I had cheaper knifes hold up better than this one. If you want a real survival knife that will hold up for whatever your purpose is than this is not the knife buy. It holds up better on looks than actually using it. I'll stick to my K-Bar over this any day.
2,sucks,this knife looks awesome... but it sucks it is indeed full tang but the tang is tiny and crack within the first two hours of use. i was batoning through medium hard wood and it snapped in half i do not recommend this knife if u plan on chopping or batoning with it spend ten more bucks for the jungle primitive by sog great chopper and splitter
1,Dangerous if used,I bought this knife for a low cost trainer for bowie knife techniques. On the first strike to a medium hardness wooden target the knife snapped in half in front of the quard. The sheath is not bad but the knife is unsafe to use with any force.
2,alright,this knife gets all dented up on the blade and the hilt gets all wobbly i got this knife and the buck 0119 special and i would recommend my buck knife over this knife
4,Great value,this is not a cheap knife it is well valued it is large it is hefty (good) it is well made and reliable
5,Great Bowie for The Money,"This Winchester 22-41206 Large Bowie Knife with Sheath is everything as advertised. The quality, look and feel is superior. The sheath is very good and fits the knife very well. The shipping and delivery was as advertised and arrived in good condition, and within the timeframe expected. I HIGHLY RECOMMED the seller and will purchase from them again."
3,WARNING: Composition Titles Seem To Be Switched/Incorrect,"I'm confused. The Hudson River Suite and the Death Valley Suite seem to have the titles switched! Even the samples are incorrect. When I sample other albums that include the Death Valley Suite the music is the same as what this album lists as The Hudson River Suite. For instance, The track titled Hudson River Suite, Rip Van Winkle includes the Oh Susanna section that the reviewer J Scott Morrison mentioned comes from the Death Valley Suite and the dog barking mentioned in regard to the Hudson River Suite, Rip Van Winkle is the track titled Death Valley Suite: '49er Emigrant Train. The music is beautiful but I have no idea what I am listening to. Confusing and frustrating!!!!!"
3,Death Valley Suite,The Death Valley Suite is remincent of Grand Canyon. The Hollywood Suite/Ballet is uneven and is easily forgotten. The Hudson River Suite is pleasant.
2,102 surefire ways,This book was not really what I expected. Many of the ideas are old and not very inspiring to me - keeping in mind that I have been teaching for 30+ years. For younger teachers it may be fantastic!
4,Great product,"This is a great sticker. It went on very easily and looks great. I bought other stickers that were very noticicably stickers, not this one though. I would buy more of these! It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but it's still a decent size."
5,Ol' Eon never gets old,"Although Sylvia sings background with him on this album, it is primarily a solo album. It signals a new direction for Ian as this is more of a country sound than one would normally expect to hear from Ian Tyson. But it is an excellent album that bears hearing over and over again. I haven't heard anything from Ian that I didn't enjoy so for me this is just another in a long line of great albums."
5,Another good one,"I like everything that Ian Tyson does. I've never heard anything that I don't like from him. His great voice prevails through this as in all the others. I like all of his styles from the Cowboy & Western to the folk. He is an incredible musician with an incredible voice and I think it's good that lately he's experimenting with other styles rather than sticking to the expected. His voice and his arrangements are great no matter what he does, and this is another GREAT one."
2,SOOOO DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this toy in October of last year for Christmas for my 6 year old daughter. The sound didn't work when I bought it but thought I would just need to change the batteries. On Christmas morning my daughter was so excited to have received this toy, but to our dismay when we changed the batteries - the sound still didn't work. Of course we were over the 30 day return policy from Amazon so now she has a cheap plastic stage with Cinderella and the Prince. I have to say that the dolls themselves are nice. TOO BAD! This could have been a great gift. Don't waste your time."
5,Great album!,"I heard the band online and had to check out their album. After listening to it a few times I can say this doesn't disappoint! Restaurant has a great variety of songs by this very talented band. You may not understand the lyrics (everything's in Spanish), but this band still deserves a listen. Highly recommend."
1,"Failed after 3,000 miles","This cheaper part failed for my application (2001 Focus 2.0 Zetec) after only 2 months (3,000 miles). It started to squeak (telltale sign of bearing failure) as confirmed with a mechanic's stethoscope. Impeller is cast metal instead of Ford part's plastic design. Waste of time and money."
5,water pump,Satisfied with purchase. The pump arrived on time. I will be using amazon more frequently. So far it works very well.
5,water pump,"good quality, ship in time how it was said, easy to use and install. I will buy with you more THANK YOU!!!!!"
3,"Read It for the Facts, If You Can Stand the Lack of Flow","As a collector of all things related to the Clapham group, I was excited to get my hands on this new bio of Wilberforce. The facts, illustrations, sources, and anecdotes are worth the reading. However, the writing is unorganized--reminiscent of a lecture in which the professor forgets key points and goes back to insert them. That said, I applaud the resurgence of curiosity about Wilberforce, and look forward to the upcoming film production mentioned in the book."
3,Good -- not Great,"Too few pictures to precisely find the condition. Organized poorly. Once found, information is good."
2,Only purchase for reference.,"Seasoned UNIX users will have no use for this book at all. There is a brief (and i mean BRIEF) introduction to Socket programming at the end of the book, and a modest introduction to csh programming as well.The reason I purchased this book is I have been spending a lot of time with BSD unix flavors (Open/Free BSD, old solaris), and wanted to get a grasp of how they were different from SysV. I wanted to know things like file placement, differences in the kernel, and so on.This book provides none of it. Think of it as a primer users guide for unix. Not for somebody who is administrating machines.On its face, I certainly wouldnt even say it was worth half its horrendous... price. its a flimsy paperback with little value to anyone who knows the ins and outs of vi, ls, cd, and the other basic unix commands.Buy an OReilly book."
2,Religous Content,"I bought this journal and had no idea that there was religious content on every page. This information should be in the product description, but it is not. When I received the journal I found it to be smaller than I thought, and that it resembled a bible with gold edges on the pages and bible passages on the inside. The description of this item needs to be updated to indicate its religious content, and photographed to give the buyer a clear indication of the actual item they are purchasing."
1,Not for the Non Religious,"I was quite surprised to fnd the Christian ""fish"" symbol on the cover of the journal and further surprised to find a Bible quote on te bottom of each page. I was not looking for a religioue experience just a nice leather bond journal"
3,left out details,"I ordered this journal for my step-father as a gift. I was disappointed when I got it and there were quotes on the pages. This was not in the description and I felt very deceived. I felt that this was inappropriate for the seller to not include such a large detail about the product. However, my step-father is a preacher and I am hoping that he won't mind. This has definately changed my view of shopping online."
3,Good for a Gift,"I purchased this journal as a gift for my boss. It seemed a bit cheap and flimsy considering it is leather, but it was a good size. I also was not aware that bible verses would be printed on each page, but considering the person who was receiving the gift, it wasn't completely inappropriate. I don't recall seeing that detail stated in the original description when I purchased the item. This item would be a good gift for the appropriate person, but with something like this, it may be advisable to go with a journal you can actually see and feel the quality of before purchasing."
3,A little more description,"The quality of this journal is very good. However, there are ""inspirational quotes"" on every page which I was not aware of, so I returned it. I was going to use this to write about my girlfriend and then give it to her, but it would be weird to have quotes printed on the pages. So, keep that in mind. If you don't mind the quotes, go for it. It smells nice too."
3,Make Sure You Look at the Dimensions!!,"I purchased this journal as a gift, and when it arrived, I was disappointed at how small it is. Although the dimensions ARE listed on the description page, they are very small and I didn't see them when I ordered the journal.It IS a nice journal, if you want something pocket-sized."
5,Inspires you to write,Being a missionary overseas I felt it would be a great thing to start and keep a journal. Not wanting to use just a yellow note pad I ordered this leather journal. It is beautiful and actually inspires you to write.
5,Must have tool,"I replaced the upper control arm bushings on my 1981 Pontiac Trans Am using this tool. It made replacing the bushings a breeze. Instead of paying a shop to remove & possibly maul the control arms, I did it myself and correctly. Even if I have no further use for it, I can sell it and get most of my money back. Excellent."
3,Upper Control Arm Bushing Service Set.,"This tool set is just a bushing press. It will work in a number of situations requiring pushing a bushing out or in.I haven't actually used it yet, but I expect it will perform the job I purchased it for... If you are working as an automotive technician this tool is probably not for you; if you are a Saturday mechanic, like me, it is a good, inexpesive option."
4,Pure Entertainment,"Very entertaining. A fitting finale to the partnership of Kander & Ebb.The story is immaterial to the music. A strong cast carries off what could be considered a nonsense piece. Plaudits all round to the cast, writers and producers."
2,A sad finale,"I was surprised to read the glowing reviews for this recording. I love Kander and Ebb, including ""The Rink"" and ""Steel Pier,"" both of which I consider underrated. But ""Curtains"" is second-rate and would never have made it to Broadway without the Kander-Ebb names on it. Hyde-Pierce is charming, though Esparza deserved the Tony for his electrifying performance in ""Company."" Monk is unappealing throughout. Not a star. And poor Karen Ziemba, a real talent,is wasted. There is one good ballad and the Show People number which is catchy, but the rest of the score ranges from ordinary to embarrassing. The book is thin and the choreography is awful. We'd all like to remember Kander and Ebb's last show as an artistic success, but let' not deceive ourselves. This should never have come to Broadway."
5,"Whodunit?!? Kander & Ebb, That's Who!",What a terrific recording! Every word is crystal clear and delightful. This show and cd should rank with Chicago and Cabaret!
3,CURTAINS is likable but not special.,"There is nothing particularly great about this score, but it is likable, and it is Kander & Ebb's final work. That makes it worthwhile to have. The next time I am in NYC, which won't be until December, I would like to see CURTAINS, especially if David Hyde Pierce is still in it. I prefer revivals and old fashioned musicals like CURTAINS to the new shows with rock or folk rock scores, like LEGALLY BLONDE which I disliked."
5,All DAVID HYDE PIERCE FANS WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,"And even if you are not---the music is great!!!!!! This is the final collaboration between John Kander and the late Fred Ebb--plus throw in the efforts of Rupert Holmes (who wrote the underated MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD--and everyone's favorite guilty pleasure 70's tune--THE PINA COLADA SONG). Anyway, I always thought David was robbed of a TONY nod for SPAMALOT--so his win for this was quite overdue!Every song is a winner---and it is not just because of Pierce--Deborah Monk also has one of the great show stoppers ""IT'S A BUSINESS""!All theatre buff will enjoy--I certainly did!"
3,Very Pleasant,"Nice, witty and pleasant music. Sadly, as the teams last work, it is not on a par with their earlier efforts. I kept expecting the big, gorgeous, soaring ballad of other shows, but it never really comes. I still think Steel Pier is their best work (tho the show didn't work). However when you are the composers of Cabaret, The Happy Time, Zorba, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Woman of the Year, Chicago, and The Rink (among others...), you go down in history as one of the great songwriting teams in American theater.The performers are all first rate, David Hyde Pierce and Debra Monk are hoots. Karen Ziemba, as always, is wonderful. A major disappointment is that Jason Danielly's beautiful tenor voice is not given more to do. Overall, pleasant fun!!"
4,"It's No ""Chicago"" or ""Cabaret"", but Still a Fun Score!","From Kander & Ebb, who gave us the brilliant ""Chicago"" & ""Cabaret"", comes the last score they worked on together - ""Curtains"".The murder mystery, show-within-a-show is great fun and has an outstanding cast, including: David Hyde Pierce, Debra Monk, Karen Ziemba, Jill Paice, and Jason Danieley. The show's score may be somewhat inconsistent, but contains several great numbers:Show PeopleI Miss The MusicThataway!It's A BusinessA Tough Act To Follow"
2,A poor choice for doing DVDs,"After a lot of research I bought the Plextor PX-712UF to burn data DVDs. It is very picky as to media that I can use and I can only burn at about half the indicated speeds or I a get an error and another wasted DVD disk. Plextor goes on my ""never again"" list!"
4,Really cool ass considering the enhanced CD features,"The only thing this cd lacks is more songs. The songs on the album are great,but there are only 5, and if you already have ""Turn the Radio Off"" youve already heard 2 of them. However what it lacks in songs it makes up for in enhanced features,you can listen to the songs,watch videos,get info on the band,theres even a game.Overall a pretty damn good purchase."
5,A Definite Stray from the Fish,"This album is a short collection of songs that were thrown together but somehow work. The song Unity by Operation Ivy is shows its creators influence with a fish twist. I am a die-hard fish fan and you should be one too to buy this album. Also, three of the songs are found on Turn the Radio Off but this CD is still worth buying. P.S. It comes in an Enhanced CD format so you can put in in your computer and find a mini-game with the song 241 and tons of stuff about Reel Big Fish you never even though about. A definite plus."
1,Very disappointing.,"I thought I was buying a nice big book. What I got was a small paperback book plus a book full of blank pages, all put into a cardboard case to make the package look bigger than it is."
1,A ripoff,"I look at a lot of decorating books, and this one is a real ripoff. It sounded interesting and had a nice fat look to it. But take the booklets out of the cardboard box they are in, and you find a booklet with some information and then a fatter book that is nothing but blank pages. I wouldn't mind if this sold for [dollar amount] or something, but it's nearly [dollar amount]! The so-called 192 pages are mostly blank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the bit of information in the booklet is nothing new, nothing special, definitely not worth it. I am angry about spending that kind of money for so little."
5,Loved it! Didn't want it to end.,"This mystery is so well-written. I thought it was probably going to be one of these candy-cane Christmas mysteries, but not at all. The hero and heroine have to give murder mystery parties for their mansion/hotel guests in order to pay the mortgage. There's a blizzard and everyone's snowed in (which I love). They do an excellent job of creating a 1940's atmosphere,attending to every detail from old newspapers to cocktails served in that era. A few fake murders are planned and carried out and then a real murder occurs. My only criticism is that the guests never seem to react at all appropriately to the real death- they just keep right on playing the game. Doesn't matter. The writing is so good and the atmosphere so consistently compelling that the overall effect is just lovely. I have now ordered two other Babson books, Can't wait to read more of her."
1,Still havnt got it.,I cant review this product because a month latter... I still dont have it! They said they shipped it out 2 weeks after I purchased it but 4 weeks after I purchased it..... still no book!
5,Definitely nededed,"The more monsters the merrier. Seriously, the more monsters a DM has to pick from, the better the campaign is."
2,Tentacles AHOY!!,"Practicly every creature in this book has tentacles, and those that don't can easily be linked to other monsters. It seems that the fundamental design for these beasts was to take a standard monster, add tentacles, give it a name, and draw a [feeble] picture of it. When will creativity and innovation return to the RPG world of monsters? I would reccommend a cool book like the Fiend Folio instead of this <hee hee> Monstrosity."
3,MMII is not 3.5 Compliant,"A good book for its time, but DMs should take note that this book is dated. Monster description blocks are not 3.5 compliant. This means that the monster's Base Attack Bonus is not clearly listed, nor is the Grapple bonus (although most Swallow Whole descriptions define this variable). Also, Damage Reduction has changed significantly, so be prepared to make some on-the-fly adjustments. Otherwise I would say that this book is very usable at all levels."
2,Time for an update...,"Some interesting new entries in the D20 universe such as the infamous gem dragons :) but the format is still 3.0e and starting to show its age, very difficult to use any of the LA's PC possible entries...Save this purchase for last for the completisits out there after you have the MM, MMIII, and fiend folio in your collection. Actually after that I would probably recomend others still before the MMII, notably the advanced bestiary from green ronin which contains more interesting and up to date material than the aged MMII here."
3,NBA at 50,"This book just seems ancient now, but it captures the first 50 years of the league as well as anything. This is a good coffee table book."
5,Still the one,Have used for years. Still one of the best. My other favorite is good old Chapstick. Too many other products have ingredients that I am allergic to.
2,Not sure...,"My lower lip stays dry and usually has dead skin areas that cause lipstick to look bad. I had hoped this conditioner would remove the dead skin and leave my lip smooth. I've been using it several times a day for about a week and so far can't see a difference. It goes on smooth but doesn't last long. It does have a ""taste"" I don't care much for. I'll continue to use it and update later if it does what I need it to."
3,Interesting Read,An interesting and enlightening collection of essays regarding the Easter season. A very edifying book especially if read during Lent - in anticipation for the upcoming feast.
3,"Trying to Find a CD featuring the Group called ""TODAY""","Big Bub was the lead singer in this group. Can anyone help me find infomation about this group? They were produce by Teddy Reily in the late 80's. I'm trying to find the song called""Why you gettin funky on me"". Thanks"
3,WHERE ARE THE LYRICS????,"I'm looking only for the lyrics. If you have these of Big Bub ""I need your love"" would you be so kind and send them to me? Thanks a lot -Ariana-"
5,Local artist - should be national,"Great music, very up tempo. Excellent recording. Any jazz lover would like this."
4,Better than I thought!,"Great shade for the summer, especially when it's 110 degrees outside. Easy to put up and fold away, good price, just love it!"
2,Product has declined in quality,"I used to like this product, but on the last two, the edge material starts to degrade and leave particles all over the dashboard and front seats of car. Best to pay a little more (about $12) for a better-designed shade with durable edging."
2,ahmar,I will not but this item again as first it is very thin and when i used in on my car on a worse sunny day my car was hot even when it is on which means it has no shielding plus it became way too hot itself. It has suction cups with it and they are useless as they never stick to my car window.One more thing I was unable to track the package at all by using tracking number provided by the supplier and i have to send him email couple of times for this.
1,Too big to fit,"According to the packaging, my car (a Porsche Cayman) requires the jumbo size. It is WAY too big to fit though, and I've already thrown away the packaging so I can't return it."
3,It's ok,"It works as advertised, but I don't know how well it'll hold up. Small sections are starting to bubble and separate from the inner lining after three months in the Vegas sun."
3,Fine shade,It prevents the sun. The bandage fell apart from the shade after being pulled. But that doesn't matter. I can say it fits for my Camry L.
1,The trim turns to dust.,"This product worked great for about a month. After that I started to notice a silver dust on my fingers and dash and couldn't figure out what was causing it. It turns out the ""fabric"" used as trim disintegrates and turns to dust. I ended up throwing mine away rather than constantly cleaning my car's interior."
1,these are awful,u spend too much time trying to fold...they don't fit neatly across any car window I've seen...they bunch up even though the photo on packaging shows it as flat. piece of crap. a friend got these for me after my magic nylon ones tore up. mine are from a company called alpine gear but everyone that i know that has these hates them and eventually throws them in trunk or garage like i'm about to do.DO NOT BUY THIS
1,Trim falls apart under the Texas sun,"Buyer beware: the trim they use around the reflector is some kind of synthetic low quality fabric that just shreds and falls apart in the long run. I had to spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning my car from those black 'flakes' falling from all around the reflector. The reflector itself is very mediocre; however it worked well for the first month. Believe me, cutting a piece of cardboard from a large box would work better..."
4,Good end to a good series,"I enjoyed this entire series from start to finish, and not just for the obvious fan service. I thought the action sequences were well done and the English dubbing was better than most I've seen. The little kid does get annoying at times but that's her job so I can live with it. I'd found the first DVD for pretty cheap on its own so it was nice to find the option of buying the third one with the box to hold all three. As far as this particular DVD, it wraps up the story nicely without leaving any real cliff hangers. Being a short series there's no real time for origin episodes, but they did their best with the time they had. All in all, a good series if you're looking for something light, playful, and able to watch all the way through on a lazy Sunday."
3,This book is ok.,"I am not very familiar with Dylan's works but I bought this book anyway because I thought the 6 chords used would be simple. This turned out to be true. The chords are simple and if you forget some, there is a chart of all chords used at the beginning of the song. Since I have never heard of some these songs, I had to improvise on how it is played. Compared to other guitar related books, this one is fairly simple. There are no tablatures or written notes, just the lyrics with the corresponding chords. If there was a CD as a reference, this book would be good for a beginning guitar player."
4,"Good stories, good art","Bradbury, more than most well known SF writers, put a human face on his tales of maybe-if and far-away.Here, some of comics' best artists put faces on Bradbury's tales. On the whole, the matching of artist to story was brilliant. Jon J. Muth's watercolors illustrated an eerie, atmospheric experience within another mind. Harvey Kurtzman's geometric, brash figures walk through a noir murder mystery, narrated by the deceased. Richard Corben's piece opens the book, showing not a hero or has-been but a never-was, who screws up 65 million times over. P. Craig Russell's pictures give life to two stories, both that want the kind of majesty he puts into visual storytelling. All that, and lots more.These are good comics - masterful artists rendering a master's storytelling. Good for anyone who like narrative comics or who likes Bradbury. I have the good fortune of being both.//wiredweird"
3,Misprints!,"I bought this at lunchtime and sat in the car to read the first two stories. I found both Thunder and The City rather confusing and in fact began to think The City had the pages printed out of order (although there are no page numbers). So I though I'd the web! Sure enough, daveydooski saw it too.The occasional typo I can understand, but this kind of screw up is unforgivable!But I love Bradbury, and having some stories interpreted visually in this way is a treat. Only for the completist probably."
2,Belle for older child only,Disappointed in Belle! My 4 year old did not play with it as I thought she would (since she loves the movie & other belle dolls). Pieces are very small and get lost easily. Dressing was difficult. Overall not that impressive for the price.
4,Emily's Current' Favorite,"Given the number of mixed reviews on this doll, I thought I would add our 2 cents' worth. I actually found this doll, sans the necklaces, at a garage sale for $5 bucks! Now, you can't go wrong for that price, but my 3 year old loves her SO much that I bought the Cinderella doll for her birthday.It is challenging for little hands to manipulate the interactive pieces, but what a great excuse for Mom and/or Dad to play! When Emily tires of the rather limited recordings, we use our imaginations. An old-fashioned notion, but priceless in my book.For the 2-3 year old set, this nicely scaled doll beats the heck out of the 11 1/2 inch Princess dolls, which are impossible for little hands to manage well. This one is a WINNER!"
3,"Expensive, but my daughter loves it!","I am not overly impressed with this toy. I found it to be very expensive and I think the smaller pieces could be damaged easily so as not to work when ""plugged"" into Belle. However, my 6 year old daughter just loves it, sleeps with it at night, wears the matching locket, it is her favorite toy...so how can I put a price on that!! Of course this stems from her love of the movie so had I found a cheaper Belle doll I think it would have been a big hit as well without hitting my wallet!!"
2,disappointed,"My daughter was so excited to get this doll but she and I were very disappointed when we got it home. It is very difficult for a 4 year old to dress Belle and the fact that she has to be in her blue dress to explore the castle is frustrating. Many of the pieces are small and easily lost. The head fell off shortly after purchase and we were able to put it back on, though it was wobbly. Later the head broke completely off(of course after store return period)."
4,"Great Toy, weak neck","We bought this doll for our 4 year old daughter and she immediately took to it. She loves going through the little adventure that Belle talks you through. She even slept with it the first night. It's not as interactive as we thought, it's merely a series of prerecorded clips that are triggered by the items you put in her hand or the dress she is wearing, but for my daughter she thinks it's great. Our only gripe is that the our normally careful little girl somehow managed to break the head off in one day. A little superglue has reattached it temporarily but we're hoping that Playmates will help us restore the doll with a replacement ... I'll let you know."
3,troymom,"In a nutshell- my 4 year old daughter loves Beauty and the Beast and has enjoyed playing with this doll since she recieved it last Christmas. I have three complaints however. The first one is that she and her friends need my help getting Belle changed (and it seems she always wants a different dress on). Secondly, my daughter likes to do her doll's hair and Belle's hair is hard to brush and gets tangled easily. Lastly and most importantly, a few days ago Belle fell off the bed and her head just broke off. I read that other people have had problems with body parts falling off. We have never had a problem with other toys breaking. It's a shame we paid $45 for a doll that lasted less than a year."
1,head fell off,"We bought this for our daughter's third birthday and she adored her...taking her everywhere with us. But the same as all the other reviews, she couldn't dress her, and had a hard time inserting toys into her hand and was bored with the talk. She always need our help with her and cried so hard when her head fell off after only 1 month! (Her birthday was 2 months ago). You can't glue the head back on either. Good general idea but very poorly made. Would not recommend since she falls apart!"
1,Hi I am 5 my name is Bobby,hi MY Name is boBBY ansd i am 5 and I brought thIs do//ll for mysElf becauSe i hAve a CruSh on BellE but aS i wAs hugged It IT'S Head FALLDED off And de HaiR falldeed Of TOO and mY mommy IS happy tHat I ate my BreakfasT AND wE TOOK THE DOLL back did not Refund MomMY is Coming BYE BYEBoby
2,Save your money,"After our purchase of Cinderella last year, ""Santa"" brought Belle this Christmas - we should have learned our lesson - our 4 year old who is great with her hands has a difficult time dressing these dolls and keeping up with all of the parts needed to operate them. In addition, Belle's arm cracked off which really surprised me considering the cost of the doll. After putting it off as long as possible, I took Belle to the store to see if ""Santa"" had left his extras (with receipt dated 11/02) and after going through manager after manager, we received a refund because there were no more on the shelf - Wonder Why?? Wrote Santa a letter asking for a replacement, thank goodness I have read these reviews before blowing the money on another."
3,hard toy to play with,"My 5 year old daughter begged for Belle this year so when Christmas rolled around we thought we'd buy her. This doll is such a pain! The dresses are very hard to remove and put on. She insist on having the blue dress on to explore the castle she refuses to let you explore the castle without it on her. I admit I finally cheated because my daughter insisted that she put back on the yellow ""formal"" dress by plugging the connection for the blue ""everyday"" dress in to the socket in her back to fool the computer chip. Belle also has to have her left hand pressed to continue her adventure which is REALLY hard to activate. I have to press her hand everytime and even I have a hard time doing it. So while my daughter loves the doll and enjoys playing with it I'd suggest saving yourself the money and aggravation and buy a different Belle toy for your child."
1,Don't waste your money,"This toy is the worst-- the head fell off after a month of very infrequent play due to my childrens lack of enjoyment with it. I have a 2 and 5 year old princesses who NEVER played with this toy and they adore anything princess related. The dresses were hard to remove, the interactive toys were always missing, the hair is of extremely low quality, it cannot even be brushed with the brush provided. As soon as you brush it, the hair is ruined. What a waste of money!"
2,"Had to take it back to the store, it broke after 2 days","We purchased this doll for my 7 yr. old who simply loves Belle from the Movie. We were very much disappointed with the doll. ..., the pieces are small and easy to lose. The items that Belle asks for are difficult to place in her hand. The dresses are difficult to take off and put on. She says the same things over and over and that gets pretty annoying after awhile. We were going to keep the doll and place it on a shelf. However, after owning it 2 days, it stopped working altogether. My daughter was very careful with the doll, so we knew it was nothing we had done. We returned her to the store and got a refund. I asked my daughter if she wanted another one, and my daughter told me no, the doll is too much trouble. I agreed."
2,HEAD FELL OFF AND NO HELP FROM MANUFACTURER,"This was my daughters favorite toy. She had it for about 2 weeks and played with it constantly. She wouldn't go anywhere without it. One day she was playing with it gently and the head fell off. I tried taking it back to the store and they refused. I tried contacting Playmates Toys Inc. The only way to contact them was through e-mail and I never received a reply. About 2 weeks after my initial contact with them they called me. They told me that this toy was no longer available, that it was only produced for 6 months and only sold to Sam's Club. I was also told that there were no more dolls any where in the world for sale. Much to my dismay I found them here one week later. Not worth the money if you don't already have a child attached to it!!The doll is very hard for children to dress and it does not give you enough time to change the dresses for the story to continue. The interchangeable parts are hard for small hands to handle."
5,6ft Double cross folding Shoji screen,"I needed the screen to separate some area in our finished basement. The product is well made, no imperfection. The shipping was extremely fast. The packaging was excellent. The price is very good. The seller have their own website but for some reasons it was much cheaper to buy thru Amazon.com. I will buy again from them."
2,Thin bottom does not heat evenly,"I needed to replace an Analon covered saute, and many reviews indicated this would be comparable quality at a more affordable price. But the aluminum is very thin guage and does not heat evenly. If this were a $20-$30 pan I would call it good value, but I expect anyone spending $50 or more for a pan would expect better. I certainly did."
1,Warped after 1 year!,"I used to love this pan because it's size and the matching lid are so practical. But after about a year I have experienced the downsides of Kitchenaid cookware design.First of all, like all anodized cookware this cookware is not dishwasher safe and after a while I really started hating my pots and pans for that. Who still has the time to scrub their cookware by hand every single day? Further, the metal handle on this specific pan gets pretty hot and you have to use a towel to hold it if you want to mess with the food inside - bad design! Finally, after about one year the bottom of my pan warped and it has now only contact with the cooktop in the center and wobbles horribly. I did not heat an empty pan, which is what Kitchenaid warns of, but come on, you have to be able to set it on high when trying to sear sth or bring the pan up to the correct temperature without the bottom giving up on you!I guess I'll have to invest in some real cookware that you can actually cook with!"
3,"good headphones, bad service","The headphones are great, with a solid feel and excellent sound. The ear cups are actually fairly heavy, and tend to slip down if you walk while wearing the headphones, but are fine for home use. The problem with my set was that the left speaker shorted out after about 4 months of use, without explanation. The JVC service website didn't even list this product and I was unable to get through to customer support by phone. These were great headphones for a little while and I haven't found another pair in the same price range with as nice a look, sound, and feel, but if you plan on buying them I would go for an extended warranty."
5,Fits DLC-7,"This stem is just what I needed. I have an older, DLC - 7 cuisinart and I wasn't sure which parts to get. This one fits the DLC-7 model. It may fit other models too, I don't know but it does fit mine! Delivery was quick, product exactly as advertised."
4,Back in business,The detachable stem is the correct part for our old Cuisinart. It came promptly and has us back up and running!
4,"Very good, could be better",The quality of material and construction is good but to make it even better the clips should be in an insulated cone to reduce the possibility of accidental shorting. Length is good too.
3,Good but out of date,"This is a great book, but the most recent edition was written in 2002. Therefore, it recommends things that aren't there anymore and omits things that you shouldn't miss. Even so, my 7 year-old enjoyed having her very own guidebook and picked out a number of activities for our vacation from it, including a few (like DuPage Children's Museum) that we would never have found without it."
2,c475 Power hog,"I purchased this back in May.This unit costs about $70 per month to operate.There should be a energy saver mode to conserve electrity.It cools and works though.The remote control is poorly designed. The remote is in C degrees while the unit is in F degrees.I wouldn't buy this unit again. I'll replace it next summer for sure. The costs for me so far was $500 for the unit, plus about $50 for shipping, plus $70 per month to operate. (Money down the drain)."
3,Sweaty underarms? This may not be the best solution.,"While a good idea in theory, the underarm shields are a pain to adhere (they can get stuck to themselves while you are trying to adhere them to the clothing) and the perspiration may 'leak' over the edges of the shield. I think biofeedback may be cheaper in the long run, and better for you too. :-)"
5,GREAT! better than i thought.,"so. i'm a flight attendant and i'm going thru perimenopause (i know. too much information!) so i have hot flashes all the time! like worse than I heard it was going to be! it's so annoying and i can't control it. I sweat thruout the day and night and my work shirts are getting the worst of it. underarm yellowing and smell. I googled sweat help and somehow, many forms of shirt pads came up. some are stick ons, some are snap to bra. some are disposable, some washable. i bought both. this is the disposable stick ons. i wore them on my last flying job. wasn't sure how to apply the pad but one i aligned it to my shirt, it worked! i mean, i sweat still but at least my shirt is saved!it's gonna be costly ultimately buying them all the time or....i'm going to try the washables next. see how they work.but this will suffice for now. hope it works for you!"
2,Hard to use,"This was a tough product to figure out. The pads are very thin, and not really formed to fit a shirt (circular in shape). I am one to not leave extra time in the mornings, so trying to put them on in the mornings is tough, and I sweat more than they will hold, so they don't really work for me. Once you put them on, your shirt will bunch up where the pad has stuck onto your shirt, which creates unnecessary discomfort."
2,"hot, not so hot","they are very hard to place onto clothing without sticking together, need to practice, turned out didn't need them for my dress"
1,The pads stick so tight to your clothes it takes a LONG time to get them off.,The pads stick so tight to your clothes it takes a LONG time to get them off.It takes rubbing alcohol and about a half hour of time per arm.
2,Too big for smaller cut t-shirts,I was really looking forward to getting these and was disappointed that they are too big for feminine cut t-shirts. They also show through if the t-shirt is at all sheer. Maybe there is a different product that I should have purchased but these don't work for all shirts.
3,Not so easy to use,"They are not meant for a short sleeved shirt since part of the pad goes into the sleeve, so not really good for use in the summer (when I intended to use it primarily). Secondly, it's thin and sticky, so you have to be careful while lacing it, I had to throw one of the two away because it stuck the wrong way the first time and didn't stick anymore."
2,DIFFICULT ITEM,"ITS NOT AN EASY ITEM TO USE, IF YOU TRY TO PUT THEM ON YOUR SHIRT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THEY SLIDE AROUND. SO YOU PUT YOUR SHIRT ON FIRST THEN TRY TO POSITION THE PADS, PROBABLY WONT BUY AGAIN"
1,Not easily removable,"These worked ok until I tried to remove them. Each shield has three adhesive strips that basically melted to the lining of my suit jackets. This made them next to impossible to remove. After spending a lengthy period of time pain stakingly peeling away all the little shreds of plastic and glue left behind, the fabric is incredibly gross and sticky. I would not recommend this product."
2,was worth the try,On a scale of 1 to 10 my hyperhidrosis problem is a 12. The pads worked for 20 minutes and then I started sweating around the pad after it was soaked. Good for quick appearances... and I mean very quick.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. The shape of the pads don't fit any shirt underarm area; it is stiff so can't be used on thinner (cotton, silk, stretchy) shirts or dresses. Overall I am disappointed."
5,Love This Product,I can't say enough about how much I love these disposable underarm shields. They work and really keep me dry throughout the day. I will recommend to my friends.
2,will try another option,"These pad are so tricky to apply to your shirt. the adhesiveness is so strong once it sticks it is very difficult to remove, I was worried it would pull out the seams on my clothes. not sure if I would purchase again"
3,Disposable Dress Shields,"Provide protection but are very large! Not really something you can wear under a t-shirt without some adjustments. Really made for long sleeve shirts, are somewhat bulky."
2,Loud and crunchy!,"Despite saying they will not bunch, they constantly bunched up and were loud under my garment. Wore them once and won't wear again. Save your more for dry cleaning!"
2,Ouch shields,"Great concept but did not work for me. The shields ended up moving and then sticking to my skin, OUCH! It also depends on the type of shirt you have and it did not work for alot of my shirts."
3,okay,"The pads work okay, but they aren't very comfortable to wear in your shirts. They stick to the clothes too strongly too."
3,Find the right shield,"These shields would be great for people who are not as active as I am. I have used the shields with the stronger adhesive and I prefer them. Overall, I am very pleased with Kleinert's products."
2,Not very practical,"I found these underarm shields to be too stiff, cumbersome, noisy, and thick (you can see them --or the outline of the pads--through most dress shirts). Also, worst of all, the pads failed to adhere to my shirt securely. I wouldn't recommend."
2,It didn't work like I was hoping it would.,"It didn't lay flat like in the picture.....Also, trying to peel off the strip tape was time consuming...I wish I had ordered the pads that fit in bra strap instead, I think I would have gotten better results....If I could have sent them back, I would have...The pads didn't absorb anything, because I couldn't get them to lay flat or fit properly."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"These 24 disposable underarm dress shields from Kleinert's are reasonably priced, but they are not top quality. The adhesive is too strong, causing the shields to be hard to remove from the garment before laundering. Better quality shields can be removed in one piece."
3,not black in color,"I was pleased with the over all look of the rack, but I did not get black. I thought the picture showed the rack as black. I will try it in my kitchen, but may have to send it back due to the color. I also wonder if it will hold all my pots as it is a very light weight as stated in the description. The box was very beat up and it did not have directions. The rack came in a timely manner when they said it would arrive."
4,Better than I expected,"I own several pairs of headphones from Beyerdynamic, AKG and Sennheiser. I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. These headphones really suprised me when I bought them for a knock-around pair. Great clarity, great sound stage. The only thing is that they are lacking in the bass dept. But if your music source has a ""bass boost"", then these things sound just as good as my much more expensive headphones. I have not owned JVC stuff since the 80's, but am now once again a fan."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Araminta Station's setting is one of a planet so uniquely beautifulthat the number of people allowed on the planet is incrediblyrigorously enforced.The small number of people there does leave said populationvulnerable to crime. This, of course, happens. Vance has designedanother weird and whacky society for trouble and strife to happen in,again centred around a young male protagonist."
1,BORING!,"I have read this book and I wonder if it is the same Stephen King who wrote The Tommyknockers or It, which I really enjoy. I totally agree with the criticisms written in this review and I don't understand how people can rate it with 5 stars... Maybe Stephen's got a big family!Sorry for my poor English, I'm French!"
2,Alright....,"This book did not blow me away, like King's other works, ""The Stand,"" ""Christine,"" among many others.It started out as a highly enjoyable tale that gave me a sense of ""Grumpy Old Men meets Stephen King,"" but quickly took a bad turn into...BORING LAND.After about a hundred or so pages, King just writes ON and ON....I was really amazed at how much he just babbles in this book. The mindless, nonsense writing OFTEN stands in the way of the plot.While reading the book, if you so dare, you will probably stand back at all this babble and say...""Mr. King...does anyone REALLY care? GET TO THE PLOT, sir!""The only redeeming qualitie of this book is the off-and-on plot. Yes, the book becomes awful to read when the storyline goes by-by, but when the plot DOES show up, there are some pretty powerful story devices in there.I only reccommend this book if you are looking to waste time."
1,This book is not a testament to King's talent.,"Prior to this book's publication, I read a magazine article where King explained during an interview that he was writing a book titled Insomnia. He revealed that he had to abandon his work because the plot was not working out. Mr. King, what on Earth ever made you change your mind? I abandoned your book after page fifty for the very same reason not to mention that it was BORING. A more appropriate title may have done your book better justice -- like SOPORIFIC or SLUMBEROUS."
1,"Insominia cure, more like","""Sleeping Pill"" would have been a better title. This hefty lap-crusher is an unbelievable slog, an absolute disappointment from the repetative, meandering start to the drawn out finish. Where, oh where has my Stephen King gone?"
1,The Cure For Insomnia,"Jesus -- where to begin? When you have 800 pages of crap, it's difficult to tell. By the way, in case you don't find this review informative, you might want to check out my treatments of King's ""The Regulators"" and ""Desperation"" to get a better idea of what I like and dislike about the man. But we have on display here some of those same things from the above referenced books that I find very irksome: rampant political correctness, totally unnecessary and unrelated to the plot, (conservative ideas would be just as annoying in this context) childish gore that is as frightening as anything a seven year old could come up with, (""Her head swelled and then exploded, thousands of huge roach-like bugs came streaming out of her skull and began running into her open and screaming mouth"", etc., etc.) Oh the horror! However will I sleep tonight?Did you like the part where Ralph and Lois begin shooting blue beams out of their hands and fingers as if they were guns?"
5,My favorite King so far,"It's a great peripheral tale to the Dark Tower series, with all the trademark elements of King stories. Oddball characters, and that creepy little town, the seamless blending of reality and... hyperreality?"
3,You Won't Forget Ralph,"Old Ralph the hero of this novel is a terrific character. He's the kind of man you'd want for a granfather. When the action finally takes off---it takes a long, long time to do so--you will care what happens to him and his love, the feisty Lois. The book is too long and at times it seems more like a literary experiment than a fully worked out novel."
2,Not worth the effort,"With a deja vu from Needful Things, Insomnia has about 250 unnecessary pages of fluff, padding the way to possibly one of the most unsatisfying climaxes I've ever come across. It begins much like Bag of Bones, with a painfully long development of the main plot. Admittedly, there are a few good chapters in the middle, once the plight of the main character is revealed. After that, though, things drag on unsatisfyingly. The only thing that kept me reading was the allure of finding out who the ""Crimson King"" really was. Talk about disappointment.Save your time & money."
2,A good cure for insomnia...,"Unlike most of King's novels, this one took me forever to get through. It was a great cure for my insomnia..."
4,Potential to be the best ever!,"The first 2/3's of this book are among Stephen King's best. But as he is occasionally apt to do (as in the miserable Tommyknockers), the story veers off into the surreal. By the time I reached the final page, I was just glad it was over. My advice? Read the first two thirds and just imagine how cool the ending could have been."
5,Can't turn the page fast enough!,"This is a book that I quickly read. I seriously couldn't put this book down. The story is about a widower who begins to see things that the normal person does not see. It is up to him and his friend Lois to stop something terrible from happening.That's all that I will say from the story. This novel, I think was also a bit of a political statement. If not, it was still a fun read!"
3,Dark Tower Background Required,I just don't see how casual readers of King could enjoy this book to its fullest. This book is essentially a Dark Tower book on a tangent and even with that I give it 3 stars. My enjoyment of this book was primarily due to its overall fit in the Dark Tower universe rather than the story at hand.For those readers planning to read this as a stand-alone novel who have no prior knowledge of the Dark Tower series I rate this as 2 stars. I can promise that you will have no idea what he's talking about and why some things happen the way they do without any DT background.One other thing: if you are pro-life you may find yourself getting a little hot under the collar at times. While King discusses the fanatical personalities and extreme measures of people that can surround an abortion debate (on both sides) the pro-lifers are definitely held in lower regard in this novel.
1,For all Insomniacs out there...,"If you have trouble sleeping, get this book! It'll knock you out in no time. Yes, Stephen King succeeded in writing the most boring book in his career. If you manage to get through the first 200 lid-drooping pages, you will be disappointed, because it just keeps getting more boring with each subsequent page. Makes you yearn for the days of book-burnings."
1,A terrible read!,"I've read Stephen King books since I was about 12 years old. Most of his storys send chills down my spine, but after reading this book, I lost almost all respect for Stephen King. It starts out with a lot of potential, but as the story goes on I found myself cringing at its stupidity. It is so far-fetched and unbeleavable that if it had less profanity, it could be listed as fairy tail. I wouldn't recomend this book for anyone intelligent! All in all, a terrible read!"
5,Insomnia by Stephen King,"The book was in perfect condition, every bit as nice as described. Shipment was quick and packaged well. In my opinion, this is the best book Stephen King has written. Very good read!"
2,"Uninspired, Time passer","This novel falls just short of average. It really doesn't challenge the reader in any facet of original thought, and the characters are interminably dull. I did not choose to finish after about 600 pages, so I'm still not sure how it ends, although the plot became rather predictable at that point so I have a good idea of what happens, I just failed to care by page 600. It is annoying to invest time to read 600 pages only to finally make the decision that I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant reading any further. The dialogue between the characters is contrived, and worse, the characters do not seem distinctive. They all act, think, and talk similarly so the whole town kind of dissolves into one old, boring morass. There is also some relatively lame science fiction, laser powers shooting out of people's hands, which is just tired. I would suggest looking elswhere for entertainment -- at least this book didn't do it for me."
2,"""Zone"" clone","I liked this book the first time I read it -- WHEN IT WAS CALLED ""THE DEAD ZONE"". Really, the ""innocent-psychic-stumbling-upon-political-assassination-plot"" storyline was interesting once, but not twice. King writes too much, and it's no wonder he has the reputation (in some quarters) as a verbose [writer]; and this self-plagarizing, recycled piece of rambling nonsense backs that accusation up in spades...."
1,I fell asleep in the first 100 pages,"Couldn't hold my interest. Too slow, boring. Pass it up - save your money for something you'll remember"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This is by far the worst Stephen King book I have ever read. It is titled Insomnia but it really is a sleeper. It lacks excitement and the nail-biting, heart stopping talent that King exhibits in his other epic's and novels such as The Stand, The Shining and Geralds Game, to name a few. There was no mystery in this book and it left me feeling nothing more than annoyed that I wasted my time on reading it.If you are a die hard King fan, than the chances of my review stopping you from reading this are slim, however don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Hunter is right - another klunker,"I have to agree with Hunter (8/26/96). I haven't read agood book by Stephen King since the one before Tommyknockers.(I found Tommyknockers a bit too slow-moving.) When I readThe Stand, I thought it would have been a much better bookif the first 400 pages had been reduced to about 200. Nowthat I am slugging my way through Insomnia, I feel the sameway. By page 300, almost nothing has reallyhappened. Will anything ever happen, other than a stray dog shivering at sights unseen by others? I regret having begunit, but keep hoping that it will pick up.Stephen King's books used to hold you in their grip. You are afraid to stop reading, because you are at such an exciting point. Something crucial or scary is always about to happen.The Shining had me afraid to go out of my bedroom at night.I can barely stay awake to read Insomnia."
3,Yet another klunker from King.,"I really wonder nowadays just what the heck Stephen King isthinking. While I'm a huge fan of his earlier works...anything he'sdone after The Tommyknockers (outside of his Dark Tower series) has just fallen totally flat for me. Insomnia is yet another reminder of how he's lost his way. A monster of a novel, clocking in at 787 pages, it lacks the laser-like focus on character and dialogue he used to propel such other long novels as IT and The Stand. Insomnia meanders to and fro...but these side-trips no longer seem like fun diversions from the main narrative, they're just fat that needs to be trimmed. Even looking only at the core of the story, which deals with a man afflicted by terrible insomnia after his wife's death and his subsequent visions of people's life-forces and little bald men running around with scissors, you see only an interesting premise. This is what Stephen King's books have turned into. A nugget of a good idea, buried alive by filler."
3,Original although forgettable...,"I think the whole book would result a very good short story and that is all. In some points of the narrative the book seemed to take off, but it was just an illusion. Climax could be far better. My feelings about this book? What a waste of a good idea!"
4,A Pleasent Surprise,"I honestly wasn't expecting much of this book, but I was delighted to find it took place in Derry (Those of you who read IT know what I'm taking about). Insomina has believable characters although the story of couse, is a bit far fetched. This is a good rainy day book. You'll like it a lot better if you read IT first."
3,This book was Okay,"Ralph Roberts doesn't seem to be able to get to sleep latley. He's starting to see things. Little Bald Docters and strange colors. Oh yeah, his next door neighbor is insane too."
3,A good book but Not his best!,This is a good book but it takes way too long to get going! There are 600 and some pages and I didn't know the point of the book until 400! But it is worth reading. Steven King has an imagination!
2,I was very disappointed,"I am a Stephen King fan of old, and Insomnia is the only book of his I have ever read that I had to wade through. It started off really well, then lost me after page 100 or so. I spoke with another friend who simply stopped reading it and never finished it. I must say though that he thoroughly redeemed himself (not that he really needed redemption) with Desperation. He still is and will remain my favourite author."
2,Not the best,"I was disapointed in this book. It was not bad, but I felt the ending sounded as King was rushed to finish this book."
1,help!!!!,"I've tried to read this book a few times over the past four years, and it's just so slow for so long, that it's hard for me to get into it. Any advice out there on when the book gets better? Do I need to get past the first 200 pages before it gets better???"
1,Good book!,"I wet my pants five times while reading this book! Then I put my head in my butt! It really was a good book, if you know what I don't mean in here. Cyberspace is in the flesh and spiritualness! Poopy doopy doo dah day"
1,BORING,The absolute worst King book ever! Took me forever to read it. The only thing that kept me going was stubborness. Do not waste your time on this!
1,"Oh,No","I've read a lot of king's work, and this one was just terrible. If ya want King read The Shining,IT,'Salem's Lot or one of his better ones. I personally just didn't like it. Everything was bad.It just didn't seem like King. It wasn't him.It didn't have any flow, it was dragged out and the whole plot was bad. It isn't worth it."
2,yawn,"It was a drag from start to finish. Mr. King really didn't achieve much on this one. I will applaud the imagination of the story, just poorly told. Lots of pages of boredom. Highly recommended if you're in prison and have a lot of time."
3,Ehhhh,"This book had two things going for it: Stephen King's name on the front cover, and all the wonderful references to the Dark Tower storyline. He even mentions Roland by name, near the end.The rest of the story, I don't know. I like the idea of seeing auras, and the shifting between planes of existence...but I think I agree with the other reviewer who said that this book would be a good cure for those who suffer the titular condition."
5,this and IT are Kings best,Insomnia is the best book that I ever read. It is wonderful!!! This and It and Eyes of the Dragon are the best. The worst that I have read are Apt Pupil and ALL of the dark tower books. This book is impossible to put down. Anyone who says that its garbage is not in their right mind!!!!!!!!
3,Hard Reading,"I think King has done an excellent job writting this book. It is very involved though, and sometimes can not be followed without reading over things more than once. King was successful in measuring up what he usually writes."
2,"Insomnia was potentially good, but seemed too disorganized.","The book started off great with good character development and soom intriguing occurrences, but then it seems to fall apart. The plot drags on and on, with no real twists and turns. Also, the book is loaded with unnecessary characters and small events, which leads the reader to wonder why King wrote certain sections of the novel. This book could have been really good had it been 300 pages long, not 800."
2,Could it get anymore boring?,"I bought this book the first week it was out. I found it to be extremely boring and put it down half way through. Since then I have tried to finish it, but find myself getting drowsy after only 20 or so pages. This is the only King novel I have never finished."
2,Too Theoretical,"I was a little disappointed with this book, especially after finishing The Stand just prior. I found it to theoretical, to many connections to ancient history, like the three bald doctors being the three witches from the myth of Hercules. ANd was it me or did the crimson king seem like the monster in It? if you read this and It, give me an answer. If the story grabs you read it, if not you really didn't miss much."
3,It was childish...,"The first part of the book was very boring. Not many people like to read about old people and their lives. By the way, what does Ralph's wife being dead have to do with the story? All i can see is that that made it easier for him to be with his old hag of a girlfriend. Anyways, i found it childish in a sense. Little midgets which kill you isn't something i prefer to read about. Maybe a 3rd grader would write a story about that but Stephen King is a grown man! I am only 13 yrs old and i find it very immature to write about that. I can find worse, like dolls or stuffed animals but elves/midgets are bad enough. And i don't see where the women that were abused fit in either. Stephen get your act together and write some REAL works of art! I like reading your books but, only if they have a reasonable genre. I have seen worse books by you, like Cujo, but i think you are capable of writing with real talent."
3,doesn't CAUSE insomnia,"not a truly terrible book because it has some interesting ideas, but mostly it had way too many boring parts to be truly enjoyable. stephen king has definetely done much better. on reading past reviews of the book i see that a lot of people are suggesting one reads 'the dark tower' series to truly get the most from 'insomnia', and well, i actually haven't read them, so..."
1,"Good book, Terrible audio book","I wish I could offer a better review on this. The book, wasn't one of Kings best, but certainly not a bad book either.The problem lies in the production of this audio book. The background ""music"" (Read NOISE) is harsh, jarring and disruptive.While most of the reading by Mr Eli Wallach is adequate, about 1/3 of the way in, 2 new characters are introduced and the screeching high pitched wailing he uses for these two characters can not be adequately described. It is horrid! Honestly, shrill doesn't even come close.What in the name of heaven were they thinking when they put this together? I'd love to see this reissued after jailing those responsible for this criminal effort. I want my $$ back!"
2,IT'LL MAKE YOU SLEEP,"I am a big fan of Stephen King's work. This book is very slow, very far-fetched and very boring. Im wont say anything about the storyline youll have to read it."
1,Just plain bad,"I've been a Stephen King fan all my life and this one...well it's a letdown. I read it awhile back and only recall being very disappointed. I finished it because I kept hoping it would get better. For those of you who liked it, you must not have read some of his better work, which is just about anything else he's written thus far. It's comforting that, more often than not, he doesn't let his faithful readers down."
1,Insomnia is the proper title for this book,This is the first Stephen King novel that I have read. If his other works are as bad as this one. Then Insomnia will be my last Stephen King novel.
2,The Man's Worst (Besides Eye Of The Dragon),"If you are like me, and do not even consider ""Eye Of The Dragon"" to be a real Stephan King book, then ""Insomnia"" must truely be his worst. My interest level was minimal throughout, so it took me more than a year to finish. It is simply not a page-turner. Conservatives, stay away from this book; it espouses more feminist dogma than even ""Gerald's Game."""
2,As a long time King fan I was very let down.,"Having really enjoyed Kings books such as The Gunslinger, The Stand, and his masterpiece Misery, I have to say this is one of his weakest books. At 600+ pages I found this book to be a big let down with a less then inspired storey and boring unoriginal characters. Yes it does have a Darktower reference, but it's really nothing important so don't feel you need to read this book for that reason. Besides the Tommyknockers, which is another major King flop, this may be his worst, so my suggestion is to skip it."
4,Esential for understanding the Tower,"I just wanted to say that the people that did not like or understand this book probably have either not read, or didn't like the Dark Tower series. Yes it was long and you have to realize that the entire book was a set up for something very important that will happen later in the Dark Tower series. This book is absolutely essential reading to any fan of the Dark Tower series as it goes more in depth as to the nature of the Tower than even the Dark Tower books do. Everything else in the story is just filler as far as I'm concerned.And remember, all things serve the beam (and all of King's books are tied to the Tower)."
2,Relief is here!,"Perhaps you suffer from insomnia, and this book came up in a random search for books on the topic. If you are truly seeking help with your sleep disorder, do not, I repeat, DO NOT overlook this book merely because it is a work of fiction, and will offer very little in the way of scientific illumination of your problem. Make no mistake about it, if you are an insomniac, this is one book you absolutely MUST have. With few exceptions, the mere act of READING this book offers a more expedient cure than a thousand prescriptions of your pharmacist's most powerful sleeping aid."
2,What a disappointment,"I have long been a King fan, enjoying everything from Carrie to The Stand, The Shining, 'Salem's Lot, Misery, and Desperation. But this book was a real disappointment. Either King is going stale or his editors are afraid to edit him. His old geezer protagonists spout profanity like teenagers and have Baby Boomer sensibilities; completely unbelievable. This would be non-fatal if the story weren't so ridiculous. King usually produces suspense and chills; this thing was more like The Hardy Boys go to The Wizard of Oz. I mean, come on: Not even King can wow me by the introduction of a pair of singing sneakers. Think about it -- singing tennis shoes!!!"
1,"""Insomnia"" put me to sleep","This book was an excruciatingly time-consuming, drawn out and mind-numbing waste of time (SK's and mine). For some reason I pushed myself to finish it. Although it did manage to become somewhat more interesting towards the end the book as a whole was not at all something I would expect from an award winning writer. Don't waste your time or patience."
1,Cure For Insomnia!,"Yes, that's right, if you happen to suffer from insomnia this is the book for you. I got about halfway through it about 9 months ago and it's been sitting on my shelf since then.Besides starting out slow, it becomes almost rediculously comical in the way the characters get more and more outrageous in their behavior. I realize that Stephen King novels are based on the 'make believe' however, I enjoyed most of his other books' eeriness; Insomnia is just crazy and laughable.I recommend skipping this one and going on to one of his other good books like The Shining, Misery, or Christine."
4,A staggering work of imagination.,Well I loved this book. I am scratching my head over some of the reviews. I liked the fact that it wasn't too gory because I'm not really into that. I am always attracted to King's fascinating premises but I am not keen on the gross out factor.This book presents a stunning believable supernatural other world connected to our own. It has an explanation about the way death works.The characters are very believable.Unfortunately the begining and middle are so fantastic that the ending comes as an anticlimax but it is still worth reading.
3,Who's in charge?,"After Ralph's wife Carolyn dies from a brain tumor, Ralph finds he is waking up earlier and earlier each night. He is encountering what some people term ""hyper-reality"" where he sees auras around people and objects, and the world is more colorful. He can tell just from looking at people and their auras what they are thinking, what they are afraid of, etc. A neighbor, Ed Deepneau seems to also have a similar power, but he has aligned himself with the local ""Right to Lifers"" and is becoming increasingly violent and scary. Ralph is even threatened at knifepoint in the public library. Ralph encounters the author's idea of who or what is in charge of when, how and why we die, i.e. the grim reaper. With the help of fellow insomnia-sufferer and newfound love, Lois Chasse, he is charged with saving a little boy from dying before his true time. Some other characters in the book are Helen and Nat Deepneau, Dorrance, Bill McGovern, Clothos, Lachesis, Atropos, the Crimson King, Susan Day."
3,very long,This book took a long time but i just didnt want to give up! it was strange but intresting. 2nd book i read by him. it was okay.
4,"Death, Life, Purpose and Random","This book is and isn't a sequel to 'It', the longest and most sophisticated Derry story, with some similarities, and cross-references. Snip: (...)"
5,I read Insomnia 4 times and I cried at the end each time.,"I haven't read all of King's books, but I have read a lot. Insomnia is definitely my favorite. It's like a familiar movie that you can watch over and over again and not get bored. The colorful ""cartoonish"" characters really make you use your imagination. For those who said it isn't like his other work, ""A good writer varies in content and style to some extent(especially an author of horror stories). If the author writes the same way every time, the stories would get pretty boring and predictable. Maybe you just need to read it again."" :)"
3,Stephen King doesn't disappoint,"Here I am past midnight writing my review of Insomnia....SK creates a world where the main character can see people's pyschadelic auras that surround them...some are good and some are bad. And everyone has a little balloon string like attached from their skull to their aura above their head. But you better watch out because there are little bald doctors that only our hero can see....they are up to no good, they are not of the purpose you see...but of the random. Yes they cut people's ballon string auras...thus killing them. Crazy as all this sounds, this was a cool book and fun to read as most all of King's books are no matter what professors of literature may say about it!"
4,Good.,"This wasn't one of King's best books- it was a bit, well, strange at some parts. For instane, Bald Doctors. But it was an interesting book- maybe a bit slow in some parts, though. Quite a lot of characters too. But I still read through it and found it hard to put it down most times. I found it interesting with the Auras and Balloon Strings. I would recommend this to Stephen King fans but be prepared for a long and sometimes confusing book!"
1,boooooring!,"This book took me three (3) years to finish reading. Need I say more? Boring, dragged on and on and on and on and on.........................................."
1,"I can't find the ""zero"" option for rating.","This book is completely awful. How many pages of pure garbage do you have to cut through to get to the main point? It doesn't matter, there is no point! For starters, this book is NOT a horror novel. It should be in the childrens section of the bookstore, next to ""Superfudge"" and other simplistic, shallow, 3rd grade reading levels! How about the three hundred times those stupid little freaks had to look at eachother ""with concern?"" Did you like that? PLEASE don't attempt to read this book."
4,This book drags you in and holds you there.,"I love Stephen King's books. This book was one I did not think I would like until I started it. The booked grabbed a hold of me and I could hardly put it down the week it took me to read it. What I liked was the supernatural religious presence, heroes being real people, especially those on in years, and the reassuring view of death. The ending of the book was sad but not pointless. I knew deep down what would happen to Ralph but hoped it wouldn't. The ending pulled heart strings that made tears come to my eyes"
2,DRAGS ON LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.,"I CAN'T SAY I HAD AS MUCH FUN WITH THIS BOOK AS I DID WITH IT. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT TRIES TO COPY A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR PREMISE, BUT IT IS JUST TOO BORING. READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE READ NO OTHER STEPHEN KING BOOKS. QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT"
5,FANTASTIC,"INSOMNIA is one of King's best works. This story take the reader through several emotions: terror, with DR. #3; sadness, with the toture of the dog; joy, at besting the plans of the Crimson King and satisfaction that all ends well. I think this book, in particular, gives some insight into some of King's theories on various subjects.For example, his ideas on where items go when they are lost and never found (DR. 3, under the tree). Also, his feelings on stages of death and afterlife(colored auras, cutting the string). And planes of existence (there are other worlds than ours). I have always enjoyed reading King and being able to peek into his psyche."
3,It wasn't the best book he ever wrote.,"I just finished reading this and would to say ""It cured my Insomnia"". It was long, and drawn out. I collect Stephen King's books and in fact have over 35of his hard cover books. This one will sit on the shelf with the others but it will be along time before it comes down."
2,It just aint that good.,"Stephen King's Insomnia is not his best book. It's not his worst either, it just aint that good. For one thing, IT'S TO DAMN LONG. I mean, instead of getting right to the point, King goes off on these long monolouges about what the weather is like and what colored shirt someone is wearing. I really don't care, get to the point. But I will defend the book in one aspect: People have been saying that the book is to far-fetched. C'mon, honsetly, when did Stephen King ever write anything that was realistic."
4,A favorite of the fantasy reader.,"For the fantasy reader, Insomnia is one of the best books you will ever read. It combines King's modern day experiences and his indescribable talent for fantasy. Like most King books, there is some graphic and sexual content. This, however, manages to enhance the experience and make the book more enjoyable. Story is original and fairly easy to read. Plot is impossible to describe without quoting most of the book."
2,Slower than my grandma!!,"I love Stephen King. But, I was so hyped on getting this book, then when I read it, I wanted to scream. The story was really nice, but 700 some odd pages is too long for such a boring book. It was too much fantasy for my taste. (Not to say that he has to make everything believable) If you people read my reviews and keep wondering why I down his books so much, it is because King rocks, and I don't want people to read stuff that doesn't help his image any."
3,"Not the greatest, but OK","I liked this book, and the characters in it, but it just went on for far too long. He should have made it into a 400 page book instead. I got very bored with this book towards the middle."
2,This is the first Stephen King book that I couldn't finish.,"I tried. I really did. This book just couldn't hold my interest. I read about half of it and gave up. Read The Green Mile, Hearts in Atlantis, It, Carrie, or any other King book before you read this one!"
1,Frank Tibbetts,"The first question that comes to my mind after reading this book is: ""What were you thinking when you wrote this, Stephen?"" I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did.I felt that after several hundred pages of hallucinations, the author got bored of writing this and slapped ""THE END"" on the last page. The only ""horror"" I saw in this book was the mental picture of seventy-year olds having sex. I know it happens, but for Pete's sake, that scarred my delicate psyche for eternity. I am so glad I bought this book at a flea market. Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and I have almost all of his books in my library, but if anyone is thinking of reading Insomnia, then this novel will be the cure for it."
2,Great Start goes flat...,"What a great introduction to the idea that an old man has got the 'gift' and can see people who are loosing their souls...... just goes banal just more than half way through to the point where you need to be a Dark Tower fan, big time, to like it. If you read Black House and liked that (because you are a Dark Tower series fan, and you read The Talisman) then Insominia has all that some other-worldy stuff that isn't really every King fan's cup of tea."
1,People With Insomnia Only Ones Able to Finish This Book!,"I tried, I really, really tried. This is not only the first King book I couldn't finish, but the only book EVER I haven't finished. Reason? I didn't CARE what happened. I didn't CARE what became of the characters, so I never wondered. In most books, (IT, Carrie, Bag of Bones or Koontz's Watchers, Phantoms) I wanted to know what would happen. I cared and felt like I was a part of their lives. Not in this one! This book might actually have been written as a cure for insomnia! Put me right to sleep!"
1,"Preachy, pretentious, political propaganda","If you like political diatribes disguised as ""fiction"", this book is for you. If you think pro-choice Lesbians are all unsung heroes and pro-life activists are all raving, wife beating control freaks, this book is for you. If you want to slog through hundreds of pages of ""Goodliness is admirable but Godliness is vile"", then this book is for you. If you are an ""openminded"" liberal who believes that perpetuating ugly stereotypes about conservatives is an honorable mission, then you have hit paydirt.If, however, you were expecting a book with interesting characters, intriguing situations and thoughtful contemplation of different ideas and motivations, then skip this and try something else. This book is an insult to serious readers and a 600+ page tribute to smug, self congratulating humanists.Before purchasing, you might want to sleep on it."
2,READING INSOMNIA HELPED ME FALL ASLEEP,I respect most of Stephen Kings work but I did not enjoy reading Insomnia. He draged the story along with a few good ideas but for the most part it was a chore to read. In my opinion one bad point that stood out the most was that there were too many liberal minded characters voicing their opinion when it was really unecessary. It looked to me like Mr. King was using his story to get certain political beliefs into the minds of his readers. Another annoying apect of the book was how trite the characters dialouge could be at times. There were a lot of predictable moments that spoiled the little suspense the novel offered.One highlight of the book was at the end of the story when the main character (his name slips my mind) faces one of the best villians ever emagined. Taking this into consideration I gave this book 2 stars.
1,Waste of time and money. too political,"This book was just another addition to King's political rants that he wastes too many pages preaching instead of building a good story. I have lost faith in King, I did enjoy many of his past work, but with this and many others it really belongs in the political section and not the horror section."
1,is there a point to this endless book?,The book goes on and on endlessly. I usually don't have an issue with profanity and cursing but this book seems to have an abundance of it with no particular point. Also some of the abortion discussion is overly descriptive. All this and no story. King can't be counted on to provide a good story.
1,Stephen's worst book!,"This is his most boring book, I couldn't finish it. Every character has a childish mind and behavior. Stephen wrote this book just thinking about how would it look like on the screen, with the visual efects. I recomend this book to children between 12-15. Don't waste your time/money with Insomnia, only if you ARE with insomnia: you'll always sleep like a log after 20 pages!"
1,Hours of my life wasted on this...,"Crap, crap, crap, crap! I love King, but had to drag myself through this uninteresting story. I made myself finish it because I had faith Uncle Stevie (King that is) would reward the reader in the end. Boy was I wrong! Look to his earlier stuff for a good read, this book's a real nightmare! PS- Did I mention it's crap?!!"
2,"Steve, what happened?","I've loved every single Stephen King book I've read - except for this one. It stinks! I can't understand what happened - how can such a talented writer produce such a bomb?It's just *dull*. You'll just be waiting for it to end. If you have not read any King, do not choose this one. Anything else he has written is better."
2,to many errors in type,"I love Stephen King novels. This Kindle edition has serious errors throughout the book. I read page after page with errors, it was getting annoying after awhile.Not simple mis spellings, but incorect words.The town is Derry, at one point the name is Deny.The word me where the word obviously was meant to be the.Corndor for corridor.Then instead of the, that one I forgive.My problelm that there are so many errors throughout the book, most are in the first quarter through middle of the book. It was just annoying to read.Generally the errors are the incorrect word than mis spellings. I'm not trying to be an editor, this is just bad proof reading if any proofing was done at all.If a book is going to be released this way for Kindle I feel that 6.99 is too much to pay. I think a partial refund is in order.I like the story, maybe not as much as other of King's stories, but still I enjoyed the ride."
5,You can't stop listening. . .,"Ralph Robert is a character you will worry about and cheer for, as Eli Wallach splendidly takes you through this spine-tingling tale. There is a world that very few can see, and King will have you suffering from insomnia as you listen and await the outcome of Ralph's adventure."
3,Enjoyable but took a while to get going.,"Ok, so I did enjoy this book but it took forever to get going. The beginning was very slow and had a large political aspect about it. Once it got going my interest peaked and I flew through the ending. There are several aspects of the book that you need to pay attention to while reading, one of which is the tie in to his Dark Tower series. Had I not know about the connection I would have missed it. Insomnia was a good book but I don't feel it lived up to Stephen King Standards."
4,Insomnia: Twisting the boundaries between dream and reality,"Stephen King's novel Insomnia is a ""colorful"" and gripping tale that has readers wondering what will come next. Ralph Roberts and his lady friend go on slightly lengthy journey into the limits of reality to help save their town of Derry, Maine. During the spell of torturing insomnia, Ralph and his friend must deal with Purpose, life, death, and Random in order to bring sanity back into their crazy lives. Although a little slow in the beginning and end, this story will keep you turning pages and thanking Stephen King for his brilliance."
3,Stephen King is more the king of weird.,"His books are hypothetically terrifying concepts, but for the most part, I think a lot of his books are just down right weird. It's good for a weird story, but I don't think it's scary. This book is among his weirdest. One observation I would like to make is that Derry, Main is the fictitious town where ""It' occurred a number of years earlier."
3,Beautiful limited edition for the King collector,"This review relates to the limited edition from Mark Ziesing.This version of the book is definitely worth investing in. The oversized book comes in a beautiful slipcase. The book itself is printed on heavy paperstock, has a smythsewn binding(for a lot longer durability) and contains severel color illustrations by Phil Hale. The book is not signed, but who cares, when everything else is topnotch!!! The 3 stars are given for the story which is not SK's best. Should i only rate the production of the book, it would get 5 stars!!!!"
2,Not his best.,"Long, drawn out, and at times plain boring, this ranks as one of the very few King books I've regretted buying. It's not horror, suspence, drama... anything that you would typically look for in a King book can't be found in this, other than a handful of quasi-interesting characters."
2,not one of his best,"The idea behind the story is clever and ripe with possibilities, but this book just doesn't work. The biggest problem is, at 650 pages, it is way, way too long and at some points utterly dull. Just when you think you've hit the meat of the story, it meanders away like a lost dog.There are large chunks of boring exposition and bad dialogue and when you finally do start to find out what's going on, it gets repetitive. I'm a big King fan and think he's an incredible writer but this was a misfire."
4,Fairly Good Book,"This book was good in my opinion and not exactly boring; just a little ""slow"" in some parts. The portrayal of anti-abortionists was disagreeable to me and the characters were a little flat, but if you like fantasy then you will probably find this book enjoyable. Idiots (people who don't want to think, I'm very blunt and insensitive.) should not read this book."
3,way to long for the story it told.,You ever notice that old people think the world revolves around them. They move as slow as they want. This is what insomnia does. The plot doesn't really get going until about 400 pages. I kept at it for the tie in to the Dark Tower. The book was okay but could have been about 200 less pages.
2,"A great idea, badly executed","This started out as great read, it was more spooky than scary and it kept you guessing and trying to pick up hints and clues. The story was awesome - guy who can't sleep starts seeing wierd stuff and travels to other 'levels'.However, it all fell apart. Firstly, it dragged on way too long. Secondly, the moment I found out the little bald men were good guys my interest level dropped. And third, the ending got so predictable it was a joke.The first half or so was fantastic, the second half was plain boring. All in all, a great idea - badly executed."
3,"A good book, though it drags on","I liked this book quite a bit but I didn't give a higher rating because it kind of drags on. I recomend this to all Sci-Fi fans especially, and SK fans also. Though it was a little to Sci-Fi for me but I still liked it. Don't let this one be your first SK book but read after you've read a few other SK books."
3,Unlike King.,This is a halfway decent book but it is probably the worst King book that I have read. The other king books that I have read have been very attention grabbing and good. But this one is rather boring. It is not recomended
4,won't put you to sleep,"a man is tormented by insomnia. some anti-abortion movement seem to be growing. the man starts seeing things. becoming aware of other things. something is about to happen. an enemy having no part in nature is making its move. something needs help. but what's the plan of this enemy? the plot here is great, SK's writing style professional, and the descriptions are among his very best. a lot of suspence. some very good details. interesting plot. carries out nicely."
2,An overly long disappointment,"As usual, the writing is stellar in INSOMNIA, but the quality of the writing isn't enough of a reason to wade through a book with a modest premise that's basically overwritten and padded everywhere it can be padded. King's basic weakness as a writer is that he provides the reader with EVERY thought the protagonist has at EVERY turn of the story. This pushes what could have been a basically sound story at maybe 350 pages to an almost 700 overly-packed monster. King is better when he is working short and concise, as in FIRESTARTER, DEAD ZONE, and the stories in FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT. Only die-hard fans of King will like this book. But for me, I ended up skimming the last half. And I _hate_ doing that. I like to honor the words writers write, but I don't like writers who are thieves of time--_my_ time."
4,"Long, but interesting!","Ralph Roberts is a regular guy, except he has insomnia, following the slow death of his beloved wife. After a long time (with plenty of sleepless nights)he begins to see auras around people. Most are healthy looking, others look sickly and deadly. Without knowing it, he has messed in with ""long-time business"" and is now expected to save over 2,000 pro-abortion protesters from the nice chemist who used to live down the street from him, before he turned into a crazy wife-beater, by two mystical creatures, named Clotho and Lachesis. But the evil 3rd of the creatures, named Atropos (they are named after the Greek mythology characters the Fates)is doing everything to keep Ralph and his ""lady-friend"", Lois Chasse away from saving the protesters from Ed Deepneau... and his plane loaded with explosives. Once many of the lives are saved, Lois and Ralph are married and live happily until Atropos makes another appearance... and causes the sad, yet refreshing, ending"
5,Another in the field of page-turning excellence!!,"What a switch from the usual Stephen King masterpiece! I was enthralled with the insight into characters and the lack of their morality. Definitely not a slow read, I finished it in one day, unable to put it down. This is a definite must read for any horror novel fan!!!"
2,King's book is a sure cure,"Having been a Stephen King fan for years, I have had the pleasure of witnessing his evolution from a writer of blatant horror stories to a chronicler of the struggle between good and evil. With Insomnia, King seems to have become stuck in a rut, albeit a prolific one. The formula for this book is a thinly veiled alteration of the same theme that has predominated King's recent overlength works. Unfortunately, even after sifting through the fluff and surviving the first several hundred pages, the end of the journey provided no rewards. Is this rut merely King's manifestation of writer's block? Will we be able to stay awake through his next work long enough to get an answer"
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","May be King had a contract to respect. The idea was not bad, the slowly beginning is very involving, U feel sleep but U can't sleep. Stop to read when Ed sees the ""doctors"" coming out from neighbour's door.If U want it, buy the inexpensive version.It's not a too hard response ( I think King is one of the best writers of the world, but he can misspell too)"
1,AWFUL! STAY AWAY!,"First off, I'm a big ol King fan, dont get me wrong. I had high high hopes for this book. I mean, judging from what the description on back said, it sounded way cool! So I went to the library and got the big ol hardcover edition that was just HUGE! Well, I got about, oh, one or two hundred pages into it and it just got so, ""Blah!"". It was boring, and just went no where.. Now, some of the descriptions of the scissor dudes and the auras, that was ok. But it just did NOT keep me interested.. I read it all the way through. It was torture. It just did not work at all. I was so thankful I got it from the library and didnt waste MY money on it. Please, I advise you to do the same or! : JUST SAY NO! :o) Youve been warned! Go get Desperation or The Green Mile!"
1,This novel was thoroughly disappointing.,"I have never before read a Stephen King book that I didn't enjoy. This one, however, was a struggle to read and a bigdisappointment. While usually I read one of King's novels in a few days, this one took me weeks to finish."
3,Decent read,"We all know that not everyone can do 100% all the time, and this book is a indication. It's not as scary as some of his other books, and I found it plodding in a few places. If you're a SK enthusiast, you may enjoy this book. I did, just don't expect a great read. It's more of a 'light' read, at least to me, and is something that one would enjoy in the waiting room or on an airplane. If you're not already into Stephen King, this book might not be for you. Try 'Christine' or 'It' instead."
3,An OK book at best,"I read Insomnia because it is tied in to the Dark Tower series, which I love. I really disliked the characters in Insomnia, especially Ralph. I don't know why, but by the end of the book I really didn't care if he died or not. Not King's best work."
5,Loved it but I have so many unanswered questions,I have listened to the unabridged audio read by Eli Wallach 6 times. I keep finding more answers and more questions. I wish there was a companion to this novel delving more into what was going on with the other insomniacs besides Ralph. What was Ed doing and how did Lois cope and Joe ? I still am disappointed in the Crimson King I wanted a bit more of a payoff after almost 15 hours of listening. I would love to correspond with others that found bits and pieces worth passing on ..
2,Should be subtitled old people can be heros to.,"Honestly, I think Stephen King ran out of ideas here. This has so many references to his other books it could be called a compilation. Not to mention the fact this suffers from the all to frequent problems King problem of confused endings.I am an avid King fan but was let down by this tale. If you are new to King start with Bag of Bones not this one it is likely to turn you off to King. I gave it two stars because while there are a lot of borrowed ideas from other books there are some orignal ideas here. I wish King had expanded on those ideas more instead of using the recycling bin."
3,Great except for the gratuitous swearing,Stephen King is certainly a brilliant story teller but why does a man of his talents always resort to cliched foul language and blasphemy? I do not find that aspect entertaining.
2,Easily his worst,"If this had come from a new, no-name author, no publisher would have touched it. The story is ridiculous and utterly unconvincing; I liked the idea of an elderly protagonist, but other than that the novel was simply boring. I'm a big fan of King's earlier novels, but the books he wrote in the 90s have been just one disappointment after the other, and this one takes the cake. Please Mr King, even if you are THE bestest-selling author around, PLEASE let someone edit your books. Do your fans a favor and give them readable, enjoyable books. And how about putting some heart back into your stories? They need a little breath of fresh air, and so do your readers."
3,A very long book containing 787 pages,This was not one of King's best book's it was Ok but kind of boring. I probably wouldn't reomend this unless you like swears every couple seconds and you can sit down and really read becaus you have to pay attention.
4,Awsome,"This book was great. I actually thought that I knew Ralph and Lois. I knew something was bound to happen with them since they were flittering so much through the whole book practically. Ralph was a really cool guy, and it's too bad that we don't have very many people like him in the world today."
4,Courteously awaiting dawn shines the path of fear,"S. King reveals here what makes him one of the most endearing and irritating author of the modern era. On one hand his tendency to overdo the pop culture references, blood is never red but is ""red as the coke cartoon cups from mcdonalds"". This same quality paradoxically makes reading this novel feel like wearing an old pair of sneakers to check out anoise under the stairs, you're comfy and you know what is that you'll find under the stairs, but there's still the curiosity to go down there and check it out ""just in case"""
2,It will definitely cure,"....your insomnia. lots of people are saying that the first 200 pages are the hardest to get through. I found them to be the best part of the book. .... If you have insomnia, look no further....couple hundred pages and you will be cured"
2,Will not keep you up at night,"""Insomnia"" is a negative example of the problems with later period Stephen King novels. A passibly scary story idea worthy of perhaps a novella length treatment in a ""Four Past Midnight"" type collection, instead stretched out for seven or eight hundred pages until as a reader insomnia is one of the last of your problems. Once again, King creates a decent setup that loses effectiveness as many pages crawl by with little or no action. This is not one of his best or in the end even all that scary."
2,My first King book is extremely disappointing!!,"This was my first King book and I must say that it was awful. I'm not giving up on him because I know that he must be good given all the praise he has received and the great movies that have come about from his work. However, this book was so ridiculous, just cookie cutter material that provided no real feelings and I found myself reading it just to finish it, hoping for an improvement on the next page, chapter or part. The only reason that people have rated it so well is...well I have no clue, unless they're die-hard fans just giving all his work 5 stars. Ridiculous. Don't bother. I'm just 40 pages into The Shining I can tell it will be much better."
1,Ripoff,When I bought it their wasn't anything mentioned about it being on casset tapes. So I can't listen to it untill I can find a tape player.
1,"A dedicated King fan says ""the worst""","Are you a King fan, but disliked Tommyknockers? If so, I bet you'll dislike this one as well. It has all of the same problems ... cartoonish characters and protagonists, made-for-the-movie- screen cliches ... the multiple-dimension universe idea was standard and weakly developed, and this book really had nothing else going for it ... I mean, little doctors who snip lifeline strings; singing tennis shoes?Here is my theory: this was another of King's tests of his readers, like the Bachman books. Either he got someone else to (poorly) write a Stephen-King-like book, or he intentionally wrote a bad book, to see if his fans would still snap it up."
2,Enough already!,"Why waste words? King's Insomnia wasted enough already. If you're an incurable King fan, and will read anything he dishes out, then go ahead and buy it. Just be aware that this book is an agenda with a weak plot wrapped around it. Not since ""Tommyknockers"" has King been so thoroughly absorbed in peddling his tired liberal slop."
2,Disappointing as hell,"The generalizations that King makes toward the pro life movement stinks. He characterizes all pro-lifers as evil and insane, while making all others angelic. Gimme a break King, leave your politics out of your books. Aside from that, the allusions to the dark tower themes were well placed. An otherwise intesteting book packed with worn out political issues."
2,Have to bring that rating down,"I wasn't going to review this thing -- wasn't worth the effort. But then I saw it averaged three-and-a-half stars and thought I should do my part to bring that down, and to warn potential buyers. Don't get me wrong about Stephen King: Some of his books have brought me more enjoyment than those of any other author. But certainly not this one. King has tried here to get inside the heads of senior citizens and fails miserably; his characters seem to be some 13-year-old boy's idea of what ""cool"" geezers might be like. When King is at his best (read Misery), he goes light on the supernatural and heavy on the realistic suspense. When he's at his worst (read this one) he has cartoon characters spouting (literally) cartoon balloons above their heads. Did Cujo scare you? How about Carrie? Me, too. But hey, wait until you meet up with King's singing tennis shoes in this piece of junk -- sounds scary, doesn't it? Not."
5,Better than the others,"I have read them all...Larry williams,Scott Slutsky, etc. and they don't come close to these guys. Their common sense in terms of understanding the basics of analysis and coming to terms with yourself is invaluable. They do traders a favor by asking them to look at yourself and decide whether you are cut out to be a trader and if so what type. If you are not who you think you are then their advice to do something else is a breath of fresh air."
4,"Clothes, memory and emotions","This is a linked set of essays by a former writer for Vogue and other UK magazines and newspapers.We gradually learn much of the writer's personal history, refracted through clothes worn by herself, her family and others.I found it a moving and beautifully written meditation on the power of clothes to stimulate our curiosity, rouse our memories and comfort us."
5,The definitive book on the subject,"I will be honest here and say that I have waded through waves of ineffectual verbiage on the subject of otherness in the Middle Ages. Most of the writing on alterity in the medieval period is pure dreck, with the notable exception of Jeffrey J. Cohen's, Fradenburg's, and D. Vance Smith's work. Uebel's masterly book joins their company, and issues what is the defining statement on the sociopsychological uses to which otherness was put. I will be using this book in my classes, but more importantly, I shall be returning to it again and again for a catalyst for my own writing on the subject. This book is indispensable. As a footnote, does anyone know how I can reach the author?"
2,These songs are not from the movie,"I felt a bit suckered after buying this album. I loved the movie, and was moved by the music (and I'm not a religious guy). But these aren't the hard-core gospel songs in the flick. Instead they're more professional covers done by bigger names. As a result, they lack a lot of the heart of soul of the songs in the movie. I guess my problem is I can't find the ""old-school"" gospel that was featured in the movie. It's such a shame that a movie that was so un-traditional (in a movie sense) didn't have the cajones to release the songs that were actually in the film."
4,"""Praise the Lord and Pass the Plate!""","I have yet to see the movie in its entirety but after hearing Lyle Lovett over the closing credits, I had to buy the CD. Lovett's ""I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord"" is a foot-stomping, hand-clapping, good old-fashioned Sunday-go-to-meeting jam that works!The album is filled with traditional Southern gospel, interpreted by artists that truly understand the power of music to express one's faith.Other highlight's include the familiar ""Softly and Tenderly"" (Rebecca Lynn Howard), a spiritually evocative ""In the Garden"" by Johnny Cash, Lori White's ""There is Power in the Blood"", Sounds of Blackness' soulfully a cappella version of ""Victory of Mine"", the funeral favorite ""I'll Fly Away"", done by Gary Chapman and Wynonna.Star Robert Duvall shows his vocal talents, along with Emmylou Harris, on the harmonically satisfying ""I Love to Tell the Story"".It's music like this that makes one long for the ""little church by the side of the road""."
5,As wonderful as I remembered!,"I saw ""The Apostle"" years ago and remembered its soundtrack to be filled with rousing gospel, songs which were hard to find individually, so I ordered the CD and have been singing along since it arrived. It wasn't easy to track down and I can't figure out why - it's such a winner! Of course I got it at Amazon - Itunes didn't have it (although they did have one of the singles, ""I'll Fly Away"")."
1,My money back!,"The dynamic range, both pianist and orchestra is from loud to noise, there's no piano and nothing in between. Pianist is harsh and I was amazed to see that the orchestra tries to follow him in that pathetic noise making.Barber's music is killed in this ""performance"", the rhythmical figures are completely disstorted and there's clear that pianist and orchestra are almost never together, they're both guessing.I think that Naxos in general in order to make those cheap recordings, ended up making really CHEAP recordings. I thought that they wanted all these masterpieces to be accessible to music fans, but this way, it will be no music fans pretty soon. I hate the way that Barber sounds here, and if I didn't know who is Barber and what he wrote, I will never want to hear his music again.In my case, please, give me my money back! NOW!"
1,Tangering rip off,"What a joke! The movie used pretty much the same footage as Tanner Hall's Believe movie. I just wasted $20! Don't get this movie. No story, no plot, just a bunch of losers bumming around. The music sucks and the clips are poor versions of ""Believe"" - this is the movie you should really buy if you are into deep powder and xtreem skiing."
2,The Best? Not really.,"I'd hardly call this collection ""The Best"". I fell for a marketing ploy. It's a collection of middle-quality songs by popular British Folk Rock bands of the last few decades, such as Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention. A better option: just buy the original recordings, and don't fall for this set, unless you know exactly what you're getting."
3,Simple but Useful Intercom System,"The system is very simple but allows all the features it advertises. If you just want to be able to call out to another level of your home or answer the door, this is for you."
3,Online Description is False: NO CLOSED CAPTIONING,"I re-ordered this dvd to see if A & E had added the closed captioning, as it is described on Amazon as having CC. It does NOT. Such a shame. The info/visuals/survivors/eye witnesses' accounts are superb, but so many of my students will have no idea what the eye witnesses are saying. Many of our students are not that fluent in English so when you add the VERY heavy Russian accents, the impact of what the survivors are saying gets lost. I am returning the video."
1,Poor Stalin biography,"I was expecting a more complete biography. It is difficult to understand the english spoken by russian experts due to their heavy accent, and yet there was no display of what they were saying (captions). No translation either. I was expecting a lot more from an A&E dvd biography."
4,A Brief Introduction to the Life of an Anti-Christ,"This video serves well the casual viewer who is looking for a quick introduction to the life of this monster. The interviews that put Stalin into an historical context are quite interesting, especially those with Condoleezza Rice, a renowned Kremlinologist before becoming National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush."
4,Great for on the go!,"I needed one really bad for my car and found this works great for my RAZR. There are a lot of chargers out there, and you really can't go wrong with this item. Does the job and I'm pretty satisfied. Ready to pick up another one for my truck!"
1,Never listened to it!,When i purchased this cd i thought it was all the original artist! And it's not! It's by a group called ( the league of decency) No disrespect to the group but i never played the cd.
2,Not worth the money,"I actually purchased this for around $22 on[...]. It had 11 episodes, but I wasn't that impressed with it, so I threw it away after watching it. At least I didn't pay a lot for it at [...]. Most of the information is antiquated and I didn't learn a whole lot."
3,Don't believe the title,"Robotics, Mechatronics and Artificial Intelligence may be an odd title for this book, as, while most of the circuit blocks are certainly usable in robotics, there are very few where a robot would be the primary use. There are circuits for anything from Touch Lamps and Light Dimmers through to the more robotic circuits like the particularly good chapter on H-Bridges. There are blocks which cover a good number of uses in robotics and mechatronics, but I don't know exactly where he gets the AI bit of his title.One thing the title got exactly right though was 'Experimental Ciruit Blocks'. There were a number of errors in type but, more importantly if you're using this book as a reference, the schematics. Things like in the ""how to use transistors"" chapter he more than once mixes his PNP and NPN transistors. Nearly all of the blocks are fine, just keep on your toes."
3,Nice concept,The entire easel and these kits never took off. We keep it all in the family room and just hope it will take off with the kids.
4,Good Learning toy but Poor quality,The product was good.It is a good learing toy for my kids. They love it it has a little over everything in it. Really it's great for the younger to the much older kids as my older kids love playing it with the younger kids.It is cheaply made though
2,Look how far we've come!,"Due to the dated nature of the material, not really useful for those engaged in current research. Historically significant to those of us who work in this engrossing area of cell biology."
1,IT'S A KIT!!!,"Though it is not stated in the description, this is a kit.It's going back.It also will not generate a single pulse, just a stream of pulses."
1,A totally useless book. One wonders why it was written.,"Some factual errors that I'm aware of- Tesla was not born in Serbia, but Croatia, although he was a Serb. Also, some of the traits attributable to his so-called geniuses, are prevalent in a great part of our society. In short, the book overreaches and in a word, is inane. It proves nothing about the the minds of his purported geniuses, of many which most people never heard of. The book isn't worth the money which I paid for it at a discount store."
3,Would have been a fun read without the opinions.,"Overall the book was about Tesla with brief references to the scat others the author knew of and admired. Dr. Pickford wrote from the romantic assumption that eccentricity was somehow tolerated during earlier times and that geniuses of today are being suppressed due to societal intolerances. He seems to ignore that except for those geniuses that became hermits, the other members of his Strange Brain Club for Men were wealthy or had wealth in their upbringing. As enjoyable as the book is for the most part, I find this narrow approach to strange brains and genius rather limited. It should have been titled ""Eccentric Upper Class Men."""
2,GOOD BUT LOST INTEREST AFTER AWHILE,"I liked this book in the beginning but some of the chapters were longer than others, and the facts were interesting but it was also very disturbing in some parts. I lost interest in it after awhile. Definitely a different book. I would rate it 2.5 to 3 stars. I think that each of the scientists deserved the same amount of recognition. There was only one madman in there Ted Kaczynski who shouldn't have been in there. The book would have been better if it was just about scientists."
2,Raining on the parade: author is instrusive and tiresome,"After a friend reacted to the book in the exact same way as me, I decided to pass this along. Subject matter is hugely interesting, but Pickover seems most interested in himself, in his cutesy writing style, in showing off unnecessarily grandiloquent vocabulary, in categorizing and putting in boxes.... in fact, the ""subjects"" were treated just that way, as subjects. How interesting if someone like Dr. Oliver Sacks, who is interested in their humanity, might treat these folk at the far end of the continuum of human behavior. I couldn't even finish Pickover's treatment."
4,Strange!,"This book is full of highly interesting stories. Some are a little disturbing. I always have found the topic of eccentrics and geniuses to be interesting, and this book is the best on the subject. I've just recently been introduced to Cliff's books, and I personally think he isn't the greatest writer or anything, but he definetly knows his stuff and proposes topics in a way that challenges and intrigues the reader."
2,"Interesting idea, poorly executed","This book isn't bad as a starting point; if you want to learn about some interesting and ingenious eccentrics, it will steer you in the right direction. But his research is really weak -- some chapters are drawn almost whole from a single source (e.g. his chapter on Pyke) -- and Pickover's writing style can be clumsy at times. There is no serious attempt explain what real connection there is, if any, between madness and genius. Fortunately, the people he's discussing are interesting enough that even the author's fumbles don't keep the book from being fairly entertaining.Pickover has the makings of a better book here, and I can only hope that someday he will get a decent editor -- and maybe a new library card -- to deepen and refine it."
4,A fine line between insanity and genius,"Damn interesting book. It is filled with detailed history and funny anecdotes about our most cherished famous inventors. After reading about Tesla and his fellow peers, I do not think I would want to be as intelligent as these guys. Come on guys, would you like to run around and be known as the ""weirdo"" who lives down the block? Makes for interesting reading and it is a fascinating journey into the minds of the world's most famous geniuses. It is almost like taking a trip into a mad, mad, mad world. The minds of these guys are just out this world. Highly recommended reading."
5,An intellectual adventure,"This book is a treasure chest of learning and insight -- an intellectual adventure. It's scope is vast -- as Pickover takes us from genius to the very brink of madness. He does not shy away from controversy as he races through religion, modern art, rogue physics, IQ and heredity and odd sexual compulsions. My favorite chapters are: ""Where on Earth is Einstein's Brain?"" and ""Do We Really Use Only 10% of our Brains?"" Pickover has outdone himsel! I anxiously await a sequel."
4,Sweet tale as all Cartland's are,"Unusual that in this story the Duke of Tynmouth was not all that nice. I didn't think I would ever warm up to him but the sweet Honora shows him that women can be loving, intelligent and caring (and not just in bed). The Duke was spoiled by all the adulation that men and women sent his way and meeting an unspoiled, unimpressed young woman threw him. The villianous Aunt Ailene was an intriguing character who eventually got her due.A quick fun read. I love to read a Cartland for a quick uplifting story."
2,Hypertech Corvette engin tuner,Product came very fast like all Amazon Prime products I've ordered. Worked one time with guages then wouldn't let me do anything. I got an error code iirc 102 but haven't had time to try to resolve the problem. If I can't fix it in a couple days I'll ship it back for a refund.
3,Tumbler,Tumbler came with two broken retainer washers so I havent been able to use yet. Went to hardware store for new ones and havent gotten the right size . Other that the motor runs and everything else seems OK
3,Tumbler,This product works as advertised; however there were no instructions provided with it. I missed getting one of the nylon coverings put on right and damaged one of the roller rods. It would have been nice to have a note put on line that stated the tumbler did not come with grit or polish. A better idea would have been to include a small amount with the product so one did not have to waif to use it.
2,disappointed,"It is kind of deceiving in the ad as the cartridge is pictured in a box and looks new. The adcalls them NEW. However when said items (I ordered 2 of them) arrived in mail,they are enclosed only in cellophane. There is no box and they appear to be old stock.One of the cartridges says 2006 and the other 2010. I am not sure if these are cartridges thathave been refilled or why they have old dates and are not in a box. I have not tried using them as my currentink cartridges are not empty yet. I will be very interested to see how they work."
1,HP 14 Black or Tri-Color ink Cartridge's,Almost all #14 HP ink cartridges are expired. Even if they are new or re-manufactured. HP does notmanufacture any more of this HP 14 cartridge. They will not work in a HP Color Inkjet CP 1160 printer.The LED screen keeps flashing and you get the hourglass symbol indicating that the cartridgehas expired. The only way I was able to get the cartridge to work in my printer was to unplug the printerthen remove the CMOS battery from the printer and let it sit for about 20 minutes then plug it back inwithout the CMOS battery and the cartridge worked ok.
1,Out of date,This product was several years out of date and was dried out. It would not work.A reimbursement was requested and given.
1,Was sent out dated #14 Ink cartridge.,"When I went to put #14 Ink cartridge in printer it said ""out dated put in new cartridge"" so I looked at it & it was dated........3/9/06. Was needed to print out a quote for one of my customer.......grrrrrr!!"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!,"I love the CD and I especially love ""BACK IN THE SADDLE"". Matraca is definetly a top star!"
1,Utterly Offesive!!!,"I am an atheist and I accidently saw this offensive audio cassette. I am an atheist, and this tape is just religious anti atheist rhetoric. Atheism is only for those who can think for themselves. Atheism is for those who do not wish to be controlled, guilted, or otherwise forced to do something bacuase other want to impose their beliefs on us. Atheists are critical thinkers, theists just accept everythinng as it is ""because gawd will it"". This tape is just bad politics and lies. Do not be decieved!"
1,"Too much soup, very little meat","Great tittle poor delivery. It seems like a self advertising self referential book full of ""old pa'"" stories. Very little stuff new -if any really- and practically no real insight for the ""clicks"" part of the equation. I was very disappointed. The issue of ""culture"" needs a much more profound approach and certainly needs some support on theory which does not exist."
1,"Execpt for Internet-ignorant newbies, a waste of 20 bucks","As an experienced manufacturing executive who recently joined a b2b ""clicks and mortar"" firm, I was excited to find this book, particularly once I saw that the Schwab guy co-wrote it (the other guy is completely a coattail writer who adds zero value with his chapter begginning and ending comments....he seems oddly thrown into this book, for what reason i cannot figure out.....must be a golfing buddy of the Schwab guy.)This book has an Internet title, an Internet subtitle, hence my purchase. However, aside from the 6 or so pages about how Schwab battled with channel conflict, cannibalization issues, it is A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. It should have been titled, ""I can't write, don't have much to say, but I run a big company, so pay me Twenty bucks and maybe my luck will rub off on you."""
4,Not really an Internet book,"The title on this book is a bit of a misnomer -- this isn't really an Internet business book. The book's focus is on building a sustainable, healthy corporate culture. While it's not an Internet book per se, some aspects and examples can be applied to Internet businesses too."
4,Blast from the Western past!,"Looking for clues to find the culprits who robbed her home, Carin Sage discovers Gideon Avarest, a cowboy dressed in dated attire. She determines that an injury to his head may be the cause to his disorientated manor. But Gideon can't figurewhy his life from the 1880's west isn't reflected in Carin's world of 1997 civilization. He only knows that he escaped certain death by the Earp gang who framed him for murder...and soon Carin too will share in his concerns. A mix of adventure,western charm, and tender romance. We enjoyed!"
2,Not as exciting as the blurb on the cover,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. Though the author writes well, the story moved along at a very slow pace."
3,Changing brakes,I feel the astro pneumatic 7848 8-piece professional brake tool set can be used to work on my Dodge 1978 RV.
4,There's nothing new here,"The author says it himself -- he read 500 books about Hollywood, but he didn't interview anybody, as he felt that everybody had already been interviewed and nothing new would emerge. As a readable summary of other people's research, it's pretty good, and it's entertainingly written -- but I question his arrogance in assuming that he did not need to do any original legwork of his own. When he wrote this book (1986) many of the people and events were still within living memory, and the book would have been the richer and more authentic if he had talked to some of them. Even if they *have* been interviewed before."
5,no to hysterectomy,"It amazes me a lot of woman decide to do their homework about their health only after they had a hysterectomy. I had big, huge fibroids and my only hope was hysterectomy, but I refuse to let the doctors (Here in Florida) do it. I am a past pacient of Dr. West, and I can not have enough words of praise. I hear about the book, check some references, and contact him, had a myomectomy in his competent hands. If your doctor suggest a hysterectomy and you do not have cancer, you should read this book. There is responsible professionals out there willing to do the right thing. Know your options before any surgery. Good luck and Good health"
1,So so so misleading,"Im really not into giving movies bad reviews, for everybody has their own vantage point. Although i will say dead clowns is very misleading. Dont get me wrong, i love indy films. I had been trying to get my hands on a copy of dead clowns because the cover is emaculate. Anything that looks that good on the cover, has to be good right? WRONG. WTF i dont understand i dont think i even saw a fkn clown untill halfway through the movie. No dialouge, very little plot, which my thirteen year old sister could have imagined. I actually bought this copy from amazon. I should have listened to the other reveiewers, when i read this was unbearable. Being stubborned like i am, i just had to find out for myself. I wont tell anyone else not to see this movie, because like i said before everybody has a diffrent vantage point. Ill just tell you to proceed with caution."
1,Why?,"OK I'm not quite understanding why anybody would ever give this flop of a movie 5 stars. Cult classic my @$$. Never in a million years would that ever happen. Here's the real deal. This DVD would be more fun used as a frisbee. It doesn't even deserve ONE star. When I saw the cover I thought ""hmmm this could be cool"". Boy was I wrong. There is barely any dialogue, and the little that there is is BAD. The movie is so dark that you can barely even tell what is going on. And for a movie to be about clowns, um, where are they? There are no freakin clowns, just some stupid zombie looking things that walk around and eat people. There is no plot. There is no story. There is nothing. This movie sucks. It shouldn't even exist. Don't buy, don't rent, don't even bother. I could be more entertained watching paint dry."
1,Finally... I ahve seen the worst horror movie ever,This DVD is just plain awful. The setting is horrible. The storm scenes are terrible. The dialogue is non-existant and the actors deliver them with little emotion. The special effects are sooooooo bad. Anything on TV would have been time better spent.I have seen much better productions from local community theatre groups. This one is definitely in my worst 3 horror movies of all time.
2,What category is below B-movies?,"This was just not good. In the world of straight-to-DVD movies, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. There is minimal dialogue; which is probably a good thing because the actors didn't do too well with the simple lines that they had. The costumes might have been good, but the lighting was so terrible that you couldn't see what was going on most of the time. The lack of a plot was the film's biggest problem. It's just clowns killing people.Unfortunately, there isn't even a cheese factor to give this movie some redeeming quality. I was hoping for something overly done like Killer Klowns from Outer Space. But there is nothing in this movie. This will never be a cult classic, or even a cheap thrill. At least the producers only had to make about 50 bucks to break even on the film."
1,Ugh!,"I have seen this movie. Only the existence of`""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" keeps this from being the worst movie ever made."
5,Something everyone needs to know,"This book will tell you nothing you don't already know. It is very simple and easy to read and the concepts are self apparent. There is nothing new... But that is exactly why this book is so valuable. it provides the framework and language to clarify what everyone already knows, but no one has bothered to explain. How change causes problems, how problems need to be managed, what management does, why is management so difficult, how to manage successfully, what is the secret of success of any organization and a recipe for how you can create your own success. Dr. Adizes is a genius. discover him now and Master Change today."
4,Parlez Francais? Not to worry.,"I guess this is a ""French"" cookbook in the same way that ""French"" words like croissant or mousse are used in English...Nevertheless, totally charming, with precious little ink and watercolor drawings, original coupons for 7 cents off pantry items, and great ads!Lots of recipes for crepes, French soups, the chicken ones we all know, and a good Mornay sauce that she guarantees will be real French flavor. Oh, and the California Salad Bowl.I told you not to expect French..."
1,You gotta be dumb to buy this series,"I'm sure there are some people who could learn something from this book. Unfortunately compared to what's out there, this book is a real waste of time and money.My biggest gripe is the total lack of pictures compared to other books. Hey guys, we're talking about a GRAPHICS program. There are on the average, only one or two picts per page. Hardly enough to get the idea of what the program does.Also, each of the picts are way too small and fuzzy to really see what's going on.There are much better books out there with more pages for less money."
5,He does every song justice!,I Love this cd! It's nice to hear old favorites. He picked a great group of songs. He really does each song justice. I love that he didn't try to change each song much from the originals. His voice is just fabulous for this group of love songs.
3,Donny's comfort zone,"Following his more original and personal ""What I Meant To Say"" album Donny Osomond seems to have slipped firmly back into his comfort zone of singing seventies hits, that he believes, his now older fans from the seventies will buckle at the knees over. From a marketing perspective he's probably right. The album whilst not his best to date, is typically new Donny and fits in with his new re-invented middle age persona. I would have liked to have seen Donny Osmond continue to progress from his last two albums that were both very good. Still, sometimes one needs to be in a comfort zone."
4,romantic songs,This CD is very romantic. I love Donny Osmond so I am bias. Wonderful voice and great music.Made me go back in time!!
3,Donny music,"Most of the songs sound the same as others made in the past, but if you are a Donny fan you will love it, but i just brought to complete my collection of music."
5,Love Songs of the '70s,Donny osmond Love Songs of the '70si cant believe he is still a fantastic singer
2,Donny,"This is not Donny at his best. I really don't think these songs are the best choice for him. I did not enjoy this cd as much as I thought I would.It is Donny however, because I love him, I will still listen to it."
1,"Gotta love Donny, but who produced this?","Most of the songs are well out of Donny Osmond's upper range, the production quality is dreadful and the arrangements are boring. Good idea, love Donny Osmand, but this CD isn't worth the time."
2,A Very Tired Selection of 70s Kitsch,"I think people are entitled to their opinions and people can be respected if they differed from the general stream of thought. I do happen to agree with this person that the selection of songs in this album seem calculated. Donny does not sing with as much passion as before and as such, the fire in his voice and enthusiasm (and feeling) is missing in this album. I was very disappointed with this 70s kitsch album. Clearly, he's jumping on the bandwagon of all these older singers comeback (eg rod steward, barry manilow) by covering these tired numbers. I wish his selection of material were more original and personal. I do believe that he has more sensitivity in delivering stronger and more quiet numbers. Listen to Donny's earlier music. It's more fun !"
5,Incredible CD,This CD is great. Donny Osmond's voice is just incredible. He has such an open quality. It is smooth and beautiful while still being masculine and soulful - but he never goes overboard on the soul. You listen to the songs and they sound like you remember them but with a modern twist. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this CD and hope the Donny will be making more.
5,Takes me back to my teens!,Love this CD. Love to crank it up in the car and sing along. Donny does a lot of the songs better than the originals.
4,What a Nice CD!!,Loved every song ... reminds me of all the fun I had back in junior high and the dances ... this CD can be played over and over ... Enjoy!!!
5,still has it at 50,I've been a fan of Donny Osmond since I was 13! That's 37 years!This album made me sigh just like when I was 13! He still has it at 50.Not till December 9th will Donny be 50!
4,A book that makes you laugh out loud!,"The writing is crisp and clean. The author obviously knows his stuff. He takes the whole Tarzan story and goes places it's never been taken before. It's breezy and fast to read, with some really poetic passages. A friend loaned me his copy and I liked it so much I bought two--one for me, one for a gift. I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but the historical stuff is dead on accurate, and is fascinating to boot. I actually learned a thing or two from a funny book. This should be a movie."
3,soso,thought the movie was better then i remember but oh well the price was good so i got it so it is what it is
4,"Snug, but warm fit","Like reviewer ""Stacey"", I too wear a half size and ordered up. Even then, the slippers are really snug, perhaps because of the density of the shearling. In winter, I like to wear thick socks with slippers. Thick socks won't fit in these slippers, but you don't need the extra layer. These slippers are very warm. The collar can be flipped up to equate a bootie affect around the sides and back of your ankles. I recommend that you order a size larger than you usually wear."
3,"God book, just not a great one.","I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded this one. I don't like reading books that keep going back and forth between the past and the present. For me it just takes the joy out of reading the story, besides...isn't that what prologues are for?Would I recommend this book? No, probably not...sorry."
4,didn't want it to end,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The way the past and present were woven together. Having to wait to see what happened to the past Cassie. I was tickled that the author wrapped things up with what happened to who, when. With the exception of Hank Caldwell. What happened to him? He's the only one that didn't get wrapped up. Ah, well."
4,Momsters!,I personally don't find anything wrong with pageants. Although some of the moms were just unreal. You would think it was all about them!
2,Ridiculous,"I see absolutely nothing interesting or entertaining in this show. I know others like it, but I don't. I truly feel sorry for the kids involved in these pageants."
1,Child abuse,"The parents on the show are abusive and manipulative. It's sad to watch these kids ""perform."" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" got it right."
1,The worst thing on TV,"I agree with everyone else here. This is one step away from child pornography. Disgusting. Take this crap off of the list, Amazon....and this is listed under Editor's picks? Fire the editor."
1,Seriously Amazon?,"I like Amazon because of the simplicity of use, good service, and all around enjoyable experience. But really, Amazon? Toddlers and Tiaras? Personally I'm not a fan of any show on TLC, but this is one of the worst. It should be dropped."
1,Trash,This show is not worth watching or making for that matter. Staring down in hope of removal. Its hard to believe this show is a documentary on why these competitions are bad.
1,Seriously?,"This is pure crap, and evil crap to boot. If I asked someone to provide proof that some people should not be allowed to breed this show is all they would need."
1,Sick parents,"My mum watches this. I cannot believe how the parents can do this crap to their children. Most of the parents are overweight while their daughter is not. They try to live their life through their daughter, because they could never have the life. Many of the children do not want to do it, yet the parents make them. The child have over excessive amounts of make up that makes them look like 3 year old prostitutes. How TV networks allow this kind of crap, or how parents can do this, makes one wonder how insane this world is. I would never let my wife do this crap to my daughter and if she ever did, I would have nothing to do with her. I think the parents have a few nuts and bolts loose in their brains."
4,Solid introduction into the world of intelligence,"I would say that this book would be a good first read for anyone interested in learning more about the intelligence community. It covers a wide variety of information without getting to in-depth into any one subject, so it feels like a pretty well-rounded experience. I also felt that the use of some historical examples really helped not only to make the book more interesting to read but to make some of the concepts easier to understand.My biggest problem with this book is that at points it reads like a college textbook, which isn't always a particularly good thing. I also found some of the sections that talked about the relations between policy and intelligence to be pretty dull. Overall this book is a pretty informative and a mostly enjoyable read."
4,good introductory book ...,"A good introduction book to the Intelligence subject. In this book the author browse all the elements and methods of intelligence in a mix with history examples, that helps you understand all the facts of this world and the importance for a government to use it in order to be updated and alert of international events."
4,Short good read,"This book was incredibly informative, concise, and written for those who want a good lesson on intelligence policy. It has a heavy academic slant and relies solely on open source information. Not recommended for readers looking for answers on ""how"" intelligence is conducted. It focuses on intelligence policies, failures, and successes in communist and democratic nations. It was the perfect length (any longer would beat a dead horse)."
4,Excellent introduction to the world of intelligence,"I read this book as required reading for a class on the history of espionage. Although it reads a bit like a textbook, Shulsky and Schmitt do an excellent job in providing an introduction to intelligence, espionage, and covert action, while providing sufficient real life examples to make it an exciting read. A must for anyone who wishes to find out more about the CIA and other intel organizations."
4,"Silent Warfare: Understanding the World of Intelligence, 3d Edition","There are many same books are on sale, but I could not know if they are shipped abroad. So if you could show on the display before sellecting the item, that will really help me."
2,Mechanism broke.,"I really liked this knife, for about 2 weeks, at which time the spring mechanism broke, rendering this knife useless as it won't stay open. I hate to leave a bad review on a product, but just wanted to let others know that if you purchase this knife, you're kind of at the mercy of the assisted opening mechanism. If it goes out, the knife is nothing more than a paperweight. When you're looking for an EDC knife such as this, you need it to perform anytime and every time. And this one might fail. Hopefully not, but I don't want to take that chance."
2,Warning to left handers,Got this knife a few months about and I would say overall the knife is ok but don't expect it to be on the same level as a SOG or other high end knifes. I have to also warn that if you are left handed I would recommend not buying this knife. The knife has a thumb lock only on the right side of the knife. If you are holding the knife in your left hand you can not release the lock with your thumb since your hand is in the way. The only way to do it is to use both hands.
5,Great knife,"Ive owned this knife for 2 or 3 years and it is a great knife. Mine has a little wobble in the blade when opened but nothing enough to make a difference. The knife is well built, holds an edge forever, and is a very good size to carry. The blade down carry and location of the clip makes it barely noticeable"
2,Quality drop off,"I owned this same knife for years until the spring inside finally broke. It was a very good knife and I used it so often that I decided to get another one.This knife came out of the box sounding like it has sand in the pivot (hinge). It sticks if you try to let it open slowly (controlled). I attempted to disassemble the knife to remove the blade and clean up the stamping burrs from the action, but I couldn't even get it open. Apparently they are so concerned about the pivot (hinge) loosening that they assembled it with gorilla force. I still haven't figured out how to get into it without stripping out the Torx head nuts.Lastly, this ""Stainless Steel"" knife is not really stainless steel. I realized this when it stuck to a magnet that I have in my toolbox.I couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase after having such good success with my last one."
2,quality slipping...now missing,"I'm disappointed in the Gerber Fast Draw knife I purchased recently. In fact, I purchased one that I was disappointed in, so I returned it, thinking it was just a poor single instance, and then bought another. It was no better. I owned a Gerber Fast Draw in the past that I was very pleased with but Gerber must be going to an inferior manugfacturer, now, to have slipped so far. Gerber was less that sympathetic when I contacted them regarding the knife."
1,Ignorance is perplexing,"This book is sheer drivel and as a resident of Phoenix I am appalled at how the ignorant author portrayed each city/town/village listed. The numerous grammatical errors result in distracting the reader and the validity of images and some of the data is at best questionable, the authors criteria for listing a city/town is reasonable at best because as a Phoenix resident I can say that over ONE MILLION people reside here and putting it in the same category as Nederland, CO a town of a few thousand is completely ludicrous, and besides each town has its own reason for existence as well as attractions, if the author wanted to write a book about the worst towns, he should have focused more on actual fact rather than the conjecture of his unnamed field reporters. In essence the title should be changed from ""The Worst Towns in the USA"" to ""The Worst Book in the USA"""
1,Typos and more...,"In addition to the numerous typos and grammatical errors in this book, I question if all the photos are actually of the towns mentioned. For example, in the section dedicated to Roosevelt Island, NY, the photo at the top of page 168 is indeed taken from a Roosevelt Island... in WASHINGTON, D.C. D.C.'s Theodore Roosevelt Island is not even a town but a memorial park in the middle of the Potomac River (that's the T.R. Memorial Bridge and the Lincoln Memorial seen in the photo).The concept of the book is an interesting one and is what made me pick it up at my local library; which is where I suggest you go to peruse this little train wreck of a coffee table book and save your cash for something else."
2,Disappointing,"I think I laughed twice -- it just wasn't funny. It was very repetitive with the most common punchline being ""...on the way out of town!"" and variations thereof. What was really missing from this book were personal accounts which added color. Instead, the author cited crime statistics and showed pictures that could have been taken from almost any town. (Oh, my! A derelict building must surely mean trouble.)The atrocious editing has been cited multiple times in these reviews, and they aren't kidding. Someone typed this in once and never proofed it.Sadly, the author had high hopes for a second volume, promising that he would continue his travels to reveal more bad towns, and asking his readers to vindicate any listings with which they disagreed. Probably won't happen."
1,Buyer beware!,"I purchased this machine new in January and by mid-August it stopped working. Two months later it still hasn't been fixed. So far I've had six scheduled repair visits, each of which require that I take a half day off work to accommodate them. Whirlpool service refuses to consider a replacement or refund and tells me I should be grateful for their service.So before you think about buying this, ask yourself if you can afford to go for two months without a washing machine and spend days away from work waiting for repairmen.I strongly recommend that you research other online reviews where you'll see countless similar complaints with Whirlpool customer service."
1,Not what I was looking to buy,"Wished there was an option to hear what was on the CD before the purchase. I wanted the actual musical named Carmina Burana and thought the Medieval Poems and Songs would be similar, but I personally do not like the ""music"" or ""songs"" on this CD. Just a personal preference."
2,"I beg your pardon, Ms. Cheatham","Contrary to your claim, Shakespeare did indeed ""have the full benefit of the thinking of the Reformation."" He was born during the reign of Protestant Queen Elizabeth. Relatives and others in his circle were tortured and executed for being Catholics.Please check your facts before you opine."
2,Too lengthy,"There is much valuable information in this book, but it takes far too much of a time commitment to follow it through and do the exercises."
1,This will screw up your kindel,I had all sorts of softwear problems with my kindle the day I downloaded this. When I deleted it because I couldn't read it any way My kindle started working normally. If You want this get it on CD.
1,James Earl Jones should stick with Darth Vader.,"I was excited to get this CD set, since I know James Earl Jones has a great set of pipes, and I have listened so much to Alexander Scourby's reading of the Bible that I was ready for a new reading. I was disappointed the first time I listened. Jones does not use inflection while he reads; the result is that the words sound lifeless. As a Christian believer, that abhors me.But more than his lifeless reading, I am apalled at Jones' changing of the text. He is reading the King James Version, but he changes the words at will. For example, the text will read ""Christ Jesus"" and Jones will read ""Jesus Christ."" I counted 21 errors in his reading of the Book of Ephesians alone. If you believe, as I do, in the divine inspiration of the Word of God, you will not be able to stand how Jones imposes his own changes to the text without any textual or scriptural justification. Jones should stick with Darth Vader."
2,Disappointing,"The guy has a voice like no one else, but the original King James version language (all the ""unto's"" and ""ye's"" and ""thou's""). - lame backround music - and a whispery, momontone reading (if you can imagine James Earl Jones doing that) - makes this far inferior to Johnny Cash's reading of the New Testament.Johnny Cash proclaims the Word of God beautifully and simply. If you're not much of a believer, it just is done well and straight forward.The New King James Version in Cash's reading is more modern English (Easier on the ears.) But this is still majestic langauge. Also, no accompanying organ music. Just him reading slowly and with understanding.If you are going to buy one - get Johnny Cash reading the New Testament."
4,driving with the bible,This is a quality product. The only con is that they play backround music while reading Sciptures. That is distracting as both the Word and the music are good.
2,Buy another version,"Mr. Jones uses a dead monotone voice, mispronouncing words, and does not read a complete sentence fluidly.""And then......Jesus said to his......disciples, go and......find Mary...."" etc etcDrove me crazy and I'm sorry I spent so much money on this. I will look for another version and listen to the speaker before I buy!"
3,Nice,"I purchased it for my father, but we didn't use it that much yet the quality of the DVDs seemed fine.Charlton Heston made a Bible DVD set too, and I'm thinking that might be more exciting then this one. Of what I heard of the DVD it did seem well, kind of dull. Yet I believe that the Bible, read properly, can be very exciting. I give these DVDs a rating of ""alright."""
1,Activa Watches Defective,"I ordered this watch, Activa Children's Elephant Design Watch #SV621-001, and three similar (different colors/designs) Activa children's watches in November to give for Christmas. I didn't open the watches until I was gift wrapping them a day or two before Christmas. None of the watches worked. I took them to a battery shop, where I learned that the watches were defective in that the stems/crowns of all had been pulled out when the watches were manufactured (maybe years ago) and the batteries had thus run down. When the batteries were replaced ($7 each), three watches worked and one didn't."
2,"If you think Mohamed AlFayed is wacky, these guys are worse!","I was a little afraid this book would be off the wall and I've found that I was right, AlFayed looks calm and reasonable next to these guys. I really don't see why publication kept being put off unless it was in the hope that the smell would die down. The authors present just a few pages worth of peculiarities and irregularities in the crash investigation and related events and manage to weave what would be a little pretty good stuff (presented here as supporting evidence!) into all sorts of conspiracies involving international banking, arms dealing, the CIA & MI6, The Catholic and Protestant Churches, the Masons, even the Royal Family and supposed links to the Scottish Stuart Royal family and Jesus Christ. I had dim hopes for this book but what I really want to say about what it is Amazon won't print."
4,What's done in the Dark will soon come to Light!,"I have just read the book, ""The Hidden Evidence"". This book is not for the faint of heart. You will not be ""entertained"". The tragic, premature death of a young, iconoclastic Royal is bad enough, but to come to terms with what may have been an arranged ""accident"" may be too much to bear for some! If you can get past the ""historic"" ramifications, for instance, claims of ""royal"" geneology from Jesus and beyond, plus the ""masonic"" connection with the former in-laws, then you must expect to be enthralled, shocked and lastly, made aware of how the ""real"" world works. If this indeed did happen as this book asserts, then we are ALL in deep and serious trouble."
3,Somewhat compelling conspiracy theories,"The authors of this book use Diana's mysterious death as a starting point for a book that seems to deal primarily with CIA and MI6 involvement in nafarious activities ordered by corporate ""Godfathers"" who they claim really control world politics. Some of the information is compelling and interesting. I do believe that they make a good case for the fact that Diana was murdered but it really wasn't the focus of this book as much as the tittle would imply."
1,The Prosecution Lost the Case,"The book was written in the form of a trial and the reader is the jury. Well, if I was on that jury, I would have voted for the defense. And if I was the judge, I would have thrown the case out after the prosecution finished his case for lack of evidence. The title is perfect ""Hidden Evidence"" as the evidence was so hidden that I couldnt find it in the book. The author makes many hypothesis but does not have any REAL support for his hypothesis.I believe that we have not heard the full and real story of the death of Diana and was hoping to find it here - but I was disappointed. Stay clear."
2,Hidden or Recalled Evidence?,"Jon King and John Beveridge offer some intresting theories for the murder of Diana, Princess of Wales; however, the book lacks focus and wanders from the Jews (BC) to the Stuart dynasty to a supposed plot to put Diana on the throne in order to fill up 400 pages. The authors often make a point, then recant or weaken it by offering other explanations. Some information was given by sources who could not prove their statements, so the book was given a ""maybe, maybe not"" quality. The whole book could have been summarized in a few pages without all of the extraneous elements thrown in. A bit ""over the top"" for my taste."
2,Poorly Written,"The premise for this book was and is still interesting; however, this writer is in need of an editor!! The book is highly repetitive and the arguments are not well organized. There is information that is valid and does bring up questions in one's mind; however, there are too many times when the author does not follow through on validating his claims (ie, ""I'd lay out the evidence, but it is not legal"" - since when??). Maybe someone else could have a go at this one."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"Wow, I can't believe these guys are serious. Next we will be hearing that Islamic militants killed her. The explantion of how Henri Paul was really a harmless innocent is hilarious. I wondered why the publication date for this kept getting pushed back and now I know -- the authors probably had to shop around for a publisher desperate enough to print this. For irrational conspiracy theorists only."
5,Beware the military-industrial complex,"Fascinating. A book for people who don't read ""Diana books"", and for those who do. One of the most important books of our time. The least this book should result in is a reopening of the crash investigation. We must be brave like Diana, and not cave in like Coward Clinton, and continue her efforts to ban anti-personnel landmines. Economics are NOT worth more than human lives."

4,RIP William Hamilton,"Purchased and read after a heart warming, curiosity provoking obituary of William Hamilton who passed away in 2012. It skillfully, thoughtfully posits the existence and rationale for Christian Atheism. A difficult read worth the effort."
1,wordy and beyond me,"I got the idea that they thought the christian god is dead but not why, or how, or whatever they meant by that. It was a hard read and when I finished I threw the book away, thinking no one else should waste their time. I don't think much of religion but I expect more out of criticism than a wordy restatement that god is dead."
2,Though it was much better,"After reading Watchers, I couldn't wait to read another book written buy Koontz. That's why I decided to by three!. Unfortunatelly it wasn't a very good decision. The stories are boaring dificult to follow and wors, predictable! Should I swap to King?"
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, the clamp and teeth are too big to easily catch and hold the smaller rings of a bracelet. Wish I had bought the other kind that I know now works better. Just thought this would make a nice little gift for a friend and to have an extra one for me. Sadly, not worth returning them..."
1,Terrible product!,A cheap piece of plastic! The worst thing I ever purchased :( It does not work and is already falling apart!
2,Awkward,"Maybe I just need more practice, but am having a hard time clasping my bracelets with this gizmo. The alligator clasp comes off pretty easily if you grab your bracelet the wrong way. I guess I'll just keep asking my husband to do this for me."
4,Good Product,This product really helps when trying to put your bracelet on without help from another person.
1,Useless,"The clip is designed to hold the ringlet, but only has teeth on one side. As you maneuer it into place and try to get a hold of the clasp to open it, the ringlet invariably slips free of the clip and you must start all over again. I'm right handed and was trying to put the bracelet on my left wrist. After failing a half a dozen times, I decided to try it on my right wrist. It didn't work any better. Save your money and get a friend to help you put on your bracelet."
5,Great item,I gave this to my sister for her birthday and she loves it. She wears bracelets all the time and this bracelet buddy is a great help. I have one that is similar and I use it every time I wear a bracelet. One thing I like about this one is that the part that holds the bracelet is plastic and will not scratch the jewelry. Mine is older and has metal teeth that I had to cover with tape. I highly recommend this item.
2,Cheaply made,"I have had the Bracelet Buddy for several weeks now and I still cannot get it to work. I think part of the problem is that the alligator clip is plastic, instead of metal, and it doesn't get a good grip on the bracelet. I have wrapped a rubber band around the clip in the hope that it will hold it closed better. I haven't given up on it yet but I am very disappointed."
3,Cheaply made,"This is nothing soecial. It works ""ok."" Made of cheap plastic. How much I really like this remains to be seen."
4,Jewelry,The bracelet buddy works ok. I can now put my jewelry on by myself. Very simple to use. I like it.
4,OK so far,"These were purchased as gifts, so I don't know what the quality is really like. The concept is great. I've owned one of this type of thing for years and I love it. The gold turned design is not my style, but the selection of this tool is limited. Delivery and packaging were fine."
2,Not worth the money,"The bracelet buddy is a good idea, but it doesn't work. The clip isn't strong enough and doesn't hold the bracelet long enough to attach the clasp."
4,love it,i love the bracelet buddy but i am afraid it will break easily. i hope not because it really helps me.
1,Hunk of cheap plastic!,Not worth a cent! No carry case as described in item description. Waste of money! Don't think they'd even sell in a .99 cent store with a clear conscience.
1,Unfriendly buddy,"On first try this product lost its grip. The black ""jaws"" simply could not hold the end of the bracelet. Don't buy because you'll be sorry and it is not worth returning because it is poor manufacturing, and the next one you would get would be equally poor."
1,JUNK,"This bracelet holder is the worst excuse for a product I believe I have ever seen. The whole thing only weighs 6/10ths of an ounce. Yes, that is 6/10ths of an ounce. The tip is huge, too huge to use on fine jewelry. This item is cheap, thin plastic, including the tip you hold your bracelet in. Just absolute crap. Doesn't work worth a darn. Please take it off Amazon and don't lower your self to this standard of workmanship. If I could give a zero rating I would."
2,bracelet buddy,"It is made from cheep plastic, I anticipate it breaking soon, it does not hold chain or clasp very well, mosre awkward to use then seems."
4,Useful gadget,"This little gadget is so useful -- just hold your bracelet still with the hand you are putting it on and engage the clasp with the other. If you don't have anyone to help, you don't have to give up wearing bracelets!!! So simple and so helpful."
3,Not easy to use,I have trouble using this product. Perhaps it is me but more often than not I can't get it to do what it's expected to do.
2,Cheap,"This little wand is a really good idea and would work fine if it was made out of more substantial materials, but you are paying WAY too much for cheap plastic. Mine broke in the middle the first time I used it. I think perhaps if the unit didn't have so many smaill thin areas where the little 'beads' meet it would be more worthwhile."
5,LOVE IT !!!,"A life saves! It is never easy trying to put bracelet on by yourself, but this little tool is awesome!!! A must have for anyone who wears bracelets!"
1,Doesn't work,This product didn't work for me the tip is cheap and plastic and it does not clamp on well to jewerly. I sent it back. Ladies find one with a metal tip.
1,Very cheap quality,"I had a nice bracelet helper at one time and after my mother admired it, I gave it to her. I ordered this as a replacement was very disappointed in the quality, especially for the price. It is made of molded, cheap plastic with the seam running down the side. Even the clasp is plastic and feels very fragile. Doesn't grip well either. I expected much better for this price. Not worth the trouble to return, but you can definitely get a better product for the money."
1,Do not waste your money or effort on these.,"These are cheap retreads. They are just a notch above the public domain films of Utopia and Flying Deuces that are everywhere.Use your money and go to Amazon.co.uk and get the complete collection of remastered shorts and features. Two-reel, three reel, all of them. Get your self a region free player and enjoy these, they are wonderful."
5,"Fiction yes, but lots of fun!","Although the book is fiction, and it is only one interpretation of Revelation, that does not discredit the authors' innovative writing style and wonderful ideas. There are not too many books (although I love reading) that capture my attention and require me to force myself to put it down. Frank Peretti's novels, and the ""Left Behind"" series are two such phenomenons. I feel that the questions that the book(s) of Jenkins and LaHaye provoke are interesting, challenging, and motivating. It made me want to read Revelation, Daniel, and Matthew all over again! I have been truly blessed by their writing, and feel that they have done a spectacular job. God bless them!"
3,The Indwelling,"I have enjoyed this series very much and continue to look forward to the next story. I do feel they are beginning to drag out and that the series needs to be concluded. It seems like the author is stretching the story just to keep going. This particular issue, while still a great story, was quite slow and I found myself skipping over some areas looking for some ""excitement"" and ""anticipation"". Unlike the first books in the series, I was able to leave this one and come back to it later."
3,Filler Book,"I waited on baited breath for the release of ""Indwelling,"" and I was very disappointed. After reading Apollyon and Assassins, I was on an action high, that the Indwelling did not possess. It felt more like a ""filler book."" The kind of book that leads up to something better. Or maybe it is the fact that everyone who has read the series knows the main climax of the ""Indwelling,"" and it takes so very long to get there that you're tired from the small talk by the time the climax begins. Overall, it was a decent book, but a far cry from its predecessors."
2,SLOW--AGAIN,"Although it was better than Book No. 6, it could have been a little more exciting. Like some of the other reviews have said, it could have been only 30 pages long. Please, Authors, if you can't make them more exciting like the first ones, don't stretch them out to 12 books. I keep asking myself why I keep buying them--hope they will be better each time, I guess. I hope also that the authors are not in it just for the money."
3,Get to the point,"Okay, so in ever book we go over each characters background again and again. We mention Rayford Steele's full name almost every time he's mentioned. (As opposed to all of the other Rayfords?) Anyway...The book was interesting but I honestly thought it could have been accomplished in 150 pages. The other 150 + pages were background noise. It is still interesting but..."
1,The momentum got Left Behind,"Okay, I am a fan of the series, and loved most of the books, but the last 2 have dragged. Assasins was better the further you got into it, but The Indwelling bored me silly. It didn't drag, it stopped dead....I hope The Mark is better than this one was....."
2,Growing disappointment . . .,". . . with the series. I have read all the books, and I must admit that this one disappointed me somewhat. I have enjoyed these novels for what they are; a fictional dramatization of one possible interpretation of the end times. The Indwelling left me a little cold. I read it in about 4 hours and at the end my jaw practically dropped. That was it? The story covered only a few days' time and told me practically nothing that I hadn't already figured out.While I am reluctant to say this about two of my brothers in Christ, I can't help but feel that the focus of this series has turned from producing entertaining fiction to making money. I sincerely hope that is not the case. The series could have been done in 7 books as originally planned, I think.Chances are I'll buy #8, The Mark. I hope it is an improvement over #7. If not, I suspect I will not buy any more of these novels."
4,"The seventh in the Left Behind series reveals ""whodunnit""","Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesAs our characters enter in to the second half of the Tribulation, Satan takes possession of Carpathia, as predicted in the book of Revelations. It took forever in the book for it to actually happen though. The book picks up right at the end of #6, Assassins, where Carpathia is killed, and the entire scope of book 7 encompasses not much more than three days.As followers stream in from all over the world for Carpathia's over-the-top funeral, his closest advisors try to figure out who killed Carpathia. The authors will take readers on quite a trail as they try to guess who really did it. I figured it out almost immediately, but it was interesting to follow the different threads throughout hinting at different possibilities.However, it seemed a long book to get through three days if you ask me, but I'll keep reading. I've gone too far to stop now!"
2,The series has run out of steam...,"I have eagerly read and enjoyed the series but have to admit, the characters are starting to wear thin. The thing that keeps me reading these books is to see exactly how Lahaye and Jenkins will interpret the Book of Revelations and how that will look in ""now"" times. I just think it's time to wrap up the series now. Too much reiteration of the prior plots, thin characters (I just can't feel much emotion for any of them- not enough character development and too many of them), and redundancy- ugh! I love Christian fiction but this one is tired out. Please guys- don't do 12 books in total. Try to wind it up soon. Succinct is good in this case."
5,Outstanding!,"As the Left Behind series gets deeper and deeper into the story, the books keep getting better and better. I started this book at 6pm on May 24, and finished it 8 hours later at 2 am on the 25th. I could not put it down! The plot thickens, the characters develop, new twists, this book has it all."
3,The Indwelling,"The Indwelling is the seventh in Left Behind series. As the world comes to grips with the assignation of Nicolae Carpathia, the Tribulation Force knows the man's evil isn't over yet. As the band of Christians grows, so does the danger around them. No one is safe.The Indwelling is like most of the other Left Behind books. True, the story is exciting, though the writing can be a little sloppy in places, and sometimes things can become a little confusing with so many characters. If you enjoy apocalyptic thrillers, however, this is one you won't want to skip."
3,Not so riveting,"This is a great series and up until now I have been completely captivated. This book was a big let down. Unlike previous books, the plot just muddled along barely keeping my interest. You don't get to the biggest event in the Tribulation until the last 75 pages or so. Some of the inner conflicts the characters are going through seem superficial and far-fetched, especially after everything they have gone through. I, of course, will be buying the next book; but praying that the authors get back on track."
4,Fiction,"First of all I think it is very important to remember this series is fictional, although based on scriptural truths.The writing is not the most outstanding, but it is an action series in a lot of ways. I do not know how anyone who starts at the beginning of it all can walk away from this story. It's compelling; I think the characters are realistic. You find your self hating some and cheering for others it is a clear line between good and evil. It is a fun series lighten up and enjoy it for what it is. Good Clean Fiction."
1,Revelation,"All the ""Left Behind"" books are clumsy attempts to transpose the Book of Revelation of John into our times. Revelation was ridiculouss at the time it was written, and it is much more so today. The dragon, the first beast and the second beast, the 4 riders of the Apocalypse etc. were creatures invented by the author of Revelation to cow a superstitious and credulous audience into submission. The goal hasn't changed, only the audience. Common people today know much less about religion than they did in the 2nd C AD, and are therefore easier to manipulate."
1,More of the same...,"I don't know how long this can continue, but this book justcontains more of the same schlock as all the others. Poor writingcombines with silly plot lines to make another big-seller that deserves doorstop status instead."
1,Disturbing,"As a literature lover, I find it troubling that this book, with its large print, TV-byte writing, and shallow characters, is so popular. As a Christian, I'm disturbed by its fortress mentality and the reduction of Christianity to an insurance policy. I think Jenkins means well, but I hope readers who are dissatisfied with the Christianity presented in this series will look further and not judge it based solely on these books."
2,I hope #8 is better ...,"I have read all seven books in the series. The Indwelling was nowhere near the quality of the others. In this book, the plot comes to a near standstill. I loved the other six, but The Indwelling just is not that great."
5,Great book if you read all the other ones,"The book seems to develop a little bit slower in this one, but of course at the end it is jam-packed with inrigue. It must be hard to write 7 books that all contain the same story plot. I would recommend people to read the whole series if they can it may just save your life."
1,"Yes, TRIPE!","Regardless of the authors' intent, this book is just BAD, BAD, BAD and they should be ashamed to market it in the name of Christ. I HAVE read Revelation (it's not ""Revelations,"" by the way) and there are plenty of other sources that non-believers can read to get a good explanation of it -- for instance, any of Tim LaHaye's books about Revelation. As far as excusing the authors for poor writing because they are publishing a book every six months -- no one made them publish them that close together or forced them to string the series out over so many books. Again, this is criticism of the writing of men -- not the inspired Word of God."
2,The Indwelling,I received it in reasonable condition on the last day it was promised. more words more words more words more words
3,back to nonstop action,this book was much better than the last 2. it was full of action and again edge of your seat stuff. i was also very happy that this one didnt go back into the past over and over again. it said what needed to be said if only to refresh the readers memory and moved right back into action. i will admit that im not going to have a hard time waiting for the next installment(s) but will more likely than not read them..::smile
2,moving to a crawl,"The first two books in this series were good, but since then its been getting worse book by book. This book moves so slow its unbelievable. It leaves you with the impression that the authors have run out of things to write about and are deliberately slowing the story down banking on the success of their first books."
3,Too Many Books,"I like this series and I am sure I will follow it to the end. The ""end"" however does not need to be 7 or 8 more books down the road. The Indewlling, while good, only covers a few days. The series has become slow and plodding. I am not sure if the authors feel the content dictates the pace but I wonder if they are stretching it in favor of revenue. I was hooked by the explosive pace and the content of the first two volumes. Each since has become slower and slower. Pick it up or you will lose readership would be my advice to them. This is a great opportunity to bring those of us who are not as religously focused as we should be ""back home"". Don't lose it."
2,Worst of the Series,This is the worst book of the series. Almost nothing happens. You might as well save your money and read the intro in the next book.
4,A tool for approaching Revelations,"Once again, we join the Tribulation Force as they prepare for the end of time. The book starts with a brief introduction to who the major characters are (believers, unbelievers, and undecideds) as well as a brief section (less than two pages) from the end of &#65533;Assassins.&#65533; In this book, we are finished the second woe and are prepared for the approach of the Beast.As in the other books, the pace is fast, so you will find yourself compelled to finish the book at one setting. After talking with my family, I found that it wasn&#65533;t just me trying to read it all at once. Unfortunately, this results in the events not getting the description or explanation that you may wish. I would not let this deter you from reading the books. Anything that helps us to understand the events of Revelations is good.I would recommend this book."
4,Indwelling,"I could hardly wait for Indwelling to hit the bookstores. So, I had to find another way, Amazon.com. They brought this great! book to my door at work and I proceeded to read. I had already re-read the previous six (6) three times. I have shipped this series to my nephew in prison in Virginia. He has since shared with many inmates. He always has many, many questions about Revelation. This series has prompted these question. This series is a great way to peak the unbelievers interest in God's Gift of love through Salvation through Jesus Christ. It warms my heart to be able to share in prison the shared talents of LeHaye and Jenkins. Keep writing as I continue to search the Scriptures for growth and knowledge in God Word. Thank You."
1,The Pits! (no pun intended),"A family member who likes these books keeps passing them on to me, and I have read them ONLY so we can discuss them. I think they are the most ineptly written fiction... for either children or adults...that I've ever seen. It's too bad someone with the ability to create believable characters, story line and dialogue hasn't had the kind of success with fiction derived from biblical prophecies that LaHaye and Jenkins are enjoying. I fear that this series has alienated many more people from belief in God than it has won over. (My aforementioned family member has finally conceded that the writing in the ""Left Behind"" series is ""pretty awful."")"
1,This is highway robbery,"I agree with all those that thought that this book was a review of all the preceding books. I could have visited Barnes and Nobles, Sam Wholesale or any other bookstore and spent 30 minutes reading the last couple of pages. That's where the story of the book should have started. This book was a BIG let-down. The opening chapters should have been on the body of Nicholae coming back to life and the person responsible for his death, not how everyone was trying to get away. For the next book, I'll wait for the reviews. And will someone please tell me the page number to start reading?"
1,disappointed again,"I've been hanging in here, waiting for God knows what with this series. The first book was great -- thought provoking and a little bit frightening. Every book since then has been a disappointment. And with each new release, my suspicion grows that Jenkins and Lahaye are greedy; trying to sell more books by stretching this series wayyyyyyy out. Well, this is it. No more. I've read my last Left Behind book."
3,Good series...but dragging it out...,"I really enjoy this series for the message it is trying to send to the world. One thing we do need to keep in mind is that it is FICTION. On the same note, ""The Indwelling"" was way too boring, for lack of a better word. Okay so the Beast takes possession, but at the end of the book? I've read these other reviews and I surely pray that the authors are not dragging this series out to 12 books for money; that the next ones will be more involved. With 3 1/2 years left, it's awfully suspicious that this book covered only three days..."
2,Money Talks,"I and my husband were very disappointed in Book #7,""The Indwelling"". We felt taken by the lack of substance in the book compared to the previous books. Surely, the authors are not trying to drag out the series for the money! I am hoping they will redeem themselves with their readers in Book #8. Please don't take advantage of your readers!"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I am an avid Left Behind Series reader. I've read all the books and own all the CD's that have come out. I'm hooked! BUT...the latest - The Indwelling - has no punch, no bite. I understood when the series first started that it would be seven books. This is book seven and we're only at the three and a half year mark, and then this book covers such a small space in time that it may be four more years to complete the series. Don't get me wrong, I'm in no hurry to get to the END but the books need to keep moving at the pace of the first six. My wife says I'm wrong, and I pray I am, but it appears that the authors may be getting greedy (more books than originally planned, payed speaking engagements, a movie, CD's and tapes). Mr. Lahaye, Mr. Jenkins, please get back to the basics which has made this series so popular. This is the first time I've seen so many negative reviews for any of your books. I hope you're seeing them, too. God Bless."
3,Eliminate 200 pages and we could have a winner!,"While the first six books in the ""Left Behind"" series were difficult to put down, ""The Indwelling"" annoyed me with its perpetual wheel spinning. After reading more than 200 pages of this book, I was irritated that it was still at the same point in time where the previous book had ended.If the authors need to buy more time between publications, I recommend that they do not make their readers wait so long. Make the volumes smaller, eliminate picayune details and repetitious verbiage, and publish more frequently. Readers do not need 400 pages when the story can be told in 150."
5,The Best Yet,"I loved this book! In my opinion, it is the best one written yet. No slow parts, always leaving you in anticipation of what will happen next!"
2,Get on with it already,"the book started off really good but soon beacme just another game of wait and see, so to the authors get on with it already for those of us that have read the whole series this was very disappointing hope the next one is not as lacking in story line"
4,"Excellent, but not up to the standards of previous books.","While the book was still an excellent read, it did drag on for the first 200-300 pages. The character development was good, and there were enough sub-plots to keep the story moving. But at some points it was difficult to maintain my attention. Some of the plot lines did not make much sense. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to everyone who is engaged in the series up to this point. I have a feeling that the best is yet to come!"
3,Common!,"I LOVE the Left Behind series. These books have helped me to better understand some of the events that might take place after the Rapture. What I don't understand is why they put this book out. It only covered 5 days, at most, and The Indwelling didn't even happen 'till the end of the book! I understand that most of the info that was in the beginning of the book was needed, but it probably could have been condensed. I now really want the next book (The Mark) so that I can continue to learn more. This book needs to be read, but don't do it if you're tired!"
4,The Indwelling,"The Indwelling was great. I admit that it started a little slow, but so was Assassins and it was also great book overall. I understand some people were disappointed in the book because it only covered three days, but remember, this is the second biggest event during tribulation and that is something that needed to concentrated on. The Glorious Appearing will be the biggest event of the series and it will probably only cover a couple of days....."
3,Okay,"This book wasn't the best in the series. Most of the time you're waiting for Carpathia to be resurrected. But if you want to know what happens in the next book ya gotta read this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book. But when such a series is so highly acclaimed, you expect excellent."
2,Not Great,"I agree with those who said the message is great, the writing horrible. I am perplexed that the authors would drag a good story out to 12 books, making it a tiresome rip-off. The first book fished me in because I liked the characters and found the idea compelling. However, I have been increasingly disappointed with the quality, and must agree that the authors may be motivated by money rather than producing a quality story. Too bad, because this seems to leave a sour taste in the mouths of non-believers, who this series should be reaching."
3,the indwelling,"for me reading this book, it was getting really old reading this series. so it was kinda hard to keep reading, even though i still did. but it was just getting old and tired for me."
1,Skip this one!,"This is the worst of the series. I enjoyed the previous books; however, this one was very limited. It's a shame, you can sum up the whole book in one sentence. Nicolae Carpathia dies and comes back alive. No surprises, little action.Skip this book in the series and wait for the next one."
2,confused,I read five books in the series while visiting my son in VA on vacation for a week. The first 4 books were great and by the time I got to the 6th and 7th my interest fell. I bought the 6th and 7th when I got back home. I was very disapointed it was very hard to keep up with the story. There seemed to be very little of one in the seventh. I will not get another. There certainly was a long wait for the 8th book.
2,"Put this series to bed, Please!","I admit, I've gotten hooked on this series just like the rest of you. But I've had the feeling since the second book that I'm being sucked into this never ending series just to line the pockets of the authors. All of these books could have easily been combined into one nice fat paperback. The latest, the indwelling, had only about 50 pages of substance, with the subject of the title not taking place til the last two or three pages. While I enjoy the story that is unfolding, after reading each of them I've felt like I had just been robbed."
1,Augh!,"Why,oh WHY is this poorly written book hailed as such a great work?! The writing style reminds me of how I used to write when I was in 5th grade..the dialouge is unbelivable. Why couldn't they have just made it a shorter story? Or just tacked a prolouge onto the previous book or something? 3/4 of the book is filler and does Rayford Steel always have to toss off some psuedo-dramatic one liner? This is so full of cliches that I keep waiting for Carpathia to rub his hands together and burst into a fit of insane laughter...Ugh,don't waste your time on this series!"
4,An Out-of-Body Experience!,"This is one of the better books in the series for it's blend of mysteries and tense interactions between our heros and the Global Community. There is one annoying element in the books that is becoming more frequent. That is that no one engaged in a conversation with another hardly ever finishes a sentence because they are always being interrupted in mid-sentence! Overlooking that, this book progresses right along with scripture, and even gives us a satisfying view of an out-of-body experience."
3,slowing down,"I thought this was a good book but not a great one. After reading the first six books in the series I have to say this is one of the least compelling. I felt that the entire first half was a review course. The action didn't start until I was down to the last few chapters. I hope the authors revisit the idea of making this a twelve book series. They went from their best effort (ASSASINS) to their worst in just 6 months. I love the series and the message, I just hope they don't continue to drag it out just to set a record for best-sellers. I hope the next one is better!"
3,Well!,"Maybe I've been spoiled by the first of it's series: (LeftBehind) because I've YET to become THAT engrossed in any of the 6books that have since followed. (but, hey.... we still have the remaining 5 more to go, and who knows..... maybe ONE OF those will GET ME GOOD... again!)"
3,Give us more...,"I have read all 7 of the Left Behind series as well as the 8 Kids editions. After waiting months for this book, I was a little disappointed at the short period of time it covered. Basically, only 3 days. Since we already knew what was coming, (based on the title, if nothing else) it was a let down to have it end where it did. The other books left us hanging with the ""who did that""s and the ""what's going to happen next"" cliffhangers. This book ended differently, with a sort of ""well, we know something is going to happen"" but it didnt seem to leave me with the hunger for the next book... not enough leading into the next, making the mind work angles, etc. like the other books have. As far as a series, this is the best I have read in a long time. And there is something for everyone... danger, suspense, mystery, dischord, harmony, longing... and it brings to light a unique way to look into the book of Revelations. What a wonderful way to spread the Faith!"
1,Y'all ought to be ashamed of yourselves...,"Okay...I've been reading the series..okay..I'm a Christian...and I did enjoy assassins.....more than the rest...but after 300 pages and still no ""indwelling"", as it were...and, in 300 (out of 4)...only slightly more than THREE days have passed. Filler...filler..and filler...yea...I'll most likely finish out the series...(a flaw I know...)...but Tim and Jerry...a little intelligence, PLEASE......y'all have talent...you've shown that.....please don't give in to the easy way......*sigh*"
1,Big waste of time.,"Why does it take a whole book to have one little thing happen? At the rate these authors are going, this Left Behind series will be as long as an encyclopedia set. Get on with it, PLEASE! I really enjoyed the first few books, but soon started to realize that they are milking this for all it is worth. This series, in my opinion, is becoming a big waste of time. I am so glad that I borrowed this #7 book."
2,Mistitled,"This book should have been called (A long drawn out lead up to)The Indwelling. Nothing really happens until the final ten pages. As I read, I kept telling myself that surely something will happen in the next few pages. This book should have started where it ended and moved on from there. It is, of course, a must read, but only because it's part of the series. I appreciate the authors presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I can't help but feel like they are trying to sell books rather than advance the storyline. Let's hope the next one is more to the point."
2,The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession,"Considering how much I liked the first six books, this one was definitely a disappointment. The entire book covered a grand total of three days and didn't say anything that we didn't already know. I felt it was just a ""quick fix"" item to fill a gap till the next ""real"" book comes out. At least I'm hoping that the next one, The Mark, is better written and has more meat to it than this sad edition."
3,Middle of the Road,"I enjoyed the book. I have enjoyed all of the ""Left Behind"" books. However, in the beginning the authors had mapped out 6 or 7 books. What happened with that? Even the Bible isn't that long to try and get a point across. While I enjoyed the book and will read the remaining ones, at the same time I feel like I am being ripped off by men of God. And I feel like that is too bad and very sad at the same time. Perhaps we truly are in the ""last days"". I suppose I am the fool though because I will buy the rest of them, providing the actual Rapture doesn't occur first, because I have been enjoying them.All of us know our own souls. We all have a decision to make where Christ is concerned. It would be my hope that many would come to know him through these books. For many people the Bible is hard to read and these are very easy to read and follow. While it is fiction, it is also someone's viewpoint of what could be down the road.My opinion, my words."
2,Disappointed,"As an avid reader of the series, I was disappointed that this book covered less than a week's worth of activity. With 3 and 1/2 years left to cover, the next four books will have to be pretty intense. I agree with the reviewer who said that this should have been condensed and made a few chapters in a more filled out book."
3,InDwellling ok.,"While I enjoyed The In Dwelling I don't think it met the standard of the first six books. Too much filler, not enough action or character development. 385 pages to cover less than a week is a bit much. A more streamlined approach could end the series in another couple of books. However, I avidly await number 8. This may not be the best series ever, but it's pretty darn good."
3,"Luke-warm on the ""Left Behind"" heat-o-meter","This book is a good read, but a little slow considering the other successes in this book series. The story moves slowly without Carpathia around, but picks up steam when he makes his reappearance. Just when the things really get rolling, the book ends. I guess they know how to make you come back for more..."
3,Not the best in the series,"I am a fan of this series of books and just have to say that this is not one of the best. Long and drawn out, this book only covers three or four days. Rayford is out of character from the start of the book. Just do not believe that he would leave a member of the force behind. The killer came as a surprise to me, but not much else. I just hope that this is not the start of the falling off of this series of books."
2,Let's get on with it!,"This book is 388 pages! Read the first 50 and the last 100 and you will not miss a thing in the story. I read it and now feel like I am being strung along for a ride that could last forever. I thought I had heard early on that this series of books was supposed to be a total of 7. Not so! The authors could string this out forever if they wanted to. Not to give it away, but the time period covered in this book was 3 days. This is not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it could have been better and contained a lot more. If you skip this one in the series, you haven't missed anything."
1,[I Feel] Rip-Off[ed off],"I feel as though someone has stolen my wallet! Don't waste your money on this book! I have never thought this series was particularly well written but the subject matter was kind of compelling and so I kept reading each new installment. NEVER AGAIN! With this latest, they have truly lost me. ...This book is nothing but filler. It takes the entire book for one major event to happen! And the ending just promises more of the same -- filler."
2,Sub-Par Writing,"I continue to be disappointed in the writing ability of the authors. The first few books were good but it has been downhill since then. I found myself reading indwelllings just to make sure my assumptions about the assasin and everthing else were correct. Now that I find they are I wish I would have saved the money and gotten a one page synopsis of the book from someone. The writing level and suspense of the next book had better be taken to a higher level, otherwise this reader of all 7 books in the series has read his last Left Behind book."
4,A good addition to the series,"I absolutely love the Left Behind Series, I usually read every book the very same night I get it, I just can't put them down. I felt the same about this book, but I also think this is the weakest link in the series. The action in the book takes place over just three days, and while a lot can (and does) happen in three days, I felt while I was reading this book that the authors were just dragging it out as much as they could. This was probably so they could get another book out before they started the story of the Great Tribulation in the next book, The Mark. While I can't wait to read the next installment in the series, I can't help but feel that all that I learned in this book could have been condensed into the first two chapters of The Mark. Hopefully the next one will be as good as all the previous books (they are the reason I will forgive this one and keep on reading)."
1,dreadful,A relative wanted me to read this book and I have to say it's probably the worst book I've ever read.Very boring story that did not touch me in any way.
3,Thank God There's an Alternative,"I don't hate Left Behind. In fact, to begin with it looked like it might be a pretty good series. Now it just drags on and on with subplots and characters I find it hard to care about. There's HARDLY ANYTHING about the Tribulation. Thank God I heard about the end times series THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur. First of all, it sticks to the story. Even better, BeauSeigneur explains WHY and HOW the events of the Tribulation happen instead of just having them occur with no logical explanation."
4,A Must Read!,"The latest installment of the Left Behind series is a must read for anyone curious about Revelations and being ""left behind"" after the return of Christ. I have read all 7 books in the series and have given them to friends who do not share my spiritual beliefs and they have thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters. I would bet that it has caused a few to re-examine their priorities as well. The story is more detailed than the previous few books with a slow build towards the climactic end. I, for one, can't wait until book 9 in the Fall!"
5,Love these series,"I have been reading these series since book 1 (Left Behind) and it is just awesome. If you are just reading ""The Indwelling"" you must go back and read from the beginning. All I have to say is Glory be to God! Amen"
4,NICHOLAE RISES FROM THE DEAD,"Nicholae is dead, the victim of an assassination attempt that occurred in ASSASSINS, BL#6. The only question is who killed him? Rayford Steele or someone else? The authors tried so hard to persuade us it was Rayford, we were left to conclude it couldn't have been him. Here we learn we were right, it wasn't Rayford. Surprisingly, it was Chiam Rosenzweig. Yeah, the guy in the wheelchair. Apparently he was pretending, just to get himself in a position to kill Nicholae.But guess again, Nicholae isn't really dead! Some real suspense was built throughout this installment to lay the foundation for Nicholae's miraculous resurrection. Three days later, Nicholae rises during his own funeral and demands to be worshiped as a god. In actuality he has been indwelt by Satan himself, though that was not clearly spelled out.I will move onto THE MARK. This was some interesting reading and a good way to burn up a weekend."
3,Only Two Fall Short; And This Is One Of Them,"I wanted to love this book as much as the rest of the series. But the truth is, this one and Assassins really let me down. The series had relied on action, suspense, and great dialogue to carry it from its label as a simple-written novel; this book failed on all three. I still had to read this one - to stay updated on the series - but I didn't enjoy it much.I wish the authors could re-do this one, but I know that's not going to happen. All I can say is that with the exception of Assassins and The Indwelling the series is fantastic. As I stated earlier, some have called Jerry B. Jenkins writing style simple. Well sometimes ""simple"" can be fun. I don't want to have to search for the deeper meaning inside every author's head. If I want to do a crossword puzzle, I'll grab the newspaper. Fiction should be fun, and these books are fun and interesting. Plus they show God's love for us.Peace-out!www.therunninggirl.com"
1,Are you people brain-dead?,"I'm referring to the people who gave this book five stars and called it ""well-written."" It was just tripe and I'm sure the authors know it's tripe. I'm also pretty offended that some of reviewers imply that people who criticized the book are not ""good Christians."" We're criticizing men, not God."
2,Enough with this series already!,"I agree with a number of other reviewers that this series has stretched on way past where it should have stopped. The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible off of the series. I see no reason why &#65533;The Indwelling&#65533; and &#65533;Assassins&#65533; couldn&#65533;t have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward was rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well written, realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn&#65533;t need twelve books to tell a good story!"
5,AWESOME,"I have yet to read the book Indwelling but if its as good as the other 6 i cannot wait. Im 14 and right now Im on chapter 6 of the book Assassins...i started reading these books less than a month ago and i just got Appolyon tuesday[the 5 i think] and i finished it yesterday[thurday the 7th] these books are so awesome and soo true. If you havent read them yet,i encourage you to...they will change your mind forever:)"
2,The Tribulation Slows...,"After a brief bible study in Revelations, I didn't 'get' it. Someone suggested that I read the Left Behind series, and got to the first five books in two weeks. Assassins took another two days and just completed The Indwelling. While the series helps with the comprehension of Revelations, it is sad to see the commercialization of a very important message. Undoubtedly book sales will soar because you should read them in series to keep up. But what important happened in The Indwelling anyway? No meat in this book! Still the most important message remains: Don't get left behind! Praise God!"
2,A Disappointment,"After waiting so long for ""The Indwelling"" I was extremely disappointed. All 400 pages take place over one weekend, and I felt the entire story could have been told in a couple of chapters of another book. It seemed so long and drawn out! Normally I like detail, but Jenkins and LaHaye take it to a new level here! Credibility is stretched regarding David Hassid's computer capabilities, and how are they gonna fly a helicopter into Chicago if they're afraid to walk the streets? Still, I look forward to The Mark."
1,You've got to be kidding....,Am I the ONLY one who saw zippo in this book....I don't get it...page 365 we find out about the title....and there's only 385 pages in the book...365 pages of filler...extremely disappointed...what the heck gives?
1,Let's hope it's over,"Please, Christ, take them if they want it so badly... Just take them!Get this: either end up in heaven with billions of brain-dead sheep or burn in hell for all time... I think I'll get used to the heat...I would like to refute the childish arguments made in this book with some reasonable analysis but I understand that reason has nothing to do this so called book. Scary that 50 million books were sold. This is scary stuff... what does that say about the 5 million people who bought ten books each?"
4,Good book,"This was ordered as a used book and I recieved the book at the end of the estimated delivery window. It is a good book, unfortunately I read it out of sequence in the series, so some of the story line was lost. I will read it again once I read book 6."
3,Indwelling,"The book has slight water damage to the first couple pages, a tear in the cover, and yellowing pages. Not the best but nothing that would prevent me from purchasing from this seller in the future. Plus, you can't go wrong with the price!"
5,the indwelling,excellent book and the whole series is great really teaches you about the bible in a interesting way and is clean with no bad influences but it does put some fear in you as to how the final days will unfold
3,God please let me finish this series,"Ok, It's getting harder and harder for me to finish these books, I'm thinking that the whole trib force is going to witness the glorious appearing, seems they go thru a whole lot and only end up with bumps and bruises. I'm glad they left Hattie out, because her indecisiveness is getting on my nerves,and only God and the GC knows where she is and what she's up to. as for Rayford, he's starting to irk me as well. And all of the people that should probably stay (that seem to make the book interesting for a sec)...are getting killed off. Towards the end I just read the first part of each paragraph and managed not to miss anything that was going on. The authors should not be permitted to write another book for the series since it could've ended at least 5 books ago"
4,It was good but.....,"As all the other books, I coulnd't put it down. All these books have helped me in becoming a better Christian and I think that no matter what others have said about these books, they served the main purpose for which they were written. I know Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins had our spiritual growth and improvement in mind when they wrote these books. I loved it. The only thing I didn't like was that it moved to slowly. I was hoping the story would get a lot farther than it got. I recommend it to anyone, but read the others first (if you have not)."
2,Character development is non-existent!,"Chloe spends all of her time working for the international co-op. Those are pretty much the exact words of the authors. She's gone from a Main Eventer down to a Lower Mid-Card. So why should the audience care what happens to her? The reason for this is simple. It seems that for every one character that is killed, we are introduced to three more people that we will really never learn enough about to actually care. If the series continues down this path, I'll have no basis on which to recommend these books to others."
5,Left Behind,"Facinating, scary, and makes you think of how it would be if it happened this way in my life time, or rather ours. Makes you think of how you have lived your life and are worthy of not being Left Behind. Also helps you think and realize God in a different light. You start to reading and you can't put the darned books down. Good series. So, if your looking or checking out this series, you must be interested ... Go ahead and start reading ...."
3,"OK, but I'm afraid they are going to kill a good thing.","I'm a Christian and a big fan of the series but the series just isn't what it used to be. I feel like this book could have been told in about a hundred pages. There seemed to be a lot of filler material (Rayford remembering on the plane, a through explanation of almost everything). I still read the book all the way through and like everyone else I can't wait till the next one comes out. I really am starting to wonder how the writers are going to keep everyone interested for another five books. I just hope that they don't ruin what has been an excellent series. Does anyone remember Robert Jordan and his ""Wheel of Time"" series. It was good for the first couple of books, but with nothing happening and realizing there were six more books I needed to read just to be caught up, and still no end in sight of the series I abandoned it. Please don't do the same. Do we really need a twelve book series."
4,Edge of your seat reading,"They've done it again...another excellent, fast-paced book that I only put down to go to work! Excellent plot twists and a wonderful scene with Albie in charge! I did find myself thinking, ""Hurry up and get to the POINT already and get on with it!"" but true to the other books, the ""point"" as it were, didn't happen til the last several pages of the book, and leaves the reader hanging and waiting until NOVEMBER! I almost wish I hadn't discovered this series until all 12 books were written, so I wouldn't have to wait."
3,Good but pace is slowing,"This whole series is great. However, I am finding that the author is slowing the pace down. The author may see the dollar signs and try to drag the series on forever. I would recommend this series to everyone, especially non-christians."
1,Underlying basis for book series is unbiblical,"I would rated this a no-star but ya can't do that!This book (and all the books in the series) is based on the 'last days' madness infecting the large majority of the Christian churches in United States. Dispensationalism is what this book series is putting forth (in fiction form) and this belief system has largely been discredited biblically. (see www.prophecybooks.com) The major seminaries don't teach it anymore because it cannot be defended in a biblical and scholarly matter.If you want to learn some truth about God and the last days (or end-times), you won't find it here. If you just want some exciting FICTION, this book (and the series) will provide in double heapings (oh, the irony!)."
2,Disappointed,"This book failed in many ways to live up to the others in the Left Behind series, but I buy and support Christian authors. One new writer I read this weekend blew me away with her spiritual insight, wit, and ability to weave a spiritual mystery that kept me guessing to the end. The book is called a Force of Habit. It's a must read for those who enjoy Christian fiction."
2,switched to book-on-tape!,"I enjoyed the first three books immensly, but got bored by number four (they really are dragging this out aren't they?). I considered dropping the whole thing, but I didn't really want to do that either. Then I decided to rent it on tape and found that this is the way to go. It lasted three hours and made a dull trip very nice. This is how I plan to finish the series! PS - Cracker Barrel has a great thing going. You can rent books-on-tape for $3.00, and return it at any Cracker Barrel. They have a pretty good selection too. (Of course, the library is free!)"
2,The Longest Three Days,"Up until this book, I considered this one of the best series of books I had read in a long time. Since the ""Who shot J.R."" ending of the of the last book I have been waiting for the next in the series to arrive on the shelves. The one thing I have enjoyed in the other books of this series is the link to scripture and how it supports the writers interpretation of end times. This books did not flow with that same biblical support. Tsion having an out-of-body experience was really a stretch for the way he had used his wisdom and faith in earlier books. If the rest of the books in the series only cover three days each, it seems to me the authors are interested in making a great deal of money. I will buy the next book out, but if it is not written with the same passion as the first six books, it will be the last I buy."
2,MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT!,"After a very lengthy time of waiting for this new arrival, I was very disapointed as to the lack of prophecy, and the excessive useless dialogue that took place in this book. Not much happened, and aside from reading the very last chapter, one could theoretically skip this book and start with the next one without having missed anything critical. I think that the authors are starting to sell out. Big disapointment."
2,Action and Suspense were left behind,"The Indwelling could have been written in 25 or fewer pages without missing a beat. It was too much filler and fluff and not enough action. I have read all of these books and enjoy the biblical parallels; however, the fictional writing and sub-plot development leave much to be desired--like one more book that wraps up the story instead of 5 more!"
3,Mixed Thoughts,"I have enjoyed this series, but the last 2 have been a disappointment. I keep reading, cause I am hoping the next one will be filled with the quality of the first books.Also this may sound silly, but the publishers keep making the margins larger, and making the print bigger. Maybe it is becoming too commercial like one of the other reviewers said."
2,The Indwelling - a little slow,I must say I am a little disappointed in this book. It moved way to slow. The Assassin finished when they were just about to say who killed Carpathia. I expected the Indwelling to continue on from that point in time. I couldn't believe I had to read through half of the book to discover who did it. (Not that I didn't already know before I even started reading this book.) I still love the series and hope the next ones will pick it up a bit.
3,Long and Drawn Out,"As a big fan of the ""Left Behind"" series, I must express my huge disappointment with this book. It should have been called ""THE LONG-DRAWN-OUT WEEKEND BEFORE THE INDWELLING"". I enjoyed reading about all of my favorite characters, but truly, the dialogue was too detailed, and there was little real action. PLEASE, more plot and action next time; let's get on with it! The authors seen to have lost their focus on the biblical events and scripture. Sadly, if the remaining books are this tedious and drawn out, many will lose their interest in this fantastic series."
2,"Interesting story, horrible writing style","The subject matter is interesting, but the writers make it boring and annoying. The pointless dialogue, the repetition, the easy predictability. I skipped many pages of rambling, pointless dialogue and examinations of the characters' moral struggles repeated for the 98th time, and still knew what was going on. Here's some good writing advice: If it doesn't contribute substance to the book, leave it out. If the authors followed that advice, this book would be 30 pages long. For example, they could have easily left out all the verbal one-upsmanship between David and Guy Blod. What was the point of that?It's hard not to be distracted the ""technical"" screw-ups. The authors' overuse and misuse the past perfect tense of verbs (as in ""he had believed""). It also struck me when the Greek lady who knew so little English knew the English word ""fingerprints."" Get real. Those are just a few examples.It gets interesting in the last 20 pages. Skim the rest."
2,Please!,"If this is what passes for a good read these days, God help us all! If you want a book that covers the topic of the End Times AND is intelligent and thought-provoking to boot, read Glen Kleier's THE LAST DAY. It is the most entertaining novel ever written on escatological themes. It doesn't follow the predictable, mindless screed of these ""Left Behind"" lightweights. If you want some real End Days scare and fright, mixed with wit, humor and insight, read LAST DAY instead."
3,"Don't tell me the plot! Man, I hate when that happens!","I thought this was for reviews, not to find out who does what! I was reading through some of the comments and some knucklehead blurted 'I wasn't surprised that ______ was the murderer'. I'm still reading it, and now I know who the murderer is... Oh, well, I'll still read the series, but I agree that so far it's getting a bit drawn out. The first four I couldn't put down, 5 and 6 were kinda dry, now I'm on 7, so far it's nothing earth-shattering."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"AFTER WAITING SO LONG FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THIS BOOK, I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE AUTHORS WERE TRYING TO TAKE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN 50 PAGES AND STRETCH IT TO BE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE REST OF THE NOVELS IN THE SERIES."
3,The Saga Continues,"After reading all 7 stories in the Left Behind series, I must admit that Indwelling was a little slow. The series is informative and kept me excited from the first page to the last. However, some of the redundancy in the story drove me a bit crazy. Nevertheless, I am waiting with baited breathe for the next installment."
2,"I agree with the ""End-dwelling"" review","With the tribulation being 7 years and the thousand year reign to follow, I don't understand why the authors had to drag out 3 semi-eventful days in to an entire book. I actually used it to help me get to sleep at night. No more Left Behind books for me, I'm also going to wait for the movie."
4,Finally here!,"It was great to see the seventh book released. Although I really enjoyed the book and read it quickly, the authors are really dragging out the events. The entire book could have been covered in two or three chapters. Hopefully the authors will remember that quality over quantity is more important."
3,Too Slow,"Maybe because they announced the expanding of the series to more books, but it seems this one does not more the story along very far. I am an avid reader of the series; this one was the most perdictable and slowest. There are some shining moments like the description of the heavenly spiritual experience, but it did not grab me like the previous books in the series."
1,A Pilgrims Plodding,"In my life time I have read many fine books of this genre, and can safely say that this was one of the most predictable, pedestrian effort in the plotline, sophomoric dialog and witless characterizations I have ever encountered. For those who are addicted-get over it. For those who have not succumbed yet- do not bother, it is awaste of time."
2,Woulda coulda shoulda...,"I know about eight hundred other people have said this, but there is no reason whatsoever that this book couldn't have been combined with Assassins. There were no more than four events that absolutely needed to be said---everything else was literally filler. The writing is at its most pedestrian; the beginning has an extremely ham-handed reference to abortion (and I'm as pro-life as they get). Such an interesting part of the Revelation prophecy; the book could've been so much better than it was."
4,Jon,"I have read the entire series to this date. I have loved every edition that has come from this series. I look forward to the next installment of the left behind series. If you are a new Christian, or have been a follower of Christ all of your life, I recommend these books, as well as the soon to be released movie. I particularly liked to way the authors didnt try to ""interpret"" the book of Revelation. If the Bible says the moon will turn blood red, the the moon will turn blood red. Just read the book."
2,What a Stinker!,"I have just finished this book, after anxiously awaiting it's arrival for many months. I really hate that I have to say ""What a huge rip off!"" I feel like I've been hood winked. This book rambles on literally forever about all the main characters trying to get back to the same location, which if it were even the first quarter of the book, might have been ok. Then the very purpose and/or premise of the book, the Antichrist becoming ""indwellt"" doesn't take place until page 364 for a story that ends on page 389. I can't believe I looked forward to this book for so long! If the authors plan to abuse their readers with another non-story in the next installment,just to stretch how many books they can write, please don't even waste our time with the next one."
2,2800 pages too much...,"ok , so now 2800 pages into this story and most is pointless dialogue...wasn't this supposed to be a 7 book story? Stretching to 12 seems a money making ploy...am giving up...this is like a soap opera...you can skip books and still keep up..."
5,"ATTENTION TO ALL WHO HAVE READ ""THE INDWELLING""","This novel along with the previous books are brilliant! Before passing judgment on this book's content or the authors intentions please take the time to read some of these passages: (Tsion's Dreams)Acts 2:17 or Joel 2:28 (The Dream experience) Revelation Chapter 12 Thanks, A Fellow Believer"
1,"If you find these stories challenging, don't read this!","All you can say for this LEFT BEHIND series is that it makes for good Bible supplement, and if that's what you want in a reading experience, then, by all means have at it. But if you would like to engage your MIND on occasion; if you would like to read quality WRITING; if you appreciate intelligent PLOTTING and SUSPENSE, then you won't find it here. For the discriminating reader, there is a novel in this genre that delivers what this LEFT BEHIND pablum lacks. If you want your soul AND your mind stimulated, sit back on a dark night with Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY and enjoy some provocative thinking that is as scary as it is entertaining. As for LEFT BEHIND, unless your soul needs the reinforcement that badly, I say, leave it behind."
2,Disappointing,"After waiting so long to continue the saga of the Tribulation Force, this book was a MAJOR disappointment! I unfortunately think Mssrs. Lahaye and Jenkins are milking this very compelling story. By the time we find out who killed Nicolae, we have plowed through half of the book without really garnering any new information or inspiration. Finally, with a handful of pages left, Nicolae returns to life only to let down the reader. This crucial occurrence is sorely underdeveloped and rushed! All in all, this book is a complete yawner. I hope the authors get back to writing books that made this series so successful in the first place."
3,Series as a whole has too much filler time,I started with the movie and decided to see what all the hype was about. But I'm kind of insulted to see that these books have taken something spiritual and made it commercial. These books have an obvious formula. Keep you waiting for the next big climax by having Tsion predict it through out the book only to have it come at the end and kinda leave you hanging. Then recap during the next book and go through a bunch of stupid stuff till the next climax at the end of that book. The religious moments would be much better if these guys put more effort into character development. But since they don't I'm at the 8th book and I still don't feel connected to the characters or care too much about their salvation. A lot of stuff is implausible and since I don't want to ruin someone else's reading I won't explain. I have given the story 3 stars just because I am at the 8th book and I guess there's something that keeps me reading. Hopefully the ending will be worth it.
5,One of the best and sexiest songs ever recorded,"I first heard ""One Night"" over a year ago and have tried to find it everywhere. This is the only place I have even seen anything about it. I am beginning to think that there must be some litigation going on possibly explaining why it cannot be bought."
5,5 LITTLE PUMPKINS,I'm a music teacher in Cincinnati and this is such a cute book; one of my traditional favorites for Halloween. My Pre-Kindergarten through Kindergarten students love this tale and I've used it each and every year.Add this to your library!
5,Halloween Fun,I love this book. I read it to my preschoolers all month before Halloween and they never tire of it. The illustrations are just beautiful and very enjoyable for the children. The finger play rhyme in the book is very familiar to most of the children and they like to read along. They also enjoy voting for their favorite of the 5 little pumpkins. Very well done.
3,good starter tea pot,"This is a good starter pot, keeps the tea warm but the infuser holes are way to big! Other than that the teapot is good, suits its purpose."
3,Restocking fee ?,"I accidentally purchased 2 of the same item...,I wanted to return one but I would have to pay shipping and potentially get a restocking fee taken off what they would give me back.So I just kept it.The item is great I would buy it again but not from here.TY"
4,I wish I had invented this!,"I like this set. There is a nice progression from yellow to black. The units are solid and work exactly as they are advertised to. I can imagine someone who is very weak having a hard time with them as even the yellow device is a little heavy.The set is a little expensive, but if you are serious about exercise therapy for you fingers, this is a wonderful tool to help you achieve your goal."
4,DigiFlex finger exerciser,"I bought the set of 5 (without the plastic display stand) as an alternative exerciser for a hand strength problem following collar bone surgery. Good product, although frustrating when weak digits won't flex even the lightest (yellow) exerciser. Suggest using exercise putty first until some strength is developed, then DigiFlex exercisers. LEFT hand worked just fine!"
2,The worst expansion,"This seems to have been made for the fan base but for normal gamers it is of very little value.There are only 4 new scenarios included and no new figures but a few special rules.I recommend you give this one a miss and go for the much better and playable Pacific and Mediterranean instead, they bring new units and new playing style in a far better value for money box."
5,A must for synthetic organic chemists,"This is an impressive collection of 36 syntheses. Each chapter describes a different synthesis. Included are a retrosynthetic analysis(very helpful for those learning the art of total synthesis), the total synthesis(explaining key steps along the way and why the reaction gave the products it did) and then some conclusions. The appendix in chapter 22, on Catalytic Asymetric Reactions is very useful. If you bought ""The Logic of Chemical Synthesis' and were dissapointed, don't let that scare you from this book. It is well worth the price."
1,Takes Forever!,"We were happy with the gift baskets that were delivered. However the company only has one distribution center in California, which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast.Despite the company's ambitions to become a national company, they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California.This maybe great if you live in California. However I live in Florida and I ordered on December 22 and my basket did not arrive until January 4th. I think that would be unacceptable in anyone's view, espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive.Until this company gets with the program and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered."
3,Smart and useful,"You can read the synopsis and discover the highlights of 100 operas! So, it's a very useful book for an opera begginer, and not only."
3,Marillyn Monroe CD review,"I was a little disappointed, because on CD No. 2, nine tracks were repeated, from CD No. 1, therefore, I really only had 31 tracks, also on a few of the tracks, the quality was rather poor."
2,A film with great potential but feels flat overall,"The film has a great story, beautiful photography but unfortunately feels flat most of the time because the acting overall sucks. The director could have helped a few of the unprofessional actors go further but he did not. The main lead seems to have some potential but he too seems to have lacked good directing. The music was decent though could have been better at times. This was a natural candidate for openings in major fests like Toronto, Venice, Sundance, Locarno. This still remains a decent niche film that will reachaudiences interested in the sport but it could have reached a wider audience with better actors."
2,not what was expected,this product was very dissapointing the movie was very very short like 45min i watched the trailer and the featurett before i bought it which gave me very high hopes for the movie my advice is just watch the featurett it has all the good parts and it wont cost you 20bucks over all if your in to free diving dont get the movie .
1,"Disapointment from ""the greatr meaning of water""","I dive for many years now.I love diving and every thing that included in it.For years I'm looking for a moovy that will b a bit like ""The big Blue""When I saw that there is a moovy about free diving I thought it might be a bit like this moovy that I love so I bought it.What a mistake - instad of moovy about the joy in free diving I saw a dipressing moovy about illness that dosen't even look real since it dosen't seem possible for free diver to have sistic fibrosis.I got so dipressed from the moovy.If I knew I would never by it""Have Fun"""
1,Absolutly uninteresting,"I am really sorry,but speak about the big blue concerning this film is completely not appropriate.Only 5 minutes of this film takes place in the sea, all other is talking about the main character's life.He has some health problems and family problems and the film turn around these points....I dislike it, yet, I love all film dealing with apnea, sea, and other (even independent one) but this one is really not dealing with apnea.Bad film."
1,The Greater Meaning of Water,This movie was such a let down.I would not recommend any body purchase this dvd. The story was weak and acting was even worse. Maybe a low budget film but there is no way this movie can be compared to The Big Blue.Anyway please don't waste your money..
2,disappointing,"The good:- great cinematography- an honest and unpretentious storyThe bad:-less than 1 hour long-little underwater footage-feels very amateurish at timesAs a short I think this movie is a success, especially considering the $25,000 budget. However I found the move ultimately disappointing because it is more a story about a struggling athlete than it is about freediving."
3,Fantastic story! With some flaws however.,"Fantastic story! Delves into the depth and uncovers the bureaucratic corruption going on, on a daily basis on the hill, and around the globe among our so called leaders. Regardless if the story is completely true, based on a true story, or simply fiction, the moral however surly is true. And the world of espionage displayed in this writing sure reflects what the real underworld of intelligence is all about.The reason I chose to rate it with 3 stars only is because I believe the first 300 pages could have been written in 50. The later half of the book is indeed rich and interesting though. Also, the part with the women has nothing to do with the story and was simply added to add spice to the story. It is totally redundant. In summery, this book would have been more interesting, and would deserve at least one more star, had it been a 250-page paperback."
2,Slow,"This book was quite a letdown. I read his most recent book, Assassins, first and it was great. Exciting and riveting. This is the first book in the series and basically introduces all the characters you will see in the other books...slowly and with too much detail in some instances. Also, this book is filled with religous mumbo jumbo. I never realized Ollie was so religous. Assassins had a lot less religious stuff in it.You really don't need to read Ollie's books in order as Ollie is good at ""re-introducing"" characters in his other books so you aren't lost if you did not read the earlier ones. I would skip this one. I still look forward to reading the Jerricho Sanction and Assassins was great."
3,Para-Military or Religious Fevor,"This is an excellent para-militray/political story set within the Middle East and our ""War on terrorism"" that began in the ""cold war"". It is exciting and contains multiple conspiracies that involve the White House, United Nations, and special ops military to include Marine Force Recon, Army Delta and the British SAS. It does contain a few distractions that keep this from being a 5 star.First, the constant & long-winded discussions about one of the characters specific religious faith that permeates the book. It was excessive, and appears to be part of a personal agenda of the authors.The second distraction is some of the operational tactics are not correct. Specifically, Army Delta & SAS teams plan their own missions. In the book, the author treats them like he was leading a platoon of regular infantry, not experienced operators.Overall a good novel."
3,Gene,"Okay story. It reads as if it is his first book -- a bit pasted together. And, a bit shallow with concisely filling in his characters and plot. But, still an enjoyable read. I'm sure his skill will increase with his next books."
3,Not what I thought...,"I purchased this book in audio form for my cop husband and I to listen to on a road trip. Nothing on the packaging indicated this book was loaded with born again sermonizing. We did considerable fast forwarding on our little trip. The military and espionage stuff was entertaining, but as people who do not consider themselves a part of that particular religious circle we were dismayed to have paid money to be proseletyzed at without any warning. Foolish me. Next time I'll be reading the reviews on Amazon.combefore I invest."
2,Oh Pleeez. Is this a military suspense or religious novel?,"A very good military suspense novel, but I got very tired of North's Christian recitals, which I felt were beginning to be forced upon me. It seems like the only way the story could end was all the characters -- and I mean almost ALL the characters (who were not killed) had to be born-again Christians, and with their renewed faith in Christ were they able to overcome the enemy.I also felt a little cheated with how the authors ended the story. True to the movie format, you could almost see the ending fade out and the conclusions ""rolled"" like screen credits, like, ""well it's time to end the story, so let's just stop it here like this.""This was my first Oliver North novel. Would I read another one? I'll spend more time thumbing through it carefully before plopping down another eight bucks.Semper Fi,A former Vietnam Marine 1/9 ('67)"
5,Eye Opening From One Who Has Seen It !,Very believable after going through 8 years of the Clinton Administration !Even with all the backstabbing lying scum it Government it gives a person some hope that there are a few people in Government with some Character.Great to read a book without all the trash words.
1,mission aborted,I wanted to like this... I really did but I can't get past page 203. They haven't even left on the mission yet. The first 200 pages could have been edited down to 20 pages. I am going to use the worst word to describe an action thriller.... 'boring'.
2,I did not want to read a book about Christainity,"This was a fantastic military adventure ruined by the inappropriate constant references to evangelical Christianity. I bought this book because I have great respect for Oliver North and was looking forward to the military suspense and great adventure. Unfortunately, I was turned off by the constant religious overtones and hijacking of the plot to perpetuate religious views. I would have rated this book a perfect ten if it stuck to the plot, instead I feel I was duped in to reading a book that would be more appropriate for a Christian Science Bookstore than the Marine Corps Library."
1,Reheated tripe,"Probably not the last we'll hear from this lying, contemptuous of Congress cocaine-running weasel. If you really want to waste time reading this poorly written, self-aggrandizing drivel, go ahead, but don't say you weren't forwarned. North's adolescent fantasies of dare-doing and bravado are only matched by his meglomania and imagined self-righteousness. A real snoozer to boot. Wait for the Marvel Comics version, it's not far behind-"
5,A NOVEL?? You won't come up for air 'til the last page!,This is the most exciting book I have EVER read! How can this be a novel? If there is even a SHRED of truth to this...this will be a MUST READ for EVERYONE! When is the sequel coming out?
4,Ollie North hits a homerun!,"Ollie North hits a homerun!The first-time novelist, North, grabs hold of the reader from page one and doesn't let go until the end. This novel has it all...intrigue, suspence, danger, action...the makings of a HIT novel followed by a HIT movie! Col. North shows all, that he is indeed, a wonderful story teller. This ability, I am sure, comes from his ""life experiences"".It is wonderful how he was able to write a suspence novel which tells a story with an underlying message within...the message of everlasting life through Christ Jesus, attesting to Col. North's own personal relationship with our Saviour.Congratulations, Col. North!Don't hesitate, buy this book NOW!!!"
3,Inclusion of the author makes it interesting,"This is a fairly good book. The plot is good, but enhanced by the timeliness of the setting - Hussein's Iraq and UN involvement. The characters - especially the bad guys are not very convincing.North's own involvement in the plot gives it a nice twist. It also makes much of the background material more believable - one must imagine that Ollie knows much about his topic. I actually thought the book was made more intriguing by deciphering North's barely hidden agendae.Lastly, be prepared for, but not offended by, a few chapters of fundamentalist Christian proselytizing. A bit more of North's agenda thrown into the mix.All in all an amusing spy/thriller with good hard current events thrown in. Worth the read."
5,An eye opening and thought provoking book.,"The title itself speaks to the truth. It is a ""heroic path"" that one must take in order to really try to find oneself, get to know oneself. My eyes were opened going into this book, but I had no idea how much more there was to know, learn and understand. Angela Trafford is a spiritual teacher, who has a wish and a hope for all people to find the love within themselves and each other. There were several times throughout the book, when I thought the author was speaking directly to me. She has a great understanding of the human spirit."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Visitants is a bit of a comedy, if a quiet one at times. He makessome subtle and not so subtle fun of things like Wicca and fantasy. Themain character is an average ordinary bloke who gets caught up in crossworlds travels, adventures, faery and tries to relate to the odd womanalong the way. Softly amusing."
3,The Clipper Returns,"This is a so-so movie with excellent views of period aircraft and airborne photography. The movie is a fictionalized version of Juan Trippe's founding of Pan American Airways and its expansion across the Pacific. Excellent photography of the original Martin M-130 China Clipper and of it flying over San Fransisco while the Oakland Bay Bridge was under construction. If you are a fan of period seaplanes and flying boats, add a star to the rating.The Movie appears to be a very good copy of a very good original print. It does not appear to be cleaned up or remastered, but image quality is very good. I was disappointed that there were no special features or historical data other than the 1936 movie trailer."
4,'Inspired House' Inspiring,"'Inspired House' introduces you to the owners, architect and builder of the featured homes, giving insight into the ideas behind design and building decisions. Good look at how your house could move from vision to concept to reality. The houses here seem more livable, more affordable (for the most part) than some in similar books. If you're hoping for nuts-and-bolts costs and dimensions, this book will leave you mildly disappointed. But the lovely, practical homes are well worth looking to for inspiration, and that, after all, is what was promised. A wonderful book that actually did inspire and fill out many details of our current ""if we build"" home."
3,Owner Builder ideas,A broad coverage of designs. A little flashy and cold. Lots of photos illustrating ideas and floor plans.
4,Good value-for-money,The word lists and the Sample tests are what make this book worth its money. The advice given while 'guessing' in the verbal section is good too. I particularly like their style of attacking the reading comprehensions.
2,Large Book of Generic Test Taking Stratagies,This book is basically simulated test questions. Most of the strategies are common sense or are covered by every other SAT prep book on the market. Small font is also a nuisance. I'd suggest looking to another company for a book for test tactics and ordering the 10 real SATs book for non-simulated problem review since many of these books use answer choices and question that the ETS would never use.
1,You're kidding right?,"Other books have real test taking techniques. Here are Barrons: Keep track of the time; fill in the answers on your answer sheet (really?); don't make stray pencil marks; read choices before choosing an answer; etc., etc. DUH! The practice tests are ok and helpful, but every book has those. Teach me how to get a good score!!!"
2,Vocab. Cards,"I would just like to say that while the book is useful and good and all that, the flash cards at the back are worthless because THEY HAVE THE WRONG DEFINITIONS ON THEM!"
5,Love this game-- all ages,"It took a while to get the scoring and the strategy down, but my 8-year old and I would list this among our favorite games. Our family is a BIG fans of most all of the Gamewright games, but this one in particular manages to put an 8-year old and a 40-year old on the same playing field, so to speak. In fact, he has learned to take advantage of me by switching ""Land vs. Water"" positions every other game so that I become confused whether I'm trying to build ""islands or ponds."" Get the game. You'll learn what I mean."
3,A difficult book for beginners,"I'll admit that I'm a beginner in the study of Gnosis, and over estimated myself when I ordered this book. After reading snippets of it, like I would the bible, I realized that I was nearly in over my head. This book is confusing. Many others who I've spoken to have advised that one reads many books about the Nag Hammadi findings before they read the actual findings. They couldn't be closer to the truth. Besides the fact that it's confusing, it's a common Gnostic belief that you must learn from a teacher before learning on your own.On that note, despite how useful this book is. I'd advise anyone, at all interested in the subject matter, to first look for books by Elaine Pagels and Stephan Hoeller, first to get an idea of what you can expect to actually be reading."
3,"For the Scholar, not the inquisitive.","The publication is faithful to the text but to get very far in the readings, one really has to be a scholar. One really gets weighed down in the annotations and markings left in the text and though I've studied ancient Greek and am familiar with having to reconstruct meaning from a partial text, I'd much more appreciate someone sitting down and attempting a plain English version with the guesses to missing words or passages clearly marked."
4,religion,"A reference book on religious history. For those who are enlightenedand educated on Judaism and Christianity, because this is to deep forthe average lay person."
2,"For scholars, not seekers","The Word is spiritual, not physical. Those who hope to gain wisdom from it must approach it as spiritual, not as a literal physical object. And, that is the problem with this work. James Robinson is a renowned scholar who has gone to great pains to provide accurate translations of the Nag Hammadi scriptures. But, there is little food for the soul here.If you are a scholar, this is the book for you. But, if you are a seeker of spiritual truth, look elsewhere. I am a seeker and have owned this book for many months. I would not miss it if it disappeared from my personal library.Seekers are advised to look elsewhere, starting with the older writings of G.R.S. Mead."
3,Chest Lock,This is a good CHEAP lock. Cheap being the key word. Buy a better one if your going to be using it a lot.
5,Loved this book,I recently purchased 3 books on decorating guest rooms and this one is by far the best of the bunch. The photos are just beautiful and I will use many of the ideas found here.This book will become a favorite on my shelf and I would recommend it.
2,Not worth the investment. Borrow it from the library instead.,"Completely setting aside my dislike for the author's decorating style (too poofy, too theme-y, at times too busy and crowded), there simply is not enough information here to be worth the cost of the book. It is basically a coffee table book. Large photographs of rooms dotted with text."
5,Occult and magick is a joke not this DVD,"I have most of Steve's DVD Attunements and they do work and pass the Attunements and are not jokes. If you want to take advice from a person from who admits practicing the occult and magick and wants you to read an occult book that's up to you. Reiki is your life force, it's not the occult or magick. It is also interesting the reviewer says long distance Attunements work, but of course he does not like the method Steve uses. The date of the review speak for itself about its content, April fools Day."
5,"Buy it, you will be glad you did!","My husband and I watched the video together and received the attunement. We both experienced the energy, but different things happening in our hands. His was hot smooth sensation and mine was hot and pulsing. He said the crystal became three dimensional (in the room) and glowed different colors for him. I want to thank Steve for making film and hope he continues to make more."
1,disappointing,"You stare at a crystal with music playing...for 15 minutes. Seriously, that's the highlight. I'm going to have to sign up for a class because this taught me nothing...made me feel nothing...I viewed this video with my mother in law, a level II Reiki and even she didn't get anything from it. After it was over we just looked at each other and went...huh? That's it?Very disappointing."
3,Incomplete training introduction,"Be aware that this video ONLY provides an attunement session and then some illustrations of various hand positions. It does NOT provide a thorough explanation of Reiki or show how to do it. For that, you would need to purchase a separate book. Steve Murray's hand gestures while speaking in the introduction are awkward and distracting, making me want to just get that part over with. The attunement from Sedona was beautiful, but I wonder how an energy attunement can be transmitted via looking at a TV screen. I guess this was cheaper than paying for an attunement, but I still feel like I need a class or other guidance before I will feel comfortable trying Reiki. After watching the video, I was left with more questions and doubts than confidence in this system."
1,What a joke!!!,"I've studied magick for years and I'm a member of an occult order...please, stay away from this DVD!!! It's a joke and a waste of money!! If you want to feel the energy and use it for yourself and others, try reading some occult, like Golden Dawn teachings. If you want to deal with Reiki go get a proper attunement...staring at an image on a DVD it's not what I call attunement..it's not even an initiation. Long distance attunements would work but not like that. Where is the participation? Where are the visualizations necessary to receive any kind of energy? If you value your money and your time, stay away from this product. Much love and light"
1,Waste of money,"I was getting ready to take a Reiki class but after seeing this DVD, forget it. It really explains nothing about the concept behind Reiki and the childish paintings of the hand positions ment very little. They could have at least shown a ""real"" attunement for the money."
1,a total waste,"I have bought numerous books and tapes on alternative health matters: Reiki, aromatherapy, yoga, tai chi, etc. I was looking forward to gaining some information, if not insite, to the practice of Reiki ( I just finished a very good book on it). This was the most useless item I ever purchased. For $34.95 you are told to put your hands in prayer position, raise them over your head, lower them, open them, breathe in, breath out. You are attuned. And oh, yea, it ends with cartoon drawings showing hand postions for Reiki treatments but with nary a word of instruction or explanation. If I could return it i would."
1,unhappy customer,"I found this a disappointment after a lot of study, I chose this as the way for my attunement as I can not attend the reiki school in Orlando. It was not only a big fat zero it made it difficult for me to do my regular energy exercises."
1,are you serious?,"Don't waste your hard earned money on it!!!!This is a piece of crap and does not show you anything about the Reiki mindset, hand positions, why learn Reiki etc.You can not learn Reiki by watching a video, people!!!!I have been a Reiki Master-Teacher in 3 different Reiki modalities. If you are serious about learning something that WILL help to grow, then your best option is to take at least the Reiki I class through a professional and skilled teacher"
5,Thank You ! Steve,"Thanks to Steve Murray for making available to all who seek this, an affordable system that works. I have recieved all three levels of attunement and My life is truly changed for the better. Not to mention the great change in my massage practitioners business. I offer Reiki with the massage for a total experience. The DVDs and The Book are wonderfull. Easy to follow and read. Anyone interested in Reiki should buy these."
3,Hoping the DVDs get better,"I'm open but so far the DVDs don't have a lot ""meat"" to them. Steve Murray is a very good, clear narrator/speaker and has great presence. There is a good amount of recycled material in the DVD. I would have felt better paying about $10 for each DVD I purchased. I'm going to try a couple more and get myself inline with what should be coming through."
3,Cat-Opoly,"This game is awesome! I learned a lot about money, cat breeds, real estate, and life when I played. It is also a lot of fun. But, like Monopoly, it can get boring. The ""money"" tears easily and the plastic banker trays are large and in the way. I've also noticed that the Cat-Opoly game doesn't come with as much ""money"" as the Parker Brothers Monopoly. But I still give it two thumbs up. Even my mom will play with me!"
4,Game about Cats,"I got this game for a christmas present for my husband. We have several monopoly games and we just needed a change from the hotel motel thing. This shows you different breeds of cats on the board, and interesting facts about them. Its fun to play this game even though you are playing with fishbones and cat nip.... Hours of fun. We enjoy this on Saturday nights when Netflix is not in our living rooms. Enjoy!!!!:)"
4,Fun and cute,I bought this for my friend for Christmas who loves cats. We played it 3 nights in the first week he opened it. It was really cute. The only odd thing I noticed was the litter boxes were little round cork looking pieces.
2,NOT AMUSING !!!!!! DO NOT BUY IF NOT OBSESSED WITH CATS !!!!,"If your kids abouve the age of 9 or so and their not obsessed with cats, then i dont think you should get it for them. when i got mine from my aunt, i decided to take it back[because it wasn't to amusing],instead i got a t-shirt at abercrombie and fitchwhich i absolutely loved!!!!"
1,"Oh Richard, How Could You?","If you love the songs here as much as I do, don't buy this CD! I typically like Clayderman, but on this one he plays everything in the key of eeeeeeeeeek. I don't know what he was shooting for, but he ruins every single song. On our one (and only) listen-through, my husband and I sat here asking ""What IS that song, and what is he DOING to it?""If you treasure these songs, stick to the originals. Otherwise, you'll be angry you spent the money and never listen to the songs the same way again."
3,a different novel,Nadya is different to all the other stories I have read. It's about an adolescent who ends up alone and she has to travel west.She's different to all the other girls because she's a werewolf. I recommend it to adolescent children
1,A yucky book,The summery from the back and first page gave me a totally different idea of what the book was all about. All it is is a book about a homo-sexual female that turns into a wolf every now and then. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends.
5,Powerful helpf for children and adults,"This little book explains a very important issue for children and adults-you are allowed to have feelings. It shows a charmingly drawn little guy who progressively covered up more and more of his feelings when they became inconvenient for his parents and others. But, one day he made a friend who told him ""I'm not really like you...My tough and anger are only patches to hide my fear and lonely."" Very powerful."
1,No Sample Songs,"I would love to send a review, but without the ability to hear the songs, I can't. Why so some albums (CDs) offer sample song listening and other not?Thank you.Peter Ripley"
3,"Output in RGB, not YPbPr","This adapter works ok, but it outputs in RGB color, not the YPbPr that my Philips HDTV needs. Make sure it works with your TV's color space first! Other than that, a decent product."
3,Dual Link only!,Be sure you have a Dual Link Capable DVI port or this simply won't work. (no Mac mini)
3,Didn't work for my Macbook Pro,"I think the unit itself may be fine, but it will only work for some types of ATI cards. Please be sure to check the specs and ensure you have the proper Graphics card that will work with this unit. It did not work on my Macbook Pro Intel Core Duo (32 bit) with the ATI Radeon X1600 graphics card."
1,Be very careful,"This will not work with all ATI cards (as I found out :( ) It seems like a good adapter, its just my 3000 series ATI card is not compatible. I get absolutely nothing on the screen."
1,Poorly described,This is a dvi-i (dual link product). Will only work with dual link dvi-I components. Item is not well described which led me to a waste of money. Product was listed as dvi std but did not tell which of the 3 standards it was. Product was a good price but is not worth head ache and money of return.
2,Took a gamble,"I wanted to connect my computer (from video card) to first generation HD Big Screen TV (the old big block big screens, the tv has 1080i component input).My computer's video card has presets for tv out put, 1080i, 720P.... all with the hrz presets... Any way i dont know if it is the TV or the video card, but when i can get the video over to the TV (which was few and far between,) picture was bad, faint, fuzzy, and off...Again not sure if me or the cable...Not the best test environment for the product."
5,Emotive and rewarding,"Great stuff. Reminds me of some of Peter Gabriels's or Paul Simon's experiments in making accessible popular music with multi-cultural flavors. Highlights include the heavy acoustic riffs on ""Thaw,"" the spacious, middle-eastern arrangement on ""Alive,"" and the really beautiful melody of the title track. Kate Bush fans will love this version of The Morning Fog."""
2,Poor Design,"I was looking for a small teapot to make one large cup of tea with loose tea leaves. The Brown Betty seemed to be the perfect answer. The design of the spout, however, causes the loose tea to accumlate and plug the spout when pouring. This result is the tea flowing out the top. I thought the British would design a better teapot than this one.I gave a two star rating only because it is cool looking teapot."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!,"Even though this review is past the band's break-up, my friends put this cd in and i was just amazed by what i heard. The melody of the music just sounds so great. I took like 20 min and downloaded all their cd's of the internet, it was soooo good. My favorite song is ""Flaying Horses"" because the dummer with the dums and harmonica just amazes me. I urge you to get these cd's!!!"
5,amazing,"there are very few cds in my collection that i can honestly say i would never get sick of listening to, and this is one of them. every single track on this cd is incredible. for every mood you could be in, there is a song right for you. people are a little aprehensive about independent bands because theyre not plastered all over tv and magazines, but dispatch far exceeds any mainstream band. people say that they sound like old dave matthews band, which i could agree with to an extent. but if you arent into the dmb sound, that doesnt mean you wont like dispatch. the best tracks on this cd are bridges, elias, and flying horses. i also recommend guster, oar, granian, and graham colton if you like dispatch"
5,A truly amazing album,"I own over 200 albums from many different genres of music, many of which are very good, but 2 of which are clearly above the rest. One of them is Dave Matthews Band Live at Redrocks Disc 1, and the other is this Cd. This is the greatest acoustic cd ever. The chord progressions are simple but work perfectly with the three part harmonies and the solos. All the tracks are exceptional, I would recommend all of them. Hey Hey and Bridges are two of my favorites. Buy this album if you enjoy good music, you won't be disapointed."
3,Interesting Read...Many Inaccuracies,"Marks makes a number of technical inaccuracies. If you want to see if you're interested in Russian culture but don't know much about it, get this book from the library. Personally, I was inspired to learn more about anarchy and anti-semitism from this book. You won't need it again, and you shouldn't cite this book as a source, because Marks is mostly using secondary sources, which you'll need to read yourself. The general ideas that you get from this book will probably be fine, but if you want to follow up on some of the ideas, find a book that's more focused on the area in which you're interested. Additionally, Marks makes a number of unsubstantiated generalizations that he doesn't back up; this would be fine if the book weren't meant for beginners, who won't understand where he's coming from."
5,Awesome music!!,This music is perfect for anyone that enjoys religous music and this would appeal to all ages too.
5,soup spoons are hard to find!!,I have been looking for soup spoons for months. I was thrilled to finally find them at a reasonable price. They are nice quality and the design is simple enough to use as casual or formal. The company was easy to work with and I had no issues regarding shipping/handling. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,Unsatisfactory,"This is the first item I have had to return. I did so because it was not as I expected based on the reviews it had received online prior to ordering. The spoons were made in China. The bowls of the spoons were shallow and in trying one , the metal made my tongue tingle and tasted odd.Maybe I received something other than those ordering previously. I cannot recommend these. One last point, the vendor shipping these did not comply with the Prime agreement of 2 day shipping."
2,Slurpin',"These soup spoons arrived from Canada in tact in a timely fashion albeit an almost $18. shipping charge. They are ""plain Janes"" but will serve the intended purpose. Oneida spoons would have been a better choice."
1,Disappointed,I was looking for heavy duty soup spoons and was excited to find these. They arrived promptly. I was disappointed that the bowl of the spoons had edges that seemed sharp. I was afraid someone could cut their lips as they put the spoon in and out of their mouth. I think the edges should have been smoother/softer.
5,Great spoons,I was skeptical when I ordered them thinking that they were going to be cheap quality because the price was so low but was pleasantly surprised when I received them (just a few days after ordering them). These spoons are great! They are very nice quality and simple enough to match up to any set.
5,Soup Spoons,We were unable to locate round soup spoons in local stores. We purchased this set onthe Web and they were just what we wanted.
2,Battery opporated trains,"I purchased this Thomas Round House set for my son and have had many problems with the battery opporated trains working correctly. 1st - the trains cannot climb the second tier, 2nd - trains run off the track on the 4 most outer corners, and 3rd - the poor quality of the tracks have rounded edges which allow the trains to run off the tracks.I have purchased two other sets and not had the problems like the Round House Set. Payed to much money for poor quality..."
4,Works as advertised,"Mount works out well now that it is mounted, a little more difficult to install than anticipated and I am pretty mechanically inclined. I am not sure why exactly I had issues when the directions made it sounds so simple, but I had some factory skid plate that was just slightly in the way. It sure wouldn't hurt if the U-bolts were just a half inch longer either. But all in all, it does exactly as it is designed and my plow is mounted and it is very well built and sturdy."
1,Only for young children,"I bought this game for my 10 year old son. Well he was way too old for it. We both found the game extremely boring and non-educational. The questions about the color, the accessories the states are wearing and the faces on the states have absolutely nothing to do with learning about states. I guess it may be fun for children under 6, but other than that save your time and money."
4,Great for Grandparents to play with the kids.,"We played this with our 10 year old Grandson. He loved it and kept wanting to play again. Good way to learn where the states are located, and entertaining at the same time."
4,Blue Knights,"This is the neglected big screen version of Joseph Wambaugh's landmark novel and it holds up really well. The format shifts from that of the book as I recall it, and instead of following three rookies as they come on the force we mainly get a dual portrait of an old-timer and one of the newbies. There are some effective episodes and the filmmakers are ahead of the curve in depicting the underlying racial tensions of the L.A. streets. (Although these scenes are diluted a bit by some of the stereotypes of the performances.) The two leads are very effective though. Keach carries the picture with his intense earnestness and Scott's final scene is one long take that's a knockout."
4,A good cop story for the time it represented.,This was and still is a good movie for the time frame it represented. I saw it when it was new in 1972 & it ran on TV for many years. It presented itself as a capsule of good cops & bad cops & some in between just trying to do their job in an element that they felt overwhelmed in. It's still a good story if you are interested in the 60's & 70's street cop experience.
3,The New Centurions,I hadn't seen this movie for over 30 years. Given that it's over 40 years since this was made the story line is still credible.Quite enjoyed watching it again. Recommended.
3,Run-Of -the-Mill,A run-of the-mill and highly predictable police saga with lots of stereotypes and few surprises. Minorities and women are not portrayed in a particulary flattering way.
3,"Bitter, Controversial, Authentic","I had read the book in addition to seeing this movie and was somewhat disappointed.The book had been equally about three Los Angeles police officers, Serge Duran, (Erik Estrada), Gus Plebesly (Scott Wilson) and Roy Fehler (Stacey Keach). The movie primarily focuses on Roy Fehler and leaves very small roles for Gus and Serge, whose characters were important in the story.In spite of this, it was still a good movie that was educational and entertaining. George C. Scott was great in the role of Kilvinsky and was exactly as I pictured the character. The movie evolves around day to day situations from petty crimes to violent crimes.The ending is sad. I don't want to give that away, but the best part was when Erik Estrada prays the Hail Mary in Spanish, which makes the movie more touching than any I have seen.I recommend this movie for anyone who likes cop movies."
2,I really like Elton Johns music,But the sound quality on this cd was so poor I don't like to listen to it! Was it always this way? LOL
5,Illuminating and fascinating,"This is an eminently readable piece of scholarlship. The information is well-organized, well-expressed, and utterly fascinating. Congratulations to the author. Well done!"
1,WRONG MODEL - NOT CLEAR FROM DESCRIPTION,THIS CARAFE DOES NOT WORK WITH THE DCC 1100 MODEL MAKER. IT IS NOT CLEAR AT ALL FROM THE DESCRIPTION THAT YOU MUST CHECK THE MODEL NUMBER OF THE MAKER. WASTED A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT RETURNING IT.
3,Cuisinart Carafe,"The product was received on time and in excellent condition. It was exactly what I ordered, so I have no complaint about that. The problem was, I ordered the wrong item. I needed a different product number. Unfortunately, Amazon won't allow exchanges. I would have just returned it and replaced it with the correct item, but in stead I had order a second carafe from another company, so it ended up costing me twice as much since I had to buy two. The mistake was entirely mine. I was just disappointed that I couldn't fix my mistake through Amazon. It definitely means that I will think twice before using Amazon again."
5,Great Deal,"I purchased a ""refurbished"" carafe for $8.94. It was sealed in it's orginal box and was perfect. I still don't know what was ""refurbished"" about it. If I had to pay $15 to $25 for a new carafe I would have considered just buying a whole new coffee maker."
2,Size Choice,"The choice of the size should be more clear. I've got the watch, but in a wrong size. There is not a field where you can choose the size of the product, and there is no indication of the size of what you bought at the end of the purchase."
3,Muy pequeño...,"Se ve muy sencillo, lo compré para regalo y no me satisfizo, no lo recomiendo es sumamente pequeño. No le doy menos estrellas por consideración a la empresa que da muy buen servicio."
5,Real Good piece of Flatware,Very sturdy and elegant pieces. I have them for daily use. They fit well within my fingers(medium sized fingers). I have rated them 5 stars(extra star) not only for the product but also for the excellent customer service of Amazon. I had some issues with shipping and the Amazon guy handled it so well that it was a very good experience.
5,Great Flatware!,"I've had this set of flatware for 5 years now and still love it as much as this first day I received it. Like the other reviewer I wanted a set of silverware that was easy to hold in the hand, wasn't over adorned and was thick enough to hold up over the years without bending. This set has done all those things. I absolutly love it."
3,"Built like a tank, but weird shape of spoons","Exceptional fit, finish and quality. These are absolutely non-bendable, yet they do not feel super heavy (they have heft however). Made in Japan, which is very unique these days.The problem - weird shape, especially the spoons. raised back of the spoon bowls acts as a bumper against your lips. While deep, the table spoon does not hold more than average spoon. Also the shape makes it difficult to grab soup/liquid where there is little of it left in the bowl. The knife is also bit weird being very short. It has a nice hollow handle though (made of 18/8 steel like the forks and spoons). And teaspoon as in majority of non-European designed sets is simply too big.So check if the shape works for you. We decided that even if we get used to the shape, the looks is not timeless (kinda rustic) and we will grow tired of it."
4,Applicable to Men too!,"Thanks to Ms. Marie for writing a down to Earth, no holds barred book. The frank and bluntly honest manner in which the information is presented is a breath of fresh air in a sea of self-help publications. The stories hit strangely close to home. The highs and lows of this book were reassuring that the issues of my family and I are not isolated. Recovery, sobriety and the positive sides of life are indeed possible after all. Great reading for all adult members of the affected family. Terrific work!"
5,Good Buy,Seems like a quality air hose for the money. I have used it for a couple of weeks on a construction site and has held up well.
5,Great Value,Economical hose with necessary attachments. Seems rugged enough for any home handyman's uses!
3,Good product for price...,This air hose is a very good product at a good price...A little stiff on recoil but very functional...I am satisfied with it's performance...
1,I can't rate the BLACK hose.,Received BLUE hose#PA1178! Expected BLACK rubber because of the picture.We were very surprised.
2,I'm a Marrs Fan.....But not on this one.,"This is an interesting topic but I just didn't think it hit the mark. Marrs has always delivered with his books such as: Crossfire, Alien Agenda, and Rule by Secrecy. However, I found it difficult to stay interested. In any case, if the topic interests you maybe this book is for you but I think his best work was already done."
2,interesting synopsis,"I have this book and Jim Mars is a very interesting speaker, but the book left out a lot and timelines were way off. It seems only to be from the viewpoint of Ingo Swann, no real information about the military remote viewing programs."
5,very informative,"I am still not finished with the book. So far, what I have read confirmed other books I read on the subject and more. I really enjoy his style."
3,"Love the color, but hard to apply.","I got this color at a nail salon and loved it so much that I came home and bought it immediately. The reason I didn't rate it higher is because I found it thinner than polished I normally use and therefore, harder to apply. Also, because of the thinnest and the dark color, I have to apply 3 coats to make it look good. This also results in a slightly darker color than the original. I do love the look once done and it last very well without too much chipping so if you're willing to take your time, I do recommend this color."
5,"Just buy it, you'll love it for life!","This is just a wonderful book, even for non-veggies. Its one of those books you want to spend an afternoon on the couch with, like an armchair traveller. Its not only beuatifully edited in a logical, well thought-through way, but the recipes itself are all simply delicious, having tried now about 20 of them. Even if I intend to cook sth quick just for myself I turn to the book for inspiration.."
5,An Adventure in Taste,"The silk road from China to Italy traverses an unbelievable diversity of cooking styles and tastes, yet Najmieh Batmanglij somehow manages to conquer this complexity. All of the recipes are well-developed, creating dishes with the full flavor and aroma one would expect if each night one walked into a Persian, a Turkish, Indian or even Thai restaurant.The book is lavishly illustrated with pictures and stories from the regions of the recipes. Although broadly diverse, the cooking of Batmanglij's native Iran is exceptionally well-represented.The recipes themselves are easy to follow, but not intended for the casual cook. Pomegranate juice, rose water, pistachios and saffron are common, but a prepared cook will find the rewards worthy the effort and expense. It has been a delightful change for my carnivorous family to reduce our meat consumption and enliven our larder."
2,It Was Different,"It wasn't the worst book I've read,but it wasn't the best book it was just different.The begening was good(and a little funny) but than at the end it almost got a little scary.You should judge this book for yourself you might have a few different reactoins......But like I said before it was different."
4,"Two boys, One town, One river, and alot of TROUBLE.","The author of Swear to Howdy is Wendelin Van Draanen. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat and you wouldn't want to stop reading it. Swear to Howdy is very comical. This book has some depressing and sad things that happen. A boy moved to a small town called Lost River which was named after the river that the town is near and his name was Russell Cooper. He made good friends with his new next door neighbor Joey Banks. Both Joey and Russ had sisters who were cruel. Their names were Amanda Jane, Joey sister and Jenna Mae, Russ's sister or ""sissy"" as everyone calls her. Joey and Russ didn't know that this was going to be the most tragic summer of their lives.I liked this book because it is funny and it kept me on the edge of my seat when I read it. I think this book is mainly for teens but younger children can read it as well as adults. This book made me think things through before they act."
5,Wow! This is a really great book!,"The book Swear to Howdy by Wendlin Van Draanen was really interesting. It had me wanting to read another chapter everytime I quit reading, and it had a lot of drama in it. Joey and Rusty are best friends and they lived next door to each other. They both had an older sister, and they were the same age, and they were best friends. Rusty and Joey were always trying to do something to their sisters. One night they wanted to do something and they went to far.I really liked the book a lot. It is probably for teenagers and adults because they would understand it more. This book made me realize that you should think before you do something and make sure it won't hurt anybody."
2,So Very Predictable,"I read this book as a teacher; it is a South Carolina Junior Book Award Nominee for the upcoming school year. I must say that I LOVED Flipped and was eager to read the next book by this author. However, the plot was mediocre and predictable (I saw the climax at least a few chapters into the novel.) and the characters were flat. Van Draanen had sketchy details, relied too heavily on unique Southern expressions to carry the book (most of which fell flat), and the characters themselves are not motivating or interesting. This was a great disappointment."
4,A Book Review by Rettis,Swear to Howdy is by Wendelin Van Draanen. There are two boys named Joey and Rusty. They go and do crazy and funny things. The genre is realistic fiction. The problem is Joey is trying to get Rusty to do some pranks and stuff with him. What happens Russell just moved in Joey's neighborhood? They went to a water hole and started swimming every day. Then Rusty and Joey put some bugs in the drinks their sisters were passing out to people at a game to get them fired. I wouldn't recommend this book for kindergarteners up to fourth grade because of the bad language.
4,Youve got to read this!!!,"Swear to Howdy by Wendelin Van Drannen is a funny, dramatic, thriller. The book takes place in the present time and in a small town. There are two boys that are best friends. They do everything together. They pull pranks on their older sisters, they shoot guns, they swim at the river together. Until something devastating happens and they stop hanging out.I thought it was a good book. Because it was so real like when they went to swim at the river, hang out all the time , and pull pranks. It is for boys and girls over thirteen because people that are too young usually cant relate to some things that happen.From this book you will learn how much you should enjoy your life and family because it can be gone in a snap."
4,humor lesson,"Swear to Howdy by Wendelin Van Draanen is a book about two boys named Joey and Rusty who are always playing tricks and getting into trouble like plinking and swapping fish. But when something tragic strikes, it haunts them forever. There is a reason why Joey keeps secrets from his dad. It is because his dad has a temper problem.I like this book because it teaches about friendship and sometimes you keep secrets no matter how bad they are.by Brent"
5,Excellent quality,"GP50 3-Piece Junior Children's/Kids Starter Drum Set with Hi-Hat Stand - Metallic Midnite BlueThis set is excellent quality.It will ""grow"" with the child. It is sturdy and made to last. My grandson loves it."
4,3-Piece Junior Drum Set,We recently purchased this drum set for our Eight year old son for Christmas. He loves it so now all he needs is lessons. This is a great beginner set.
4,Wonderful set for little ones,"I have to say this is the cutest little drum set I've ever seen! It is very high quality and is the perfect size for my 6 &8 yr old children. I put a small pillow in the bass to get rid of the ring and now it sounds totally authentic. I love that it came with the high hat and stool, which some of the smaller sets didn't come with. I am searching for a second tom-tom and mount as well as a floor tom that might go with it, but otherwise it was a perfect buy. We are so happy with it."
5,drum set for grandson,This kids drum set FAR EXCEEDED my expectations! My 4 yrs. old grandson was THRILLED!! I am most thrilled that I had them delivered to his house instead of mine :) Many hours of fun and they look and sound real!!
4,"Decent book, other resources more useful","My mom surprised me with this book, but I have to say that http://www.environmentalcrossing.com has been the best resource in my job search. They've got jobs geared towards what I'm looking for and it was so much easier than trying to sort through all the junk on other job search sites. Since all of the jobs are from actual employer websitse you don't get any of the scam jobs that seem to be the majority of other sites content!"
4,Revenge is Deadly,"Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES may be a book that happened before its time. Well written and fast flowing Lily Forrester has worked her way up the ladder in the DA's office to Chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Then her world falls apart when her daughter turns against her and her husband begins to resent her sucess at her chosen career.Written 20 years ago, the revenge Lily takes when her daughter is raped was unacceptable as the idea of a woman making her way in the DA's office. Things have changed rapidly in the world of fiction.MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES is worthy of a second look, 20 years later.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,good,"I haven't read any good books lately (trying to decipher the monotony of Mary Higgins Clark, I suppose) and this book was lying around in my father's office, so I seized the moment and borrowed it. From the very beginning, this cross between John Grisham's ""A Time To Kill"" and Sandrs Brown's ""Charade"" captivates the audience and holds on for an entertaining, if somewhat predictable, ride. I recommend this to people who haven't had a good read and would like a fast-paced, realistic novel. Enjoy."
2,"Had to skip over many pages, boring","The first book that I ready by this author was Interest of Justice, which I loved, fast paced, not too descriptive, great writing style. So I thought that I would read all of her books. You would never know this book- Mitigating Cir. was by the same author. It starts off a little slow, gets going, then loses it's steam throughout most of the book. I got tired of reading page after page of what they were having for dinner, the item of clothing that the daughter borrowed, her boring conversations with her husband, blah blah blah. It didn't get good again until the last few pages where you will find out what happens to Lily. The plot was a good one, but the writing couldn't hold my interest. I hope her other books are better."
1,Didn't Bother to Finish,"I didn't bother to finish this book. The writing is amateurish, and the author's attempts at descriptive narrative are cliche and often repetative. The characters are one-dimensional and predicatable. Overall, this book reads like a bad romance novel disguised as a legal thriller."
3,Helicoil is the way to go,"A Helicol is the correct way to fix damaged threads, but if its for a non vital part then this will do. I used this on the transmission bell housing for a light damaged thread and it worked fine, but for threads that were severely damaged I went the helicoil route."
5,Excellent,I purchased this bathing suit and I was very impressed with the quality and fit. It fit perfect and the material is very comfortable. I am going to buy another one in a different color!
5,Bought on a whim,"I recently came across this while unpacking some boxes in my new house. I hadn't read it for at least a decade, and just finished it yesterday again. I'm not really a ""fan"" of Andre Norton, as in I just haven't ever read any of her other books, and have no idea why I bought it all those years ago while a freshman in college. It's a great little action novel. The just get on with it kind of book that is so rare to read these days, and so refreshing to find. I'd recommend it to all readers, but especially for teens. It's a great book for a young person, who can empathize with the light of our hero, Michael Karl. My only wish is that she had written another book or two starring the young Prince, and his cousin, The King."
5,One of my faverites,I got it when it first come out and have read it many times sense . It's an adventure story along the lines of Prisoner of Zenda . So many really good books are out of print . Which is a shame . I love this book . Haunting used books stores are a faverite past time of mine .I'm re reading it right now . I have re read this many times . Like a welcome old friend it is .
4,wine rack,I bought this wine rack for my sister in law. It's her first rack. It looks so nice in her kitchen hanging from the ceiling. I want one for myself! So attractive!!!
5,great produt,this produt i buy for a giff because i have one ready and my friends loved so i buy for a giff to him and loved too
4,nice rack! :),... get compliments on this unique wine rack all the time. the only thing is that i can't place a bottle on the very top loop. it's becomes horizontal with the weight of the bottles on the other tiers and slips off the back side ...
2,"Looks great, unable to properly install",The item looks great. It arrived as ordered. Why did I give it a poor review? Because the top hole in the bracket is aligned with the curved bar that has the hook for the tendrils. You will not be able to screw it in straight with a normal drill and screw bit. So far I have been unable to install it securely. This aspect is poorly designed and is not worth a great rating. If they redesign it and put the factory made hole above the top part of the curve I would give it a much better rating.
5,"Future Step-Moms, Please Read!!","I'm getting married in a few weeks to a man with a seven-year-old son. I have been devouring every book and piece of information I could get my hands on to help prepare me for our step-family. This book was amazing!It is thoughtful and thought-provoking--I couldn't put it down. My eyes have been opened to different points of view which has helped my relationship with my fiance and his son tremendously.I would recommend this book for anyone about to enter into the unchartered territory of blending a family. You will feel so much more confident and ""safe."""
2,Mainly for step-families,"This book was not useful to me, just starting the process of divorce. It focuses on the time period after one or both parties have entered into new relationships, and how all parties can get along. Perhaps it will be useful in the future, but not at this point. I wish the reviews and summaries had been more clear about the subject matter of the book."
3,Mostly works...not the silver bullet!,"I bought the gallon size container to treat three small cat urine carpet stains. After following the instructions and several applications over a few days I can still smell the urine. Like with water or any other liquid, Petastic caused the smell of urine to intensify following the first hours to day after application (though it does less as it completely dries). My biggest issue is that the urine was not completely neutralized after the use of two gallons of the product! I also found that the product moved the stain outward from the original spot (can tell by using nose-to-the-ground and blacklights).I worked with the sales rep from Petastic (Gil) and he was very nice (sent me the second gallon free of charge). However, the product still has not worked as expected. I still recommend you try this out as it did help remove most of the stain/smell but not 100%.My next step is to lift of the carpet and have the pad removed (maybe seal the concrete too).Bummer."
3,I had hoped for more,"After reading some of the other reviews I decided to try this product on some urine stains that I had discovered after they had been dried for several weeks. I totally saturated the stains and let the product set overnight and then blotted them up. I was disappointed to find that I could still smell a faint urine smell. And if I could then I KNOW my dog could. Perhaps it works well on fresh puddles that you can blot up and then treat, but it is no cure-all for old stains."
4,Very attractive...,"Our new pot rack is functional, beautiful and seems to be quite sturdy. My only complaint is that the hooks don't allow the pans to hang sideways...they hang with the pan itself facing front so they end up overlapping each other."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap",The painted on finish rubbed off on my hands and stained my cloths. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
5,Great buy,this rack is exactly what I wanted. It holds more then the picture shows. I use the bookrack for my lids. Comments from my friends have been that is great where did you buy it? Amazon.com I said. I would definetly reccomend this.JThompson
5,Best One Out There,"This book sets the standard for how rafting guide books should be written. It gives all the information you need before running a river: maps, river flow data including recommended ranges, directions to the put-ins and take-outs, and river logs identifying various rapids and hazards (as well as suggestions on how to negotiate them). If only the river trips could be as good as the book. While there is good rafting in Washington, don't be surprised to encounter rainy weather, ice-cold water, short float seasons, crummy put-ins/takeouts, and narrow, log-constricted rivers!"
4,From Brazos,"In 2001, Time magazine called Stanley Hauerwas ""America's finest theologian."" Now his peers (e.g., Robert Wilken, George Lindbeck, Robert Jenson, David Burrell, and Robert Bellah) honor and critique the key themes of his thought. Compassionate but controversial, Stanley Hauerwas is always stimulating."
3,Excellent overview of one of comics' most talented art pools,This beautiful hardcover book is an excellent introduction to some of the finest artwork produced in comics in the last 10 years. The book is also great for fans of the Vertigo imprint as it presents many familar covers sans logos and other information that masks the artwork. Each image is presented in glorious color and contains an informative description. A must have for all Vertigo fans and fans of well drawn comics.
5,Seiko diamond accent watch,Very attractive watch and easy to read. Shipped promptly without excessive charges. Good value.
2,Very Disappointed,The watch was purchased to give as a Christmas present. It was not running upon arrival. Contacted company by email immediately and to date have not heard back from them. I will not recommend Famous Watch nor will I ever purchase from them again!
5,"Karla Cruz is crminally overlooked!. She's got all the goods, a voice to die for and great material!","Karla Cruz is an enigmatic, talented, singer/songwriter and artist that defies cliches or cut and paste description. Classically trained on violin, Karla began playing music when she was old enough to pack an instrument. Karla went on to excel in music through-out high school and college, playing various instruments, but primarily violin, guitar, and keyboards At the same time, Karla became interested in singing, and inspired by a chance encounter, she auditioned as vocalist for a jazz group. She was accepted, and has been pursuing a music career ever since. She has gravitated to her own style of Indie Pop/Rock; a bluesy mixture of melancholic ballads, and soulful melodies. While Karla's music is unique, some of the names heard when discussing her music are Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, and Chrissy Hynde."
5,"After 12 years, I still love this flatware",I bought this service set to go with my Hafnia flatware. I entertain a lot and you can never have too many serving pieces. This flatware is top notch and a great buy. It is unusual and gets lots of compliments. Great stuff!
4,great for storage,I bought this trunk to store my families endless amount of shoes. It works very well and is strong and durable. I am pleased with this product.
3,Valentine: Fully Loaded,"I received two Valentine books. They were both bent back as though the seller had tried to force the two books into a flimsy, small package. I would not recommend the seller but would still recommend Amazon.com. However; I believe that Amazon.com must make sure that not only the books are in intact but that the seller also places them in a protective bag."
1,Stay away!!,"This is a terrible version of these recordings. Way too much hiss, this sounds like it was just a bad needle drop (copied from an old LP to a CD) with no mastering whatsover. Worst of all, some of the songs have the end clipped!! Stay away and look for the domestic release on Verve (cheaper by the way)."
5,Loss Prevention Bible,"F.P. Lees Loss Prevention provides the fundamentals for any viable prevention program throughout all segments of industry. It covers recognized good engineering practices that can transform a good company into a GREAT company through protection of profits from unintended incidents, downtime, and litigation costs. These volumes cover it all and are as critical to a corporation's bottom line as any financial manual."
1,Received Rusted!,"I researched this product in different websites and even contacted one of the sellers regarding the finish. But, what I suspected about the finish happened anyway. I received the product and the finish was chipping off and it was rusted all around. The finish had bubbled up and chipped off in different areas therefore making it not worth the money. Any product that has a spray on finish is going to end up chipping in the future so I was trying to make sure that this product had a quality workmanship. It is sort of like putting nail polish on too thick before it dries and it ends up bubbling up and chipping off. I would not recommend this product, aside the fact I ended up eating the shipping amount even though it was considered ""free shipping""."
4,VERY EASY TO SET UP/ Sturdy,"This nicely finished pot rack was super quick set up, plenty of chain for higher or lower mounting.My only issue was the balls on the hanging hooks sometimes were too large to fit through some of our cast iron pans. But there was a simple remedy, turn them backwards."
2,I do not recommend it,"I got ""Reiki 2nd Level Attunement Learn and Use the Reiki Sacred Symbols"". I found it far from what is an attunement, according to the Oriental tradition. There is no attunement without a Master physically present. I dont recommend it to anyone."
5,perfect!,Nothing can compare to this performance of the Rach 3. Forget the SHINE Cd...buy this instead.
2,Pasty,"I really thought that I would like this flour. But everything I make with it seems a little starchy. Has a kind of wallpaper paste texture, gummy. I won't be buying this again."
3,"Good, not great",I bought this book after scanning all the pages. It meets my needs for right now. I need improvement in my use of negative space and punching up the color. I will use the paint-on-critiques and then pass this book along.
3,It's just OK,It's more suitable for beginners. There is not much information. There are some good suggestions. The book title attracted me. It's pretty basic.
5,Great workshop especially for early painters!,I bought this one early in my career and learned a great deal.I have purchased 3 other as a gift for friends at that special moment when they want help. I just bought one for myself & its just for me. I will recommend & tell them where they can locate it. Mollie
4,Great Little Lamp,"Between my home and work I have ~ 6 or 7 of these. They perform well, they don't eat bulbs too quickly. They are fairly light weight; if you like your desk appliances to weigh a ton, that is the only thing I can imagine that there could be to dislike about this great little lamp. I you have an Ikea near you I would recommend saving $3 and getting the exact same lamp they call the ""Espressivo."""
2,Itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dot ... desk lamp,"The picture of this object is misleading, borderline fraudulent. I expected this item to be a ""normal"" sized desk lamp (maybe 2 feet in length), but instead I got an item that is 9 inches tall (can be extended to 13 inches). The comment about the TV antennas is completely accurate - I'm guessing the manufacturer had an excess of TV antennas.I would be more angry if I wasn't so humored by how ridiculously small this light is.Lesson learned: always look carefully at the ""dimensions"" of an item, even if you think that nobody would ever make a miniature item of that class of products."
2,Looks like a tv antenna with a light on it,"Take an old set of rabbit ear style antennas put a light on the top and you pretty much have this lamp! But hey it works good, the base is fairly heavy so there is no worries of knocking it over. I wish it was a little taller, and the arms a little stronger but for $10 its not a bad little lamp"
1,stop working in 2 months,"Though I am unhappy about how tiny it is, I am not going to complain it because I ordered it with knowledge about the dimension.The complain I have, which is much more serious than its size, is that it stops working in less than 2 months! How come?"
2,Small Tv Atenna lamp,This lamp a smaller than average lamp. It has a base and two atenna things that hold the light itself and it can go up and down. It gets hot fast! Honestly I don't trust it and I am getting rid of it.
1,I really regret that I bought this tiny useless lamp,"As other reviewer has written, I regret. When I got this, I was quite disappointed because it was too small than I expected based on the picture. Anyway, I put it on my desk and used it for two nights(I didn't even use the lamp during day time). After two days, it's just gone, I don't know whether its bulb's just exhausted or the lamp itself is broken in some way. I don't know where I can get the replacement bulb and don't want to bother myself to return it or send it to the manufacturer for warranty. It's just not worth for anything. I just wasted my money and time."
4,Great read!,"Moulton's novel was a great read that was super interesting! The stories of Tina and her adventures took the reader to some very exciting places that Moulton articulately described, providing the reader with great pictures and additional historical descriptions. The mystical theme offers a story that captures and retains the reader's attention throughout the entire novel. Not only is it a young adult novel, but it is suitable for all ages and anyone ready for a thought provoking plot that also establishes entertainment. Can't wait for the next one to come out! For anyone that appreciated Harry Potter or enjoyed The Chronicles of Narnia, this is a must read and should be at the top of your to do list."
1,SENt wrong reader,I originally orderd the MobileLite 9-in-1 memory card reader. I recieved a Mobilelite G2. This is not the same unit. I was very dissappoited as the G2 just does not fit my needs and it only has two card slots instead of three. It will not read the micr SD cards. It does not fit well in the case that I used for the 9-in-1 reader. When I checked on why I did not geet the 9-in-1 reader I was told they did not know that the wrong picture and info was on the site.
2,"Love the Idea and was Hopeful, but","This product worked great for me until I switched from Vista to Windows 7.If, by chance it was more a matter of the wear and tear, then I have this to say: Firstly, I am very careful with all of my techy toys. That said, I used this item no more than 15 times (I can count about 10) and stored it very carefully.Disappointing."
3,Kingston Mobilelite 9-in-1,I bought this card reeder because in the add say that it cud read sim cards.JR.
1,Did not work as expected,"I could not get this product to work on over 7 systems, so I assume I received a bad unit. However I didn't like the quality of the unit either so I decided not to get an exchange."
1,Utterly useless,"Won't even read a standard SD card, never mind SDHC. I'd give this zero stars if that was an option."
1,Poor design,"Doesn't read my card if it's all the way in - I have to gently inch it in until the green light flashes. Half the time it doesn't work, until recently when, after 3 months, it stopped working altogether.Go elsewhere."
1,Short life,My reader worked well for about 3 months. It was sketchy for the next couple of months. Now it doesn't work at all. I will not be replacing this one with another Kingston.
1,Absolute junk,This particular card reader freezes my Vistas computer constantly. It worked couple of times but lately it just crashes my computer.
1,can only read some of my cards,fails reading:PQI 4GB SDSANDISK 1GB SDSANDISK 256MB SDPatriot 16GB class6 SDHCreads:Patriot 8GB Micro SDHC class4canon 32Mb SDKingston 64Mb SD
3,Swiss army knfe card reader,"This is a good all in one card reader that is portable and self contained. The transfer speeds on it could be better, but it works. It travels well and reads a lot of different formats."
5,Excellent product,I love this product because it can read different types (sizes) of SD cards and extremely easy to use.Perfect item so you don't have to install any camera software !!!
5,"Basic, good, no problems.","There's not much to say about this. The string connecting the cap is a great idea, and I was pleasantly surprised that I could load up the slots separately and they would mount as separate volumes and could be used at the same time."
2,Kingston Mobilite 9in1 card reader,"I can get only 1 of the 2 I bought to work. Sometimes the one that works needs to be squeezed or wiggled to make the green LED lite up, then it works, sometimes not. It seems to have an intermittant connection with the cards (I tried SD, SDHC and Micro SD, all Kingston). My older Kingston Travelite SD reader has always worked fine, but it wont support SDHC cards, so I got this one. Big mistake. I think Kingston has some design or Quality Control issues needing correction on this product."
5,Great product,I bought this product mainly to transfer media faster to the MicroSD card in my phone. I've also used it with a miniSD and haven't had a problem with either. Works great.
2,Cheaply made,"The first time I used it the clear plastic SDHC card ejector broke off. So now every time I use it, I have to be careful not to lose the ejector. I can make the ejector work but with some manual force."
4,"does the job, very convenient micro SD slot","It's very convenient. Love being able to use the micro sd card without the need for an adapter, and also the fact that at the same time I can read a regular SD (3 different slots). The clip to secure the slots is a bit low quality and may break with use, but this will not affect the use of the reader. Does the job well. The first one I received had a defect, but the sender sent me a replacement right away which worked well til now."
3,It works but not anything amazing,I bought this item because it was cheap. Don't exactly need much with a card reader so I wasn't too worried about it. The catches that hold each of the covers down are not very well done. When I got it both covers were very tight. I ended up breaking one of them just to get it open. By breaking I mean breaking the catch. The cover still closes and the cardreader works fine but the cover doesn't catch. The other one (which I don't actually use because I only use it for the SD card reader right now) is still functional and tight.Edit: It's been a couple months now. The plastic crumbled apart that holds the whole thing together. Needless to say it no longer works. Next time I'll spend a little more and get something that won't fall apart.
2,It doesn't work consistently.,"Maybe I just got a lemon, but it's not dependable. I had to connect the card reader to three different computers before the last computer finally recognized it. Then it took three tries for the device to read the memory card I put in it."
4,Spend The Extra Money!,"I've had my Miele vac for several years now and am almost completely satisfied with it. Great power -- it really DOES clean very effectively, is much quieter than most vacuums, has great accessories, a very powerful powerhead for carpet cleaning, and it's easy to use. To top it all off, the Miele is downright pretty!The filters are great, it's much cleaner internally than most vacs, and the vacuum cleaner bags can be removed without spewing dust all around. Absolutely the only drawbacks I find with this cleaner are its lack of a power switch on the metal wand and awkward upright storage. If you buy the next level up, I think even those flaws are absent, but I didn't have the money to buy the more expensive model at the time. Other than that, I would buy it again tomorrow. It's a terrific cleaner and a whole lot better than any other cleaner I've ever owned (that would be about ten different cleaners over the years). Well worth the money."
4,Picking Fruit with Ease,"I purchased this for my sister who has several tall citrus trees that bear large fruits that yearly wasted away b/c she was unable to retrieve them. After receiving this item, she now shares her bountiful produce by the bagfuls! The Fruit Picker allows easy harvest of fruits several feet higher with just a twist, and the basket can hold a couple of items at a time. The only challenge she has come across is as she is picking fruits, on occasion there will be that one stubborn lemon or orange that refuses to come off, and she has had to result to a yanking tug-of-war. On that rare circumstance the fruit picker was not able to achieve its goal. Overall, this item has permitted us to enjoy a generous portion of my sister's crops!"
2,It is not what it seems,I am dissapointed that it is advertised as 'telescopic'. It is just one piece of wood stick that you attach the basket. To return it was too bothersome.
1,Packaging,"I had purchased this item for a gift. When it arrived it was in a plastic sack and wound with packaging tape....no box. So, I tied a ribbon around it and gave the gift in the material it was sent in. Not very attractive, but I didn't have a choice. When my husband opened it on his birthday, it was badly scratched and the pole was bent, enough so that the telescoping feature would not work. An item this light-weight (approx. 2 lbs.) should be shipped in a box that has been padded with styrofoam peanuts. Apparently, some warehouse person or the delivery driver dropped a heavy container on the pole end of my spindly fruit picker. I have returned it to Amazon and hope they will package the replacement in a better fashion. A piece of plastic just won't do it."
4,Very well made harvester,"This is a well made harvester. My only reason for not giving a 5 rating is because I haven't had the chance to use it yet. Based on it's construction, there is no question in my mind that it will do a fine job for years to come."
2,Atomic Projection Alarm,"Several items have not met my expectations, the first being that the background stays black and I can only see the time at night on the ceiling. Another is that I don't know how to set the zone as the instructions were not specific. Then when my husband tried to install the outside temperature transmitter, the part that nails into the wall broke. Please advise me as to how to resolve these problems. I really would like to send it back and try another clock. This is the first time I have been disappointed in an order from you. Looking forward to hearing from you."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent and yummy. Everyone that had one of these LOVED it. Quick shipping, product arrived in fine condition. Makes a terrific gift."
5,Great Gift,"Arrived timely, nicely packaged - nice presentation. A delicious treat - not something you see every day. Recipient loved these!"
4,One stop sourcebook for Hermetic and Cabalistic Magic(k),"This book is a revelation of many of the important papers of the Golden Dawn of MacGregor Mathers, A. Crowley, W.B. Yeats and others. It presents systematically the early stages of study in the Golden Dawn Tradition. There is nothing that a Golden Dawn temple will provide in writing about the first 3 or 4 grades of advancement toward adepthood. I took away a couple of points because of the author's terse and slightly archaic method of writing and for the fact that he wrote an entire chapter on enochian magick and enochian chess after admitting in the first sentence that he knew nothing about them. In any case, it's a great beginner to intermediate level source book for correspondences, Golden Dawn tradition and explanation of hermetic symbology. For the serious student, not for someone looking for light reading."
3,Helping in Qualifier Exam....,"This is a good book, which contains difficult and important problems in each part of physics. Problems are quite hard. One should attempt these problems after having a clear understanding of the subject matter. Don't look at the solutions first. Spend sometimes first solving the problem. Each problem is a collection of several short problems which are really important.I strongly recommend this to anyone who is Preparing for Qualifier exam."
4,Discos Fuentes: Andale!,"This is an enjoyable disk, especially for those who want some lively music to bolster their ""bailable"" collection. On the other hand, if one already has a large collection of that kind of music (as I do), one will find many repeats here. The Colombianos are terrifically musical, though, and for the money this disk and its companion (with the same title) are worth having. The best one, though, is the Discos Fuentes collection titled ""Colombia!"" That one is essental."
3,Is that bad?,"Can't really remember the movie, must have passed out from BOREDOM. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing."
3,bad cd,"useful phrases in book, but the cd is a bit messed up. it will randomly switch from first stating the english followed by italian to then stating the italian followed by english. very hard to follow because of this. they really need to redo this."
5,Molto Buono,Italian for Travelers was perfect for my trip to Italy during the Olympics. The book is well organized and is instantly useful! It has inspired me to learn more about the Italian language.
2,Audio Version Difficult for 1st Timers who have no book as reference,"This audiobook might be fine as a refresher, or if you already have the book to follow along, but as a stand alone for someone who does not know the language, I found it frustrating. I need to be able to see the words. Some of the sentences after the first couple of chapters were too long for me to repeat with any success."
3,Not bad when you're in a jam,"Prior to my trip to Italy I brushed up on some Italian. I learned how to buy a train ticket, locate a bathroom, and even compliment a waiter for his service. But the book does not do a very good job preparing you for conversation. Whenever anyone responded to my requests or comments, I could not understand the words they used because it wasn't covered in the audio CD's.For a better crash course in any language, I would suggest Pimsleur audio. I had to learn Russian a few years back so I used that series from a local library. I must say it worked so well, I was having full conversations with Russian-speakers in Ukraine. Check those out first before reaching for a book like this."
1,Not as helpful as i thought it would be,"There are many instances where the Italian phrase is too long and Fodor doesn't break it up to allow a beginner to learn how to say it. I have another language learning CD where single words are broken into syllables, and then phrases are built, which is a much better way to learn a brand new language."
5,One of the best,I am sure there are other chairs that are great out there. We have had ouor Svan chair for 2 years. It grows with the kid. We are purchasing a second one for kid #2.The chair fits infants really well and is adjustable. We did not use the lap belt. We did buy the cover for the chair which helps our kids sit in it better.I would highly recommend this chair to anybody.
2,"Good, not great","We had a lot of trouble with the plastic clips that hold the tray down to the chair. After first trying larger screws (the original screws just pulled out of the wood), we finally had to drill through the tray from above and attach strong bolts.The bolt heads actually look good, but this should not happen with a chair this expensive.Day to day use, the chair has been fine, but just not worth the cost. Yes, it looks nice, but it will be out of your life in a year or two, and I think one with a bigger tray would have served us better."
2,Plastic Clasps are a weak link,"While this chais is obviously very stylish and sleak, i found the plastic clasps that brace the tray to the actual chair to be a significant problem. the table rarely feels very secure, due to the fact that the clasps are typically loose. i have to re-tighten them very often, to the point that the screws no longer have much wood to grab onto, and i will have to begin using larger, non-svan issued screws. the clasps are bent at an angle that makes tightening both screws very difficult with anything other than a very short screw driver with a large philips head on it. it seems like an easily fixed flaw, but when i read about people complaining about the loosness of the tray, this is the core problem that they are referring to."
1,Awful,I have had this highchair for 2 months and the paint is chipping and the wood is splintering. The whole chair is pretty wobbly and I don't see how this will grow with my child.The tray is also a pain to take on and off
2,"Looks beautiful, functions terrible","We bought this thinking wood was 'healthier' or 'safer' for baby. It comes with a plastic tray cover which we figured we didn't have to use, but unfortunately the paint is chipping and peeling and gets all over babies hands. So we started using the plastic cover, but the thing is so hard to get on and off it has almost ripped our nails off. Baby has been using this about 2 months now (she's 8 months) and already it is loose and the screws are coming out. The fabric is very nice but not very practical, there is no way to clean it without putting it in the wash. I can get over that in order to avoid plastic, but the other issues with the chair have made this a bad purchase for our family and we will be looking for something else."
5,"Fabulous, super functional, chic high chair","I own the espresso Svan high chair and LOVE it!! Not only does it look great in my kitchen, but it has served my daughter soooo well. The seat back adjusts to accommodate your growing child. The chair is very sturdy. It also adjusts to become a toddler and small child seat. It is a chair you will love for years - not just when your child is a baby. Other high chairs get used for a year or two, but you will likely use this for 3-4 years. Thank you Svan for designing a very functional and beautiful high chair."
1,Not so happy...,"This was a beautiful chair and worked great until my son started feeding himself...~The food fell on his lap, the floor, and in the very hard to clean crevices of the chair.~The wood soak up the water when I wiped it down. This really concerned me because the wood started to blister up. My husband and I had to take it apart and polyurethane it to protect the wood.~Once my son got a little bigger (12 months), he would rock in the chair and I was always concerned he would tip it over. This never happened, but he did loosen the screws enough that the whole chair wobbled seriously.We ended up turning it into a toddler chair once he was old enough to eat at the table. For our second we bought a Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat and can't say enough good about it. It's plastic, but you can still scoot the chair under the table and you can't see it!!!"
5,Love our chair!,This is the best high chair ever made. It is a beautiful piece of furniture. It wipes clean. Adjusts easily for growing child. Fits right up to kitchen table so my son can sit at the table with the rest of the family. We LOVE it.
1,Manufacturing country,"I love Svan high chair design, but what a waist manufacturing it in China.Svan's cushion is PBDE free, but they use other fire retardants to comply with California law. They replaced penta-BDE with a cocktail of other chemicals, whose identity, Scandinavian Child didn't know and had to send me to manufacture, who is in China to find out.As for the rest of eco friendly materials(wax, glue, polish)used to build this chair I can't say a good word. Manufactures always trying to cut corners and China is the best in them. they don't have the luxury to think about ""green and friendly"" :("
2,A bit misleading,"Although it works well and as described, the body of the carafe is glass, not stainless steel, as pictured. This would make a big difference to most people."
2,Terrible Replacement Item!,"This coffee pot/carafe leaks when I am trying to pour some coffee into a cup! I end up having to remove the lid -- awful - unfortunately, I threw away the box and receipt info - thinking - what could go wrong with a coffee pot/carafe?"
4,Early June,"June Christy made this intimate recordings in the 'mid-40s, a good five years or so before she really began coming into her own as a persuasive and different kind of jazz singer. Her voice and style are only in the formation stage. Still, the album is pleasant and offers a lot of great standards."
2,not what I wanted,"Most of the information in this book is already available on the author's website (google fedup) I was looking for something that goes more into depth regarding the diet itself and how to do the challenges to establish what the intolerances are. This I found, just google 'failsafe wordpress' for the wordpress blog.So to be honest, no need to read or buy this book. I guess the value of this book lies in giving it to someone whom you wish to convince that normal food can definitely cause a lot of behavioral problems. However, after you've read the website, buy the book as sign of appreciation!"
5,Life changing for kids and parents!,"As a Naturopath and Nutritionist I work with a lot of kids with behavioral issues, digestive problems and skin complaints. While there are some great supplements to help with symptoms they do not always get to the cause of the problem. Chemicals in natural foods and processed foods can cause all sorts of problems for susceptible individuals and the Fed Up book is an easy to follow guide to help you through a step by step process to work out what is triggering your child's symptomsHighly Recommended"
5,choosing the right dog,"I consider this to be the best book of its type. Although it was written in 1980, and obviously much of the information is out of date, it is a concise and thoroughly researched guide. The strength of this book is that the author omits biased information and, thankfully, doesn't try to steer the reader with an emotional spin."
3,A good start,"The book itself provides an indepth look at BDD, my wife was recently diagnosed with the disorder. However, the book simply tells you about the symptoms and what the patient is going through. It provide little insight on obtaining help. My wife met with the author Katherine Phillips but was only offered a place in her new study for her new book. I feel that writing about the disorder is just that. Nobody seems to be offering a solution. For the price, it's a good book to share with freinds and family to help them understand the pain and stress the disorder puts on everday life. Thanks."
1,Discription not clear,"I was under the understanding that the order was for 2 packs of 6 pair each, not 2 pair. They are nice socks but I wouldn't have payed over $13.00 a pair for them"
4,Can't go wrong with BRIO or Bob the Builder,"The directions weren't included with the kit I received but thankfully all the pieces arrived and it was easy and fun to assemble. Despite being simple to put together, it hasn't yet come apart. It rolls easily, too, which my twins always appreciate. It's always fun when a 'truck' races easily across the floor after a good push!"
2,Lazy pop!,"What a lazy decision to release this as a single! ""Crazy People Rock"" was the final nail in the coffin of Cain's music career with Warner. Not only did it lack in being promoted, but unfortunately there was very little to actually market here.Its cheesy pop at it's cheesiest! The remixes of it are bearable and the non album track ""On the dance floor"" is quite catchy and enjoyable. It's a little less cheesy and has a ""Jamaraquoi"" sound to it.Not too much else to say on this one. It's disappointing that Cain wasn't able to release his preferred style of music. I think you can hear it in the lack of emotion in Cain's voice on the track, a sign that he doesn't really enjoy singing such rubbish! If you are going to buy ""Crazy People Rock"" stick to the Supafly remix (track five), otherwise keep it on repeat on track three!"
1,very poorly made,"This product was extremely poor quality, all the mounting plates where not square with the wall.When you tried to tighten the sheetrock hangers that I had to buy separately they pulled out of the sheet rock.the whole thing was so poorly made I would of sent it back but now I had 6 holes in my wall. Very unpleasedthen the pot hangers that where pictured on the middle beam of the rack would not fit there because they where not bent properly. so we had to hang them on the front edge. If you are shopping for a pot rack don't buy this one I wished I hadn't."
2,sloppy welding job,"Just received this pot rack and it was horrible. The left side bracket was not welded properly so it sat to the left, we could not get it straight and by trying to fix it, the bottom part of bracket would separate from the bottom, this prevented it from being flushed against the wall on the left. so there is a space of about 1/2 on that side. Upon further review, i noticed everthing was welded crooked and it was very noticeable. It looks horrible. Unfortunately, my husband put it up and did not care, I will sending this back. Do not buy. The color was nice."
4,great item but hard to install.,This is wonderful. It has saved me so much cabient space. However installing it was a pain due to one scew hole was not cut right and all of them were difficult to get to because there was so little clearance between the screw holes and the front part of the rack. I sugest you use a drill extention to put this up. If you don't have one allready order one with it.
5,Wall Mounted Pot Rack,"Excellent quality, very sturdy and pretty pot rack with a shelf above to hold or display things also. Love this product which holds many, many pots and pans because of it's length. Completely satisfied!"
2,Flimsy but great sound effects,"I saw this clock at a gift shop in St. Louis and had fun checking out the realistic drag racing sounds and the Christmas tree, but it is extremely flimsy and cheap. My assumption is that it would be broken in short order. I didn't make any attempt to set the alarm, but was happy to push the button to create the drag racing sound effects! Not sure the other patrons of the shop were as happy with the sound as I was."
3,It's like fighting both sides of a mirror...,"I remember seeing ads for this album in Marvel Comics back when I was a kid. Never got it back then, but now I have it on CD. It tells the story of Spider-Man through music plus narration by Stan Lee. The music is in a myriad of musical styles including pop rock, doo wop, swing and even the Alice Cooper-like ""Dr. Octopus Part 2"". Not a great album, but it is fun. At least it's probably better than the Broadway show!"
3,Good for kids and Spiderman addicts,I bought this CD for my son when he was about four years old because he loves Spiderman so much. He's nine now and still iistens to it! As an adult though I find that the music is very silly. It's just a bunch of really bad 70's songs about the superhero. I would only suggest it for a good clean album for kids to listen to or for the collector of Spiderman material.
4,Give it a shot.,"This is a must have for the Spider-man fan. I believe it is the same artists/songs release back in 1976, so expect a mix of bubble gum pop and funky stuff you'd expect from the 70's. Listen to the samples, if you like it, buy it. If you don't, buy it anyway. It's Spider-man."
1,Not at all suitable!,"This product is absolutely not suitable for hermit crabs. Aside from the wire, which could potentially be harmful to the crabs, the size is far too small to house one crab, let alone more and hermies are social creatures who need friends.You can get a 10 or 20 gallon tank fairly inexpensively from any pet store. Better yet, check Freecycle or Craigslist for free tanks. I've had very good luck and actually have a surplus of tanks at the moment, never having actually paid for any of mine."
2,Doesn't hold file folders,"I bought this hoping to have an attractive box to hang files for letter sized paper. It does not work. The box is just a little too wide to hold hanging folders - a couple reviewers also mentioned this (I should have listened). The folders can't hook onto the edge. I tried to buy a folder frame but there are none that adjust to the size of this box. So, I feel my purchase has been wasted and I don't want to go through the trouble of returning them - I'll sell them at my next garage sale.These boxes work fine to hold misc. items, like small toys. If you don't mind your papers lying flat, then you can use it as a file box."
3,Too Commerical,I liked them better before this album. Now they sound REALLY commerical. A lot of the songs are slower songs. I really LOVE the Lovehammers.. but there is no more edge to them with this CD.
2,Shaky Start,"I have the new Lovehammers Cd and also saw them perform twice in concert. As a fan of Marty's from the RS Show, I'm not really sure what to say about his latest release.........The live performances had nothing special about them. All the songs sounded exactly the same to me with the exception of the last 2 songs performed (Trees & Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire, Cash's Ring Of Fire was not nearly as good as other renditions by other bands, but it at least had a different sound from all the other material the band performed. The new CD has the same problems the live performances have. The only song from the CD I enjoy is ""Riddle"". Other than the song Riddle there is nothing special or unique on this CD."
1,I do not recommend,Did not like the album or their perfomance at the concerts. Too loud and screamy. Marty is a cool guy though
5,Not to be missed!,"For anyone in their 30's this is not to be missed. Great rock tracks that incorporate sounds of our youth! For everyone else, don't miss this CD if you want to listen to great music and have a great time!"
2,"Buy ""Murder on My Mind""","I LOVE Marty Casey, and the Lovehammers are absolutely FABULOUS live. Incredibly energetic and entertaining. I only give this CD 2 stars because this studio recording takes away some of the band's original feel - what is supposed to be an ""improvement"" actually increases the songs' cheesy-ness with odd sound mixing and strips the band of its intensity. I would recommend purchasing ""Murder on My Mind"" as your introduction to Marty Casey & Lovehammers - it has many of the same songs, and it rings more true to their emotional, raw live sound."
2,Disappointed,"I loved Marty on Rockstar:INXS and after the show I went out and bought Murder on My Mind which was amazing (best album you've never heard...buy that instead of this!). However, this is a shell of what Lovehammers have done in the past. I know they are better than this. They somehow lost their spark and charisma. It's probably because of the producer on this album and not Lovehammers themselves. It's just not Lovehammers as I know and love them. I hope in the future they stop listening to the producers or whoever told them that this was good and rock like they used to. The sound is just too contrived and over produced. However, it's a ok album and I still love the Lovehammers. They are great guys and deserve the best and I know they can rock way harder than this album makes it seem. It came out sounding just like every other rock band and they are unique. I hope the next one is better."
2,I Tried....,"I really wanted to like this CD because ,like many, I became a fan of Marty during Rockstar: INXS. I just can't get into the CD though. The songs aren't anything new or interesting IMO. I do like ""Clinic"" and ""Straight As An Arrow"", but the rest leave me cold. I do think Marty is very talented and if/when the band puts out another CD I hope I'll enjoy it more."
5,This CD Rocks!!,"This CD is all Rock... Marty Casey & Lovehammers brings back the rock sound that hasn't been heard from in quite awhile...this CD covers the awesome rock ballards of Clouds and Casualty, the catchy sounding tune of Trees, and the rousing rock deliveries of The Tunnel, Call Of Distress, and Straight As An Arrow. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone, who loves Rock! Yes I do!!!"
4,Should have won Rock Star!!!,"Some good tracks. Still screaming a bit too much. Marty needs to tone it down and use his God gifted voice to inspire chills. ""Wish You Were Here"" did that on the INXS show. He should have won!!!!!!!!!"
5,Well-rounded rock album!,"Having never heard of Marty Casey and The Lovehammers before Rockstar: INXS, I wasn't sure what to expect of this CD until I found myself ripping open the wrapping when I purchased this CD the other day. I fell in love with the song ""Trees"" when Marty performed it on the show, but really love the arrangement of it on the CD.I am a huge Pop music and Rock fan and find myself wondering why Marty and the band were not picked up by a big label sooner. These guys are solid rock and deserve more good things to come!If you're a fan of solid rock and roll, you gotta get these guys. And hey... if INXS has them opening for them all tour long, then you know these guys are a class act!"
5,Every Song Rocks!,"No need to skip those blah songs. There isn't a single one on this cd.Although some of the songs are from previous albums and have been re-recorded they still have that rock edge which is sorely lacking in today's music.Put it in, turn it up and rock your a** off! You won't be sorry.Way to go Lovehammers!"
5,Love the Lovehammers,"This is the Must Have CD for 2006. Marty Casey and the Lovehammers put their heart and soul in their music-you can hear it, and feel it. Marty's voice is mesmerizing. Billy, Bobby & Dino tear it up on each and every note. These songs grab you and don't let go. Even my 3 year old wants to listen to them over and over. If you haven't heard a Lovehammers song before, you need to buy this. If you have, you need to buy this."
4,This album is addicting.,"The first couple of time I listened to this album, I thought it was good but I wasn't blown away. Now, I can't stop listening to it. If you love '90s alternative/rock, this is a great album for you. There are two reasons I don't give it a full 5 stars: (1) Marty's voice is missing a bit of the rawness that I liked so much on Rockstar -- probably taken out in the recording studio; and (2) some of the lyrics are a little simplistic/obvious for my taste (i.e., Trees). Otherwise, great!"
5,This CD Rocks,"I first saw Marty on Rockstar. After that I found all of their songs that I could, including their last CD Murder On My Mind. This cd made up almost entirely of old songs is great. The Kourelis brothers, Bobby & Dino, and Billy Sawilchik are great on drums, bass, and guitar. There's not a bad track on this cd. The new track Casualty and Call of Distress, a song from Murder On My Mind, are my 2 favorites. I preordered this cd and I am glad I did. I couldn't be happier with it. This cd leaves no question that that Marty should be with Lovehammers, not INXS.This cd is a must have."
5,real & unique,"This CD rocks! And, these guys sound even better live!!It's great to see such wonderful talent out there - real & unique; Quite refreshing.If you like country, this isn't the CD for you. Yet, feel it has something for everyone.Although; Marty & Lovehammers do a great ""Ring of Fire"" (in concert)Keep spreading the love..."
2,Disappointed,While on vacation I caught one of Christina's Cable TV programs and was impressed with the recipes and preparation. Because I cannot view her TV program at home I purchased her book. I did not like the recipes in the book and returned it. I'm mostly interested in low fat vegetarian recipes. An alternative book Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites had many more recipes that I liked.
4,Love it,Just what I needed to get me out of my salad rutt. This will deffinately help me keep working to get rid of my fat *ss.
4,recipes that are healthy and taste good too!,"I've tried about a dozen of Christina's recipes and they've all turned out well. I always ask my husband (picky) to rate a new dish from 1-5 stars and so far he's given 4 or 5 stars to every dish we've tried. The only drawback to the recipes is that many call for a substantial number of ingredients or things I don't regularly have on hand, so I have to plan ahead if I'm preparing one of Christina's dishes."
4,Greek Myths anew,"I liked Stanek's ""The Kingdoms and the Elves"" much more than Riordan's ""Percy Jackson"". Still, there's something to be said about the new life Riordan gives to Greek mythology ala a Young Hercules-like hero. A fairly good read over all."
3,"Fun, Light Read. Nice in its own way.","So I kept comparing this book to the Harry Potter series, as I'm sure many of us would do.. but I think that isn't fair.This book is fresh and fun in its own way, and I do plan to finish the other 4 books in the series as well at some point.If you're looking for a relaxed, chilled fantasy read which is not very intense, its a great pick.Kids would love it."
5,Awesome and cool stuff!,I liked this book because it was the best possible book ever!It was very funny and cool. I liked this book because it was very good.
4,Every good story was borrowed from a previous one,"This is a book or a novel that is suppose to entertain....Every book, every story has borrowed ideas from somewhere... West Side Story? Twilight? sounds like Romeo and Juliet.... Look at all the Dracula stories or Werewolves stories... There are so many adaptations of Cinderella from all over the world... In every book you can sense oh I read that somewhere before... It's a great tool for writers to allow their readers to feel comfortable with the story... It gives the readers the background knowledge to appreciate the story more... It's a reference point... It adds to their reading skills as well because it is fluid... they don't have to stop and wonder what's going on... I am rambling...My point is to read the book for the sole purpose of entertainment... It may resemble another book but there are new antagonist and protagonist that are interesting... Don't take everything to seriously..."
4,Fun Start to the series - love the mythology,This was my first Percy Jackson book. It had a similar formula to Harry Potter (and many other heroic children coming of age books) but with a fun mythology underpinning. Perfect for a smart eight year old who loves to read along with a 46 year old who still likes to think of himself as in his early teens.
5,Wish I'd found them sooner,"Great book. Actually lives up to the hype. Fun reading in it's simplest form. No uber-pretty people, no ridiculous preaching on one of the authors pet issues. Just good human growth the natural and normal way; through living.What kind of hero is Percy Jackson: He's the Odysseus, Fox, Miles Vorkosigan type trickster. He's not going to win my beating someone into submission with a handy school bus, but he in no way lacks courage or strong convictions and the will to act on them.Great book."
4,American Gods is a much better choice,This book is okay - but if you want a much better book with similar themes then you should read American Gods by Neil Gaiman.
5,Best book ever!,I loved it great plot cant wait to read the next one !!! u shud read this book its really good
5,Fun fiction with Mythlogical Tie In,"Expected to enjoy the book and was not disappointed. Not only were all of te Greek Gods there, but each had rich personalities and were full of the angst I had only read about in junior high. I felt I got to know them personally. Who they are and what they rule is firmly entrenched in my mind.The author wittingly or unwittingly cracked open a market by appealing to troubled children. The origins of dyslexic and ADHD children are brought to light. They are the half human half God children sired by one of the many Greek Gods ad a human. It's no wonder kids are gobbling this series up.The story is narrated by Percy Jackson. The metaphors draw images and feelings explicitly for the reader. I am a Harry Potter fan. I enjoyed this book more and am looking forward to the rest of the series. Not only does it entertain, it teaches the reader Greek mythology, too.I highly recommend the book.'''''"
