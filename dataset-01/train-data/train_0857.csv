3,Good but get rid of the nudity,I thought this movie was great but I only gave it three stars because it was too long (many scenes weren't necessary) and there was too much sex (it would have been a good movie for kids to watch if not for the sex scenes). I wish Spike Lee would stop making all of his movies into softcore porns. It's totally needless. He did the same thing with Summer of Sam and I don't see what the point of it was.
2,Dissapointing return from Public Enemy,Not as good as expected. Wish that I would of spent money on a different album that I would have listened to more.
4,a good film,"this is a good film.not on Cooley High Level for me but a good film nevertheless.Denzel Washington continues to show why he is the man in Hollywood today.He is the best actor going around today.Ray Allen does a good job as well.this film takes what happen in above the rim one big step further with the lust of Money,sex,power.these elements are very important.the whole Agent&Image business. this film does a good job at dealing with the Pros&Cons of the modern day Player.good&bad.Jim Brown gives a solid performance as well."
3,Lee Got Game,"""He Got Game"" is another solid outing for director Spike Lee. He paints a realistic picture of life for a inner city basketball phenom and its many demands and pressures. Ray Allen isn't as proficient an actor as he is a shooting guard, yet his performance works here. Denzel Washington and a supporting cast of Lee film veterans deliver in their roles, making up for any inexperience Allen has. Washington is impressive as Allen's father, a convicted felon who is given a short work release to try to convince his star son to attend the governeor's alma mater. Revisiting this film about 9 years after its release, I still feel entertained and connected with the main characters. I feel it stands as a triumph for Lee and a good tale of basketball, exploitation, wounded family relations, and redemption (in a way)."
3,This is weak for a PE album,This album is better than the average rap album but it falls so far short of the work they did in the late 80's and early 90's. I am disappointed. I played the first three PE albums until the tape broke. This will collect some dust as it only lasted a few weeks in my car's rotation.
5,Denzel and Allen Great...,"Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) is the top high school prospect in the country. His father, Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) is in jail for accidently killing his wife. THe govenor has promised Jake that if he can convince his son to play for his alma mater that he will cut his prison time signifigantly. Jesus has never forgiven his father and has hatred toward him. There is tons of symbolism in this movie. Ray Allen had a great debut, especially for a basketball player! He really did a great job, and Denzel also gave a great performance as usual. Go see this movie it is very moving and is my personal favorite of all time."
4,He Got Game - DVD,Just included the movie disc itself without any additional features. It unfortunately is not compatible with my computer but works fine on the DVD.
3,It's ok,"The movie is good, but it could be better. I think Spike Lee, who is a great director and writter, lost himself a little bit in this film. For example I didn't understand the romance between Denzel Washington's and Milla Jovovich's characters. Was all that to show he still loves his wife? Absolutely unnecessary, in my opinion.Another problem is that Ray Allen was awful, even for an amateur actor.The meantime, there are beautiful scenes of basketball. The kind of one that makes you want to go outside and throw some shoots."
2,Best Soundtrack Ever,"Other than Denzel Washington's performance, the movie is horrible, 1 star quality. However, I bump it up to 2 stars for the movie score...it's amazing. This movie introduced me to Aaron Copland and I was blown away. Spike Lee does a fantastic job incorporating Copland's music into the film, without it I would of walked out of the theatre. The film is worth watching just to hear Coplands music in the backdrop.He Got GameGo buy this soundtrack."
5,He Got Game,Two Thumbs ups. A very motivating movie. This movie helped me in the really world that you never give up of your dreams and work hard to get it no matter what it takes.
2,MISGUIDED,"...He Got Game was not quite as good as I thought it should be. Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right. He is no actor, though, and his path to decisionmaking is pretty long and boring and there is just a bit too much sex in it. His conniving girlfriend Lala is trying to make him turn pro and is seeing agents on the side. She also has no qualms about not being loyal to him. Misdirected misfire, this film. It is a shame, but it did serve my immediate purposes."
5,YES!!!,"This CD scores! This CD has hit after hit and keeping the Public Enemy style. It's got everything: the beats, the lyrics, the swears. He Got Game is one CD that is hard to stop listening to. If you like Public Enemy than I suggest you buy this CD!!"
1,An insult to all women,"This movie was terrible. There are no strong women characters (I am a white male). Every female character is either playing the lead character for their own use (money) or they are selling their bodies to him. It is an insult to all women and to African-American women especially. If a Caucasian man had made this movie, he would be called racist and sexist, why is okay for an African-American to make it?"
1,He got game,"We just finally watched the video last night. It was defective and we could not watch parts of it. We tried cleaning it, but nothing worked. Very disappointed as we were more than half way through the movie."
1,He Never Had Game,"I was looking for a father-son movie for myself and my 16 year old. What a mistake! ""He Got Game"" has gratuitous sex that made us both blush and had nothing to do with the plot. Some cursing would be expected in a movie about coming up out of the projects. For someone named Jesus the main character is not at all Christ-like. And one other thing-Spike-next time you make a movie about the projects, they dont play ball on painted courts or have glass backboards! Unreal!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED DVD,I ordered HE Got Game - they sent the wrong DVD - I emailed them and never got a response!!!! I think they may send whatever dvd they want to get rid of. Still waiting for my DVD!!!!!!!!!!!
1,horrible movie,"This was one of Lee's worst. There were a load of unnecessary scenes that made the movie way too long. Also, as usual, this movie has a ton of jibes at white people and how they victimize black folks. However, Ray Allen was the worst part. This guy has horrible diction, trying really hard I could understand maybe half of what the guy said. I can't believe Ebert praised his performance."
2,Ray Allen who has the lead:great b-ball-player but bad actor,"This movie probably could've been at least a little good if SPIKE LEE hadn't casted the NBA-player RAY ALLEN, he joins Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal & Rick Fox (who also is in the movie) in the list of BASKETBALL-PLAYERS who makes movies but can't act.Denzel does good work in the film YES but it takes more to make a good movie than one or two people in it who knows how to act (Hill Harper is the second one).Not a very moving story mainly becouse RAY ALLEN's and MILLA JOVOVIC's horrible acting.If you thought that rappers were bad actors, they are nothing against b-ball players.Any SPIKE LEE-movie is better than this one so skip it."
5,"The dvd,Truth a good movie to watch","Irate this dvd high because it was enjoyable to watch.It is thetype of movie that will hold your attention, from the begining."
2,A not so good live DVD,"This DVD is not LIVE by any means. I hate these DVD's that are advertised as being LIVE, and you buy them, and it ends up being not live. That is the case with this DVD. This DVD has mixed interviews, in the MIDDLE of the songs, througout the DVD. I was disappointed and dont really recommend it. Sorry Rusted Root...."
4,This is an oldie but a goodie with no extra filler.,"This is the first book that really explained the fundamentals of how a race cars suspension works. It is in a handbook form that has consise explanations, with formulas and a math section in the back. If you want a book that covers all the basics quickly and has the formulas to go with it this book gets you there. Written from a circle track perspective."
5,Superb Work,"This is a must-have and a must-read by all who use the English language professionally, including attorneys, journalists, teachers, etc."
5,Makita drill,"I am pleased with the product. The only area of uncertainty was whether or not two batteries were included. They were, but I was not able to ascertain this for sure from the descriptive material. The unit is lightweight, powerful and well balanced. The keyless chuck works very well."
5,DHL,"Very nice product, preformed great on a huge deck project. The charger worked as advertized, charged fast and strong. I love this little,tough,and powerfull drill!The light is a nice addition, too"
5,None Better!!!!,"This is the second one I've owned. I install cabinets and countertops and have tried most all other types, This Makita was recommended to me by an electrician several years ago because of it's power to bore holes. I found it light( three pounds) and small and easily fit into cramped cabinets, the worklight is great, staying on for 17 seconds after releasing the trigger, this is a great plus when you get used to it. In demolition, it helps to find the old screws inside the dark cabinets. I've never had it power out, even driving #8 three inch screws.For my line of work, there is none better."
2,Be wary...,"Bought this drill a while back and initially I was very happy with it. Then I had problems with the trigger jamming, and the forward/reverse switch catching.I had that repaired, now its going again. Plus the chuck is now loosening.I am also hearing the sound of a motor rattling as it dies.A compact lightweight drill that is simply not an industrial tool, and not fit for the purpose.I am a Makita man through and through, and sorry, but Makita have let me down.Test your products before you put them on the market, boys.Update 20.oct.2010This drill is not dying, and still working fine with no further problems.I use it all the time, and yes, it is a good drill."
2,Good drill.... when it worked,"The drill broke after a few years of VERY LIGHT use, couple that with two DOA batteries a few more batteries that died after the first charge and you get a disappointed customer.I gave it two stars because it did perform well in the handful of times I used it and I like it's light weight.But I'm probably done with makita.Off to buy a new drill....."
1,Makita Power Tool Review -01,"-Excellent tools.-Factory defect in the LI-ON battery packs, which in essence, makes the tool package a very bad deal.-You will regret purchasing this Makita item because of the bad track record of the battery packs.Do your own research. Check the YouTube sites with the repair advice. They are correct, there is a problem with the battery packs.-Check the cost of replacing the battery packs, they are typically pushing $100/ea, if you include tax and shipping.-Until Makita takes responsibility for the design flaw, and corrects the problem, you would be ill advised to purchase any Makita LXT tool sets."
3,battery life,drill is all it is advertised --- check the date of manufacture on the batteries before you buy -- it is stamped in the casing on the connection side - first two numbers is month and last two is the year (04PT08 = April 2008) --- remember that lithium ion batteries only last 3-4 years -- my batteries were a year old when I bought the kit...it came with a third free battery which was 9 months old already...otherwise I am happy with it.
1,Awsome drill but batteries fail quickly.,"Awesome drill. The battery usage time, recharge, and power is great too. Problem is the batteries won't last long. My first battery failed with TWO WEEKS. I never got around to replacing it, so I'm out of luck. Figured I had one good one. After two years, the second battery failed. So consider this drill's batteries DISPOSABLE. Look at reviews for BL1815 battery to see what I mean.I called Makita hoping they would give me the model number of a replacement battery that works better (I was willing to purchase...just wanted better quality), and their unfriendly response was they don't have an issue, which surprised me. I figured after two years they would have worked the bugs out, and I thought they were a more reliable, consumer-oriented company. Anyone out there have recommendations on equal quality drill but better quality batteries...or do all Li-ION batteries have short shelf lives?"
5,It pays to ask,Fantastic drill.Only problem was differing voltage between Australia and USA (I forgot to check).A transformer took care of that and total price was still way cheaper.
5,Battery Replaced Free,Love the drill but after 6 months one of the batteries couldn't be charged. I sent it back to the Makita Service Center and they replaced it free of charge. I'm happy as long as both batteries keep working.
3,so-so,"Cute drill- nice and light, good power & ergo.. However, the 18v, 1.5ah battery doesn't do as much work as a 14.4v, 2ah battery and the plastic battery retention foot may crack if dropped { 3ft! }. Bulky charger, also. The kit w/ the impact driver is actually hard to pack. Maybe I should have purchased the pro model, but I didn't want the weight penalty."
4,"great tool, crummy batteries",great tool for all sorts of drilling jobs. batteries don't last as long as they should. will complain to makita.
3,Short Battery Life,This drill is very compact and lightweight but the battery life is not to great. The slower rpms is sonewhat irritating but the drill does perform very well.After 1 year of medium use the batteries failed.This is the trade-off between battery life and weight.
2,Nice drill - avoid the batteries,"Unfortunately I did not read about the problems with the Makita BL1815 (1.5Ah) battery. I wish I had.This drill kit gets two stars instead of 5 on account of the batteries. The kit comes with two 1.5 Ah batteries, and a promotional offer meant that Amazon threw in one extra for free.One of the three did not even charge once. The charger indicates that the battery is bad and refuses to charge it. I opened it up and all the cells measure fine. The charge fuse turned out to be blown so I replaced it, but it still won't charge.I'm now waiting for the next one to die...How a quality company like Makita dares to dirty its good name with such poor quality is beyond me."
2,Battery problem,I bought this item 2 years ago and the batteries fail as soon as warranty expires. I have replaced the batteries 3 times at a cost of $115 each. I think the charger is the culprit but cannot prove it. Buy a Panasonic or Bosch. Makita has lost my confidence and I will never buy another.
1,Save your money for another drill,This drill has the worst run out on the chuck of any drill I have seen hooked it to a dial indicater and it has over 10 thousands run out.The only thing it is good for is using with paddel bits. I would save your money for another cordless drill if you plan on using this for drilling or screw driving. It wobbels so the holes its drills are not round and tring to drive screws well better have a good screw starter. The only good points on this drill are its lite weight and its fast recharge time.
3,Damon Medic 's review,"Makita BDF452HW 18-Volt Compact Lithium-Ion Driver Drill Kit. This drill looks and feels awesome. It is convenient, lightweight, and easy to handle. Unfortunately, the batteries died after only two months of use, regardless of my religious charging. The batteries drained, and now I am kicking myself for getting a battery-charged drill! The new battery that Makita sells to make this drill continue to work, will cost me close to $100 bucks!!! Only electric drills for me from now on!-Damon Medic"
4,"Great drill, almost perfect...","I've had this drill for over a year now. I'm not a professional, but I am a hobby woodworker, so I've probably had a few more drills than the average home owner. This is the best drill I've ever had. It is light & well balanced, fits my hand perfectly (average size male hands), and the batteries start out incredible. The only reason I did not give it a perfect score is because the batteries both died eventually. I took them to the local Makita Factory Center here in Atlanta, and they replaced both of them no questions asked. Apparently this has been a common problem with some of the earlier versions. I don't know if this issue has been fixed, but I guess time will tell. Either way, as long they will stand behind their product like they did, I'll keep buying."
5,a positive experience with the Makita 18V Li ion compact drill,"This is a powerful, light weight, compact drill. I often work with 2 battery powered drills ..the other being a 14.4V Ryobi. The short 15 minute charge time stands out compared to the approximate 3 hr for the Ryobi so that recharging and switching batteries is a practical option when running high torque jobs. The Makita seems very solid and well thought out. While I have had it 3 months, most of the more demanding projects have been recent and in the past would probably have switched to a good Milwaukee corded drill."
3,Great for the homeowner,"So, it's not an industrial tool, but it gets the job done around the house. If you're a contractor, you should probably opt for their professional ine (cases are usually blue instead of this ugly silver). For example check out the BDF451. THat's an industrial tool which will probably (hopefully) be more reliable, has more power, and should be more precise. The silver stuff is made in China. However, not to hold that against them, it performs rather well. It has decent power. I returned it because the spindle doesn't exactly spin perfectly on axis (so you get a bit of wobble when driving screws, and skipping since it doesn't sit straight in the screw head as it turns). I have the BDF451 on order, and have higher hopes for it even though I am just a homeowner."
2,Great drill but beware battery life - expensive,"Love the drill but both batteries that came with it died just after the warranty and they are expensive - $69 apiece is the cheapest I have foundAs a comparison, a Makita 9v drill with nicad batteries has lasted me for over 12 years and is still going strong on the original batteries"
5,Ballsy light weight driver with LED light,"Makita has produced innovative and highly functional power tools for many decades. This latest driver replaced my aging Makita which was still working fine, but they no longer offer replacement batteries for it and the battery had reached the end of its life cycle.Makita is famous for innovation and the ergonomic innovations in this driver are remarkable; extremely well balanced; comfortable grip at multiple angles of use; short, small diameter, and narrow barrel on the driver motor enabling you to work in tight spaces easily; and best of all a bright LED that automatically goes on/off with use and points exactly at the end of the driver bit to facilitate easy alignment on jobs.The fast charge battery charger is good and it comes with a carry case and spare battery (total 2) making this a very good deal.Want quality? Look no further."
1,Makita 18.0 Volt Lithium Cordless Drill Review,"I bought the Makita 18.0 volt lithium-ion cordless drill when they first came out several years ago. Within 4 months, both batteries were toast. Not sure if the charger caused this or leaving the batteries on the charger for extended periods of time during winter. Based on this experience I would not buy another Makita cordless drill. I have owned other Makita drills with no problems and believe they make a good product, just not cordless drills with the lithium battery."
3,A Love/Hate Relationship,"I've had this drill for a few years now (not long after they first came out) - Love the Drill - HATE the battery life. I use this drill regularly - maybe 100 days a year. It's a great drill and I do love the the quick recharge on the batteries and the batteries deliver strong power until the last 5 seconds - really great. So what's wrong? You have keep replacing batteries and they cost way too much to have to keep replacing them. My first battery died 2 months past warranty. By this time, battery life for this divice was a known problem. I called Makita and tried to discuss the battery life problem with them, but their attitude was, ""It's past warranty and you just have to buy a new one"". My batteries keep dying just out of warranty, and by this time I could have purchase a one or two more drills for the cost of the batteries. Makita, I love you, but I can't afford to keep you any more!"
5,great tool,i have no complants about this drill. the only complant is with amazon you can buy this drill elsewere for the same price with free shipping every day of the yearlook for your self [...]
1,poor quality,"I have bought this drill motor before for my job and have had no issues. This time however was totally different. I bought it for my house and used it a couple times. When I went to slide the switch over to reverse, nothing happened. I went on Amazon's web site to exchange the drill, and was notified that they would only refund my money that the drill was out of stock. So i packed it up and sent it back to Amazon. Later that day I got an email advertisement saying I can purchase the same drill for $50 more than my refund. DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE GUYS ARE DOING BUT THAT IS WRONG. Like the drill, just got a defective one, not sure if I will be using Amazon again"
4,Makita BDF452HW cordless drill,"Overall a good unit. Good torque, speed & usability. Well balanced. Like the the LED light. The one drawback is that the batteries don't last a long time with continuous use. I.e. For driving a bunch of screws while building a deck. It works fine for how I use it. The charger is great! Really fast! Maybe 15 minutes to fully charge the dead battery. Makes up for the shorter battery usage time!"
5,Love it.,"Small, lightweight, powerful, batteries charge quickly, easy to change bits and adjust maximum torque. Love it."
4,Almost perfect...,"This is a very light and powerful drill. I owned it for a year now. I can carry it hanging on my tool belt without feeling the weight. Compact design let's it get into tighter spaces.On the negative side, the speed does not modulate well. It is as if the tool has a few speed steps, as you pull the trigger you can hear and see that the tool shifted into a higher ""gear"". In other words, the speed is not increasing in a slow continuous motion. It is making a few minor jumps.Also it is a bit noisier than I would like. It gets noisier as the speed ""shifts"" up. It has a higher pitch metalic sound to it as well. It is noisier than Bosch 18v brute for example.Noise and the speed issue however does not impact the usability as much. The compactness and light weight still makes it a good drill for my use. Therefore I rated it at 4 stars."
4,GREAT drill,"I am a serious DIYer and have done professional contracting in my past. I own two other cordless drills and this is by far my favorite. I chose it due to its light weight and smaller size over large hammer drill types that are heavy and wont fit into as tight a space. This is the one I reacy for 95% of the time.I would love to give this 5 stars but, like other reviewers, I have had both batteries fail in a matter of months (and now wonder if its because they were left on the charger). Makita replaced one, but the second I had to purchase a 3.0aH (larger) version. It works ok and runs longer, but is heavier.I love this drill, and recommend it to all but full time site contractors."
4,As advertised,"Everything I expected from Makita, so far. The driver came with two fully charged batteries, and in great condition for a factory reconditioned product. It is light and powerful, and the LED worklight is a nice addition. The compact size is very handy when working in tight quarters.The chuck covering is a little soft, and it got very scuffed up and is rough from doing some close work to a screw head. At least it looks used, now. The case is cheap and clunky, but I will be using a tool bag for storage and transportation. The biggest annoyance with this unit is the lack of on-board driver storage. I almost always have the phillips head bit in the chuck, anyway, but I was surprised to see there was no where to store even one bit on the body of the driver.At the price ($129), I think it is a tremendous bargain for a Li-Ion 18v driver from an industry leader. Good work, Makita."
2,good as long it last - short period,"BS""DOUR COMPANY PURCHASED 6 MONTHS AGO 40 OF THESENOW IT STARTS BREAKING 1 AFTER ANOTHERFOR PERSONAL USE IT'S A GOOD CHOICEDONT EVEN THINK OF GIVING FOR EMPLOYEES IT WILL BREAK ONE AFTER ANOTHER"
1,lightweight build for a lightweight tool,"After the batteries for my Porter-Cable cordless drill wouldn't hold a charge, I figured that it was time for a new one. This drill looked like a good choice based on reviews and my perception that Makita makes good stuff. Well, the drill lasted 3 months. I gave it a lot of use, but I expected a more durable tool (my Porter-Cable drill lasted over ten years). The drill is light weight and easy to handle, but it cannot hold up to the rigors of real use. We will see what the warranty service people will do for me. Until then, I have rebuilt the batteries for my Porter-Cable and it is still going strong."
4,"Good, but it could be better","I am satisfied with this the drill in general. Before I had a cordless Makita, which served for more that 10 years and this one looks very good. However most of today's drills have level on the back which makes vertical positioning easier, but this one doesn't. Another drawback is that the body is not smooth. It is covered with multitude of grooves and curves of different shape, which are quickly filled with dust and dirt."
5,Love it,"Well balanced and powerful. This drill is fun to use. I love the light that illuminates your workspace. Only thing I would wish for is a clip to hold a screw bit like my old drill had.UPDATE: Would like to change my rating to two stars:I absolutely love this drill, but the batteries are horrible. Within a couple months, both of the batteries no longer charged. Had a good experience with the warranty service, but, now a year later both batteries are dead again. Makita customer support acknowledged that this has been a persistent problem. They advise that you should not leave the battery on the charger (despite the advertisement that seems to imply that you should), nor should you let the battery die down to the point where it is almost dead. Before buying this drill, see the reviews forMakita BL1815 18-Volt 1.5 Ah Compact Lithium-Ion Battery."
2,Good Drill - BAD BATTERY,"I left the battery on the charger for a long time and all of sudden it's completely dead? The charger indicates that the battery is toast. The drill is good, but I'm reluctant to replace the battery or buy any more 18V Lithium Makita tools given the reputation they are earning. I give it two stars because my battery lasted two years (with minimal use). Now how about that Milwaukee? Hmmmm."
4,cordless drill,Drill is awesome! Has a great feel in your hand and has total versatility. Fast recharge on the batteries that last through any job. The light comes in handy too.
3,Good drill - poor battery,"I bought this drill to mix paint and thinset since it has a 1/2"" chuck and can accommodate a larger mixing paddle. I never got around to mixing thinset only paint in 5 gallon buckets. The battery died with less than 20 minutes of discontinuous use. I was charging the battery twice every hour. However, if you plan to use this drill for putting furniture together or hanging pictures it will work great but so would the Bosch PS20-2 since you don't need 450-inch/lbs. of torque or 1400 rpm to put a screw in the wall."
1,disapointing result,"After recieving my new Drill after delivery all the way to Australia, I was disapointed to find the Battery Charger was not Multi Voltage and designed only for the US power supply of 110 volts. I have been told that a replacement charger is more than I paid for the whole drill package. So I would urge anyone with a power supply of 220/240 volts to give this product a wide birth. Hope this helps someone, not make the mistake I made. regards Bryan"
2,Not working as presented!,"Factory recondition tags on everything, 2 batteries, charger & drill.1 battery was not in working order, seller replaced promply. No chargermanual, seller sent one with repalcement battery.Drill worked fine, used it for few prodjects. Time to charge batteries,DC18RA charger turns on then when battery is put in it goes to a red &green blinking condition and shuts off. No response yet from seller andMikita service has not given a yes or no on charger."
1,this thing sucks,2 days after i got it the motor fried. i had a dewalt that lasted me 5 years and this 2 days so you do the math i would rather get a dewalt
3,"Not bad, but..","It is a decent household drill/driver, but Makita was too cheap to include a bit holder. That is a huge omission in my opinion, exacerbated by the fact that the holders are not easily found. Batteries drain quickly (initial test was constant 1/2"" masonry drilling), but charged fast. If I had more consistent work (ie, contractor) to do I would not have bought this drill. Hell, I probably would not have bought it if I had known it didn't have a bit holder. That really torqued me."
3,Great drill -- beware the batteries/charger!,"I bought this drill in about January or February. The drill itself is great, but something is flakey with either the included 1.5AH batteries or my charger as extended stays in the charger have killed both my batteries (both with and without the charger plugged in!). Makita does not sell 1.5AH batteries, only 3.0AH replacements which are nearly $100 and twice the size of the 1.5AH units.I'd give this unit 5 stars if the batteries performed as they should have. I'm working with Makita on a battery and charger replacement as this is clearly a problem with this (my?) unit."
1,Kills batteries DEAD if left on charger. Skip this drill and look at the Milwaukee,"I have just returned my 3rd unit. There is a problem with the charger killing batteries that are left on it for extended periods of time. Even though the owners manual states you can leave batteries on the charger and the charger should ""maintain"" the battery. Once the batteries die you can not bring them back to life.Owners report this is a very common problem with this drill.My new drill is the Milwaukee 18v Li-Ion. Same price, does not kill batteries, and has a handy LED battery level gauge on the battery.Skip this drill and buy the Milwaukee for the same price. Plus the red Milwaukee does not show dirt and grim like the white Mikita."
2,"Nice Drill, Bad batteries.","After six months of use both 1.5ah batteries have died (one of them after 3 months) and will no longer charge. I purchased one 3.0ah battery ($80) and am satisfied with it. The size and features of the drill are great. I purchased separately the bit holders, it would have been nice if they were included. Amazon offered me 30% of the purchase price as a refund for the whole package, obviously not worth it. I guess I will contact Makita and see if they will do anything for me. Batteries should last longer than this."
2,battery issues,"One of the two batteries stopped accepting charges within six months of purchase. I'd probably used that battery 8-10 times for 10 or 15 minutes. I never got around to looking up where/when I'd purchased it, and now it's too late. Otherwise I love the drill, but it's a bit of a hassle to operate efficiently with just one battery."
1,Dead Battery POS Makita,"I bought this drill about eight months ago. I was looking for a more compact, light weight drill for cabinetry work. Initially I was pleased with the drill, it is light, compact, and ergonomic. The problem is about 30% to 40% of the time the battery will be dead when it is left in the charger. The green light will be on indicating that it is completely charge, but it is not. It seems to be getting progressively worse. I'm not a novice, and I know proper battery maintenance protocol. I've owned Dewalts, Panasonics and Milwaukees and have never had this problem. In checking the reviews I see that others have this same problem, and apparently Makita batteries are often troublesome. I'll keep using it despite this flaw, but I'll never buy another MakitaPOS again. Why play Russian roulette with your money and hope you get one that is reliable, there are plenty of good quality tools to choose from, By the way, 10 minutes ago I bought a Bosch cordless drill and grinder."
5,Long over due review,"I just wrote another review on a Makita drill/driver and I thought I'd provide an update on this set I purchased for my father in 07'. In short, it's 12' and it still running like it was brand new. Original batteries, I want to state that over the years, he has used this sporadically so many times the batteries are sitting with a charge, so no issues with long inactive times as far as holding charges or maintaining battery conditions.I added a Makita vacuum for my parents to use with these batteries. The batteries will benefit from the extra use and they will benefit with the extra time and power the cordless vacuum will provide."
5,Husband loves it,"My husband does lots of construction type work around the house himself. Builds sheds, stuff for the deck, etc. This drill is perfect. Charge holds, the power is there, and the drill doesn't ""die"" during the process. This drill is NOT for the average joe who is just doing light drilling..i.e. just using it to hang blinds."
3,lithium battery,"My 18 volt lithium battery just purchased doesent hold a charge for very long, and the 15 min. charger doesn't keep the battery charged when not in use. It has good strengh, but doesen't last very long."
5,Makita Lithium Ion,I am very happy with my 18V Makita Lithium Ion drill. It is very powerful and light weight. I use it on a daily basis driving screws and it has performed very well.
1,Horrible batteries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"Fully charged, it will drain the power out of the battery drilling one 3"" hole with a hole bit through thin flimsy vinyl siding and thin 1/2"" osb; then it's worthless. THe charger will often blink saying defective battery also. Just read the reviews for the batteries for these things! Needles to say I am returning the lemon. I also purchased the little in line 7.2 volt li-ion impact driver from makita and it is great, thank God."
3,Promises more than can deliver,"The introduction was intriguing, with its references to the paradoxical barbarity that had manifested itself in a highly educated society like Nazi Germany, but I had the impression that Calne tried to be too far reaching in his attempts to fit rationality in its proper place within human behavior. One of his basic premises is that rationality is not an end in itself, but rather a tool employed on the behalf of human instincts. While this certainly has a ring of truth to it, the thesis is by no means radical, which is why I wonder if abler attempts have been made to dissect the role of reason within human behavior. I would recommend skimming Calne's book if one had the opportunity to examine his major premises, but otherwise I was left dissatisfied by my sense that the topic he was trying to tackle was a much bigger fish than his line could handle."
2,Could have used a reasonable editor,"The core argument of this book, that reason or rational thinking is a value-free activity, which we can put to whatever use we please, is indisputable. At the same time, I think there is great value in stating the argument as directly as this book does. However, the discussion in the book is often reductive, digressive at best, scattered at worst. In addition, the author's own phobias and neuroses are frequently on display (a rather morbid view of sex is an example). A good editor probably could have done wonders to focus the author's work and eliminate some of the overt weirdness.The subject deserves a more nuanced and better edited discussion."
2,not what I expected,"I expected the author to discuss the relation between reason and goodness, especially since he raises the provocative paradox early in the book about how very intelligent and reasonable people can do bad and evil things. His thesis is that reason/intelligence/science is morally neutral, and that our behavior is motivated by instinct, independent of our intellects. So he ends up explaining all the puzzling aspects of human behavior as instinctive: psychopaths lack brain module X, religious people have overactive brain module Y., etc. The result is intellectually unsatisfying. The author leaves us with no rationaL criteria to classify actions as right or wrong, good or bad. I far prefer Brand Blanshard's Reason and Goodness (1966) on this topic."
4,"Good, even with its flaws","Look, this is not the most well-written book (Calne is a scientist after all, not a writer). It's not the best page-turner either.But the reason this is a good book is because of its thesis and subsequent discussion of rationality and its psychological correlates. There aren't enough books out there that deal with this, so it's a swig of cold water to read this one.Of course, David Hume came to these same conclusions almost 4 centuries ago. The insight is not what's original, but the attempt to anchor it within the scientific (rather than philosophic) framework is. The implications of the idea that Reason is just a tool for getting what we want are significant for philosophy (especially ethics and political philosophy). Read the book; skim it if necessary, but it is worth your money."
2,Strangely free of useful content,"This book is more of a manifesto than an education. Calne sets forth statements with which I largely agree, while giving short shrift to the basis for those statements and even less attention to the consequences of the truth of those statements.This is not a book about why we should agree with Calne, and it is not a book about what people who agree with Calne should do -- it is merely a book explaining what Calne believes. I was in the market for a book that gives his fellow-travellers, like me, some ammunition for argument and discussion, and even some things to think about. But this is not that book. At best, it's preaching to the choir."
1,Limitations,"It is possible that the unit I received was defective, but the advertised range of 80 feet was not achievable. It could get a signal between the rain collector and the monitor within 10 feet, but at that distance you are standing outside and you can SEE it is raining. When you lose the signal the display reads ""---"" and the only way of re-setting it is by taking out the batteries and going through the set up again. I called the non-toll free ""help"" line and was on hold for 5 minutes after which the call was transferred to a mailbox that was full and could take no more messages so I returned it."
2,Defective after 6 months of use.,I like the 6 day or 6 week graph. I just hope it could be better constructed. Mine is about 6 months old. Not been dropped. All of a sudden it just stopped working.
1,Dissapointed,"This moniter failed to report the most significant rainfall ever recorded in my area. Tropical depression Gaston roared through on 8/30/04 and the monitor lost signal and failed to report the over 7 inches of rain that fell at my home. Luckily I had the trusty manual gage still outside. I have sent the product back and hope that I get a refund. Oh, by the way, now that it is the next morning it seems to be working fine. I can only conclude that the rain caused the receiver to be unable to receive from the transmitter. Very problamatic for an item that needs to be in the rain in order to do what it claims to do."
1,Incredibly Unreliable,"The specs look very good, so I bought my first of these on the recommendation of a friend who had one that had worked for several months. After a few months, mine began measuring intermittently - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it only registered 1/2 the actual rainfall.Since my friend's unit was still working fine, I figured mine was a fluke and bought another one. This one worked for two months and then reported that it had lost the transmitter signal. I could not make it work reliably at any distance - and not at all if the receiver was more than 3 feet from the gauge.I have since learned that my friend's unit quit working with the same symptoms. That's strike 3. I'd say that 0 for 3 is a really lousy record for LaCrosse QC."
1,DONT BUY IT!!,I tried 2 of these. The first one jumped up to 40 inches on the display when it lightninged during a thunderstorm. So i sent it back and the 2nd one did the same thing. Also to change the batteries in the gauge you have to take the gauge off the mount. Not good if its mounted on your roof. So i sent it back and got the wired one. They said the wired one tipped at 1/100th of a inch. It tips at 2/100ths. Oh well. Thats better than Oregons that tips at 4/100ths.
1,Unreliable,"Bought the rain gauge and within 9 months after working flawlessly it just plain stopped. Sent it back, received another unit and within 6 months totally inaccurate. As an example, yesterdays rainfall was 0.42 inches and this unit registered 0.04. The day before it recorded one half of the actual amount."
2,"Idea is nice, but only works once and a while","Nice Toy, but that's because that's what it is. If really want a instrument that accurately measures the actual amount of rainfall and history just outside, you best get a glass tube and a pad and pencil. Le Crosse makes some great products, but this one just isn't one of them. Unfortunately, it stops working just when you're most interested in having it do so. Don't confuse this with a weather station that could cost over $500. See the other reviews about battery change design flaw. Other than this, if the price is right the thing could be a nice gadget gift for those that aren't all that serious about the true amount of rain."
2,Worked Great for about 18 Months,"If I would have reviewed this rain monitor about four months ago I would have given it four stars with the only downfall being its short range. It would only transmit through one wall of our house. But three months ago the display just quit showing numbers. I replace the batteries in both units, made sure there were no mechanical problems and still nothing. Our replacement unit, made by Oregon Scientific. transmits all the way to the far room in our house."
3,Limited Footnotes in Leather Edition,"The leather edition of the New Jerusalem Bible does not contain the extensive footnotes that are noted in the reviews of the hardcover and paperback versions. The box containing this volume states that this version has ""NJB translators footnotes throughout."" Note well that these footnotes are only about two or three words in length and typically refer only to alternate translations of words. The footnotes (sometimes requiring a half-page) that I had expected to find were not in this edition."
4,A Good Source,"I was looking for an English translation that would be the closest to the Latin translation of the New Testament Greek. I did not want the modern, inclusive language."
3,Footnotes,"This Bible is okay but, I like a bible with footnotes. The Bible is hard enough to understand, and reading footnotes helps a lot. I have since given this Bible away, and purchased ""The New American Bible"", it's really complete."
2,Need to get rid of inclusive language,I bought this translation hoping it would be like the Jeruasalem Bible. While it is poetic I find it almost unuseable because of the inclusive language. I'm getting rid of this translation in favor of St Ignatius RSV 2nd Edition.
2,So-So,"Perhaps I've been spoiled with the French translation, but I find that the English translation (original and revised) can't hold a candle to the most recent French revision (2001).Not only does the French translation render the passages more literally, but it maintains the Latin Vulgate tradition in many places. Examples of the former include (and I translate from the French): ""In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was waste and void, darkness covered the abyss, and God's breath was hovering over the waters"" and ""the Word was made flesh and camped among us."" Examples of the latter include (and again I translate from the French): ""Rejoice, filled with grace, the Lord is with you"" and ""let him be anathema""I should note that the French translation also maintains traditional Hebrew, Greek, and Roman units of measurement and monetary nomenclature, which I prefer to the English translation's attempt to approximate."
2,Service too slow,The book arrived nearly a month after the sender promised it.The Jerusalem Bible : New Testament
1,A disapointment...DON'T buy this if you want NOTES .,"A huge disapointment. I'm a devout Catholic and studied in Italy for 4 years and studied with LA BIBBIA DI GERUSALEMME - created by the CEI. This one is a translation of that text BUT this this bible doesn't have ANY notes and that's criminal. What makes LA BIBBIA DI GERUSALEMME great are FOOT NOTES that helps the reader to understand the context, translations,culture of time...and a lot more. If you're looking for the same bible with the foot notes you'll need an older version of this. Look here at Amazon ( link doesn't work) , look for this ISBN-13: 978-0385142649 , hard cover 1985 edition . The CEI just lunched the new edition 2010 of La Bibbia di Gerusalemme, and translations for Europe and Latin America. Why can we have the same great bible???????? It's an insult to all of us catholics and other christians looking for a great bible."
4,GOOD CATHOLIC BIBLE,"Actually I was hoping this version was like the 1966 version as listed in my Scriptural Rosary booklet, but alas, it isn't. Still, this bible is great for me as I cross compare to other versions in my studies."
4,"I have many bibles, different bibles",I bought this one because I was assured this bible was easier to read....more lyrical. It's ok but I'm gradually making my way through it.
5,Readable Translation,"This accurate and readable translation should be in every Bible student's library. Check out Psalm 4: ""Realize that Yahweh performs wonders for His faithful."" What a wonderful verse! Psalm 143: ""Show me the road that I must travel for You to relieve my heart."" These are just two verses that are translated beautifully and quite differently from KJV and NIV texts. An added plus is the use of El Shaddai, or Shaddai, around 30 times in Job; and the NJB's liberal use of the other Names of God where appropriate. Wonderful for meditational purposes - this version will feed your heart like no other."
1,Horrible PC translation.,"This disastrous translation truly does harm to the Word of God by its insistent use of politically correct ""inclusive language."" We can only hope that with the promulgation of Liturgiam Authenticam, this kind of garbage will no longer be foisted upon English-speaking Catholics."
5,Easy Reading,"The Bible is the most read book in the world. But this particular translation is in our current English Language, not an old translation. It is easy to read. The material is good and the size is ideal. God Bless you all!!"
3,Good Reference But Lacking,"See my review of the original 1966 Doubleday Jerusalem Bible which is the one to get. This version is an abridged and updated version that lacks the real substance of the Jerusalem Bible, namely the historical and contextual notations (footnotes). It is a good reference and inexpensive enough to have on hand. Still, get the original if you can find one."
4,excellent study notes!,"All in all, a good edition of the Scriptures. The study notes and book introductions are the best that I have ever seen. They are thorough, critical, scholarly, and firmly grounded in the Catholic tradition without surrendering too much to current liberal protestant scholarship.The translation is good, readable, and elegant. However, the use of inclusive language is questionable (though it is not as excessive as the NRSV) and also the use of ""Yaweh"" instead up substituting ""Adonai"" for the divine name is potentially offensive to Jewish readers and hinders some of the eloquence of the Old Testament readings. I highly recommend this Bible to be used with the New Oxford Annotated Bible (Revised Standard Version, NOT the NRSV)."
5,This is the most important bible to own.,"The scholarship is excellent. The prose is precise. The footnotes are extremely helpful in understanding the translation. The version of this bible without the footnotes is still very good, however, the footnotes provide important insights into the text. If you only own one bible, or you want to give a bible to someone, this is that bible."
3,very nice,"Very nice and easy to understand. My one complaint is that if I use a highliter marker, the paper is thin and the marker 'bleeds'. Other than that, this is a wonderful Bible."
3,No notes.,"Even though this is the ""Standard edition"" of the New Jerusalem Bible, it is not the version with introductions and extensive notes.I have since found another ""Standard edition"" which does have the notes."
5,We have two-hard and soft cover.WONDERFUL!,"A pleasure to read and study,so understandable,makes one wan to get to it"
3,lukewarm beginning,"The two books I read last week both use the vast wilderness of Alaska as a backdrop. To me, ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer was a much better book. We are told on the jacket of ""The Woman Who Married a Bear: An Alaska Mystery,"" that author John ""Straley has studied poetry with Nelson Bentley at the University of Washington and fiction with James Welch."" The result is a stilted, self-conscious writing style - trying too hard to write pretty and balance precariously between Raymond Chandler and Kent Haruf. The painfully obvious writing striations detract from the story flow. This is literature that just happens to be a murder mystery and not vice versa. Maybe the author mellows out in subsequent books?"
3,Slow Read But Well Done,"This book was extremely long. I skipped through parts of the first half. It got interesting to me during the second half. I was disappointed with the selection of photos. I wanted to see more. The writer did cover a lot of information. The research was well done. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in Nat King Cole."
3,How high is the actual platform?,"I read the info presented and I am interested. It is listed as 5', but is the 5' at the top of the guardrail, or is the 5' at the work platform, where a person's feet are? The description needs to be more specific. Unless the info is given, I don't think many people would want to buy one. I wouldn't buy without the facts."
4,Tough read...,"I really enjoy the Em Hanson books and would have easily given the other books in the series 5 stars, but this book is far too technical for the average reader. At times, I felt like I was reading a miner's manual. For me, all of the explanations of mining procedures, chemical analysis and mineral analysis did not add to the story. I found myself skipping over many paragraphs then would have to back up and reread. That got very tedious."
4,Surprisingly Refreshing,"I thoroughly enjoyed An Eye for Gold. I read the book for my geology class, but I found myself not being ble to put it down. Structurally, the writing style was unique, but because we discuss a lot of the subject matter in class, I found it more interesting. The biggest hinderance to me was her plot structure because it wasn't the traditional conflict-climax-resolution, but once I got past that I found it to be a real page turner."
3,As an Editor Myself,"I would have enjoyed more of Sarah Andrews' books on my Kindle, but after seeing what a terrrible typist did to this book, I can understand why Andrews would balk at any more being produced. I hope the paperbacks/hardbacks are not of the same caliber."
5,the author/actor is over 70 years old,"I spent a lazy saturday afternoon watching this video for some knowledge of construction. I am interested in doing light handyman, remodeling work at my house, so this video was definitely beyond my knowledge. But I decided, why not learn something new. What I saw were two old guys framing a one story house and they were very fast in what they did, but very accurate and knowledgeable. After I watched the video I did a google search of the authors and found out the older brother was born around 1930 and has been doing framing work for all his life. The guy is a PRO. Anyone looking to do framing work should take a look at this video. For someone with absolutely no knowledge, this video may be a bit complicated. The video is more suited for someone with some ""hands on"" work, and some carpentry skills. 5 stars."
3,framing walls,i was hoping to see more on framing. i notice a new type of framing in new houses today.in new home building .some framer use 4x4 in their framing.
5,Good tutorial to learn and practice shell programming.,"In addition to clearly explaining the syntax and semantics of shell programming constructs, this book has useful coverage on UNIX process prioritization concepts, awk and sed. Other than lacking a few issues like possibilities of global shell variable substitution inside regular expressions of AWK and SED patterns, I found this book real value for money. It was easy to understand and practice on my Linux system."
2,not what i expected ......,"Great for the first time shell user, but if you know your way around @ all ....... you'll find more info in the man pages --- this is one of those long, drawn out lesson by lesson books.....By the end of the book --- you really haven't learned more than you could from any of the various ""bible or unleashed"" books ... except this is non-distro specifac .....Waste of Money"
3,"Summary of sh,ksh,etc programming and simple unix tools","Summary of sh,ksh,etc programming and simple unix tools"
2,Too many typos,"its abit surprise for me no one ever pointed out the amount of typos in the book. i found many typos esp. from the chapter 12 in both explanations and examples. well... no complex examples are presented in the book so you may easily correct the errors but, it is not something i expected from the 5 star rated book from many guys. so i give it 2 stars to be fair. you are gonna end up spending extra times to correct the errors."
4,Good to have,I have not used shell scripting in the long time. I ordered this book and it helps me refresh a lot about Unix and shell scripting leanrt in school many years ago as undergraduate student. The book is well-written and will keep you excited. One important thing is: practice as you are reading. By the time you finish the book you should be able to grab much from the book. I downloaded the Sun Solaris 9 that I installed on x86 computer and I am playing with some flavors of shell writing small shell scripts.
2,too much vibrato,The Deller Consort recordings of Gesualdo always have too much vibrato for medieveal music which serves only to loose the sense of stunning Gesualdo harmonies...
4,The mellow side of Don Carlo Gesualdo,Don't expect the weirdness of the madrigals. Here it's smooth sailing all the way. Lovely pieces performed well by the Deller Consort. Only 4 stars because I don't have anything to compare it to.
4,Elizabeth and Catherine: empresses of all the Russias,"It is a very interesting read, both historically as well as from human behavior aspects. A good narrative and informative style."
3,use online sources instead?,"A lightweight and potentially handy companion to a practising engineer or engineering student. The most common terms in materials science are covered here, in clear, technical descriptions. Space considerations of course preclude any extensive detail. But if you already knew the information from earlier studies, then the dictionary is a good memory aid.Though some of you may have a nagging qualm about books like this, these days. Given the access to the Internet that most of us have, you might be able to find online resource portals with the equivalent information, at no cost."
1,Nothing New,I was expecting a greater insight into how the foods we eat affect us and was very disappointed. There are some new insights but overall I found the concepts to be very similar to those promoted in food combining. The only difference I saw was that in GI you combine foods that will keep your sugar level at an acceptable level longer. While food combining focuses on combining foods so that your digestive system can efficiently remove the nutrients and release the energy.
5,Living the GI Diet,"Great Diet book to follow, which is not really a diet but a change in a healthy way of eating."
5,GI diet,Rick Gallop offers a helpful guide to glycemic index based eating. His color system of foods makes the process extremely easy to follow and the recipes are a wonderful help.
5,review GI Index cookbook,Enjoyable for the newbee. The traffic light system for allowed foods is simple yet genius. This should be your first cookbook to GI Index diet .....
5,Not a diet but a lifestyle,"Even since I have been on this diet I have lost inches around my waist. Been on the awful Atkins Diet, the Atkins diet made me gain weight and I followed it religiously. This G.I diet is the way to go. Not some high fat and protein diet that ruins your organs. This diet is really good for diabetics as well."
2,disappointed,"I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review. I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer. After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side. What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings? I will return the unit.Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious."
2,LaCrosse loses its power,"We have had the La Cross WS-7391UG wireless weather station since Christmas. It has lost its capacity to show accurate weather 3 times and we have had to reconnect and change batteries each time. The last time was February 9, 2008. We shall see how long the accuracy lasts this time around. Not 100% satisfied with the technology."
1,Poor Quality - Can See Why It Is On Sale,I have had Amazon ship me two different units. Both had serious LCD screen issues. There was no syncing with the atomic clock and the humidity readings were way off. I have just arranged to send the second unit back for a refund. Try another product.
3,Sunshine or Rain?,I've owned this for about a month now - I haven't compared the readings to other instruments but it seems fairly accurate until today - it is pouring rain in Austin - but the weather station shows a sun over two clouds. Nice size and finish - should meet my requirements.
3,Rocket 88 and some other stuff,"The best of Ike Turner/I like Ike: Ike Turner's importance in the development of Rock n Roll is undeniable (although many these days try to ignore it) but as important as his early sides are, they are certainly dated. This CD is one to get if you are a Rock historian, but it is not the most entertaining of albums to hear."
3,just a hunk of cheap plastic,this is a cool toy i will admit but its really not that good quility it was a good WASTE of money.... it isnt well detailed at all.
2,Not as good as I expected.,Very loose on the phone. I have to remove the case before taking pictures. The phone actually slipped out of the case and hit the pavement. I am not even using the case at this time. Did not plan on writing a review until Amazon requested that I do so. I just ordered a clip without a case. This will be better than using this case at all. The clip sells here on Amazon also.
1,Got what I paid for.,"Belt lasted about a month. Grommets started falling out causing belt to tear apart. ""leather"" cracked within a week of use."
2,Turth of Dare?,"Paul is a new student at a preppy private high school. As the new kid, who doesn't fit in, Paul is subjected to bullying from the other students.When Paul is absorbed into the ""in"" crowd by the leader, Charlie Good, he becomes accepted. But his acceptance comes at a price. Compromising his morals and judgement, Paul soon succumbs to whatever Charlie asks in order to be popular. The trouble starts with simple theft and grade changes, but how will he handle it when Charlie asks Paul to plant a bomb in the school?I dislike the way the author handles the consequences dealt out to Paul and Charlie. It seems to follow the theory that ""money talks"". Paul is punished for his part in the bombing plan while Charlie walks away scott-free. I find it irresponsible to teach kids that they can get away with criminal actions."
3,Bleh...,"First off, I loved her book, Nothing to Lose. I just have to say that some of the issues in this book I would not let a child read. I think this book tells the reader that being influenced by peer pressure is the right way to earn friends and gain a social status, but this is not the way to make friends at all. Even though at the end of the book he has suffered the consequences of peer pressure first hand by being drunk, breaking the law more than once, and going to jail, I still think that some could get mistaken and get the wrong concept of this book. By the end, it explains that peer pressure is wrong and the influences by it are great, but I would never let my child read this book."
5,Great teen book,"This book is an excellent look at the manipulation and violence that occurs not just at inner city schools,but private expesnive ones as well."
5,right on target,"Shreve did a great job in demonstrating the way a child with ADD makes poor choices. As the mother of three grown ADD children, I can only wish this book had been written sooner. The storyline is very accurate, and I believe it might serve as an awakening, of sorts, to kids who have been diagnosed with ADD. They will certainly be able to see themselves in the characters of Ben and Trout. And it should be encouraging to parents to at least give medication a try."
4,Comprehensive study -- but not full text,"Any medievalist will undoubtedly find William of Malmesbury's Gesta cited throughout the footnotes of other studies. This volume provides a comprehensive commentary and analysis of the Malmesbury manuscripts, equal in every respect to the high standard expected from Oxford Medieval Texts.Be forwarned, however, that this volume contains only the commentary. Those interested in reading the excellent full-text English translation, or making their own interpretation from the Latin will require the companion Volume I, which for some reason, Amazon does not include in its catalogue listings."
2,Single Ice Age Theory won't stay frozen,"In this book, young earth creationist Michael Oard (known as Mr. Ice Age) presents his one Ice Age theory (caused by the Flood). He fails to take all the effects of his theory into account, making it unworkable. He feeds his Ice Age with massive amounts of volcanics, but he does not consider that a byproduct of volcanic activity is carbon dioxide. In reality, instead of causing an Ice Age, Noah and his family would have been roasted alive.This is just one problem of many. As is usual in young earth books, the young earth reader is supposed to accept the words of this ""expert"" without question. If one is willing to look beneath the surface, insurmountable problems arise."
5,The whole 7 CD set is DA BOMB!!!!,I have the whole set (7 CD's)and it is the bomb. You get jam after jam. I promise that you may not like no more than two song on each CD and that is only on maybe one or two of the 7 CD set. I would recommend this set to anyone who loves the soul music of the late 70' early 80's. BUY THIS WHOLE SET NOW. YOU CAN HAVE A OLD SCHOOOL PARTY AND PLAY THIS WHOLE SET AND NOTHING ELSE. This set will make you run out the room because it is so funky.I really have enjoyed these CD's and I have started to purchase the greatest hits collections of the artists on this set and I am turning into a old school collector.Excuse me while I get my funk on!Holla at ya Boy if ya don't like it.
1,"DON""T GET THESE TWO BOOKS CONFUSED","The overview of the book is for Computation Mthods of Neutron Transport. written by E.E. Lewis and W.F. Miller, Jr. An excellent book on neutron transport and the Boltzamann equation. I don't know anythin about nuclear fuels - and was looking for a book on Neutron transport and Amamzon.com's web-site seems to have mixed the two books up."
4,it gets in your head...and that ain't bad,If you love Jewish Music or surf guitar... you will have a new favorite album. It got my Dad's toes tapping... and I don't think he ever liked either Jewish Music or Surf Guitar... so anyone may like it. It is that good.Enjoy.
5,"Magical, Mystical, great for quiet moments..","I use this CD allot for work, I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and my clients always comment on this selection!! A Great Choice!Alan C. Lemieux LMT"
4,Great relaxation,My massage therapist uses this cd quite often. It is relaxing and brings a feel of tranquility.
3,Native American Flute,Beautiful Native American Flute. Nakai manages to produce one of the best recordings extant.
2,The lock is junk and does not work,"We purchased this for the locking function, and it does not work. The keys are extremely soft, and the first time we locked it (which took a lot of wiggling the key and trial and error) and then tried to unlock it, the key bent and it took forever to get it out. We had to throw that key away, and then we were VERY gentle and careful with the second key - but again, after finally getting it to lock, it resisted being unlocked, and we had to wiggle the key and try numerous times (and any time we had any resistance at all when turning, we stopped, because we didn't want this key to bend)- when we finally got it unlocked, the tooth on the key was bent. The next time we locked it, it took so long to get it to unlock we didn't think it was going to open. We finally did get it to open, but we can't use the lock because of all of this. Would not have purchased this had we known the lock was so cheap and non-functional."
4,A nice option for storage,"We got this for use as a coffee table in our tiny NYC apartment. We have had to utilize every bit of storage possible as there is little closet space, and this trunk has really helped a lot. We have used it to store a ton of items, and it also serves as a very nice looking living room centerpiece."
3,Still Funny,Some good laughs. Would never pass muster in today's creepy PC world.Hobson is the best.Picture quality was fantastic.
4,Works well - very cool.,"We've had this for about a month. Already own a LaCrosse weather station that is wonderful, so no complaints about the company. Setup was easy - the hardest thing was waiting for the rain to stop so I could hang the outside sensor. Time syncs to the atomic clock every night - it's the most accurate clock in the house. Projection is easy to read (8' ceilings) even with the glow from the TV.I chose this over one from Hammacher Schlemmer that was $40 more expensive. Worth the money."
4,La crosse technology,hard to use and understand how to set up but once it is done its a pretty nice tool. I wish it did more but for the price I love to see it display the time for like 30seconds then it goes to temp for 30 seconds. Believe me when this product ever breaks down I will miss it but I really would like a more friendly one with more accurate weather information. Great product for the price. I like it. Dont love it but really I would miss it if It stopped working.
4,Good but not perfect,"Purchased to replace a projection clock that died. Once set up, it picks up the time signal quite well and has excellent reception from the outdoor sensor about 35' away. The only issue is that for MY taste, the light could be a little brighter when the snooze button is pressed and the INSIDE temperature could stay on a little longer. Otherwise an excellent clock that performs as expected."
3,Cool Clock,I love all the features of the clock. Only problem i found was that the display on the wall was way too small.
3,good but could be better,"Works well but has a few drawbacks. I had no problem syncing the time, I just left it overnight and the next morning it was set. The outdoor temp feature has been pretty accurate so far. I've had it for a week and it is always within 2-3 degrees of the weatherbug temp. However, the drawbacks are that it has no constant backlight, so it is difficult to read the time during the dark, you have to press teh snooze button to make the backlight show, which only lasts a few seconds anyway. It wouldn't be a problem since there is a projection feature, however, the projection is too small for me since I wear glasses so I can't read the time during the night without my glasses. And the projection isn't very bright so even a little bit of light in the morning will prevent you from seeing the projection. Overall, its an alright clock, especially if you don't wear glasses, but I would have prefered a clock with a constant backlight and larger and brighter projection."
3,Not the best Alarm Clock,This alarm clock is more of a travel model than a permanent one. The external temp has never worked. The backlight does not stay on for more the 10 seconds. It does not have enough buttons to easily set and use it. There is only one volume for the alarm. The projector does work well. It is much smaller than I expected. If you are looking for a great travel alarm this will do more than you need. If this is something you plan on using everyday please look elsewhere.
2,Three levels of Dim,The clock is just fine with the exception of the intensity of the projection. For some reason the projector has 3 levels of intensity from just visible in a dark room to invisible. I like the display and the ability to rotate it. If only I could see it.
5,Excellent product,Extreme accurate and very handy at night due to the projection feature. You can project the time to the ceiling without turning your head. highly recommend!
5,Pro Artist...Patsy Cline 1,I received the shipment faster than anticipated. The quality was excellent. Chartbuster makes a good product. I am very pleased.
1,"Chartbuster Karaoke is terrible, but shipper is great!","I received the product in the time specified and it was in good condition. The music itself was nothing like Patsy Cline and cannot be blamed on the shipper. I would not order Chartbuster Karaoke again, but the shipper did their part. I rated the product not the shipper. Shipper gets 5 stars, product really deserves no stars!"
3,Interesting,"My husband, at the time, is bipolar. This was an eye-opening movie he didn't want to watch because it was uncomfortable for him. But he watched it and needed to hear it's message."
4,Brave,"This is a very bold and unflinching look at the trauma and desperation that individuals and their families can suffer when dealing with a mental health issue such as bipolar disorder. It is hard to watch and it brings up many feelings, but this is a fine piece of filmmaking. I would caution viewers, though, as it is not meant to be simply entertaining, and it has moments that are so poignant that they become unbearable."
1,It looked like fun,"After following the directions meticulously, the outside Temperature remained 20 degrees hot, and the outside humidity was 20% off.I live 1/4 of a mile from a government managed FAA weather station that local media monitor.I gave it three days,& reset it countless times.The worst part is there is NO support from LaCross. You listen to an endless recording, and when you eventually select this item, you get a recording that says they will call you back. NOT! Try it: 1-507-895-7095. If only for this reason, I will not invest my money in any LaCross products.Save your money or invest in a better system.I'm looking a Oregon Scientific.Please review the items you buy here, so others can share in your experiance.I've returned this unit to Amazon."
2,Boring,"I don't know how widely read this book is, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't. It's pretty dry and doesn't really convey the tenants of Animal Behavior in a memorable or accessible manner."
1,Rip Off!,"This company has to be the worst!I have over $6,000 of fittings in my bathroom. Fittings are less than 3 years old. needed to replace shower cartridge $250 and a plastic diverter in the tub faucet sheared, the part could not be worth more than $10, the customer service rep gave me the part number and told me to find a local dealer. The dealer had the part but it was the wrong part. Called customer service again and explained it was not the $60 spindle I was looking for it was the small plastic diverter that the spindle turns... the rep told me that part is not available and I should buy a complete new faucet ($1,300).I asked about warranty and was told if I don't have original receipt (I don't) to buy a complete new set. I wrote to the company... no reply. I addressed a note to the president of the company... no reply.Over priced poorly engineered, and company not at all interested in customers. NEVER deal with Newport Brass."
4,Used but came in very good condition,"No original box, but everything came as expected. Using it on my original PS3 and is working perfectly, even for PS2 game. You need to a PS2 to PS3 adaptor though, but I anticipated as such."
5,Excellent coverage,"This product is exactly as advertised. It is clear, audible, and easy to use. It has three volume levels and range sufficient to reach anywhere in my house. I use it to alert me to items like door bell and phone when I am upstairs."
5,You get a rare jewel of a book in Africa Adorned,"Angela Fisher spent seven years criss-crossing Africa, seeking out traditional forms and styles of jewelry and body adornment. The metal crafting, artistic modes and affectations of traditional piercings are stunning. The more extreme examples of African body art are already missing: cutting and/or scarring, limb binding (neck/arms/legs) and lip stretching are lost arts these days.The photography is top notch, with highly detailed closeups and oversize, full-color images on most pages. Notes are included for each image, with geography, tribal information and craftsman's details for many pieces.This is a great example of the ""coffee table"" book. I checked this title out of the library while in graduate school repeatedly until my mother gifted me with my own copy (thanks, Mom!). For artists and jewelers, this volume will be an endless source of inspiration."
5,Very Interesting Book,"I found this book to be amazing...I loved the discussion about the different African cultures and most especially the pictures--I'm even considering purchasing another copy of this book just so I could frame some of the beautiful, highly colorful pictures. I am buying more books from those authors--I expect the other books to be just as beautiful and informative."
4,A fine set of shorts for pleasure or business.,"The description of 'Seven Little Ducks' implies there will be some form of cruelty. There isn't, thankfully, but it's still cruelly painful to watch, like a lot of the shorts the guys have done over the years. I can certainly relate to open-ended 'Decisions, Decisions' because I was that dork who almost became great friends with a cool kid. Now I lead a sad and lonely existence. I still blame him!Looking back on these types of so-called educational films, it's a wonder we haven't slipped into anarchy sooner. They truly are pathetic and useless attempts to keep kids occupied while teacher slips out for a nip of gin in the private lounge."
3,entertaining,"Not the best the book I have read of Manfredi, but entertaining. Under the veil of fiction it reviews a hypothetical incursion of a few Romans in the Chinese Empire. For better books of Manfredi read Alexander."
3,Author had nice idea for the novel,"Nice historical novel. Small comparison of Imperian Roman Empire and China under Han dynasty can be easily found in this book. When the action of this novel takes place in China it is clearly seen that Manfredi likes fantasy-like motifs, which he gently introduced to his book. The idea for this novel was really ambitious, but not all of its elements work properly. This book shows that you cannot be a master in every subject. Nice read."
4,I spent a whole sunday reading it and it was worthwhile !,I think that if you take it as a novel it's great.As far as entertainment is concerned I liked it.I did have a good time reading it.
2,Disappointing after the Alexander series,"I am interested in the Far East as well as ancient Europe so I had hopes that the book would be as good as the author's Alexander historical fiction. Not!! I forgive the preposterous plot, but not the constant tipping of the hand to the final outcome of the story. And the coy allusions (""..he found the offered infusion of leaves strangely enjoyable..."") that's Chinese tea, of all things. Not recommended."
3,OK,This old style is bulky. The outdated PDA pocket can get in the way and add bulk. OK for certain needs. The quality seems good.
3,Zip Folio,"I got this for a gift and was a little disappointed. The case was just okay, and had a really cheap tablet in it. The quality wasn't quite what I'd hoped for."
1,Junior Pad/Zip Folio (executive or business) A4 paper will not fit,"Its smaller than the regular portfolio. A4 size paper will not fit even if folded in half. Description on Amazon differs from description onf Beach Camera website site which clearly describd it as "" Wenger Swiss Gear Leather PDA Black Junior Zip-Folio Case""."
5,The Overflow from a Classic,"The three volume work on Matthew that this author along with Davies did in the International Critical Commentary is oftentimes the final court of appeal for just about any exegetical issue that comes up in the Gospel. Evangelicals may have to bite their lip at times, but the experience is worth it to savor all that those volumes say. Now, how would you like to get ""the rest of the story"" that Dale Allison couldn't include, even in those three volumes? Well, here it is - the overflow of years of thought on this book. Allison learned that the Fathers had something worthwhile to say about this Gospel, and he tells you what that is. His discussion of the ""star"" of Bethlehem made me want to re-write a chapter in one of my own books! If you are writing on Matthew or preaching through it, you must get this volume. It will stimulate you to fresh thoughts as well as take you down old paths that have been neglected."
5,Again a great resource,"We use some of the exercises in this book in our support group for people in helping professions, which is aimed at addressing burnout and compassion fatigue. I really have had some good results with it."
4,A practical need for Spare Air,"This is just fine and works well. I would have given it a 5*, but this is so fundamental to the Spare Air that it should not be an add on. It's like the proverbial nightmare story of a car dealership selling you a car and asking you if you want tires for it. You need this to be sure Spare Air is properly filled, is maintaingin pressure. Not imperative for actual emergency use (you have what you have on an emergency ascent and knowing doesn't change that), but it is sure nice to know you actually have 3000 psi when you start."
5,Splendid!,"I am absolutely thrilled with this CD. Mr. Nakai's ability to replicate the sounds of nature and animals (particulary the coyote) is remarkable. I light some incense, put on this CD and am instantly transported to a tranquil, uncluttered world. I highly recommend this to anyone who is into deep meditation or simple relaxation. His mastery of the flute and his feeling for the natural environment cannot be matched."
5,Too lovely and too mystical to describe!,I like the dubbing on the equipment where the flute re-echoes on sound waves. It feels as though flutes were singing through out the ancient Anasazi dwellings and the peoples were raising thier arms as if to touch mystical beings. This music puts me into almost a haunting state and imagination where ancient spirits seem to revive. This is very tranquil and too rich for even verbal poetry.
5,most spiritual loving intune artist ever in the world.,I play this mans tapes as often as posible and as soon as I can afford to purchase all of his newest ones I will> I have been putting my foster children to bed with his music. I have allowed my self time to heal with his music. I listen to the music of this gifted man as I put together my doeskin dresses and moccasins. I feel the precenses of the spiritual guides while producing a meaninful piece of clothes to a meaningful spiritual song of this wonderful and healing man and his music.
5,Musical peace....,"The pure tones of this native American flute are beautiful and calming, transporting me to a place of peace and well-being. In fact, I sometimes listen to it at bedtime as I fall asleep. It is elemental music at its best."
4,Great music to practice Tai Chi,Practicing Tai Chi is not hard but because the movements are so delivered I love to hear special music when I practice.The music of Carlos Nakia and his Canyon Trilogy is the perfect companion for any type of relaxation technique.
3,OK but I prefer Jeff Ball as a NAF player,"Carlos Nakai is an extraordinary individual. However, my favorite NAF CD's are, "" Wind Tamer"" by Jeff BAll, ""The Shape of Light"" by Jeff Ball and ""Thunder Chord"" by Coyote Oldman. All three very different CD's but all very uplifting. Also if you want to learn to play the NAF check out ""Trailhead of the American Indian Courting Flute w/CD"" by Jeff Ball and Bruce Whitten. GH"
2,It all sounds the same,I thought I would really like this CD and the other one I purchased by Carlos Nakai; but all the songs sound the same to me.
3,Canyon Trilogy,I found that the music was slightly depressing and significantly similar in sound so that towards the end of the CD I was just as happy to have it end.
2,Typical,"I have read the many praising reviews of this cd, but in the end I disagree with them. This album is not bad, and it is nice for what it is. However, it is your run of the mill Native American flute music that sounds like every other cd of its kind. If you love this kind of thing, and obviously many people do, then you will be in seventh heaven with this album. But for me, I could go to Wal-mart and pick up a cd that sounds just as good from their little Sounds Of Nature display."
1,"Incoherent, bogus mumbo jumbo of ""Taoism""","This Mr Ni puts himself out as the only chinese person who ""knows"". What a joke, If you would like to join a cult and have Mr Ni as your guru then I would recomend this trash."
5,Classic of classics,"This book, as with the rest of this series, contains many fundamental papers and articles. A valuable resource for any ecologist, conservation biologist, or palaeoecologist working in the tropics."
2,awkward fit,the shoulders are a really weird fit and it runs small...basically the only thing i liked about it is that it said marines on it lol oorah
2,Outdoor sensor faulty,"The indoor base unit performed very well, but the outdoor sensor I got was bad. I followed the initialization routine exactly as outlined and had the remote in the same room as the base unit. The base and remote started off reading similar temps, but over a 24 hour period the remote temp would drift as high as +75F and as low as -20F. With the remote still indoors, obviously something was wrong.I emailed La Crosse technical support (support@lacrossetechnology.com) and received a reply the next day that just outlined several steps for me to try that were already in their manual. They also offered to replace the unit, if I paid to have it shipped it to them. I chose to return the unit where I bought it for a refund.I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 for at least trying to make it right."
2,Doesn't live up to the name,"After receiving Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul, I read it cover to cover and thoroughly enjoyed it. Since then, I became a big Chicken Soup fan and bought a few other books. Among them I recommend (other than the above) Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul and the original Chicken Soup book. I feel bad not highly recommending this book either, but I felt utterly disappointed after purchasing this book and really wanted a refund, unfortunately I had spilled a drink on it. It seems as though the publishers were simply trying to push another Chicken Soup book and just slapped a book together using remnant, semi-motivating stories from the editing floor rejects and stories from celebrities that weren't necessarily as inspiring as I would expect. Perhaps if this was my first Chicken soup book, I would have loved it, but it wasn't and I was sorely displeased."
2,"eh, could be better","Not only did it take over 6 weeks to just get 1 magazine, i couldn't wait that long, i canceled my subscription before i got it.also, these mags are all about sex, expensive fashion, or weight loss.i would've gotten people but i didn't have $125 or so for a year."
1,Will it ever get here?,I purchased my subscription on 12/26/2007 it is NOW 2/9/2008 and have recived ONE magazine! Im pretty sure two have already came out by than... Still waiting to see if I will be getting a refund or a magazine. Price was GREAT dont get me wrong I just wish I would be able to see the final product
1,Mother of god.,"I got this magazine along with a few others for my GF.Its such a bad magazine... it really is... My GF didnt even like it.Its everything that's wrong in the world. It reinforces all the stereotypes that make women feel bad about themselves, make them vain, and insecure.Its full of ridiculous advice and terrible opinions.Don't bother."
2,1/4 of a year Renewal?!,"I have only received 3 magazines after placing my order for a 1-year renewal.. And my last mailing included notice that my subscription is expiring! For the $5 I payed, I realize I can't be too upset, I am however disappointed and am glad I did not send as a gift!"
1,Not worth more than $5,"The content in Cosmopolitan is almost identical from month to month, so I can't imagine why anyone would pay the full subscription price for this magazine. I subscribed to Cosmo for a year just to see how terrible their content really is, and I was not disappointed -- shallow, repetitive, and often strange sex advice that you could find online for free (and honestly, what you'd find online is probably more accurate and helpful!).If you're interested in having a good laugh with your friends while you read the absurd tips and tricks aloud, then it's definitely worth the $5."
1,Great magazine terrible service,"I love cosmo and got this subscription as a gift but I haven't received half of the issues. The subscription skips to every other month, I never get the magazine before it hits the newstands... and when I have complained and complained and complained they don't do anything. They have told me they would renew my subscription for the next year, didn't. said they would extend it an additional 3 months. didn't. It's beyond irritating, doesn't make any since. And defeats the purpose of having a subscription. I am such a big, avid customer of amazon and this is by far the worst service I have ever received from them."
3,Geared toward the under 30 crowd,"I expected Cosmopolitan to be similar to Glamour & Allure but it really is aimed for a very young audience. Many, many articles about sex, sex tips, hook-ups, etc. and all of the quoted participants are in their early 20's. There are a few good articles but little of relevance for anyone 40 or above. I will not renew this magazine."
2,Ok but trashy,I used to read Cosmo in college and when I saw a deal for a year for 5.00 how could I go wrong? Well I did. I found every issue to be very trashy and was shocked how sexual the entire thing is. Lots of model thin people all over it and no wonder we have body issues! I would pass on this unless you need sexual tips every month.
1,NOT Always late,I too subscribed to this magazine thinking I would get it before the news stands or at least at the same time. The lastest issue (April) has been on the stands for 3 days. When I went to the Cosmo site to see when they were planning to ship mine it said the week of April 3rd? Really?! That's a month late...I had to edit this because my April issue came yesterday after I wrote this. OOPS! Maybe it just takes a few months for them to catch up with new subscriptions. I will update this next month to let you know...10/5/2010 It's been a few months since I wrote this and it seems that Cosmo has no set delivery date! LOL But it's never been in my mailbox BEFORE I've seen it at some store. Sometimes it's the same day but usually at least 3 or 4 days after the grocery store puts it out.
3,Magazine,I have not read this publication in many years so I am defintely outdated for this magazine
5,Excellent Reading..,"I never have to worry about the same topics over and over again.I love Cosmo for that reason.As a woman, I like to keep up on things that matter and are on a girls mind, rather than BS that doesn't!"
5,My wife loved,"1 year subscription for a good price, worth it.I gave this gift for my wife and she really liked.I recommend"
5,Entertained,Love love love cosmo. They always have great articles and keep me waiting for next issue. Would but again and again.
4,Love this magazine,I wish there weren't so many ads. Other than that I love this mag. I am 27...I think I am part of the targeted audience.
4,Cheap and good!,GReat deal on this subscription and I've had no problems with having them delivered or getting the right issues.
1,Very long delivery time....,I ordered it back in the middle of July and I am not supposed to get the first magazine until September. I would have never gotten the subscription if I knew it would take that long. It would have been easier to just sign up for one with the magazine.....
2,AWFUL SERVICE!,"after receiving my issues things were fine, but i moved changed my address and wrote THREE TIMES that i was missing issues! no one ever replied.... horrible and i bought this magazine for years!!!!"
2,subscription not so great,I havent received my issues since January & they are already on newsstands & in supermarkets. Subscription would be better if I was to actually receive my magazines! Perhaps this is why it was so cheap
3,Good Cheap Trashy Magazine,I bought a one year subscription because it was only five dollars. My first magazine came really fast. I tend to look more at the beauty and health sections. The sex and relationship articles seem to be the same every month. I would never pay cover price for this magazine.
3,A good magazine for young females,"I booked this magazine because there is a promotion. I did not expect too much from it. As I got the first issue, I found the magazine is ""women"" focused instead of a fashion magazine that I want. However, my wife likes it. she said there are a few interesting stuffs for females."
2,Not as good as it used to be.,"I used to read this magazine religiously, stopped for a few years and tried to pick it back up again. Maybe I've gotten to old to read it, but it is not nearly as good as it used to be. I will not be renewing for next year."
2,Ehhh,"I used to be a big fan of cosomo, I don't if it's because I am older but it just seems like it's the same article over and over again. I probably won't subsrcibe for another year."
5,Gf loves it,My girlfriend loves this magazine. I like the auto renewal so that I don't have to worry about the subscription running out.
4,Good Deal,So much better than buying the issue monthly from a store. This is a great deal on a 1 year subscription.
4,more for younger people,"some good articles a lot of sex talk (it is COSMO) don't love it don't hate it I have read it off and on for many years.Enjoy Redbook,More and a few other"
1,....,I didn't see a mention of the price increase when I signed up for automatic renewal. Should have known that up front
2,Wrong address,"I ordered this magazine, and put in MY address. I had ordered cosmo-girl as a gift for my niece last year( which she didn't get all of them), and I have yet to recieve any magazines to my address. I just found out that they started going to my 15 year old niece. So I just tried to change the address, but it shouldn't have went there in the first place. I entered MY address. Just not really happy with Cosmo."
5,Love it!,I really enjoy Cosmo! They have some great advice and interesting stories. It is a great magazine.
5,My favorite magazine!,How can you go wrong with a years subscription to Cosmo for just barely over the cost of ONE issue? NO complaints here!
1,A waste of trees,"I'm embarrassed when it comes in my mailbox. Immediately it's dropped in the recycling. I got it free and regret the choice. Seeing all the five stars in this review is a sad comment on today's women. Brainless, unsexy sex, makeup, clothes. What a waste of talent."
1,never even came,I ordered this months ago and never received a thing ..... not the first time i've been screwed by amazon
1,Cosmo Subscription that never came,"I am completely fed up. I ordered my subscriptions in July! You I filed a claim before and then you asked for an apartment number. I gave it to you and still nothing. Maybe I am weird, but I usually like to actually receive what I pay for."
3,good price but problem,The first two magazines they sent me were ones i had purchased before I signed up for this subscription so that was a bummer
3,OK,"The magazine was good, if not a bit repetitive at times. But I never liked how I would receive it way after it was already in stores. With all my other subscriptions to magazines I would always get the magazine before it went out in stores."
5,Great deal! Great mag!,"Excellent mag with fun articles. Nothing too deep, great style tips, shopping tips and relationship advice for fun, fearless females!"
3,Hit or Miss,I feel like sometimes Cosmo tries too hard to be an over hyped 20 something magazine when it doesn't need to be. In my collection of magazines this is the one that I read for the somewhat helpful advice for 20 somethings. For example if they talk about women protecting themselves from predators or feature a story along the same lines. Mostly you flip through the endless amounts of ads and overly in your face sex tips. It just feels like they are trying too hard which is disappointing for a magazine that has the rep it has. If you want a quality magazine to read cover to cover this one would be pretty low on my list. There are some good aspects but the bad bring it down so much from the quality that loyal readers were used to.
2,Bleh...definitely a magazine for single 20-somethings...,"You definitely need to be single and in your 20's to appreciate this mag. I am 32 and married, so I find it annoying how every other page is talking about how to land a man, keep a man, please a man, etc. - pleeaaasssee. I hope young women that read these don't think that their entire lives should revolve around men. I love my husband dearly, but I feel it is a bit insulting they way the mag spends about 80% of it talking about what we can do to please them. I got this magazine on an amazing deal, thank goodness, because I would NEVER pay full price for this rag.If you are a single 20-something that wants dating advice, then this mag is for you. If you are a married 20-something, then I would look elsewhere."
1,Nothing special,"I used to purchase this magazine fairly often though I have never subscribed to it for one reason - every issue is the same!! Buy one copy of this magazine and that's plenty. Save your money on this one and buy Glamour or Self instead. Personally, I think Glamour is the best magazine I've subscribed to. It has the best balance in content."
3,a little dissappointed,"I was pleased to get some issues of this magazine soon after ordering. That being said, I was terribly dissappointed to have several of those issues arrive 2 months late, or specifically, to get the july at the end of June, then receive the june issue july 7th. So I got an issue that I obviously didnt need, and that will be docked from my 24 months.Other than that, its the same magazine. which is good"
1,"cheap, tacky, mostly talks of bedtime secrets... less rounded","I subscribed to this magazine for beauty tips, make up, fashion and general girl health etc... this one turned out to be a bedtime guide... paper quality is low. Pictures pixelise... last three pages are classfieds for adult entertainment and toys !!??? content is very shallow and headline oriented. U'd read the entire magazine and realize that one of the headlines on the cover was the entire story. there was nothing more to it...I was expecting more of a class magazine than a bedtime tricks guide. Very disappointed..."
3,Cutting Corners Causing A Decline in Total Quality,"This was my ""first"" grown-up girl magazine and I still share a fondness for it and usually buy it at least three or four times a year. My guess is in order to keep the cover price down, the mag is trying to cut corners on other importent areas like--paper quality. The magazine is printed on a lower quality paper than most--decreasing its' durability and readability. Also, let's face it--some of the writing is just not up to the same level of many competing magazines. The articles seem repetitive, simple-minded and without a lot of useful information. Let's hope the ""old gal"" gets a quality ""face-lift"" and soon."
1,Gets delivered AFTER it hits shelves..,"My girlfriend loves Cosmopolitan, so as a present I bought her a subscription to the magazine. The magazine itself is good and entertaining, but I'm very disappointed by the fact that both times I ordered it (once from Amazon, once direct from their website) it arrived via mail up to a couple of weeks after it had already hit grocery store shelves. I would expect that if you order a subscription you'd be able to get the magazine before, or at least at the same time that it hits store shelves. Like I said, my girlfriend loves reading Cosmo, but I just can't recommend a magazine which might arrive so late regularly for you, as it does for me."
1,Takes too long for each monthly issue to arrive,"This is a ridiculous ""bargain."" They compensate for the discount by making the subscriber wait weeks after each monthly issue hits the stands. As I recall, being a subscriber entitled one to either receive mags slightly earlier than when they hit the stands or - at the every least - the same time they hit the stands. I do not plan on renewing."
1,"The same thing, sex and diets","Every month its the same thing, how to have sex and how to loose weight. Its so repetitive its stupid. Cosmo is just bad, the cover ""models"" are bad, the articles are horrendous. I used to be a faithful buyer till i realized that each month its the same stuff. The same sex tips, the same smokey eyes, the same sexy beach waves for hair, and the same cheap paper its printed on."
3,Nothing new...,"This magazine hasn't changed and therefore, everything being covered in this issue for example has been mentioned and covered more than 10 different times. Although, it's still a good magazine to read over for the sake of entertaining yourself and you can probably even get a laugh at some of the ridiculous articles."
1,Boring,This is a crappy magazine.All it has is articles on sex and and how to attract men.IT is not a good read for the intellectual woman.
1,Never on time!!,My rating is not based on the actual magazine or the quality of the magazine. It is only on shipping. I have to send an email out every month to remind them to send me my copy. Customer service is horrible.
1,Never received,"I paid for the subscription in september, it's now January and I still have not received an issue. Has any one else experienced this? My subscription does not show up in the Cosmo account either."
1,Thumbs down...,Never ordered this product yet somehow my account was charged....not happy and cannot find a way to get ahold of anyone!!
1,The magazine the hardly came,I bought this offer last year - I got the first 3 issues and then it stopped coming - same with vanity fair.I tried complaining I would have been happy with just extending subscription for missed issues. No response Until Oh yes it is renewal time I got one magazine with resubscribe nowand then one saying it was my final issueSo for $5 I got 5 issues and never saw the other 7The ONly magazines that came through were O - time - mac iLife and Leisure
3,Okay,Don't want auto- renewal. Just the one year. If you can correct this. It would be perfect. Please I will be moving within year and not sure of addres so do not want auto renew. And if I get charged more than 5 .00 for renewal I will be really upset. Was not aware when I purchased it was auto renewal
5,Cheapest subscription to the coolest magazine available,"My wife loves Cosmo but they're like $3.50 per issue from the store, plus you might miss one. With this she gets 12 magazines for $5 and they simply show up in the mail. Great deal. A great gift."
1,Not to thrilled,Less then one star. I still have not received this order yet. It shows that it was shipped out on the 9th ... Of least month.
1,Where are my magazines?,I have not received any copies of the magazine yet... They are all out in stores. What's going on? Womp..
5,A good way to relax...,When I saw a super good deal to subscribe to Cosmo I had to jump on it and treat myself.I love relaxing with Cosmo after a long day!
5,Cosmo..gotta have it!,"Always refreshing to read the newest information on health, wealth, beauty & life stories that anyone can relate to. I look forward to receiving my monthly issue in the mail :)"
1,"Buyer Beware, Terrible service","I can't tell my story on here as it won't let me but Long story short, I didn't get the product I paid for and the customer service was absolute rubbish."
3,Not a lot to read...,"I got a subscription to this magazine when amazon was running a deal so it was really cheap. For the price I paid I really can't complain all that much. I've never had a subscription to cosomo but would pick up an issue here and there. I feel like the substance of this magazine has really gone down over the years. There is a lot of advertising and not a whole lot to read, and what is there to read isn't all that interesting. The magazine is really geared to young, single women. Overall it was still a good value and will give you something to do (for a short time) but I wouldn't recommend ordering unless you get it at a great price!"
1,Cosmo,"Placed order 4 months ago and have only recieved 2 issues. The first was not even a real Cosmo, so I guess I should say I have only recieved 1 issue. Dont Waste your Money!"
1,Don't waste your time...,"In the past, Cosmo was a mindless fun read / a guilty pleasure...I hadn't picked up this mag for years and when I saw it for a good price, I thought, why not? Well, I'll tell you why not...it's complete trash...and had no redeeming qualities about it...all it promotes is for women to become ditzy skanks whose only purpose in life is to please men. If you've read one issue, you've read them all."
1,Aamonzon over charge you so much,"The magazine is great, but you can buy it cheaper at many place. Just go to any of your local book store, fine the magazine there is always insert there and you pay $12/year or $20/2 years to get the subscription. Only fool wll buy it from Amazon."
1,Never received an issue,Ordered through Amazon in April and still have not received a copy. Called the customer service a few times but still have not received a single issue. Wouldn't want to order magazines through Amazon again.
1,cancel my order do it now,every thing is fine but who cares 16words? please cancel my order how about please cancel mY order cancel my order i made the 16 word DO YOU GET IT
1,Did not order Cosmo,Was horrified to find this trashy mag in my mailbox. The maillady now thinks I read Cosmo. Ugh. Don't know where 2 yr sub. came from but I won't be paying for it.
1,did not want to renew,"I bought this magazine as a gift for my daughter last year. The magazine content was disappointing-I had not planned on renewing but, was unable to cancel the auto-renew in time. will be sure to cancel in time when subscription is up!"
1,I can't really give feedback,I love this magazine and thought it was a great deal for the year subscription! I will write a new review whenever I actually receive my order. Thank you
5,Very Pleased,Thank You Amazon.com for letting me purchase Cosmopolitan Magazine for 1 year for just $5.00!!! I got my magazine very quickly after I made the purchase on-line. This is a great magazine for Women and Men are interested in it also. So this magazine will be passed around to other people throughout this subscription. And of course I have told several people about Amazon!! Thank you.
2,So glad my subscription is over,"Maybe some people love Cosmopolitan, I was tired of it. I've purchased the magazine on the stands before, but never had a subscription. The first few months were ok, after that it seemed like ever issue was like the last. I won't be renewing my subscription this year."
1,A waste of money,"I ordered them for my wife since I thought that Cosmopolitan would be interesting but I was wrong. She was very disappointed. Plenty of ads, lack of good/interesting articles. Repetition of the same things. Will not recommend"
1,Never received,"I ordered this magazine on January 23, 2011. As of May 2, 2011, I have yet to receive my first issue. Very disappointed."
1,never order from them again,"never received my first order after two months waiting, after complaint with them three time, get a feedback that my home address is wrong. I've ordered more than 100 items from amazon and never had this problem. Then I cancelled my order, and only get 25% of the money back."
2,for younger women,"I like fashion and beauty magazines since it's a light and easy read. And I used to like this magazine. When I was younger. However, I am 30 now and whenever I pick up a copy...I feel stupider after I read it. Soooo much sex and stupid ""love"" advice. Things they say men want which often they don't, or things you should do to ""get them"". I am past the days where I want to try swinging from a chandelier, past the days where I want to play games with the guys I meet, and past the days of trying to be something I'm not. Be warned, this does not seem like a ""be yourself"" magazine. It seems like the ""be the woman you think he wants you to be"" magazine.However, I like the fashion and beauty sections and luckily know myself well enough to separate the useful from the BS in this magazine."
1,"If you're over 30, this is not the magazine for you!","Purchased this magazine because I was buying a different magazine for a gift, and this was cheap. Apparently, I am no longer a member of the Cosmo audience. As a married, 34-year old mother of 2, articles about wild and crazy sex in his office with his secretary watching and my bra as handcuffs...no longer appeal to me. I guess its my fault for purchasing and forgetting that my sex life consists of quickies on the couch trying to ignore the dog, who is watching! Almost the entire magazine revolves around sex. Along with trying to hide the sex articles from my daughter's view, I also have to watch the half naked men sprawled throughout the magazine. I know that may not be a negative to some subscribers! In addition, there is not really enough beauty and fashion articles. Apparently, I'm just out of touch. Regardless if you are over 30, don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Might be decent. . . . . IF they ever sent you an issue they charged you for.,"Magazine is a mix of topics from sex, women's health, and beauty. Do like that it has more articles that ads.However, despite multiple emails to the company with dismissive replies due to an error regarding how my address is printed on the magazine I rarely ever actually receive my subscription.Will not be renewing subscription."
4,purchased as a present,"purchased as a present for xmas... as long as the first magazine gets delivered, and there are no problems, then i definately recommend this... :-) who doesnt love cosmo for light reading? of course, you have to take all the info in the magazine with a grain of salt, and not completely live by all the advice, but i like it for light reading."
4,Love this magazine!,"I love this magazine and it is at a great price! This is my second year with buying this magazine online and everytime I come home from school it is waiting for me and I always share it with my best friend. Each magazine is around $4.29 or so. So, this is a great bargain! Love love love it! I wish I would have known about this deal sooner!"
3,"Great Magazine, Not Always On Time","I love, love, love this magazine. It's a fun magazine. The only complaint I have...is I see it in stores before my mailbox often."
2,Not worth it,"This magazine isn't worth the money. I felt like I was reading the same stuff all the time. Got bored real quick with this magazine & was very disappointed. After a few issues I could care less about it arriving & even then it was late compared to the stores already having it out. Maybe younger, single ladies might enjoy this but for me it was such a waste of money."
5,Great Deal,This deal for the magazine was too good to pass up. I'm an avid Cosmo reader and it makes me happy to know that I only paid for the price of about 3 magazines for a whole year's worth of magazines. Thank you for the great deal! :)
2,Boooring..zzz,"I am only repeating what other reviewers have said: Once you've read one issue of Cosmo, you've read them all.There are waay too many tips on sex, which state a little less than the obvious, i.e. to get him excited, wear lingerie! I'm sure I can get better sex tips from my grandma.You want substance with less sex? Subscribe to Glamour or Marie ClaireHigh Fashion? Elle or Vogue"
5,idk its for my girlfriend,ya so this is for my girlfriend so ya don't know what to say about it. the only thing that sucks is i ordered it at the end of September and i think she has to wait for the November issue.
1,NEVER GOT SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!,I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS MAGAZINE IN THE MAIL! I PLACED THE ORDER IN JANUARY AND IT IS NOW MAY! IT HAS BEEN 5 MONTHS AND NO MAGAZINE! I WANT A REFUND!!
2,magazine,"I ordered this magazine 11/28/09 and still have not received the magazine. what is the problem, do i need to cut down the trees myself????????????????"
5,Love it!!,"I love this magazine...it has everything that I'm into: The styles, the looks, the makeup, the celebs and more.. Great magazine..it's worth the money!!"
2,Useless cussing in titles,"I used to buy Cosmo many years ago and found the articles fun and informative. So maybe now it's an age issue. But some of the titles in the articles contained useless cussing. Maybe trying to appeal to the younger audience? But, ""Working Her Ass Off"" was a big turn off. I will not be renewing this magazine."
1,"Over a month later, still no magazine!","My money was taken right away, but it has been over a month and I still haven't recieved a single magazine. Dissappointed!"
4,Great Magazine,"I've been reading Cosmo since I was a young teen. It's full of great fashion & life tips. So when I saw it on Amazon at the price of $5 for a full year, I couldn't pass it up. They told me that I'd receive the first issue within 6-8 weeks, but it was more like 3. If you're a woman looking for a good magazine to read, I'd definitely suggest this."
5,Always great,Cosmo magazines are always great...very informative on all kinds of topics :)i think i will be renewing this subscription for a lifetime!!
5,LOVE Cosmo!,"I have been reading Cosmo for decades, probably before I should have been. Every young adult should have a script to read this great magazine. Full of real life articles and blurbs. I always pass my copies onto my bestie. My favorite time to read is by the pool drinking a Strawberry Daiquiri on vac. Def worth every penny!"
3,Renewed the subscription,I renewed my subscription after a year because I do enjoy this magazine. I find however that it's very repetitive. Most of the stories are reminiscent of ones in previous editions.
3,this was gift,i bought this for a gift and the person was really happy. no complaints. good way to save some money too
3,Better,"Better than I expected, but not really sure it's worth more than the $5 introductory rate I paid to get the subscription."
3,too old for cosmo,"I'm officially too old for cosmo... although it's a great magazine, the bf stories and work stories just don't relate to my life... although - love the style ;)"
3,havent recieved it so far..,"cosmopolitan is one of my favorite magazines, and i was thrilled when amazon had a promotion for 1 year for $5. i purchased it around the end of January, but I haven't received and issues yet. Other magazines that I have ordered from amazon have come fairly quickly so I am surprised its taking so long for this one. Hopefully I will get the March issue, and will get it for a fill 12 months from first issue date. otherwise, no complaints."
3,No tech support from La Crosse,"I liked this product the moment from I received it except that the remote sensor was not working. I tried to reinstalled it once or twice more based on the instruction but it still gave me no reading. I wrote an email to La Crosse Technical Suppor(suppor@lacrossetechnology.com) for help. No Answer. I wrote again. Still, no answer. I feel sorry that I had to return this product without giving it a second chance. But I had lost my confidence in this company after 10 days of waiting. :("
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I don't know who the people are on this interview, even though they are labeled as ""entertainer"". The Narrator sounds like he is reading a book report that half of it is filler. The few times we see Katy Perry speaking was taken from random TV interviews or was taken from vlogs. Somebody was looking to make a quick buck with a DVD with Katy Perry on the cover."
3,"Boring talk on Katy,, even though the talk was Positive","I was hoping there would be more on Katy Perry instead of two or three people talking about her that I didn't even know. That is not my idea of a good DVD. I love to watch Katy, but they had very little of Katy in the DVD."
1,Not Gluten Free,"I purchased this product to help heal my stomach after being diagnosed with Celiac. I had great luck with Nature's Way slippery elm. It was amazing. After going through the first bottle, I tried the Solaray brand because it was a little bit cheaper. It didn't help at all and it immediately made me feel bad. I contacted to company by email to see if they are gluten free and they said they couldn't answer that in writing. No company has ever had an issue with that before. I called the number provided just to have the guy quickly tell me that it's not gluten free. The bottle says no additional ingredients are in the product other than those listed, but that is not true. So if you are gluten intolerant and are trying to heal, do not use this brand. I recommend Nature's Way."
4,Quality item,"This CD Spinner was definitely not top notch, but for $25 dollars, it was definitely worth it. Mine had one small scratch on the top, but that was the only thing I found wrong with it. The spinner on the bottom worked well, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a CD spinner at a cheaper price."
2,Nothing new and bad photos,"I agree with the above review; minimal information, absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying. Meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books.He missed a few key chairs of note; Saarinen's Grasshopper chair and Aalto's Armchair 400 (Zebra or tank) chair.If you want a good welll rounded selection of Modern Chairs, I'd suggest the 1000 Chairs book instead."
5,RHINO gets it right this time!!!,"Sometimes, rhino doesn't go all out and give us the full versions of classic dance tracks, but with this series, they give it all, with great sound quality. Volume 5 is one of the strongest, with the best song selection. Track times for this volume:1. you dropped a bomb on me (13:15)2. groove line (7:29)3. got to be real (5:11)4. best of my love (3:42)5. be thankful (3:54)6. disco nights (rock freak) (7:59)7. do it any way you wanna (3:19)8. white horse (5:49)9. joystick (5:24)10. get off (5:46)"
2,Not Much Help,"I found that the information in this book on the background of literary authors was very limited. Besides, many of the best known and valued authors, such as James Joyce, were not included!!! I can find better and more complete information on the lives and works of important authors around the world in Google!!!"
5,"R. Carlos Nakai, always soothing","I have never met a cd by this artist that has not caused me to stop for a moment and gather my thoughts and get back in focus. This music for me is the most stress relieving on earth. If you have not tried it, I would recommend this one."
3,Extensive,"This was my first choice when I started searching for books on horse stable design, I must say that it took me some months before I made the investment and bought the book. I was a bit disappointed when I finally received it, but then again maybe I was looking for an easy way out by looking for straight forward answers to my indecisions. The book is a scientific look into stable and arena design (facts with little emotion), everything is laid down before you all the possibilities but there is no suggestion on what might be a wiser solution. The arena design could be more extensive we all know that it needs a subbase, base and footing ... but what can help in getting it right...Maybe I expected too muchThis book's biggest set back is the price (for me anyway)"
1,These filmmakers are the true evil,"My name is Caeser Pink. The makers of this video are guilty of illigal use of of video footage owned by my band, which is featured on the DVD.The makers of this video believe that all people who belong to any other religion are evil satan worshippers. I believe religious intolerance is an evil force in the world and is responsibe for terrorists acts such as 9/11. We need to teach people to respect each others beliefs system if the world is ever to live in peace.People who promote the philosophy that Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Wiccans, and followers of other religions are satanic are the true evil in our society. But rejoice, because my lawyers will soon have this DVD off the market."
4,Size runs *very* large...,"I first ordered a size 10, which was correct for my thumb according to the ring size charts available on Amazon. It was WAY too large. I then ordered a size 9 and it was still too large. I would recommend at least 2 full sizes lower than Amazon suggests.Otherwise, the ring is not ""fine jewelry"", but it has a fun, comfortable shape and is a little more interesting than a plain band. The quality is good, but silver is soft and so it bends easily. I would buy it again (in the right size)."
1,Really awful stuff!,This product goes on like old white out - big flakes with thin translucent runny liquid in between. Applicator is far too bulky for a decent line even if the product wasn't better suited for an office supply bottom drawer.
4,Great Price and Color,"I like the applicator, like the way I can perfectly line my eyes. Love the colors, too. The gold color and the plum color both make green eyes stand out. The only problem is that it doesn't last all day."
1,White water,This so called eyeliner is so diluted with water it slips off like your putting milk on your skin. I'll never buy it again.
3,"Simmering 1st half, lame 2nd half.","First of all, the Rhino CD re-issue I have contains(thankfully) the original version of 'Runaway'. Secondly, the first (or what was side 1 on the LP) half of the album is fantastic. But unfortunately, the post-disco/synth/early new wave flavor of the early '80's, really dooms the second half the CD. The only exception is the closing song- which aptly describes the sister's career after this album."
5,definitely worthwhile,"I think I heard the same things as the previous reviewer, but... Yes, Gatti is keen on bringingout the numerous details Mahler specifies in this score, almost to the extent of fastidiousness,but it is all to the good effect, as the symphony here sounds so richly expressive andquite individualistic, which fits Mahler to a T to many people including me. The recordedsound is not, as said by some, ""ludicrous"" (as exaggerated?) but truly dynamic andclear to hear. Not the best recording ever of this piece (what is?) but definitelyworth a try, and I am sure I will listen to it again from time to time."
3,wind speed indicator short commings,This Weather station is less then adequate. The temp and humidity work ok but the wind speed sensor is a piece of junk. I would suggest a station that uses the spinning cup sensor. One little piece of spider web caught up in the blades of this one puts it out of service. Also their technical support is poor to say the least.
1,Waste of Your Money,"This product came with a com port hook (pin plug in) up. Most modern day computers all have USB hook up, so it won't work with my computer because you can't plung it in. I had the system working for two days and it just quit. I mean it just stopped functioning (wind and temperature only). I changed locations (didn't work) , I changed batteries (didn't work), I hooked up to electric (didn't work). When I say it didn't work I mean the wind and temerature gauges just stopped and won't work (no inside reading on the main unit). I placed the main unit 10 feet away thru a glass window (still didn't work). The odd part is it worked for one and a half days and then just started malfunctioning. I reset and reset and did ever thing possible to insure it was not me or the operational procedure. I will say delivery was quick in just five days from WI to SC. Taking my money was quick. The process was easy, however I recommend you don't waste your money or your time on this item!"
3,Only once in a while,This product is ok but nothing you would want on a regular basis. I ordered this product thinking I could have it for lunch but one lunch was enough!
3,Not very good.,"Got a few of these for quick work lunches. I don't think they are very flavorful, though they are easy. I'd rather have a little flavor. I actually prefer the ramen noodles & the various asian noodle bowels to these."
4,An approach to self-soothing and meditation,"Mind Your Heart is a concise, clear description of an approach to healing. I found it annoying that other researchers were not given credit."
4,Great switch,It is the easiest to use 4-port KVM I have found.The older version uses standard cables and comes with all the cables.The newer version comes with proprietary cables so it is a small db connector on one end and vga/kbd/mouse on the other for the computer ports.I have both and like the old one better in case a cable fails or I need to re-deploy the parts for a project.
5,Black & White Photography 2nd Edition,"This book has alot of great information in it. This book is great for beginning and even advance photographiers in that there is so much infomation. Also is a great reference guide if you were to forget some techinque or what filter to use. I really enjoyed this book, learned some new things. I feel that every photographier should have this book."
5,Shelley is a genius...,"Although better known for his poetry, Percy Shelley is a thought provoking author of prose, as well. The book contains over 35 essays reflecting Shelley's views on such topics as religion, life, capital punishment,love, and freedom. His views on God and religion are particularly astute and would interest anyone who has wrestled with his/her own faith."
3,Great book for someone trying to build a dirt cheap buggy.,"This book is perfect for someone that wants to build a buggy and spend the least amount of cash possible. It covers most all the basics.If you are planning on building a full on sand/race machine, you may just want this as a hand reference. The case buggy they build is designed for street use and some mild offroading, not exactly what serious offroaders are looking for. The book is based more around building a buggy for price rather than performance.If you are wanting to upgrade you machine to a true racer, this is not the book. While the section on engines is good, there not a section covering increasing suspension travel or upgrading a transmission. He mentions the different types of frames, but doesn't cover the + and - of each. If anyone knows of a book that covers these topics, please email me: realparadigm@hotmail.com"
3,Good but lacking information,"As the title says ""build an dune buggy"" are lacking the words ""without build the chassis"". This book describes theprocess on building an dune buggy only conecting the parts.There are lacking details about build the chassis.Overall this is a good book. The chapter about the engineis very good and teaches you how to overhaul the VW air-cooledengine. There is a good section about brakes. As a referencebook I recommend but this book isn't it for build an dunebuggy from scratch."
4,"Competent, fairly thorough.","Overall, it is a good book. It reads easily, ample pictures to illustrate points to those who may not be too familiar with this hobby. It's focus is more towards building a buggy from a kit, or at least, buying a commercial frame and customizing the rest to your needs. Those who are looking for principles behind the design of custom built buggies will not find a whole lot of help. General information and suggestions might be pulled from its pages, but a reference for custom builds it isn't.A few minor layout and editing goofs were the only thing that mars an otherwise good book. A few paragraphs had lost their ends and there was one major skip that i feel should have definately been caught by the proofers."
1,Far too basic to warrant a whole book!,"Baja Bugs and buggies is the bible of building a dune buggy.This book is less use than the haynes manual.There is no detail or any usefull tips unless you count pictures showing which way round the gearbox is installed.It does however show that it is possible to build a dune buggy with all stock VW parts and no welding ability, although it is the ugliest dune buggy I have ever seen."
3,Great for the beginner dune buggy enthusiast.,"This book covers the buildup of a dunebuggy from frame selection to final assembly in considerable detail. For the novice, it is a great help. For people more experienced, the information is probably a repeat of past experiences.There are a few details which I do not agree with in the author's choice of assembly but this is a personal opinion and does not necessarily mean that either of us are wrong.As a companion to the Idiot's Guide to VWs and Hibbards' Baja Bug book, this volume would be very useful to many a buggy builder."
5,Dirt Bugs,"Got this book for my brother in-law, he's thinking about building a ""dirt bug"" not many dunes in southwest Texas; so it's a bit of a stretch calling it a dune buggy."
3,Not bad.,This book does not do a very good job at explaining the details of building a dune buggy. It is basically a guy who goes thru him building the buggy in the picture. It is things like (the gear shifter goes between the 2 front seats). He does not go into much detail than that. Nothing about weld it in and make sure you have room for this or that and make sure you do not weld it in so low that it blocks the rod coming out the back. Very basic stuff I thought I already knew when I bought the book. There are other books out there that are a lot better.
4,Uplifting,"A beautiful rendition of human nature. Several people, with diverse personalities and circumstances are stranded at a train station. Though circumstances are strained, and tempers flare, they realize the miracles in their lives and find the true meaning of Christmas by sharing what they have and spreading love."
3,"Debbie Macomber, Storyteller","As in all Macomber's books, the story is good this one is not as developed as some, thus the three star stamp."
4,Great featherbed,Never had one before this one and I did some research. This one is doing a great job of keeping me comfy at night after a few months. No feathers leaking out or any other problems.
4,Jolson Sings Again - just sit back and enjoy!,"Jolson Sings Again is the excellent sequal of The Jolson Story. Viewers really need to see The Jolson Story first, then Jolson Sings again. These two productions provide a wonderful overview of the exceptional career of Al Jolson. Great music and acting; well directed. Those who have seen these movies remain amazed that Larry Parks does such a wonderful job ""lip sinking"" to actual recordings by the infamous Al Jolson. Sit back and enjoy the wonderful story and great old songs."
3,Less Dramatic Sequel,"This is the second part of the story of Al Jolson. Although it does not go so far as to encompass the time where the last movie left off to his death because he was still living when it was made, it is interesting to see a less well-known piece. The movie begins right where it left off and covers Jolson beginning his career again, retiring again, entertaining troops in WWII, meeting a new wife, and being immortalized on the silver screen. This is certainly a more depressing film than the first and also less action packed.Larry Parks does a wonderful job at playing Jolson once again. His participation in the movie is kind of spoofed when Parks as Jolson meets himself as a new actor chosen to play the part of the world's greatest entertainer. Perhaps his best scenes are during the emotional screening of The Jolson Story.Unfortunately, it seems that the music isn't relied on as heavily in this film and many of the songs played are Jolson's less popular ones."
4,"Super film, old times, best times","This is a very nice classic film, Larry Parks sets a perfect preformance off Al Jolson."
3,A fairly enjoyable sequel to a great original.,"Like most sequels, this sequel to THE JOLSON STORY is inferior to the original. Movies about true events which occurred only a few years earlier tend to be awkward, and the scenes involving the making of THE JOLSON STORY, showing Larry Parks portraying both himself and Al Jolson, are just a bit silly. But the film is quite enjoyable and gives several more opportunities to hear the voice of ""the world's greatest entertainer"" again."
2,Don't get this dvd.,"Go for the book. The material in this dvd is very short. There are only 8 examples and you have to print the booklet of tablature. It's not a good buy, I tried to request a refund because on the back it says ""booklet included"" and it wasn't realizing later that on the disc it says you have to print the booklet. Looks and sounds very cheaply made and seems thrown together after the book was put out."
3,Mastercool 91046-A Air Conditioner System Flush Kit,"Worked good after I was able to modify the rubber nozzle.Nozzle was too small and wouldn't seal the injection point properly.I wish it came with both the nozzle it has, and a larger one if needed.Then I would give it 5 stars."
1,junk,"This was a very disappointing product. Worked great on day 1, but the next day the trigger failed completely. I had to take apart the trigger and make it permanently ""on"". I control it now with the air supply. A decent idea, but lousy quality control in manufacturing drops it to a single star."
2,Projection works only in complete darkness,"The clock is simple and works fine. It is not fancy or good-looking. The outdoor temperature and clock are synchronized automatically by the outdoor unit. The only problem is the projection, it is not possible to see the projection unless it is 100% dark, even if there is very little light in the room (e.g. even right after sun rise) you cannot see the ""projected"" time."
3,did i miss something?,"i bought the key chain for a friend because it got such good reviews. when i got it, it was nothing special. The shipping cost more than the key chain and it was shipped in a little envelope. I could have easily have gotten something about the same at the advance auto store. I'm going to be a little ashamed giving it as a christmas gift. It was nice, but the total cost was 16.00 and i don't think it was worth it."
2,2nd best Pixma printer,"This one was ranked 7th overall in a recent Consumer Reports issue(may '05 pg.28) and scored only ""fair"" in graphics quality. It's lower priced cousin, the Pixma iP4000, was ranked #2, overall score in the excellent range and designated as a ""CR best buy"". The 5000 actually tested slower than the 4000 in both text speed(ppm) and 4x6 time. Admittedly, the superior 9600x2400 res. is impressive as is the 1pl droplet size. The 5 color ink tanks are a bit misleading as 2 of them are black. Canon printers are the best so don't waste money on HP,Epson, & Lexmark.To the reviewer below that stated that everybody uses 20 lb. paper, I use a ""bright white"" 24 lb. inkjet paper for everyday use (20 is too thin- better for fax & copy machines). Also, the reviewer incorrectly states the 5000 does not use the two black inks, in fact it uses the same ink tanks with 2 blacks(BCI-3eBK/6BK), just like the 4000."
1,Doesn't Last,"I bought this based upon the reviews here last year. So much for community info. It has already started ""banding"" in less than a year. A new print head is about $125. It clogs very often, possibly because I use cheap ink from ""Printpal."" Maybe it would do better with Canon ink, but I never tried it. The separate color cartridges are a plus. This is the first time I tried Canon. I'm going to go back to HP and try a Laser printer to replace this useless piece of $#^*."
2,"Great Print, Poor Quality","Purchased in November 2005 which makes it less than 16 months old. Was getting orange error code lite that blinked 14 times, not even in the book. Emailed customer service and they were real nice and provided wrong solution via email but were good enough to provide me with a toll free number that costs 9.95 per chat. On to the internet where I found that the orange lite that blinks 14 times says a problem with paper feed cam sensor. Wrote back to customer service asking if a little compressed air would help and they said try it. They also said they would let me purchase another one at discounted price, big of them. Had always had good luck with Epson, think I'll pass on their offer and get another Epson. Good luck."
2,"great start, dissappointing finish","Loved the print quality, speed, cost per page.Now my second one has failed with the same problem as the first (both lasted less than a year).Photos all look green, tried replacing all the ink cartridges. If you're like me and don't have the time or patience to mess around with warranties etc. you may want to look elsewhere."
1,Over Rated and out dated,Very disapoointed in the information found in this book- Out dated... very early 90's style information. Good for a brand new manager... but anyone with any experience will be extreemly disapointed.
5,Very Tasty,"I like Pop-Tarts, as does my family, and I was thrilled to see Go-Tarts and even more thrilled when we tasted them. You do not need to put these little guys in the toaster; they are ready to dance about in your mouth without any heating and this is a good feature. I often look for little snacks that I can take with me on long or short trips. Sometimes a nibble keeps mouths occupied and stress down just when you need a little quiet in the car; these are great for that or any other time you want a quick snack. I tasted the Frosted Strawberry and it is very good. Give them a try, great for a quick snack at home or on the go."
1,Go Tarts,"I searched every store in this area for the GoTarts before deciding to purchase them online. I was pleased with the timeliness and free shipping I received. I, however, was very dissatisfied when I opened the case of GoTarts only to realize that they had an expiration date within 30 days of my receiving them. I hope they last past that due date as my family will not be able to consume them all prior to the expiration date. I will not be ordering food from this site again in fear of this happening again."
4,It Works,This will work as long as you purchase an extension pole which will vary in additional cost. I think it works best for smaller homes.
5,Absolutely one of my all time favorite series.,"It is delightful and worthy of watching over and over and over and over. The filming is gorgeous, the characters memorable and the stories funny and human. If you love the Irish and Ireland, don't miss this one. I await the release of the second series with bated breath."
3,very funny historical series,"Sometimes this comedy is really too full of itself?I laughed well at some of the droll situations.The picture of the Irish gentleman as a huntingfool who drank and traded horses has just a little of an English taint to it.All the regular Irish here are shown as a servant classto the English and Irish gentry.The picture is somewhat like sayingall American Indians are drunks who live on the reservation,it lacks any fairness as a true historical picture.One of the reasons northern Ireland has had revolt for solong is this sort of characterization?The actual Irish are their own people who deeply resentedthe colonial British presence of Judges and troops.The resulting comedy appears more like cartoonsthan actually characterizations?"
2,Irish R.M.,Was thoroughly disappointed in this collection. I expected it to be on the same level as other British series. It was not.
2,Terrible product,"This was edible and did not make me vomit or anything so I can give it 2 stars. It says to put Hot (Not boiling) water in and let it sit for a couple minutes. I did this and the rice never absorbed all the water, so it was a bit crunchy and kind of gross, plus since the rice didn't absorb all the water it was more like a soup or a stew."
1,It is what it is......,"GAH! This stuff is terrible. You get what you pay for - cheap, boxed, microwaveable rice....and it tastes just like cheap, boxed rice that has been cooked in the microwave."
2,Meh,"These were inexpensive and delivered promptly. Don't buy 'em, though, unless you know for a fact you already like this brand/flavor. No amount of seasoning, butter, or even intoxicants are likely to make these edible."
5,"hard to pick a favorite, but this one is it!","It's really hard to pick a favorite Zappa album, but this is probably it. If I had to make a list of 5-10 albums that are representative of Zappa at his best, this would be in it for sure.If you're not familiar with Zappa's late '60's stuff, this will not be an easy listen in the begining. It's very avant-guarde and jumps abruptly from one style to another (which I love!, but this may be Zappa at his creative peak. This one that may take several listenings to fully appreciate. I can tell you that I have owned this album for more than 20 years and I still hear new things!The CD has added tracks from the Uncle Meat movie (which I haven't seen) which are total garbage. First time listeners should listen to the album as originally released - go from ""Cruising for Burgers"" to ""King Kong"". Without these perhaps it could have been squeezed onto one CD. Never mind that - the original music is worth the relatively high price.BUY THIS CD NOW!!!"
5,Great film music!,"This is one of Zappa's more inaccessable albums and you probably shouldn't listen to it unless you are already a fan. It contains a lot of improvisation by Zappa and band members but also some ""composed"" pieces which demostrate Zappa's talent as a composer.Its got comedy in it (of course!) but instrumentals dominate the album. I should add though that even the instrumentals seem to be quite humerous. There is around 30 minutes of speech from the movie, which is also entertaining, but you probably won't find yourself listenign to those tracks so often.As usual Zappa uses many different styles including rock, jazz, doo-wop, classical and others. Great album when you're in the mood for something wierd and a little darker in tone than most of Zappa's output.e"
2,Zappa loses his audience on this one,"I was a Zappa fan until he started in on his jazz flavored musical albums. He lost me on this one. Zappa seemed to have become obsessed with jamming rather than writing music. Many of the albums which follow this one seem to be nothing but recorded jams that seem to go on forever. Sales plummeted, fans defected, I held onto my wallet and stopped buying Zappa albums. The music became complex for its own sake-and less enjoyable.Some people loved this Zappa material, it is true, but that group became smaller and smaller. In retrospect, few critics (or fans) count Zappa's work after his first 3-4 albums as among his best."
3,Would be great as a single-disc album,"There's some wonderful stuff here, most notably ""King Kong,"" but unfortunately half the album is filler. Best left to the hardcore Zapa fans (like me)."
2,Beware archaic English,"Stephen Greenblatt's extraordinary book ""The Swerve"" no doubt made readers curious about Lucretius and his poem. I bought this translation without being diligent. It is rife with archaic English verb forms. It was easy to find out William Ellery Leonard's translation dates from early twentieth century. I had expected a free verse translation in modern English. Translation is not recommended."
2,"On the Nature of Things, translated by Walter Englert","The Martin Ferguson Smith translation of this work, published by Hackett Publishing Company, is far superior to this--and any other--translation."
5,Great translation,This book is easy to comprehend and very interesting. I recommend this book for leisure reading also.
1,NO BOOk! TABLE OF CONTENTS ONLY!,This kindle book was free but there was no book. Second page turn jumps to 60% complete and then ends about 10 pages later. Nothing but a table of contents and a bunch of chapter headers with no content at all.
4,Cute piece for rememberance,This is a very cute piece! Baby was happy watching the clown spin. Nice that you can use it every year with the numbers that change!
5,Nicely made music box. Will make a nice keepsake,Bought this for my granddaughters first birthday. Very well made and should last a long time for her. Love the numbers that can be changed for each of her future birthdays and she'll really like the little clown that spins around as the music plays.Safely packed for shipping and received in a prompt manner.
1,Disappointed - not sure if it's counterfeit - very weak.Learned Issey is the most counterfeited men's product.,Not sure that it isn't counterfeit as it is very weak. I know b'cause I've used the product over 18years. Just learned that Issey is the most counterfeited mens product.
5,The basket I was looking for!,"I was looking for an attractive, black wire basket that blended with my office decor, looked modern and wasn't big and boxy and I found this little gem. And the price was better than the local store."
4,It's a basket.,"This is a metal basket. It is black. and it works...as a basket. If you need this basket to be something else, buy something else."
1,"Looks great, doesn't last","We bought this product as part of a full set of Danze Sonora fixtures for a bathroom. The other fixtures all look and work great, this one only lasted a year before the lever that switches the water from tub to shower broke off. Now we have to replace this one, and it won't be with the same model."
5,Fantastic!!,"I live in a small studio apartment with my boyfriend, a dog, and two cats. I could not stand the smell of the kitty litter and its accompanying excrement. I decided to give the fresh and clean pet deodorizing solid a chance and voila!! No more cat smell, no more perfum-ey scents trying to camouflage the smell. Just a no scent environment, and happy cats. My boyfriend joked that we should buy a case next time and I think we just might! So if you are sensitive to scents, or just don't like excess perfumes floating around your house yet you don't want your house to smell like kitty litter, seriously give this stuff a try!!"
4,A twilight view of Trieste,"Morris' perspective on Trieste is unique on several counts: a seasoned and sensitive traveler, she has a deep affection for a city that doesn't rank high on most people's lists of favorite places; she's experienced the city as both a young man and a middle-aged woman; and she's well-read about the city's history and literary associations, but she uses her learning as the backdrop for direct experience of life in Trieste, rather than as an end in itself. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, both as an appreciative visitor's impressions of the city and as an account of Morris' elegiac musings late in an eventful life. On the other hand, having recently read Claudio Magris' ""Microcosms,"" I was forcibly reminded that this book is Trieste from an outsider's perspective. It's a beautiful book and well worth reading, but, for the Triestine mind in action, read Magris."
1,Very low level,"Don't waste your time reading this book.About 10% of this book is information worth knowing. The rest is ""packaging material"" ( How the books is organized?, What are we going to do next? and countless repetitions )."
3,Good Book for a Beginner,"I bought this book and I thought it was a good resource to start developing JSP based Servlet based web applications.I would recommend this book as a starter for anyone making the initial transition to Java Web Development. There are many books on the shelf, not as many as in years before, and in truth most of them are not worth the paper they are written on. But these books are normally published by the same company. Addison Wesley usually publishes good quality material.Good book for the right audience."
2,Disappointment,"I came across this book after reading articles written by the authors on sites devoted to Java development.The short articles written by the authors were insightful and thorough.My expectations for the book were high but the end results are far below the standards I was expecting. It appears that the authors (or editors) were lost as to the focus of the book. The writing style is tedious to follow. The order of the book is haphazard.The book starts off at getting a Hello World application up and running - for Servlets. The following chapter is a similar introduction to JSP.The authors seem preoccupied with Internalization - this appears all over the book.Subsequent chapters cover exception handling, security, JSP tags etc.You may find nuggets of useful references in this book - sparsely located but they do exist. Hence the two stars - but it still does not justify the sticker price."

Hence the two stars - but it still does not justify the sticker price."
2,Not enough info,"I read and really like Trottier's SCREENWRITING BIBLE. I also like the column he does in Script Magazine: ""Dr. Format."" That's why I was dissapointed when I read this book. It seems to be just a cut and paste from his magazine articles. A lot of the information is even redundant, having appeared in more than one article. The advice is sound -- you just don't need to be beat over the head with it.All of the information in this book is in the SCREENWRITING BIBLE. Save yourself some money and just buy one book."
3,A MESS BUT WELL-WORTH THE READ,"For a book about formatting, this book itself has a terrible format. Instead of grouping ideas together, it just presents the articles from the author's column in a seemingly random order. It is well-indexed. But all that page turning shouldn't be necessary. It seems not even to have been properly edited/printed - a couple of the pages in the middle are out of order. A more important problem is that a couple of the examples of formatting contain typos or contradict other examples. All of this being said, it still has a wealth of information and is well-worth the read."
5,"Solid, heavy & seem to work just fine","I was a bit worried from the one negative review on ordering these candles. I purchased 8 for the holiday season a few weeks ago. All 8 work just fine with AAA rechargeable Eveready or Duracell alkaline.In addition, the base is heavy giving the candle a sturdy feel. None of the cats have managed to knock one of these off the window sill (yet).We also like the ability to select either white light or the flickering yellow. Lets one change their appearance based on mood and location.These are higher priced but so far seem to be worth the money."
3,The candles work fine,"Nice effect with no wires. They were nice in the window for Christmas and now I like them on the mantel. A month later they're still burning on the same batteries, although I don't use them everyday."
1,Alas too good to be true!,"The candle and base are nice and sturdy, unfortunately the bulb is not bright.Batteries are expensive as each candle takes 3 ""C"" batteries.The bulbs have not lasted a month before they are too dim to be seen.An expensive buy all around."
5,Great product,This is just what I wanted. You can use it for bread dough or for cookie dough. It doesn't move. It was shipped very quickly too. Item was as described. I am thinking of getting another for our RV as a work station too.
2,Disappointed - be careful how you roll it up to store,"If you purchase this product you will probably love it but put a layer of paper or cloth on it before rolling it up to store.I purchased this product because my plastic one slides all over the counter. Using the product itself is great however after being stored rolled up for a long period of time the black border (my border is colored black) stuck to the other areas it touched while rolled up. So now in the middle of the rolling area I have a long black streak of silicone clumps stuck to it and I cannot get it off. I am afraid to use again for fear some pieces of the silicone will break off into the dough. So I have no choice but to throw it away. Thinking about getting another one and then put something on top of it before rolling it like wax paper or a cloth. (And yes, I rolled it up correctly - textured side out according to the instructions.)"
4,Silpat work space,This provides a nice and clean workspace and allows for easier rolling of different types of doughs. It also ships quickly.
3,"Great on some dough, not so great on others.","Works pretty well on ""dry"" dough like breads and cinnamon rolls. Moister doughs like pastry still require some flour. Cleans up very easily and doesn't slide around at all unless the counter underneath is wet.Would have given it four stars if it was about 30% cheaper. If it truly was nonstick with every dough I would have given it five stars even at the current price."
2,"Doesn't slip, but dough still sticks.","The maker of this pastry mat claims that one can now roll out pie crust on this may without using flour. Well, I tried that and it doesn't work - the crust sticks, so I have to use flour with it. However, the mat ""sticks"" to the counter which is very nice. When I have used a pastry cloth it always slides around so it's difficult to roll out the dough. Overall, I don't think it's worth the money."
2,Nice large size!,This is a nice size for rolling out pastry. It would be better if circles & measurements were printed on it for pie crusts. Make sure you don't use a knife because it can be cut & ruined easily.
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this product in the hopes that it would make for easier holiday cookie baking. I tried using this mat with flour and without, to no avail. The cookie dough clung to the mat tenaciously. After adding copious amounts of flour, I was finally able to lift whole cookie. The only positive thing I can say is that it did adhere to the table well."
4,Silpat mat,I am excited to use the silpat counter mat. If it is anything like the silpat baking mats I am sure it will be wonderful.
4,"Nothing fancy, a good flute album, worth owning","For your money you get 15 selections of flute music, nothing synthesized or electronic, not complicated stuff.I'm not sure how authentic a ""sound"" you're getting here, the notes indicate that many of the selections are original Nakai compositions, but it all sounds good.Nothing fancy and generally not fast paced, most of the selections are under 3 minutes in length, just pure flute music the way I want it."
4,"Changing ""Changes""","I got the CD to replace a tape I purchased on my first trip out to Santa Fe, New Mexico in the mid-eighties. It was my introduction to Nakai's beautiful Native American flute music and I have loved it and used it in my classes teaching people how to pinch clay forms ever since.I love the music and hope the CD holds up as long as the tape did."
4,Loved it,This CD brings the same peace and tranquility that I have come to know from Mr Nakai's music.
4,Another 'Zodiac' and a great introduction to it!,"This is a 'pocket' type of book, full of color, information, and touched with history. It is very direct, to the point, touching on every aspect of Earth Medicine as it deals with the Totem of the Crow. I am sure his other books are similarly arranged: I'm going to buy them! (Or, at the very least, grab the Totems of my elemental clan (Deer and Otter) and my affinity Totem (Falcon). A great read, and another way of looking at ourselves!"
2,bad design,"1- Pig tail antenna wire is 30"" long and has to be plugged into headphone jack to have FM or TV reception though speaker. No reception except AM without wire. How would like a 30"" wire sticking out of your cell phone or PDA wifi? Looks bad.2- Bottom of radio case is not perfectly flat so it just barely stands up with speaker facing you. Sangeon could have made a more flat bottom to case.3- There are two timers. A short count down and an alarm at some predetermined time. Neither alarm will either shut off sound from radio or turn sound on at a set time. So it can't be used as an radio on alarm travel or fall asleep to music. I don't understand below comment about person falling asleep to radio and having it shut off.4- If Amazon allows me to return it I will."
1,Doesn't work well inside,"I bought this radio after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I bought it to use while working out indoors (for all of you women who use it outside: every women's magazine will tell you not to wear headphones outside), and the reception was really poor. Very loud hissing noises. Couldn't get any television stations. Further note: this was my second radio. The first arrived defective (although Amazon handled the return very nicely and promptly)."
1,Pocket Radio,"Bought this radio to use in a high rise office building. Radio' AM tuner unable to receive signal through the building walls / structure. Works great, if outdoors!"
4,Good radio,"I've had this radio for 8 years now and still going strong. The weather band has always been poor in my area (which is why only 4 stars), but other than that no complaints. Oh, and obviously the TV function is no longer usefull, but I didn't get it for that. This is a small radio that does a good job pulling in stations."
5,fantastic,Received it yesterday- was better than expected- great. My husband liked it so well I gave it to him for an early Christmas gift. It has everything and more in a tiny package. Does everything but cook dinner.
3,Great Radio---terrible on/off switch,"I use portable radios for backpacking. On the really good side, this radio gets reception better than any other I have owned or tried.BIG negative? The on/off switch. If you breathe on it, it activates the radio. What were they thinking? A portable radio that will turn on with the least movement. Why couldn't they have done it right with a conventional on/off switch? I hate this button, it sometimes renders it useless to use when the radio is in transit, as it will turn on (or off) with the least urging. argh!"
1,Probably the biggest rip-off ever,"I would say that the reception of this radio is close to null. I work in Manhattan and can barely receive reception from the most powerful stations. Also, there is no fine tuning so I almost always get overlapping stations, one minute rock n roll the next Spanish salsa! As far as TV goes - FORGET IT - simply awful. Do not buy this product..."
1,Needs Ear Piece To Get FM?,"I didn't buy the Grundig / Porsche radio because these reviews seemed better. This radio is tiny and though it has a speaker you need the ear piece to get an FM signal - it stinks basically. My girlfriend and I bought them for our Dads, but couldn't get to work. Wasted $ on gift wrap & 2 day air. -Dan"
2,Not So Incredible Reception,"I replaced my existing Sony with this based on the reviews here of 'Incredible Reception'. The Sangean performed not one bit better than my Sony at twice the price. If weather stations are important to you and you have TV stations in the Ch2 to Ch13 range that you *have* to hear, then this is a good buy. Otherwise, make sure you deeply desire an overpriced radio."
3,Broken after 6 uses,"Radio is wonderful; small, decent reception, but it flat out broke after about six uses. Had to pay 15 bucks to send for fixing, Sangean did send me a new one, but not worth the trouble. The reception is decent, but not worth 70 bucks"
5,I compared this to my CC Radio,"Let's cut to the chase, I compared this to my CC Radio. An A B comparison..If the CC radio was a 10 in picking up am.. The 300 was a 9.4 on FM it was also a 9.4 On the weather band it picked up the same weather channels my cc radio did and on the same channels and what really suprised me was the 300 picked up one more TV station than the cc radio did. I live in the country and the closest TV station is 80 miles away as the crow flies..The ear buds are a joke but a better pair of head sets will sound really good on FM stereo with plenty of bass. I like this radio.. I was suprised how small and lite it is..It picks up way better than my Sony walkman.."
3,Good Radio,"I bought one of these radios about 7 or 8 years ago primarily to use while traveling and at the ball park. It proved to be a good radio for traveling and an adequate radio for use at the ball park. In the ball park reception was bad in certain areas and in other areas the radio had to be turned to tune in the station. Since I live in an area by the sea, the battery terminals get corroded faster than normal and apparently something inside got corroded as well since operation now unreliable.The compact size is great. The auto-off timer is rather annoying since the factory setting can not be changed and to make it through a ball game, the radio must be turned back on a couple of times. I found the supplied ear buds to be uncomfortable but used them anyway --- the jack is smaller than normal.BOTTOM LINE: The radio worked good enough that I am now ordering another one from Amazon at a savings of more than $20 when compared to what I paid for the orginal one."
2,good but......,"this little radio has great reception, pulling in distant stations clearly and producing good sound with deep bass. unfortunately after about 6 months of intermittent use the headphone socket became loose and the plug would move and the signal went out to one of the earbuds. i tried to contact the company but got no reply. no service at all. no answer to emails or phonecalls!! too bad."
1,Where's the great reception?,"Contrary to what others report, the FM reception on my unit is dreadful. I have a couple of cheap FM radios that receive local stations clearly, stations that don't even register on the Sangean. I'm very disappointed."
1,"Eats up batteries, stopped working after a couple weeks","I bought this radio thinking I would appreciate the extra bands (weather, tv) and that I would get great fm and am reception. Those things were nice, but this radio ate up batteries very quickly. I had to change batteries every week or so. On my old analog pocket radio (which I use a lot) batteries last at least a couple months.After a few weeks of use the whole thing kind of crapped out on me. While I was listening to it, it sort of crackled, and then some new station came on. From that point on, every single setting brought in this new station. Weird. I sent it back.Also, the speaker is too quiet to be of any real use. I've had other mini radios, and this has the worst built in speaker I have heard."
1,Not satisfied at all.,Buying a portable radio with a digital tuner sounded like a good idea to me when I bought the Sangean DT-300-VW. I was ready to enjoy some steady reception for my walks around the neighborhood. What I got was a Tic Tac box painted silver with the word 'radio' written in crayon. What a [bad deal].
4,I like it,"The book was a required reading for a class.It's content was a little outdated, but thebook showed up in a mannerly fashion,and was listed as ""used"" so, I really didn'texpect more than what I got, or paid.Thank you,Becky S."
4,Great book at a great price!,This book gives very good insight into the predictable stages of human life. It helps you understand what you might be going through and you might find that you are very much of the norm.
1,Hack across the board,"Only an entrenched and embittered ""feminist/ageist/deluded windbag could take this claptrap seriously. Amen. Pass the crack pipe, please. This the woo woo solipsistic rhetoric that may one day die out, be taken off life support."
2,a disappointing contribution to life-stage theory,"Sheehy offers an interesting categorization of life stages in the context of American life as she has known it and lived it. She uses excerpts from the hundreds of interviews she conducted throughout the United States while preparing this book to prove her theory. Her stages have catchy labels: Tryout Twenties, Turbulent Thirties, Flourishing Forties, Flaming Fifties, Serene Sixties. Sheehy's attempt to make meaning of the mature years is most likely to become an artifact of its era, unable to cross cultures or time. Her passages depend too heavily on life as it is being lived in the 1990s in the United States of America. With the work of Erikson and Jung on developmental aging already on the book shelf and thoughtful contributions by such as Friedan, Schacter-Shalomi and Miller, and others, Sheehy's contribution is disappointing."
2,Mapping this book against time,"Conceptually excellent, but a dismally dreary read.Ever been at a cocktail party where you meet someone who tells an interesting story, but takes half an hour to do it, because of all the needless peripheral information. Sheehy personified. She fails to hold my attention with tediously drawn-out examples which lack pith and focus. An good editor would halve the length and double the value. The content is not bad, it just takes so damn long to get to the point.Very Ameri-centric."
5,New Passages Really Helped,"I found Sheehy's second ""Passages"" book almost as good as the first. As an aging baby boomer, the issues of recharting my life direction at middle age has been daunting to say the least. Second Passages provided the structure for this process. I also suggest ""The Second Journey"" by T. Athey as another good book - more focus on the issues of the Baby Boomer generation.Platonix"
2,She keeps going and going and going....,Gail Sheehy provides a new perspective on aging...yet she repeats the same points continuously throughout the book. You get the main idea of her whole book in the prologue and learn nothing more after. If you are under 40 this will bore and depress you like nothing else.
2,sweet but predictable,this is an earlier book and it is a romance novel not up to her current caliber. good read for the beach|
4,Prime Time,"Prime Time was very interesting, and intriging. I like the characters in it, and I liked how the main character Andy handled the rough rugged Lyon and handled the interview with Lyon's father. She was firm but gentle and the father was honest and told her what she wanted to know. This was a fun book to read.I bought the book from Amazon"
5,Prime Time - Sandra Brown,Same thing I've said on the last 20 reviews: Everything was in good shape and on time! Consider every shipment is fine and I will let you know if they're not!
4,MACHO MAN,"It seems like I always have a better opinion of the hero. I think Lyon was completely justified in being upset at Andi's response to Les. They had just spent the night together and she goes running down the stairs into Les's arms--after assuring Lyon that they were JUST friends. Maybe he went a little overboard after his father's death, but I liked him. He's a man's man and capable of a great deal of tenderness. I don't think he's a bad choice and I believe his suspicians are DONE.Since this was written early in Sandra Brown's career, it wasn't developed as well but it had the same ability to hold your interest waiting to see what happens on the next page. I agree with another reviewer--Joyce Bean is excellent. She makes the story come alive."
2,Prime Time,"Assured she will be granted a network position, Andrea Malone is determined to get the coveted interview with a retired General. Her only problem is that she has to get by his son, Lyon Ratiff first.Andrea and Lyon irritate and annoy each other from first sight, but are undeniably drawn to each other.I can tell this is an early work for SB. The characters are not as well developed, and a lot of attention to detail is missed."
1,Worst Sandra Brown I have read yet.,"I'm wondering how Brown has the ability to write great novels such as WHITE HOT or SUNNY CHANDLER'S RETURN and then waste her time and efforts on PRIME TIME which was so lame. Not one aspect of Prime Time was developed. The characters lacked depth, the plot itself was thin and boring, and the dialogue was cliche and predictable.I wouldn't even recommend this book to die-hard Brown fans."
2,Prime Time Should Air Late At Night!,"PRIME TIME was originally published under the pseudonym of Rachel Ryan.This is a story about a TV reporter, Andrea Malone who wants a network job. She's sure an interview with a retired US General in Texas will get that job for her if she can reveal his reason for the self-imposed seclusion. The only thing she has trouble with is his son, Lyon Ratiff. The anger, suspicion and uneasiness leads to love. Wow, does anything not lead to love with Sandra Brown?PRIME TIME has a good story line, but nothing surprising in the plot line. The characters are strong but not as developed as they could be. If more depth were given to the characters, it may have led to a few twists and turns that were unexpected and would keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat!. Don't change your schedule to fit this book in, just use it to stop gaps in your schedule and you'll be happy!"
2,PRIME TIME,Love making over and over. Boring and repiititous. PRIME TIME is no time. More than half way through it and nothing happens.
2,Read this review before buying,"I purchased this controller to use with my Streetglow ANSV2 white strobes. The controller is very small, includes 5 wire leads with plugs that make installation easy. This controller does exactly what it says and will flash your strobes in several different patterns. Unfortunately many of the flash patterns are so fast that the strobes do not have enough time to recharge between flashes and they do not fire in the correct sequence. There is no speed adjustment so when used with Streetglow's strobes this controller receives a FAIL. If you were to use this controller with LED based strobes it would work correctly. Very dissapointed that Streetglow sells this product with such an obvious issue when using their strobes."
5,Good Buy,I already knew that I liked this CD since I've already owned one but it turned up missing. It's great to put on and drift off to sleep with. I was a little leary about buying a used CD but I am happy to say that the CD arrived in excellant condition. Thanks.
4,Does Kindle destroy copy editing?,"My first Maugham book and I loved the story and the writing style. It is a little dated but it retains great power. HOWEVER this Vintage copy on Kindle was full of typographical errors. It appears that the process is something like a scan to pdf followed by a completely inadequate proof reading (or none). There were spelling errors like ""arragned"" and ""bf"" instead of ""of"". There were full stops in the middle of sentences. I was not sure if I was reading slightly archaic English and punctuation or an electronic botch. At this rate, the authenticity of lierature is not safe in electronic form. Shame!"
1,Burned Again,"Too bad the seller shipped the wrong item. I ordered the ""cylindrical"" shaped Proxabrush, not the ""tapered"" shaped. For a $12 purchase, it's futile for me to complain. I just won't order again thru Amazon. Burned again.In fact, the picture below shows exactly what I ordered. Too bad I didn't receive what I ordered."
2,Krown Flame,Okay for an entry level board. The bushings that came with the original trucks were so hard that a 190lb. adult had trouble turning the board. I purchased softer bushings ($8.00) for my 40 lb. son and the board turned much easier. The board was shipped to me missing a part for one of the trucks. I have not heard back from the seller so I stole the part from an older board (bummer if you don't have one).
3,Not as good as the others...,This is not one of Julia's better ones. Hyacinth's ability to translate from Italian to English was to be basic and should have had some translation errors in it. I would love to have her ability as she seemed to have no trouble in the translation at all!
3,Was ok,"The book was ok, I have keep up to day with all the Bridgerton children and can not wait for Gregory's book. Then the grandchildren's stories will hopefully follow.Hyacinth I thought would be more intresting though. The book bounced around a bit and left you hanging at the end. Wasn't one of my Favorite Bridgeton family books. But you will like it just the same.Didn't mention any of the other family member as much as I would have suspected. Anthony of course since he is head of the family, but no sister-in laws or brother inlaws had any parts.My favorte one is Lady Danbury, who had a larger part in this book then the previous and still as cranky as ever! Gotto love her!is a good book, just don't buy it expecting too much an dyou will be happy!"
2,Boring,"With each book I get a bit more disappointed. The first couple in this series -- esp. Viscount Who Loved Me -- were really spectacular. But, I guess that since we keep buying the books no matter how lousy they get, Ms. Quinn doesn't have to bother working as hard as she initially did to write a good story. This one is pretty weak. At least this was readable, something I can't say about Eloise's story or even Francesca's."
1,normally a fan,"This book and the next one - On the Way to the Wedding - show a dimunition of the JQ brand. They're just not up to her usual excellent standard. I think the mantle has been passed. If you read Anne Gracie's Perfect Rake which is ... perfect or Guilty Pleasures by Laura Lee Guhrke you will see what I mean. Come on Julia, your fans need you to get your previous act together."
2,Very disappointing,"I found the ending involving specifically Isabella's decision to be a tremendous letdown for the entire story. Truly blew off the main characters and their story. JMO, too bad."
2,"Coming from ""When he was wicked"".........................",Coming off her Bridgerton series this is definately not what I expected.
4,Good Reading,The ending could have been better but this was still a good read. Gregory came across like a typical big brother. He was annoying to his sister and funny at the same time. I can't wait to read his story.This book was missing the Briderton Family involvement. I guess it would be difficult to include them all with the same finesse the other books had since the majority are married now.The end gave me the impression that Ms Quinn will be writing about the Bridgerton Grandkids soon.
5,Its In His Kiss,"Ms Quinn has done it again,A great read for fans of romance.It was wonderful from page one to the last page and is one of Ms Quinns best.What a wonderfully quirky Heroine and equally dashing Hero,It was a fun,witty read and I'm looking forward to Gregorys story.If you love a great romance and enjoy a good laugh as well,you will love this.It stays true to the Bridgerton stories."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I bought this book at Walden Books it was reduced to $5.99 with 50% off of that price. Now I know why it was so cheap, its just that bad. The characters are weak, the hero trys to be strong but is a wimp. The strongest character is his grandmother. The romance scenes are terrible, I actually finished this in a couple hours, because I skipped ahead in the hopes that it would get better, no such luck. Don't waste your money and this author sucks."
2,Disappointed...Just OK,"I am most definitely a Julia Quinn fan. I love her Bridgerton series. But Hyacinth's story was boring....and the ending unbelievably disappointing. NOT a ""must read""."
3,Thoved this thook,"I cracked up when Hyacinth's brother was teasing her about how there children would grow up, using ""th"" in front of all their words because Hyacinth and Gareth both have ""th"" in their names. I loved the scene when Gareth meets her family. Other than that the book was just ordinary. However it was a nice sit under the pine trees and read. Thanks the Summer Reader."
4,Not quite as strong as hoped...,"This book is fast, fun, and written in Ms. Quinn's usual impeccable style. But the relationship felt forced and the plot contrived. Both Gareth and Hyacinth impulsively go for a kiss and have ""aha"" moments where they realize their deep, previously hidden love and passion for each other. In Romancing Mister Bridgerton, Colin has a similar sort of realization, and as I read through that passage, I completely bought his unexpected emotional upheaval. Gareth and Hyacinth's fall into love was far less believable. On top of this, the jewel plot was a bit silly.Still, a mediocre book by Julia Quinn is an excellent book. Gareth and Hyacinth were both solid characters with consistent personalities. After the awkward realization of love, the two of them mesh quite nicely as a couple. All of the secondary characters were strong as well, although this book feels a little empty when I consider how few of the Bridgerton clan actually walk through these pages."
2,slightly boring,I found myself skipping pages and not even missing anything. Unimportant conversations went on and on. Didn't like the ending at all.
4,Very funny and sweet,This book was very entertaining. I liked watching Hyacinth and Gareth slowly falling for each other. It's definitely a keeper!
2,Not Julia Quinn-esq,"I am a huge fan of Julia Quinn, but I cannot give this book more than a two star.The witless Banter between Hyacinth's and St Clair alone was shoved on me page after page after page after....did I say page after page.....plus these dialogues had absolutely nothing to do with the story.I found myself wondering if something more interesting might happen and that is why I finished the book....the optimist that I am.The only thing in my opinion that seemed to make thinly keep my interest is figuring out who was St Clair's biological father, after that I was ready to put the book down.I cannot believe this is the same author of the preceding books, (The duke and I, The Viscount who Loved me, An offer from a gentleman)I'm so disappointed in this storyline....This writing, storyline over all plot was immature and juvenileIf you don't think this review is helpful and you absolutely need to read this book then that is fine, just don't spend more than a penny on a used copy."
4,Very Enjoyable Read!,"I read this book after having decided to take a break from romances for awhile. ""It's In His Kiss"" was a very satisfying return to the historical romance genre for me. I had been a tad bit disappointed with a few of the previous books in the Bridgerton series but this one delivered. I thoroughly enjoyed the witty interaction between Hyacinth and Gareth - and Lady Danbury...what a hoot! Many laugh-out-loud moments combined with some quite touching scenes make for a very enjoyable read.I look forward to reading Gregory's story in the future."
4,Romance,Typical romance but well written and keeps you turning the pages. Perfect type to read to take your mind off life.
4,Loved this story!,I really like Hyacinth and Gareth - they were a great match and I enjoyed the banter and storyline. One of my favorites in the Bridgerton series.
2,Disappointing!,I love Julia Quinn but this book was so dull that I actually quit reading it in the middle. I usually rush out and buy her books the day they come out but I think I'll wait a little longer next time. She seems to try a little too hard to make Hyacinth witty. Gareth is a dud as well.
2,It's in His Kiss,"I like smart, outspoken heroines, but Hyacinth got on my nerves. There is a time to be smart and outspoken but not when it makes everyone around you look idiotic and that is what the author seemed to do here. No-one seemed to be able to match wits with Hyacinth and I didn't want to read about her showing off her intelligence all the time. The twist at the end where she gets her come-uppence by her own daughter is cute."
3,Entertaining Enough....,"I rate this novel relatively high in the Bridgerton Series. It was a simple romance about the last of the Bridgerton girls to get married off. Hyacinth is a refreshing character b/c she's full of personality and has an unquenchable thirst for adventure. Luckily, an adventure lands right in her lap when she decides to translate Gareth St. Clair's grandmother's diary. The diary leads them on a treasure hunt and along the way a romance blossoms.I thoroughly enjoyed this book b/c the romance was believable, the characters were honest with one another and there was an actual story beside the betrothal. I loved Anthony Bridgerton's reaction when Gareth St. Clair asked for permission to marry Hyacinth! :) It's not a 4 or 5 star novel, but definitely an enjoyable read."
4,Lovely,Eeeeeh!!D: I wish it continued ><Splendid book :)Yet another job well done by Julia Quinn. A joy to read :]
3,Mixed feelings on this one...,"I tried real hard not to compare ""It's In His Kiss"" to ""When He Was Wicked"" because there has never been another novel (in my opinion) to compare with that one. But this one stood on its own and kept me entertained throughout. ""It's In His Kiss"" is a romantic and comical read, and definitely worth the time and money."
4,"Fun, but not fantastic.","Number 7 in the Bridgerton series was a little disappointing but still a fun read. Julia Quin stayed true to character for Hyacinth Bridgerton, but Garreth lost a little of his edge as they were getting closer acquainted and the continual search for the bracelet was a little hokey, compared to the other books in the series. All in all still 4 stars (3 1/2), because you just can't go wrong with the Bridgertons."
3,"Cute, sweet and silly...but not romantic.","I am a big fan of Ms Quinn. However I found the entire series of the Bridgerton's to be sadly lacking.As with all the other books from the series, the characters, the romance and the chemistry leaves a lot to be desired.""Splendid"" ""How to marry a Marquis"" and ""Dancing at Midnight"" were all much better written. And ohhh sooo romantic. I miss books like that and hope she goes back to tht style."
3,I've had better!!!,"okay but could have used a bit more info on her dad, it took too long to find out, and they never really had a relationship that would garner any real affection for their characters. Good but not great."
4,A good book.,"I really don't know why anyone would call any of Julia Quinn's books 'just ok'. They are all so much better than that. I didn't find any major flaws with the characters or the story that I just couldn't get over. I found myself laughing out loud frequently and looking like a complete fool, just like I do whenever I read a JQ book. I actually liked Hyacinth and Gareth. Gregory's story should be even better."
4,ok fit,the k&n instructions were ok. I thought the fit could have been better. You can sure here the difference in noise level.
3,"Excellent photos, difficult reading","Although the photos of beads are excellent, I found this book far too much like a PhD dissertation, with the feel of a synthesis, having substance but written in a format which was difficult to read. Bibliographic references imbedded in the text just add to the unreadable style. The text is painfully lacking in the kind of information I appreciate, such as dating, geography, and clear references to the individual beads presented in the photos. And references to values of beads in dollars has no relevant meaning unless there is a time reference. As a reference book I would rate it of minimal worth. As a coffee table amusement it is acceptable, but would need far more photos to make it useful for that purpose."
3,Collecting old beads,"This book has a lot of great photos and general information. However, in trying to date old trade beads it is often lacking dates and is unclear to the novice on how to recognize fake vs real. It's still a nice book to have."
3,Doesn't really rock,"This album looks appetizing at a first look but may leave you disappointed. But I'll admit that some of the songs are actually really good!* Sinister Footwear (Great performance of a beautiful instrumental that has since then become a Zappa classic)* Truck Driver Divorce (Funny play with time signatures, but FZ's lead vocals are far too loud in the mix. The solo part is kind of psychedelic, almost hysteric, but I like it)But there are several tunes that aren't very good at all. What ever happened to the fury that is present on the Sheik Yerbouti album for instance? I wish that drummer Wackerman would give the drums a wild bash. He plays perfect but lacks the rock energy here. This is probably one of FZ's better albums of the mid 80's. Still only 3 stars out of 5. That says a lot about that era."
4,Not the best,"This album isnt one of my favorite Zappa releases, not even close. But even still it is well worth checking out. Some good songs."
5,An excellent addition to my library,"The terminology in this industry seems endless. So it's great to have something for reference when unfamiliar terms or phrases are brought into conversation. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to gain familiarity with the buzzwords of the industry. It seems like a perfect tool for college graduates who don't want to be caught off guard in a job interview. And it also is great for someone like me, who's been in the business for a while. Easy read.Sincerely,Rick HowardInformation Technology DirectorWhiting Distribution Systems, Inc."
4,Really works,"This stuff actually does what it says it will. My wife got some to help her with her nervousness for a speech class she was taking, and I decided to try it.It really does make you feel very calm, but also has caffeine, so it's an alert calm. Great for people that have stress at work or are just anxious.My only complaint is that if you take it everyday, it doesn't have the same large effect, so it's best to just take it a few hours before you need it."
1,Could cause a pretty crappy allergic reaction,"For me it was a short bout of itchy eyes and an extremely runny nose( I have also taken them on more than one occasion, with the same results every time) when I first started to take them I would just blame the weather, but after taking too many in too many different occasions I figured it was probably just a slight allergic reaction.It could have worked if whatever was in it that gave me the sniffles and itchy eyes so bad was not in it.If you have never tried it before I would suggest starting with a small package first.I am not sure how bad this reaction could get, or if other people are more sensitive.I would actually advise anyone to speak to there healthcare provider about this one, especially if you haveever had an allergic reaction to antibiotics, pollen, or pet dander."
1,Causes occasional light DEATH.,"I ordered this product because I was curious as to its efficacy. On further investigation, it turns out that kava kava and more specifically Happy Camper have been linked to liver failure and, in some instances, death. Personally I am not interested in something that may either make me a little happier for a day, or kill me for the rest of my life. I have nothing against this company or this type of product- just do a little research before you try it. BE CAREFUL."
2,No Difference,"I did not notice almost any difference after taking this pill. Since this is my first time taking it, I will wait and see if things change. But for now, no change in my mood... =|"
2,Felt absolutely nothing!,"I am a SUPER healthy eater, so maybe that's why. Perhaps this will work for people that eat a lot of junk. For me though; BIG waste of money! I give it 2 stars bc it must be good for something..."
1,Could kill you!,I have been taking this product and it seemed to help a little but not as much as taking 5HTP. Then I noticed it said something about causing a rare liver condition. So I researched it more as you should and one woman died after she needed a liver transplant from the effects of kava (main ingredient in this product) and several other people needed liver transplants after taking this product.
3,"Seem to help a bit, dose may be deficient","Been taking these for a few days and they do seem to help a bit. However, the prime mover in the ingredient list is Kava root, that's the thing that's most likely to produced marked results, and I have to wonder if there's enough of that in the standard dose to make a difference. I'm going to try just pure Kava root to see if I get more bang for the buck."
3,made me sleepy,it did relax me a little too much. made it a sleepy day for me. it does work well for the evening when too wound up to rest.
2,Not that good,I was not happy with product. It caused me to have stomach pains and feel weird. The first couple of times I took it I felt relaxed but faded away. I am also scared of the kava kava especially with stomach pains. Next purchase will be more of true calm by Now foods.
2,Did nothing for me at all,I was really hoping this would help me relax but it didn't help me do anything other than get annoyed. Oh well.
2,Unimpressive,"I was so excited to try out this supplement after trying out an even more commercialized version of Kava Root while in Hawaii. I was actually very disappointed when I took this the first time only to realize that it had very little or no effect. Compared to my previous Kava Root experience, this was so minimal that it could have easily been a placebo effect that I was feeling. With the drinkable stuff I had, I knew I had the real root when my mouth became numb. About thirty minutes later, I legitimately felt as if I had smoked a small amount of marijuana. Other people's reviews tend to say quite the opposite of my experience, so I don't want to say that Kava root has no effect, because it does. It is like a legal drug, and it's effects are great. Try this product out and I hope it works better for you than it has with myself."
2,I won't be finishing it,"I got more than half way through this book when I decided the only reason I was reading it was to do spell check and continuity. On Page 76 when you name Peter Jennings as Peter Jenkins and then reference him correctly later on, when you refer to one of the lead characters as Chris Heron and his name is Chico and start quotes and never finish them, well, that bothers me. I know it's not the writers fault, it's the editor or the fact that someone is just relying on their computer for accuracy. The fact is I didn't care enough to read more."
5,"""Mr. Sneeze"" never grows old !","The children in my family have recycled and shared many of the Little Miss and Mr. books by Roger Hargreave for the past several years. But the favorite seems to be Mr. Sneeze.I recently found an old copy of Little Miss Trouble that belonged to my youngest child who is now a junior in college. He was excited but said "" I'd give $100.00 for Mr. Sneeze"". It is still out of print, but amazingly his cousin still had my son's original copy! He was estatic to find it under the Christmas tree this past Christmas! So... Mr. Sneeze never grows old!"
5,great portfolio,"Was looking for an album to store larger family photos (10 x 13, 8 x 10). Perfect size. Saw this later at a craft store for a lot more money."
2,Won't last long,"I have some Itoya display books from years ago with firm, crisp, clear pages. The pages in this book are flimsy and will probably wear out and tear very quickly. Maybe they have another product with stronger pages."
1,Arrived broken.,"When I received this product, the sleeves were separated from the binding, where they should've been attached. Completely unacceptable, even at this price."
3,Good for professionals perhaps,"This is a textbook for those who are going into veneering as an adjunct to a professional practice. It concentrates on mechanised equipment such as large heated presses (but doesn't discuss vacuuum presses, probably not available when this was written: and in this shows its age as a text). It does not cover the techniques of hammer veneering, or other low-tech techniques likely to be used by a home workshop user. On the other hand it is excellent at covering the more timeless principles of veneering (veneer manufacture, stresses, matching etc.). As a serious and skilled amateur, it still wouldn't be my first choice. 2 or 3 stars for a home workshop user, probably 4 stars for a commercial practice needing a few reference books on the shelf."
5,"Mr. H. Ang, Computer Analyst","What initially drew my attention to ""American Apple Pie"" was the front cover; Ellis Island. As I began to read this interesting book of essays, I came to realize how a diverse array of people changed every day life here in America. It's about many people, different backgrounds, how lives evolved as all intermingled. The slogan, ""we are the melting pot"", tends to be quite true. At times, melting too close together for comfort, but inspired by each group to try, to mingle, to build a better life. At times, the reading may seem to jump from one life to another, maybe in an array of confusion; then it comes together. Its reality in its simplest form of black and white print on paper. Interesting, especially to those immigrants who can relate to portions of American Apple Pie. Not your everyday type novel."
4,"Roseanne Reed, Entrepreneur","I read ""American Apple Pie"" with great interest. Not only did I find the book quite informative relative to my own family heritage, but unique in its effort to portray life through the eyes of all mankind. I've often said, if all were born blind, life on this precious earth would be breathtaking for we would only know voice, not color or ethnic background. The book takes us on a tour of the beginning stages of everyday life through tumultuous times. It gives us food for thought on all facets of life through immigration and civilization then and now and in times to come. Easy reading."
3,Kinda flimsy,I expected the sides to be more rigid- you start filling this with figurines and the whole box seems to collapse.
2,"too small, too flimsy","This seemed like a great idea for all my granddaughters' ponies but it really too small for the My Little Ponies. It is adequate for a couple and their gear and, admittedly, the little girls didn't notice its shortcomings. They found it delightful. The cover doesn't stay on very well. It would be great if it zipped or latched on somehow."
2,Not what I expected,The box and the lid do not fit snuggly and it is a lot smaller than I expected it to be.
3,"Cute, but not quite what we were looking for.","We purchased this in hopes that it would work as a ""goodie"" for my daugthers unicorn birthday party. We only bought one to see what it looked like before buying several to give out at the party. I am glad we did because it is not really what we were looking for. It is pretty durable and easy to wipe down and keep clean, but only comes with one mini unicorn that is made up of light weight material and has a hard time standing up on the mat when it is folded flat. It would probably work better with a My Little Pony type due to it being heavier and standing better. I probably would not recommend this to someone that is using it just as it is, but if you were using it as an addition to other toys then it would be a cute add-on and a great continer to store extra pieces in."
3,Smaller than I imagined,"I didn't really read the dimensions of this product before buying, so this is really my own fault. We bought this for my 6 year old daughter to store her ponies in when not playing with them. It doesn't hold that much, but she loves that she can unzip it and use it for playing with and it serves its purpose. The unicorn that comes with the bin is kind of cheap looking, but she doesn't mind that at all."
3,unicorn play set,My 3 year old grandaugher liked it. Construction seems pretty flimsy and cheap. Not sure I would get it again. wish it was a litle nicer. Unicorn very small.
2,Neat Idea - not worth the money,"It is a neat idea, but the playset was not really used. The lid is not easy to put on or take off. The base unsnaps to lay 'flat', which it doesn't due to being snapped up. The 2 unicorn figurines are really cheesy, and my 3 year daughter wouldn't even play with them. Neat Idea, but not worth the money."
2,Unicorn a Disappointment,"I ordered this for my 4 year old granddaughter. The idea is good; the little case is nice. The unicorn is of poor quality and design. It is posed with its head looking back over its shoulder and the head is not moveable. The legs look like half a leg to a 4 year old... as they are one sided and hollowed out on the side facing inward. She asked if I would turn its head around... which is not possible. She then asked if we could find a better unicorn to use with the case instead of this ""goofy"" one. Maybe less discriminating children would like it... but I'm looking for a ""better unicorn."""
4,A little difficult to set up,"My only complaint is that the directions did not make for an easy installation. Other than that, once I got this working, it's a fantastic product. I love being able to get so much information out of my bike ride."
2,Not so happy with it,"Everybody seems to be happy with it, but i am not. The lower display line (with the distance) is too hard to read (think of riding in rain or in darkness, or of people with impaired vision); that's a major drawback when following a route sheet and depending on the precise distances. And the worst: the distance reset itself to 0 more than once for me during bumpy, rattling descents."
1,Quit working after 10 days :-(,"The box was missing a part (the mount to attach the computer to the handle bar). I improvised something, but the computer quit working after 10 days. Try some other brand is my advice."
1,Flaky after use in the rain,"I have, or rather had, two different Cateye strada bike computers. One was on my commuting bike, the other on my for-fun road bike. I bought them at separate times and both experienced the same problem. Rain made them highly unreliable. They would stop working in the rain and would work intermittently for several days after getting rained on. It was very frustrating for me. Additionally, they were unreliable in temperatures below 30F.I've since replaced these computers with a similarly priced computer by PlanetBike.I strongly recommend against purchasing the Cateye Strada. It just isn't a robust bike accessory."
3,Great while it lasted,"While it worked - great. Simple, intuitive, easy to mount, good price. However, lasted only about 10 rides. Then stopped working"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this a few months ago and have been pretty happy with it. I guess ignorance is bliss. I have recently noticed that the speed goes to zero some times. I'm not sure how often this happens, but it is enough for me to lose faith in this product.Today, I drove past my turn around last week. Last week, the odometer said 8.90 miles; this week it said 9.3 miles. There were some ""zeroed out"" times last week, I guess I just didn't realize how much.I don't look down at it that often, but it is disconcerting to be going 15 mph one moment and zero the next - at least according to the speedometer.Today, it cut out again. 10.24 miles out. 10.08 back on the same route. I know it cut out on the way back; it might have cut out on the way out as well.The route time was off as well...Updated 8/7/11: Same route, this time it was 20.52 miles roundtrip, compared to 20.32 last week.Time to look for a new one."
2,good product when it works,"I've had two of these. The first one worked good for about 2 months. Then the speedometer would start to go to zero, then would start reading after you'd press on the face several times. Since the first one was so new, i just returned it and got another. The second has lasted two years and it has started doing the exact same thing. I replaced the battery, placed the magnet super close to the pickup (now it hits when I pedal hard) reset everything, checked the wires, nothing has helped. I've talked to others who have not had this problem. Surely this has happened to others. Buyer beware."
3,Great computer,"I have been using this computer for 6 months. It's easy to use, however I had the bicycle shop install it. The battery didn't last two months. It would seem that it would have lasted longer. I had to reprogram the darn thing after replacing the batteries. It was very easy to do but I lost previous information. I haven't met a easy bike computer yet."
5,Can't put it down!,Her description the cryff and especially Talog seem very real and make you think that you would meet them if you went into a cave. Neasons' story line is easy to read and makes you want to keep turning the pages just so that you can find out what happens next and how the book finishes. This is a book I will read over and over again.
1,Nominee for the Worst Fantasy Book of the Month,"If there's a cliche that's been used in fantasy writing, the author has managed to find it. The evil churchman; the sorceress, the ambitious baron, the little people who live underground, the bandit raid on the village resulting in the killing of the heroine's parents and fiancee and her rape, the heroine who is a blind vegetarian healer with Sight, her companion wolf -- by now, undoubtedly, you have the drift. Add that it's all piled in together with minimal regard for consistency of the elements, and presented in a writing style that might be forgiveable in a 12-year-old first experimenting with the production of stories.Save your $6.99 for something better. If I could have given it a minus star rating on this system, I would have subtracted five."
3,Lonesome Dove Making of an Epic,Haven't had a chance to see this because I didn't realize it is a VHS when I ordered it. Hope to be able to watch on a friend's machine. Received in excellent time and in great condition. Aloha.
3,Nice reference book but not for beginners,"This book had many helpful tips, but more of them you can find online for FREE! It also states, it is for the beginning writer, to the professional published writer. That is NOT true! There is a lot of words in this book I could not understand. I found myself looking in the dictionary, more than reading this book.I think there are many other books out there that will teach you 10x more than this overrated mess. It is packed with colors, but how are colors going to help me write? Exactly, I need not say anymore.Mikey/PA"
4,Very good so far,"I purchased this book,along with Sue Grafton's latest. I started this one and am enjoying immensely. The people of Alpine definitely are interesting and make the series. The Bed and Breakfast series is great also. For me to not start O is for Outlaw first is very unusual."
2,I found this book to be boring and lacking in content .,"I founded this book to be somewhat frustrating. Some of the tutorials were ok, but most of the tutorials lacked detail information on the subject matter. I also founded them to be outmoded and boring. Would I buy a book from this author on this subject again?.... NO."
5,Was told it was the best,I am in a Director class at the moment. My instructor has been teaching Director for quite a while now. When asked which book was the most helpful he told us this was the one to get. I have yet to buy the book but I usually have good luck when I go with an instructor's suggestion.
1,Big mistake to purchase this book. BIG.,"I just can't put it in a ""maximum of 1,000 words"". And I'm not going to spend more time than I already did with this book. All I can say is that, basically, it sucks, that's it. Totally outdated tutorials that will work only if you own an old Mac, lack of detalied information on Lingo. I really expected much more from this book. Just don't buy it, trust me. You can get much more from your money."
3,"Creation, good. Lingo and ShockWave, inadequate","As a multimedia professional, I was happy to have a thorough explanation of changes to Director 6, where I could get an overall review of the tips and tricks. However, (and you knew there would be one) the book does little to take the reader into a full developmental cycle with the program. If I was looking to develop on this book alone, I would be quick to discover that the Lingo needed is not there, and the ShockWave section was only a handful of pages. With the need to develop, I would pass for another book (if I had not already purchased it) to allow a full creative understanding. Too much attention was paid to the pieces, and very little of the whole of multimedia development in this tremendous program."
2,Just copy Appendix B and leave the rest,"This book, as either a tutorial or as a quick reference is rather poorly written. Using the index is often an annoying experience because many helpful commands are barely mentioned outside the end appendices. This book is simply a mediocre beginner's tutorial and a Do It Yourself reference guide - after reading it you'll be able to get around the program but you'll have no idea how to script efficiently or other memory strategies which are oftentimes easy to learn and use but ignored in this book. Much of the book is an inefficient tutorial, such as the ""Profiles:"" selections and although the CD contains some useful things most of the sample movies are disturbingly poor. The book's cost is not justified."
3,"Not a Complete Guide, But Helpful","I've referred to this book several times, but was usually left looking elsewhere for what I needed. Good for reference on bandaging and I'm keeping it in my dog bag for just that, but I'm looking for something that will give me more for field emergency first aid."
4,Sloooow start; BIG finish,"Teen Anna Langtry fled her much older polygamist husband (and step-uncle) Caleb, hoping never to return to the family who betrayed her. Fast forward 15 years, and Anna is now a federal probation officer based in Denver. She has seen it all and yet despite her cynicism and belief that her new charge, confessed embezzler Joe MacKenzie will give her yet another sob story, she finds that she actually believes him and wants to help prove his innocence. But it means returning to the home town she fled, and facing unwanted secrets that'll inevitably come to the surface.Creswell knows how to weave a good mystery and this one is no exception. Though it initially starts out slow laying the groundwork and setting up the plot, the story is soon running at a breakneck speed, building plenty of tension with a stunning and cathartic ending. Joe is a stunning hero, with Caleb as a stunning (and very scary) nemesis."
3,Slow Cresendo but Great Finish,I'm a great fan of Jasmine Cresswell. But Third Wife was a book that I almost didn't finish. Her previous was very suspenseful and got to the point right away. Third Wife had a very slow plot development. I know it was about finding out who frame Joe and helping the heroine deal with the past and her feelings for Joe. But it took so long getting there. But the ending was fantastic. So for that reason alone GET THE BOOK.
3,Nothing exciting,This was boring and slow moving. I had a hard time getting through it. The most interesting developments were in the last 1/3 of the book so I was glad I stuck it out.
5,Great conversation kick-starters!,"My kids and I spend Sunday mornings taking hikes and having long discussions about life, religion, school, etc. We take this book along on our hikes as our springboard for discussion. I read the questions out loud and let the kids answer them, and sometimes add on my own opinions when they're done. It gives me a chance to chime in about what I think is important and it keeps us talking. I think these conversations also help build empathy, understanding, and listening skills, as well as helping us to all remember to think before we speak. Some of the questions are lighthearted and some are more serious, and none so far have proven to be offensive to my family's ethics. My kids enjoy the questions, especially my nine-year-old son, and look forward to our hikes & talks all week long. I'm thrilled to get glimpses into my kids' heads on topics that are well worth discussing but might not otherwise come up in conversation."
3,kids book of questions,My Grandchildren and i enjoyed this book almost as much as Book of Questions. I was amazed at the thought provoking answers and opinions these questions evoked. This was from a wide range of ages and backgrounds. I recommend you pull the family away from the T.V. and open up these two books.
3,Not Appropriate,"Although intriguing, many of the questions in the book are not appropriate for classroom use."
2,Item Returned,"Very elementary level for kids. I probably should have ordered this author's Book of Questions and would have found it fine for 6th, 7th and 8th graders."
2,Not Bernstein at his best,"Respighi's vibrant, colourful orchestrations are core Bernstein territory. These performances are appropriately exuberant, but the ensemble is scrappy and recording is coarse, and overall it lacks the perceptiveness that so characterised Reiner's legendary recording. Moreover, it is short measure: missing is the ""Roman Fountains"" to complete the trilogy. Ironically the most musical of the three, Bernstein never got around to recording it. Without any sort of fill-up, this is very uncompetitive in a crowded field. Even Karajan's account, which includes Fountains but omits the Roman Festivals, includes a suite from Respighi's ""Ancient Airs and Dances"" as a makeweight. Reiner is in a class of his own, but Muti (in Philadelphia), Ozawa (in Boston), Toscanini's pioneering NBC account and Gatti (with the Orchestra of St. Cecilia) are to be preferred to Bernstein's account."
2,"Written 13 years ago, very simplistic and outdated.","This book might be good as a simple review for children interested in kennels. I found it to be very simplistic and filled with a lot of ""common sense"" information. If you are really interested in reading it, check your local library, it is just not worth the money."
5,An Excellent Resource,Rob Linrothe's book is a must-have for any interested student of Esoteric Buddhism. It combines the author's knowledge of the religious texts with art historical analysis and provides a wonderful survey on the development of wrathful Buddhist deities from secondary attendant figures to objects of worship in their own right.
4,Ruthless Compassion,"Linrothe isolates the wrathful deities as an especially revealing ideological marker in the development of esoteric Buddhism. He identifies three distinct phases according to subsidiary, complementary, and central importance of wrathful deities in images made for and by practitioners. In a few cases South Asian images are cross-referenced with comparable examples from the western Himalaya, Tibet, and China, and Sanskrit and Tibetan texts are joined by select Chinese translations to stage a mutually informative dialogue between text and image.Ruthless Compassion offers a visual history of esoteric Buddhism centered on the changing representations of the wrathful deity. Its examination of a resource too long neglected by historians of religion and art alike makes Ruthless Compassion a uniquely valuable contribution to the field of Buddhist studies."
3,Just okay,"I'm a little surprised by the effusive reviews. It's OK -- what's a little unique is that it's organized by topic rather than chronology -- for example: weapons, battles, heroes, family life, etc. -- so you can pick up some interesting facts/perspectives. A ""hard core"" historian probably won't find much here -- pretty basic. I think either the ""for dummies"" or ""complete idiot"" book is probably a better intro."
5,Best avaliable,The best avaliable guide to the wood plants of this region of South America that I am aware of.
3,Pretty good!,"A much better alternative to using parchment paper or just the straight pan but this item is sort of difficult to clean (stays very oily) and mine got a small tear in it after a few months of light use. But it helps cooks things evenly, etc, etc. Pretty OK but I think there's a better one out there, somewhere."
5,The modern age of baking,"I love these oven sheets. They do away with greasing the cookie sheets, wash like a charm. Superb, would not want to bake without them."
3,not revolutionary,"The Silpat mat seemed to work fine, but cookies baked on a cookie sheet with parchment paper came out just as well or better. My biggest objections to the mat are finding a place to store it flat and the greasiness the mat retains even after washing and wiping, that just kind of icks me out."
4,"Corner problems, anyone?","I used my Silpat once, and noticed a lot of smoke coming from my oven. Then, after only one use, I noticed the silicone disintigrated in one corner. It looks like tiny pieces of silicone have peeled off. I'm going to return it and get a new one, but has anyone else experienced this problem? Also, any suggestions to stop the smoking?"
3,Good & Bad,"I love that nothing sticks to it, but like several other reviewers mentioned, mine smokes & smells & sets off my smoke alarm & makes my eyes water. My oven temps are right on, so that is not the problem.I tend to use it only for baking items that would otherwise be really hard to clean up after. For run of the mill goods I tend not to use it because of the smell."
5,Problematic,"Since writing my review last year I have had a re-think on the Silpat and no longer recommend it. It is, however, not possible to change the 'stars' rating above.Here is my reservation. One of the Silpat sheets that I bought experienced a disintegration of the silicone at the edges. A second one deteriorated, and I hadn't used it that much. So, when cost is weighed against benefit, I now say thumbs down to the Silpat.I decided to return them to the store and have gone back to parchment paper or aluminum foil for my baking."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"I was very excited about trying out this new product and was VERY Disappointed with it. I tried to bake a patch of cookies and it filled my home with smoke and terrible fumes. My husband is sensitive to smells and he had to leave the house so I could air it out. It burns your eyes as well. Amazon would not take the product back because I did not return it within 30 days of purchase. But, I did not use until the weather was colder and wanted to bake. Do yourself a favor and save yourself $25 and don't purchase this product. Rated 1 star because it would not let me leave NO stars."
5,Especially good for baking cookies,My oven bakes hot but I haven't burned a thing since using the silpat. Things get brown but never black. Absolutely nothing sticks and clean up is easy. I've had a silpat for 5 years. Makes a great gift for the people in your life who like to bake
5,Great help in the kitchen,"I love this.. I bake my bread, cookies and rolls on this. The cleanup is so easy, a damp cloth to remove any oil or crumbs. Saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil."
5,Love it,"We've been using this for about 2 years now, mostly for baking cookies. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and I have no complaints. When they say non-stick, they really mean it. Clean up is a cinch."
5,"Tough, Versatile, and Completely Nonstick","These mats are very useful, completely nonstick, and durable enough to survive many trips to and from the oven. I used them for over a year, every time I bake cookies or roast vegetables. Cookies and potato slices will not brown as much on the mat as on a bare metal pan, but they do brown acceptably. I have also taken advantage of their nonstick nature to roll out dough on and prepare chocolate candies on. Because nothing sticks to them, they are easy to clean. They do feel tacky or greasy, however, no matter how much I clean them, but that does not affect their performance in any way.These mats fit myNorpro 18 Inch x 12 Inch Commercial Grade Aluminum Jelly Roll Panperfectly.(It's fun to watch ""Good Eats"" and see that Alton Brown uses these, too.)"
5,These baking mats are great !,"We had been lining our baking tins with non-stick aluminum foil when that product became available. However the non stick version of aluminum foil is significantly more expensive than the regular stuff. So we were keeping our eyes open for alternative solutions. We have a number of Silicone based items for the kitchen so when these became available, I picked one up to give it a try.We both love this little mat. It stops things from sticking to the baking sheet which can make for a tough cleanup that could damage the pan's non-stock coating. It also saves us money by not having to buy that non-stick aluminum foil. Baked items don't stick to this mat, it has a nice slick coating on it. Cleaning it up is a snap as well, you just run a damp rag over it, roll it up and put it back in the drawer.We will be buying more of these in the future, they're available in various sizes. Great product!"
5,product is what it is.,i ordered this product fully knowing how awesome silpat was- i am giving it as a gift for christmas- order was delivered quickly and i didnt have any problems with the seller! thanks!
4,Amazing,"I bought the commercial, larger size for my sister to use in her bakery, and it hasn't failed her. This one is no different for me. Stop using butter and butter-flavored non-stick sprays and make the convenient choice, and buy this mat."
5,A Kitchen Must-Have,"The only problem I have with this item is that I only bought one! The Silpat really is great. It makes great cookies, doesn't stick and is a quick cleanup. I made a gluten-free cookie recipe and they spread out really bad on the mat, but my dough was also a little too liquid. I don't know if it was a combo of my mistake + the mat or just me. But everything else I've ever baked on it has come out perfect. Sticky biscuits work great as well as any type of cookie. Will try macarons in it soon."
4,"Good mat, not big enough.","This mat works well for making pie crusts, but it needs to be about 3 or 4 inches wider and longer. We have pie tins that are normal sized and on this mat the crust has to go all the way to the edge."
3,not big enough,"It is a good product, but it is too small for pie crusts and other things. It has a weird feeling to the touch, but it does shed flour and stuff. If you like the idea, my advice is to buy a larger size; I wish I had."
4,Wonderful,"I have used it often....wonderful. Nothing sticks, it's easy to wash. Only one problem I have a smaller oven so the cookie sheets I use under it are a bit smaller than the silpat and cookies slide to the center because of the higher edges of the cookie sheets. Measure carefully!"
5,Cookies won't stick!,Cookies won't stick and stay 'plump' on the sheet rather than get flat & crisp like on a regular metal sheet. I have a large one & small one and buy them as gifts for birthdays & xmas because everyone should have one.
5,Bakery must have,When I first discovered Silpat's I learned to love them. This item dispenses with oiling the pan with oil or spray. If you bake (or cook) you need these.
5,Nonstick all the way..,"From parchment to silpat, wow I've come a long way ! Thanks to this baking mat my cookies and breads look like they've come from a bakery. I ordered this for my traditional jelly roll pan and it fits perfectly. Needs very little attention and cleans up in the blink of an eye..Can't say enough about this product ! I would order this again !"
4,"Cannot make the edges lie down, but great mat otherwise",I love using Silpat for my baking needs. Everything I place on it slides off without a problem. My only complaint is that the both sides of my Silpat will not lie down. They curl up in the air as if they are trying to encapsulate whatever is on the baking sheet. I have tried sandwiching this sheet between two cookie sheets and various other methods attempting to get it to lie down. Nothing has worked. I am trying to roll it up backwards and leave it bound by rubber bands for two months or so. I have some other Matfer baking sheets I am using for the time being.Does anyone have any recommendations on how to make it lie flat?
5,whole cookies are so worthwhile,"nothing sticks..not at all. although, my silpat got an oily texture after i used it. i don't really mind it...at least i can eat my cookies WHOLE."
5,Great kitchen tool,I have three of these for my three large cookie sheets & make baking & clean up so easy. Highly recommend these if you do a lot of cooking.
4,not quite right,"Well, I thought this size would fit my toaster oven, but no such luck. It's too big for that, and too small for the cookie sheet. It's nice, if only I could use it."
4,Silpat 11-5/8 by 16-1/2 baking mat,Received within scheduled time frame and product was as advertised. Only wish that the Silpat mats would come in sizes that match standard baking sheets.
5,Silpat Non-stick Baking Mat,Product very good for the money us it on everything from baking cookies to pork chops. Easy clean up lasts a long long time.
5,a must-have,"This is an excellent item to have about the kitchen. I only suggest two things. First, I would purchase two: one for savory items and one for sweet, as certain strong odors and oils tend to linger. Second, do not use soap on these, a good wipe with warm water and a gentle cloth will suffice."
4,"Good, but this size is small","I have 6 silicone baking mats, and 3 are Silpat. The others are cheaper, 100% silicone that I use for non-baking. Mats like these are a worthy investment, and perform very well in the oven. But if you use standard 1/2 size sheet pans (like I do), you will want the larger size. When I am baking 200-300 cookies, it really helps to have a tray all ready to go while another is cooling and yet another is in the oven. You'll get a lot of use of the mats if you take good care of them."
3,Tired of the Smoke Alarm,"I was at a friend's house baking cookies using her Silapat for the first time. It kept setting off the smoke alarm which was very annoying. It wasn't even that close to the oven, and we had all the windows open. She didn't know anything about treating it first, which I read here and forwarded to her. I didn't see much difference than either from my pampered chef baking stone nor my ordinary cookie sheets, but then again, taste is more what I care about than looks.So if your oven is anywhere within 25 feet of your smoke alarm, beware.. you may be in for a surprise."
3,Amazon Prime ripoff,"I ordered the wrong size by mistake. No big deal (so i thought), all I'd lose is the return shipping costs. WRONG!! I pay for Amazon prime, I almost always have over $25 orders anyway but I do like the conveinance until i returned something. They deduct the shipping both ways including what was covered under Prime. For this item I only got $5.50 back...BEWARE. Wish I knew of this before.I frequently shop Amazon ecause of the return policy, this policy has me reevaluating that decision in the future."
2,a gift,it wasn;t as big as I thought but will work in the camping oven just fine hope I get to go camping too
2,I should have read this more carefully,"This mat is a tiny mat. I'm not sure what I'd ever bake on it. It won't fit anything but a pan for a toaster oven (which I happen to have so I'm keeping it because its more expensive to send back). Though I have these in bigger sizes - and love them - and have even sent them as gifts - in the larger size, I could have purchased larger ones for better prices, I got caught on the ""its only on sale for the next three hour"" thing.Good marketing Amazon, lousy deal for your customer."
3,1 item damaged,This item is wonderful for baking. Nothing seems to stick to it. Easy to clean and store. Transaction was smooth. The only problem I had was one of the items had a small hole in it and this item can not be used with any kind of hole in it. I have not tried returning it yet becuase I am not sure how to do that.
1,Not Worth the Money,"I worked in a professional bakery for three years and we used silpats for our croissants. In my experience, I found that the silpats are easily ruined and they don't hold up well."
3,Does the Job,"These are great for baking cookies. The only thing I don't like is that they get greasy. Washing with hot water and dishwashing liquid doesn't do it. You can still see the spot where the cookies were placed. Instructions say not to put in the dishwasher, but every so often I do it to get the grease off."
4,Kitchen Helper,"These mats are great, providing a non stick surface like no other. Much more useful than parchment and far better than greasing the cookie sheet and or pizza stone.There is some breakdown of the mats on one end of each from cause unknown but after intial breakdown (following five uses at 425 degrees F, there does not seem to be any acceleration of this breakdown.I'd buy then again if the need arose."
5,perfect for toaster oven.,"I use this for small batches of cookies in a counter top convection over(toaster) nothing sticks to it not even melted sugar.it cleans up very easily, just a little warm soapy water. so much better than cookie sheet/parchment ect... I think it was well worth the price."
4,Baking cookies was never so easy,"So, I am the typical household with baking sheets that are 10 years old. I put this on top for baking cookies and voila! No stick, mess or tricky clean up."
4,Still working great,I bought these to see if they would work in baking jelly rolls. I bake several when I am doing them and I go through so much waxed paper. To my surprise these work great! They peel off just as easy as the waxed paper and no waste. I have used them for many other baked items....even biscuits. The only two things I don't like are.... the high price and the corners are cut on a 45 degree angle instead of rounded. Neither of these issues have stopped me from really appreciating these mats.
5,Silpat Non Stick Baking Mat,This is a superior product that is easy to clean and bake on. No more difficult messing ovens to labor over. Love it!
5,Best for cookies!,I will never use anything else to make my cookies. They come out perfect every time.
4,Great product,Just love this. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because you can see the image of the products you baked after you wash it.
5,Nonstick Silicone Baking Mats,I absolutely love the new Silicon Baking Mats I purchased for xmas.They are wonderful. Really bakes cookies a lot better. I was alwaysused to burning the first batch until I was able to temperture theoven correctly. This was avoided. I'm going to continue to purchasevarious sizes a little at a time. I highly recommend this product.The price was great too.
2,"Silpat is great for candy-making, but not baking","Silpats are wonderful for baking. Peanut brittle, caramel, or anything else that requires a buttered pan works great on a silpat. However, I much prefer parchment paper to silpats when I'm baking. The parchment paper does not mess up the heat distribution, and in my experience, Silpats repel grease more than parchment paper, meaning that when I bake with Silpat, my cookies have more oil left on the bottoms of them (soggy middles) than when I bake on parchment paper. The parchment paper seems to soak up some of the oil, leaving a crispier bottom. Most people probably like Silpats because they're cheaper and easier than parchment paper. I prefer a better product, even if it requires a bit of extra work."
2,SILPAT CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!,"I purchased a silpat .. I pre-heated it to 350 and within a few minutes the silpat caught on fire. what a mess!! white/grey powder, smoke and flames. there is a white film all over my apartment and throughout my oven. i hate to think of what i breathed in, glass and silicone. I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT BUT WOULDN'T BUY IT AGAIN. I'M WRITING THIS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT OR WANT TO PURCHASE IT. BE CAREFUL IF YOU USE IT. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD CATCH ON FIRE. IF YOU ARE BAKING, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE IT UNATTENDED. I'M LUCKY I WAS IN THE KITCHEN, AND IT HAPPENED WITHIN MINUTES OF TURNING ON THE OVEN. there should be better marked cautions on it because i don't know why it happened. Maybe it is great for baking, but please be careful."
3,Yeah things don't stick but....,"It really is stick proof and easy to wash but I hate that the ""oily"" feeling is normal, feels like it's not clean. Also food smell gets stuck no matter how much you scrub. Will reserve this for extra sticky baking or chocolate dipped goods and just use wax or parchment paper instead. I would have expected for the price and brand something better."
4,Nothing sticks!,"This thing is great for any items that you don't want to stick. Seriously, you can burn cheese on this thing and it'll peel right off.The only complaint I have is that after a couple of years, the edges on it have started to flake a little but, and I keep having to trim it to prevent any of the fiberglass weave from breaking off into food.I'm pretty careful with it, making sure to only roll it or lay it flat, it's never been creased or folded - but it is starting to show signs of wear. I guess they're not that expensive so I should probably just replace it, but it's got so many good memories!A great addition to any cook at any level. You don't know what you're missing!"
5,Perfect,"You can't go wrong with one of these. I probably use it more than the wife does (and I got it for her). Makes clean up so much easier, since nothings stuck to the pan below. What is stuck to this, just wipes away."
5,Great Product Great Gift!,"When you find a great product you should share it with friends and family. I love this product - it makes baking a dream. The Silpat Silicone Baking Mat is a cooks must have. I gave them as gifts to my sisters and they both love it! I ordered from Amazon because their price was very good, it saved me shopping around, it came as described, and very timely."
1,RECEIVED THE WRONG ITEM!,"I purchased 2 large Demarle baking mats large size full sheet 16.5x24.5 and received 1 incorrect one! I have tried to contact you but there is no way to get this returned nor talk to you! I received a mat that is half the size (11 inch) of what I ordered. Please contact me I need the correct one!this is the one I ordered..Silpat Non-Stick Silicone Commercial Size Baking Mat, 16.5-Inch by 24.5-Inch ....and did not receive so far!"
1,Silpat,Silpat is non-stick the first time you use it. After that it is no different than any other surface despite the advertising.
5,Nice Product.,"It fits my 9x13"" glass baking pan. Love it! I use it to bake cake. Just make sure to remove your cake from the baking liner BEFORE cutting into the cake so you won't cut the baking liner. Really nice. It does the job!"
5,Good Investment for Workspace,"I recently moved into a new townhouse with a granite counter, but the granite counter is a TILE counter -- which made working on it annoying (the grout always got in the way). I bought this on a whim at a retail store for about $20 more than amazon, and I'm thrilled with it. I roll it out and I can knead dough, roll out cookies, and make a mess. It perfectly solves the grout issue for me, but if I went back to a solid counter, I would STILL use this mat; it's great for rolling out dough. Unbelievable! No more waxed paper to peel off, etc. Cleanup is easy... The only con on this, no fault of the product, is storage. It must be rolled, and not folded, so finding some place to stow something this big took some creativity."
2,"Has its endearing qualities, but.....","I can only go to 2 stars for this. Cookies baked on a Silpat spread out too much and turn out too thin and with edges that are hard. I tried several different varieties thinking perhaps it was just the type of dough, but had the same result for all types. For cookie baking, I am sticking with my Airbake sheets. On the positive side, Silpat performed beautifully when I made glazed almonds, which have a very gooey sticky coating that gets baked on. They didn't burn or stick, and the Silpat sheet cleaned up nicely as promised with only warm water. Since I bought this in hopes of baking phenomenal cookies, I don't think the expense was justified."
3,Overrated,"I'd say this thing is overrated. It seems that, with time, it loses effectiveness for some reason. I've been baking mini empanadas on it, and lately I really have to scrape off gunk that's stuck to the Silpat mat. I thought this was supposed to be nonstick? It doesn't help that you can't wash it (you can only rinse it).I'm uploading a photo of mini empanadas, shoved aside to reveal stuck mess that needs to be scraped off.EDIT: Ok, after some research, it sounds as if grease slowly reduces effectiveness. This was not in the instructions that came with this, otherwise I wouldn't have been baking frozen Mexican food on this thing! I'm sure if you reserve use of this mat for cookies and the like, you should be fine, just don't bake greasy stuff on it. I keep the review at 3 stars because Silpat fails to mention this important fact."
4,Silpat 11 5/8 by 16 1/2 inch nonstick silicone baking mat,"First, take note that this is a product worth having. Great mat for proper browning and non-stick according to my daughter, and she does a lot of baking. She likes it for kneading too. This was a present from me to her one month ago. However, I had to do some searching for a pan that would fit the silpat (a person's oven has to be large enough to use that size pan too); otherwise you have to cut the silpat to fit YOUR pan - the one that is NOT non-stick that you have on hand and need the silpat for. I could only find my daughter a cookie sheet in the proper size that was non-stick (go figure). I would like to see different silpat sizes offered and a recommendation from someone who has had it for a year or so (with use) to see how it holds up."
5,What I expected.,I'd seen and heard enough about Silpat (silicone mats) to know what I was ordering. I got just what I expected - at a very good price - and found it all that I had hoped for..
1,"ack, the smoke!!!","Bought a small one of these to use in my toaster oven, first of all, even the toaster oven size if very large. Next, when I started to use it, my husband thought I was burning something up the thing started to smoke so bad!"
5,What would I do without it??,I love my silpat! I've had it for about 6 months and gotten very good use out of it so far. Absolutely nothing sticks to it and it makes clean up a breeze. I no longer have to use cooking spray on my baking pans. It's very easy to clean - just wipe with a damp cloth.
5,A must have!,"i've been using my silicone mats for over a year and i love them! no more dirty baking sheets, no more parchment paper, no more cookies stuck to your baking sheet!i use my silicone mats not just for baking cookies, but also lining my baking sheets when i roast veggies, potatoes or make a meatloaf or meatballs. i also use baking sheets lined with silicone mats to catch any juices/drips when i make casseroles, etc. they are so easy to clean and completely non-stick! it's such a good investment and i can't imagine ever going back to parchment paper!"
4,gave as gift,My daughter used it right after it was opened. It worked as expected when used to bake a loaf of bread golden brown with the bottom perfect.
2,Friend Said It Took Noticeably Longer to Bake Cookies On This,"I gave a friend one, and she bakes cookies for the volunteers at the local animal shelter where I volunteer. And she said it took a lot longer to bake chocolate chip cookies than it did with a regular metal pan. Oh, did I mention to please adopt a pet if you are considering one? :) Today we had a mega adoption even where several agencies had adoptable pets and 325 pets were adopted today, and there's still tomorrow. :)"
2,silpat,"While I love these mats they are very much over priced and the one that I ordered from them was very small, while it is the size they specified and I expected so that they did not do anything wrong at all, I am very unhappy it takes two of them to go on one cookie sheet so that is why it gave it only two stars."
2,VERY small!,This is a VERY small mat...I know they tell you dimensions but when I received it I was very suprised! It will only cover maybe 1/2 of a regulare size cookie sheet lol
3,It's way too small,"This is my third baking mat. These silicone batking mats are good, but this one is really small (letter size), and I didn't notice that when I purchased it. How many stuff can you fit on a letter size mat? That makes the mat practically useless. You should go at least 11 3/4 -by- 16 1/2 (twice letter size), which is the size of my other two baking mats. A good product with wrong size can be just a waste of money."
5,It works as advertised,"When I was given one of these Silpat baking mats, I was skeptical. I couldn't believe that anything so rubbery in texture could possibly survive the heat of the oven AND act as a non-stick surface. Wrong. This cookie sheet mat works beautifully without my having to grease the pan. Cookies slide off with ease. (You can't use sharp utensils with the Silpat, so you'll need to use a plastic spatula or, if the cookies are firm enough, let them tumble onto a cooling rack.) Because the Silpat withstands high temperatures, I also use it for candy making.The Silpat technology is unique and successful. The line makes great gifts for bakers."
2,I'm one of the few non-fans,"I am one of the few people that doesn't think Silpat is the best thing ever. I love homemade cookies and I think the Silpat ruins the texture of a perfect cookie -- crispy edges with a soft center. When I used my Silpat, I found that the very edge of my cookies were crisp, but that's it. In fact it almost makes the bottom undercooked with a hard ring around the edge.I did a comparison and cooked a batch of cookies (sugar-butter cookies) traditionally on parchment paper and then one on the Silpat. I liked the traditional method better so I no longer use mine for baking. I still need to give it a try with other things. It does make sense for candies, but I've yet to try it."
5,Won't bake without one,These are fantastic nothing sticks. Every one in the family got 2 as gifts because having 1 is not enough. Wether it is the sil pat or the exopat you will love them. So order more than 1 you will not be sorry!
3,"Silpat works great as always, but it was folded for shipment and..","Silpat works great as always, and it fits my full sheet pan exactly. That's the good stuff. The bad part is that it was folded for shipment, and my other Silpat products always warned not to fold them. This one arrived folded in quarters with a crease down the middle that never flattened out correctly. After only two months, the sheet has split in the middle right along the fold. This means that it's OK for cookies, but if I want to roast potatoes on it and smear it with olive oil, it's going to leave a mess in my pan."
5,Great product,This is a great product for anyone in the kitchen. Whether you are an occasional baker or Martha Stewart this mat is a must. No more torn cookies!
5,Love baking with this.,I bought this for a friend because I love my mat so much. It makes baking cookies so easy and so good. We like ours good and chewy and this mat works so well for that. It truly is great for baking. I've had mine for several years.
5,Makes great cookies,"I originally got this to make bread, but have only used it for cookies so far. The cookies do not stick and come out much better than with just parchment paper on a cookie sheet. We just ordered a second silpat to do more than 1 sheet of cookies at a time. Be sure to wash it before the first use. My husband didn't do that and the cookies tasted funky."
5,Easy clean up!,I love not have to cut the aluminum foil or clean the pan. This is an ESSENTIAL for all bakers.
5,Great product!,"This Silpat mat is wonderful in the kitchen. I have used it to bake cookies, roll out dough, and make truffles. It is extremely easy to clean, bakes extremely evenly and completely, and works wonderfully with stone and aluminum pans. Wish I had one for every pan I own."
4,Great product but...,"This product is teriffic, but for my personal use I needed a larger size. I avoided spending the money on this product for a long time and when it was in my gold box I could not pass it up! Everything I bakeg on it was better, and I was a great baker to start with! This is a great product for a work space if rolling out dough too!"
2,Makes a good template for cutting parchment,"to fit my toaster oven.Cons: 1)Not all space usable 2) Biscuits did not brown on bottom. 3) Collects grease 4) A bear to clean and maintain.I'll stick with parchment paper, no mess to deal with."
5,Pays for itself,"This thing is amazing. We haven't found anything that even tries to stick to it. This pad has literally paid for itself by saving us from having to buy parchment paper as frequently.One concern I had at first before buying the pad was that the bottoms of baked items like cookies wouldn't be as crispy as before but those fears were unfounded. Heat conducts pretty well through the pad and the bottoms of cookies, biscuits, etc. are the same as they'd have been with a regular oiled metal pan."
4,Great way to save aluminum foil,"I bought this baking mat for my toaster oven as a tester to see if I would like it and be willing to spend more on a larger mat for a regular oven. The answer is yes. I haven't baked cookies on it yet, but I think it will be fine for that. I have, however, slipped it on the rack of my toaster oven (its really a small conventional oven from DeLonghi) and used it to replace aluminum foil every time I reheat chicken wings or cook pizza rolls, etc. It works very well for that and nothing has burned so far. I did have a burning smell the first time I used it, but I don't think I washed it well enough. When done, I just wash it off, which is really easy and lay it across the top of the toaster oven to prevent scratches to the top. I will definitely buy more of these, and I think cookies will work very well on this surface."
5,Solid and versatile,"I bought my Calumet 7500 tripod at the Calumet store in Escondido, about five years ago. I stuck a small ball head on there and used it in my wedding photography business. A few years later I added a Manfrotto 128 fluid video head, so I could shoot some professional video. It's one heck of a tripod - able to hold just about anything, and its black, foam protected legs look professional.I would definitely add this tripod to my Most Holy List of Photo Equipment That Lasts A Lifetime:1. Normal 200B Portable Flash Unit2. Norman P2000 Power pack & heads3. Hasselblad CM5004. Bogen 3086 light stands5. Nikon FM camera6. Stroboframe flash grip"
2,Reset button is not very functional,I have had a Cateye before and they seem to be pretty accurate. I bought this one to replace a Schwinn with a bad cable. I ran into the same problems that others reported with the reset button. It is very frustrating and the instructions are a little vague.I bought it from Nashbar so it will not be going back. I will probably buy a Schwinn next time. They are much easier to reset and change the wheel size. The link to the Velo 8 manual is here:[...]
4,My review of the Cateye CC VL810 Velo 8,"I used to cycle regularly and due to various reasons i slowed down and recently switched from a road bike to a hybrid. From previous experience i found Cateye brand to be a very reliable and a quality item. This one is no exception!!!You dont have to be a bike guru to install it. The instructions could be better but hey i did it...anyone can do it. It does not have the cadence feature but it has everything else including the Calorie burner calculator. Wished i knew what they based that number on. There are two sizes fonts...large for the number and the smaller letters for the specific feature (calorie, time, trip, odometer etc) and with my bifocal eyes the smaller letters are a bit too small . However, if i angle them a bit , they are big enough due to the brightness of the screen which makes the letters clearer and sharper. They should have the size of the fonts ...maybe one day they will have adjustable font sizes...J/K"
4,Gets the job done,"I was very happy with a Cateye computer that I used back in the 90s. When I started biking again recently I couldn't find my old computer so I bought a Velo 8 as a replacement.It works well, providing all the basics at a reasonable price.Two small negatives about it1. The cable is only long enough to reach the front wheel. This means you won't be able to use it on an indoor trainer. There's an extension cable available from Cateye, but then you're spending another $10.2. The twist ties, when cut, present sharp edges that hurt when brushed against. My Cateye in the 90s used a screw, which was a better experience, but probably cost Cateye 5 cents more."
3,You need really good eyes!,"Probably this miny computer works well, but it's too small and difficult to read ...can you immagine to stop in the street and try to read the information you need?"
5,Good value for money,"Finally,I know exactly the distance I am going!Plus average speed max speed and time on the bicycle. The only non accurate display is the calories burnt.I wear a HRM and my number at the end is by far bigger!So don't rely on this a lot....Easy to mount and use just a push of only one button.I like the cateye products.They look good and they are easy to use."
1,Not worth the money,"I'm so disappointed in this item. The instructions are horrible. You're left to guess between miniscule letters and bad diagrams exactly what to do. Even if you do work it out, reset is a joke. You have to take the unit off the holder, find a small pin to push in the button and then good luck. My unit won't allow me to switch to miles. Yes, I can convert in my head, but that's not the point. I WANT MILES.Save your money and find a better unit."
2,Belts,"I bought 2 belts that were size 48. They were too tight. Well, I should say the buckle fit in the middle of the holes with only two holes left. They fit more like a 46 so I exchanged them for a size 50 and I need to draw it up to the tightest hole for the belt to fit. I am confused. I took them to a local store and they didn't carry that style so I now have two belts that I really don't use and it cost me $116. Nice belts and if they sent me the true size 48, I would gladly return the size 50 in the box the new ones came in. The belts are nice. Thank you"
4,Granny Quilts,"The quilts in this book are so beautiful. Since I love vintage prints, I really wanted to get this book as there are many quilts that I want to make. The only thing that I don't like is that a special type of implement is needed for these quilts. I'm sure it's not that expensive. I just don't like buying new things in order to make the quilts. I read through the book several times to find out if there is another way to do the designs, but I couldn't find it. Otherwise the book is beautiful."
2,You Need Her Tools,Lovely quilts and looks like ones I want to make but they require her tools to make them. She does give alternate directions but its just disappointing trying to figure it out. I wish I hadn't bought it.
4,My Third Pair,"I wear my Keens almost every day all summer long. I wear them when I fish and I wear them out for walks on the beach and I wear them canoeing. I hang around salt water every day so they are subjected to a lot of tough conditions. I rinse them off with a hose when I get home every evening.So I wear a pair out about every three years. The threads near my ankles just give out, its always the same spot. They are so comfortable, I have no choice but to order new ones. Some people think they are clunky looking but I'm way past that.If they would hold up for four years instead of three, I would give them five stars."
5,The best floater / sandals I've slipped my feet into!,"I've always loved to wear floaters/sandals but always stuck to popular everyday brands such as Nike,Reebok.I was looking to replace my worn out Nike and searched around for a few months but never could find a good pair. I then heard of the Keen shoe brand in one of the online consumer reviews. I only heard positive things on Amazon as well and without hesitation decided to buy this (a gift from my wife :) )!Then I had to wait for it to arrive for nearly a month as it was stuck at the local parcel service for weeks (India).Amazon promptly, shipped me another piece (expedited shipping for free) since the earlier one hadn't arrived! This is why I been shopping with Amazon for years.The second shipment arrived on time.The shoe has been a perfect fit and I really like the simple method to tighten it. No Velcro so no fuss!I've walked in these for hours and have never felt so comfortable! I'd recommended this brand to anyone."
3,adequate,Size runs a little small but over all a decent sandal. This is my second pair and like original ones better.
5,4 years and still going strong,"The Newport H2's are the best sandal I have ever worn. I've had a pair of the Bison for four years and they still look almost new. I've hiked through muddy rivers, carried a pack and a canoe through an over grown portage in the BWCA, and still wore them on a night out on the town when I got back. They are simply the most comfortable and versatile sandal out there.I have to admit when I first got them four years ago, I came from open towed sandals and thought these were a little hot. But after a month break in period, they loosened to the point where they nice and airy when the bungee was loose, but snug and glued to my feet when pulled tight.I basically have worn these everyday when not at work for four years and finely just ordered the black color to change up the look a little. Once you go Keen, it very hard to find another shoe that fits the same."
5,Men's Keen Newport H2 Sandal,"Excellent sandal that can be worn anywhere. Plus that, it lasts forever! This is my second pair and I rate it top shelf."
4,very comfortable,"A very comfortable shoe that seems to be well made. My only problem is, I have a high instep that causes problems with shoes that have the tongue attached all the way up, like this one. It's tight getting it on, but very comfortable once on. It'd be perfect if I had a normal instep."
4,great sandal,"Wore them everyday for two months in the mountains of Costa Rica doing field research. Wet or dry, they are comfortable and handle terrain great while protecting your foot.They do breed the funk though, more so than my Tevas did from last year's trip, so I recommend packing some antifungal spray in your bag if you're going to be wearing these in soggy conditions with high humidity for any length of time. Despite that, they are a great sandal and I recommend them to my students."
4,...BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LACES BREAK?,"I like these sandals very much, but what to do when the laces break? I have sent Keen two e-mail asking this question--and have received no reply. No shoe store that I have visited has ever seen laces like these (bungee-cord style).Any suggestions?"
4,Great,We had to exchange another pair as the 10 didn't fit properly. These were a great option for the new pair.
5,WOW,This is my first pair of sandals from Keen. I have a wide foot and was skeptical I would get a good fit. They are the best sandals I have ever owned. Thank you Keen and Amazon.
5,Great Sandal,"I had never owned any KEEN shoes/sandals, I heard about them and even spoke with some co-workers who owned them. Well I had my old pair of sandals gave out because I used them to walk my dogs around a local small lake. I thought this was the time to try KEEN sandals since my old sandals were ""cheapies"". I found these Keens at a good price and bought a pair. After a few walks around my lake they were broken in. I found they were comfortable and a better fit than my old pair. I also thought about replacing my old hiking boots and found a pair KEEN Hybrids hiking boots and decided based on the sandals to purchase them. I have faith in them just based on the sandals. I recommend KEEN for anyone looking an good fitting pair of sandals."
2,Sizes too small,I returned the pair I bought - Sizes run way smaller than normal - You are best to try them on for sizing in a regular walk-in store first
5,Keen H2 heavy duty sandals,"These sandals are made of high quality materials and are well crafted. They are very durable, comfortable and bridge the gap between sandal and shoe. The enclosed toe provides protection unlike many open toe styles and the secure fit provided by the flexible liner material and heel strap keep the sandals in place even while running. The footbeds are very comfortable and keep odors at bay. Overall I am very pleased with the product and the savings over retail was approx. $20.00 with a wider selection of colors available through Amazon."
4,One of the best sandals I've owned...,"I've held out on buying Keens for a while 'cause I refuse to pay retail for anything and it's rare to find a good deal on these. The wait was worth it. Picked them up for 40% off and very happy with the puchase. The first Keens I've had and love them. There comfortable and feel very well built. I have two friends who both have worn the same pair of Keens for the past 5 years and they both feel they'll probably get another year or so out of them. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they're a bit of work to get them on. I have to use both the front and back loops, so both hands, to get them on."
5,Full Time Sandal,"These are the third pair of KEEN sandals I have had and the second one of the Newport H2. They are comfortable the first time you put them on with no break-in required and the fit is true to size. The toe box is roomy without foot slide. I have never worn socks with them so I can't report on how that works. The major pro is the toe protection. I use them for walking, boating, motorcycle riding, outdoor work, and every other activity including casual dining. They don't seem to leave marks on my boats and they wear better then most other sandals I have tried. I highly recommend them for active warm weather wear."
5,Keen Men's Newport H2 Sandal,"I bought these for my hubby after raving about my own for months - I took a punt and based my hubby's size using the EUR sizing to match with current shoes and sandals he has and ' shazam ' I had a win ... I've been wearing these in a Big Kid size 6 because it's a 39 but nice and wide for me and they cost less so I have them in about 6 different colors - WASSA (the hubby) loves them we wear them walking the dogs cause we usually end up in the water at the beach or in the creek and he thinks they're perfect - I get the one's with the closed in heel for myself, I'm a little paranoid about cutting my feet on rocks and coral which can end up in an ugly infection ... really really comfy and you just can't kill 'em - throw them in the washer or a bucket with soap to freshen if they get a bit on the nose."
5,Fabulous shoe,"Within two weeks of buying my first pair, I bought two more. A lot of people say to get a half size larger-I purchased my regular size and they were fine. I get a kick out of wearing my brightly colored shoes-they look so cheerful. From what I can tell these shoes are selling like hotcakes so I must not be the only one who really enjoys them. If you have plantar fascitis, these are pretty good support."
5,Keen Newport H2...Great Product,"The BEST sandal that I've ever owned. I bought my first pairs of Keen shoes about 3 years ago. And my first sandals a year ago. I've walked hundreds of miles in many different environments. Being a world traveler in many 'Developing Nations', I highly recommend a 'closed toe' shoe. You never know what hazard you might come across. With my Keen's I always feel safe. And comfort? They are the best! I'm in my fifties and 'always' look for shoes that my feet, knees, hips and back are happy at the end of the day. If there is one dislike...it would be the odor from sweat. A world of difference from my old Teva's, but still a bit of odor from the H2. And honestly, my feet don't typically smell. Something with the sole of the shoe and sweat. Even so...I will purchase another when the day comes to toss my current pair. From the looks of it, that's a couple years away."
2,Sizing Sucks,Nice sandal. But buyer be aware. These run ridiculously small. I'm on the small size of a 10 and couldn't even get my foot into the sandal. Took a size 11-1/2 for a decent fit. Before you buy try a pair on at a local merchant for correct sizing. Amazon's prices are low for this product but these Keen's run at least one size smaller than labeled.
4,Great shoes.,"I bought a pair of Keens for my trip to Glacier Nat'l Park. They are perfect for rafting because they have the toe-bumper in the front, so it's painless to wedge your feet in the raft. I also hiked for a few hours per day in the shoes, which was also enjoyable, but after a while my arches hurt. They don't have high arch support at all, so I couldn't wear them for too long. My feet got sweaty in the shoes, but they never felt too hot, and with a quick dip in some water, they're clean again (they also dry in a matter of hours)! They seem to run a bit small, so be sure to try on a few different sizes. The width is great, and the colors are fun. Sometimes sand or pebbles might get into the shoe and it can take a minute to remove (you will probably have to take the shoe off), but it's really not a big deal. Overall, I'd recommend Keens for their durability and versatility."
4,"nice shoe, but VERY wide","I've been wearing this shoe for several months now, and my only complaint is that it's a very wide shoe. So wide, you'd think it was unisex sizing. The problem is the footbed itself. Even though you can cinch the upper and the shoe is secure on your foot, you can't cinch it up so your foot can't slide sideways inside it. Otherwise, it's easy on/off, secure tread--never slipped on dock yet. And it would be fine for women w/wide feet who would ordinarily buy a men's athletic shoe. Also seems very durable."
4,Size is tight for high arch with need for wider toe box.,I originally bought my regular size and had to return them. Unfortunately it was to another seller beside Amazon and I had to pay return shipping.This time I ordered a half size larger and am pleased with the fit. Return shipping was included but I don't need it. The shoe wears confortably and will even be a little better when broken-in. Overall happy and can't wait for next summer to wear them regularly.
5,My husband loves these shoes,"I bought these for my husband for a snorkeling trip. These are his favorite shoes. Even after walking in water, the feet immediately feel dry once out of the water. They never smell, which is different from other water sandals. The toes are secure, the bottoms heavy and well made, and the inner cord is easily adjusted to provide a good fit. Even after getting them dirty with mud, they wash off easily with water and look like new. He even wears them with socks now that the weather is colder. A very well-made shoe/sandal."
4,Awesome Sandal!,"Great shoe. Like most sandals, I was skeptical to pay the price, it seems like a lot, however, it is well worth the money. I wear them all day from 6 AM till I go to bed. If I get sand or dirt in them, I rinse them out with the garden hose and keep on truckin'. Very comfortable, however, if your feet sweat a lot, I would be cautious as to ordering the right color, as I did receive a bit of a tint on the top of my foot from the strapping. All in all 4.75 out of 5 stars, simply due to the fact I can't wear them in the winter because it is too cold outside, and their's just something wrong about wearing sandals with socks!"
4,Men's Newport H2 shoes.,"Nice comfortable shoes for all types of wet/dry conditions and protects your toes. These are a lot better than the sandal types that are not good for walking down steep grades. (if wet, your feet push forward and almost come out of the sandal)."
5,sandals,The Sandals were as described and the purchase was the result of a specfic christmas request.
5,My second pair,"I finally had to replace my first pair of Newport H2s after 3 years of abuse. They are the perfect sandal for wading in small streams, hiking in the desert, and casual wear. I have especially been impressed with how durable the materials are and how well the antimicrobial material works. They really don't stink after hiking in them for a day. I am a bigger guy, so I usually go through shoes quickly. I really abused these and they lasted for 3 years.If you like to hike or fish small streams, these sandals are perfect. They are durable and stay on your foot without stretching when they get wet. The toe is sturdy and protects toes from hidden underwater boulders. The sole is pretty grippy, so it helps climbing over slippery rocks.The only comlaint I had about my last pair was they seemed a lot wider than marked. It looks like Keen has resolved this because these are true to size."
3,Sizing isn't consistent,Newport H2 Full Sandal -MensI recently purchased my second pair of Keen newport sandals. The first pair I got were awesome right out the box. I wear them all the time. So I decided to purchase a second pair. Same size different color. They don't even feel close to the other ones. I'm wearing a pair of socks with them trying to get them broken in. Seems that Keen is not consistent with their sizing. Hope they start feeling good soon or they'll end up in my wife's annual yard sale.
2,Poor Seams Don't Hold Up To Heavy Outdoor Use,I bought these to go canyoneering and hiking. My Teva's didn't have toe protection and the font of my foot would pop out.The sandals fit a bit tight at first and have become more comfortable as I wear them. I have a wide foot and these fit great for wide feet. They don't dry as quickly as I had hoped. They don't grip wet rocks as well as I had hoped either.These have become my go to sandals for outdoor activities.New Comments 2.22.11The seams tear out easily. I wish KEEN had a better warranty.
1,Cheap Dye and poorly made,"I like the Keen concept, but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal. I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple. The sun or salt water may have caused the change. I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation. The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach. When I hiked a rocky path, I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle. My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal."
4,Terrific sandals,These sandals are excellent. They are comfortable and easy to take on and off without feeling that they are about to slide off of your foot. I had heard good things about Keen sandals and these have proved them to be true. I would highly recommend them
5,Comfortable and rugged,I've been a Teva wearer for some time now and have tried sandals by others based on their model (teva).Nothing I have worn in the past had a closed toebox or a bungee for a shoelace and these shoes have both. plus I can toss them in the washer.Truly a great combination of a sports sandal and a trail shoe.I love all three pairs that I own and look foward to years of service with them.
5,Amazing!,"I bought these shoes because I needed something to get around in for a 2 week trip to Hawaii. I got them a couple days before we left so I had no time to break them in, but they felt broken in the first day I wore them. I wore them hiking and on the beach and on Volcanic rock. I've never been wild about sandals, but I can tell you I'm anxious for Spring in Colorado so I can wear them again. I'm a photographer, and I pretty much expect to wear these pretty much all the time during summer landscape shoots! I highly recommend them!"
3,Does't fit,"Everyone I know who has these absolutely loves them. For whatever reason, however, I have not been able to find a size that does not slide off of my foot... if it is too small, it forces my heel off the back, if it is too big, my heel falls off the back, if it is just right, my heel still fall off the back when I move. People rave about these things, but they didn't work for me (for context, I used them for a backpacking trip through shenandoah VA... I could not wear them to hike the streams because they came off right away. They've been permanently demoted to my stationary bathing shoes)"
4,Good Second Thoughts,"At first I thought spending this much money for a pair of sandles was normally not me. I would rather go to Walmart and get a pair of $25 Specials to last me a few months but the pickings are limited here on Guam (and no Walmart. A Kmart but no Walmart) I thought I give ""online"" shopping a try. I found these Keen on Amazon and based my choice due to the colors to be honest...Men's Blue Yellow Fade represent the Navy Colors. So I took a gamble and spent so-so money for these shoes and since they arrived I've worn them everyday. Their that comfortable. The next time I need sandles I'm going Keen again. Sorry Walmart."
3,Great except for durability of the threads.,"I saw them at REI, bought them, and liked them so much that I went back the next day while they were still on sale and got a second pair. I wanted to be able to rotate them. But, the threads in the ankle patch came undone. REI gave me a brand new pair right then and there. Now, it is happening again with the other original pair, both shoes, same seam! They need to use a much more beefy thread. I hate to have to drive all the way across town and back to exchange shoes.They are very comfortable, cool and give excellent grip."
3,Very Comfortable But Not A Boat Shoe.,"I did a fair amount of research before buying these shoes. I even went and tried them on at some local stores. I like the way they look and feel when I wear them but found them wanting for use as a boating shoe. More specifically, as a sailing shoe they are very lacking in grip on a wet deck. Don't buy them for that purpose as the rather hard plastic sole does not offer the secure grip needed for that purpose. I would also not trust them on wet, slippery rocks for the same reason. So, in the end, they are great for lots of other outdoor activity. Beware of using them for water sports where grip is essential to your safe footing."
1,Keen Newports can be hard on your health,"I've owned these sandals for a couple of years now. They may be an excellent dry-hiker sandal but they are not good in mixed environments.I have found that the soles of these sandals become an almost frictionless surface on moist rocks, stairs, etc. I took a bad fall in a tidal pool in Costa Rica two years ago and almost lost it on some wet stairs next to a swimming pool in Rio this year. I know, it takes me some time to learn a lesson. Thus, if your intending to get these for water/boating shoes, you need to look for something with a Vibram sole or some soft material, not these!"
5,Replacement pair,I currently have a pair of these which are getting worn out. They are comfortable wakling in them. The only problem has been small pebbles getting between my feet and the insole. I also use them on my boat where they provide great traction on the deck and don't leave marks.
2,Stitching Doesn't Last,"My H2s were very good on a Grand Canyon river trip a couple of years ago that included maybe 20 miles of hiking and a fair amount of stressing of the shoe. At day 9 the stitching began to loosen. Fortunately, that was at the end of the trip. I didn't consider repairing them myself; it was pretty clear stitching all over the shoe was loosening. I got a refund and would need confirmation that the manufacture of Keens had changed and improved before buying any more of them."
1,China Sizing,"The last pairs of Keen sandals I bought, for my wife and me, were thoroughly appreciated as to durabilty and comfort, but said to say, the ones we ordered this time were inferior in every respect. The sizes were marked the same, unfortunately they appeared to be meant for children. The material was overly lightweight and strange,definetly unlike the ones we had bought originally, which were made in the USA.Yours truly, Dennis Mora"
1,Poorly made garbage - do not buy,I'm in the process of returning the second pair. The stitching pulled out in exactly the same place on both pairs. The first pair made it 25 days. The second didn't make it 2 weeks. Completely out performed by a pair of Walmart Earthshoes. Beyond that they collect any loose material under the toes. Walk through a field of grass in seed and after 2 steps they're full.
1,High prices Poor quality,i purchased the Keen Newport H2 and within the first 2 weeks of use the stitching started unraveling through out the sandal-i contacted Keen directly and they chose to insult me because i mispelled a word in my response to them.If you research Keen (Google: Keen poor quality) you will find that poor quality is a consistent problem with them.Good bye Keen hello Merrill
4,Nice Shoe,Bought these shoes for beachwear and I love them. Look great and fit great. Feels kind of funny on the soles of your feet. They have little ridges and bumps on the foot bed that you have to get used to. I really don't like the feel on the bottom of my feet but sand gets inside too and I don't like the feel of that either BUT they are an open shoe and I knew that when I bought them. All in all they are a classy looking pice of footwear.
4,Good shoes,"I bought these after realizing my worn out Merrel sandals were no longer built...I'm not Keen fan, and I still think they look a little funny. But, they fit well,seem well made, and they feel great. I've worn them to work for a week, andwalked 5 miles around NYC and I am still happy.I think my proper size is a 9.5, and I heard these ran big, so I ordered a10, and that seems right. I kind of have to work to get them on, and I don'tslide around in them. The elastic lace seems to do little. I imaginethey will stretch out a little (not too much I hope) and the lacewill be useful."
1,Useless book,This book would be the kind of book that you ripped off pages to clean the dog s*** that you walked inIt's not a bible just a group of story to tell how this one lived or die pimpin...
5,Superb resource,"I don't own this excellent book yet, but I have read it several times as a matter of interest. I live in Germany and have found this book invaluable when going to markets where all this stuff is presented. Angolia's book allows you to distinguish between originals and fakes to a good degree, and gives numerous photographic examples of documents and paraphenalia that accompanied the award. In addition, it goes into great detail on what each award was presented for, how many were presented and some brief examples of citatations. If you have never heard of the german close combat clasp, it is probably because so few were awarded (at least humously). The criteria for many of the awards was astounding, and more astounding still are the stories of those who earned them. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for any level of collector or WWII enthusiast."
2,Not one of Frank's better releases .,"ShutUp'N Play yer Guitar was/is brilliant .This 'follow up ' is a failure .Whackerman is a great drummer for the Songs in the shows , but we're missing the amazing effects Coliauta and Zappa got going on the earlier album . Thunes is a hopeless throb throughout . His tone is poor , unlike the bass sound on SUAPYG .Here , most of the solos are just 'snatches' from songs . One or two nice moments , but they are isolated among a lot of plodding dross ( mainly Thunes ) . ..... waaay tooo much coffee and cigarettes . BTW , maybe the ZappaFamilyTrust could handle the Hendrix catalogue too ?"
3,for fans only,"some incredible drumming on these two cds. Zappa is on fire. But one needs patience with this project and multiple listens for the record to be digested. For hard-core Zappafile only, me thinks."
4,És molt bo!!,"Aquest disc és molt bo, té uns ""solos"" de guitarra acollonants. Realment val la pena.Us ho dic jo, que m'he escoltat tota la discografia del Frank."
2,Not the full length,These staples are not the long length like most staples. It takes 3 to fill my gun and I loose quite a few because when it hits the next group it always jams.
1,quality?,"I'm reupholstering a couple of chairs..having pulled out staples to get the old upholstery off I've now had plenty of experience with staple strength. These surebonder staples are impossible to pull out if you've tacked a bit of fabric on or need to adjust fabric later. Every staple snaps in two or sometimes three pieces. This means that I have to lift off the fabric from the short spikes that are left and then hammer the spikes down so they won't rip my fingers or poke through the finished product. Especially important around front of arms. This means extra effort = extra time. Would not order again.Revision: We used calipers to check the thickness of the old staples vs the new and the new were thinner. It could be that old staples from an old chair ARE thicker and that there is a new industry standard. It may not matter what kind or who you order from..they all are going to be thinner. Still, it's a pain."
3,5/8 in. Staples,These staples hold my fabric well but when they need to be removed they have a tendency to break. This really slows things down. These ones don't seem to break as often as the 7/16 in. staples though.
4,"Concise, thorough & easy to read",This book is especially interesting and easy to follow. It provides a sound overview of the history of dance with special focus on ballet and modern dance. This book introduces the novice to the legendary art of dance and captures the reader's attention with crafty storytelling. I particularly enjoyed the portion focusing on the history of ballet. Anderson introduces the reader to many of the individuals who shaped and popularized this art form while providing a firm background of the origins and development of this art. This book begins with a history of dance in the Greco-Roman era and brings the reader full circle with discussions of recent triumphs in dance. Anderson creates a book that is informative and thorough while presenting the reader with drawings and photographs of many influential artists and great performances.
4,Ballet and Modern Dance - a Concise History,"Great book, it is quite helpful for my students and myself. Enjoy reading it alot. I recommend to others thanks"
4,"My favorite ""Young Person's Guide""","While it's true that Bernstein's narration is sometimes awkward, I find even the awkwardness appealing - it's like listening to your childless uncle who doesn't know how to talk to kids. ""Peter and the Wolf"" brings back childhood memories of acting out the piece with my cousins; the wolf's theme still sounds pleasantly scarey to me. But over the years my favorite piece on this album has become ""A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,"" which is narrated not by Bernstein but by a young boy. His clear, simple speaking style is perfect, and nicely paced. By the way, this CD is essentially the same as ""Bernstein's Favorites - Children's Classics."" The cover art is less cutesy, and the music has been digitally remastered - but on my modest CD player the difference isn't noticeable."
4,"Good music, but slightly annoying naration","I love the three works that are on this CD, and I must say that the music is wonderful and very enjoyable. However, I was rather disappointed to find the narration on this CD. I plan to use this CD for music education purposes, and while in some situations the commentary will be useful, there are certain activities that will not be practical with all the interruptions of the music. While I would wholeheartedly recommend this for the musical content, I would be sure the people knew about the narration so they could decide whether or not that would bother them enough to choose a different CD."
2,grating narration,"The music is wonderful, of course. But Bernstein's narration is grating. I can't explain why his voice here seems arrogant, overbearing -- more concerned with his own image as a maestro than with creating a magic world for children. I long for the old Boris Karloff narration we had in my house when I was a kid. I'm going to check out David Bowie's some day soon and see if I like it better than this."
4,classical music done for kids,"I bought this because of the movie ""Moonrise Kingdom"" The children in the movie are listening to this recording on a portable record player. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it. Now sharing with the grandchildren. CJ"
5,classic recording,"This is a classic recording by the great Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and deservedly so. The playing and conducting are second to none, Mr. Bernstein's narration of the Carnival of the Animals lets you in on all the little musical jokes Saint-Saens included in his piece, and some of the young musicians doing the solos have become renowned virtuosi. The Columbia recording is transparent and clear. This is the recording to have of both the Britten and the Saint-Saens pieces, but the addition of the Peter and the Wolf performance sweetens the package. You will hear lengthy excerpts from this recording in the soundtrack of the motion picture 'Moonrise Kingdom'."
5,Excellent Introduction to Paiute Music,"Judy Trejo does a beautiful job with this album as well as her previous album ""Stick Game Songs""."
3,"Read it for ""Elsewhere.""","Unlike some of the others, I thought Stephen King and Joyce Carol Oates' stories were beneath their usual genius, but I loved ""Rio Grande Gothic"" and ""Mad Dog Summer."" However, it amazes me that fewer people have singled out the return of William Peter Blatty with ""Elsewhere."" The story is arguably the best in the ""999"" collection, as several characters (including the flamboyant Terence Dare) wander through a haunted mansion in search of spirits. Doesn't sound too original, I know, but we are in the hands of the master of ""The Exorcist."" ""Elsewhere"" shines."
4,A Feast for the Senses,"I polished it off in about 3 days. Each story fulfilled the promise of editor Sarrantonio; You got introspective, you got edgy, then you simply got Scared. King's THE ROAD VIRUS HEADS NORTH, while brief, offers enough mental fodder to keep the skin tingling. F. Paul Wilson's GOOD FRIDAY preaches the meat of that old saying; There's nothing like a Jersey Girl (even if she is a nun). Morrel's RIO GRANDE GOTHIC, while not inherently supernatural, offers enough of the ""normal"" world of psychoses to keep you on the edge of your seat word by heartpounding word. By far one of the most well rounded collection of stories I have read in years. It will hold a prominent place on my bookshelf and merits reading again and again."
3,Doesn't Meet Expectations,"In the introduction of 999, Al Sarrantonio expresses the hope that this volume will spawn a resurgence of literate horror stories and prove the harbinger of a new golden age of the genre. Sorry, Al, no way. Some of the stories are good but most are mediocre. ""Mad Dog Summer"" by Joe R. Lansdale is quite good while some, like the ""...Zodiac..."" story, read as if the author just threw something at Sarrantonio to get him off their back.It's not a bad book - something you might pick up what you have nothing currently at hand you want to read - but certainly not the catalyst that Mr. Sarrantonio envisioned."
2,999: new stories of horror and suspense,"Great writers. Mediocre stories for the most part. Yes, the Stephen King story is good and so is the F. Paul Wilson story. But some of the other stories must have been written on a break between their major works. The one exception is the Joe Lansdale novellas (Mad Dog Summer). This is a truly great story."
1,Not much scary about this book at all,Most of the stories in this book aren't very scary and half of them I didn't understand. Stephen King turns in a wonderful short story (Which is why he is the king of horror) but most of the others tend to sound as if they are trying to write some sort of high brow kind of horror story. There is nothing wrong with blood and guts and this book could have used a lot more of it.
2,Poor,"Bad writing contributes to the bulk of this volume. Some very bad, Bentley Little's attack of the killer pumpkins is typical."
4,Worth the money,"Hi stay in Cape Town South Africa, also known as the cape of storms. We get gale force winds and lots and lots of rain here. This suit has kept me completely dry. Usually with other rain suits I would still get wet on my upper legs, but this suit kept me dry driving through heavy rainfalls for 45 minutes. This is a well designed suit, and so far i'm very happy with it."
4,Three and a half stars,"The suit fits well. The zipper gets caught on the inner lining from time to time but other than that, I got exactly what I expected. Have stayed perfectly dry in the mid-afternoon Va. thunderstorms. Does well against cutting the wind down also."
5,Very good for the money,Rode in a storm so bad that all the cars were pulled off on the side. I was dry when I got home. Except for right at the crotch. I didnt fold the inner seem correctly. That or the lightning got to me more than I thought.
1,Trash/garbage. A waste of money.,When putting on this rainsuit the zippers keep getting stuck and you have to try serveral times before you can completely zip it. After a downpour I found my pants around my waistline and crotch area soaked.This is not a rainsuit. This is trash and the makers of this product should be ashamed of themselves for selling it. I wasted my money on this. I will never buy from this brand again. This rainsuit I will have to throw away in the trash and buy from another company that will not steal my money by selling me this useless garbage.
5,The product was delivered as promised.,The product is a gift to my granddaughter. We must wait to see how she does with her new keyboard.
3,Beginners Keyboard,I am an older lady who has always wanted to play the piano. I was able to buy a lovely Casio Keyboard and was eager to begin. This is my first teach yourself piano book. It is a fun way to learn to play but still a bit advanced for me. As soon as I get all the piano basics learnd I will certainly go back to it.
3,"Keyboard Yes, Piano?","One reviewer seem to think the book is useful to both piano and keyboard players, ""playing piano or the keyboard isn't all fun and easy. But this book is a good place to start"". I found to many pieces in the book are for instruments found only on keyboards. I also had a hard time keeping ""Mary had a little lamb"" out of my head when I was practising ""Merrily"" the first assignment in the book. However, I liked the books' philosophy on learning to play an instrument, and also how its' treatment of music notation. I found the notation in this book fill in gaps left out in many other books. I'm not a keyboard player so I don't how this book will be for them. I know that, as beginner piano player that this book will not fit my needs."
2,"Not what I expected, or maybe I'm not good enough","""How To"" books always get my hopes up, and I did hope to find a nice, solid path to playing the piano. Not concert level, just enough to get by. While I think the explanations are good, and it moves sequentially, I have to agree with my husband that despite following instructions, I didn't fill the house with joyous noise. Just noise. So I intend toget out there, just bite the bullett and find a teacher, and let him or her actually show me how, listen to me, and tell me when I've finally ""got it."" Maybe that's the thing missing that only a teacher can do--that a book just cant: listen to you and keep what's good and fix what's wrong. Well written, typical for Evans. But maybe more than a book alone can hope to accomplish. Will let you know after I find a teacher. Now, what's the best way to find a teacher???"
3,Excellent for beginners,"I am what you might call ""musically challenged"", but by slowly following the lessons in this book I have learned to play several simple tunes with chords and accompaniment. I'm having a ball. It's probably not for the serious music student, but if you want to learn keyboard and are starting from scratch, this is the book for you."
2,NOT the best...,"This cabinet was a big disappointment to us. It looked good at first glance, but then we noticed the not-quite-flush seams and the various scrapes, dits, and dings on the surface. Claimed to hold 200+ lb per shelf, but shelves looked bowed after about 15 reams of copy paper. Doors stuck together and were difficult to open and close. We had it for less than a day before knowing that it had to go. It cost much less than the brand we ended up getting, but the frustration was simply not worth the added frustration."
5,Nice crafts book,"I love the whole series from Malcolm Bird and Alana Dart, The Witch book, the Christmas one, the Magic one, I found all of them in Spanish, but this one is only in English, still I loved and made want to make a party right away."
3,"Interesting, but disappointing","I should have known from the jacket, all the people selected had far more than 15 minutes of fame, but the topic is intriguing so I read it anyway. One had over 25 years (by any conservative account of time) in the spotlight. After reading the book, I got the idea the people were selected because the authors had access to them and not because they illustrated anything significant about the aftermath of fame.The authors devote far more text to the RISE to fame and TIME OF fame than to the aftermath of fame. What little analysis provided by the authors is limp. Gerry Cooney is the only one providing any depth on subject stated in the title. Jim Wright gives a perspective of what drives someone to achieve fame in politics.I gave this 3 stars (and not one or two) because the stories were interesting and have value, especially the ones on Susan McDougal and Melvin Dummas. But the book does not fulfill the promise of the title which is a promise that deserves to be filled."
1,Typical postmodern babble by one of its great practitioners.,"This foul little book pretends to explain how fact and fiction can blur in the media. Sounds reasonable, but don't let that fool you; it's one of the most dense, awful examples of ""postmodernspeak"" I've ever read. Nichols seems to be improvising, writing beauties like ""The indexical bond of point-for-point correspondence between photograph and source anchors an iconic sense of typicality . . . and a symbolic layer of connotation and ideology."" No self-respecting writer--or writer who respects his readers--would spare that sentence the revision it begs for. Chances are you're a film student if you own a copy. DO NOT let it make you feel stupid. Nichols hides his ideas in such Byzantine prose so you can't identify them. If you can't identify his ideas, then you can't critique them. And that's just how he wants it. The price they're asking for this book is hilarious. Maybe I'll get my money's worth when I throw it at my professor."
2,"Nice Bass Relief,..... but...","Well, I am not totally opposed to this effort.. but I am not totally sure why FZ released this. As the story goes, this was written by a man in the mid 1800s in Italy by the name of Francesco Zappa, so this music was not actually written by THE FZ we all know and love. Synchronicity maybe, and it is NOT bad music.... so, if FZ thinks it was worth the release, that is fine, but I had it once on cassette.. and I really doubt I will purchase it on CD. Nothing really special."
3,This was a joke really,I doubt this really has much value . It is a good album for background music but it does nothing really and goes nowhere to prove anything . If you are thinking on buying this then by all means do so but it isn't really something you'd play very often
2,What's in a name?,"The music on this album was not - I repeat: NOT - written by Frank Zappa, but by the 18th century Italian composer Francesco Zappa. Frank just had his synclavier play it. Have you ever, while telephoning, been obliged to listen to some electronic Mozart while the guy on the other side is looking for the person you wanted to talk to? It's not THAT bad - I even enjoy this album at times - but you got the idea."
5,Well Made,"The Hull guard design concept was appealing, because in the past cylindrical fenders have too easily rolled out of position. I was expecting a little more oblong shape. (If you just glance at them, they appear cylindrical). Upon closer inspection, they are slightly elliptical. We've not used them much, but they appear to work well. Taylor has a great guarantee, even though we've not had to use it in the past. All in all, we're satisfied with these fenders. (We love the color coordinating possibilities, as well)."
3,Don't believe everything you see!,"I purchased this game with the expectations of having actual runway modeling shows. There is no catwalk to purchase which means you can't have a modeling show. The only catwalk is sold, and used like the disco rug in Nightlife. On the up side of it all this game offered more clothes. Not the most trendiest attire but more attire none the less. If I had it to do all over again I would have saved my money, and continued to download my updated fashions."
4,Alot of New Clothes,The clothes that come with the original Sims game get old after a while so I bought this...you get a lot of new clothes that are cuter! But I haven't quite figured out how to model it or whatever.
2,way overpriced!,"Just more ""stuff"" for the truly addicted Sims 2 Fan. Way too overpriced and now that it's in the game I can't find it! But I had to have it, didn't I? I'm not rich enough to throw money away like this...and I thought I was way too old to be conned so easily! Guess I'm more hooked on Sims 2 than I thought!"
4,Very nice!,"The Sims 2 H&M Fashion Stuff is way more complete than the previous stuff packs, because besides a wide range of new clothing, the pack also offers new objects to build your own H&M store. The new cash machine is a great addition (specially when compared to the previous ones), as well as the ceiling ""square"" light :D It also has a two-story window which looks very cool in modern houses. The male clothes are very nice, a shame there's only a few. The female ones are... well, some are good, but some will perfectly fit your sims with bad taste. And if you don't feel like building a whole new store, the game provides some so that you can get fashion sims right away! It would be perfect if there were more clothes for males."
4,"For what it is, it's pretty good","I don't know if I would really consider rating this Stuff Pack based on ""fun"". It's basically just more clothes (and a few decor items) for your Sims. There's a nice variety of clothing in here, and it helps to fill out my Sims' wardrobes nicely.My only complaint, really, is that there isn't much for the younger age groups. There's one outfit for girls (in a few colours), but nothing for boys, and nothing at all for toddlers. H&M; has some really cute little kids' stuff in real life, so I'm a bit confused as to why they didn't include anything in this pack.All in all, though, H&M; Fashion Stuff has a nice variety of clothing. Your teen and adult Sims will be more stylish than ever!"
4,perfection,"The service and the quality of the game I purchased was top quality and just as described. I got it the exact day after and it was in PERFECT condition. The game is awesome!!! The clothes are great! I loooovvee H&M!!! <333 It added a lot of cyuuutttee outfits for my Sims to wear and it gives my characters a lot more stuff to choose from. Though I wish it wasn't 20 bucks. If you don't care what your Sims look like then it's definitely not worth the buy but if you're like me and your Sims need to be fashionable then yeah, it's worth it! It's like real life; if you're not willing to pay 20 bucks for a shirt or something then wth? Don't. If you don't care as long as you look cute then hell yess! Go for it!"
1,The Sims 2 H&M Fashion Stuff,"I would not give this product any stars,even though they make you. It wouldn't work. A message keeps coming up saying insert disk #1. I only received 1 disk. The package was stuffed with balled-up notebook paper, the one disk, and the code nothing else. I was very disappointed and so were my kids."
4,Great,"i don't know that's it's really worth twenty bucks, but it does add a lot of clothes to the sims limited wardrobe... but i do wish it came with more clothes for men and more seperates for women.... but overall it is a good game. so the only reason i gave it a four is because of those minor details..."
3,Not Bad,"Great Product and definetely worth the money if you are a true sim fan. Tons of clothes for the price.One problem... I'm not sure if this is just me or others had the same issue. Once I installed H&M;, I had to uninstal seasons. For some reason, it wouldn't run both. I even replaced my seasons with a brand new copy of it and it still had the same issue. Hmmmm..."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought that this game was a bit of a disappointment. The instructions are not very good, and in the description it says you can make a fashion show, but it does not tell you how. One good thing about this game, however is that it gives you lots of cute clothes! : ) It is pretty good I just wish that the that there where better directions."
5,Wonderful!,Thoroughly enjoyable. Witty one liners. Endearing central character. Adventures that provoke the spectrum of emotions. Fabulous summer read.
1,Naxos Audio version,"I read the many reviews saying how funny these stories are to read. So, while I had not read them myself, when the audio-book came out I purchased it. The narrator reads the book in a Pepe LePew French accent! While I can take characters speaking in accents for short periods of conversation in an audio-book, the prospect of listening to an entire 6 CD's (7 hours) was just too tedious. I donated it the my local library."
5,Texas Music Must,"For folks that consider themselves Texas Music or Americana fans this is a must have milestone album. Billy Joe has other albums that I would reccomend first for the un-indoctrinated, such as the earth rolls on. However, the pure, real storyline and raw emotion associated with this album make it unique. More of a finishing touch on his dead son's unfinished solo album than a Billy Joe studio album, this album is tough to listen to without dancing or crying or both.Baptism of fire, sung by Eddy, is worth buying the whole album. I own most of Billy Joe's catalog, and I had held off on this one to pursue studio albums based on reading some of the other reviews (since Eddy plays on them too). I am blown away. Eddy was such an incredible guitar talent.King of Fools likewise.Buy this album. Also check out Eddys's guitar on Todd Snider's Songs for the Daily Planet."
5,beautiful,"This has thus far exceeded my expectations. It is so pretty... it looks like something I could have gotten from Home Interiors for about $50.00. I haven't had it too long yet so I am not sure how long it will last... but I will say so far it is doing well, the birds love it, and it makes a wonderful addition to my yard. ------------2011 update. . . it has now gone through two ohio winters without any care for it what so ever and has not cracked or broken in any way. though i must say the squirrels get more out of it than the birds do but thats to be expected without any preventative measures"
3,Bird Feeder,Well this is a very large and ornate bird feeder. The beveled glass is a bit much and the light weight of the feeder is not too promising .
2,This this useless if the birds doesn't throw away the seeds.,"I have 8 birds and they need a lot of food, so I bought this one. There is a major flaw in the design of this product unless the birds eat all the seeds and throw away the hulls new seeds doesn't fall down."
3,center cord not good,I ordered this feeder and it looks great but is NOT squirrel proof. I have had it about 18 months and the hanging mechanism had stopped working.
5,perfect gift,This was bought as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She loved it was exactly what she wanted as it matched several other items in her garden.
3,Tall Tulip Garden Latern,This is a nice looking feeder. It's so easy to fill with seed and very easy to clean. Nice feeder
4,"wonder about buying ""used?""","The info said ""used, like new."" BUT not so, there were no instructions in the box and the wire to manage the top was half stripped of it's plastic covering. We finally figured how the feeder worked AND hope the wire holds without the covering. The capacity of birdseed the feeder holds is great and it looks good in the yard. The birds flock to it."
1,Poor design,The tray at the bottom has holes to drain the rain water that get blocked by seeds. This causes the seeds to rot and the birds stay away. I did fix the feeder by drilling larger holes and mounting the feeder underneath the roof overhang of my house. I have other designs of bird feeders doing a great job of feeding the birds. Get better value for your money and buy a different brand of bird feeder.
1,Broken in less than two weeks!,"I loved the way this feeder looked, and bought it on line. I found the way the top fit to be annoying, but managed to get used to that. But within a week, the entire structure of the feeder was crooked, some of the panels had detached from the bottom, and within two weeks it was totally broken. My last feeder lasted for 4 years, so I know that this isn't about the usage, but instead about this very flimsily built feeder. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this for anyone."
2,Birdscapes bird feeder,This feeder is somewhat less sturdy than we needed for our strong desert winds so it was returned.
4,A good feeder for the money,"I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because the larger birds avoid it due to the narrow feeding ledges. On the plus side, it is easy to fill (holds around 6 pounds of seed). The lid is held in place by a sliding knob on the hanging cable. The cable extends all the way through the feeder. The feeder seems quite sturdy and has a nice finish. The little birds love it but if you want to draw the larger birds I would suggest you consider a feeder with a much larger ledge."
4,Bird Approved,"We installed this outside the kitchen window. Within 10 minutes the birds had located it. It's lovely and, at a distance, looks more expensive than it is. I like that the sides are plastic and not glass since the wind has knocked other feeders off the hook breaking the glass.The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that it's a bit tricky to open and close the top. You must squeeze a button on the cord as you pull up hard on button apparatus to open it. It's hard to do with cold, un-gloved hands in below zero temperatures. The other feeders in our yard are easier to load.If you don't pull the cord tightly enough before you release the button and lift it by the cord, the feeder flops over spilling seed in a very undignified way... good for the ground feeders but a waste of seed otherwise."
2,not squirrel proof,This item is not squirrel proof but looks nice. Squirrels had a great time with it. We had to take it down.
1,Desctruction by Squirrels,"I liked the way this feeder looked, but it broke after a week. The squirrels at my home bent the feeder so they could have better access to the seed. I am disappointed, I know I only spent $25, but I expected it to last more than a week. I am sure that if you don't have squirrels it is a perfect bird feeder, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,pretty but not made well,it's pretty when it stays together. but the slightest bit of wind causes the base and lid to separate. i will spend the extra money next time to purchase a better product.
3,HELP - CAN'T LOCK LID,"I must be a moron because I can not figure out how to lock the lid. I filled my feeder up with bird seed and then went to lock it, thinking I just turn it to the right or left. NOTHING! Can anyone help me?!?!?!?!"
3,Great looking feeder,"I read and reread the reviews. i decided to give it a go. It looks great hanging on the pergola. Filled it with seeds, and a few came out on the bottom. It rained and rained for several days. The seeds in on the bottom tray turned to gook because the water wouldn't drain. I cleaned it and refilled it with new seed. The sun came and so did the birds. Unfortunately they avoided this feeder like it had the plague. Two weeks, and it's still full of seed. I will turn it over in a garage sale of the future for a dollar. The moral is, don't buy a feeder for looks. Read the reviews, and if there are more than one or two negatives, stay away. Lessons learned."
2,Not squirrel proof,"This is a very pretty and sturdy bird feeder that has attracted larger cardinals and blue jays in my yard. However, squirrels are able to balance on the ledge of this feeder and eat the feed. Also, I live in Maryland that has experienced quite a bit of rain lately. The seed gets stuck in the slots and clumps into rotting balls. I've had to clean the inside a few times and now just put limited amounts in the feeder to prevent a lot of loss. This is a great feeder for those of you who do not have heavy squirrel traffic and a relatively dry location."
2,Squirrel's Delight,"I was very disappointed in this feeder, which came up in my search for a squirrel proof feeder. Maybe I should have known better, but it did it not stop the squirrels for a minute. The bottom tray is made of plastic, and when they knocked it to the ground it broke beyond repair. Since the rest is made of metal, the cheesy plastic tray is assumed to be aimed at encouraging repeat customers. Not recommended unless you live in an area without squirrels, then it is fine (if it doesn't fall down for some other reason). If you want to protect against squirrels, try something else. Made in China."
2,Soaks Seeds!!!,"The rain trickles down the cord... directly onto your seed... making it clump together and mold. The seed in the outter tray gets soaked and sticks together. I previously wrote an outstanding review of this feeder... but since my birds can not feed on molded or stuck-together seed, I must revise my opinion. Would NOT purchased this feeder."
3,It's nice at first but finish doesn't last,"I've had this for awhile now. The nice finish quickly wears off in a few months (perhaps because mine got a lot of sun), and it broke when I pulled the metal string too hard. As another review mentioned, it can get clogged at the bottom when it rains - thus requiring some intervention to unclog it.It's a decent feeder though, and it holds a lot of seed, just don't expect it to look brand new for very long."
2,Nothing to write home about,My wife ordered this thinking she was getting glass and metal not cheap plastic. Obviously it serves its primary function - feeding birds. It's a little too big to be included in a Happy Meal. Think it has about a one year life expectancy. Don't think it would sell well in the Hamptons. Great with a doublewide.
1,Poor packing = broken feeder,"This item arrived in a BIG box with many other items. The POOR packing resulted in the plastic perch/bottom cover arriving broken. I will attempt to fix the broken plastic, but am not happy about the products condition when it arrived!"
3,fun but forgettable,"Rabe captures the exasperating and priceless relationship of mother and daughter, her dialogue is sharp, and she includes touches of local Seattle color to make her scenes more believable. Unfortunately, the main character of this book, Shelby, comes across as somewhat manipulative and immature. She seems totally unaware that marriage entails more than diamond rings and wedding bouquets. She's twenty-three and has a Master's degree, but in many ways her emotional age seemed to be about 16. Maybe, in her short-sightedness and lack of self-knowledge, she's not that different from many of us in real life, but when reading fiction I tend to like my heroines and heroes a tiny bit more idealized. I kept found myself thinking, ""Kid, you have NO business marrying ANYONE until you grow up a little!""Shelby's mom, on the other hand, is a great character, and the subplot revolving around her is engaging."
5,Desert Island disc #1,"Hot Rats is my all-time, all-around, all-purpose recording. It is neither jazz, nor rock, nor pop, and was first wave of the Fusion revolution, setting a standard for Fusion groups for years to follow.What it's NOT, is one of those silly, audio-theatric Flo and Eddie compositions stuffed to the gills with silly sophmoric lyrics.I'm not gonna get into the jazzy musicology stuff that you might see in a review of that kind, but I can rwecommend a few things:Hot Rats is ""To be listened to under almost any circumstance"", especiallyfor: typing-your-school-paper, listening while at work without losing concentration, playing it for your kids without feeling like a foolish old fogey from the Sixties.One last thing. I don't know where I heard this, but that is NOT Frank, Captain Beefheart, or a ""guy crawling out of a coffin"" on the front cover. That is Andy Warhol superstar Viva cavorting in a drained-out Southern California swimming pool."
4,"I agree, it is a different record","This remix is inferior to the original vinyl product. Frank should have left well enough alone,( Mr. Zappa did the remix). I too hope for a rerelease of the original mix. The emotion in the original has been muffled in the new cd."
4,Blitzo,"The Best! Sugar Cane Harris played violin, not Ponty. Jean Luc Ponty first appeared on Overnight Sensation."
5,Try to get the vinyl version also,"As some reviewers have said the differences between this and the original are gigantic! Try to get the original and buy yourself a good turntable (and a good phono cartridge). In fact , if you are a zappa fan you should get everything in vinyl that you can as most of his older stuff suffered when re-mixed for cd. As for the music on this classic of 70's rock ...what else can i add that hasn't been said already!"
5,One of FZ's best,"This is one of Zappa's best, and that means one of *the* best and most inventive albums around. I first bought this in vinyl over 25 years ago and, while the original arrangements were arguably superior to those on the CD version, this is still a must-have album. Great on any level."
5,"this is a very good cd, even if you don't even like FZ","I have recently become a Frank Zappa fan and this was one of the first Frank Zappa CDs I listened to and it realy impressed me. The mix of instrumentals and some vocals makes Hot Rats a very good album. If you like this album, try Uncle Meat, Burnt Weany Sandwhich, annd Weasels Ripped My Flesh."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I see that mostly everyone is rating this album 5 stars, so I must be wrong but I just don't like it. I have other Zappa cd that I like a lot, like ""Overnight Sensation"", ""Apostrophe"", ""Joe's Garage I-II-II, and ""Sheik Yerbouti"" that I enjoy a lot, but ot this one."
5,buy it,"this album is the best durned album I own. the gumbo variations is my favorite insrumental jam, all of the solos carry you off to zappa land, buy it."
5,HOT Hot Rats,"As a long time FZ fan and owner of most of his work on vinyl this is one of my all time favorite FZ records. I have a first pressing of this on Bizarre Records which is just wonderful, both musically and sonically. I don't buy that many reissues from Classic, but since this was Zappa and approved by his wife Gail I ordered a copy. I was not disappointed! While the original 1969 Lp is very, very good, this reissue gives one just a bit more air and detail that you won't find on the original. IF you have an early pressing on Bizarre you could be very happy with it. However if, like me, you are a real fanatic and have a system that can show you the difference get this reissue. It won't disappoint you. This time Classic has done a very nice job. Also, these are the original tracks and timings not the ones from the Cd reissue."
4,Hesitant on Zappa? My review might help,"I've owned literally thousands of recordings from the 70's to the present and I had somehow never managed to pick up a single one of Zappa's roughly 8000 albums. I guess that formidable discography is intimidating to the uninitiated, and I never found his humor very, well, humorous. Still I had always heard that he had some killer instrumental records and that this was the best one.So I finally got around to it and was pleasantly surprised. ""Peaches en Regalia' and ""Son of Mr Green Genes"" alone are entirely worth the price of admission. In fact, that final run-through of ""Green Genes"" is one of the most transcendental moments I've ever heard in rock history. Gives me goose-bumps every time. The rest of Hot Rats isn't at that level, but ain't half bad either. I like Beefheart too, so his appearance doesn't bother me.I really liked this. If you're into adventurous fusion-y stuff but are afraid of this because it's Zappa, try it. I'm glad I did."
3,Decent,"Overall, this is a pretty accessible effort from rock music's greatest composer, and a good introductory piece. This doesn't mean it's his best, however. Pieces such as Peaches en Regalia and Son of Mr. Green Genes are great, and demonstrate Zappa's deftness in orchestration, a skill not usually found in rock. What turns me off from this album is the seemingly endless jamming. Gumbo Variations fits this bill perfectly. And Willie the Pimp is one of my least favorite Zappa tunes, not because of Captain Beefheart's cameo, but due to the really dull (to these ears) guitar solo. Zappa is a good, and underrated, guitarist, but here he just treads through uneventful noodling for around seven minutes. So, I'll recommend this CD, but only if you go out and buy Uncle Meat and Burnt Weany Sandwich soon after."
3,"A little let down at first, better after I gave it a chance.","I bought the album for the song ""Lovely Day"" and although its a good song I was a little bummed out about the rest of the album. The more that I listened to it I began to appriciate it a little more. But I would listen before you buy. I personally liked the songs ""Use Me"", ""Lovely Day"" and ""Who is he and what is he to you"" Judge for yourself."
4,very nice....for the price !!,"Bill Whiters is not just ""Ain't no Sunshine"" this i a very good collections of his best at a bargain price !!"
5,This is real music...,All I have to say is Let Me Be The One You Need is one of the most beautiful songs that ive ever heard...
5,the real thing,"i was a bill withers fan back from the late 70's (ok i'm dating myself) i was introduced to him when 'just the 2 of us' came out. i loved his voice so much i combed the resale shops and found the original recording of 'lean on me' in vinyl. 'grandma's hands' was one of my favorite recordings. bill withers is one of those singers who sounds as good a cappella as he does w/ grover washington jr. (the only person i think who can come close is josh white jr. - check out his album 'i can sing a rainbow') i always loved the smooth whiskey sound of his voice evident in 'lean on me', 'just the two of us', 'grandma's hands' and 'lovely day' i haven't seen the GAP commercial and really don't care to. i just will crank up my stereo and get the real thing"
5,...some soul + genius + ...uh...some more soul and genius...,"there is not a bad song on this disc!!there is not a bad song on this disc!!!dont make me say it again...this man is amazing and the songs he has written and performed are nothing short of pure soulful art!!my 13 year old daughter swings her allegiances between destinys child, the rapper nelly and lil' wayne...but even she has admitted to being soothed and comforted by the singing truth of mr. withers!come on now: use me...grandmas hands...lean on me...who is he(and what is he to you)...lovely day...i want to spend the night...hello like before...aint no sunshine.....man, this just goes on and on.you owe it to yourself and your soul to get acquainted with this as soon as possible. this is an american classic that everyone should own."
5,"Timeless, Super-tight grooves by an absolute soul master!","Everything old may be new again, but Bill Withers' songs are timeless in the best sense. You feel a happy nostalgia at first listen, but wait a minute and you're awe-struck at how solid the songwriting is, how tight the funk pulses underneath, and how Withers' voice manages to be emotional and exuberant and under complete control. No Celine Dion/Backstreet Boys wailing, just a jazzman's complete mastery of rhythm and music. It's shameful that Bill Withers' name doesn't come up more often in lists of the great soul singers (of ALL time), but people are re-assessing him in light of the recent commercial tie-ins (movie soundtracks, TV commercials, endless sampling by much less-talented rap ""artists"", covers that can never improve on the originals). This CD is all the evidence needed to place him near the top of those ""Best"" lists. Fantastic!"
5,Loved the Book!,"I have breast cancer with metastatic brain mets, so I can identify with Barbara Johnsons's brain tumor experiences. I loved the book, it made me laugh and was a real pick up. I found it lighthearted and motivational. I recommend it for any cancer survivor."
4,Made me want to help others,"I enjoyed reading about Barbara's experience with cancer. Her writing style made it feel like she was a good friend. I loved how even in her trials, she encourages us to look for joy and to reach out to others. Many times throughout the book it was told how she had hundreds of cards sent weekly, gifts, friends calling constantly, family doting on her, etc. I just wonder how the average reader would fare in this same situation if they have little family, are single, or have few friends."
5,Wonderful!!,"I have never had cancer, but I have a chronic illness and I really got a lot out of this book. You will LOVE the joke about the pastor's kitten at the end of I believe the next-to-the-last chapter--TOO CUTE!!"
3,Diaries of the Dead - OK for a rainy day to watch.,"This movie was disappointing. The info on the DVD made it seem like I was getting something like a George Romero movie and should have known better. Its not a bad movie, but rather something to watch when you have nothing else to see on TV."
1,Dead Summer,"I'll cut right to the chase: Dead Summer is far from being a 5-star movie. Budget constraints aside, I found the acting to be downright awful. In one scene, a character is shot in the head. Watch her fight to keep a straight face. Nothing sucks the believability out of a flick quite like someone who can't commit to a role. I got the impression that the audition process went something like, ""Hey, I'm making a movie! Want to be in it?"" ""Yeah!"" ""Great, you're hired!"" Also, there were moments where the story seemed like it'd be promising, but it was hard to follow the plot due to poor audio.Like all other low-budget films, this one carries the same characteristics: so-so makeup, pacing problems and iffy lighting. Please consider yourself warned."
4,Good Read: The Dream Merchant of Venice,"this moved fast, was realistic, offered a behind the scenes look at how embassies and espionage work but plenty happened too, people get killed and things. I heard the author lecture this year and he convinced a room full of people that he had been an undercover agent of the CIA assigned around the world thru the cold war. So I thought the book had credibility as well. Gordon Ridley"
2,Disappointed...,"Four padlocks, keyed the same, with four keys? Sounds great - but only three of the padlocks worked with the keys, one did not, and I couldn't send it back because we needed those padlocks immediately. I cannot recommend - obviously they have a problem with quality control. So we are still short one padlock - actually, five padlocks, if these worked for us I was going to get another set - not now. Disappointed, truly disappointed."
3,wrong book,This book got here when I needed it but it was the wrong edition. Who would of known? Good thing it was cheap
4,"Oddly enough, one of Kristy's best.","This was, strangely enough, one of the better Kristy books. (Most of the Kristy's are pretty good, actually.) This one stands out for her courage near the end in standing up to someone most people would never stand up to."
1,Quit working after minimal use,"I had this jewelry cleaner for less than a year before it quit working. While it cleaned my jewelry quite well, I was very disappointed that it didn't work for more time. For almost $40, it should have worked for at least a few years. Apparently there is an issue with the seal and water seeping into the unit and frying the controls... so it's poorly manufactured. Please don't waste your money on this unit."
1,It quit in 6 months!!,"I bought it in October, 2008 and it quit last week. I paid top dollar, too. It's too much trouble to return in now. I bought it to clean my glasses and it worked okay. It was very poor at cleaning my jewelry. Per other reviews it was hard on their ring settings, maybe mine was always defective as it did not clean my rings at all Buy another brand."
4,Cleaner,"So far so good. I still have a couple of pieces of jewerly that I would like to be sharper but guess I might have to take them in for professional cleaning. I tried cleaning one necklace numerous times, without the results I wanted. Good for at home use."
4,It works great,I am satisfide with the produck and love the way it works its eazy and simpul to use....So thank u for your conser andHelp with my perches.
2,"Easy to use, doesn't last long",Worked well for about 20 loads at 5 mins each (over the course of a month) then overheated and blew the transformer inside the unit.
3,"Not the most expensive, but not too bad...","Purchased hoping it could get the dirt & oils caked behind glasses nose pads cleaned out... Worked OK for most other things tried on, but doesn't do much to oily dirt build-up in tight spaces.Also, it's TOO SMALL to clean sunglasses that fit over prescription glasses.Sure glad I didn't buy from one of the sellers wanting double what I paid."
1,Broke after only a couple uses...,"After I bought this I didn't use it for a couple months. So, by the time I finally opened it, the warranty had expired. This was unfortunate considering it only worked about 2-3 times before it broke. Now when I turn it on it will work for a few seconds and then shut off, so I have to constantly continue to hit the on button and dink with it to get it to do anything."
1,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed with this cleaner. It did not perform at all. It just hummed very faintly with absolutley no cleaning action after repeatedly activating at the longest celaning cycle. I returned it for a refund.Bill D
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this item through Amazon and just used it. It knocked out one of the diamonds on my engagement ring on the first use. This is ridiculous. I realize you are not supposed to use ultrasonic cleaners on loose jewelry, but this ring is only 6 months old. If this can remove a stone from my ring it will do it to other jewelry. Do not get for fine jewelry. I am returning it immediately."
1,Died at 6 months,"I purchased this unit to periodically clean my jewelry. It cleaned my wedding rings well.Unfortunately, the machine died after 6 months of using it approximately only once or twice a month, which in my opinion, is ridiculous.I suppose since it was cheap, I could say I got what I paid for. However, I would not recommend purchasing this unit based on my experience.I gave it one star for dying on me so quickly with what I would consider minimal use."
5,"Great for ""do-it-yourself"" work and maintenance","I bought this to clean and maintain an antique diamond ring. It was filthy to say the least. Caked on grunge.I placed it in the tank with the plastic basket, and let the machine do its work at the longest time setting. It softened the gunk enough that I could use a stiff brush to work it all out of the crevices. I added two drops of Dawn Detergent to the water (per the instructions), and it cleaned it up pretty well. It looks like new.I was concerned about the diamond chip on the sides, but they were fine. The sonic waves are really gentle. The only complaint? They need to use better glue for the rubber feet."
4,As good as I had hoped for!,"I have other Abs Diet books and this one provided exactly what I was looking for to supplement those. I was looking for more great recipes and that is what it provided. The only disappointment is that all of the Abs Diet books repeat all of the same information about how the diet works...this takes up alot of the book. Overall, though, I would recommend the book and am pleased with the purchase."
5,"With easy, everyday recipes, dieting is delicious!","Unlike other dieting guides, the recipes in this books are actually DELICIOUS and ones that I look forward to making every day! (I've tried low-fat or low-carb recipe books in the past and have had disastrous results--truly tasteless or inedible concoctions.) These recipes are easy to follow, quick to make, and don't involve hard-to-find/obscure ingredients from the health food store. In fact, I don't feel as though I'm on a ""diet"" in the least!"
2,Disappointing,"This books simply seems like another way to make money using the Abs Diet label. The original book was great and even the follow-up but this adds very little -- maybe a couple of new recipes here and there. I did not need all the information about the Abs Diet all over again -- I just needed recipes -- very disappointing. Next time, I'll check something out at the library first because I never would have purchased this book if I had seen it first."
3,"Valuable for Abs dieters, but not enough substance","If you're following Zinczenko's diet, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend adding this recipe book to your arsernal. That being said, many of the recipes...well...they suck. There are some good ones, but not nearly as many as in the original Abs book. While following the Abs Diet, I did far more cooking out of the original book than this supplemental piece.That being said, there are plenty of recipes for sandwiches (though a cold-cut isn't rocket science), smoothies, at least one decent soup recipe, but the main area it's lacking in is really good creations for the main course. If you're overweight, you likely crave the main course."
4,Best Diet Cookbook,I have really enjoyed this cookbook. It has a variety of different meals to cook on this diet. The only thing that lacks is the time that it takes to cook the meals. I know it says 6 mins but actuality it is more like 10-15 minutes.
2,Not for people with jobs,"I read the other reviews that said it had duplicate information as a previous book, but since I didn't have the other book I didn't care and bought it anyway. I was still disappointed after scanning through the meal plans.The diet plans have a very heavy reliance on smoothies or other types of meals that are not practical for preparing or eating away from home.This is the plan for you if you eat most of your meals at home or use a blender and major kitchen appliances in the office or at school.I know you can make a few smoothies at home and pack them in a sack lunch for work, but in a just a few hours they will get stale, melted, separated and not look or taste any good."
1,Not for the Kindle....,"This might be a really good book - but who can tell? I bought the Kindle edition and it's nearly impossible to read any of the lists, charts, etc. and the font size of said lists can't be altered. If you want this book... do yourself a favor and consider buying the actual book instead of the Kindle edition!"
3,Good quick recipes,"This book has a lot of good recipes, but most of them are variations on a few basic recipes. This is not made for someone with a little imagination. It also is full of lots of information already found in the original Abs Diet book, which is good, but repetitive if you already have that book.Still, the recipes are quick and healthy, a great way to get organized and change your diet."
2,When 150 is not 150...,"This is the first Abs Diet book that disappointed me. I am excited to have finally found a diet that is practical and healthy, and was looking forward to a cookbook filled with great ideas for new recipies. What this is, however, is a recap of the entire Abs Diet for the first half of the book, and then a few recipies with a whole lot of variations. Many recipies are virtually identical with only one or two ingredients changed. I found nothing new that wasn't in the original books. If you would never have thought to substitute raspberries for blueberries, then you might find this book helpful. But for those of us who love to cook, (thus leading to a need for the Abs Diet...) there is nothing really helpful or new."
5,YUM!,"O.K., the recipe's are not what you would find in your typical recipe book, but they're nutritious, filling, & pretty yummy- Not at all like a traditional diet book. This diet has elements of Atkins, but adds food that is forbidden in Atkins. High protein, high fiber, low carbs, low sugar. It's only been 2 days, but I already feel healthier. Don't look at the scale right away. Mine showed an immediate gain of 2 lbs., but this is real food, not diet food. It takes a while to be processed. I've done Atkins with the same initial experience. You should notice the initial difference in the looser feel of your clothes. 5 STARS!!!"
2,Not for me,"I would have liked more out of this book in the way of exercises. Honestly, I didn't feel the meals were super lean unless you already had a high metabolism."
4,"Doesn't do everything, but isn't bad.","I started using the flat ice cream scoops a few years ago, and while they DO work better scooping ice cream away from the sides of the box, I kinda miss the nice round scoops! Anyways, this particular scoop is pretty good, although slightly TOO flat - ice cream slides easily off the edge if you're not careful! It does scoop all ice creams I've tried very well and I have no complaints, though I doubt the liquid handle thing did much. My only issue - it can't go in the dishwasher! It does clean easily though, but I prefer to toss stuff in the dishwasher when I can!"
2,Wears Out Quickly,"I like the product and the convenience of the built in bags on board, but it does not hold up. This is the second one I have had. Both stopped retracting. The most recent one at least lasted for ALMOST 15 months."
4,Works great - convenient to have the bags on board,"I have this leash for my miniature-breed dog, and it works great. Having the bags right there is very convenient. I like the retractable feature, because it allows me to give my dog an appropriate amount of leash in a variety of situations. The only con I have experienced it that the leash clip seems to be a little large and heavy for a small breed dog."
2,Retracting mechanism fails after a few months,"Having the built in bag dispenser is great, but after just 2 months of use with our 14 pound dog, the leash barely retracts (and won't retract the final 2 feet at all)."
1,Fifth purchase a charm?,"There are few alternatives to this convenient design. BUTIf you take your dog out in the rain, the cord gets wet and the whole thing grows mildew. IT TENDS TO STINK. The only way to effectively clean the cord is to take it out, but then one runs the risk of parts popping off and gee wiz... have to buy another one. Its one thing if a product sells because it is good. It's another thing to have to buy one because it stinks. And when it breaks... it BREAKS. If only there was a diagram to repair and replace the spring I'd give it a higher rating. :("
1,This is simply a Dog Leash - NOT RETRACTABLE !!!!!!! Do Not Purchase,Just received this product in the mail....I've had it less than an hour and it broke. My dog never used it....this leash is terrible!!! Do not purchase.
3,It had a couple of issues.,"This leash is good, but it did break, although that could have been from user error. It has been awhile since it happened so I'm not sure what happened exactly to cause it to break, but I thought that I'd mention that it did break. I was still able to use it, but it didn't lock down as fast as it did when it was new. It worked well though before then. I wished that the top on the bag dispenser snapped on securely, or screwed closed. It just sort of snapped on lightly. Overall, it worked."
4,great product,"broke after a year but that's probably from my dog always pulling. nonetheless, great product."
5,Love it!,"Love it! Love it! Love it! This leash totally outdoes the simple BOB attachment that you already have on your old leash. It's open on both sides so it's really easy to roll up the bags if the come unrolled, a problem that often happens when you have an anxious dog pulling at your leash. The grip is comfy and it still fits in my back pocket when walking off leash. Don't expect the hook to actually hold onto a bag though, maybe if you're standing still, but then what's the point?"
4,Good but not very durable,"If you buy a retractable leash, just be aware that it will eventually and inevitably break at some point.This was the second retractable leash I bought. I loved the first one before it broke, and I loved this leash before it broke. It worked well and the bag dispenser was very useful. The leash itself was sturdy, although I have to admit that I have a Maltese, and she never made me fear that the leash was not strong enough. It felt comfortable in my hands, albeit a little heavier than non-retractable leashes.Still, I would not recommend a retractable leash. Most expert dog trainers recommend that you walk your dog very close to you. This leash is 16 ft. long, which is way longer than you need. When this one broke, I bought a regular leash that's only 4 ft. long. Now I have a better command of my dog when we walk, and she's getting used to walking beside me rather than running way up ahead. I think that's a much better training tool than this long, retractable leash."
3,retractable dog leash with bag dispenser,"This product works well, but is larger and heavier than one we had previously. This makes it a bit more cumbersome."
3,Broken retractable spring on two previous leashes.,"Well, this is the second Bags on Board retractable where the inner springhas broken, difficult to repair. The case is very sturdy and takes a beatingwhen chasing fido down the sidewalk. We use the broken leash as straps onthe luggage rack. I haven't tried another manufacturer."
2,Do not buy - terrible mechanism,"The built-in bag bit is fantastic, but the leash wasn't retracting properly almost from the get-go, and after getting some sand in the mix, it was almost useless."
1,Broken by 20 lb. Dog 2nd Time Out,"I bought this based on positive reviews on here by people who claimed it lasted a long time with even destructive dogs. Since there's nothing more dangerous than a retractable leash that fails to work, I bought this 'oversized' leash rated for up to 110 lb. dogs for use with my new 20 lb. Basenji figuring that it should pretty much last forever. However, our second time out to the park yesterday, the stop button broke and let the leash extend to maximum... thank goodness we weren't anywhere near traffic.Honestly, with less than 2 hours of use by a 20 lb. dog before failure, I'd hate to imagine what would happen if you used this on a larger dog. What a piece of garbage. It's probably too much hassle to try and get my $17 dollars back to even be worth it. I'm not sure if all the positive reviews on here are real or not, but based on my experience... I kind of doubt it."
3,Poor quality but warranty,"I've purchased 3 of these and they have all broken. The inner mechanism just quits working after a while. I've been able to open it with a screw driver and fix on occasion but after a while that doesn't even work anymore. I just called the company and got a prompt answer. They have a 1 year warranty! All you have to do is print out your Amazon receipt and mail it back to them. The woman on the phone was very nice and I'm hopeful about a quick turnaround on the replacement. I'm going to order yet another one and keep the replacement as a spare.If this leash weren't so darn convenient (bags built in), I'd switch to a competitor. For now, I'm still hooked."
3,Retractable Dog Leash,I think it's a great price. The only thing that I'm concerned about is that sometimes the hold button doesn't catch right away. It's like when you catch a fish and he runs with it. This concerns me because my dog weights 90lbs and I'm a little nervous when cars go by that one time it might not hold.
4,"Nice Leash, but not as good as the one I had...","We had almost the exact same leash for years, before it broke a couple weeks ago. I liked it because the 'bag holder' and handle etc. were all one unit. That's why we went for this this. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.I'd really like to give it 3.5 for 2 reasons...1) The leash has a little rubber stopper on it so when it retracts it leaves probably a good foot and a half hanging outside of the unit. The retractable we had before would retract all the way. It's just kind of a pain.2) My wife walks our dog the most and she said this leash doesn't retract quick enough. She said the line will bow and lag because it just doesn't seem to retract like it should.This is still a great product. No need to buy a ""bag attachment holder"". It comes with 3 rolls of bags!!! We'll see if how it goes from here..."
4,Great,Great leashes while the last! Had mine for 2 years before it finally gave in...but it was my fault! I took it to the beach and sand built up eventually causing an interior plastic part to break.
1,This leash sucks...,"The lock mechanism is awkward, impossible to use with just one hand, and it doesn't always work. The unit itself keeps falling apart at the center seam, and I have to snap it back together. I never use it...it just sucks. It's only redeeming quality is the built in dispenser, and that's not enough."
4,dog leash,as advertised with the convenience of the bag dispenser. Durability og the leash retraction mechanism is yet to be seen over time.
5,Incredible Desk Reference,"How do they pack so much information into one book?The New York Times Almanac has become the 'first place to check' for me, and I get the updated edition every year. History, statistics, background information, little known facts.I'm amazed the number of times I turn to this book and find the answer I was looking for without having to dig further into the internet, publications, or other sources. Additionally, I feel confident I'm finding information that's accurate and verified.Can't imagine my desk without it."
4,Not what I expected.,"Although the NYTimes Almanac has different information than the World Almanac, and that information is welcome, it seems that is has more of the type of information I am not interested in. So it is difficult to make a sound judgment without my using it more."
5,Great pills,"I bought these pills for my mom who suffers from severe migraines and low energy. For some reason, she takes these as a vitamin supplement and it helps wipe out her migraines. She's been taking these for years and so far they're working great for her."
5,I like Ike!,"Ike Willis has an amazing voice, and his talent shines on this album. Frank has really outdone himself this time, the music it top notch and the story is good enough to hold your attention over the course of the record. This cd rivals Joe's Garage as one of the best ""musicals"" ever!"
5,It disturbsme to see this fine album criticized by FZ fans,"Yes most of the songs are remakes, but that is true of all of zappa's work; they have evolved to a point of perfection and been rendered into a poignant story in this album.From my experience the people who do not like Thingfish are the people who do not ""get"" it. In this case ""it"" is satire, and most people seem to be unable to grasp the subtlety of satire, or often lack the knowledge-base to understand more sophisticated satire.If you laugh at dark comedies such as Black Adder, you may like this if you are not overly offended by the content - if not, then not."
2,Zappa meets Firesign Theatre but he didn't get the drift,"This isn't one of Zappa's better efforts. It's ""obnoxious"" rather than funny--and the music isn't that great, either. Zappa hit a lot more than he missed, and even this is worth a listen or two. It sounds like a Firesign Theatre reject, which is what Zappa should have done with it."
1,Boring,"I am very familiar with all of Zappa's recorded works, and I love satire, humor and strong material. I find this album to be very boring. The ideas are just not that interesting. It makes me yawn when I listen to it. Frank missed the target here, in my opinion."
2,Thing-Flush,"I have been hooked on Frank Zappa for twenty-five years. The man could do nothing wrong, until I received the LP of ""Thing-Fish as a gift some 15-16 years ago.I felt betrayed by what seemed to me a blatant re-hash of previously recorded material with gratuitously foul lyrics. I had never been disappointed in a Zappa LP, nor have I been disappointed since. I gave the twice-played LP away and never looked back.If you want pure shock-rock, you might like ""Thing-Fish"". However, ""Overnight Sensation"" and ""Them or Us"" are far better examples of Zappa's genius."
5,How about Harvey Fierstein in the lead role?,"""Thing-Fish"" is an American classic, right up there with the best of Mark Twain. It is a brilliantly hilarious send-up of Broadway, in all its pretense and creative sterility. Zappa takes the archetypes and stereotypes of American culture, strips them of all their BS, and exposes them for the stupid, silly posturings that they are. ""Thing-Fish"" is Zappa's acid test for people who claim they can't be offended. It's racist, sexist, homophobic, vulgar . . . to anyone but a true Zappa fan. ""Thing-Fish"" is a drama, not another collection of songs and guitar solos, so stop taking yourselves so seriously and enjoy it for what it is: fantastic!"
2,too much talking,"I bought this cd but i just didn't get it. I am a big fan of the song ""You are What You Is,"" but having the rest of the tracks laying around unlistened to was not worth it to me. I sold this cd to a used-music store straight away.If you like ""You Are What You Is,"" I recommend buying the Persuasions sing Frank Zappa cd. Great version on that one.I just didn't get the humor in the guy's dialect. There was too much play and sitcom on this cd for me and not enough music."
2,"So, what's the big deal?","As a hard-core Zappa fan, I found this album to be tedious, gratuitous and lacking in just about everything that we hard-core Zappa fans love.Thing-Fish is mainly just a re-hash of re-mixes of older material, which so many of the later albums were. Certainly, his bitingly satirical bent is apparent, but lost in all the pointless scatological and sexually depraved rhetoric.There is nothing wrong with scatological and sexually depraved rhetoric, particularly when it comes from Uncle Frank. But when there's no point to it, what's the point?Get Joe's Garage instead."
4,Mélancolique,"N'ayant pas été acceptée comme mannequin chez la Société de Rayonne et Soierie, la narratrice quitte Lyon pour Paris et trouve refuge chez Mireille Maximoff qu'elle a rencontrée au cours de ses vacances à Torremolinos, en Espagne. Elle commence une liaison avec ""Guy Vincent"" alias Alberto Zymbalist, homme énigmatique qui exerce une profession indéfinissable dans une ""Agence"", avec des ""associés"". ""C'était le vide qui m'attirait aussi chez lui. Je le trouvais mystérieux, insaisissable"" dit la narratrice. Un jour elle s'approche de l'htel où Guy réside. Le btiment est encerclé par la police. Guy est-il mort ou a-t-il été arrté? On ne le saura jamais. C'est l'histoire de la première inconnue de ce roman de Patrick Modiano et le lecteur en découvrira deux autres. Atmosphère triste, mélancolie, destinées floues et tragiques, voilà comme toujours ce qui fait la force de cet auteur."
5,Eureka!,"This book makes sense!!! This is a must read for anyone who is looking to get fit. If you are trying to lose 5 lbs or 50 lbs, the real life stories help you feel that you are not alone in your quest for health. As a personal trainer, the information in this book is valuable. The program designed in this book is a great supplement to the strength training excercises I recommend to my clients."
5,empowering,this word is still an understatement to describe this book. IT's all about getting people moving towards a more active lifestyle at their own pace. It truly changes the way we think about working out. It's educational and well documented. Simply fabulous.
1,Shows how an articulate person can make rubbish convincing,"This book is a perfect example of how anything can be made to sound convincing by a writer that is good enough. Gould uses a lot of smoke and mirrors to obscure his essentially political argument and present it as scientifically valid when it plainly isn't, whatever so many of the readers here represented may think.The techniques of IQ testing that he criticizes have not been used for many years. He is recycling old material. There are many, many studies that show there are real, and therefore measurable, differences in people's intellectual capacity - and why would that be controversial? You meet smart and dumb people every day. Modern IQ tesing is not perfect but it is improving, it is at least based on scientific method and it can prove its results - something that Gould cannot.Gould's book is reassuring to people who want to have their own preconceptions confirmed, but it's certainly not good science."
3,Too Descriptive,"I never knew the whole story about I.Q. testing and I'm glad my professor required this book for my U.S. Minority Group Sociology class. It took a while for me to be able to get into the book because it is way too descriptive for my liking, but I eventually got into the swing of things and took notes. All in all, I'm glad I read the book and got a better understanding of what the I.Q. test is, what it does, and how it should have been used. If you're one of those people who thinks the I.Q. test is the only test to measure how smart someone is, go ahead and read this book and get a rude awakening."
5,Required reading for scientists,"All prospective scientists should be required to read this book. It shows pitfalls in ""objective"" observation. Excellent - as are all of Gould's books."
1,unscientific,"In this book Gould uses biased arguments to refute the scientific facts about racial differences (Bell curve, etc.) Gould's poor arguments are no match for Arthur Jensen's recent book, The g Factor (1998), which I recommend instead. One problem with Gould is that he is a paleontologist, not a psychologist, and really incompetent in matters of psychology. Also his bolchevism has pushed him to be untrue to evolution, I recommend the books of Dawkins over those of Gould, who has betrayed Darwin. A third problem with Gould is that he follows the fundamentalists in refusing that evolution be true also in ethics and politics (as is very clear in his book Rocks of the Age). I recommend instead books that are sound on these issues: Why Race matters (by Michael Levin); Race, Evolution and Behavior : A Life History Perspective (by J. P. Rushton); Mein Kampf; The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.)"
2,Not a Psychologist,"Gould is not a psychologist, nor does he understand statistics.The authors of the particular statistical tests he writes about discredited those approaches long ago see Jensen's g-factor for a detailed explaination and history. The book is still somewhat historically interesting but psychometrically meaningless."
3,meh,"The book was long and could be tedious. I had to read it for summer reading for University of Texas, and it wasnt horrible but it was definately not a light read. The facts were really interesting and they really kept me reading, but the points seemed repetitive and the writing extremely intellectual and sometimes hard to understand (as should be expected I suppose). It'll be hard to get through if you're not familiar with statistics. Having taken a highschool Statistics AP class I could semi-grasp some of the mathematical concepts, but they were still pretty complex, definately not light reading. However, if you want a comprehensive study of the history of intelligence testing and scientific prejudices, this book is great and I would definately recommend it."
2,Required to read,"Not worth reading for leisure. This was a required read for an Evolutionary Biology Readings course, and this was the least useful of all of them.It feels like the author is yelling at you throughout the book. Gould seems extremely biased.It is worthwhile to read if you need alternate views on intelligence testing or the bell curve, but the mathematics the author puts such emphasis on seems to just criticize.Take a statistics course, it is much more useful than this book and much more worth the money.Gould must have some sort of vendetta that his never-ending introduction puts you in an angry state about science before you get to the actual science in the book."
1,Dishonest,Gould is a talented writer but not a scientifically impartial one. This book has more factual errors per page than any book I've ever read.
1,For the soft-minded,"Noticing that a book was on the market that rehashed the same, tired old 1960's idocy that there is ""no difference"" between races (subspecies) of homo sapiens, my ever-so-PC liberal arts college gobbled up copies of this book and distributed them as required reading for evolutionary psychology classes. Overall, this book was a big waste of time and contributed NOTHING to what is otherwise a fine field of study. Simple, regressive logic such as ""just because some 19th century racists drew exaggerated pictures of blacks to make them look like apes"" this means there are no differences between subspecies of human beings that evolved in isolated environments over 100,000's of years. Pure nonsense and totally worthless; not ""scholarly"" at all but rather an amateur foray into ""science"" for the feminist/ultra-left crowds."
1,Old wine,I'd just like to note that this ground has been covered and recovered. See Science and Politics of IQby Leon J. Kamin for an earlier treatment of these issues.
5,Excellent historical overview,"Any book by the brilliant Stephen Jay Gould is a great read; this classic is a fascinating study of the history of IQ testing. In his characteristically lively and engaging style, Gould lays out the history, from the early days of craniometry and craniology to the idea of IQ as a unitary, hereditary construct to the U.S. Army's ill-fated mental testing program and beyond. A must-read for psychologists and anyone else interested in the history of intelligence testing and its roots in the racist eugenics movement."
5,An excellent critique of psychometrics,"While it is true that this book does not address the current state of psychological testing, its critique of the field overall through an examination of its origin is invaluable."
4,Interesting Review of institutionalized Prejudice,"Dr. Gould goes through how science was made to fit the prevailing stereotypes and ""scientific theories"" of the day. Gould discusses how scientists often had to create ""new theories"" to support large brain verses small brain, and the correlated ""ranking"" of races by the results which were often ""massaged"" to match up to the scientific understanding of the day. IQ is also discussed, as well as a rebuttal to The Bell Curve which inspired Gould to write this thought provoking book. Anyone in Science and Public Health should read this book...before formulating theories based on common notions."
4,Great book,"Not a light read by any stretch, but nevertheless a great book about an interesting topic, namely, the history and procedural/logical flaws underlying the deterministic conclusion that our intelligence is a unitary, hereditary, and unchangeable ""thing."" I really enjoyed the first few chapters describing the efforts over the last couple hundred years to conclusively link mental inferiority with race and/or sex. The 7th chapter, which delves into the basics of factor analysis and why ""correlation is not causation"" was a bit of a slog, but well worth understanding."
2,A Real Axe Grinder,"Gould is a very interesting speaker and writer. This work systematically beats the absolute living poop out of the practice of intelligence testing. However, me thinks this brilliant author who is said to have sired a disabled child doth have a very serious axe to grind and may not be giving ""equal air time"" to the opposing viewpoint. This book reads more like an all out attack than a pro vs. con treatise. Still, the book is worth reading for anyone who contemplates doing a factor analysis and would like to get some broad perspective on the history of same."
1,Political correctness disguissed as scientific arguments,"Gould has utterly dissapointed me by writing this tabloid about how nature ""ought to be"" rather than how nature behaves. He knows little about psychology and statistics while leading the reader into flawed arguments about the differences (or otherwise) of various human races.There is no doubt whatsoever that Gould is pushing a typical social engineering, pseuo-academic, political correct agenda. I feel sorry for science for having individuals such as Gould, who, instead of observing nature and fomulatinng theories about it, jumps into left-wind propaganda of how everyone is and has been wronged and exploted by white, middle-class Europeans.I think that Gould has made a fool of himself with the scientific community."
3,"A good book, but","Although the book is interesting in its content and writing style, the book remains historical in content. If we live by the presumption that our worlds are as only we can ""perceive"" them, the selfish gene, inbox thinking... and that women have been tormented for generations by men's self preservation(e.g. women being unintelligent, unavailability of schooling, work...), this books history and analysis of intelligence through time and culture only seems to be obvious. Perhaps I would have preferred a discussion and refutal of cognitive concepts along with the history lesson and cultural norms. This of course seen from a high school drop out point of view. I could imagine as a graduate student I would be excited to assimilate the content of the book with what I would have learned in school, but disappointed none-the-less."
4,Great book for beginners,"After a long search and 3 PHP books later, I have finally found something that was perfectly structured and EASY TO UNDERSTAND. If you are looking to learn PHP fast, start with this book. 4 stars instead of 5 only because its a bit dated, though still an excelent foundation."
3,Good on the eyes,"This must the easiest PHP text. The layout is simple, and allows to step thru each section very fast. There are enough examples, to explain how each function works. This book is a good read for those who need a fast and easy stepping thru to PHP. From there on you can buy more advanced books to build up on your knowledge and get your hands dirty."
3,Depends on what you want...,"If you are a beginner to programming languages this book is very good. If you are a proffesional this is a book that you would breeze through in a night, maybe two to get an overview of the language.The book is good for a beginner because you cannot get more detailed about the small topic chunks they covered at any given time. The books assumes you know nothing or virtually nothing of programming languages or server side scripting.The book is only a wet your lips kind of thing for a proffessional. It will not give you everything you need to really write good production sites. You need another book for that. Even though it only wets your lips, this book is a good book even for the proffesional because it is a very quick read for someone who knows other programming languages."
3,Interesting,"Not a bad show overall. Some interesting facts in it, also a lot of speculation - with that said, I still enjoyed every episode."
3,Nice Scrapbook,"The burgundy color looks very nice in this kind of leather. The whole assembly is sturdy and reliable, and the ring enclosures are easy to activate and disengage. Overall, this is the best scrapbook I've never used."
3,Predictable,I was surprised but basically this is a Cinderella story. Good read. Informative.Would recommend.
4,Excellent Read,"I normally do not have an interest in books of this era, however, a close friend suggested I try it. I just completed this work and it was excellent. It was totally different from Ms. Briscoe's other works, which I read. I am a native of Virginia and I found the historical information to be spellbounding. The characters were believable and they received my compassion and yes, sometimes anger at their actions. I thought she went from generation to generation smoothly without alot of cumbersome, insignificant information added. I was overjoyed at the end, especially to discover the author's relationship to the characters. I recommend this book to all fans of Connie Briscoe. You will be in for a treat."
1,NOT MS. BRISCOE'S BEST WORK!!,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED MS. BRISCOE'S BOOKS AMD EAGERLY ANTICIPATED THIS ONE BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED; SO MUCH SO THAT I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH IT. I JUST FOUND IT HARD TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE CHARACTERS DID NOT WANT THEIR FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY AND WANTED TO STAY PUT. I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE AUTHOR'S RESEARCH. NOT A BOOK THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND.
2,Very Disappointing!,"There was so much that could have been done with this novel! I was on the last few pages still hoping for a glimpse of a good story. Ms. Briscoe chose to jump around way too much in this story. I felt there was no focus at all. Whole books could have been written for each time period the chararcters experience; however, the author made a big mistake by trying to condense all of these stories into one. And the conclusion! I felt as if she were trying to write a half-hour after school television program instead of a full-length book."
4,Where is the rest of it?,"I enjoyed A Long Way From Home and it was a book that I couldn't put down because each chapter made you want to continue to the next. However, I was disappointed in some of the characters because you didn't know what happened to them. They just ""disappeared"" I wanted to know what happened to the father that ran off for his freedom. Nothing was ever said about him. There were too many gaps and too much time in between certain chapters. We left one chapter with a baby being born and the next chapter started with the baby being a young lady and another child also in the picture. I think the story should have talked more of how and when these other children were conceived. What happened during that time. It just seems to me that the book could have been connected in a better way as far as the time gaps. The story was great, but just should have been more informative. Too much was left to the imagination."
3,Bluesy prose stylings,"This is a very interesting book. Murray is an incredibly erudite scholar on blues and jazz traditions as well as both idioms' place in American culture. This novel is very much in the jazz/blues vein of investigation and exploration of different form; in this case, prose. At first I found his style somewhat disconcerting, but once into the book, I was completely drawn in by the perfect rendering of deep southern speech, the affecting characters and the deeply intriguing Luzana Cholly and other juke joint characters. Murray also writes movingly of the protaganist's (many say this book is semi-autobiographical)sexual awakening and discovery of a profound twist in his life."
5,Mighty Little Book,"This book is a must have for all Featherweight owners, if you don't already own the current edition or don't own it at all, by all means buy it. The book contains a wealth of information presented in an easy to read, well illustrated format. It is the only book I refer to when researching, using or maintaining my machines, I consider it the Featherweight Bible."
3,Good set just was not what i wanted.,"When i ordered this socket set i was concerned about the ""shallow broach"". I generally prefer a deep socket that is fluted the entire length of the socket. But i was willing to see just how shallow the broach was. When i received this GearWrench set i saw that it is very shallow indeed and would not work with how i planned on using the sockets. I would mainly use them on lug nuts and spark plugs. I want the socket to engage as much of the lug nut as possible to avoid any damage. So these would not work for me so i returned them. That is why they got 3 stars.The quality of this set and other gearwrench tools i own is top notch. I would have preferred to have this set over a Craftsman set as gearwrench generally has a tighter fit and smoother chrome. Just because it is made in Taiwan or china doesn't mean its junk! So if you want a shallow broach this is for you, if not don't buy it. i hope this helps anyone."
3,Not very good hydration,"I tried pca line based on spa recommendation, in general, I didn't like the 3 products (2 cream, 1 cleansing) I tried. I've normal skin w/ sensitive cheeks and oily t-zone.This one is light textured, but did not absorb easily. The next day, when I cleaned my face, the cream felt like a film coming off. I suspected that instead of being absorbed by the skin, it formed a film on the skin. Also, my face felt dry. I didn't finish using this product. Switched back to Shiseido's bioperformance Advanced super revitalizer that I normally used."
1,This figure is NOT OPTIMUS PRIME,"The advertised figure is NOT OPTIMUS PRIME... it's not even a transformers product! Do not be fooled, as this is FALSE ADVERTISING."
5,Real Liberals are ProLife,"With science, history, and logic, the authors call liberals (and libertarians) to be consistent in their stand for human rights. We cannot, on the one hand, oppose the killing of young people in an unjust war while demanding the right to kill unborn children in abortion. In the past, pro-lifers have been dismissed as blinded by their religious agenda - but which is worse, a religious agenda or a purely political agenda? This cry for justice must be heard. Abortion has not brought freedom to women, on the contrary, it has brought only another form of oppression. It is time to make a consistent moral stand for the most basic of all human rights."
2,Sarcasm can only go too far...,"Although I am a rabid FZ fan, this is one of those albums that I just can't get used too. It has slightly dated from when it was originally released for starters. We knew how much FZ hated Republicans, but considering that throughout the 1988 tour (and the 2 live albums released thereafter) the satire and sarcasm that was very amusing first time round, it had now become too venomous and full of scorn. The songs taking the p**s out of Jimmy Swaggart were funny for a while, but with every release of the '88 live material, it just became too much. All the scaborous lyric-based songs have the sort of mentality of someone repeating a joke to you thinking that you didn't hear it properly first time around (""did you get it? well I'll tell it again!""). We know FZ's hatred for the state of politics of that time (rightly so), but just a few songs would have been enough. Overall, it's a very depressing album. Not even vocalist Ike Willis can save it."
4,Excellent band and some of Frank's best political lyrics,"Of all the great bands Frank brought on the road with him during his career, his last touring band (from the 1988 tour) was by far the best. Of the three releases that chronicled that tour, Broadway the Hard Way is the one that focuses on almost all new songs. His political satire is sharper than ever. ""When The Lie's So Big"" is a general stab at Republicans; ""Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk"" gives Pat Robertson and the rest of the Radical Religious Right the finger; ""Any Kind of Pain"" chides Madison Avenue execs and their 'bimbo-ization"" of women; etc. etc. etc. The horn section really beefs up the tight arrangements. Long-time Zappa sidekick Ike Willis is present with his great voice and sense of humor. In other words...buy the album. Not my first choice for newbies, but shows Frank's best band playing some terrific music. And it's funny, too."
3,Typical 1988 Zappa...not necessarily a good thing,"I must join the dissenters, like Ryan. This album properly belongs on the lower ranks of the official Zappa discography. It's a suitable sampler of 1988 tour material, but that's rather the problem. The 1988 band was one of the slickest, most commercial-sounding of all Zappa's tour bands. The technical quality of the musicianship is high (legendarily so even), but you can tell that the presentation is a vulgarization of what we'd heard from Zappa and his collaborators in the 1960s and 1970s. The transitions between tunes don't come as fast, the humor is less generally antiauthoritarian and more specifically anti-PMRC/Reagan/Bush. Compare this album with, say,You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 2, (which was released contemporaneously but recorded back in 1974), and you can hear the difference between vintage live Zappa and reheated live Zappa."
4,classy musicianship,"this is the most recent performance of FZ i have in my collection, as he did release several after this came out in 1988 (he died from prostate cancer 5 years later. Does a splendid job of lacerating public figures in politics or religion (mostly rightwingers)."
5,One of franks best,With this ensemble of musicians you can pretty much play anything frank throws at you.The lyrics are a very biting satire of american politics.The musicianship of these guys is what really stands out.This could quite possibly be the best band ever to perform together.
4,Arkansas Confederates in the Western Theater,"Civil War research is often written from a soliders point of view or contains romantic idealism. This book simply states the events, describes the conditions, offers personal glimpses of the soilders, and provides a timeline of events. If you had an ancestor in the Western Theater, this book will provide information of what their world was like. I found soilder listings here that I have not seen anywhere else. This book has become a valuable source of information and I wish there were more like it."
3,There's an even better release out there...,"The two-fer reissue ""Ricky Sings Again/Songs by Ricky"" is significantly better than this CD, which features his first two LP's from 1957. The other disc offers his third and fourth albums, and the improvement in his vocals, in his band, in his choice of material are all evident. This one is not bad, of course. Rick's talent at age 17 was surprisingly high, but his first two records were mostly rockabilly covers and as good as Nelson was, he wasn't as good performing Jerry Lee Lewis songs as The Killer himself. So if you are nostalgic or a rock historian, I'd add ""Rick Sings Again"" ahead of his maiden LP and its sequel."
3,Dance pad,"The game over all is great, but downloading the game was confusing. After inserting the disk, the link came up with question marks (?). I had to change the destination from my D drive to my C drive. And also the up arrow on the pad does not work."
1,BORING,"After reading the one review I decided to rent this. The acting is soooo bad. At first I thought it was a joke and was waiting for the punchline.....nope it was one of the worst ""horror"" movies ever! It was like they were reading a script! It was awful! Actually I did't know that something like this would even make it to a retail shop! I stopped watching after about 15 minutes and a few days later decided to see if there was some kind of twist....nope...very, very boring, silly slasher twins!"
3,Not bad,"Not bad, and it's suitable for light reading, espeacially for kids, and it provides further insight on the characters of the book. My younger sister loves it."
4,An amazing piece of work--warts and all,"""Absolutely Free"" is one of those albums that grates on you in all the right ways. For this album Zappa added extra drum power with the addition of Billy Mundi, as well as the keyboard wizardry of Don Preston. The CD remix stays pretty true to the trusty vinyl mix.What is he singing about? Why are they playing those things? Why am I liking this? These are all questions that will go through your head on repeated listenings to ""Absolutely Free."" Essential listening!Small quibbles: ""Ritual...Pumpkin,"" essentially an eight-minute guitar solo, is possibly Zappa's worst guitar solo ever. Bunk Gardner's honking in the sax solo part isn't much better. By the time ""We're Only in it For the Money,"" his next album, was released, his chops had improved greatly.My favorite cut on the album is still ""America Drinks and Goes Home."" If you've ever played in a bar, you will instantly identify with this song!"
2,Absolute Garbage,"Thankfully this was not my first Zappa album or I may not have bought another. Zappa shows his disdain for the ignorant listening public with Absolutely Free which is only slightly better than Were Only In It For the money. If your a first time Zappa listener start with Zoot Allures. Live at the Fillmore East, Joe's Garage or Roxy and elsewhere. At least then you'll here some of the best R&R guitar soloing ever recorded. Freak Out was possibly the best debut album ever recorded but man did he ever go downhill, although briefly, from there. Even Sheik Yerbouti and Ruben and the Jets would be better choices."
4,Absolutely //// Under $20,"The Mothers of Invention/ Absolutely Free (the 15 tracks edition): This is one of those Zappa projects that you either Love or Hate. This is not the album I would start out with if I were trying to discover the music of Frank Zappa, but if you like Zappa, you will probably love this odd offering. However, even though I love the thing, I have to admit that it ain't a five star album."
5,Absolutely Indispensible,"I found the vinyl version over 20 years ago. This album still represents for me one of Zappa's absolute best. From begining to end it is flawless. It is especially meaningful to those my age (46) and a bit older who have strong memories of the time period. If you buy the CD version, play it without Big Leg Emma and Why Don'tcha Do Me Right (neither on the vinyl). While good songs, they just don't fit the homogeneous feel of the rest of the work.Put on the headphones and marvel at the quality of this mid-sixties excercise in studio wizardry. See if you can find the bit taken from Stravinsky's Rites of Spring. And for a true Zappaphile it is a treasure trove of ""continuity"" references. Get this album!!"
5,Thirty-seven minutes of non-stop silliness!,"This, along with the Cartoon Planet Band CD's, is one of the wackiest recordings I own. My favorites are, without any doubt, the ""Duke of Prunes"" trilogy, ""Call Any Vegetable"", and Brown Shoes Don't Make It!"" I don't think I should say too much more; I might give something away! :) It's just one big laugh riot!"
3,Small,"Order one size larger than you think you need. But you get what you pay for. For what you pay, its not a bad deal."
2,Disappointed,"We have tried several plastic sprayers, and they always break after a couple months due to all of the plastic parts. We thought this would be a good solution, even though we could have purchased several plastic ones for the price. At first, it worked well. It had a good spray pattern, and descent pressure. However, after about 10 refills, it started losing pressure at the top seal where it screws together. Fortunately, we bought a rebuild kit after learning our lesson the hard way with other sprayers. Unfortunately, the gasket they sent with the rebuild kit was the wrong thickness for this sprayer. It turns out the metal that screwed together was bending every time it was filled up. Shortly after that, the gasket in the pump that creates pressure failed, so we used the one out of the rebuild kit (this one was actually the correct size). Two fills later, that one went out, too. We have since thrown the unit away and went back to plastic ones. Very costly lesson learned."
4,Great Collection of Articles,Donna's done a nice job putting together this collection of her articles from season 3. I remember her from the different message boards and am a fan of her writing. I am very happy that she is finally writing books and think that she should continue doing this.Donna is a big fan of George Huff and her love for him really shines through in this book. Her farewell to George piece is very touching. I remember the night George was voted off very well. Donna really got it right with that article.I encourage anyone who is a fan of season 3 and George to buy this book. You will not be disappointed.
4,very recommendable book,"It is a very interesting and readable book. However, there're some incorrect quotes or sources. E.G. p.215 note 174, He cited one old (19 th century) book about Messalina. But as far as I know, her lesbianismus was not written in any classical texts. I couldn't find her same-sex passion either in Tacitus, Juvenalis, Suetonius or in Dion Cassios. The author himself should have read original Greek & Latin texts. Even I an ignorant Japanese did try to read them to find a written proof. And I hope some erudite persons will kindly teach me the authority of her sapphism."
5,Dynastep Pain Relief Orthotics,"I had a severe and painful problem with plantar fasciitis several years ago, and my podiatrist had recommended very expensive custom orthotics. On a whim, I tried the Dr. Scholl's Dynastep inserts and, within a week, my problem disappeared completely. Haven't returned to the podiatrist since, and I use the inserts in every pair of shoes I own, including my New Balance Cross Trainers that already have a significant arch support. The Dynastep Inserts are WONDERFUL!"
5,Great songs for kids to sing along with,"WE have several of Johnette Downing's CDs for our grandkids. Very lively tunes, great voice, when they are visiting they want to listed to them over and over."
2,Not a favorite,"This could have been much better. The premise was interesting, with having the former fiance being the trustee. What ruined the story for me was what Alasdair lied about that caused Emma to leave him at the altar. The novel makes it out that she was irrational for doing so, when what he lied about was inexcusable.I don't require that the hero and heroine of a romance novel be perfect. In fact I prefer them to have some flaws. However they must be likable. Alasdair was not honorable or redeemable, and the ruined what could have been an interesting story."
2,Not one of Jane Feather's Best!,"Although I generally really like Jane Feather's books this one was somewhat of a disappointment. When Lady Emma's brother dies he leaves her in the care of Lord Alasdair, her former fiance, whom she left at the altar because he betrayed her. I found Alasdair a hero difficult to relate to, I'd have left him at the altar too!"
2,Very Predictable with a slow start,"At first this promises to be an enjoyable read, but unfortunately the story quickly bogs down. This tale is full of all the requisite misunderstandings and predictable villainous third parties. Quite a disappointment. Jane Feather is capable of much more entertaining work!"
5,Very nice,These are very nice wing nuts. They have a very nice chrome finish and look great. If you are in need of wing nuts in this size these are a great choice.
3,Very clever - but almost no soul,"This is not going to be to everybodys taste. Certainly the vast majority of Jazz fans will NOT like this. Its also likely that a lot of Zappa fans will not like it either.This is music produced on a synclavier, an early computer musical instrument. Musically very complicated, with Zappa playing quarter tones and complicated rhythms. Repeated listens will reveal some marvellous moments particularly on the St. Etienne which has a great guitar solo. This is the one track that does have some soul. However the rest did leave me feeling a bit cold.So overall this is really a curates egg of an album, that some may like and as the title suggests others may hate!"

This is the one track that does have some soul. However the rest did leave me feeling a bit cold.So overall this is really a curates egg of an album, that some may like and as the title suggests others may hate!"
5,It is supposed to be sterile,"This record was composed specifically for the synclavier, and it's supposed to be exactlly how it is. No groove, no dynamics, sterile...The machine has no feelings, never rests and has, well, no guts...We have never heard pieces from Mozart the way he wanted them to sound... he just printed on paper what he interpreted as a guide to play his pieces... but we have Frank's work and it sounds exactlly how he wanted them to sound.Don't argue with FZ. He was and still is above all of us...FZ Lives!"
5,"Brilliant! ""...Tornado"" is beyond anything ever recorded!","That's right! This album has the greatest piece of music I've ever heard! Perhaps the most complex, too, but not for the sake of being complex. Extremely adventuresome and avant but, with the exception of the guitar solo cut (""St. Etienne""), each track is structured and produced without improvisation. With original sounds (sound effects) combined with flawless production and perfect execution, Frank here invented a new music genre that is unique only to this recording. On ""St. Etienne"", he proves himself to be the most inventive Rock guitarist and my favorite, ever. ""Jazz From Hell"" is heaven!"
1,Yuck.,"""Zappa with a Casio keyboard!"" was the horrible thought I couldn't shake while listening to this egregious experiment in self-indulgence. Zappa without a band is soulless, heartless, pointless, and annoying.No lyrics. Phony-sounding programmed drums. Only one guitar solo (on the last track). It's generally awful. Zappa's compositions, contrary to popular belief, are ugly and tasteless--they typically run through a strange succession of time signature and key changes, then end, without much thought to sophisticated melodies (in stark contrast to some of Sting's better work, e.g. the tune Seven Days). Zappa's work is acceptable when the music is played by a band, because the audience can marvel at the fact that the band can actually play the complex stuff. But when his music is programmed, it loses its virtuoso magnetism. Again, it literally sounds like a first-year Berklee student with a Casio keyboard.Buy Joe's Garage or Tinseltown Rebellion."
3,Skool,"Just wondering if any of the cretins who wrote the reviews below ever got their high school diplomas - they should ask for a refund, cuz they sure can't use the English language. As for Frank, I miss him dearly."
5,Character driven fiction at its finest,"A wonderful novel with richly drawn characters. Set in Montana in the 1950's, it could be about any time in any place. It speaks to the expectations of youth--about life and marriage--and how the unfolding of it all is much more complex than we could ever have imagined when we were young. Written with great honesty and clarity, it is a thoroughly enjoyable book."
1,No big deal,The game on pogo on the internet is better. If you don't play it for a little while you have problems with the disc.
5,Mighty Mouse RULES at Acoustic Paradise Independant Radio !,"I first heard ""Mighty Mouse"" on "" paltalk.com ""...My child said ""are you gonna put that on your radio station mommy ?"" I said ""you bet-cha !"" I'm so impressed with this arrangementthat I plan to feature it on my online station which will beginairing on New Years day 2004.It will be the first song to ever be played on my station -and will be played regularly ! Tune in to(http://www.live365.com/stations/306392?play) to hear this- and other great amazon.com artists! ""Kids Pow Wow Songs"" is a MUST HAVE in your CD collection ! Three Thumbs Up !!!Jada Greenway -radio promoter/DJ"
2,surprised,"I saw this band live at the New Orleans Jazz Festival and they had a great performance. I purchased this CD on-line and thought I would hear more good music. I was wrong. The American TV icons injected into their songs (e.g. Mighty Mouse, Flinstones) seemed almost blasphamous to the proud rich heritage of Indian music. I might have simply missed the groups artistic intention. I'm returning this CD and will buy Tribute to the Elders."
5,for the Kids in all of us,"My granddaughter knows all the words to some of the more popular kid's powwow songs now. She loves the CD and so does ""grandmommy""."
4,My favorite cookbook,"I love reading this as well as cooking all the tasty recipes. So far everything I have cooked has been really good. I especially loved the salmon and corn chowder (although I added more salmon than the recipe called for). When I cook with recipes from this book I like knowing that my body is thanking me for the nutritious food!The reason I gave 4 stars is that a couple of the recipes call for dried blueberries (like the blueberry and wild rice pilaf). All the dried blueberries I could find in stores had high fructose corn syrup listed as an ingredient, and this is one of the worst kinds things for your body. Maybe the author can find unsweetened dried blueberries?"
3,Informative,"12 Best Foods Cookbook is informative. Dana Jacobi easily explains why these healthy ingredients are in fact good for you. The ingredients aren't overly expensive, are easy to find in stores and didn't require I purchase any new kitchen equipment. My cooking skills are far from Master Chef zone and yet I found nothing in the book to be overly complicated or scary. I appreciate the recipes but my kids (age 13 and 4) were not impressed by the majority of the dishes I've tried so far."
3,Average is the word,"I have a lot of health type cookbooks and this is one I am glad I bought, but it isn't really anything amazing. Because of that I have only ended up using it a few times."
1,Not good for normal people!,These recipes often call for ingrediates I've never heard of and have no idea where I would find them. Contrary to the borring cover the inside design is very pleasing but it becomes frusterating to not be able to make half the recipes.
1,Does this guy ever get to the point?,"This was one of the most drawn out books I have ever read. Like ""Curfew"" this book held great promise, but just didn't deliver the goods for me. A good writer, but the author has a major problem focusing on the main plot."
5,The voice of the novelist,"Get to know ""Gabo"" through his own words as he converses with his old friend Plinio. I found ""El Olor de la Guayaba"" beneficial in helping me understand the author's view of his own books, including the popular and Nobel Prize-winning ""Cien Años de Soledad""/""One Hundred Years of Solitude."" García Márquez explains how this novel is thoroughly based in Caribbean reality, not ""magic."" In addition, ""El Olor de la Guayaba"" provides valuable and interesting biographical and personal information, plus some great photos. García Márquez is a brilliant, witty, and humanistic soul, and this little book fully shows off his character."
3,Moshav Band - 'The Best Of:Higher And Higher' (JMG/Jewish Music Group),"As for Isreali bands,this is only the second one I've ever listened to a release from.Members were apparently bought up on and heavily influenced by both traditional music and classic rock such as Santana,Van Morrison,Dylan and Neil Young.Some just might tag this as 'jam rock'.Tunes here I found somewhat to my liking were ""Come Back"",the uptempo ""Waiting For The Calling"",the singer songwriter-like ""Don't Give Up"",the James Taylor-ish ""The Things You Can't Afford"",""Stop"" and ""If Someone Falls In Love With Me"".Line-up:Dovid-guitar&vocals,Yosef-bass,Meir-guitar&mandolin and Yehuda-percussion&vocals.Give it a shot."
4,Very fun to listen to!,"I first heard ""Higher and Higher"" at a local synagogue playing over the PA system while waiting for a Purim play to begin. I had to ask the young man operating our sound board who it was, and I ordered it from Amazon not long after. The music on this album is tons of fun, with devotional aspects present (but not more important to the feel of the music) than real life human happiness -- in fact, it is very refreshing to sense that the two don't need to be separated while enjoying the sounds. Like any music, you have to listen to this CD 2-3 times before it gets into you. My children (ages 3, 3, and 9) absolutely LOVE to dance around to ""Shabbis Kodesh"" for its simple joyfulness as it reminds them of the ""Aye yi yi"" type songs we sometimes enjoy during worship as a family."
3,Good but horribly expensive here,"My woodpeckers love it. We have a male and female downy pecker. This is good stuff and well made and thought out. BUT, gosh it is $$$$$. Walmart has it for about $1.47. Amazon price for one is over $8.00. Whew!!!!"
2,Not like the other Mentos,I ordered these because every other flavor of Mentos is dye-free and my daughter is allergic to every artificial food color so Mentos are one of the few candies she can have. Of course in the product description no ingredients are listed for this product. These have artificial food colors unlike the other Mentos products and a horrible after-taste.
4,A Virtual Quotation Book of George Gilder!,"To the pure George Gilder fan I'm sure this is a 5 star. My slight downgrade is because I come the investor's side of what George Gilder has to say. While this book is only 2 years old, it's value as an investment book has been decreased by time. I would have liked a little more on Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Scott McNealey, Steve Jobs and all the characters who are the cutting-edge of the high-tech business. Since George Gilder did not write this book or even add a comment to the Introduction, he can't be blamed in any way. The editor's choice of material is spread a little longer and thinner than I'd like. Maybe 4 1/2 stars is a better all-around rating, but for the investor only a 4 I'm sorry to say. Things just happen too fast."
2,The water stop feature seems defective,I really had high hopes for the Claber line of products based on what I've read from other reviewers. I have no qualms with their spray nozzle. But I have a major complaint with their quick connect valve assemblies. The water stop mechanism works so well that even when I connect the spray nozzle onto these quick connect valve no water comes out of the spray. Tried as hard as I might I cannot get this thing to work! I took out the inner valve to figure out what went wrong...now I can't seem to put the mechanism back again. I called their company and the best they could do was try to sent me a replacement quick connect. Well it took several calls and more than a month later quick connect came in the mail .... but it wasn't the right one! I give up! No more Claber products for me :(
4,Great. Love it.,"I just bought this yesterday, it's great. I had a Bodum Curl for 3 years before this one & I waited a year to replace...why? I have no idea...I missed all the uses for it...I do not like using my microwave oven except for reheating food because I don't like the microwave stories. This Aroma works quick but I have to say it is loud. I just got it so I will update my review in a few months. Great for the price & water has no..no..no after taste. Yay.Update 2.10.10Still love my Aroma Water Kettle. No problems, we use it daily at least 2 times sometimes more. The exterior does get water spots on them, I have removed them w/a little natural degreaser on a paper towel then I go over it w/a water wet paper towel...dry w/a lint free towel...looks new again. love it. xxoox."
2,"Hm, not quite as promised.",Although it looks nice and the water heats quickly - the switch that's supposed to flip once the water boiling doesn't work consistently. I will have to follow this up with the manufacturers. :o(
1,Chinese made junk,"I liked the design and simplicity. I liked that it had a decent rating and was reasonably priced. I just need something to boil water. Simple right? Well this thing would not stop boiling. Would not turn off, ever. I sent it back for a replacement. So I got a replacement from Amazon. Can't complain about the service. The second version of the pot would not boil. The little lever that turns the thing on would not stay on. Kept turning off before the water could heat. Amazon said they would replace or refund, but I called the manufacturer to see what they had to say. They were pleasant and the young lady at the other end said that they would send me a replacement, one made in a different factory (they could tell by the serial number). They said the Amazon used products made in a particular factory in China where there were problems. I don't know where the third machine came from but it is working as it should. For how long, I don't know. Maybe the third time is a charm."
1,Automatic shutoff does not work and leaks occur,"We had high hopes for this kettle base on reviews, but the one we purchased leaked water out of the switch at the base of the kettle. Furthermore, the kettle would never, and I mean never, automatically shutoff. We played with suggestion from other reviews such as making sure the lid was closed tight and that the screen was in place, but nothing worked. Thanks so Amazon for an easy return."
2,Works but with some flaws,"I bought this item in March 2010. It boils water, fairly fast, and it does shut itself off eventually. In that it does as expected. As other reviewers have noted, however, this design has some flaws in it.* The outside, made of metal, gets pretty hot; there does not seem to be adequate insulation.* It keeps boiling for a full minute or more after reaching boiling point. This just seems wasteful of electricity. I don't know if I got one with a faulty thermometer, or if they are designed this way on purpose.There might be other models out there which are better designed."
5,just PERFECT for baby water ready,"Excellent! I loved it, I am a mother of a 6 months old, and this is what I use to boil and warm the water for her bottles, it is also great for coffes and teas, best buy on Amazon this year, it is also very good looking."
1,Poorly made,Looks great but the on/off switch broke after a few months of use. I can't return it on Amazon because it's past the return window.
4,Aroma review,"The Aroma water kettle is great, boil water quite fast and turns off when it is done. I give it 4 star, because it is not the fastest water kettle, i had another one by a different brand, that water kettle boils water faster with same volume of water by 20 secs. Otherwise this is a great product."
3,"okay, but not how it should be","The kettle looks good and it matches my other stainless steel appliances. Before I bought it, I read the other reviews and I saw that several people had complained about the automatic shut-off doesn't work. I thought I might get lucky and get one that works. Well, I DID NOT! Mine also doesn't shut off, it keeps running and running.... I am afraid to leave the kitchen while it is turned on, in case I forget and set the house on fire! This is not how it should be. I am thinking about sending it back, but what a hassle! And what if I get another broken one as exchange?Go look for another one and hope for a better result."
1,So much for inexpensive kettle,After five weeks of use the unit auto off is failing. Wont disconnect even if so hot that the handle will burn your hand. It is an invitation to fire.
4,Great kettle,"I got this kettle to replace my 90-year-old dad's dangerous Rival Hot Pot. So far, it's been terrific. Heats water quick as a wink, has a convenient water level window, is a good size (not too small, not too big), the interior is stainless steel, and I love the design. Why not five stars? The opening is just a tad too small to be completely convenient for filling or cleaning. But that's a minor concern. Overall, I'm so taken with it, I'm tempted to get one for myself! (Oh, yeah, Dad likes it, too!)"
1,It might last 6 months,"Won't automatically shut off, rust and leaking after 6 months of light use. Even it still has warranty, not worth the hazard to try again. It's going to the trash."
3,Bottom liner flaked off after 2 years - otherwise great,"I bought this kettle 2 years ago and liked it so well, I bought another for my winter home in Florida. After 2 years, the bottom of the kettle appears to have flaked into chips like paint chips. This was not noticed until we found chips at the bottom of an empty cup, then searched for the source. There were enough chips with a dark side and lighter side that it appears the interior bottom of the kettle was lined or painted with a coating that has now flaked off. We don't know what we have been ingesting, but are worried the same problem will happen with the newer kettle purchased last winter."
1,Does not shut off once boiling. Fire hazard.,"Title pretty much says it all. The water kettle does not shut off once the water starts boiling; I must manually switch it off. Not only it this an inconvenience in that I can't set it and forget it, it's a huge safety/fire hazard if I were to accidentally let it boil until dry. This is unfortunate, because it is otherwise an excellent product."
3,"nice, but a little malfunction","I love this kettle but anfortunately two weeks into using it the automatic switch off does not work once the water has come to a full rolling boil. other than that i like it very much, except now i have to be by the machine so i can manually take it off the base as it won't switch off automatically anymore."
5,Best Little Tea Kettle,"I am thrilled with this item. No more tea kettles overboiling or whistles not working. I just fill it up and push the lever. Hot water is ready in a jif and the grandgirls and I can have steaming hot tea in no time at all. Nice thing is it shuts off on its own, but I do unplug it when not in use. The pot is attractive, durable and works perfectly. Highly recommended!"
4,Solid purchase,"Hot water for: tea, the french press, and cooking. These were the uses I agonizingly searched and researched for a cordless electric kettle. This one meets all my needs functionally, aesthetically and financially! Very satisfied with my choice.Full disclosure: I was sorely tempted by the Saeco kettle that changes color and offers temperature settings. However, after some deep soul searching realized that for me, tea-making just isn't all that serious. ;) I say go for it and enjoy."
4,"A little noisy, but great otherwise!","I really like this electric kettle and a great value. It is a little noisier than other kettles, but can boil 1.5L of water in about 3 minutes."
1,Broke after 6-months,"Worked fine until 6-months old and then the automatic shutoff failed. So it would boil out all the water. This is a FIRE HAZARD. Do not purchase this item.Amazon won't honor any return on this item either, so you're out-of-luck."
4,sharp looking,This kettel is very sharp looking.Its quick to boil. The only down side is that itdoes not always shut itself off when it comes to boiling point.
1,Dangerous,"Ours has a flaw in which the pot does not turnoff once the water starts to boil, even after 10 min. Could start a fire if you are not careful. Ours is going back."
2,Not the right one!,Look carefully as there are a few cordless kettles.THIS MODEL HAS A PROBLEM with the lid/cover not being quite tight enough. This causes steam and excess time to reach boiling!Cannot be used under a cabinet because of the design flaw!
3,A-OK,"The one I got leaked at the bottom of the handle, so I returned it for a new one. I've had the replacement for a few months now and it works just fine. There's nothing special to say about this kettle, it's relatively cheap and it works."
2,not happy,"Bought this brand after previous kettle brand failed too quickly. In the past have used a kettle all day long, every day. Well, this Aroma kettle began leaking after about 3 months, too late to return. Eventually am finding corrosion marks all around the base. With a circle of water around the kettle after heating cycle, am not happy with the contact clean up. Not sure it is safe. Am expecting the element will wear out prematurely. Separately, with the narrow opening, it is hard to clean. Not a good choice for me."
4,Energy saving option,The Aroma was purchased for the automatic shut off but the feature I like the most is the quick response time. Definitely something I will buy for gifts!
5,So Great I Bought Another!,"I bought this for the office to make hot water for hot cocoa, tea and oatmeal. It boils the water very fast! It is also quite attractive - enough so that we can leave it out on the counter.I love it so much that I just ordered another for my home for making tea and french press coffee!"
5,Good Kettle,"I use a kettle regularly about 3-4 times per day. I really like these ones that sit on a base but in my experience it is the contact in the base that goes bad before anything else. This kettle replaces a plastic T Fal I had for about 5 years. It works just great, and I enjoy the kind of retro chic look of it. Some reviewers complained that it gets hot when the water boils and if your only experience has been with plastic, I guess it does. But most of the kettles I have had, apart from the T Fal were metal so I sort of expect them to get hot. I was not concerned about boiling water in plastic until I started to read reviews when my last kettle went bad, but I think I would have bought this kettle regardless because of the good reviews and the way it looks. I have had it for a bout 6 weeks now and am very happy with it."
3,"Attractive, Well Made & Slow","I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this kettle for my office. I've had a Utilitea at home for years which I love, but it's smallish and the plastic lid doesn't really open enough. I was afraid it wouldn't hold up to heavier, less careful use than I'm giving it at home. The Aroma is a perfect size for a large pot of tea, the lid opens fully, it's well made and has a nice high stainless steel polish. The only con is that it takes at least 6 minutes to boil two cups off cold water---something the Utilitea does in about half that time."
5,COULD BE A LIFE SAVER,"This kettle could be a life saver.An elderly parent was having trouble remembering to turn off her stove when boiling water.Old habits at age 90 are hard to break and burning pots and blaring smoke alarms had red danger flags waving.This little kettle solved the problem. It works as advertised. it's safe, very simple to use and mama loves it.That's all that matters."
2,Auto-off does not work,"This kettle will not automatically shut off when the water is boiling, and there is a leak under the switch."
5,Great kettle,"If you need hot water in a hurry, ths is great. I use it for full immersion coffee and I have no complaints. It will heat a quart of water quicker than I can in a saucepan on the stove and much quicker and in the mocrowave. It will shut off automatically when the water boils."
3,Leaks!,"Heats water perfectly and we love that it is steel, but as many others mentioned, it leaks from the bottom. We just empty it out after each use to avoid the problem."
5,Very pleased,"I bought this little Aroma a month ago and am very happy with its performance so far. It's lightweight ( I move it around alot), heats water so quickly, and doesn't take up much counter space. I'm thinking of buying one for my Mother too."
2,Electric Kettle,I am using the kettle. The first I purchased failed shutting automatically a few days after purchase. Amazon exchanged it and this one works better but I would not purchase it again. It lets the water boil way too long before it shuts off.
3,boiling too long,"The kettle looks good, has a good capacity, but it shuts off only after a minute or two of boiling - that's a big disappointment for me."
1,cheaply made and disappointing,"I'd been looking for a new kettle for some time, and had been disappointed with each one I had purchased. This one looked as though it would be different, but when I opened the box, and saw it in person, it was just as cheaply made as the others I'd previously bought. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, given the low price. I ended up returning it, and getting a whistling (stove top) Kitchenaid kettle, which I'm very happy with. It looks good, is well-made, and will save me money by not eating up loads of electricity!"
4,simple and works,"I like that it's incredibly easy to use, and it doesn't stand out too much. The only drawback is that it only holds 1.5 liters, which means i have to keep refilling it when I have guests over.However, simply put, it is very fast in boiling water, and material is pretty durable and it is easy to handle."
4,No more burnt plastic!!,"I love this kettle, it's great! It even has a little detachable filter to go over the spout so you can brew tea right in the kettle if you want. Mine did come with a little hole in the filter, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference. The shape does make it a little hard to clean if you do decide to brew in it, but it isn't that bad...I just hate doing dishes! Also, I wish it made a sound when it's done because I always seem to forget about it. All in all, I'm more than pleased...it's a great value!"
5,Works Great!,This tea kettle works fast and keeps water hot. I had one at my office and just bought one for my home because I like it so much.
4,Good Value!,"Definitely a good value for the money. I like the tall compact design for keeping on the counter. I use it every day. I've had it a few weeks and it works great. Water is hot and tastes normal. My only quibble is the on/off switch seems a little on the flimsy side and I wonder how long this will hold up. I saw some other reviews that had some issues with this. I had my old electric kettle for 10yrs+, and I'm not convince how long this will last, but if I get a few years then it is well worth it at this price."
5,Quite good,THe kettle is the second one I have bought since last year. One in my office and working quite well.
4,"a bit hard to see the water level, and the lid bottom is plastic.","The bottom of the lid is made from plastic. While this plastic, when hot, doesn't smell too much, you still can feel some odour of hot plastic if you open the lead. But you don't feel anything in your tea.The water level meter is behind the hand, so it is a bit hard (albeit possible) to see it. The digits and marks are small and bleak, which also does not help.I give it 4 points only because if it is inexpensive."
4,Does what it is supposed to,This water kettle does exactly what it is supposed to: boils water. I have had mine for a year and it seams to work flawless which is a big plus for any machine. The only drawback that I can find is that it will boil for a little longer than needed/expected before it automatically shuts down. The light indicator is helpful to know if it is turned on properly and the 1 1/2 litter capacity (0.4 gallons) is enough for most applications. Overall very pleased although I would not call it the most X-press there is.
5,"excellent form and function, great value for this price!","One of the lower priced kettles that I looked at. I eventually decided to go with it because of the solid reviews. I've been very pleased.The metal doesn't look cheap, the handle is very comfortable, it heats up much quicker than I thought it would, and it retains heat even while powered off for quite some time.Great product!!"
5,hot water kettle heats fast!,I love this thing. Got one after traveling in N. Zealand where they use this kind of thing all the time. I just throw in 16 oz of water and literally in 2 minutes it is boiling. 1500 watts is the ticket!Couldn't recommend it more higly. Shuts itself off if you forget it too which is a great feature.
3,Good for a Year,"I really like the fact that this is a stainless steel kettle. Nice cordless design. Lasted about a year and now I get an intermittent red light as water approaches boiling. This of course means that the water almost comes to a boil then the heating element shuts down, only to come back on as the water cools. I will probably buy another unit because of the design and low cost, but it would have been nice if it lasted a little longer."
4,Good Electric Kettle,"Pros:- Boils water fairly quickly- Looks are appealing- The kettle comes off the base, so no wires while pouring.Cons:- Like all cheap stuff made in another countries - pretty cheaply made.- The handle to open the lid looks like it will break soon...Update 2/16/2010The handle on the lid is still attached to it :-)"
3,it leaks from the bottom,"i really wanted to like this product, it heats up water quickly and looks sleek on my kitchen counter, but it leaks from the bottom meaning there is a pool of water i have to wipe up if i leave any excess water in the kettle..."
4,Great product under $30!,"I mainly use this at work, I see most people use the microwave but I prefer not too. At home we have a electric Thermo Pot but did not want to spend a lot of money for work use. The convenience of having hot water at your desk is very nice since I like to drink hot tea and eat oatmeal in the morning. The product is attractive and works well. The auto shutoff is a nice feature. Heats water to a boil in a short period, you will definitely hear the boiling sound. A good product to have around."
5,like magic,"boils water like magic. great for french press coffee, instant oatmeal, tea, instant noodle soups, etc. so fast! looks good and well made."
4,"So far, so good",I have had this product for about 6 weeks and it seems to perform well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have reservations about the flimsy little tab that you press to turn it on. Just wondering if it will stand the test of time. The tab for on/off seems like an odd choice of design for the product instead of a regular on/off button.
2,Broken in less than 6 months,"Loved the kettle and used it nearly every day, however suddenly water gushed out from the bottom and all over my counter top. Now I must go through the trouble to figure out how to have it replaced. In fact, I liked this kettle so much in the beginning, I purchased one for our office...which who knows if it will last much longer, too."
1,mind of its own,"Received this as a Christmas gift and as big tea drinkers we were looking forward to the ease of use and speed as promised. Instead we have a device with a mind of its own and for no apparent reason shuts off early, mid way or several times through the boiling cycle. We've read the manual, dried the base and kettle each time, ensured it was on a level sturdy surface and still we have the kettle shut off randomly at various stages in the boiling process - very frustrating.Would never recomend this Aroma Kettle to anyone and only wish we had returned it right away instead of giving it more time for us to figure out the issue."
2,Only last a year and 4 months,My pot didn't work today after not even a year and half. The metal isn't that good a quality and gets funny around the openings.
1,Kaput Kettle,Kettle was a disappointment for us. We bought it and were thrilled with it at first. Nice action on the depressing lever and handsome chrome. But it started leaking from we know not where. And then it stopped heating the water entirely after just four months of use. Of course the return window has now closed so we're outta luck. I'd avoid this model.
1,"Leaks, rusts?","I thought I was safe with a product with four stars and over a thousand reviews, but should've paid more attention to negative reviews. Like others, my kettle has started leaking and upon close inspection has 'rusty' spots along the bottom where the stainless steel meets the black plastic. I'm not sure if mine shuts off automatically or not either because I usually flip it off myself (usually like my water not quite boiling). Alas, threw away packaging."
1,Kettle leaks and does not turn off automatically.,"I have had the kettle for about a month. Like others who have reviewed this product, I also have found that it does not always turn off when the water reaches boiling, so you cannot leave it unattended.I also have noticed in the past week that it has started leaking. The water is coming out near the switch. If you hold the kettle up, I can see it slowly dripping out of that location.With these problems, I do not recommend this product.I subsequently purchased the Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle and found it to be a much more reliable product. The Aroma has been sent to my local electronics recycler."
1,Bad Taste,"We needed a new hot water kettle and found the Aroma on sale. The style was perfect and performance was good, however it gave the water a terrible taste and smell, similar to boiled plastic. I followed the directions for cleaning prior to use, however after 5 full boiling cycles with fresh water each time and 2 cups of wasted coffee I gave up and returned it."
2,Dead after 6 months,"It has been a perfect electric kettle for 6 months (water boils quickly, nice design, suitable volume, visible level of water, automatic shut off), but this is over - it stopped working! Normally an electric kettle serves for 2-3 years. It is frustrating - this is 2nd kettle from Amazon in 1 year!"
5,Great Deal,I have been using this kettle for at least 6 months now and have not had any problems with it. It is really convenient and water heats up a lot quicker than if I used the stove. It is a lot less annoying than having to deal with a whistling tea kettle or a cup that is too hot to handle from the microwave. I love that it automatically turns off and does not make a lot of noise. It is very stable and would be difficult to tip over. The sale price is very reasonable. I think this is safer to use than a tea kettle that would be placed on the stove.I wish I had thought to get something like this years ago.
1,Won't Shut OFF,"I purchased one and it's auto shut off didn't work, needless to say it boiled dry. I purchased a second one and it worked for a couple of weeks. Then once again it wouldn't shut off....I'm two for two......Went to Costco and bought a different one, at least it's easier to take this one back if it doesn't work right."
1,auto shut off doesn't work,"The reviews looked great yet after the first kettle arrived with the auto shut off feature not working, I tried one more time and ordered a replacement. The second one has the same problem, no auto shut off. The kettle will boil and rock like crazy if you don't turn it off. It steams up the cabinets while it boils away... I would go for another brand if the shut off feature is important to you."
1,2 out of 2 leaked Immediately. Amazon's returns are amazing,"This is the 1st product that I have every had to return to Amazon. Upon receiving the Aroma Water Kettle, I filled it up and did a 1st run through test. After the kettle was to a full boil I started to make some tea. I lifted up the kettle and found a pool of water under the cordless base. I dried everything off and tried again hoping that I had spilled the water somehow. I refilled the kettle carefully and let it sit for 30 minutes. Results were the same, big puddle on and under the base.I then requested a replacement, as there are always bad eggs with any product. Willing to forget this 1st bad experience, I tested the new pot. SAME result, instantly leaked all over the counter.So 2 for 2 leaking pots. Perhaps it was just a bad batch... The packaging was in good order when received, so I doubt it happed in shipping. To Amazon's credit, the return process was painless. They even shipped the 2nd kettle with 2 day shipping!"
1,"Old ones of this are great, newer ones leak, quality has gone way down","So, I wanted to get a replacement of this. My first one I got four years ago works great, it is in great shape, so I wanted to get one I could use at work.Second one I bought, leaked from where the plastic and metal meet at the bottom of the kettle. Got a refund. Thought it was a fluke.Third one I bought, IT LEAKS TOO, except it is in an even worse spot, from under the handle, right above the button, so water can potentially leak through the opening around the lever.Stay away unless you want a lot of hassle, one time is a fluke, two times in a row is a trend."
1,returned it the next day,"maybe it was just a lemon, but the auto shut-off did not work from the moment I took it out of the box. Plus, there is not a ""keep hot"" feature. Although it did not promise that on the description, many of these electric kettles do indeed have ""stay hot"" features and I mistakenly assumed this one did also. You can buy the Oster electric kettle -- also from Amazon -- at roughly the same price, it works, and it has a ""stay hot"" feature which will keep the water hot for up to 12 hours."
5,PERFECT AND LOOKS AS NICE AS THE PHOTOGRAPH,"Just thought I'd add my .02 cents worth to the many reviews. I bought this for making fast cups of tea. I really like the interior as you don't see an element. Works like a charm but it is slightly heavier than the plastic ones I've seen in the U.K. It's worth it because the interior is so nice with no element showing and you're not ingesting plastic molecules. The base is nice and sturdy and nothing feels cheap about this unit at all. It looks really nice on any counter top. Not as fast as the ones that run on 240 volts in the U.K., but still pretty speedy. I use distilled water, Scottish Blend Brand Tea, organic milk and Sugar-In-The-Raw for an outstanding cup o' tea. I think I'll go make one right now. Cheers!"
4,Nice looking,"I am impressed with the looks of this kettle and will be proud to serve with it. I don't know how sensitive it is, but there are several warnings about not getting water on the base which I hope won't be a problem when I pour with it. It took aboiut six minutes to heat a pot of water which was a little longer than I thought it would be."
2,Leaked,The pot looks nice and heated water quickly but after only a couple of uses it started leaking around the bottom.Amazon was wonderful in taking the unit back though and refunding my money
3,noisy and quality cheaper than hoped,I purchased this as a gift after receiving one (different company) for myself that I love. This product was noisy and cheaply made. I was a bit embarrassed to hear it and see it on the counter of the person I had it shipped to as a gift. Wishing I had spent a little more and gotten a better made product.
2,"Leaky, cheap and poorly thought out","If left full water leaks out of seams on the bottom and pools around the base. Fill indicator is located behind handle and difficult to see, especially when holding the handle (when filling it, for instance). Markings on fill indicator have worn off less than one year after purchase (again, indicator is behind handle). I HIGHLY recommend buying a more expensive but higher quality unit."
4,Nice Kettle,I bought this kettle for my daughter as a gift and she told me she uses it every day. I have similar kettle and I use mine for everything from tea to heating water for oatmeal or hot chocolate.So much quicker then a tea pot on a stove top! Now that I've had one I wouldn't want to be without! I had it delivered directly to my daughter and she received it quickly and in good condition.
2,Bigger than it looks,"This has some crude finishes, the cap is sticky and the whole thing is bigger than it looks. I returned the product."
1,blows our electricity,"After a couple of uses, the kettle blew our electricity from outlet and nearby outlets on same line. We got power on again and the same thing happens. Otherwise, it works OK but is rather noisy. I've used coffeemakers, toaster ovens, food processors, blenders, mixers, etc. at same site and had no problem. It's not worth it to have our electrical system upgraded for this one appliance."
3,Worked great for a while.,"I've had this kettle for about 2 years. The price was good and it's worked great. But now, it makes me worry, because the auto-shut-off doesn't always work. Sometimes, not always, it just keeps boiling and boiling and I return to find the cord hot and the plug almost melting. I think I'm going to throw it away, I had a really expensive Cuisinart kettle that went on fire when the auto-shut off stopped working. Ya know, they can put a man on the moon, but they can't invent an auto-shut off kettle that works all the time!!"
3,Fast but you need to watch it,"This kettle is very fast in terms of bringing a teapot volume of water to boiling in less than five minutes. The reason for the lower rating is that that auto shut off does not work and there is a good possibility that the kettle I have purchased could boil dry if I did not watch it. This would certainly be of concern in a busy household or if purchased for someone who is absent minded about these kind of things. This may only be associated with this one kettle, but I would make sure to observe any purchased kettle at the beginning if this is a concern."
5,Handy Dandy,"We purchased this kettle more than 2 years ago and used it every day at least once. We also found it VERY useful when trying to warm up water quickly for pastas, similar to other comments. This morning was its last functioning day...bummer. I can't complain because we sure got great use from it. I was wondering if there was anything better on the market, but haven't seen anything for this price range with the same capability. Thus, I'll be purchasing another one this weekend. I highly recommend this water kettle...especially if you want hot or warm water that holds temperature for a while (encourage you to stay away from plastic water kettles). Enjoy!"
4,"Aroma electric tea kettle-leaks through slits in bottom, slowly.","It is annoying (and maybe an electrocution issue)to have to mop up the leaking water as it collects under the heating mat. (It leaks no more than 1/8-1/4 cup, then stops.) It happens 95% of the time. I'm wondering where to go to fix it because, otherwise, I love this kettle! Suggestions?"
4,Wife loves it,"Mothers day gift from the kids. Wife loves it, heats water quickly. Noisy, though, and the outside remains hot for quite a while. Not insulated. But works well and good value."
4,Good quality kettle,I've had this kettle for over 2 years now and it still works as well as when I first received it. But it's a pain in the rear to keep it clean from the outside.
3,Returned once and got new one,My first kettle was leaking.. I eventually got a new one.. The second one is working well. But it was pretty anoying to return and get a new one.
1,Leaks!,"This kettle leaked from the control on the base. I left it the first night on a wood buffet, which now has major water spot six inches wide. I replaced it with the hamilton beach, a bit more expensive, but no leaks.."
1,Auto-Off Broken,"I got the kettle with the auto-off broken.Browsing the reviews it seems as a recurrent problem, which is very dangerous !It is a wonder how the manufacturer still able to sell this model !"
3,Needs Work - But Useable,"I had previously owned a $20 kettle, bought at the Superstore in Canada, that worked like a charm. In comparison, this one fails in several regards: it is much smaller (I guess the liter capacity needs to be noted), but works for the average kitchen. I used my previous one to heat water for cooking, so loved the higher capacity. Another major faux pas is that the water capacity guage, the liter marker, does NOT work at all. I bought two of these, and on both, I cannot see the water level through the guage - Am I doing something wrong??! Finally, in my previous kettle, the lid came all the way off - and this had many advantages - including cleaning, re-filling and also basic use. On this, the lid stays on. Would I recommend this to other buyers? Sure. Would I buy another for myself or someone? Nope."
2,Doesn't shut off by itself & Broken filter,"The kettle worked well for the first few days. Then the problems started. The kettle stopped shutting itself off when water starts to boil; now we need to turn it off manually every time. It's a huge pain. Also, the filter that sits at the mouth of kettle kept falling off, so we have just taken it out completely."
1,Leaking on the bottom of the kettle,Not understand why there are over thousand buyers... I purchased this one 2 days ago and it has leaking problem. Very poor quality check.
4,The second kettle works just fine,"The first kettle delivered sprung a leak that caused a small puddle to form on the counter top. Amazon was contacted and there replacement precedure went into action very quickly and smoothly. A second kettle was dispatched almost immediatly and a FedEx return lable for the defective item provided. This whole procedure was remarkably simple. An occasional defective item will occur and is annoying but the procedure to replace the defective item worked very well and reduced the annoyance to a minimum.The replacement kettle has worked as designed without any sign of leakage for close to month now, and assuming it contiues to do so, we would be happy to recommend this kettle."
1,Should Have Listened to the Other Reviewers!,"I decided to take a chance on this kettle because there were quite a few positive reviews. I figured maybe I'd get one of the good ones. Hah! I got a leaker. It leaked after the first use. I tried it 2 more times just to be sure and it leaked both times. Also, the filter that came with it was not like the one shown in the picture. Mine was silver, not gold, and didn't have the cross pieces. Very flimsy filter. And the spout was different also. There were no tabs for the filter to slip into. You just snap the filter in place and hope it stays. All in all, a waste of time. Thank heaven for Amazon's 30 day return policy."
3,Not that great,"When I looked at the reviews, I thought I'm getting a great value! Well this was the first time I was unsatisfied. It's very shaky and seems it wouldn't last for long. I decided to go with another.."
4,"Functional, yet worrisome","I got this tea kettle as a gift from my mother last Christmas. While it is very functional, I noticed something odd that could be troublesome in the future. First, the inside looks awful. It looks like the water has affected the metal in such a way that is causing flakes of metal to come away. Not only does it look bad, I find little chunks of metal in the kettle every time after I use it. Luckily, it has the filter, but if it didn't I'm sure I would have accidentally ingested metal. For now, I'm fine with it, but I will be definitely be choosing my own kettle in the near future."
4,Heats 1.5 litre water in 5 minutes!,"This product has made life so much easier. Less use of microwaves led to warming water up on stoves: big time-hog!. In winter time, we'd take the short cut and take hot water from the faucet from potable purposes which has been advised against. This kettle is just what we needed. Can heat up half a cup to a liter and a half - versatility ranks high! Good sturdy construction. easy to use. Used for cooking, medicinal and household purposes.If I have to take points away its because the cord that is hidden at the bottom, can not be expanded to the exact length needed as there is just one opening from where the cord comes out from under the bottom so I am left with at least some hanging cord with all configurations that I tried. Otherwise the product does everything it promised. I am very happy with the purchase!"
1,Broken in <3 months,"I bought this kettle in March 2011. My wife really loved it, because it has a nice capacity and boiled water quickly, and it has a nice looking finish/design. However, somewhere around late May or early June 2011 it simply stopped working. The light comes on, but no heating action occurs."
5,A great kettle!,"I've had my Aroma stainless steel water kettle for about 4 months. So far, it works great! It does exactly what it's supposed to do... it heats water FAST. I keep my kettle at work, in my office. I use it for making coffee and tea at my desk- I'm saving a lot of money by no longer going out to buy hot beverages. Since I purchased my kettle, several people have inquired about it and some have gone on to purchase their own. Assuming the lifespan of the product is acceptable, I'd purchase this again! I'm quite pleased with this kettle!*NOTE*: When the kettle was new I noticed that the water had a slight plastic-y taste if I filled the kettle to the maximum fill line- presumably because it was coming in contact with the plastic mesh strainer near the pour spout. I didn't notice this issue if I filled it slightly less full."
2,thermostat failed,"I had this for only 2 weeks when I noticed it was not shutting off after the water was heated. The thermostat must have quit working. It just kept boiling and boiling until I would shut it off. I waited too long to be able to send it back without paying the postage. I ordered it in September and this is October- a little over a month since I got it. Now I am stuck with it unless I pay return postage. I like the way it heats the water and it is pretty looking, too bad the thermostat is broke. I would have accepted a replacement, but that option is not there now."
2,Aroma cordless water kettle from Amazon,"The kettle sometimes boils on and on and I have to turn it off manually. I thought this was a flaw in the one I had ordered, so I exchanged it for the same model. I have the same problem. I'm afraid that if I leave the kitchen the water will boil away and a fire could start."
5,Great Teapot!!,"I have been using this teapot for over 2 years now everyday. I make coffee every morning so it is has held up for about 600+ uses already. It boils really fast about a minute per cup of water approximately. I love that it is metal because you don't taste the plastic burning after constant use. The metal is easy to clean and the teapot itself doesn't leave that white crusty film inside. When it does have it, it is very easy to clean. Highly recommended!!"
3,"Great, but mine leaks","When I first used it I filled it up to the max water limit and tested it out. I noticed that once the boiling was complete, there was small water drops dripping from the handle. Just so you know, it was maybe 4 or 5 drops, which is very little. I tried to figure out why and could only conclude that it was leaking from where the handle enters the metal kettle. Maybe with all the heat there is some kind of expansion or something that causes some drops of water to leak out. Not sure if this is just my kettle but no one else has complained about it so its probably just a one off thing. Still, it heats water very quickly and the few drops that fall off it doesn't bother me too much."
2,Good in the beginning,"This electric kettle worked great to start with, however, 3 weeks into it the automatic shutoff button stopped working. I returned the kettle today and ordered a Braun AquaExpress instead. Wish I'd read the reviews of other kettles before trying this one."
3,"Functional...and loud, and VERY hot.","If you want a super hot kettle, this may be the one for you. I bought it to take to work, and it's both extremely loud (compared to my cheapo plastic one) and VERY hot (even the exterior gets very got -- too hot to touch). It's a beautiful object, easy to hold, fun to pour, pretty inside, too. The water boils very quickly. I like it. But, as I said: very loud when it's boiling (so loud I'm afraid I'll disrupt my office-mates), and so hot that you'll burn yourself if you touch anywhere but the plastic handle."
1,HO-RRI-BLE beyond words,"In the review section, there was a few reviews on how some symtons that will happen to the kettle after one month of using it. When I first bought it, I tested it on my first day. It was fine and quick. An hour later, we tried again but the symtons happen. It was only a few hours after buying it. The kettle did not automatically turn off after a long time. When I went to check on it, the light was still on. I quickly the turn it off and when I try to pour the hot water, but the handle burnt me. I returned the kettle that night."
2,Great but Rust,"I bought this kettle about 6 months ago. I use it to pre-heat my coffee mug.For 6 months, everthing worked great. It is very intuitive to use. It heats the water very fast. It has an auto-shut off feature. It was difficult to clean, but I have started a process where I dump the remaining water and then reheat the kettle to burn off any excess water (keeping it dry and mildew free).However, if you look inside the kettle, the bottom plate is distinct from the walls. While everything is stainless, the wels from the bottom plate to the wall plate are starting to show signs of rust. That is not good because that can work its way into your beverage. So, I am going to buy an all glass kettle next time."
1,Absolute rubbish,"Positively the worst kitchen appliance we have ever bought. We bought this because it was recommended on this site, and compared with our old kettle (left behind in the UK), this is a complete waste of money. It takes ages to boil - I am surprised by the reviews suggesting this is quick, and the thermostat takes ages to switch off once the water is boiling, which is an unnecessary waste of electricity. Our thermostat is now not shutting off at all(in a 5 month old kettle), meaning the kettle is now an electrical hazard, and like the previous reviewer, I have discovered that the warranty is almost worthless. It requires the kettle to be posted at our expense, including a further $10.00 for return postage (a third of the value of the item!), and allowing 2-4 weeks for return shipping! I suspect that these sort of provisions, which make the warranty without value, are probably not valid as a matter of law, but I don't really want a replacement so we are not pursuing this."
2,Lasted only 6 months!,"Once my two GE kettles (purchased from a giant chain) called it quits after each of them worked fine for one or two years, I thought it was time to turn elsewhere. I decided to buy this model as it was one of the top selling brands in its class. Despite warnings given by some buyers about the poorly designed switch, I went ahead with purchase. At that time I noticed that the brand new kettle will not turn off automatically after the water is fully boiled at times, leading to the drying of the chamber. Six months down the road, the switch cannot be pushed down to the ""on"" position any more rendering the kettle useless. The manufacturer should redesign the switch to make it a fine product."
5,Exactly as I expected,"Absolutely love this kettle. Heats water up extremely quickly, fits in perfectly with my stainless steel appliances and has allowed me to finally get into the habit of drinking tea consistently. I always wanted to drink Green Tea instead of pop but the idea of heating up a kettle on the stove and make a ton at a time always turned me off. So did microwaving the water and then making tea which apparently is the worst way. This is simple, fill it up to the MIN line, press the lever down, let it make it's magical boiling noises, get your tea and cup ready (or tea and pot), as soon as you hear the click take it off, fill up your vessel and enjoy. Very glad I made this purchase."
3,For my office,Bought this for my office to use as we drink a lot of tea everyday. It works just fine. I have no complaints.
5,Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle,"Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle has exactly the size, what I needed.It works good. Recommend it."
3,good quality but too loud when boiling,"I bought this kettle. I like the sleek design, great materials. But when it boils the water, it is quite loud. I had a different one, which am comparing this one to. The previous one was a little more quieter."
1,Quality changes pretty quick,You will like it once u get it but by time passing u will hate it. It gets rusted pretty quick. It takes to long until the water get boiled after the fourth month of use. Disappointing!
4,Great kettle!,"This is a great kettle that I would recommend. I bought it because we do not have a way to boil hot water at work and I love tea. I've been using it for about a week.Pros:- Boils water in 5 minutes or less- Keeps water hot enough to enjoy a second glass without having to reheat- It's cordless- It looks very nice and there is no metal/plastic tasteCons:- It will not let you boil water for an indefinite amount of time. As I use tap water it would be nice to have the option to keep the water boiling to kill everything.- It builds up mineral deposits fairly quickly so I anticipate I will have to clean it with vinegar at least once a week.- The water level indicator is hard to see when filling up water. I have had to pour it out several times because I want past max.The pros outweigh the cons though, and I have to say I am very happy with this kettle!"
5,Love it !!!,"I bought this kettle as a gift for my 90yr old mother. Out of all the gifts I've given her in my life time, this one was the grand prize (her words). It is not too heavy for her to handle and looks great on the countertop. Since it is cordless, she is able to thaw her frozen birdbath on freezing mornings. It's so convenient to make her hummingbird sugar water as well as her morning tea and coffee. A huge plus is that it isn't made of plastic, like so many of the others on the market. I am ordering one for myself as well."
3,Leaking out of the Bottom,"My mother-in-law bought this for me for Christmas 09 and now its April '10. This pot has been working great for us. We used it at least once every day since we got it. However, this week it started really leaking water out of the bottom of the kettle where the on/off switch is at. My MIL contacted amazon to see what could be done and they said they would refund half of the purchase price but that I had to pay the shipping back to the company. The refund would pay for the shipping so its not worth it. It worked like a champ for the time that it worked."
3,"Not bad, but lees than expected","I don't want to repeat what others already said about this item. It's not a bad product. Heats water fairly fast, etc. It doesn't feel sturdy/heavy enough, which I don't like. But the biggest problem is the shut-off mechanism. It takes too long to shut it down - you can hear the water boiling heavily, but it takes a good minute or so after it started to boil to shut the power off. A waste of electricity if you asked me."
3,works ok but I got one that leaks (manufacturing defect),"Pros: boils water quickly. Auto shut off works good but only if the cover is securely closed. Cover must snap to be closed.Cons: the min fill level is about 32 ounces and I use it to heat water for one large tea cup per day so I end up heating about twice as much water as I need.After a few months of once per day use, I noticed puddles on the kitchen counter if I left water in the unit over night, also rust forming on the seam at the base of the kettle. I found a post on line where leak was a manufacturing defect. I am attempting to get a replacement at no cost from the mfg (Aroma Co.). Their warranty is almost useless as I would be required to pay return postage almost equal to the cost of the item. I gave this item 3 stars due to the defect, otherwise it would have gotten more."
2,priced too high,"It was okay, and I was using it fine. But after a visit at Walmart or Costco, I found that a competitive kettle was sold with $10 less than this one. If I knew this before, I will not make the order. Also, the cord has to be swirled manually being ""cordless"". The label ""cordless"" was a bit misleading to me. Customers may wish for an automatic winding cord instead."
3,It takes a long time to boil water,"The task is as simple: boil water and yet this electric kettle takes so long in doing it, besides making a huge noise. The only problem is it gets really hot and you can burn just by touching it. Be careful to use only the handle. I've had it for a couple of months and have experienced no leaks or problems with the auto-off. I hope it stays that way."
5,at last a good cup of tea,I really am very satisfied with this tea pot. Can't believe I didn't purchase one sooner.
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, this kettle came stained...not sure what it is, almost looks like a coffee dribble all the way down the side from top to bottom - won't rub off. Bought as a gift for my dad but this simply won't be good enough."
