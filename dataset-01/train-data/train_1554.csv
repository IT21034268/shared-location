3,Mixed Blessing in Studying XML with This Book,"Currently an XML learner, I find this book quite helpful because of its vivid and interesting examples, which are rarely found in other resourses. On the other hand, this book contains a host of editing errors, which, to some extent, CAN test your XML knowledge hard-learnt so far from the book.If these editing errors are revised in the next edition, I think I will give the book four to five stars."
3,Pass if by if you have a Sony widescreen,"I have the DVD-910 and the image flickers when connected to a sony wide-screen tube television. It seems that several others are having the same problem, so you may wish to pick another player if you have a Sony KV-34XBR800, KV-34HS510 or KV-30(or 34)XBR910.Apart from the flickering, the player works fine and the image is very clear. The DVD-910 was rated very highly on the Secrets of Home Theater webpage."
1,greatwurm was right,"If only I had stumbled upon the earlier review BEFORE wasting my time by: purchasing this player; taking it home and encountering flickering whem playing on my Sony XBR; exchanging it for another of the same model (having assumed that I just got a lemon); and then returning home to find the same flickering. Now a third transaction is necessitated, and suffice it to say I will not be going with a Denon. Pathetic that they have failed to correct this apparent incompatibility w/ a major maker like Sony."
3,"Clunky, not worth the price","Despite the Denon name and the relatively high price tag, this is not a great DVD player. There are distinct, noticable pauses between layer changes, and the user interface is clunky and slow."
5,Gorgeous music by Liszt for Christmas,"I can add much to what the previous two reviewers said, except to say that this is another great and somewhat unusual disc from Hyperion. Its beautiful music for Christmas. I've had it for years and we listen to it more and more each Christmas."
1,gypsy curses,"Story could have been exciting but somehow wasn't. I'm sure some authentic gypsies somewhere would be horrified with the stereotype presented here. The ""curse"" revealed was bad but not that bad and led to a frustrating romance - of sorts - between Adriana and Edward. Description from back cover:Adriana was overjoyed to be living at last at magnificent Castlereagh Manor. But her happiness swiftly turned to despair. The castle was isolated and lonely. She was allowed no visitors. Her beloved aunt had become morose and silent. Riding was her only pastime, but Sir Edward Devereux, her handsome, brooding guardian had forbidden it. A terrible curse lay on the castle and its family - this she knew. Then one day, against her guardian's orders, she rode out to the Black Heath and there she met the cruel and evil Gypsies. Suddenly she knew the true meaning of terror . . ."
2,Far inferior to Machaut Mess done by Ensemble Gilles Binchois,"Having become extremely familiar with the Ensemble Gilles Binchois Messe (which includes the Gregorian propers and thus gives the entire mass), I could not bear to listen to the mangled Latin of this Hilliard performance of this mass and am returning it. I would have loved to have a second performance of a beloved piece."
4,The best of Olivencia's romantic side.,"Olivencia is mostly known for his salsa dura classics ""Trucutru"", ""Plante Bandera"" and ""Evelio."" However, he did explore salsa romantica which became highly successful during the 80's and 90's. Some of his best during that time are included in this album, from ""Lapiz de Carmin"" to Tricoche's ""Lobo Domesticado, and my personal favorite ""No me Tires la Primera Piedra."" This is salsa romantica, don't get me wrong, but it still shows some signs of salsa dura, and Olivencia pays tribute to his past hit in a Medley on the final track, with some of the hits that helped put him on the map. If you're looking for those older classics, this may not be the album for you. Nonetheless, a good album."
4,80's Salsa at it's best,"This was Tommy Olivencia's most popular album and most commercially successful, This whole CD was a hit, from ""Lobo Domesticado"" to the Medley at the end. Hector Tricoche proves his worth on this album and then some. Junior ""Paquito"" Acosta is also great. The funny thing with Paquito Acosta is that he has released 3 solo albums and nobody has ever heard of him."
3,Tommy's triumphant entry into the salsa romantica world.,"The salsa romantica trend had become extremely popular by the time this album was released and the huge hits ""Lobo Domesticado"", ""Lapiz De Carmin"" and ""No Me Tires La Primera Piedra"" were all quite good. Of course, it goes without saying that this album can't compare with Tommy's ""Secuestro"", ""Juntos De Nuevo"" and ""Plante Bandera"" CDs but it's nonetheless a fine example of late-1980s salsa. Lead vocals on this one are by Paquito Acosta and Hector Tricoche."
2,LOVED THE SHOW,Be careful...i ordered this received it and it only has the 2nd disc in it.........but i enjoyed the episodes that i did watch
2,Where's Savage Dragon?,"Wow, it's hard to believe this piece of garbage finally got a DVD release, while Savage Dragon doesn't? Where are all the good shows that used to be on USA cartoons in the 90's? Sure, if you like 90's cartoons this is a good one, but not nearly as good as Phantom 2040 or even the American Street Fighter cartoon."
1,I cant believe I wasted my money on this garbage!,"Wow, I didnt even make it through two episodes. Worse than that, I wasted about $40 on the thing. Oh well, live and learn. The animation is subpar at best, and the dialogue is terribly cliche'd. The animation on the 80's Dungeons & Dragons cartoon is a million times better. Too bad, because Jim Lee is a great comic book guy."
1,boring kids stuff,"i bought this because i really liked the Jim Lee Wildcats comics. However, these Wildcats cartoons fell far short of its printed parent. The animation itself was OK, nothing ""Wild"" and it was fun to see the characters come alive. However, the dialogue was terrible. How many times can each character spout off in cliche? The characters were so textbook old school comics, like the Hellspont cackling HA HA HA after revealing his eeeeevil plan. The dialogue was so bad, i could not engage in the stories. Even the opening song was pathetic: ""We're heroes not zeros""?? Please."
4,WildCats the Complete Series DVD is great!,"Wildcats the complete series DVD is great! Jim Lee's WildCats the complete series is a great buy! You get 13 episodes of WildCats: Season 1 on a 2-disc set! This is the first and only season of WildCats: covert action teams. That's why it's called WildCats the complete series! There are some great extras on the DVDs! There is a 25-minute interview with comic book legend, Jim Lee! There is a Jim Lee profile,extras related to WildCats cartoon series which aired on TV in 1997. Jim Lee is my favorite comic book artist, so getting this was a no-brainer! I highly recommend this DVD set!"
5,Yes! It's about time!,"Holy cow this is so exciting! I remember this cartoon from when it came on and it rocks. At first, I did not know that it was based off of Jim Lee's ultracool Wildstorm comic book by the same name, but upon seeing how much fun this cartoon was I quickly fell in love with the comics. Jim Lee has been arguably the most important comic artist of the last 20 years, and this TV show demonstrates why: an amazing ability to craft fun, inventive story lines with cool, original characters. Yes, there are resemblences to Jim's early work on the X-Men, but that similarity is largely due to the fact that almost every modern superhero team owes some due to the X-Men.This cartoon is a load of fun as are the comics and I'm so excited that they are releasing it on DVD. Thanks!!!"
5,Realistic and romantic!,"Unlike a lot of time-travel romance, this one really FELT like the heroine was in another time, and that it was strange to her. The ""wounded hero"" turned out to be wonderfully heroic in the end, and the villain -- apparently actually a historical person! -- was wonderfully frightening. A true ""keeper"" and I sure hope there's a sequel soon!"
5,Ground-breaking crossover romance!,"Rosemary Edghill's MET BY MOONLIGHT is groundbreaking romance. It's true ""crossover"" which will appeal to adventurous romance readers and fantasy readers alike. Trust Edghill to do something ""different"" that breaks the rules and succeeds in doing so."
1,The very best of the Four Pennies,I got it promptly on time. And it's a very good cd. I like old music so that's why I got it. And it's an old group that I like.
5,I love Shu Uemura,"I love Shu Uemura. I have a lot of favorite lines but by far it my favorite. All the products are of exceptional quality but also they are not harsh to the skin. I like the eyeshadows because they are so soft, they not hard on the eye area, if you live where they have a concept store, go and check it out,but if not you can find at department stores.

5,A role model for independent thought.,"As an author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco), as a psychotherapist, as a citizen of the United States of America, and as a citizen of the world, I applaud this brilliant collection of essays. Ms. Kingsolver writes simultaneously from the mind and heart, consequently inspiring the reader to think and feel about a variety of important things, from bookstores to global politics. And she entertains us all along the way.With this book Barbara Kingsolver has for me become a new role model for the importance of independent thinking. Buy several copies, pass them out to your friends, and have some wonderful conversations on somebody's front porch."
2,Not as good as her fictional work,"I have read all of Kingsolver's fiction and am a big fan; however, I found these essays preachy and even irritating. Her voice is just a little too pious and seems to assume her audience is made up of clueless shopaholic shell-collecting fast food-chomping dimwits. In attempting to create parables out of ""State of the World 2001"" issues, she made broad and compelling problems seem almost pedantic. Her usual originality, insightfulness, and clever wit does not come through. I was disappointed."
3,Reflection or mirror-gazing? A lot of both.,"The themes of the book are truly important and the opinions expressed are compelling, but from the first chapter onward I found the writing to be marred by a preachy and self-congratulatory tone and a tendency for the author to inject herself intrusively into otherwise fascinating narratives. (Ms. Kingsolver occasionally seemed to recognize the preachiness, but only to deny it explicitly.) I would highly recommend this book for its content, but as the first example I've read of Ms. Kingsolver's writing, it leaves me with no desire for further acquaintance with her work."
1,If I want sermons I'll go to church!,"As a lover of all Kingsolvers novels, short stories and other essays, I was fully prepared to love Small Wonder as well. Much to my dismay, I HATED it. I understand in essays people often give opinions, but BK is so excessively preachy on her pet subjects, (environmentalism,. etc) that I could not finish the collection. I felt like she was putting me down because I watch TV and carry a cell phone. Well excuse me! I have never read anything so nauseatingly self-righteous in my life. Thank goodness I got it from the library."
5,a wonderful discovery,"I was pleasantly surprised by this little book, which, though small, speaks volumes about the twenty-first century world and how we might live in it. I suppose fiercely pro-war advocates might choose to be offended by some of her views, but Kingsolver is not so much anti-war as pro-humanity. Yes, she does make an argument for peace, because, as a person of faith, she does not believe that hatred can be dispelled by more hatred.She writes beautifully about the role of nature and the ways that we need to re-embrace it. She writes about loving others and finding wonderful blessings in the midst of darkness. This is a book for anyone who feels despair over the increasing violence in the world, for anyone with a pure faith, for anyone who loves nature.If you love this book, also check out books by Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry."
1,Insulting to Americans,"Small Wonders is rambling and self-serving. I felt that it was written to try defend her point of view, much of which has come under scrutiny, and to win back some of Kingsolver's lost fans; lost due to her airing her anti-american polital views. Kingsolver has a lot of nerve trying to manipulate readers by using historical events to support her warped views. I will never buy another book of hers again."
2,Moen singel tp holder,"arms of holder are too wide and the roll of toilet paper falls through the holder, I do not recommend it"
3,Not the old TV shows,"I was expecting the old black and white TV shows I remember from childhood. Sorry, it is not.which disappointed me."
5,Comedy gold,DVD contains hours of comedy enjoyment of this classic duo. Item was priced reasonably and shipped quickly. I would recommend this item to anyone.
5,Revisited the days of Ma & Pa Kettle,I very much enjoyed seeing the old movies about Ma & Pa Kettle. I laughed so hard.They were the hillbillys of the 50s. Great set of movies.
5,MA & PA KETTLE,WHAT A RIOT. HAVE WATECHED THEM ON ONE OF THE OLDER TYPE TV CHANNELS AND REALLY LIKED THEIR COMEDY. I BOUGHT THIS COLLECTION AND HOPE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS.
2,Disappointed,Several videos hang up and the sound is not the greatest. Disappointed with this product I am happy with most of the items I buy at Amazon but not this time. If I was going to buy again I would buy each movie separate not as a special package of all 5 movies together.
5,Fantastically Funny,These movies are very funny and enjoyable to all ages. Brings back a lot of memories of watching them as a child. Everyone needs happiness put back in their lives and with these movies you can not watch them and not enjoy them.
4,very happ customer,I watched this show as a kid a very long time ago. Hard to remember all about it and saw it on this site so thought that I would buy it and have something to watch with my son. Ha Ha even though it is in black and white he loves it as much as I did when I was a young boy. Thanks for making some of the old shows available.
4,Ma and Pa Kettle collection DVD,"Had a little problem with the 1st dvd freezing up but other than that,,,,I love the movies. I grew up on these type and wish there were more movies made with good ole humour"
5,ma and pa kettle movie,I love those ma and pa kettle movies. They are so funny. Better than some of those movies they produce today. Real down home fun and clean language.
5,Ma & Pa Kettle,"This series was made during a time when comedies were truly funny without actors using any profanity or sexual situations. Think ""I Love Lucy"" type of comedy except the protagonists are a couple instead of one headliner. The situations these people get into are sometimes silly but always relatable. It's good clean family fun."
5,Finding love in the friendly skies.....,"Lauren Traynor a rule. Passengers are strictly off limits romantically. Then she meets Michael Townsend. Michael tries to stay away, but there is something about Lauren that he can't deny himself. Will Michael admit that he truly loves Lauren and can Lauren get over the fact that she can allow herself to trust and love or risk losing Michael forever? This book is full of passion, and a nice romance. Excellent read!!!!"
5,Unisex watch,"I bought in white and its great I think amazon has a missed conception of the watch It should say womens watch or unisex watch no mens, because de case is midsize and the leader band is womens. The watch fit me perfect and looked stunning I highly recommended it"
3,200 more songs yay! But who added them?,"Delivered right away, 200 songs for mom's karaoke microphone. Happy with the price and the ease of use and it also comes with pages to add to the song book - great!Only warning is that the songs seem interpreted at a lower quality than the original 200 that come with the mic. Some of the lyrics are out of sync and many of them have wrong and misspelled words. This wouldn't be a problem, except that it's hard to get a good score singing when the melody is three beats ahead of the lyrics.However, as easy as the leadsinger mic is to use, it's nice to be able to immediately add another 200 songs.d"
1,It's a LIBRARY BOOK!,"So disappointed. It took forever to get the book, and when I did- it was a LIBRARY book from Dekalb, Illinois! Yep- it had the plastic cover, the library card with the date stamps, a barcode as well as random stamps throughout the book stating ""DeKalb Public Library"" What a joke! Im so annoyed- this was to be a gift. I feel duped!"
1,I can park better by eye.,"My friend recommended this item and I was excited to get one for Myself, My Mom, and My Dad. Unfortunately although my friend loved it It did not work for me or my parents. I found that I can park better by eye and the battery is always dying. I also found that a 2X4 right where the tire should stop works good too."
3,Colorful but unconvincing,"Even from a videotaped live performance, Midori has a wonderful violin tone. I remember the first time I heard her caprices, how great the tone was and how lush and expressive a vibrato she had even then.It would be easier to compare Midori to Kreisler than Heifetz because she really has the elegant thing down but not the show off virtuoso part of the equation. Like Kreisler, I found her taking many liberties with respect to rythms for the sake of articulation expression and accuracy. Many times I can see she is just plain not confident and missing some kind of conviction that says Im all over this.Robert McDonald is a superb and masterful pianist without a doubt but banga banga banga he's too loud and drounds out the violin. Perhaps he is a great soloist but it seems to me he should try to play with people better then he did here."
3,Great idea book,"This book was a purchase I dont regret, but it could be better. While it has wonderful ideas and great pictures, the project instructions it gives could be more detailed with pictures that illustrate every step. There are a few projects in there, that are mostly detailed with text, and if you cant picture what they are saying, then the project becomes very difficult to accomplish. Like I said, I dont regret my purchase of this book, but it could have been done better."
3,"Not a bad woodturning book, but not the best","I guess for someone that has never turned anything, this would be a great book. But most of the segmented info was basic stuff, though it did have a couple good projects. Since I paid $8 for it, I would say it is a good addition to my library, but if I had paid the $40 that it was being sold for from woodcraft, I would have been upset."
4,Awesome book,This is a great book teaching you some great family values. read to find out what happens in the book!
2,Should have paid attention to reviews before purchasing!,Like the first review said this trimmer does not cut off clean. You end up with chewed off instead of cut trimmings. My old trimmer (not a B & D)was 100% better. I am sorry that I purchased this inferior trimmer.
2,Chews & splinters,"""Trimmer"" saws and chews (splinters)its way through shrubs, bushes, etc. No one can say it cuts. It does successfully chew to length."
3,A few less than leaving your lover!,"I enjoyed this short book, though I felt that I wanted more profound experiences to occur in this story of transformation. It is, however, a sweet and well-told tale of one man's reevaluation of his life and the assistance that a wise man gives him. I recommend this book for high school aged students and am planning on using it in my class! It has wonderfully fun illustrations and is extremely easy to read. It does also make the mouth water for mangoes, which is a lovely experience regardless!"
4,Tanpuras Support.,Excellent product. A must have for all students of Indian music. The ultimate ambient album and great for meditation.
4,good album,"sure miss buddy miles, a groundbreaking musician. This is a good album to add to the collection"
3,There Is No Death,"Very easy book to read, written in simple plain language, very important in relating the subject content, therefore helps understanding and clarity of it. I would recommend it to young people, some adults too who need an understanding about what happens when we passover into death. My teenage daughter found it beneficial after her father passed over recently."
4,School project costume,My daughter wore his for her medieval project at school. It came on time as promised and I was very pleased with it.
5,Child Julliet Dress,My daughter needed this dress to portray the Medieval Times. The dress is super pretty. Great costume at a reasonable price.
5,"Great product, good quality","Good product, good packaging and a nice flavor/smell etc.. Came promptly. Steep shipping charges. Gave it someone as a gift and they are very happy. So I am happy."
2,poor picture quality,"I have tried all I know how to do to make this lense work and produce a quality picture. It is not what I would call a quality lense, I have tried to return it to the supplier to no avail. I have given them everything they have asked for and after three e-mails I have not had this resolved nor have I had any more than 1 response to my inquirey for methods of return. so I cannot reccomend this lense or Cameta as a supplier."
2,No Razzle Dazzle,"I enjoyed both the revival production and the revival CD of Chicago. When they came up with the marketing ploy of a special 10th anniversary multi-disc set, this ""Chicago"" fan bought it even if the revival CD (which I already have) is part of the set. The various artist disc of famous stars who have starred in the production in the last 10-years did not offer anything exciting or interesting in their rendition other than their famous names. Worse, the documentary was not well presented and the clip from the show was actually just a teaser. It is so sad because Chicago is now the longest running revival in Broadway history and they have decided to put up a forgettable memorabilia that ""Chicago"" lovers will not treasure in the years to come. Such a waste. To ironically paraphrase a line in the show, there was simply ""no razzle dazzle""."
4,Not what I was expecting,"I grew up with the wooden game of Labyrinth so when I saw this one, I was all over it. It's a good concept but not a very good game. It's a little boring."
1,DON'T BUY THIS - IT WILL BURN YOU,"I bought this product and cooked with it ONCE over a wood fire and the glue holding it together melted away and when I picked it up, a searing hot piece of metal flew back and burned my arm."
2,Did the job but...,Decent design and price. Did the job but not without a few casualties. The slots are too wide and a few hot dogs easily slipped through..
4,The cutest dang little CD,"Manufactured and packaged to look like a small 45 rpm vinyl release from RCA. Includes She's Not You (classic Elvis), the alternate version of She's Not You (doesn't have all the wacky, doo wop background vocals - too bad!), and Tell Her Jim Said Hello (a pedestrian piece of work)."
1,author disappointed,"THank you for being interested in my book, but I must say this one is not worth the paper it's printed on. For some reason the first half of the story was left out at print. Please look for this book later this year under the title of ""Brielle and the Castle Siege"" by TWC. Your support is appreciated."
2,Non stick surface doesn't hold up well,"This griddle doesn't have a very good nonstick finish. It is hard to clean & easily scuffed using a no-scratch pad. Once the surface is scuffed, everything you cook on it will stick, no matter how much oil you use.It is the perfect size to fit over 2 burners of over a camp stove or 2 RV burners. Probably too small for household use."
2,Disappointing for a Coleman product,"Have had two of these griddles. They warped easily. Go with a TFal griddle for about $30. Much better quality, same size, deeper sides (about 1"" deep compared to about 1/4"" on this Coleman), and better handles. The nonstick surface on the first one we owned got trashed when I overcooked some eggs and underapplied sufficient oil. Get the TFal!"
3,Good for a nice soak for achey muscles,"This product is nice, I used it several times and twice for running a bath for my son when he had influenza. The therapeutic ingredients in here are nice for achey or sore muscles from over exertion or the flu and it is a very calming product. the reason I only give 3 stars is because I prefer a stronger and more therapeutic smell for the simply reason that the stronger the smell the more ingredients that work on the achey muscles and relieve congestion and open air ways as well.I really like the Mustard Bath I believe by Dr Singh or something, that is a great product and I prefer that in the bath for sore muscles. This product seems more creamy and gentler on the skin though."
3,Good but not perfect,"The dictionary in itself is excellent, one of a series of superlative dictionaries by Collins: the coverage is good, the use of colors is attractive and helpful, paper is good enough, lots and lots of examples.I don't give it a very high rating for two reasons: it uses lots of peculiarly British expressions which, esp. when colloquial or slang, are puzzling to US users; and secondly i find excessive intrusion into the dictionary of the editors' political biases (feminism, environmentalism, socialism, left-wing concepts) which have no place in a responsible dictionary."
1,it's horrible,"it's horrible.. you imagine that now you could put your TV up your wall and you get this box filled wit just 3 metal piece and bunch of screws and with a crappy instruction manuel. the instruction mannnel doesn't explain at all. it's difficult to attach the parts to your TV, it doesn't work with all kind of LCD tvs, it only works wit some specific parts of walls of your house. The only thing I could say is.. ""DON'T BUY IT"""
4,Not bad at all!,"This earlier adventure of Tintin's comes along before the introduction of Haddock and Calculus, but is still alot of fun. I would recommend it to any Tintin fan!"
3,I did not receive what I ordered,"You have already taken care of this problem by refunding my money, but High Country Books still maintains they sent the proper books, 1-6, though my friend for whom they were a gift tells me they definitely did not. However, she wrote and told me she has read the ones they sent, which included a duplicate, and they're all good books, so I guess it wasn't all wasted. I'll attempt this again at a later date from a different source. Jan Karon is a wonderful author, no matter which book of hers you are reading, and that saved this experience for my friend, and your quick refund made me have confidence in Amazon, though I never got any satisfaction from the dealer."
5,Great book set,"The book set was in great condition. Only the first book looked like it was even opened or read. The set was a present, so it was great to see it in such good condition."
2,The best fiction to come along!,I have read all of Jan Karon's The Mitford Years. The reading will transport you to places you've seen or imagined before and make you feel that you know each of her characters. She is inspirational and a wonderful respite in this crazy world of informational overload. You won't look at small town life the same ever again.
2,wrong books,Product was to be books 1-6 but instead I received 2-7. Can't start a series without book 1! This was purchased for a Christmas gift. Warehouse Deals did not do a good job on repackaging these used books.
1,At Home in Mitford,"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. The author jumps from location to location without giving any indication of the change. A conversation between two people in a specific location suddenly ends, and the reader finds--sometimes several paragraphs later--that two entirely different people are now conversing in an entirely different location. This is very hard to follow and quite confusing. Also, the use of pronouns such as ""he"", ""she"", ""him"", and ""her"" leaves the reader wondering to whom the pronouns refer. e.g., ""...as he was running on Church Hill Drive, Barnabas came to a sudden halt, which caused him to crash headlong into a ditch...."" It turns out that the pronouns ""he"" and ""him"" do not refer to Barnabas. I do not recommend this book to anyone who has had a good English education and expects to read a well-written book."
5,The Mitford Years (1-6),Because of a sudden death in my family I haven't had time to read but about 1/2 of the first book (At Home in Mitford) in the boxed set. After reading only 1/2 of the first book I would recommend it highly
4,Fun and funky Brighton chill-out,"A light-hearted album perfect for nodding gently to in the early hours of the morn, preferably by the sea-side, ideally Brighton, home of Skint Records. The Ropeman has similarities to another Skintster, Fatboy Slim, but he's more laid back, with more samples and a groovy Indian vibe throughout. The 9-minute long 66 meters is very pleasing indeed.At first the fairly prolific use of samples seems a bit 80's/early 90's, but after a while you realise that the Indian Ropeman is just having a larf...Buy it if you like to nod..."
3,Disappointing,"The point of this book, while very interesting, was made in the introduction. The rest is merely a well told synopsis of the Torah (although offensive at times - discussing Avraham's sexual prowess). It was interesting reading but there was a lot of unnecessary fluff which failed to hide the authors lack of in-depth knowledge of ancient religion. I recommend this book only for the non-academic. Scholars will be disappointed."
2,Another trite effort,"Cahill's works serve the purpose of introducing cultural perspectives in an easy to read format, but if you know anything about the subject go elsewhere. Mostly a boring re-hash of other, more interesting work."
1,ZERO IS RIGHT!,"This menure is almost as bad revisionism as the irish fairy tale book! He as usual does not sight his sources, and appears to make it up as he goes. Miss MacDonald's review said it very well. If you believe in anything Cahill spews, you may as well believe the ""Sun rises in the west."" I won't waste another nano-second on anything this hack writes."
2,The Celts in Ireland,"Mr. Cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history. He is an excellent and compelling writer, but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear.It was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews, around 500 BC.It was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc., and their cousins, the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today.The author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology."
1,This is a dispicable book that should not be in print.,"Ever since Bill Moyers show on Genesis there seems to be a group of people who take delight in using their reasoning such as it is to bash Torah and our patriarchs and matriarchs.If anyone really wants to know about Torah and the Jews they will read a book by any orthodox rabbi who has studied Torah, knows the traditions, all the writings, and has had worthwhile teachers. This book does not enlighten or create any responsible thinking. It is exploitation of our sacred texts and leaders. It is monumentally offensive. Do not buy this book. One star is the lowest possible rating in this program. It should be a negative."
2,Interesting but incomplete,"Cahill does a good job of establishing that people's myths changed from Sumeria to Israel. However, he fails in two major points. First, he does not establish that the change in myths is an actual change in world-view, as opposed to simply a shift in literary styles. Second, and more importantly, he does not even attempt to document any connection between the world-view of the Israelites and that of the Greeks, from which much of Western civilization descends."
3,good book - good ideas but not enough,"my main complaint about the book was that much of it was storytelling from the BIBLE - stories most people know already. I would have prefered longer discusssions on the ""GIFTs"" and why and how they are gifts."
3,A Little Speculative,"Gifts of the Jews is very entertaining, and certainly well-written. Cahill has a gift for rendering complex ideas and theories into easily-digestible, expertly turned phrases. Unlike ""How the Irish,"" though, this book seems to be more Cahill's own interpretations, rather than anything actually held up by the evidence. It's as if he formulated his thesis first, and then went searching for evidence in the Torah -- a no-no of historical writing. Worth reading, though."
4,A wonderful introduction into western religion,"I disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book in that it should be recognized that this is not an authoritative history of the world. The author tries to make a point of the importance of Judaism in western culture. It's also an excellent introduction to the study of Judaism/Christianity/Islam. It's beautifully written and kept simple. If you are already well-educated about the subject matter, this book is a waste of time for you. Some of the other reviewers seem to have missed the fact that Cahill tries to make it clear that his book is not an all-inclusive or authoritative history and frequently gives references to other academic publications which would give you those qualities.This book is essentially like a 101 class for studying the heirs to Abraham. It was written to be an introduction and it fulfills this goal superbly."
4,I found it fascinating,"Going back that far into history requires some imagination. Thomas Cahill had some very interesting views on what could have happened back then. He rightly points out that Abraham lived a couple of thousand years before the bible as we know it, was actually written down. He made some points in it that forces me to go back into the old testament and reread some printed oral traditions that were put on paper at the time of Moses. Historically, there are still many questions as to what happened 3000 years ago. Heck, we are still speculating about King Arthur and the round table! I thought it was an interesting read, provoked some thought, and he had some points that do make sense. After all, historians keep telling us that history repeats themselves. Maybe he's just trying to prove that point with today's international sagas."
1,HSIRI PRAC!,"This is the second worst book I have ever read! The first, being the authors revisionist barf about the featherweight irish! He writes with the dexterity of a blind bull elephant in a China shop. The chapters have no order, and are incoherent, and he does not sight his sources. An Eskimo knows more about the Jewish people than this crude clown. Read Isaac Asimov and Abba Eban if you want to learn the truth."
1,Gift of the Jews -ARE the Jews.,"No gentile history buff with a penchant for the Bible (which is *the* testament, if that's how you want to call it (the Torah) - there is no ""old"" or ""new"", just ""real"" and ""fabricated"") can do any justice or compare to what a real rabbi who practices and lives the faith, as did his father's father - can tell you about jewish history and signifigance.After all, this - the age of ""enlightenment"" - is really the age of confusion, with so many, many jews sadly assimilated all over the world.And although the author does make *some* valid points, they get lost in the rest of of the text, which can bring only confusion to the misinformed - as one can readily see from some of the reviews posted here.I would then have to agree with the review by ""A reader from New York , October 10, 1998""."
4,A simple easy-to-read history of the bible.,"This book gave me a better understanding of the bible because it gave tangible evidence for events throughout the bible. It basically gave the reason behind why people did what they did without the biblical wording that can sometimes be very confusing and dry. I found ""The Gifts of the Jews"" very easy to read. The quotes were helpful and the footnotes were helpful in understanding the people in the qoutes. I recommend this book to anyone who has a hard time reading or understanding the bible. This will open your eyes as to what happened and make the bible easier to read."
2,"An easy read, but unfortunately limited to ancient times.","Certainly a readable overview of bible stories and their impact on the worldview (monotheism, the idea of progress etc.).However, it seems the Jews didn't do anything worthwhile after about 500 BC. And even then they were seriously backsliding. Just waiting for a saviour I guess.I would have liked to see at least a brief section on how Jews have continued to influence civilization in the past 2000 years . . . eg. providing some of the leading thinkers of Modern times and playing an important role in defining American (thus world) popular culture."
2,A lightweight account of biblical Judaism -- Torah Lite,"The author tries to give an account of the Jews' contributions to civilization -- surely an ambitious task, walking in the footsteps of such giants as Heinrich Graetz or the modern Robert M. Seltzer. What Cahill ends up producing is a collection of Cliff Notes to the Hebrew Bible. He seems to inject some ""authenticity"" to his personal commentary by using the Hebrew names of most of his biblical heros -- although not all. His unfamiliarity with biblical Hebrew leads to some odd etymological speculation -- a delightful diversion for cognescenti, but misleading for everyone else. The reader should beware of any writer who claims to discuss the Hebrew Bible but relies -- like Cahill does -- entirely on a secondary reference work (The Anchor Bible Lexicon) to source his comments. This is a truly annoying book. Two stars are granted strictly for the entertainment value of this otherwise insipid puree."
1,Less Than Zero,"What a bunch of chazzerai. That's the nicest thing I can say about this garbage pile of words. This book was highly recommended to me by a 67 year old orthodox Jewish man. Cannot for the life of me understand how he could recommend this pile of drek to anyone. This is the last time I go on a friend's recommendation and ignore the Amazon reviews. I'm glad it cost only one cent plus the shipping. Actually the one cent was waaay too much to pay. Honestly, I did not waste my time reading the whole thing. The disgusting snakes imagery and pornographic imagery that the author employed were totally unexpected and uncalled for. WTF? You can rest assured that the next time this friend recommends a book, I'll be sure NOT to read it."
1,Useless book...,"Out of 4.000 books I own only 3 are a total waste of money and space, and this is one of them.... don't want to waste words on it either.."
5,Recommended by my professor,"Bought this book after I graduated from college, but wanted to continue to learn. My religion professor recommended this book. I really enjoyed reading it. Pretty light material, but very informative"
1,I wasted my time.,"A small number of ideas at start and finish of book, but mostly a rehashing of Scripture. (I like the Cliff Notes comment above). Go out and buy yourself a good translation of the Torah instead."
2,Well It is a thesis after all....,"After having stuggled with the unusual style of the author, I finally managed to follow the thought process and read this book. I felt as if the author had decided on the title and then tried everything to justify it. Unfortunately, regardless of the value or lack thereof, there is not much in this book in to back up the title. But the good news is that it is entertaining (just following the obvious misconceptions on the Egyptian's religion is worth it). I guess it is also an interresting look at the bible."
3,Kind of a mess,"Well, this was a change from the other Hinges books, and is definitely my least favorite. The other books are popularized histories: this reads like a long, rambling essay; it's embellished to the point of ridiculousness in places; and the folksy recap of the Bible is not only annoying, but a classic example of a blind man describing an elephant. Cahill doesn't ""get it,"" not at all, not even slightly, and he tries to ""take charge"" of the Bible with a combination of buzzwords and sly interjections of his own opinions.It gets a 3 because it was fun light reading. If you're easily offended, look elsewhere; if you know nothing about the Bible, Judaism, Christianity, etc, but would like to, start elsewhere. The subject deserves a more accurate, dignified, and less ""state of the question"" (as Screwtape so aptly put it) introduction."
1,drop this in a deep ditch,"Lionizing a nomadic culture that began the world's macho ways is just plain wrong. No nomadic culture has ever had respect for the land or the earth, and they stamped out matriarchal civilizations in the process. This book should really be titled 'The Beginning of the End.'"
1,The history of the Jews is not mythology,"After ready Mr. Cahill's book on the Irish, I was very anxious for this book on the history of the Jews. What a dissappointment. Mr. Cahill routinely discounts the narrative history of the Jews presented in the Bible as mythology and he does so without good reason. It's clear that his understanding of Jewish history is limited to the interpretation given by such secular ""scholars"" (heavy sarcasm) as Joseph Campbell. In the preface Mr. Campbell says this is the 2nd of a six part series. Hopefully, he will refrain from tackling early Christian history from the mythological approach. So much good stuff missed due to a lack of understanding on the author's part. Dissappointment is the only adjective to describe this work. Too bad."
4,Excellent book for your Bible study.,This is a fantastic book to give you a further insite on portions of the Old Testament in relation to the history of the Jews from Abraham.
4,"Interesting, a good way to spark your interests.","This book was readable and, all in all, rewarding. It is not and probably should not be seen as an tradionally academic work. The author obviously put a great deal of research behind this book, however, one should not rely on this book as a source. Rather this book brings an ancient people to life in ways that academic books usually do not and can awaken interest in the ancient peoples that mean old teachers/professors usually killed by forcing students to read works that were written by the most boring men on Earth. While I wouldn't be able to rely on this book as an academic source I can appreciate the perspective the author gives of a people that tend to be neglected or misrepresented."
3,Enjoyable,"Cahill's trademark good scholarship and passion for his subject is more than evident in this second book, and the writing is good -- just not quite up to the caliber of How the Irish Saved Civilization. Start with that one; if you love it like I did, this one is worth your time, too."
3,Impractical,"If you are looking for practical insight into Judaism, look elsewhere. This book, while well researched, is written in an obscure manner that is not straight forward in delivering its message. While it is worthwhile to read, it did not satisfy my desire to learn about the practical contributions of the Jewish people"
4,Call for social justice redeems book from pop critics,"Sure, this isn't the definitive book on the Torah or the Jews. But after reading the cold-hearted condenscending reviews of ""biblical scholars'', you'd think the guy was a dope. He's not. The book soars at times, especially at the moment at Sinai and in the development of the prophets. His message to us about God's call for social justice is an urgent reminder for Jews and Christians. Cahill's message contains power and passion. Why do critics make beginners feel stupid if they're moved by it?"
2,Been there..,"For much of this book, Cahill seems to have merely paraphrased most of the Hebrew scriptures. If a reader already has a working knowledge of this text, they may find this book boring and not very informative. Since I came to this book with a good understanding of the Hebrew Bible, I was very disappointed. Perhaps a reader who is not familiar with the Hebrew text would find the large middle section informative and interesting. As for me, it was merely annoying, because I keep waiting for new information or a new insight.However, his commentary of the development of the beginning of Western thought was interesting. It was an angle that I did not consider before. We are so used to Western Civilization being around, that we forget that the thought had to develop at some point. To trace that development was interesting... but I just wish that that tracing did not have to include the paraphrase of much of the Hebrew Bible."
2,Gee-Whiz!,"Much of this book is a rehash of Sumerian legend from Gilgamesh and biblical stories from Genesis and Exodus, without getting into the unique characteristics of the Jews that made them so important to present civilization. Eventually he does get into the subject, but in such a peripheral way that he seems to be straining to try to make his argument. He should have concentrated more on those aspects of Judaism that have truly shaped the west (and he says the undeveloped world also, but that seems to be a real stretch) rather than try to show us that he has read the Old Testament and various versions of Gilgamesh. There is much less to this book than would appear, and his gee-whiz style starts to grate on the reader, at least on this reader."
2,"For ""The Gifts of the Jews"", look elsewhere","How disappointing this book was! Mr. Cahill promised an inside perspective on the history and contributions of these desert nomads, but one soon realizes that the author is really at odds with his subject matter. We will cast aside all presuppositions about early history, he says, and then picks up an old line about humans mutating. No matter how many hours it took to prepare and write this book, what mostly comes across is that the author either never really got to know, or didn't like, the people and their God who he promised to tell us about. As important a theme as ""promises kept"" is to the history of God and Abram, I was fooled by the promises made on the bookjacket that the book came nowhere close to fulfilling."
1,The Gifts of the Jews,"While the title held great promise, the book failed to deliver anything substantial. Attempting to cover his obvious religious roots, the author leaned heavily into a mixture of New Age, atheism and wholly fabricated scenarios not supported by any substantial historical facts. Playing fast and loose with history, he admits to these fabrications with the plea ""It could have happened like that!""At the end of the book, realizing the author has failed to substantiate exactly which ""gifts"" the Jews have given us (not a difficult thing to do for our culture), he baldly asserts God is ""unprovable&quot.; END"
1,Sooo boring,Another crap pointless movie by charled band. Bad acting and bad effects. It should of been called something else cuz u hardly even see the dumb skull heads. And of course it takes place in bands castle(his actual home!) U would think since half gis movies take olace in his OWN HOUSR thaf the budget eould be bigger. But nooooo. Pure crap. Robin sydney sux again.
2,Sydney is hot!,"This was lame!Really bad acting, shallow story line, at least Robin Sydney was nice eye candy."
3,A good starting manual.,"If you have ever hunted (with or without dogs) and if you have ever owned a dog as a pet, then you can basically skip the first four chapters because they deal with common sense issues that every hunter and pet owner should know already. Once the author gets into the actual training of the dog in chapter 5, he does a very good job of explaining exactly how it is that you should train him and what you should expect from him after certain periods of time. I found this book very helpful because after reading it I have a good idea of what I should be doing and when I should be doing it. I'll definately refer back to this book periodically as I train my beagle."
1,Too Basic for a Serious Rabbit Hunter,"This book pales in comparison to every book I have read on the subject of beagles and rabbit hunting. Purchase any Dave Fisher book. Get a copy of Breeding Better Beagles buy John Parks, Beagles and Field Trials by Wayne Price, or Breeding a Strain of Better Beagles by Tom and Velta Dorin. For great beagle story type books, I recommend the Everylasting Stream by Walt Harrison and Wilderness Patchwork by Willet Randall."
5,"Good,Solid, Basic Information","Training a Beagle can be a real challenge. Beagles can be stubborn especially if they get on a scent. This book provides insight on how to handle this great breed without a switch or constant yelling. The author shares his knowledge and experience and describes in great detail how to work with, not against what one would hope becomes a hunting companion and member of the family. The text provided tips I found of great value in training my own dogs. Not for an experienced houndsman, but for a novice or someone thinking about a beagle for companionship or the field, a very informative book."
2,beagle basics,"basically, it only tells you to go out in the field and let the dog do his thing out there. unfortunately if you do not know what you are doing you will never see any wildlife(maybe making to much noise, shouting) it missed many gook pointers that I think a lot of people could have used."
2,Blutengel Child of Glass,I was very disappointed in this selection. Most of their music is excellent. Child of Glass just did not measure up at all.
5,Bach: The Six Trio Sonatas (BWV 525-530) /Herrick,Bach: The Six Trio Sonatas (BWV 525-530) /Herrick~ Johann Sebastian Bach is a wonderful recording with the amazing organist Christopher Herrick. Herrick knows what he is doing and the execution is the with meticulous skill and fortitude. The book-let is very well done with interesting and thought-worthy liner notes. The font is a bit small and is not so easy on the eye. The photo is very nice and one can tell that it was a professional photographer and not one of Herrick's friends. I love the front cover with the gorgeous angel. Highly recommended and I easily give it 5 out of 5 stars.
4,"Good CD, but not the best.","Herrick's recording is excellent. If you want the Trio Sonatas on the organ, get this CD.HOWEVER, the E. Power Biggs recording played on the pedal harpsichord is the best recording of these works in the world. (ASIN: B0000062DK)"
2,"Warning, old edition.","Warning: This is the vol. two of the OLD edition of Omaha, so if you're buying the new edition, you shouldn't buy this book, you should buy the vol 2. of the NEW edition."
1,very cheap material,"this mask looks very cheap,and is itchy on the face. Bought it for halloween but recieved it after even though I paid extra to get it on time. It didnt make a differnce bc i would not have worn it either way. Now to return it the seller wants to charge me a percentage for restocking and pay for return shipping. Will never deal with this seller again for sure"
3,I ended up using a cut up sock.,"This is a very durable mask, and good for a child's costume, but only that. As a 25 year old female, cheap costumes are only okay when they don't look ridiculously cheap. The mask was so durable that it felt like a piece of cardboard cut-out that was placed on my face. I ended up using a cut up sock in order to enhance my costume."
2,Sits too far from the face,This mask sat a bit too far from the face when worn which made it uncomfortable and weird looking to wear. I did some doctoring to it with scissors to make it a little better but I was disappointed I had to do that.
2,Not so fantastic,"We own several of The Wiggles CDs--this one is our least favorite and as such, we don't play it much. There are a couple of really bad songs (i.e. ""I'm a Cow"") which are so hard to hear I have to skip past them...consider a different one by The Wiggles."
4,Good Wiggles CD,"My 23 month old daughter LOVES the Wiggles. If you have The Big Red Car DVD like my daughter does, this CD is a great comliment to it! The songs are very catchy and upbeat. If your child likes The Wiggles, loves to sing and or dance, this is the perfect CD for you! I recommend it!"
2,Only a Few New Songs--Parents Beware!,"Apparently, as the Wiggles become more famous, they are also becoming greedy and more crass. A glance at the titles reveals that almost all of these songs come from the album, ""Dance Party"", (called ""Big Red Car"" in Australia) which has already been released on CD and was one of the Wiggles' first albums.Maybe there are 3 or 4 new songs at most. The original album is pretty good as far as the Wiggles go, so if you don't have ""Dance Party"", it's not a bad choice. But chances are you and your kids have heard most of these songs before, and already own them, too."
4,Time Travel Made Easy,"Well researched, The Secret Shelter provides insight into the lives of those who struggled through the Blitz. I especially liked the time travel concept and how the three modern-day kids had to learn to deal with the bombs, scarcity of food, and blackouts.This book would be a great introduction to some of the realities of WWII. And it's was much easier to digest this information while being entertained by likeable main characters. I learned about barrage balloons (who knew?), air raid shelters and how the women and kids in a close knit community in South London coped with unimaginable burdens.I believe The Secret Shelter would be a great read for teens as well as those a bit younger. It's a part of history that shouldn't be forgotten."
4,Of shearwaters and edges,"In Talvikki Ansel's new book Jetty and Other Poems we enter a rugged and rocky world at the edge of the sea or pond. These are stern and precise poems marked by the craft that caught James Dickey's eye when he chose her first book as winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets. The poems here traverse valleys and disturbances, what's quiet and dangerous. They offer a kind of solitude that's as stark and clear as a woodblock print, but not without its meticulous joys. History, divinations, the daily inquiry, these poems seek for that thing to steer by which may be only ""the one pine on the coast."" ""The projecting jetty that keeps storms / from the market square"" protects us just long enough to watch the clam in the water glass blossom."
4,Great product!,I bought this product form Eforcity which provide a good after-sale services and fast shipping. This case is prefectly fit for my cell phone with a fat battery.Nextel i580 Swivel Holster w/ Belt Clip [OEM] NNTN6653A
4,Nicely built,This was bought to replace a similar product that could not last more than 18 month on the very bad pavement of Montreal. The first impressions are very positive but only time will tell if it can survive longer...
5,Buy it to read the Hamlin Garland story.,"This is an outstanding collection, even though the first story is really weak. Hamlin Garland's great story echoes ""Cold Mountain,"" with a soldier returning home from the Civil War to the woman he loves. Oddly, the editors said Garland was ""probably a minor talent."" Ever read ""Daughter of the Middle Border?"" Garland was not prolific, but he was definitely MAJOR."
2,Not for English learning German,"This dictionary must be exclusively for German speakers learning English, or was printed incorrectly as all text describing how to use, as well as phonetic guides are for German speaking people. Generally of little help for English speakers trying to learn German."
5,Comprehensive German Dictionary,"This dictionary is very comprehensive and, when used as a desk reference, it will have all the answers you are looking for. Do not attempt to bring this book in your backpack, however, because such an action will surely require a later visit to a chiropractor."
4,Looks good on car for hubs,"I got these for my 96 Maxima to add some style compared to the OEM Nissan hubs (least until I upgrade to rims) and it did the trick. My car looks much better with these on especially at night these babies shine. Of couses like other hubs they do tend to fall off but I've had mines for 7 months and they fell about 3-5 times ( at times the shop just put them back on the tires wrong). At this price its a bargin, at an auto place I've seen these priced at $40. Im actually going get another set simply because one of mine cracked when it fell off so Im going to replace it and the rest would just be extra just in case. Great pro-rims investment.."
1,So sad..,"After reading this review I thought I'd do some quick searches to learn more about the author before I bought it. I was surprised to learn that while the Backstreet Boys sold over 70 million copies, the record company still insisted that the band hadn't yet recouped their costs...I suppose we now know where the last B in this title comes from eh?? If you don't believe me, just do some quick net searches for ""Backstreet Boys recouped Pearlman"" and see what you find. While the author may have founded the concept, he certainly wasn't out on tour day in/day out, nor does he have to deal with the personal cost of fame at every turn. Greed is such a pathetic thing and turns great businessmen into criminals. I'm not suggesting that the author is a criminal, that's for society to judge..."
3,Misunderstood Entrepreneur?,"While there is no denying Lou Pearlman's business acumen and the hard work that allowed him to succeed as related in this book, this 250 pages is also annoyingly self-serving. He spends a fair amount of time justifing the lawsuits and some of his business practices, and explaining the broken professional/personal relationships with the Backstreet Boys and 'NSync. It all seems to come down to which side of the courtroom you are sitting on. Was he taking advantage of young naive performers or just trying to recoup his investments? The fact that he refers to these singing groups as ""brand names"" and compares them to Coke and Pepsi does not help his case. Still, can he be blamed for wanting to be very rich?If you follow these Ten Rules, will you become a billionaire like Lou Pearlman? Not very likely, but with that said, this book is full of interesting insights and stories, and is a fast and entertaining read."
3,A Cautionary Tale,"I wanted to know what value the book had BEFORE I purchased it. I watched Pearlman's story on CNBC's AMERICAN GREED and learned of this book. I figured this book can serve as a cautionary tale of how NOT to allow greed and ego undo the good you intended to do.I thought Pearlman was shrewd in his business career, with the potential to do good things. However, he became addicted to the limelight and being the Big Man on Campus. I felt his addiction to the spotlight played a significant role in his undoing.I'm assuming he has good rules in this book. The sad part was that his business practices undermined those rules."
5,Lou Pearlman reeks of genius!,"I think history will look kindly back on Mr. Pearlman. I get so tired of people saying he manipulated young men and their families in order to make a buck. So what? It's called capitalism, baby! And if you can't get that through your thick skull before you sign a contract -- then don't sign it! Yes, Pearlman would seem to be a greedy, duplicitous and nefarious character from us on the outside, but I'm sure there are many people, OK maybe not ""many"" ... but at least a few ... OK maybe ""few"" is overstating it. But I bet his gardener likes him on payday if you know what I mean.But let's get this straight, Pearlman was a branding genius in tight slacks and a bad combover. And no, that does NOT make him a bad guy. it's not about Pearlman, it's about music that seems as fresh today as it did when it was released and will definitely stand the test of time."
1,Not for a true crime fan,"I paid a lot more than I normally pay for a book because of the reviews about it. This should be under biography or history about the Old South. When the author stayed with the story about the crime it was very good. I was disappointed with this book due to the price and getting off the subject. The wife who was shot was a little to forgiving to be true, especially when seeing some of her personality traits in the book."
4,Nice monitor stand,"Very sturdy & secure. Because it is triangular, it is potentially unstable towards the long side of the triangle. I solved this by securing it to my desk. overall, it does what is designed to do and I do like it."
4,ALLSOP Stand Reveiw,"I like it, very easy to assemble,it works well for what I needed it for as to raise my monitor off my desktop. I just have one concern I really wish it could have been 3 to 4 inches taller than the five inches that it is; other than that it's perfect for me."
4,Corner Monitor Stands are hard to find,"This one fills the bill nicely. Except for the leg positioners, which are plastic, this stand is all metal and quite sturdy. I took some care in assembling it as the threaded part of the legs looked as if they might bend with too much torque, but now that it is fully assembled, it's bearing the load of my 22-inch monitor and a few other miscellaneous items without any problems.I looked for a corner monitor stand for quite some time and I kept coming back to this one. I don't care for it's looks but that's really subjective and I will dress it up in my own good time. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase and feel that it's a good value.Pros: Sturdy, All metal, reasonably priced for its quality.Cons: It's aesthetics may or may not be your cup of tea."
2,Gentle stand,"Legs should be screwed in to assemble this stand - a little more force and leg joint is broken (really cheap welding). Handle with care!:)I've just glued mine, bother not to return etc.Works as a stand so, nice ""Corner"" design."
2,Monitor stand,The stand does what I bought it for but both front legs are angled slightly inward. It stand and holds the monitor in the corner but the manufacturer and quality control is poor when you can;t make a leg straight. With this quality if should be much cheaper.
1,Shoddy construction,"Like another reviewer, one of the welded joints broke off when I was assembling the product. If the force of hand-screwing the leg into the joint is enough to break this thing, I can't imagine it safely supporting a computer monitor.Also - since this product is so large and heavy, it is more expensive to mail it back than to just accept the loss and move on. I'm so unhappy with this transaction, I don't think I'll ever buy something like this online again, unless the seller offers free return shipping."
5,A great read - captures the essence of a great rescue.,"Whitcomb does a great job of sorting out the complexities of a multi-faceted mission. Clausewitz called it the fog of war - this mission typified it. Excellent read. Joe Panza, Colonel USAF (Ret) Jolly Greens 1967-68."
5,great sword,My son got this sword 2 yrs ago(he is a fanatic)...it has been well used and is still in great shape. the foam is tough and my 9 mo. old nephew can not bite pieces out of it. i am buying another one before they are all gone!
3,Chesney live,"Kenny Chesney's high-energy shows would be virtually impossible to truly capture live. This does about as good as anyone could hope for, with a VERY tight band, and as live CDs go, is extremely enjoyable. I do have a problem with sound techs boosting crowd noise when words are ""spoken"" during the course of the song just for the purpose of trying to re-create a crowd's reaction. In some places on this CD, it's so blatantly obvious. You hear the crowd, then all of a sudden, it's like the crowd is instantly silenced. Did someone tell the crowd to shut up? Live shows don't happen that way; that's something that's done in a studio. Blissfully, it only happens a few times here. For the most part, this is a well-done live CD. Not the best I've heard, and not the best ""country"", but worth your money just the same."
5,Can't go Wrong with Kenny Chesney!!,"I have become a fan of Kenny Chesney a little over a year ago & absolutely love his music, so I decided to add one more CD to my Chesney music library. You actually start to feel like you are at the concert and jealous at the same time for not being there...Highly recommend this CD to any fan of country music and/or Kenny Chesney."
5,Great Energy!,I haven't been able to make it to any of the concerts and this CD allows me to imagine some of the energy that one feels at one of Kenny's concerts. I also really like the quitars and drums on this CD--better than studio. They seem to have more life. I'd love to see a Live #2 come out and then repackaged to make a double. We could call it Kenny's White Album. :>) (That's a Beatle's term for some of you that may be too young to know what I'm referring to.)
2,Disappointed...,Broke within 7 months with only a 90-day warranty. My husband didn't even use it daily. Going to purchase another brand next time as I believe it should have lasted for AT LEAST a year.
5,I'm speechless...,This complex system is so great and wonderous that character creation and development makes your character unique... this system is a must have... cool combats... awesome spell lists... makes AD&D look like child's play.
3,WS-60 Not quite up to par for center channel,"Let me start off by saying I am no audiophile but I do know good sound and have come to expect it. I purchased the WS-60 to replace an old polk center channel that had a blown tweeter and also because I now have an lcd tv and could use this slick design if I need to put it on the wall. I just wish the sound was as nice as it's look. In my opinion the sound is very tinny which I believe is a result of the metal enclosure and small speakers. This makes voice reproduction (essential in a center channel) very poor and voices sound like they are trapped in a metal building, not very realistic. I am going to use this as a back surround speaker in a 6.1 setup and opt for a center channel with bigger speakers and a wood enclosure to get bigger more realistic voice reproduction. As far as this speakers ability to be a front/rear channel speaker I cannot comment because I haven't heard it in that setup."
5,Very good center channel for surround sound,Have used a single Athena WS-60 speaker as center channel in surround setup for about three months. It is clear and powerful for movies and music. A sub-woofer is still needed for bass sounds.
4,Oh How Lovely!,"This was my first vibrator, and overall I'm happy with Doc's iVibe. Took me a couple tries to get off using it, but once you adjust the ""ears"" to properly rub you the right way, the sensation is fantastic.The pearls don't do really anything for me, but I enjoy how the entire toy skwirms and is jelly-like instead of rock hard.A great investment!"
3,"I didn't see stars, so I didn't give this thing 5.","I'm in a long distance relationship, and I have needs more often than I see my boyfriend, so this helps me out sometimes. It's alright, but i like a lot more clitoral stimulation than this thing provides. If you're more of a ""vagina girl"" so to speak, you'll probably like this a lot more than I do.The suction cup is also completely useless and doesn't stick to anything, no matter how flat the surface. Overall, I kind of wish I'd spent a little more on my vibrator."
1,Awful,"I had a similar modal to this that I bought back in 2007. It took 4 AA batteries. This one uses only 3 AA batteries, and there is a big difference. There aren't as many pearls in the middle as my old one either. The only reason I bought this one is because my old one has a short in it. But after using this once, and becoming frustrated, I just put up with my old one shorting out on me! lol. So don't waste your money!"
1,small disappointment,"This was a ""small"" disappointment. Rabitt vibration was decent but the rotating pearls which you don't have the option to turn off are very uncomfortable."
3,My opinion,This product is decent... I guess its one of thoes things you get what you pay for.. Its built kinda cheep.. Kinda feels like its gonna break and doesn't have enough power..it bogs down really bad when using.. Doesn't even work on low... :(.. But medium and high does the job.. If your looking for something cheap and hands free this is for you.. If your looking for high quality.. Go else where
4,Feels great,This feels great and has 3 settings. But the suction cup doesn't stick to anything! Which is disapointing because that's why I bought it.
4,Nice!,"This product has worked well for me for over a year now. Sometimes I do have trouble with the battery holder, if its not like positioned right it wont work. I like the way it moves and what it is made of...I would recommend it!"
3,meh,"The suction cup does NOT stick. It's bulky and rather unwieldy. If this is a rabbit, then i'll just go back to a normal vibe. not worth it."
1,This was plain stupid,"I don't understand what it is, but it seems like Hollywood can't do a good werewolf movie anymore. And with todays special effects and all the talented writers out their I don't know why. The last good one was about 3yrs. ago called ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" that had great effects and a good story. Since then their has been 1 called ""Werewolf"" and the best thing I can say about that is that it made for a great MST-3000 episode. One of the funniest of that great show. And now we get this. I can't even begin to say how dumb it was. Just trust me,if you are a fan of werewolf movies don't bother with this,go rent ""An American Werewolf in London"" or ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" or ""Bad Moon."" That was a good one too, but avoid this at all costs."
1,Horrible Customer Service,I have tried for over 2 weeks to get ahold of someone in Customer Service and Tecnical Support. I get a messgae that no one is available and leave a message. I have left 5 messages to no avail. I'm not even sure there is a real department receiving these call.My remote takes 5 minutes to work once i turn on the TV. There is a humming noise in the background. I have decided to return the tv. Let's hope I get my money back.
2,color wasn't too good,"I owned this TV for about 2 weeks. I made numerous adjustments to the color, and never could get it as vivid as I like. The color always looked flat, in my opinion. The darker colors didn't show much detail, either. I thought DVD playback looked good, but that wasn't enough of a reason for me to keep it. I returned it to the store I bought it from (it wasn't amazon.com). Plus, the remote control seemed to be quirky. Say I'd want to tune to channel 28. Channel 2 would come up, then channel 8, instead of channel 28."
4,Great TV for the price,"I was really impressed with the picture quality on this tv.I tried it with HD content, composite video and analog. The HD content was immaculate, the analog was surprisingly good, and the composite was very grainy, as I expected. The ""sleep"" feature on the tv is more complicated than it should be and requires the user to scroll through a couple of menus to get to (there is no button on the remote). The tv arrived packaged very well, and setup was a no-brainer. The only issue I've had so far is that the tv does not repsond to the remote for the first minute after it is turned on. Tech support was helpful and sent me a firmware upgrade but I havent had a chance to try it yet.Overall, I am thrilled with its sleek design, great picture quality and most of all, the price!"
3,Good product for the right reasons,"After doing some research, I figured I would plop down the cash for this TV. I use it in the bedroom which I have a PS2 hooked up to it and a directv high def reciever. The picture started out horrible when I used the regular Directv box, but after switching to the high def, its outstanding. No ghosting, no blur, just a nice solid picture. I also waited a month to write this review just so I got some good experience with it.Good--Price, amount of input options, picture is excellent when using HD.Bad--Speakers need to be detachable, not enough AV inputs, remote is craptacular, and the base doesn't come off for wall mounting???? (if you know how to remove the base, please pass on the info!)"
3,Good picture- forget about customer support,Customer support don't answer the phone numbers or return messages and customer support has not responded to my email.I found out the solution to the buzzing problem by looking at otherwebsites. This is to turn the backlight to bright.I've was unable to get 480p working. It turns out this is because you have to use component cables. I don't think this is anywhere in the documentation.I haven't been able to get DVI working which is especially frustrating because I spent sixty or seventy dollars on cables.I'm going to keep it but if I did it over I would pay a little more and get a supported product.
2,TVs okay - just hope it doesn't break,"I had the worst customer service experience of my life with Syntax. It has been more than three months since my original TV broke, and I still don't have a working replacement (original broke, replacement was already broken when I got it). Not one of my e-mails or voice messages were returned (left > 10). It takes forever to get through to customer service, and no one can help you when you get through. They keep transferring you to people who don't answer, leaving you with another message to leave that won't be responded to. I would never, ever buy anything from this company again. Trust me on this one, look elsewhere."
1,Bulky,A little big and bulky for the location I was attempting to install plastic rivets. Returned it for a refund.
2,"Good part, wrong application","I was replacing my struts on my 05 Subaru Outback, and wanted to top off my new struts with new mounts, but was forced to re-use my old mounts. Due to the mount studs not matching up with my car(too small)."
2,Early Tony Martin work,"This album features ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin in his early years!!! He does a great job on vocals here, but the music isn't metal (yet even rock), and that's what killed it for me. It is pop music. The only GREAT track is ""Black Night/Strange Kind Of Woman"", but it's a Deep Purple cover. Better than the original, IMO. Otherwise, buy it only if you are a serious, big time Martin-era Sab fan. Otherwise, you will be totally dissapointed. Then again, this is out of print now, so it's rare! P.S. Forbidden is about 100 times better, but as I said, I'm a HUGE T.M. fan and I'll buy anything he makes! Check out ""The Cage"". It's available here, and it's a must have. Can't...stop...listening...to...it, must....play...it...again......buy....""The...Cage""...with..Martin....and Dario Mollo...now.."
5,"Absolutely, wonderfully amazing!","When I first acquired this book, I sneaked a peak at the contents quickly thumbing through the pages and radomly reading a portion of the print here and there. I knew immediately that I had stubbled on something special...and powerful. Ms. Dyer's work is amazingly insightful, beautifully articulate and wholly artistic. It is truly a journey of heart and soul. I for one am thankful to the author for choosing to share her amazing gift and journey with others. It will touch your heart...it really will!"
3,Saxon-style Swedish melodic metal,"2003's Don't Think Tomorrow is the debut album from Swedish melodic hard rock/metal band Pain and Passion. The band plays a fairly straightforward brand of traditional heavy metal with a decidedly Swedish sense of melody. I suppose Evidence One and Pretty Maids are this band's peers, but Bjorn Asking's vocals remind me of Saxon's Biff Byford.Don't Think Tomorrow is a perfectly decent melodic hard rock/metal album, but it's really nothing you haven't heard before. The thing that kept occurring to me when spinning this disc is that I really needed to listen to more Saxon. That's probably not a good sign for the band, which has since changed its name to Zero Illusions.Sorry, but I'm just not moved enough to give Pain and Passion a very high recommendation. If you're a major fan of Swedish hard rock and metal, and you run across a cheap/used copy of Don't Think Tomorrow, by all means give it a try. Maybe you'll get more out of it than I did."
3,"Eh, it served the purpose","I received the wrench quickly, and it was needed badly to get my truck back on the road. The use I had for it was for measuring preload on the pinion bearing of a differential.Quality seemed decent, but I had an issue with mine. The pointer didn't point to zero, and couldn't be adjusted to do so. I tried flexing the torzue shaft out to 60in.lbs to get it to ""zero"", but it would still return to show about 4 inch pounds when not loaded, so I had to add 4 to my reading. Problem is, the preload method requiring a ""rolling"" torque reading, meaning it had to be read during rotation, not the breaking torque reading, which would be the amount needed to start rotation. Getting a reading between 10-12 ""/# and subtracting 4 is simple math, but a pain to have to keep up with when it should have read correctly."
4,Accurate Tool,A good thing about this torque wrench is that it does not need caliberation and it will keep it's accuracy for a long time. I would use it for tightening bicycle parts or the bolts on auto oil pans.
3,"OK, but doesn't measure Newton-Meters","This torque wrench works OK but it has a major limitation: it doesn't measure Newton-Meters. Yet most small bike parts seem to be specified by manufacturers in terms of Newton-Meters. Instead this wrench has inch-pounds and centimeter-kilograms. Maybe I'm buying the wrong bike parts (I buy Ritchey, Shimano, Campagnolo, SRAM, etc.) but I've never seen torque requirements of centimeter-kilograms for any commercial bike part. It looks like this tool design is old and Park hasn't updated it, though an update has been overdue for at least five years now. Your only recourse with this tool is to mark up the tool face with NM or keep a calculator around when using it."
4,Fairly consistent,"I've been using more and more carbon components and thought I should abide by the warning labels to avoid over torquing. Bought this, and it has served me well. I'm still not quite sure in the long term how accurate the deflection will be as over time, the properties of the metal from being repeatedly bent would likely change. But considering I'm not a full time mechanic and the use is intermittent, it would likely be years before that ever became a concern."
1,i do not like this a-ha album,"EU REALMENTE NAO GOSTEI DESTE ALBUM BY A-HA, SO SE SALVOU AFAIXA ""LIFELINES"" . COMO O ALBUM MEMORIAL BEACH ESTE NAO VAIESTOURAR. E UMA TRISTEZA PORQUE DEPOIS DE FAZER UM ALBUMCOMO O MINOR EARTH MAJOR SKAY, QUE PARA MIM E O MELHOR ALBUMDO A-HA. INFELISMENTE LIFELINES EU NAO RECOMENDO."
2,Out of fuel,"If you're hoping for a repeat of ""Minor Earth|Major Sky"" on this round, you're out of luck. It's not even ""Stay On These Roads"". What is happening here is that apparently, Pal Waaktaar is focusing more on his band SAVOY than on A-ha. His few contributions are staggering here (and so few as compared to nearly writing ALL of ""Memorial Beach""). The music of this album is also a bit adrift and a bit too technological. It's almost a regression for this group who was turning out wonders of tunes from 1990-2000. To hear the first song 'Lifelines' you'd think it was a continuation of greatness, however 'You Wanted More' drags it down. 'Forever Not Yours' brings it back up, only to be dragged down by 'There's A Reason For It'. After the last down here, it never comes back up until 'White Canvas' which is the last high point. 3 highs out of 13 doesn't make for a great enjoyable listen. I'd advise this one to you only if you are a completist."
4,"True, it's not great, but let's be reasonable please....","I would first like to say that I think this album is perfectly fine, if not perfectly very good. They may be moving toward a more Depeche Mode/New Order edge, but hey - WHAT AN EDGE!!! If you like A-Ha, get this CD - it's only money - music is enjoyable forever, dollars go by so quickly!!! Don't listen to us!!Secondly, can I please reply to ""A music fan from Watervliet""?! Your review is fine, to each his own I say. Can I just say that 'making it in America' is not the be all and end all of musical success. If you haven't seemed to have noticed, some of the most acclaimed and important artists around the world are not even known inside the US, that in itself is saying something. Can I also state, crap is all I can hear coming out of America at the moment, so let's bring on the Norwegians I say!!!!!This is a breath of fresh air....and isn't that what we need at the moment."
4,Revised review. I gets better the more you listen!,I recently gave this CD 2 1/2 stars and I think I may have spoken too soon. 3 1/2! I had only listened it to the disc twice and think I was expecting Minor Earth Major Sky 2. It is definitely not MEMS2 but it's strong in it's own right. I still don't like the fact that there's less collaboration but the songs become more accesible with each listen. Morten vocals are outstanding and with repeated listens you hear more intricacies within the songs than I originally thought. Lyrics don't really stand out but that's not a deal breaker. As a whole the album is solid. It's varied enough that the album provides moodswings as you listen to it which I like. Although it is a little slow towards the end. A-ha has written better songs and made better albums but that's not the point now is it.
4,More A-Ha,"Please don't expect anything revolutionary from the dear old A-ha. They're still the same: (almost) young looking, nicely playing and singing, and able to create really beautiful and memorable melodies.Still some tunes are more impressive, and at times simply astonishing; among those are Forever Not Yours, Lifelines, A Little Bit, Dragonfly, and Turn The Lights Down. Most of these have chances to get in some charts. The rest of the material is probably not much worse, and may be appreciated not only by the die-hard fans of the Norwegian band.The news itself that they go on, don't stop is already good and promising enough. A-ha are always a chance to stop, relax, remember the 80's, and enjoy the beautiful, slightly dark, and fragile music they play, and we'll be looking forward to more news from Norway."
1,Worst text book i've ever seen!,"Where do i start. the MANY TYPOS, not enough information, bad layout, not enough examples and very complicated problems. not a clue on how to solve poor explanation... a lot of words & you don't get enough information on the topic at the end! & for that price, are you kidding me? literally; THE WORST i have ever seen."
5,Use of Book for Litigation Support,"My firm provides litigation support services to attorneys. We found Dr. Bedient's book to be very useful both as a reference and as a means of educating our clients who typically have limited technical capabilities in the area of groundwater hydrology. The book covers a variety of topics, all in sufficient detail, I believe. It is well written and organized, for easy reference. If the authors write a sequel, I suggest additional case studies that discuss some of the environmental ""mysteries"" out there!"
5,HOPE is for everyone,"This book was written for Parkinson's People and is a must read for anyone with PD and their families. I loved the book so much I have given copies to family and friends who don't have PD. Why? Because HOPE has something to teach us all about living with adversity (presented here in the form of chronic illness) in a way that builds on our strengths while learning to adapt to uninvited change.Especially strong are Hal's ingsights about relationships: life partners, family, physician, and friends. I literally could not put this book down and read it in one sitting."
1,What happen??,"Kraco made some good matts, ordered 2 to match my front. One was thick durable, the other was flimsy and cheap. They look identical yet one is hard rubber the other feels like a laytex condom. 5 stars for one, 1 for the other."
5,Sasha is Hot,"Sasha is hot she always looked hot when she goes out. Meygan, yasmin, cloe, and Jade is hot too expesally jade she looks sexy with her hair like that. But, still sasha is the best and I'm not just saying that because i'm a sasha love. bratz rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,NATIONAL LEUKEMIA FOUNDATION,"""STEP OUT TO HELP OUT(tm) for each doll purchased, MGA will make a donation to 'National Children Luekemia Foundation'"" (quote from [...])Yeahhhh!! Well done MGA :-) okay does this encourage you to support a very worthy cause, people??BTW Bratz rock. This line is cute i think, i dont own any YET but I've seen them in stores."
3,NO SHE ISNT!!!!!!,"OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sasha is NOT the prettiest doll in THIS collection! (prettiest in Pop Starz though)Heres all the step out (NOT SO. GOD!) in order from best to worst!Cloe (THE BEST ONE.....YET!!!! AND I DONT LIKE CLOE) Meygan (AWSOME) jADE (COOL) YASMIN. AND LAST AND LEAST, SASHA!"
5,"Yoga philosopy, the details","Eliade researched for this book, while staying with Surendranath Dasgupta in India, who was the formost scholar of indian philosophy and thelogy at his time. Eliade meticulously analyzed the indian scriptures and commentaries on sankhya and yoga and presents yoga as a huge, complex and precise system of practice and philosphy with the goal of kaivalyam (libration). This book is a lighthouse in the present time of publishing as much as the printing press can print."
3,"fun, but no 'Preppy Handbook'","I liked the book. it's a little simplistic, like ""the preppy handbook"" without the polish, but that's kind of what I expect from an anthropological study of something that's still happening. yetties (and bobos as well, though they're distinct) are basically real phenomena. if you're in the industry (as most of us on the list are), you won't actually *learn* anything, but it's an amusing & harmless read.if you're not in the industry, it's the best stab I've seen at somebody writing a book that my mom might understand about what kind of people are in the industry. (I read it and gave her a copy while I was home for thanksgiving; she's found it amusing and interesting in the ways I expected her to.)"
3,Clarification on What This Book Is,"This book is the generic flight manual for the B-24D, dated 15 September 1942. The H model on the book's cover photo was a poor choice (or ignorance) by Periscope. When I purchased it I was looking/hoping for something covering the later and more widely used G, H or J models. This book does have some good information in it, and if nothing else gives the reader an appreciation for how un-ergonomic and purely utilitarian combat aircraft were at the time. Crew comfort and efficiency were certainly not worth much in the designers' eyes. But if you are looking for some good details on operation of all the aircraft's systems including armament and interior layout, this isn't it."
3,A thorough and fair review,"A fair coverage of the major issues of professional and ethical conduct confronting attorneys. Still, at times a little too cute for its own good. But overall, helpful guidance."
5,The BEST MUSIC I ever heard,"I used to listed to the BONEY M during my young days (in 70's, 80's) when my uncle plays in his TapeRecorder. That time all their albums come in cassattes. Now I bought this CD while I was surfing for something else and remembered my young days.If you like POP-ROCK musics, just buy it ... it is worth buying."
3,Not bad -- but not among McMurty's best.,"After the twin classics ""Where'd You Hide the Body,"" and ""It Had to Happen,"" (his two best albums), his fifth album is a bit of a letdown. In fact, the best song, ""Rex's Blues,"" is a cover of a old Townes Van Zant tune. Songs like ""I Only Want to Talk to You,"" and ""Every Little Bit Counts,"" are good, but only hint at the lyrical power of which McMurtry is capable. If you are looking to introduce yourself to his music, start with the previous two albums I mentioned and hear this fine artist at his best."
4,First Time Listener ........,"This is the first James McMurty album I have listened to, so I cannot compare it with any other albums he has done. I thought this album was very good musically and his lyrics are exceptional and poetic. Some of his songs are funny and satirical, such as the song about dealing with TSA at the airport. We have all been through that experience. I will have to try another album by him in the immediate future since this was an enjoyable experience."
3,Great if you want to do drills all the time,"I have mixed thoughts on this book. First it is a ton of great information and drills you can use to practice all jazz patterns. The downside is that the theory explanations leave a lot to be desired, if they have any at all in some sections. Plus all the book is comprised of is drills. I guess if you want to do drills, then this book is great. But if you're looking for more theory and application (like jamming) then buy a music theory book (see my other reviews) and Aebersold play-alongs."
2,Patterns for patterns' sake,"Useful to demonstrate how patterns are devised, but not how to apply them to a musical situation. Those who use this as a practice book are left to figure that out for themselves.Far more useful for a beginning student would be examples of how scale/patterns are musically applied to a tune/chord progression."
4,Great detail of mental challenges,"Overall, a very great good detailing her Journey. There are not many stories/accounts of day-to-day events, but more of an overall description of her mood and feelings during the journey. I felt that too much time was spent on the political message describing the treatment of the Aboriginal people. Worth the effort though, as it is a short book that tells a very unique story."
5,Fascinating story,"It was few years ago. I was in college back home in Poland where I spent most of my time reading & dreaming about Down Under. When I grabbed the book from the library's shelf I knew that it will change my life forever.I've always wanted to go there and cross the country from north to south and east to west. Davidson's powerful story gave me a courage to realize that my dreams are likely to come true. Even though I made a stop in the United States, where I've been living over 2 years now, I'm on my way to the beautiful place, to my place, my idea fix - Australia. And if it wasn't for her personal struggle I woludn't even imagine myself going there. I'm on my way..."
5,Great for the explorer in everyone!,"Let me first say that this should be required reading for young girls. I think Robyn summed it up best when she said, ""The two important things that I did learn were that you are as powerful and strong as you allow yourself to be, and that the most difficult part of any endeavour is taking the first step, making the first decision."" Having been on a few 'mini-adventures' with my husband, this rung so true in my ears that I had to quote it in my review. How many of us, especially young women, are afraid to take that first step? This is a great tale of the human struggle to overcome fear of the unknown and accomplish a deeper sense of self in a beautiful land of mystery. You must get a copy of this book and go along on Robyn's journey.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
3,Too much about training camels,"Granted, Robyn Davidson's book ""Tracks"" is a good read, but it emphasizes too much her preparing to go on the trip, learning how to train the camels, ride 'em, etc. She doesn't even set out on the trip until after the halfway point in the book, which I found ludicrous. Yes, it took her almost 2 years to prepare and train the camels, so obviously for Robyn it was a big part of her life and gained a lot of attention. But the reader doesn't care for that. Someone should have edited the book better. Otherwise, Robyn's writing is splendid, beautiful, and she deserves to be credited for that. Very good writer."
2,Satire,"She spends most of the book abusing metaphors to describe the scenery.The satire comes in the juxposition of Aboriginals and camels.Intermixed with deploring the way Aboriginal people are treated, she beats her domesticated camels with a chain until she is exhausted.When she comes across a wild camel that has not be subjugated, the she must shoot it dead, for her own safety."
2,Probably more than you ever wanted to know about camels...,"The beginning third of this book, in which Ms. Davidson is preparing for her trip, really should have been cut in half. I thought she'd never get going.Once her journey begins, there are a few interesting adventures interspersed with many excruciatingly long passages of introspection and whining.But the main reason I gave this book a mere two stars is because I really disliked the author--she came across as aself-centered nutcase who survived through sheer luck and the help of others, rather than because of her intelligence or survival skills. She is definitely not in the same category of women as Jane Goodall or Diane Fossey."
2,Confusing and boring,"Even though this book did have a powerful plot i thought it was flat out boring. The subject change confused me a lot. One minute she was talking about cammels and the next she was talking about something totaly opposite. It was very hard to finish this book. I give the author credit for acutally having the courage to do that and i think the book has a lot of girl power to it, but i didnt like the way she wrote it."
4,THE GUESS WHO,"AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, I FORGOT JUST HOW GOOD THIS GROUP WAS"
3,big superhero game fan,"This isn't much like the spiderman games that i'm used to, but it is definitely a lot of fun. Good storyline for a fighting game. The single player is challenging (but beatable) and uses most if not all the characters. There are plenty of characters, and most are different and have unique powers. There are two versus modes: against the computer or against a friend. The computer is pretty easy to beat. Each character has it's own pros and cons. Another thing i like is that the character levels aren't the same (anybody remember super smash bros?). In most games there are a lot of different people but they're mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves. In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end.I actually got bored and a little dissappointed after playing this a couple of days, but a little while ago i started playing again and it is awesome. recommended for comic book fans."
3,A Novices Opinion,"I am not a hardcore gamer, but I am a hardcore MARVEL fan. That said, this game desperatly needs a optional difficulty setting. The basic levels in ""story mode"" are easy enough, but the ""bosses"" know all the secret moves and aren't afraid to use them, meanwhile it gets really old trying to fight the same character for an hour because they keep slaughtering you. 2nd main complaint is they list all 18 characters in the booklet that are available to play, most of them you have to unlock. The promise of Daredevil, Venom and many others is unatainable unless you beat a considerable amount of characters.The game play and design are spectacular though, aside from it not being very welcome to novice gamers. Hopefully the codes will be out soon enough."
2,coooool............but then again,"it was a really cool game but after you beat it theres nothing to do.the characters are really cool but the destructible stuff is a third enemy.the story missions are to similar to one another.the inperfects are just weirder versions of super heroes.like brigade=thing and hazmat = wolverine. get what im saying and the ones that dont copy a hero(which is none)there so stupid.oh and paragon and the wink are in everyway the same.i think you should with ultimate spider man instead.(its a far better game!)P.S.SPIDERMAN,VENOM AND IRON MAN RULE!!YA!!!!ROCK ON!!!!!GREEN DAY RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S.S.the wink = nightcrawler"
3,It's okay,"You get to play as Venom and Iron man, as well as several new characters. The game has profanity, not recommended for children. It's also kind of dark. But the storyline is decent, and it's fun to fight all the aliens. The fight scenes show the whole setting, you don't get to watch the characters go at it close-up. I still haven't beaten it, but then it always takes me a while to beat a game."
1,Overhyped,"Well, I bought this game, Xmen Legends 2, and Ultimate Spiderman.After beating Ultimate Spiderman (GREAT GAME!!), then trying this game, I must say I'm dissappointed.The intro movie in story mode was good, but overall so far the game is horrid. Spiderman telling someone he kicked their ass? What the hell? Spiderman doesn't even use the word Ass. They give characters like Spiderman a hard edge that he doesn't have/need.I want to play as Venom but apparently you have to unlock that to all hell. Dissappointing if you ask me. And I heard after you unlock the characters you can't even save it.You have to hold R1 to use Wolverine's claws? Uh, those are like a default power and stuff!Spiderman going into a RAGE?Uh have these guys ever read the comics? Spiderman doesn't throw stingers. Ben Reilly did.If you're a comic fan. Don't pick this game up. EA should stick to sports games. Stay away from this game. It sucks."
5,It was just the right gift.,It arrived on time and was well packaged. It was so easy to oder right from home. Our grandson just loves it.
4,This game was fun,This game had cool characters and a different story line. It was challenging and fun.
2,Don't Bother!,"Like many reviewers have already said, MARVEL NEMESIS is nothing but a button-mashing fighting game. Not fun and very repetitive! If you are looking for a super hero type game stick with either the X-MEN LEGENDS or MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE. At least those games are entertaining."
3,"Love this game, but whats with the price?","84 dollars? And that's not even plus shipping. I'm sorry, but who EVER thinks that selling this game for this price is a good idea needs to take a walk in the real world for an hour or so. I love the character designs and combat style. Probably the best Marvel fighting game I ever played. But after being out for years, this game should be about 10 dollars, maybe 20"
1,Get Spawn for Dreamcast instead,"Marvel Nemesis is a very boreing game. There are only 2 attack methods, the X button to punch, and the Circle button to grab.The graphics are average, there is nothing about the graphics that makes it stand out from other games.If you want a fighting game with comic book characters, your money is better spent on Spawn for Dreamcast. It's a similar game where you can throw objects and find weapons in the environment. But it's a LOT MORE FUN than this Nemesis game !"
5,OH hell yes!,"Funk, techno & a tiny bit o' rap. Great CD! I mean just FANTASTIC. Fun & alive. It moves. Get yer dance on People!"
4,Atlantis in America,If you love the mysterious goings on on Earth and beyond you'll love this book! The crystal skulls and there enchanting dicovery will make you want to expolore more about this amazing reality.
4,A missed opportunity?,"The fourth Doctor, along with Sarah and Harry are presented with the opportunity to destroy the Dalek at the time of their creation. Are they up to the task? The Dalek have caused the death of millions, if not billions of lives. Surely their destruction would be one of the biggest victories for all of intelligent life everywhere. And yet, what of the good that is caused by their evil as long-time enemies band together against the ultimate threat that is the Daleks. You know the Doctor will have the opportunity to destroy the Daleks, the question is, will he take it?Another plot driven novelization of the long running (and recently revived) TV series. Not much in the way of insights into the characters thoughts, but as usual a well told, easy to read story. A quick read, provides a couple hours of fun entertainment."
4,"This concerns only ""After Magritte""","Tom Stoppard here tries to create a totally magrittian world.As for the visual part, it is easy since Magritte was a painter. Chaotic, illogical, absurd visual elements and characters. Some elements are moved to create new absurd tableaux, even when they are apparently the results of logical movements.It is trickier to do the same with the dialogue of the play. He uses confusing words. He uses absurd language about an absent character that is described and interpreted in all kinds of ways by the various characters at various moments.But what about the plot ? Stoppard throws two cops into the tableau and they are so logical that they are entangled into absurd logical lines and come to absurd conclusions. The world becomes both kafkaian and orwellian, though it remains a comedy, or even a farce.Brilliantly done. Some details in the text are only visual, and would be hard to vocalize, for example the pun, on lute- loot .Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Love Liebrecht's literary style,"I'm not a lover of short stories, but Savyon Liebrecht has written a collection of Israeli short stories that disabused me of that notion.She creates full characters and plots in eloquent, flowing style with so few words that it's astonishing. Her strong female characters come to life and literally jump off the pages.A good travel book since each vignette is only 15-20 pages enabling you to stop and start quickly without missing a beat. Highly recommended."
5,"affirming, inspiring and funny","This happy little book is filled with reflections, wisdom and wit about women. It is uplifting and affirming. The stories, quotes and quips are both serious and playful. It caused me to laugh at myself and lighten up, as well as, to honor the women in my life who have influenced me in many positive ways."
5,Excellent book for non-native speaker,"I have been in the USA for over 15 years and currently work as an engineer. Even though I work with American co-workers every day, I still found this book very helpful!"
4,Good reference,"Overall, it is quite ok. It might be better to add somc colors to it. I learned more idioms from this book. The dialog is easy to follow. Excercises are very helpful. After you complete the whole book, next is to figure it out how to say it correctly with the right pronunciation which is the hard part of learning English as second language."
5,clearly presented ideas with well built and interesting workouts,this book really helps non-americans very much in learning the slang of native speakers. very interesting and useful in all aspects of learning english of USA
5,It's been a while,This song is the best other than waste. I really like Staind. They are the best band in the world!
1,Disappointing Offering From A Fine Group,"Found ""Celebrating Christmas"" to be not of the caliber of ""For All You've Done"" or the TV Shows. Too ""Hip-Hoppy"", too ""Boy-Bandy"" for me -- and not enough Darlene. Help yourself, if you prefer those sounds, but if you're looking for more of ""For All You've Done"", recommend you move on -- there's some, but nowhere near a complete album."
4,Great single from Outkast,"Outkast scored a hit with ""Elevators"", a laid-back track with a very catchy chorus. The beat in Elevators is very hypnotic and funky, more so than any other beat on ""ATLiens"". This was Outkast's biggest hit since Player's Ball, and it's obvious why. The flow of Big Boi and Dre on this song cannot be matched anywhere else and the chorus contains some great wordplay. Be sure to pick up ""ATLiens"" if you like this song"""
4,Real Good Song,while I like there First Two Albums a Great Deal I think when it's all said&done about Outkast they are probably One of the Baddest Singles Acts in Rap/Hip-Hop Ever to me.that isn't a Bad thing because it takes alot of Talent to be able to pull that off.this Song was Cool&it works.
5,"A ""must"" for San Francisco Bay Area gardeners.","This beautifully organized book provides an easy-to-follow guide for establishing butterfly, bird, and insect habitats in your own garden. Host plants, nectar plants, and food sources (both native and non-native) including annuals, perennials, shrubs, trees, and vines are listed for both butterflies and birds. Maintenance of the habitat garden is detailed with specific suggestions. Additional sections explain the importance of encouraging beneficial insects, the beauty and role of ponds in the garden, and special advice on ""how to"" start your own habitat garden. Color photographs provide a visual guide while spot illustrations and quotations provide inspiration and encouragement. A ""must"" for any Bay Area gardener."
4,Likeable,"I am a big fan of Sharyn McCrumb's ballad series which deals with the folklore of the Appalachian hill country in east Tennessee, so I am familiar with it and love it. I truly enjoyed the conversations and loved Fever's comments throughout the book, however, I was apparently not as enthralled as others were. It was a good book, and I did enjoy it, but for me, it dragged at times. That said, I will probably read another Fever Devlin mystery because I enjoyed the verbiage, but I just wasn't as excited about this novel as some reviewers."
3,what might have been,"Although now split-up, Cable still have a lot to offer. This album is more pop orientated than their previous ones but is still head and shoulders above the majority of other pop/rock outfits."
2,Not the book I thought it was!,"I had gotten a book from the children's library many times when my daughter was a toddler, more than 30 years ago. I remembered it being ""The Cereal Box"" by STEVEN KELLOGG, but a deep search through all of Kellogg's books gave me to believe I had the wrong author. Based on the reviews of this book, which call it magical, thought-provoking and WORDLESS, I believed I had found the book at last, and ordered an out-of-print library copy for my grandchildren. I arrived today and is NOT the book that the two reviewers describe! (I realize now that one of the reviewers is actually trying to review a DIFFERENT McPhail book, called ""OH NO GO"".) Instead it is a rather dull, wordy, pedestrian picture book about a kid who imagines finding silly prizes in his cereal box. I'll send it my grandkids, because *I* certainly don't want it, but the search continues for the book of my fading memories."
1,This was sold Amazon Prime as new and is used. Beware!,I am so upset - nowhere in the product description does it say this is USED. And it's USED and not in good condition!Buyer BEWARE. I've heard horror stories about buying toys and kid's books on Amazon but this is my first time getting burned.YUCK.
4,A charming story,"Katie Fforde writes delightful stories about nice people. I was feeling particularly down one day (had just visited a much-loved family member who was dying of cancer) and needed something light and happy to read, so I plucked this book off my TBR shelf and settled down in my favorite chair. From the first word, I was immediately carried away into Fforde's fictional world. Nell is a lovely heroine--the kind of woman I would enjoy knowing. It was fun to read about her life because I knew that no matter how serious the problems were that she encountered, all would be well in the end. This is a great story told in Fforde's lighthearted style with both skill and charm. You'll enjoy it."
1,This is bad.,"Lisa Marie Presley can't sing. No matter how hard she tries to, it is just not good at all. I wouldn't buy this again for any of my friends, relatives or strangers...it is just not worth the money. Maybe if it was $1 or $0.50 I'd think about it."
4,Give it/her a chance,"Now I am hip-hop, R&B, neo-soul when it comes to music but I sometimes venture out of the box when I like something. I like ""Lights Out"" the song and the video caught my eye and I definately said Sheryl Crow with more rock & roll. I know 35 is old to be getting into the music game (tank) but I think she needed the maturity to take the slings and arrows that might come her way.Let her stand on her own and don't mention, you know who, and you'll agree there is talent there that should be allowed to develop and mature. If Janet Jackson can break away from her families image, Lisa Marie can make people let go of her dad's fame and allow her to have her own name."
3,Question about a song,"Can anyone tell me if the song ""In the Ghetto"" with Lisa Marie and Elvis singing together is on a CD and what the name of the CD is. I would like to order it if available."
2,Lisamarie Presley needs a song writer that can sell her voice.,"Let's face it, Lisa does ...well, ok with singing. It isn't note worthy though. She sings with to much monotone, and even strained in most songs. I want to reach for the Zoloft, or call off a movie date.First, she needs to lower the music, and allow people to actually hear HER. She doesn't have to be like her father, she just needs to be really good. A new song writer could really help with some new catchy higher notes, and less strain. The songs she nows sings, all sound the same. No upbeat. Her music doesn't make you soar,want to dance, or listen while you work, or sing along. Something wrong with that???? Frankly I was rooting for her. I will still wish her well."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"As a long-time Walker Percy fan, I was initially attracted to this book to once again be reminded of Percy's brilliance. I was not disappointed as there is plenty of Percy. Professor Lawler has drawn upon the Moviegoer's Binx Bolling, the telescope metaphor, and more for us Percy devotees. The book provides new insights into Percy that continue to surprise me. Beyond Percy, this wonderful book draws upon classical philosophy, Aquinas, and actually makes natural law accessible to help remind us all that we are indeed ""strangers in a strange land."""
2,does not play correctly in some players,"does not play correctly in some players, skips and some were defective before even adding anything on them. as i said before this used to be a really good company at one time.plus the packaging looks generic."
1,TDK discs problematic,"Previously used Memorex, Verbatim discs with few to no problems. Many TDK discs start to skip or cause ""unable to read"" messages in my PC and my PS2 right toward the ends of movies. Been having to see many movies over to see what happens. Bad. Stay away."
4,"staked pain"" by tolbert","a richly detailed novel of the texas frontier , on and about, the civil war and it's afteramth. a number of historical chaters, from gen. sherman to comanche chiefs are part of the exciting experiences of a young man, of mixed bloood, whose comanche mother, and white father, gives him a unique view of the comanche empire, and thetexans who encounter it. he is a man of skills, a valued gun smith, who is admired by both nations, comanche/kiowa, and tejanos, for his abilities, and his brave loyal character. the comanches admire his thrist for vegeance for the death of his mother by ""blue coat' officers, and the texans, and blue coats for his abilities to communicate, and persuade the comanches and kiowas to a more peaceful way. plenty of adventures, and a very sympathetic view of the coamches, whose scalp lifting busines, and kidnapping of whites for ransom, seem like a rasonable way of dealing with these invaders. give it a try and you'll wish you were a comanche in the 1870's!"
5,Held up well on our flights,We purchased two of these carry-on bags before our trip to Hawaii. We were amazed at how much they held. There are lots of pockets to store small items or to keep items separated. The bags held up well to airport handling. We were impressed and would highly recommend this product.
4,"Great value, lt weight, no suit rack","This is a great value and a pleasure to wheel and carry. It's 1/3 lighter than the otherwise excellent but more expensive Travel-Pro. Well made, apparently (I've only used it for two trips so far). Only drawback--it doesn't have the neat suit rack that the Travel-Pro has, but I can fold the jacket pretty well without one."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I'm amazed by the many glowing reviews here for these suitcases.In a nutshell, these bags are well designed, but the engineering does not live up to the design.We purchased two 29"" and one trolley tote. Immediately there was a problem with the telescoping handles on the 29 inchers. They felt flimsy when extended, and to return them to the closed position, a button had to be pushed ""just so"" or they remained in the locked position. That was an irritation at the start.Small locks were included for security (I suppose), and they were a joke.While the bags look great, they suggest the quality of Chinese manufacture from about 1990. Having read other reviews here, I agree that it's only a matter of time before disaster strikes with these bags.Hopefully only as I'm wheeling up to the front door of my house, post-trip... ."
2,Very dated,Very disappointed as the book was not useful and not up to today's standards and best practices for professionally written resumes.
2,Unrealistic and not very exciting,"If you like characters which have depth and which do not think that it is the good place for that, even of the middle of a battle (war), forget this book. If you like SM, forget it too."
2,poorly made product...,"Bought this for my friend's dog as a christmas gift. Gift wrap was torn apart, food&water bowl leaks, bakpack was ripped... I was very disappointed. I was glad that I didn't have to pay full price, but not sure if it's still worth $50 I paid for..."
1,HUH?,Used ours one time and the waterbowl ripped and the lease broke....i thought Mt. Smith made better products than this...i will think hard before purchasing another Mt Smith product
4,Great Pack for My Dog,"Durable, easy to fit to my dog, good storage, and nice looking. What else can I say? My dog loves it and gets stoked to wear it and work it every time we go on short or long day hikes!"
2,Not Happy,"The backpack is great however the company that it came from (ebags) does not carry this actual item description. I expedited the product as it was needed by a certain timeline and I only received the backpack, no bowls, sleeping bag or leash. Upon contacting ebags, I was informed that the description was outdated and that they do not carry all the items in the description. However, I was welcome to return the product minus the shipping fees. I paid almost half the cost of the item for shipping costs to receive it quickly and they were not going to refund it!! I will never do business with ebags again!"
3,Chessie Figurine,"After some initial questions, the seller was wonderful to work with and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from Jake's Dog House again. Thank you."
5,Not just for boys!!,This book is a GREAT pop-up book. My 3-year-old twin daughters fell in love with this book in speech therapy and I was more than happy to finally find a copy of it here at Amazon.com!! Highly recommend for any little ones.
3,Great for beginners,"this instrument is great for the new learners, aspecially childern, but I found since or if you have experience in playing and getting back into it, you may want a more expensive horn, (so you won't have to buy another like I'm going to do).Johnnie Waller"
2,Not The best Trumpet,"We received the product on-time, however the oil container had leaked inside the Trumpet box, and it smelled real bad. We had to leave the box in the sunshine for almost a week, and still it smells bad.As for the trumpet itself, after a few lessons at school, one of the keys keeps getting stuck, and has to be manually pulled out to the normal position."
1,Taking back the runes,"There is a movement happening, as the previous reviewer implies, for Northern Heathens to speak out against the exploitation of their sacred traditions by New-Age cultural pirates.I was once told by a Native American that the most frustrating thing to him was seeing his traditions parodied by buckskin wearing New-Age gurus, who really had no idea of the culture they were stealing from.This is just how Heathens feel about Blum's work. The runes are held sacred by many Northern traditions, and this is yet another book that cashes in on runes as a popular vehicle to carry the author's real message.Surely, we can talk about relationships without bringing runes into it."
5,"Trash: Good Girls, Bad Boys",I love this book! This is the first book in my life that I have not been able to put down. I cannot wait to read the series over again. Cherie Bennett is my favorite author and I am going to read other books by her as well. I highly recommend this book. Especially for teenagers because I really think that people could relate to it. I also recommend other books by Cherie Bennett.
2,"Ok for medical professionals, but not worth it for pregnant women.","This book has a lot of good information for medical professionals about starting to use birth balls in their practices; however, it had next to no good information for an expectantant mother to use in labor preparation."
4,Fantasia on Christmas Carols,I only listened to the Fantasia on Christmas Carols in depth at this moment in time. Sir Thomas Allen is superb in his interpretation of this choral masterpiece. He lives up to his reputation as one of the great British baritones of all times. He is able to express the baritone solo with superb musicianship and nuance. This is a challenging piece for choruses. It demands a level of musicianship which should not be attempted by amateur choirs. The choir is also superb and follows the composers dynamics respectively. I highly recommend the CD if you are only interested in this work. It's worth it.Tim Kennedy
4,"haunting, mystical vocal works by an English master","A good selection of VW's more mystical works - the orchestral suite for viola and wordless chorus, FLOS CAMPI, is particularly unusual and worth hearing..."
1,A Collection of Hackeyed Cliches,Mr. Beowulf is badly in need of a writing instructor. This book desperately in need of editing. There is no consideration of basic plot points and structure. There is a convoluted and unnecessary digression into WWII. It meanders to an unbelievable ending.Mr. Beowulf also needs a dictionary. This way he can know the definitions of the words he uses (erstwhile is a good example). Come to think of it an English grammar class would also be helpful.All in all not worth the paper it's printed on.
5,A Must Have,"This met all my expectations and more....the detail in this figure is magnificent. This is one to be displayed with pride that your a big Star Wars fan. Can't wait to buy Boba Fett to add to my collection like it says these are ""a must have."""
3,Solving One Problem Then Creating Another,"This is the Tupperware Flat Out issue in reverse. Because the top has to expand to ""stuff"" an excessive amount of food into the container, it can not be used as a cover in the microwave. Still, it's one of those Tupperware items that comes in handy when you have huge quanities of leftovers to store in the fridge."
5,Excellent source of information,"This book is great!!!! I have been messing around with home recording for about 2 years, So I say I am still new at this. This book has got me off on the right foot, and helped to set up the studio I have now. It has also shown what kinda of upgrades I can make in the future. I now have everything that I want to get in the future laid out in the order I want/need to get them. I highly recommend this book"
3,WARNING!! overcharged!!,"I am very displeased about you charging me more than $20 for a book that at the same time is reduced to $16.That is not good practice, and I'm expecting this to be corrected.Thanks very much!!Tom R.Home Recording For Musician For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education"
3,Good for beginners,"This book is basically recording 101. I think it actually even advertises it as that. Well...It only covers basics and the basic techniques of compression, expansion, etc. It doesn't get much more into anything beyond that or advanced. True, if I hadn't taken Audio Arts I at my college, I would've bought it...But I did and I see I already know 90% of the info in it."
2,Seems old,I was wanting assistance with computer software like Audacity - this may help me - but not really what I hoped for.
1,dummies,i ordered this book thinking it would explain how to use a microphone unfortunately it is so far above my experience that it is useless to me i am dumber than a dummy
3,Beauty Is In The Eyes Of The Beholder.,"All of her little books have Oriental book jackets, all similar, and she uses the same format of short vignettes to tell varied and many stories. A COLLECTION OF BEAUTIES, goes back in time to the late-twenties and early-thirties to the fetish of beauty and youth. No age is perfect.These characters will realize sooner or later that beauty fades as they age, and there is nothing they can do about it. These related tales are reminiscent of her earlier books, and she seems to be searching for her Japanese roots in this one in particular.Sometimes, beauty is on the inside of a person, no matter what age; some older women are still beautiful until their eyes get sunk in. The changing hair is fascinating, and who cares whethre you dye it some outrageous color or not. Natural is better but, let me tell you, there is no ""aging gracefully."" These women have much to learn before they can truly be beauties."
3,Well written but didnt like the characters,"This book left me with a bad feeling. It is well written and I found myself reflecting on insights it offered about people in general. However, I didnt like the characters. San Francisco is the setting and its intertwined in the plot (not really a plot but rather a snap shot of many peoples lives). All the characters are smart, good looking and living in the moment without any regard for other people. They are happiest in each others company partying and druging. They want what they cant have and dont achieve anything. Is Otto saying this is how we all are or just this particular click of friends, I am not sure but I didnt find myself identifying or liking any of them. In spite of my lack of interest for the characters, I did finish it and I admire the author's writting style and talent."
2,Artsy artsy...,"Otto tries to make a parallel with the Japanese pillowbooks (a Japanese courtisan's version of a journal with random thoughts scrawled in bed) with this particular book.Though the metaphor works to an extent, it is difficult to follow as a novel, with a huge cast of characters and leaves the reader wanting something more -- specifically more of plot development instead of momentary snaphsots.All the snapshots involve love affairs or some particular hookup for that particular chapter. Now, I'm sure a lot more happened in the 80's than the latest drama of your friend by three degrees. So, the reader, unless he or she's looking for a romance book is left slightly nauseated.But, I have to say the book is very pretty. Nice typography, layout and even a nice colophon at the end. (for what it's worth, right?)"
2,Not great.,"I had some hopes for Whitney Otto's ""A Collection of Beauties at the Height of Their Popularity"". I found it less charming than ""How To Make an American Quilt,"" and I found ""Quilt"" to be faintly charming, at best.Set in the 1980s, in San Francisco, Otto could have made some real statements about chosen families. She does not.Her characters are all educated, struggling to affluent, and many of them are pretentious as anything. Casual references to architects, designer clothing and furniture- it is as much a catalogue as a novel. Most of the chracters are in their late 20s, early 30s, making them my contemporaries. Instead of doing something, many of them are merely content to see and be seen, on the fringes of San Francisco's art scene.Otto does not mention AIDS.A better take on similar material is the New York centered ""Story of My Life,"" by Jay McInerny..."
3,Was just okay for me.........,"I thought when I originally got this book that it was short stories written about the paintings- I was wrong. I had some trouble following the characters, and was more confused with their names, when she introduced them in the beginning, I had toreread the lines to see if they were male or female. I am not into books that drain the brain- if I want that, I will watchtelevision.Sorry-"
2,"BORING, BLEAK, and BOSTON.","There are a few reasons I don't like this book-I'm a Phillies fan, so boo Red sox.And 2, the ending was bad, which is a shame because the begining was so good.The book is about a group of kids who in the 2024 season of baseball suspect that the world series curse has descended on the Red sox again,so they gang up to dismantle ""the brain"", or the computerized umpire.Some things don't make sense-the monster in the sewer? That's awfully random, and if this Gerard guy thought he was scaring anybody-he was boring them. And apparantly the narrator's dad was a button salesmen? What the heck?I have to admit, the begining was well written, it kept me reading, but then it seems that the author got bored with the book, because by the end it totally falls apart. I mean, TOTALLY. It's like watching YOUR candy bar being eaten by somebody else-torture I tell you!Don't waste your money!"
3,Get higher capacity batteries (2500mAh+) from other manufacturers,"Save your mney and get higher capacity batteries from other manufacturers.There are lots of 2500mAh batteries available from major brands, and even a 2700mAh model from a smaller manufacturer."
2,Better AND cheaper alternatives at Amazon,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IYP9M/103-1134476-0130206?v=glance&n;=172282http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DUQCM/sr=1-2/qid=1135060940/ref=sr_1_2/103-1134476-0130206?%5Fencoding=UTF8[...]I just walked out of Lowes with a 30 miunute charger (they are done charging already - I need to type faster.) with 4 whimpy 1850mAh AA batteries in the charger for $30 and bought 4 2500mAh Energizer AA cells for $10 for use in my A610 Canon. I needed the whimpy ones for my cordless mouse anyway, but check the included batteries for 2200mAh or better if you can. [...] has the scoop on their rechargeables. Check the FAQs and oh, there is a 15 minute charger available too now. The 30 minute charger left the batteries almost too hot to touch, so maybe that is fast enough."
4,rechargeable batteries,Canon CBK4-200 Rechargeable Battery and Charger Kit for PowerShot CamerasAlways have a spare set of recharged batteries since camera only takes 2 at a time. The camera will take non-rechargeable AA batteries also. It's a win-win.
1,CANON Battery Charger,"I haven't received the charger that I originally payed for as of August 18th, 2006. I keep getting updated messages to review the shipping date.I just want the charger since I purchased 2 canon cameras. Please getback to me an update on the charger. I still want it.Robert. W. Love"
1,I cancelled this order!,"I ended up not purchasing this rechargeable battery and charger kit from Amazon because I had waited for it for about 5 weeks and gave up. Then I discovered that I could buy a similar product at Staples, and cheaper too! I don't think Amazon is the place to go for electronic products."
2,Battery life not as good as I had expected,"After only a few weeks, the batteries' ability to hold the charge decreased significantly. My Canon Powershot A540 would show full battery at first and then be completely drained after 3 hours of light use. Not good for trips, you're better off buying lithium batteries or regular batteries for cheap. I would not buy this product again."
5,These are smokin'........,I use the Canon PowerShot S1 IS 10x Zoom with the 3.2 pixels.I am totally addicted to this type of photography.We heard the Canon recharger and battery set was expensive..But I wanted to stick with the same company for all my supplies.These batteries and the extra set I bought are in constant use.We have a set at our vacation home and here at the house.I didn't want to be without because I spend a great part of my day with the camera.I need to have fast and fully loaded batteries...I am happy with this set.
1,ZEREO STARS,"Why ?Because i never recieved the item i ordered.I recieved a "" Globe Trotter"" charger. It charges okay but runs hot."
3,Battery life very short after only 2 recharges,"The first and second times I charged the batteries up, they were great. Lasted a very long time with my Canon A560 camera. However, after the 3rd recharge, the batteries don't even last 5 minutes before I get the low battery warning. I've charged the batteries about 3 more times since, and the same problem persists. I don't recharge until the camera displays the low battery alert and I've stored the spare batteries (the camera only uses two, so there are always 2 idle) in a dark and dry place as the instructions say, but the battery life is still bad. Perhaps I inadvertently did something to shorten their lives. I will try to let the batteries go completely dead before I try to recharge one last time before giving up."
2,too gapey,I loved the look of these shoes until I put them on. They gaped terribly at the sides. I know everyone's feet are different but the way these shoes gaped made them look very cheap. I returned them.
1,Tough To Take,"This is strange, pretty crude material that's sincerely tough listening to. This buff returned it for better things of Bob's: Kaya, Uprising."
5,More Excellence of Bob Marley 1970-71,"Out of the 8 cd's of the Complete Wailers 1967-1972 collection, this may be the best set. The Soul Rebels album and the Soul Revolution Part II album showcase 2 of the Wailers best albums ever. And the excellent More Axe cd is a collection of singles and alternate tracks released in 1970-71 including an unreleased take of ""Kaya"", and the raraties of ""Run for Cover"", ""Man to Man"", and the great ""All in One"", and Curtis Mayfield's ""Long Long Winter"". All tracks produced by Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, and all tracks are excellent. Their are also some crucial dubs on this set. ""It's Alright"", Rebels Hop"", ""Reaction"", ""Put it On"", ""Sun is Shining"", ""Long Long Winter"", and ""Nicoteen"" are awesome dubs. You dont find much better reggae let alone music than this. This is the best quality you'll find out there of this music, and only Marvin Gaye could relate to the message the Wailers were sending through their music at this time."
1,Horrible!,The music on this CD is horrible. It sounds like it was recorded by some guy using a synthesizer and a personal PC! It doesn't do the original score by Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola justice at all. Don't waste your money.
1,like a K-Tel production,"A quick example --Pull up and listen/watch ""Senza Mama"" from Godfather II on youtube or your dvd. It's the flashback scene at the live theatre where the 20 year-old Vito bumps into the the 'Black Hand' guy for the first time.Now click the 'listen' button here on the Amazon page.Obviously it's a different singer, the music is pc generated and poorly done at that.Save your money and buyThe Godfather Part II (1974 Film)instead."
2,For the aficionados only,"This is a collection of three Wire performances, two at the Roxy in London and one at the CBGB Theatre in New Work. Ultimately I found this release very disappointing, especially considering its high price and the terrible sound quality of the CBGB performance.On the first disc are two sets recorded at The Roxy in London, recorded some time before the release of their debut album, Pink Flag. They feature identical setlists and were performed to an almost empty room, so there is little audience interaction. The liner notes reveal that these recordings do have some historical value, however, as they were instrumental in getting the band signed to EMI.On the second disc there is a short set they performed at the legendary CBGB Theatre in New York, featuring material from their first two albums. This performance was recorded by a radio station, but very badly! The sound quality is just awful, making me seriously regret my purchase."
3,Glorified statuettes,"Even back in the mid-1990s, these figures were somewhat disappointing. They're very stiff with no articulation. Fortunately, Hasbro released 2 new Ugnaught figures with great articulation and detail. You can check one of them outhere."
5,1280 pages pure and applied calculus + answers and appendix,"This book is so comprehensive you can use it for any engineering and general purposes. You must also get it`s study guides and instructor`s book for an efficient study... Their study guide 1 ISBN: 0-534-936-261, 2 ISBN: 0-534-936-27X, Instructor`s manual 1 ISBN: 0-534-936-30X and 2 ISBN: 0-534-936-318."
5,Very good for calculus beginners.,"I have used this book as textbook for my class. This book is easy to follow and leads students to think. I highly recommend students to work all its problems. The only drawback has nothing to do with the book rather with its price. prof. Swokowski has already passed away in 1992, but the price has absolutely no reason to stay this high."
4,Great Reflexology chair!,"I use this chair in my reflexology practice. It is comfortable for the client and allows me to raise their feet up to workable level without hunching over. The only down side is the metal bar on the bottom. It seems to hit my tall clients right on the back of their heel (ever been hit there by a shopping cart? ouch!) I fixed that problem by slicing a line down the side of a foam pool noodle and wrapping it around the bar. Great chair! Many of my clients want to order one up for themselves! :)I sometimes have to place a pillow under the clients feet for better leverage, but over all this is a great chair. I actually came to Amazon this morning to order a second one, so I figured I would leave a review. ;)"
2,Padded arm chair,Works ok if you are a very skinny person. I am a little older and not as small as I was as a teenager. It's pretty comfortable. I wouldn't recommend it for purchase or to anyone. Sam's sells the same style for around 60 dollars and it's much wider and more comfortable
2,bad design,After just three weeks the fastener at the end of the string broke off and I had to repair it.Also the string is already wearing out and will probably need replaced very soon.Bad design.
4,An epic fantasy.,"A young warrior-priest travels to a faraway land to be beaten, imprisoned, and finally nursed back to health by an embittered prison guard and a young girl. This terrible betrayal had been set in motion by a ruler who harbors an intense hatred in his heart, a hatred so overwhelming that he will sacrifice his eldest son to the destruction of the hated place. Events set in motion by Cyran's ruler come to a head when Dru, the young hostage, is compelled to complete the task he has been sent to accomplish. But if Dru succeeds, an entire world of people will be destroyed, by the residents of the Necropolis. Xina Marie Uhl calls upon her obviously extensive knowledge of ancient history in the fantasy adventure Necropolis. At what seems to be the climax, Ms. Uhl toys with the reader's emotions in a brilliant double twist which ensures that the book cannot be abandoned until the last page is read."
5,The dead come to life in this thrill ride,"Xina Marie Uhl's Necropolis goes beyond the usual sword-and-sorcery warmed-over Tolkien fantasy rehashes, delivering characters as nuanced and plots as intricate as Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The sense of dread and terror in this quasi-Roman Empire (maybe Judea with hints of a Christ figure) city of Eretria, conducting negotiations with their enemy Cyra while plots and counterplots reign, is as persistent as chemical weapons in Iraq, and the political situation is twice as explosive. And amnesiac priest Dru may hold the key...and as in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, an unlikely group of allies faces the ultimate evil, unimaginable peril and destiny in the terrifying Necropolis."
4,Looks great in the package,"Haven't gotten to install it yet, but everything looks good so far. Appears well built and got here on time."
1,dont buy,"sounds awful, the tubing they provide slides off when the horn is blown so i had to buy new stuff, it sounds so bad I'm embarrassed to ever use it."
5,Fiamm Horn sounds just like the General,"The Fiamm Dixieland Horn sounds perfect. Squirt a bit of oil in the compressor from time to time and the speed is just right. I had a Wolo brand Dixie horn before, and the Wolo trumpets were just a bit off-key. It was very frustrating, and I was never quite satisfied, even though a lot of other Dukes fans claim the Wolo horn is the original. Perhaps it is, and between the two brands, Wolo and Fiamm, the compressors seem very much the same, as does the hardware and hoses, etc., . But, these Fiamm trumpets are much better. The difference is in the length of the trumpets, and the Fiamm trumpets make the the perfect tone. They sound like they are supposed to. Finally, I have a Dixie horn that truly sounds like the General Lee. FYI, the trumpets arrived in red, not the purple color pictured online, which was fine with me, since I painted them black anyway. Thanks, Fiamm. You have a good ear for music!"
5,gets attention,easy to install sounds like it should color coded rings make hookup super easy just needed compressor but redid the whole 9 yards
3,Not complete kit.,"When I ordered this i expected a complete kit with every thing needed to install. But i had to buy the horn switch, 16 gauage wire, 20 amp inline fuse holder, wire connecors, and a bracket to hold the trumpets.Since I ordered all of the parts needed im still waiting for them to come so i can review about the sound quality."
4,Great Christmas Gift!,I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my three year old goddaughter. She absolutely loves it!! I was advised that she's very into the Disney Priness line and now I'm sure she's a true Disney Princess musician. I'm a frequent Amazon shopper and will continue to do so...
3,"Good enough, but not the best","My five year old only wanted a violin for Christmas. I couldn't find any children's violin's anywhere so when I found this one I ordered it immediately. Her response to opening it on Christmas morning was ""This isn't a real violin!"" And it's not. It's just a toy shaped like a violin that play music when you press a button. Great for smaller children I suppose, but it was not a hit with my daughter in the least."
3,Another compilation....,".... that only real fans would want.This is another compilation that was licensed from EMI. Unlike the others, a small chunk of the tracks were the lesser known tracks. All have been previously released.OUtside of the fact that there is nothing new, tracks from Misplaced Child were split when they sound better when they are together (example: Childhoods End and White Feather).If you are a casual fan and you have just The Essentials or one of the other compilations, then it isn't bad. For anyone else, ignore this one."
5,Definitely one of the hidden gems in the Hyperion series,"With few exceptions I have been rating the romantic piano and violin concertos (66) in the 4 star range. Yes they are pleasant, beautiful and all worth listening to. But most are simply not memorable being tier 2 concertos. But the concertos by these Norwegian composers have the romance, power, virtuosity, and thematic beauty which have caused us to revere but only a dozen or so piano concertos; witness what is usually played at classical concerts. These two stand out from the Hyperion pack as forgotten and hidden gems that you will listen to many times."
2,"Movie blows, buy individual disks","Please, please, please, do not buy this boxed set. The movie will make you wonder where you money has gone to, perhaps Albuquerque? Anyways, it's a truly pointless movie, and your wasting your money if you buy the set, so please buy vol. 1 and vol. 2 instead. Animation is great, music is cool, if I see one more staircase scene with freaky chants in the background I'm gonna be sick, but otherwise, good show."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"Maybe I didn't properly read what the book was about, maybe i did. But this book was quite useless. I purchased it as an aide to better understand the concepts in my precalculus text. However, I learned it was nothing more, whatsoever, than what its title states: an outline. The book is better suited for people who already have a strong grasp of the material but would like a quick reference, more than for those who need extra help in understanding concepts. If you need clarity from your current school text and more guidance, I suggest you find another book. If you need a quick, very brief reference that explains very little, than buy this book. I erased it from my Kindle library and found better instruction on youtube."
3,Not a tutorial.,"This book is based on examples that are written in the form a+b+c=d or b+c+d=a, etc. I gave the book a 3 not because of how it is written. I feel sure that if you are having no problems with math this outline will work fine for you. However, it is just as it reads, AN OUTLINE. The 3 rating is because it came up when I was searching for books for beginning (as in I am stupid and don't know how to do it) calculus and that is NOT what this book is for. This book does not (and I am sure that it isn't supposed to) teach the theories of mathmatics from the ground up. So, if your struggling in a math class or you are wanting to get a jump on a math class, don't get this book. As previously mentioned, I am sure that it is a good book and does what it is intended to do. Teach you calculus is NOT what it is intended to do."
5,awesome,"The turn signal lamps were on time and brand new as promised, AWESOME!There is nothing more to say about this trsnsaction."
5,Great Story!,I first watched this movie on Netflix and found it so good that I had to own it. Its funny yet dark at times and has a twist in the end that you'll never see coming!
1,Depressing for No Reason,"I will admit that I couldn't stomache this movie and turned it off before watching to the end, but I found no redeeming message or entertainment value at all in the first half. Murder in cold blood is never justifiable no matter how good it may feel and to suggest otherwise undermines law and order. If the second half redeems itself I'm sure I'll be properly corrected."
4,excelentes ilustraciones,"las ilustraciones de Rodney son estupendas, le contenido es un poco superficial, pero el arte de matthews es inigualable"
5,Outrageously entertaining,"Written in the florid style of its time, this book is fun to read if you don't take it too seriously. A good introduction to the Great Merlini, who is featured in three other mysteries novels, the best of which is No Coffin for the Corpse."
1,DO NOT TRUST,"My accessory pack did not come with a screen cloth, a screen protector,no remote for earphones and added to the earphones the wires were frayed there was also no 32mb memory card"
2,Quite Good Songs But Most Not Originals,"These are quite good songs from 1962, mostly rock and pop, with a little R & B. However, when I got the CD in the mail, I was disappointed to read on the back cover that all the songs except for ""Party Lights"" by Claudine Clark are NOT originals, but rather are later re-recordings with the lead singer and one or more of the original backup group. Who knows how many years later these were recorded? The sound quality and performances here are decent, but of the ones I've heard the originals of, most of these re-recordings are significantly inferior to the originals. So, this is a pretty enjoyable CD to listen to, but be aware that all but one are NOT the original recordings by these performers. If you're like me in preferring the original recordings from 1962, tryTime Life The Rock 'N' Roll Era 1962and also1962 Superhits Time Life."
4,Greg Kihn Underated,"I always thought his music was underrated since I first started selling his music in a Record Store only a few blocks from where he lived. As years went by I never really collected his bands music but still heard some on radio. Now that I'm a"" Born Again Hippie"" I've be getting into Greg's music again.So check this CD out, it really nice. I think it ROCKS !In Concert (22/Apr/1986 Philadelphia)"
1,Shop around,"Get real. I can find wooden sets for 1.49, and I bought a folding wooden set (men and board)for $6.00. I have seen stone sets for under $15.00"
4,An Encyclopedia of the Weird,"The Bords have produced an encyclopedia, desk reference type of book which chronicles as many sightings and encounters as possible.The book is divided up into varied creatures, lake monsters, etc., and is a vast storehouse of reports, though whether or not many of these can be verified I don't know.Nearly every nation in the world has had strange events, and some of these are familiar, while others border on the comical.A good reference for the fan of the mysterious, the paranormal or the wannabe cryptozoologist."
2,You get what you pay for...,The chain is pretty cheap and only a simple round ring holds the heart on the chain. The heart is smaller than I thought it would be (my fault for not really paying attention to the details).I may put it on a nicer chain or even on a charm bracelet given it's size. The Mother-of-Pearl material is very pretty so I won't be wasting this purchase.
5,New artist - Beautiful - easy listening and memorable,"I came across these new 18 yr old artist on the Mother Jones website of all places. The site (Mother Jone In Tune) lets you sample many new artists. I listened to a few with Setara being one of them. I didn't care enough for the others but when I got to Louise Setara it was different. I think she is really good and not in an american idol way, either. She has a breathy kind of singing that a promo site of her's describes as ""soulful"" and ""gospel tinged."" Maybe, that and a heavy dose of heart (and every once in awhile a bit of good country). Really nice lyrics that's for sure. I don't know if she writes her own work. Anyhow, she's got a MySpace with samples on it (like everyone else). Check it out. I highly recommend this lady."
1,Paying to Read an Advertisement,"This series is 90% self-serving advertisements of the authors products and 10% information you can find for free elsewhere. Don't buy the products he mentions, or go to his website of more advertisements of his products, or go to the other websites that he mentions and is also obviously affliated with. The only person that profits from his system is him. Save time and Google for info instead."
3,You're all confused...,"This set has NOTHING to do with Kurt Cobain. The person praising it has obviously never heard it, and the other was disappointed because he did not read the description. This is the British cult/rock group NIRVANA. They sound nothing even remotely similar to eachother. The bands having the same name is a huge problem for any collector, though. I offer this advice: Find it at the store before ordering (you'll probably find that AMAZON's price is well below the store). That way you can SEE if it's the correct group."
4,"Great selection of tracks, info lacking","The 60s (UK) Nirvana is absolute magic for certain moods; their songs possessed quite the same haunting quality as the Moodies' ""Ride My See-Saw"" and The Guess Who's ""These Eyes"", but also their own, indescribable tranquilizing ""X-Factor"", which is guaranteed to put you in a state of dream, NOT sleep. The selection on offer here is good and complete, yet info is sorely lacking in the enclosed booklet; we don't even know which tracks are rarities and previously unreleased's. Another minor gripe is Edsel's choice to mix in the 80s ""reunion"" tracks, driven by a drum machine together with the vintage tracks from the 60s and 70s. Other than that, heartily recommended."
3,"Nirvana, but not the 90's grunge rock group with Kurt","First off, yes that is right. There is a second rock group named Nirvana. They have nothing at all to do with the 80's / 90's alternative/grunge rock group with Kurt Cobain. The cd's still pretty good though. It's mainly typical 60's British psychadella-rock, which of course sounds nothing at all like the Seattle group that most of us now as Nirvana.I wouldn't even be sure if Kurt's group was aware that there even was another group called Nirvana, but I know that they were, becuase here's an interesting little bit fo trivia for you.The song Lithium on here is the same song that the other Nirvana does. Which mean, yes, the 90's Lithium was originally written by the 60's group. it's sort of funny to listen to the orignal one becuase it's almost more of a lounge song then a punk song. Anyways, hope this helped to clear up any confusuion about this."
5,Curt,if any one doesn't buy this set because the music was not popular should not even bother buying any Nirvana cd. being poular does not make music good. who ever listens to this other person and doesn't buy the set cause the music isn't popular should never buy another real rock album again. in my view you might as well go out and buy some N sync albums.
1,Lithium was NOT written by this group,"It is true that this group was the orginal Nirvana, but when the 90's Nirvana came out they were more famous then this group would/could ever be and they got into a legal situation with the name and it was seattled, just because the song ""Lithium"" by the 90's group Nirvana is on this Box Set does not mean that the 60's Nirvana wrote it. The 60's Nirvana covered Lithium. IT IS A KURT COBAIN SONG NOT A SONG BY THIS 60'S NIRVANA!"
3,Dumbas*,"the dude from that one that said Nirvana with Krist, Kurt, and Dave were the ones who made lithium first. and kurt did know that there was already a band called Nirvana, there is no way a psycadella - british band could thing of a lounge song with the title of lithium, i mean lithium is a poison. You must be some old freak."
1,too bad,"I did not like this CD. I really felt that this CD was going to be really good, but I was very disappointed when I received this CD in the mail. I feel that the CD had many tracks that were unknown to me and I didn't like them because they were not popular. I would recommend that if you are interested in buying this CD you check it out first and take a listen. You may then decide after hearing it. However, for me this CD was a big disappointment."
1,Buyer beware!! -- Dishonest business,"I purchased a TV antenna through them(DiscountsJungle) and they sent me a defective product which they did not credit me back shipping for! Read my review of this dealing at http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IZX0UA8ZN9S/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permThey can do the same for you, and customer satisfaction is NOT their #1 priority, it's more like stealing money is their #1 priority, allowed by a dishonest manager."
4,grandma,My Granddaughter loves her doll however I was very disappointed that I spent so much for the doll and the pants will not stay up !!!!! I had to put new elastic in the pants
4,Good book for kids,"I agree with the first reviewer. This book is a tremendously good book that kids will enjoy. It's wonderfully written, teaches kids a few things, like Thomas Edison and his inventions. This is sort of a funny book, also. Once again, I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes to read Arthur books."
5,"Great for everyone, young and old","I bought this book for my teenage twins and found myself drawing up a storm. Learn the very basics of drawing, starting with circles and boxes, shading and perspective. We spent many very enjoyable hours and it gives children a sense of accomplishment. This is my number one gift this Christmas for children of all ages."
4,Brief review,"Satisfactory for gift for our (artistic) 11-year-old granddaughter; we expect it to help her in freehand drawing, especially of 3-D drawings on a 2-D surface. She can take it from there as her abilities and interest (and parental support) permit.Thanks."
5,"""Great Playing""","This is an album that gives an example of how you can use minimal instruments in a group and sound full and satisfying.Grappelli is showing his age just slightly,but still has that fantastic tone and tasteful improvs.Bucky plays like Bucky and doesn't try to imitate anyone else who may have filled the guitar chair before him.Jon Burr was a favorite bassist of Steph's and it's easy to hear why as he anticipates the key modulations and tempo changes and carries the rhythym for both Bucky and Steph when they are playing solos.This album was one of the last of Steph's and I highly recommend it."
3,Helpful but Not the Best,"Used the series for a class I was taking. Even with instructor assistance, the book wasn't very conducive to learning. Genki is much more thorough, and Pimsler is great for oral training."
2,It's not that great,"If you are looking for a book that helps you with Japanese grammar then this book is not for you. The book does not give in depth lessons and there are no english translations for sentences making it even more difficult to learn the language. The color pages is the only thing that is good about the book. I do not recommend this book for beginners, look elsewhere."
4,Good Deal,"The dart board and cabinet set is very well built and I think worth the money. It was shipped on time and came wrapped properly. There was only a small discoloration in the wood on the bottom of the cabinet door that caught my eye, but I think overall it was a good deal."
1,what gives Amazon?,"I ordered this dart board from Amazon. However, the next day, Amazon sent an email saying that my order had been cancelled - no explination, just cancelled.Amazon -- if its out of stock, no longer being produced, etc...then the ad should be taken down.The price was too good to be true...oh well."
3,"Great board, Good Cabinet, OK Darts",If you are looking for a cost effective dart option for your game room the Halex board is a nice one. The board itself is probaly only below the Winmau Blade III of the ones I've played on. The cabinet that comes with this set looks fine and seems to hold up well. The dry erase scoreboards are a nice touch. If you have better darts use them (We do) with this set. The darts that come with the set are just basic cheap darts and you're probably not going to be impressed by those. Over-all though for the money we like the set and it looks good in the game room.
2,Exchanged twice.Arrived broken twice.,The dart board was a Christmas gift I purchased for someone and when he opened it the case was cracked. We returned it for another one and that one also arrived with a cracked case. The company does not pack it properly. I have returned the second one and have asked for credit to my account.
1,Very poor,"Halex does not make thier boards up to the standards as other boards. For the price they charge they should actually make them better. I bought a boards, and after a few months the landing pads are broken. Halex just said o well. I babyed this dartboard, and to have this happen no it not right. The dartboards I use out at resturants hold up I throw hard onto thier plastic boards, but Halex onyl wants a quick buck. BUYER BEWARE PRODUCT IS NOT MADE WELL NOTHING BY HALEX IS GOOD AS EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT."
1,Annoyed,"This product shipped without the necessary parts to put up the board. I ordered it about a month ago and still have no received the parts. I also was lead to believe that darts would be with the order, but they were not as well."
2,Very Unsatisfied,"This didn't even come with English instructions so I had to try my best and look up on the Internet how to hang it up and ALL the darts broke within 48 hours! Had to buy more darts to even play! It's a good ""dartboard"", though. Everything else was crap."
4,It is what it is...,"It's huge... There's like a pipe or something where the spine/neck is... not plush all the way through. I don't think you can really hurt anyone with it, but I wouldn't be throwing it around at your kids either.Right now, it sits upon a shelf for display, nice enough there so the kids can't get at it. The bow tie is adjustable, like it has hard wires in it so you can fold and set. (they don't poke through, if you're worried about that.And and it's pretty cool that the doll can sit on it's own without support... after a few tries anyways."
4,"A nice, nostelgic read","The title of this book had always gotten my attention as a kid (I'm now 28), but I never read it. On a whim, me and my girlfriend read it together--we really enjoyed it. It is imaginative, yet grounded in problems real kids face (divorce, fitting in, etc.) A very enjoyable read."
5,A MUST READ!!,"This book is one of those books that you can't stop reading. One heck of a horror tale! A book for all ages and an interesting story to tell your friends about, even if they hate scary stories and suspense."
4,STUPID NOT,THIS BOOK WAS AWFUL IT WAS HORRIBLE BOOK AND WHOEVER WROTE IT SHOULD NOT SELL IT EVER JUST KIDDING IT WAS AN OK BOOK.
3,NOT for the faint hearted,"This is an 'acquired taste.' You'll need to have some prior experience with depression era lamentation style and actually enjoy that before you consider taking this trip. Uneven compilation of rare tracks from the 1930's with all the attendant technolgical glitches that implies. If you enjoy this sort of thing... then this is the sort of thing you'll enjoy!Yeah I know... well how about this then: Do you prefer ""authentic"" ? This is the authentic stuff. This is Sour Mash cooked up in a copper kettle with a copper coil over a wood fire on a wooded mountainside... don't use no green wood - it makes too much smoke an' the G-men will see your hidey place. Still... Pass that jug."
3,work at first..,it worked at first then broke after three weeks.. how? i don't know but .. truly it didn't speed up the sata drive.. long run >> ended up getting a sata adapter for the PC.. don't waste money on this at all..
1,That sound you hear is this movie sucking,"sucks, awful, atrocious, repellent and did I mention this film sucks, enough said. When you look up sucks in the dictionary you have a picture of this film."
1,Another waste!,Looks like someone needs to bury this film in the woods where it came from a sort of slasher film but like soft core slasher.
1,Absolutely Idiotic!,"I love horror movies, and I should have passed right by this one. No Wonder they didn't provide a Usurp detailing this piece of garbage!! There was no plot, the acting was extremely bad, and a complete waste of money!I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even the parents of the makers! Jeez, what a complete home video junk!"
1,awful,I didnt even last 5 min in this movie. Worse movie in america.. I tried to fast forward it totally sux
1,Not as good as I expected it to be.,"Release date 2010 and was made in the 70s. Unless it is a movie I liked and remembered seeing, I should not rent these. Most of them are not as good as the more recent movies. The movies made between the 90s and those of today are much better."
3,not bad but overpriced for crossover event,If you liked the Inferno HC and Mutant Massacre HC I think they are pretty representative of what you are getting here. Still I wish it would be $20 cheaper without the crossover filling like the Inferno HC (the extra issues are ok but just cause disconnect with different writers & art.I thought pretty good but I must admit I'm a bit disappointed for over $60. Pay an extra $10 and get the Thor Omnibus which in my mind is the best thing put out in the 80's -amazing.
4,it was pretty good,"this book wasn't the best ever, but it was really good, & the average rating needs to be brought up. this has 3 separate storylines: xmen, new mutants, & x-factor. the x-men story is them fighting the adversary, & the world thinking they died. this set the stage for their australia years, which was a major part of x-history. the x-factor one had apocalypse attacking manhatten, x-factor learning what he did to angel, & them gaining SHIP. the new mutants one had a pretty stupid villain, but it also had the death of doug ramsey (cypher) which was very memorable & sad"
3,Not for me,"Being a fan of the x-men and comics in general (but not a fanatic) I realize the importance of these issues but at the same time walk away somewhat puzzled and dissapointed. As a younger fan of the X-Men I don't understand where these stories lead in terms of the current situations in the series. Especially the New X-Men. Who were they, where did they go? Magneto ran a or the school? Also compared to todays artwork this stuff is chickenscratch. Also the preachiness that runs in the first part is a little over the top and serves against the purpose rather than for it. Good for a history lesson if nothing else but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this."
5,Just the right size for a room size presentation,"The brightness of the screen enhances the view of the images being displayed. We've watched Power Point presentations, DVD's, etc. The screen is very easy to set up."
4,Good Screen,"Good projector screen. Easy to set up. 50""x50"" size was good for home movies. Received it in a couple of days using UPS shipping."
5,Great Screen!,"My husband and I do a great deal of public speaking through our involvement with Business Network International and the Referral Institute. We purchased this screen because we wanted something versatile, lightweight and easy to set up to take to our venues. It did not disappoint! This screen has met all of our expectations for portability and ease of use. We highly recommend it to speaking professionals who travel with their Power Point presentations!"
5,Great screen for my slide shows!!!,"Lightweight, portable, amd built to last, this brand named product has a long reputation of quality and durability. Buy the bag that is ordered separately for approximately $30, and it will keep the product stored well!"
3,Was this Trip Really Necessary?,"The Crumb Handbook seeks to compile a fractured biography of Robert Crumb. The handbook has no major revelations about Crumb's life, and offers little else to anyone who is already familiar with his previously published work in the R. Crumb Coffee Table Book, Crumb the Motion Picture, and just about any autobiographical comic Crumb has drawn. Included with this book is a unique CD of Crumb playing music with various musicians as well as his family. Also included are nice color reprints of his drawings that would have been better suited to a larger format. The R. Crumb Handbook is ultimately a book of high quality but offers little else to the reader already familiar with his work."
3,talk talk,"Yet another set for the legendary group of Talk Talk, this is a compilation consisting of tracks produced between 1982 and 1986, some of their more 'known, but incomplete for their production.A must have if you are nostalgic for their fans like myself.Because they are my life musically."
2,disappointed,"This t-shirt did not match the picture of the shirt in the ads. The logo on the front of the t in the ads was red white and blue, the logo on the shirt i received was silverish not what I wanted, not what was represented."
4,Good Times,"I really like the song 'Its Alright"" came out in 1964 so thats it!! A,ll the other tunes are OK but Only that one ,hits the spot for me"
5,corelle livingware,"I like the bowls -- they are large enough for a good sized salad or soup for a main course meal.In general, I like Corelle products. Light enough for everyday, hard to break, pretty and a good price."
1,Awesome characters get bastardized,"This game sucks. I bought it and I only put about two hours into over a two day period and I haven't played it since. If you're a huge Marvel fan (like me), it's fun to be able to play as your fav characters, but please, for the love of god, wait for it to be $20 until you buy it. It's NOT worth $40."
4,marvel nemisis,"Its a pretty fun game, the graphics are good, the characters are simple, and the fighting arena is almost all destructible; in multiplayer mode. The only flaws are the fact that in single player mode the levels are really easy to beat, and that the characters have almost all the same moves, so there's no surprises. But overall it's a pretty fun game."
2,SIMPLY BAD 4 OUT OF 10,"When I was playing SNK VS. Capcom with a group of people we decided to play this game. We were appalled by it's bad gameplay. Unlike great fighters like Street Fighter, Soulcalibur, Dead or Alive, and Tekken, this game does a poor job of being a fighter. To start off the camera angle that this game uses is a terrible angle for fighters which made it confusing to jump on things to get to an opponent. There is also a lack of combat moves, so the game gets boring quickly. It has lacking graphics(I've seen better on the Gamecube than this), the control scheme is confusing, and the voice actors suck. If you want to play a fighter staring the Marvel heroes, go play X-Men VS. Street Fighter instead."
2,Poor Quality,First they are not clear but have a purple tint. Second they tend to have a static charge which attracts dust .What were they thinking when they made these/
4,Excellent presentation of a unique culture's beliefs.,"Mrs. Stouff moved to live with the Chitimachas in the mid 1920's after marrying a future chief. She quickly fell in love with this unique and dying culture. As cultural assimilation was preached and ""Indianness"" was taught to be backwards and wrong, Ma' Faye, as she was known, kept records of all the stories, religious beliefs and and oral histories she heard so many times. The stories in this book run from creation lore to the origin of the Chitimacha clan system and everything in between. It can be said that this invaluable small book will one day be considered a vital link to the Chitimacha's past. As native groups struggle to hold on to what culture they have left, the Chitimachas should be thankful that Ma' Faye loved them so much."
4,Good roll,"This is a good quality tool roll. I almost had trouble finding enough tools to fill it.My only complaint is the socket pockets are not big enough for the sizes I wanted to store in them. Max size is ~12mm long, and ~14mm short, if you can get the flaps closed."
3,Good for the price,"I bought this to carry a set of necessary tools on my motorcycle for long trips. It does the job, the materials are a little stiff and the pocket/elastic design does an OK job of holding everything in. The socket pockets on the end are particularly useful. Overall, though, feels fairly cheap, material is stiff, and occasionally tools slip out in normal handling. Overall serves the purpose I got it for and was inexpensive enough that I feel good about the cheapness."
4,Nice tool roll!,"I bought this tool roll for my motorcycle. It seems to be of decent quality. I think it will hold up great. The pockets are nice and can hold a variety of different tools. It held everything I wanted to have with me. The elastic to hold the tools in place isn't the best, It is kind of slack so it doesn't hold the tools very tight. I don't think that will be an issue once its rolled up and strapped down. I did have to switch the clips around that strap it together, they were put on backwards. My only real issue with the bag is the socket holding section. The pockets are an odd size. They are too deep for shallow sockets but the flat that covers them up isn't long enough for deep sockets. Maybe 1/4"" drive deep sockets would fit well but the pockets are still giant for sockets that small. As it sits now its fully loaded without any sockets in the ""socket pockets"" and its about the size of a 2-liter bottle. A bit large but works well."
4,Watch out for the buckles,"I bought it to store my chisels and other woodworking tools (not really for transporting them around). Works well for this purpose. However, the roll came with the buckles on the straps reversed. You might have to flip the buckles around when you get it, otherwise strap adjustments will not 'lock'."
4,Pep boys wheel cover.,"This wheel cover is actually the same product you see at Pep Boys, but at a much better price. The outside carton actually had Pep Boys marked on it. The quality is not at the level of an OEM product, but these are much more solid than what you find at WalMart."
4,work well but,this helmet would not win beauty contest quit wide dimension i guess better protection but in functionality it is easy to adjust head fit and strap size are easy to adjust .
3,"A mixed bag of some great ideas, erratic artistry and poor social commentary","This is the same Batman we know and love from DKR, the trouble is we don't see enough of him. This is a Justice League ensemble piece, with the focus actually more on growth of Superman than the Dark Knight's quest to free the country of a tyrannical Lex Luthor. As a result, the Flash and Superman's daughter are given hardly any page time, making way for dreary, inconsequential talking heads that represent the general public/government - a poor replacement for the entertaining news reporter from DKR. The artistry is all over the place, ranging from the excellent to the downright rubbish. It doesn't matter how wacky you make a comic. If you can't actually tell what's going on, then it shouldn't be on the page. However, the overall arc of the story, to overthrow Luthor and defeat the Joker-copy (another character that doesn't have enough page time, especially considering the book's finale) is actually quite entertaining."
1,Shows what happens to a lot of artists,"Many artists have a great creative period that never returns. They get old. They lose their hormones. They create **** instead of art.Why dont they just stop? Well, old people like money a lot, makes them feel safe. It is a pity they dont even bother protecting the memory of previous great work."
1,This is bad beyond belief,"I loved year one, I thought Dark Knight Returns was a work of art, I felt Millers work really understood the conflicted soul of the Batman and gave him real depth. I have enjoyed most of Millers work and even when I didn't I could see the quality in it. This book is however a piece of rubbish, I ended up rushing through it desperate to get to the end. It feels like he had no idea what the story was about so just drew in every character he could think of. The artwork is terrible, the story is non existant, the characterisation is childish. Honestly please don't buy this, go back and read Dark Knight Returns again. Words cannot express how bad this book is, it is actually so bad it's almost worth buying just to see how bad it is."
3,I give it a 3,"I agree with a number of the negative reviews regarding the quality of the art and single layer of story. I did enjoy the insider's bias in the book and really enjoyed reading it simply because we do see a new level of Batman portrayed. If you ever wondered how far he could actually go with the powers that be and weren't quite satisfied with the faked death scenario of the original, you'll go for this."
1,Frank's earned his own suite at Arkham,"The only evil genius to be found in this entire DK2 debacle is the man behind the drawing board himself. Shouldn't Miller be rocketing towards outer-space right now as he leaves the ruin of his diabolical and dastardly efforts in his wake? Hubris such as the passing off of DK2 as product, much less worthy successor, is better left to the maniacal machinations of Darkseid, or maybe Enron. We've been duped into buying a slap-dash fever dream on high quality paper. I don't even want this pap to sit next to or touch up against other comics in my collection. Don't fall victim to the hype, as I did. That way lies madness. Spend your money on something that makes more sense, like baby diapers, or a subscription to the racing forum, or crack. Now, if this doesn't make you want to read DK2, I don't know what will."
3,Wacky Wayne Chronicles,"If you are expecting anything nearly as good as the Dark Knight Returns, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. While I was slightly disappointed with the book overall, I've gotta say that this is one of the craziest comics (graphic novel, whatever) that I've ever read in my entire life. It's worth reading at least and while it doesn't ruin the memory of the original Dark Knight Returns, it's just too out there for me. The art is really funky and kind of sloppy, the writing isn't Miller at his peak and the story is a weird mishmash of cameos and political satire.And the fate of one character in particular (I don't want to ruin the surprise because the individual shows up literally out of nowhere as one of the piece's main villains and shows up almost nothing like you remember them) was just mind boggling.Worth a read but I don't know about recommending a purchase on this."
1,Terrible!,"Miller had written two of the greatest Batman stories ever with the Dark Knight Returns and Batman Year One, and with The Dark Knight Strikes Again he has written one of the worst. Bad art, bad writing, a very poor effort. Not enjoyable at all."
1,Just Terrible,"The artwork was so bad that it was almost impossible to tell what was going on in half the panels. The story was just pure trash. There is not one redeeming feature in Dark Knight Strikes Again. I have no clue why Frank Miller decided to follow up DKR with this garbage. I expected much more when I read this, and was sorely disappointed."
1,"Why, oh why?","Frank, there was just no need. Even if there were, why would you go and spoil the original Dark Knight Returns, one of the most influential comic stories of all time, with a follow-up composed of complete drek? I'm sure the motivation was pure money and I'm sorry that you now have mine."
1,Nothing compared to its predecessor!,"Frank Miller changed the comics world forever by writing the Dark Knight Returns.He changed it back by writing the Dark Knight Strikes Again.This is the worst of Miller's work, completely dwarfed by DKR. There are only 2 interesting parts. The fights, whereas so powerful and thrilling in the Dark Knight Returns, are like biased football matches in the Dark Knight Strikes Again. Batman beats up Superman. Big deal, he did that in DKR.Overall, disappointing and rubbish."
1,"Holy DISAPOINTMENT, Batman!","This half-hearted effort by Miller and Varley leaves one with many questions. For instance:1)What was the point of ralleying the masses in issue two?2)Why are there no BATMAN villains?3)Where did the Legion costumes come from?4)What is the reason for the bizarre characterizations of well-known heroes?5)What do you mean Dick Grayson ""couldn't cut the mustard""? He was Batman's partner for FIFTY YEARS!!!The answer, my friends, is that Miller is too LAZY to care about story and character consistancy, and is contempuous of those who liked his work in the first place.How much will your next comic be, Frank? FIFTY dollars?"
2,"promising, but dissapointing","The Dark Knight Returns blew me away when I first read it, and I still read it at least twice a year.I was very dissapointed by this comic book.First problem,the story makes no sense.I went back to read it to understand it,but I just got a headache.The surprise villain was predictable.Second problem,the artwork is so awful,it looks like a little kid did it.The comic had it's moments,but the characters,the story,and the artwork are not even close to the original.I also didn't like the fact that the ending was so open ended."
2,A little BETTER...,"Frank Miller is at his best when he is choreographing violence. Because he had to wrap up this series, he delivers satisfying fight scenes.But, MAN, where is his story-sense? Between the ""characatures"" of well known television personalities, the unexplained Legion of Super-Heroes costumes, and the BIZARRE characterizations of well-established characters, I got the feeling that Miller was telling a bunch of in-jokes...that only HE was in on.The revelation of the identity of the ""new"" Joker made absolutely NO SENSE! Where is this great army that Batman has spent years training? Why aren't there more BATMAN villains?Varley's coloring is less intrusive than the other issues, but that's not saying much. To get a REAL sense of what Miller and Varley can accomplish together, seek out ELECTRA LIVES AGAIN. After looking at that treasure, you get an idea of how far these two have fallen."
1,Save Yourself,In order to write this review you have to choose at least one star. That's the only reason there is a star above this review.If you've gotten to this review it means that you've read all the others and are hoping for someone to say something good about DK3. Ain't gonna happen. There is nothing good to say about it.I just want to tell all the Dark Night fans out there that haven't read this last chapter to avoid it at all costs. I know you feel like you have to read it but trust me: YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF NOT EVEN LOOKING AT IT.I am a big fan. I consider the Dark Night Returns to be the greatest Batman story ever. I do this out of respect for other Miller fans. It will only hurt you to read DK3 - AVOID IT AT ALL COST!
1,Lets hope this Dark Knight doesn't return,"After reading through this graphic novel you would honestly never believe that The Dark Knight Strikes again was written by the same Frank Miller/comic genius who brought us Batman:Year One & The Dark Knight Returns. This book is just plain amateur in both execution and art work. Giving us a story line revolving more around superman and his struggle to live in Lex Luthors dystopian society and very little of the dark knight that is supposedly striking back. Miller's art work's Neon coloring and sloppy at best pencil work, just hurts the eyes at times. Once you reach the end of this book you feel like a cheap prom date left at the end of the night feeling confused and taken advantage of by someone you thought you could trust."
1,Believe the Low-Star ratings!,"Normally, you'd have to convince me this P.O.S had anything to do with Batman...let alone Frank Miller. This is bad. Real bad. Artwork is missing the detail and depth, storyline is real confusing as it introduces new (but old DC Justice League characters) at random and doesn't build their characters. Just altogether goofy and I can't see the relationship between DKR and this DKSA sequel. Seems like he went to the well one too many times on this one...If you want a good one, get ""The Complete Frank Miller Batman"" Leatherbound Hardcover with Batman: Year One, Santa Claus Wanted Dead or Alive and Dark Knight Returns."
2,Very poorly done sequel,"This is possibly Millers worst comic book. The art is simply very poorly done. Its very hurried and its very obviously a complete hack job. It is very clear that he did this book simply to cash in and that he did not put forth any kind of effort. He made a terrible decision to ink his own work in this, its one of the worst inking jobs that I have ever seen. The story is good, plotwise, but the ending and the twists are really just plain silly. Batman simply comes off as a bad charicature of Millers previous version. His new Robin is boring. His Superman is a dope. Wonder Woman is goofy and way too over the top. This is quite possibly Millers worst work. It may be worth a read, but I dont think anyone who objectively reads this book is going to think that it was even decent. Im being generous by giving it 2 stars."
2,Too over the top,"The first Frank Miller Batman had it all: amazing characters, incredible pathos and drama, interesting situations and a showdown between rules right and rogue right. This book, not so much.Each character is a mere shape of an idea, not even a shadow. For example, Superman in the first book was dedicated to rules, liberty and the concept that all people should be protected by power. Even after a horrible nuclear attack, Superman still stands by the establishment. Batman is the personification of liberty, justice and responsibility on the individual level. When the entire city is burning, he forms a fire fighting brigade to combat the flames. In this book, you never see any character growth or development.Read the first book. Avoid this one..."
3,It's time for revolution,"Comparatively, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is for sure much better than ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"": the first one is more elaborated, planned, well-written than the second one. Nonetheless, even with all of its problems, I don't think it's a complete waste of money and time: ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"" has something to say about revolution, about taking a stand, about our modern day. If not for the ""Dick Grayson"" thing, I could even give 4 stars to it."
1,Total Disappointment and damn near incomprehensible,"It's hard to believe this graphic novel was written by the same author who wrote the brilliant TDK REturns. The artwork is sloppy and disgusting, the writing is terrible, the dialogue is cheesy, Batman is completely out of character that you can't believe that such a comic was approved. And the structure of the writing and plot make the novel damn near incomprehensible to read, there were total sections where I literally had no idea what had happened or even who was talking. The biting political criticism and satire of TV commentary is gone now replaced by an imitation which attempts to evoke the same level of wit and brilliance but is sadly nothing more but a pale attempt.I don't know what happened to Frank but it seems he just doesnt care anymore and is banking on his name alone."
1,Absolute trash,"I loved the the dark knight returns and this so called follow up was just a huge disappointment. This story is all over the place uneventful and uninspired. It's filled with crappy dialogue and stupid twists, I didn't care at all about any of the characters and sometimes the writing was just completely uncomfortable and the artwork is total crap and feels like some one did it in a day. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one read the dark knight returns an stop there this is not worth your time."
3,I wish I could love this however.....,"The illustrations they stink, I wish I had a more eloquent way to describe it but they stink . And it's a little jumpy in the way it's written. This could have been done so much better, with the story they had SMH"
2,HUH?,"Let me start off by saying The Dark Knight Returns is one of the best story lines ever created. The Dark Knight Strikes Again does not even feel like it was written by the same person. The book has striking visuals, but it ends there. No story to go along with the pretty pictures. Batman plays a supporting role in a Superman book, as the leader of a terrorist organization. Book One is complete garbage, hard to follow. Does not get much better as you continue to read. Contains about a quarter the dialogue as The Dark Knight Returns. Very disappointed by this book."
2,more style than substance!,"Considering how brilliant THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS was,THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN turned out to be a major disappointment.The story was messy,muddled and hardly engaging,Millers art a hotch potch of doodles and colours!Still worth a look but all in all not a memorable read!"
1,Beyond a disappointment,"OKAY,I wasn't a big fan of the original 1986 ""DK Returns"": Miller's weirdo beardo, drug influenced art (enough vampired teeth already!!), a female Robin, Bats with a gun.Yet, I concur, that book changed comic books forever, even more that the brilliant Neil Adams in the 1970's. But I still liked the detective solving of Batman, used his mind instead of his fists.So, I was sort of interested when the long-awaited sequel of DKR came: DK Strikes Back. Whatta train wreck. Miller went overboard on distoted art, confusing and convoluted story-telling. It was really a piece of garbage. I wouldn't give the book to my pet rat for chewing fuel. Sorry, Miller, why don't you take more 'Shrooms!!!I was told the original concluding book was delayed for 4 months due to poor orders on the first and second issues."
3,Is it Superman or Batman?,"What the hell, is this story suppossed to be about Superman or batman? This second part is not as good as the first one. It is more about Superman and other DC characters than Batman himself and in the end it doesn't make any sense. I guess, I have to read it again to undestand. Okay, if you are a Batman fan, like myself, but don't pay full price for it."
2,Not as good as the Dark Knight Returns,"I'm sad to say that this over-hyped sequel doesn't live up to its billing. It has interesting ideas in it, but doesn't follow through on them to the same degree as Dark Knight Returns."
3,A comic pro weighs in,"Been working in comics since 1978, and I was surprised to see this 2nd volume. I bought both 1 & 2 and started 2 with the anticipation of a good story, only to be disappointed with flashy pages, poor layouts, and a story that fails in it's attempt to reproduce the thrill and angst of volume 1. Maybe it's the lack of Klaus Janson, but the 'background' characters took over the book and Batman seemed to 'go along for the ride'. The art was even more uncharacteristically gritty than Miller turns out. I think the story was reaching and heady, and not really a suitable companion to the brilliance of volume 1."
2,My expectations were rivaled only by my disappointment.,"After reading Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I couldn't wait to read B:tDKSA. As I said, my expectations could only be rivaled by my utter and complete disappointment. In this novel, it seems that Frank Miller enlisted the help of others, which was a collosal mistake. There are portions of the novel that are obviously done by Frank Miller (I say ""obviously"" because those parts of the novel are FREAKING AMAZING!) and other parts that look like they are done by some hobo Miller just took home with him one day. I could be wrong, but it seems like there is a vast portion of this novel that Frank Miller had nothing to do with, and those parts suck. The two stars were only given because there are some really great aspects of this novel, but they are generally buried by a mound of total and utterly annoying crap."
3,I liked it but...,"The original ""Dark Night Returns"" was a book that was accessbile to most people because the main characters were iconic. I remember loaning the book to my girlfriend at the time and she actually enjoyed it (thats saying quite a bit). However, this book is only Ok for Frank Miller fans and requires that you have familiarity with the rest of the DC Universe. The artwork and writing seem a bit rushed. I think Frank Miller was trying too hard to be Frank Miller. There are some good moments in the story, I liked the interaction between the Batman and Flash. However, Frank Miller's depiction of Lex Luthor fell well short of the job he did with the Joker's character in the previous book. It is worth buying only because mediocre Frank Miller is still better than most other comic book writers out there."
2,Photoshopped to Death,"I was interested in picking this up having enjoyed Dark Knight Returns back in the day, however I'm glad I took a look at this first. The art is almost destroyed by the garish photoshop colouring and effects. This was done around 2000 I think, but whatever the case it looks really dated in 2006. It reminds me of the kind of work someone who just learned enough of photoshop to go wild experimenting might do. I just found it really depressing because it ruined the otherwise great linework of Miller.As for the actual story let others who could make it through be the judge. I can't fairly say."
1,Destroys the great work of its predecessor.,"After the Dark Knight Returns I looked forward to this book, had no idea the horrifying tale I exposed my eyes to. The plot is so convoluted I had to read the plot summary on Wikipedia to understand what I just read, the art style changes from amateurish to rushed drunken scribbles on a bar napkin. It seems as if Frank Miller was angry to have to write this book and set out to not ruin, but defile every DC character you know and loved with complete asinine, ridiculous and pointless character designs that only the rejected patients of mental institutes would find appealing. Its so bad it makes you feel worse for being exposed to it, it makes you feel dirty, wrong and defiled, avoid at all costs, if your options are reading this and gouging your eyes out with a pair of rusty salad tongs, go for the tongs."
3,weak,"First I should say that Miller's the Dark Knight Returns is one of my favorite pieces of literature. It is exquisite, but the sequel is rather weak. The art isn't anywhere near as good as the original. The story had some good moments but was overall way too heavy handed. Miller felt the neeed to beat us over the head with the point he was making. I prefer to forget about this graphic novel and end the Batman saga with DKR."
1,Frank Miller Flushes a Legend Down the Toliet,"Frank! What have you done to the legendary Dark Knight of myth? I read the original ""Dark Knight"" Returns in the 80's when it came out in its 4-book series, and whoa, it blew me away. It is hard to believe the same author wrote this piece of ... Instead of the classic and twisted Batman villians we get two Superman chumps and Robin. The original DK was a profound statement of justice vs. the law, government vs. vigilantism, pop psychology vs. common sense, and many other themes. There was no supervillians; the villians were more a symptom than a disease. This ham-handed cop out deserves nothing more that a funeral in my toliet, suitably adorned with some ... material. Oh for the days of ""Sin City"", Daredevil ""Born Again"". Frank, you let us down."
2,Failed experiment,"Herky-jerky plot. No real time spent on any characters. Inclusion of way too many silly characters (e.g. Plasticman). None of the supporting cast (e.g. Superchix, reporters, etc) ever get a personality. The world is some bizzare mix of the DKR world and the Marshal Law world.I had heard that this was bad, but didn't think it could be this bad. I wish I'd never read it."
1,"Avoid at all costs, but buy Dark Knight Returns","This is a follow on from Dark Knight Returns which in my opinion is the finest grapic novel of all time. But, this follow up is terrible, lousy grapics, lousy story (is there a story in there, I couldnt see it?).I wouldnt be interested in seeing this again if I was the last dung beatle on earth.Miller, you should be ashamed."
3,"Not bad, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor.","I liked the dark knight returns quite a bit, but the follow up was just a little over the top. There were really two things i didn't like about the first. I don't love the illustration style, and i thought some parts of it were a little too fantastical. The dark knight rides again has the same illustration style, but seems even more fantastical. It just doesn't seem like it takes place in this world, or even some alternate version of this world. It isn't a bad graphic novel by any means, but I just expected more after reading the dark knight returns, and the watchman. It is worth reading, but you may want to get something else instead. I definitely like the killing joke and batman year one much more than this."
1,Just so very disappointing,"I cut my teeth on The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One. I've been debating for years whether or not to read this and finally found it cheap enough that I bought it.Good grief...it's just plain awful.If you love DKR and Year One, then do yourself a favor and forget this one even exists.It makes no sense at all. The ending is....pathetic. Just....just pretend it all ended in Dark Knight Returns and be happy with a little bit of mystery in your mythos.What a waste."
1,He swings...and a miss,"I purchased this book after reading ""Year One"", ""The Dark Knight Returns"", ""The Long Halloween"", ""Dark Victory"" and ""Batman: Hush""...When I read ""Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again"" I was very disappointed I feel like I wasted my money and I could have have bought another Batman book. From the art to the mediocre story, this is a major let down; I feel that the only reason to purchase this book is because you wish to collect an abundant amount of Batman books."
1,I think Miller farted this one out,"This is a disappointment. If you read the original , don't bother comparing it. Not that you should expect the same old thing since the original was a classic that cannot be repeated. This sequel seemed like a mere pretense of being a Dark Knight sequel. While reading it I got the feeling that Miller was just fooling arond and making up the story as he went along. Majority of the pages are filled of talking heads giving useless commentary about the world instead of dealing with the story. Borrow it from a friend or your library."
1,Unbelievably Awful!,"If you liked ""The Dark Knight Returns"" don't think that means you'll like this. The art is shoddy, the plot is meaningless, the characters are so poorly developed that they bear no resemblance to the characters they're based on. Don't bother."
1,This was a waste of money and time,"I loved the original Dark Knight. Batman's always been my favorite hero of all time, but this series just [was weak]. The first two weren't bad. Terribly confusing, but all the T&A superchicks stuff was a waste of ink and paper space that could have gone into telling the real story. This third and final - thankfully - made no sense at all. It was so much filler and [poor quality]. It was like trying to read a story where 3 out of 5 pages was missing. Read the first two, and make up your own ending. Don't bother to read this one."
1,I wish I had the option of ZERO STARS,"I like ironic detatchment as much as the next guy, but Miller went waaaaaay too far in this story.It is fine to exhibit contempt for one's characters and the medium in which one works, but it is too much to show hatred for one's audience as well.The message of Mr. Miller's superhero comic is: ""superheroes comics are stupid, superheroes are stupid and, if you are reading this, you're stupid too.""Sometimes I agree, but I neither waste so many trees saying it nor charge so much for the privilege of being insulted."
2,Yikes... not that good.,"This book was painful. The art made me cringe on just about every page. There are some good panels, but some look like they were drawn by a 2nd grader. I know Frank Miller is capable of better.The story was Ok. It wasn't anything earth shattering, and a lot of it was predictable. I know the characters in this story are supposed to be separate from the characters in regular DC continuity, but some of the characterizations were bad (Superman and ""Joker"" were the worst). I won't go too much into this as it would require me to spoil certain parts of the story.I went in with an open mind and came out thoroughly disappointed. There are a lot of good Batman stories out there (Batman Year One, The Killing Joke, The Dark Knight Returns, and anything written by Paul Dini), this just isn't one of them."
2,Deplorable artwork.,"Having recently devoured Absolute Batman:Hush, I was excited when purchasing this title. Normally I never buy anything thats wrapped in plastic, unless flipping through it first. After getting Darkknight home, and openning it up, I nearly lost my mind. The art work is deplorable, it looks as if an eleven yro child produced this book. While I understand frank millers claims to have wanted to keep the images gritty, theres a fine line between grit and [...]. Skip this title, and purchase Absolute Hush instead."
2,The Dark Knight Strikes Out,"There's a Tony Millionaire quote on this book's small inner jacket flap: ""This book looks like it was done by a guy with a pen and his girlfriend with an iMac."" That's about the best compliment this book deserves. If truth in advertising were the standard they'd mention that the pen was applied sparsely and quite sloppily, and that the girlfriend is probably new to computers and given to horrible, eye-straining experimentation with already-overused Photoshop filters.Come on, all you Frank Miller apologists, get real. There is simply no excuse. Sure, nobody expected this thing to be as innovative and influential as Dark Knight Returns, but when the preproduction sketches at the end of the book have more care put into them than any given page in the finished story, it's time to hold Frank Miller accountable.2 stars only because of the much-deserved scathing commentary on life under the illegitimate Bush regime. Then again, I question whether Miller even intended this."
1,Couldn't leave well enough alone.,"Disappointing sequels are nothing new, but I have a hard time coming up with an example in any medium where the disparity between an original's quality and the follow-up's is so incredibly wide. Dark Knight Returns was Miller at his peak, Strikes Again is like a 13-year-old's idea of making fun of it. The dialogue is laughable, the drama is boring at best, the art gives no reason why it should stretch over expansive full pages the way it does. I'm an optimistic, forgiving person, but really there's almost no excusing such overindulgent, ill-advised trash as this.I'm a huge fan of the original, and even other work by Miller, but don't waste a nickel on this. His awful ""All-Star Batman & Robin"" run really shouldn't have been a surprise after this. Heck, if nothing else, Batman fans should stay away because he's hardly even a character in the book."
2,Completely Pointless Anime,"This anime (if that is what they call it) is way out of the borderline of what anime really is about. First of all it is by all means a lack of plot. Well there is a plot, but it is completely pointless. What I mean is that this anime has had the most annoying characters in the ever. There so annoying that all I could do is either return this DVD or maybe - just maybe skip a couple of episodes to see if something cool might happen. But it didn`t work at all. This series was a waste of money. I only bought it because I heard it was really cool and original and so that made me want to buy it. I think I may have learned my lesson on listening to these propagandas, is that not every single word they say is true that if a series is said to be really good in characters, plots, story, etc. Because in the end you are the only critic to give your conclusions or reviews."
5,A fantastic addition to the 4-piece placesetting,These beautiful bread plates are a wonderful compliment to the Pfaltzgraff placesettings. I love the interesting shape and rounded edges. These are adorable little plates.
3,An absorbing tale of cultural values.,"This is a story set in both Hong Kong and America. It is, at surface, the story of cookbook author Emily Kerr and her lost daughter, Lam Fong. However there is much more to be explored in this absorbing tale of cultural values. A read for those who can appreciate cultural difference and similarity.Leann Arndt, Reviewer"
3,Only the tower is worthy,"I bought it because I wanted the Atgar 1.4 FD P-Tower, but the action figure sucks big time. Action figure gets 1 star. The tower gets 5 stars.Face detail: Looks like plastic manOverall Body detail: GoodFabric clothes: N/AAccesories: Atgar 1.4 FD P-TowerMovie accuracy: GoodIssues: Lack of poseability of action figure.Benchmarking: N/A.PoseabilityShoulder articulation: StandardElbow articulation: NoHip articulation: StandardKnees articulation: NoFeet articulation: NoNotice I use this nomenclature for articulations.No: It has no articulation.Standard: Rotates around a single axis. Provides limited poseability.Ball: Provides the best poseability."
3,Ripping!,"I bought these for under the booster seats to protect our chair seats from our kids. The work and fit fine, I, not sure about the ties in the back. They seem like they might break off, but they haven't so far. Also- the front just kinda laps over, but doesn't stick to itself.so it's a little looser then I would prefer. But again, they do protect and serve their purpose!UPDATE: while it's still working, the plastic is ripping at the corner. I'm debating trying to repair it r cut if off salvaging as much of it to keep the set covered as possible!"
3,Ok for messy adults like me,"Not exactly what I hoped for. Ordered one that is slightly too small for chairs. Also, the side slit design doesn't really hold the protector in place. Probably wouldn't recommend for pets, but OK for young children or messy adults like me."
1,Deceptive,Not a 'cover' at all. Just a cheap piece of plastic that has to be tied onto chair and then doesn't fit correctly. Worth less than a dollar. Total scam.
5,Love it,"Exactly what I was looking for and cover the entire chair, very important. I will purchasing another.Definitely would recommend this item."
2,Flawed,It does not fit a normal size seat. Should have used elastic to hold it down to the seat instead of the plastic ties.
3,Plastic Dining Chair Covers,"I do like the fact that it actually does cover my chairs... But the fit is not too flattering. Grant it, my chairs have different dimensions than the ones shown in the example picture. They cover enough around the chairs... I can get over the bulky tie around the back of the chairs. But, the lose fit around the corners...ouch. I just wished the corners had some kind of snap or something to secure a more refined look. After all, people buy these plastic coverings to preserve and protect their good looking and tasteful chairs."
2,Didn't meet my expectation,"I expected the product to more organized in terms of being able to wrap it around my chair, which I still haven't gotten to do. At the moment, I just have it on top of the chair, but it falls off occasionally. I'll try few more things and if the useability improves, then I'll increase my rating. As of now, I'll keep it at 2 stars as I expected much more for the price!"
4,Life Saver - Thank You!,I ordered the clear vinyl chair protectors because I have white chairs and a black cat. These protectors are going to save my chairs from all of the black cat hair. Thank you!
2,Not that good,"Vinyl is too small for my chairs.Vinyl does not mold to front and sides of chairs.Rear ties do not hold cover to rear of chair.When someone sits on chair,vinyl easily moves and folds."
4,Saves my expensive fabric,"We've had these for a while now. While they dont fit our chairs perfectly, they certainly protect them perfectly. We have had many family dinners now with these on and after each one, I am so glad I have these. Nice dining chairs are expensive. These protectors are not. They stay on all of the time. I wouldnt want to host a dinner without these on my chairs!"
3,Better than nothing,"I am ordering my second pair. They're ok, nothing great. Our first ones lasted about a half year before the ties started tearing off. I wish they were made to stay on. Mom and Dad's were nicer; more fitted with trim but these are good because our chairs are oversized and they allow room."
3,Chair Cover,Product as shown on the ad. Difficult to figure-out how to put it on the chairs though...A booklet on instructions would be helpful.
5,plastic chair cover review,These chair covers are essential with small children dining on your nice chairs. They were well priced and arrived promptly in excellent condition.
4,Chair Covers,I think they serve the purpose I bought them. I would have liked them to be a little bigger. They do keep the cat hair off the chairs and that is what I wanted.
3,they're ok,"You get what you pay for with this product. Both covers tore a the corners and one tie broke off. In all fairness they do get heavy use; I use them under my kids booster seats. But still, you'd think they'd last longer than six months."
2,Some day someone will invent a real chair cover,"These covers are just ok. This is the second time I've purchased them. The straps will eventually break.The funny thing is, I didn't realize I was buying the same ones as last time. I was looking for something better. Why is it so hard to find good strong chair covers (that are clear)?? I search all over the web and come up with very little.Would I buy these again? Probably, since I can't find anything better. My complaint with these is the slits in all four corners. They are there so that they can open up at the corners of your chairs. The problem is that each little slit will open and expose your chairs cushions (or whatever is underneath)."
1,Never received the product,"We never received this product. We can't rate a product we never received. We sent an inquiry back to you stating this fact and we have yet to receive a response back. We would like our money refunded or the product. I gave it a one star because the e-mail would not accept a rating of no stars.Upset,J.C."
4,Messy kids? Here's the answer.,"I just finished having the chairs in my kitchen re-upholstered. My kids are just kids--they spill. So, I ordered these vinyl chair covers to protect the new fabric. They certainly do the job. Not only are they designed to tailor-fit any chair, can be tied securely in place, they simply wipe clean. Best of all, they are very inexpensive. This is one of the best purchases I'll ever make!!"
4,"good value, hard to find","believe it or not, I searched domestic store websites and stores for months before I finally found these, I wanted something that would protect the fabric, not just cover it, these are great, and I use nicer looking covers on top. They don't stay in place well with the bigger chairs I have, but they are better than nothing, and I just adjust them after the kids get in and out of the chairs, and they're fine, they are find in the chairs that the kids don't climb in and out of. Good buy, buy it."
3,"Keeps the chair clean, but . . .","I like that these covers do keep the kids chairs clean, but they don't stay tied and they didn't lay nicely along the front of the chair. I had to use some packing tape on mine to make fitted corners so that the covers didn't stick out and move all around when getting on and off the chair. I'm not comforable taking my nice chairs apart like one of the other reviews suggested, so these will have to do for now. They serve their purpose, but I'm still looking for a better alternative."
3,vinly chair cover,They are durable but did not fit my chairs perfectly since my seats are large but after some adjustments they worked better. They are not the most attractive on my chairs but they suit the purpose.
4,Nice cover for chairs,"I just had my dining room chairs recovered and did not want to have stains, so I purchased these covers and they work very well. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that the ties are not the best. I attached each tie together using two-sided tape and so far they have stayed."
2,Don't stay in place,"We bought a cover for our cream dining chair for our 3 year old to sit on. They don't stay in place and the ties loosen repeatedly so that he can easily untie and pull it off or just pull it up and out of the way. It looks messy on - I knew it would look like a plastic cover - but it's very bunched and loose. I was hoping it would work, but ended up being a waste of money. We're going to just end up recovering the chairs in a more kid friendly fabric."
3,Not as good as I was expecting,"The plastic is heavy enough, but they don't fit the chair well and need some tweaking. I had gotten these chairs from my mother, who had two plastic covers out of 6, and needed 4 more. Hers were much, much nicer, fit better and had a velcro tie to keep them together. These stick out all around and make the chairs look a bit cheap. They do not fit as nicely as in the picture."
4,Good for the Money,"These covers are good for our family because of the toddlers. The excess strips of plastic that hang down are fun for the cat, but unnecessary for the rest of us.Once we discovered how to unscrew the chair pads, we were ready to roll!"
3,Not perfect but does the job,"Bought these to protect our cloth kitchen chairs from my kids. They cover them up but slide around and don't stay in place well. Tying vinyl straps is difficult and I end up doing it over a lot, plus the front flaps don't stick together as shown. Better than nothing but far from ideal."
4,Functional but not very transportable,"I ordered this for an athletic banquet and it worked well. My one concern is storage and transport. If I had to do it over again, I would order a scmaller screen so I could store it with more ease and transport it without carrying such an awkward piece."
5,Solid product,"Am overall very happy with this screen. It is solidly made and a nice size. It is a bit heavy though and the instructions for using it aren't as clear as they could be, but are good enough."
3,3rd leg,"Fine, but one of the tripod legs sticks out perpendicular to the screen, pushing it minimum 2 feet away from the closest wall."
5,Huge,"Very nice, much larger than I envisioned, Looks good and is sturdy. Arrive on time and without any damages. I would recommend to my friends,-."
3,Denon DVM 1805,"Purchased this to be both a CD changer and a DVD Player. The sound is good and the video is great. Unfortunately, the system has no sequential play mode between disks even though it holds five. If you put five CD's in for instance, you can only play one CD then it stops. To play the next CD you have to physically tell the player to switch to the next CD and start it. The same problem occurs with DVD's so for instance if you have a 2-CD Lord of the Rings, it will not sequentially play the second DVD. This is a bummer as I've come to expect better from Denon."
2,problems with Kindle version,"This book has very helpful content, but problems in the Kindle version. These include lack of page numbers, no search capability, misformatting (especially in tables & citations), & no page numbers in the index, which makes the index unusable. I wound up returning the Kindle version & buying a printed version."
3,Not quite sure.,"This book definitely did its job in some respects. It's stuffed full of information about semantics and does an okay job at least touching on most of the linguistic issues in dealing with semantics. However, reading this book one gets the feeling that it might not have been written for linguists (it almost feels like a philosophy textbook at times). As I said before, while it does manage to touch on many topics it often leaves many questions unanswered. The book is also sometimes dry enough to be called plain boring.It's definitely a good book with loads of information, but not necessarily the best place to find answers to your questions about semantics."
2,Can you say cryptic?,"If I recall correctly, Saeed writes in his intro that this book does not assume any real prior knowledge of semantics. This, however, must be a cruel joke on his part, because I (read: student with some linguistic experience) found this book to be dense, cryptic, snobbish, and generally inaccessible. Granted, semantics isn't really a pick-up-and-go subject, but I can't help but feel that the book is awfully heavy for an ostensible ""introduction""."
4,"Nice, but shorter than 70""","Although it is listed as 70"" high, it actually measured to be 68"" which was a slight disappointment. Due to its size and weight, I will not return it. I am satisfied with the quality and it will suit my needs well enough."
1,Waste of money for the gullible,AudioQuest are milking foolish and ignorant consumers with this one. You can buy a 2m HDMI cable that will perform exactly the same for 1/50 the price right here on Amazon.
3,"Nice looking, but not very sturdy","When we first put this together it would not align properly. It was off just a slight turn, which drove me nuts and proved to be the downfall of the table. We've had it for 3 years and our 10 year-old son and my father used it mostly. Though my 2 year also was very interested in playing with the chess pieces whenever they were out. (The pieces we bought didn't fit in the very thin drawers.) Moving it or leaning on it at all caused it to wiggle. Over time it was just so wobbly and lose it's become a hazard. We are tossing it in the morning. Plus, it arrived with a crack in the pole. We just didn't want to deal with the hazard of sending it back.I gave it three stars be it is a very pretty cherry. It's heavy. And if you get one that's cut properly, I could see where it might last. It just didn't work out for our family."
3,Decent sea-going adventure,"I'll give Porter Hill credit for one thing--he took a different tack (pun intended) for his Adam Horne character. Horne's not a great icon in the Hornblower/Aubrey tradition, and he's not even in the Royal Navy.In this book, we meet the basic characters that appear in this and two other books. It's sort of a Hornblower-meets-Dirty-Dozen story of a ragtag group of convicts given a second chance on a risky mission.The story is paced very quickly, which is probably a good thing, since the writing isn't terribly strong, nor is the plotting all that great. But it's decent escapist fare, and if like me you've read (and read and read) CS Forester and Patrick O'Brian and just need something else to entertain you, this isn't a bad choice.Certainly of Porter Hill's trilogy, this is the strongest entry."
4,"Small, short book on an interesting topic","I got this for a friend who has native beach grasses instead of a traditional lawn, and she was able to glean useful information out of it. It's a very short book, and it doesn't cover every climate possible, but it also doesn't set out to do that. There are plenty of good alternative ideas for your lawn. I recommend this to anyone who wants to conserve water, do something natural, or try something a little different."
3,grass is growing,interesting capture of natural grasses...the book provided realistic alternative suggestions to make a lovely yard...and I'm no Martha Stewart!
1,Poor performance and value,"The output of this flashlight is LESS than that of the built-in illuminator. It is also not very uniform. You can actually see the image of the LED chip in the field of view.The illuminator on Yukon NVMT scopes is VERY good. Bright, uniform, and with a crisp edge. It is just a bit small for the field of view of my 3x model.There is no advantage to using this flashlight, except that it will not drain the scope's battery."
5,Love them,"These bags are just the right size for fresh produce. Very well made, and I was pleased with the fast delivery.I will peruse their site to see what other Eco friendly products they have to offer."
1,Pretty But Don't Prolong Life of Fruits and veggies ini Frig,"These bags are ""pretty"" but they do absolutely NOTHING toward extending the life of veggies and fruit in the refrigerator. Leave veggies in these bags in the frig more than a few days and they come out dehydrated. Some veggies actually deteriorate faster, such as leafy greens. They may be more ""eco"" because one can take them to the store, but that is the only purpose they serve. Extended life of produce is not one of their strong points."
4,EcoSac Reusable Produce Bags,"The bags are very nice - sturdy, washable. However, my local grocery stores have trouble determining how to enter the tare weight into their cash register. As reusable bags become more common, this will improve. However, I now have to explain to each checker."
5,Reusable Bliss,"I love these produce bags. I purchased 4 of them. They're almost perfect. The only drawback is that the cashier has trouble seeing the sticker through the weave of the bag to figure out which produce item is being purchased. If I had thought about it, I would have gotten something more see-through. I purchased these because they seemed like they might be sturdier than the other options available. I'd buy it again."
4,"Nice bags, didn't work out so well.","I like the bags. They're sturdy and big enough for all my produce needs.The weight on the tag for taring out is great in theory, but didn't work out for me. Took them to two local stores and was told it wasn't possible at both. If the bags were lighter, maybe I wouldn't mind paying for them, but then the quality wouldn't be the same. The bags weigh 1.47 oz (0.09 lb). So, if you're buying something that's $3/lb, you'd be paying $0.27 extra. Not gonna do it.I'll still use them for things like potatoes and apples that are easy to take out and weigh, or when I buy things sold by count and not weight. But I am disappointed."
2,Not really that great.,"It was a bit of an upgrade when i bought it, but then i saw cheaper cards that were better. The games lag at near high settings, and crashes when you run it at 1440 by 900 res. Plus if your running it on vista it gives you BSOD (blue screen of death)every time you shut down or log off. Buy the 8800 GS its only $100 and it give every thing this card does 10x better."
5,i wear animal skins..................,I wear all kinds of animals skins. I luv lepard skins. I also love bear skin parkas in winter because i live in such cold conditions here where i am (i amnt in north america or europe i can speak english) my fam. is rich so i get what i want!!!! i eat big jucy stakes. i also eat wild dog and horse meat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so i am better than you?NOT?{Loucial^
1,This Review DONE BY A BRATZ FAN!,"no!!!!!!! mga, how could you let bratz look so bad in front of everyone? this doll wears a bra, fur coat, and snakeskin pants and high-heels! don't buy this - buy bratz candyz instead! bratz candyz and tokyo and wintertime and sportz and beach and sun-kissed summer are so much better! and my scene and barbie!"
2,Uh? Who let in the creature from the underworld?,"Oh My God! People areraving about how pretty she is and how she is the best out of the Fabulous Collection! Please. She looks freaky. I mean her hair is too blonde and her clothes... blah! They are so inapropiate! I mean, a short pants (or skirt?)with tall boots and a tank-top that says "" DIVA"". So not worth the money! I mean, who ever said she was pretty must be blind! So please don't waste your $$$$$$$$$ on this ugly putrid doll!"
4,Fabulous!,"I collect Bratz and find there unique looks and style so very fabulous and just got this doll. I also read the other reviews and sorta agree with the fact that when you take off her (fake) fur coat her skimpy tube top is a little too skimpy. I didn't enjoy that. But those of you who are complaining about the animal fur and skin, I think that's kinda ridiculous, it's just a doll. I love the shoes she comes with they are so fab and stylish. She comes with beautiful silver chandelier earings with I adore and find super fab too! I wasn't impressed with her hair it was too dull. But overall she is fabulous! xD I do recommend this doll to any bratz lovers!-MaRiA"
1,EWWWW,Oh my gosh! She is wearing almost nothing! If you people think that is beautiful...I don't want to know what kind of kid you are. Bratz are really gross in a big way. In that outfit i know what she'll be gettin. a free bed and (maybe) breakfast
5,"So far, it's wonderful","I am 53. My hot flashes started about a year ago, escalating to sweat pouring out of me. I did not want to go on HRT. I was willing to endure but what an annoyance. A friend of mine (her husband is a doctor) recommended Estroven. Ran around looking for it, could only find it on AMAZON. Estroven has diminished my hot flashes completely. I have been on it for 6 weeks. Just within the last week though I can slightly feel if I am having a hot flash. I really hope Estroven keeps working. It's very distracting to be experiencing hot flashes."
1,Misleading,"The dosage is two capsules daily, in the 28-count box the dosage is one capsule daily.Estroven, Maximum Strength, 28-Count Box"
5,"great price, great product","This was the best price for the quantity. Less expensive than in retail stores.Also, I found that when I stopped taking this product my night sweats returned with a vengence. It does take a few weeks to start working."
1,Misleading Product,I bought this product because it was more affordable and looked like the same product I had previously purchased by Sun Flower Market. It is not the same product and doesn't work the way the real Estroven Product has in the past. Please be aware of this product!
1,Worthless,"I was astonished at the good ratings for this product. It did nothing for me personally, and my gynecologist concurred with me that it was a waste of my money. If you're tempted to try it, please make sure you get it on sale, and if it works for you, I'm glad to be wrong for your sake."
3,Estroven,"I don't know if this product works but I think it might.. Anyway, no harm done. No negative side effects and it may be improving my symptoms."
1,This product is a stimulant,"I read the box , which mentioned nothing about caffeine, and took a pill before bed. I was up all night wide awake due to this. I read online later some comments about the fact that it contains caffeine. However their website does not mention caffeine or the stimulating effects of the product. I'd like to know how much caffeine is in this stuff. I'm sensitive to caffeine and not happy they don't list that this product has a stimulating effect. Lost a night of sleep. Won't take the product again."
5,Works great for me and I'm 39!,"I started menopause symptoms when I was about 36 - now, at 39, they are really kicking in: night sweats, mood swings, etc. I can honestly say this works. For the money, I'll stick with this!"
1,Estroven maximum strength doesn't work,I have been faithfully using this product for 7 weeks now and notice zero percent improvement in my hot flashes in the day and the night sweats at night. Last night was the worst I have ever had. This was a total waste of money for me.
3,OK if it's what you need,"I really just want a powerfull jet function so I can blast the leaves and needles off my rhody and pine bushes. This didn't do it. All the other settings might be usefull for someone else. Also it leaked right out of the package, I had to put in a new washer."
1,Broke after two months,"Was great at first but after less than two months, it drips even when the handle is not pressed and the spray patterns are not as focused as they used to be."
1,Bad leak after 4 months,This is the second of the multi-spray nozzles I have purchased. Both have started leaking within months -- this one in 4 months.
2,Doesn't Last Long,"I've used this about 6 months. After about 4 months of frequent use, it would get stuck ""on"" constantly. A little WD-40 helped, but not for too long. Then, a short ~1-2 foot drop to the sidewalk cause the whole head to break off. (Cheap plastic)Not much great here... perhaps all sprayers like this stink though?"
1,not made in USA,This product is not made in the USA. You should take it off your page that says it is. I called the factory to confirm it.
3,Fine but I was hoping for more,"While the quality seems good enough, it'll take more than half a season to see if this thing lasts.I am pretty disappointed by the soaker setting. Imagine filling your mouth half way with water, and then opening your mouth. That's what you get. It just runs down all over your hand and arm. And yes, I have it completely ""locked in"" (click) to that setting.I wish there was a ""full"" setting like most garden hose nozzles have. The lack of this setting has me still looking for a good nozzle.I use mostly ""shower"" (watering plants), ""center"" (filling things up and watering plants farther away), and ""jet."" The jet setting doesn't seem as strong as my last hose nozzle."
1,Leaks after less than a month,"I bought this in the berry. It is really solid and is holding up well with all of the watering I am doing during the drought we are currently in. Highly recommend.Will update my review if there are issues.Update and Ratings Change: 7/17/2012- After less than a month, this sprayer stopped working effectively. At first, I noticed less pressure coming out of the sprayer. I chalked it up to reduced pressure due to the drought in our area. Then, the sprayer started a slow leak from the bottom followed by a significant, shooting spray from the bottom. I rinsed it out and attempted to trouble-shoot but couldn't find anything I could do to correct the issue. I switched to another sprayer and had full pressure etc. It is a shame. This little sprayer seemed really well-made. Perhaps it is just the one I had."
2,Decent but one setting is a dud,I just purchased this item. It shows up quickly but one of the setting is a total dud. Definitely not a good sign for a low-tech product which has been around for decades.
4,Solid Hoze Nozzle,"Have used mine for about 3 months and so far it is very solid. Good selection of sprays, feels well built, and minimal leaking. Will have to see how the plastic spray adjuster holds up (that has been the weak point on other nozzles I have owned)."
3,Nozzle started to drip quickly after first use,"Where I live, the water is soft and the problems started happening shortly after I purchased this product. No matter how I attempted to adjust the spray pattern, it started to drip from the nozzle.This disappointed me greatly because the sprayer appeared to be well constructed, with heavy materials. I also must admit I was a sucker for the great color."
5,Great garden tool,This nozzle has a nice variety of spray options. I have used it to spray-wash my terrace and water and mist my plants. All of the spray patterns work well. The dial makes it easy to change the pattern and the trigger-lock works great. The pistol grip is a nice size for a woman's hand.
3,Good quality but a bit smaller than I expected,It looks more robust than the one I got before from home depot. It would be great if the nozzle head is a bit bigger.
2,Iffy,This nozzle does the job but tends to leak on certain settings. I have other nozzles that are better - the quality isn't great and I wouldn't recommend.
2,Only good for one season,"This is a nice hose nozzle with a good selection of patterns including ""soaker"" which is great for water plants and trees. The only problem is it last for one year and then leaks, just like the other reviewer had mentioned"
1,very poor,"Loved it for a few days. After about 10 short usages (I only have a small patio to water), the thumb switch controlling water flow quit, and water could no longer be turned off. If it had lasted it would have been great. Now I'm trying the all metal Dramm nozzle."
3,Aweful shipping time,"Before placing the order, estimated shipping was only 3-5 business days. 7 business days later, still hasn't received this item, tracking is completely useless, complaint was ignored. As a result, could not rate the product. More than 90% of my order came in time, so overall it's pretty good, but Amazon could have combined some of the packages, there are too many of them!"
2,Didn't get what I ordered!,"I was happy to find a red watering nozzle so I ordered 2 of them. I also have a red garden hose and other red accessories. When I opened the box, it contained a purple one and a green one! I contacted them for a return request and after 2 emails, they still didn't give me one, but wanted to give me a partial credit instead, which is not what their return policy states. I finally gave in because I figured summer would be over before I actually received a red one. Then they told me there isn't even a choice of colors!! So why then do they offer a choice of colors in their listing, I asked. Oh well."
5,simply stunning,This book makes me love poetry. It is so loving and sad and precise. It is unparaphraseable. It is sweeping and minute at the same time. There is little more I can say except: get this book. You will love it.
5,As an alive album has the exactlly climax of an Albert King show,"Greate band, with the brothers Tony and Michaell Llorents on keyboards and drums, Gus Thorton on bass. Also piano , rythms guitar (may be Randall from Chicago) and Ed Early and his boys on horns. They open the set with a hot Chicken Shak.Rainin in California version alive is greate, but not complete.Anyway has the feeling and power of the pure sentimental blues of Albert's guitar and voice."
4,Heartfelt and honest,"Although I was a little taken aback by the style, these stories are a great read and certainly speak to the heart in a way that only a person from China would know. Highly recommended"
4,Interesting short stories,"This is an easy read. As someone else mentioned, you can read the short stories on the subway or in short breaks. The stories are simply written. If you are not familiar with Chinese culture, you may find them shocking. They give you a nice overview on the topic.The introduction of the book where the author is almost mugged and has her manuscript almost stolen is unbelievable. What author has only one copy of her hard earned work? This is not a big deal, but it created doubt in my mind about the truth of the other stories. This work is non-fiction supposedly. How much did the author exagerate? Of course, the mugging story could be completely true and in that case I apologize to the author for questioning her.For more in depth understanding of Chinese culture and society I recommend the following:Wild SwansChina WakesChina RoadFor outstanding fiction try Ha Jin books."
5,Not one you'll forget,"Xinran's telling of the stories of Chinese women make their lives very real, even for this far away country and culture that is far removed from our lives in the West. It is a haunting yet moving account that you will not soon forget."
4,Query about style,"I thought this a good and involving book, but I had a problem believing it - not because the stories themselves are incredible, but because the manner of telling them involves an excessive number of remarkable coincidences.This may be a tradition in Chinese literature that I am unaware of - a kind of 'tidying up' of events to enhance the balance of a true story - but the final effect was to make me a little doubtful.In particular, the coincidences relating to the author's father's former classmate stretched credulity, especially given the population and geographic scale of China.However, that said, the picture of women's lives is tragic and moving, and may increase understanding of 20th century China for a lot of Western readers."
2,Never received,This book was for a friend and I needed by a certain date. It never did make it to my house and there was not a tracking number to see what ever happened to it either. the sender did return my money he said but I have not checked my credit card bill yet to see if that actually happened. Very disappointed that this happened.
2,poor writing..,the stories are definately meant to shock the west and make money from it...there's no compassion in the compassionate attempt she makes in writing these..the writing is below standard.
3,"Depressing, Dated","I really wanted to like this book, but it was just too depressing. The stories are not so well written, but still were emotionally disturbing."
5,A good book,"This book is a real eye-opener to the treatment many Chinese women recieve from their husbands (and fathers).Xinran does a good job of telling the stories without letter her emotions surface and take over.I'd like to note: somebody else made it sound like these women are treated this way because China is communist, or because Chinese people aren't ""free"" (I would go into detail on what freedom really is, but that would take up too much space). It isn't the government but rather the men and the culture that are responsible for these women's hardships. In the US (and most other Western countries as well), rape does occur, sometimes often, as do spousal abuse, etc etc, but generally this isn't because the people of these countries aren't free. One may also note that none of these countries are communist, yet many of their women suffer."
3,wasn't what I'd expected,"It's not a badly written book, and it has some interesting insight, but it falls kind of dry and I never went back to finish it."
5,I really recommend this book.,"This book is for someone who wants to broaden their knowledge of women in China. In general, it can also broaden one's perspectives on life.The writing style is average, not too good, but not bad. The content is what makes it a good book. The true stories of these women can be overwhelming and will stay with you and affect the way you see the world. If you have a weak heart, this book might be too much for you, because it is really really sad. Overall, it is a book well worth reading."
4,Very Very Moving,"I've read a few books relating to China, some were romantic (The Joy Luck Club), some travelogues (Riding the Iron Rooster by Train Through China) and others brutal recounts of the country's tumultuous history (The Rape of Nanking). This book however, is the most poignant I have ever read.The stories are told in a way that makes the reader feel as though they are being spoken to directly. Some stories are so horrific and sad that I had to put the book down and come back to it later. There is so much suffering in the book but what stands out is that they,the women, prevailed. In a feeling of ""this too shall pass"" we see what the human spirit can endure and survive.If anything this book made me stronger. It's a must read.Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc."
3,Shipping is just as much as the product itself!,"Do not buy things like this from here - as above, shipping costs were relaly high and could have just been stuck in normal first class post for a fraction of the cost!!!"
2,Not As Advertised,"This is NOT a George Strait 15-song Volume three as shown above. It is a 6+6 Volume three. It only has 6 songs (6 performance and 6 vocals)- NOT 15 as shown above. I should have known something was wrong with it when I saw the price. I paid a fair price for what I got, but I'm disappointed that it wasn't a full CD+G.Here is the actual track list:1. I Just Want To Dance With You (Guide Vocals)2. King Of The Mountain (Guide Vocals)3. Meanwhile (Guide Vocals)4. Round About Way (Guide Vocals)5. One Night At A Time (Guide Vocals)6. Out Of The Blue Clear Sky (Guide Vocals)7. I Just Want To Dance With You (Performance Track)8. King Of The Mountain (Performance Track)9. Meanwhile (Performance Track)10. Round About Way (Performance Track)11. One Night At A Time (Performance Track)12. Out Of The Blue Clear Sky (Performance Track)"
3,Half Good,"Alison Moyet is best suited to the studio. The first CD is good, however the second ""Live"" CD in this collection is too much of a departure from her previously known work. The producer for the second Live CD should be shot & shot again. She clearly deserved better. Her talent is undisputed but it must be harnessed and not allowed to run wild. I look forward to her going back to her earlier commercial success with the YAZ sound. I wish her the best in her future."
4,this is a good gift item,Bought this for my father who enjoys playing chess but has no one to play with unless the grand kids come to visit. I thought this would be entertaining. He enjoys it alot. Great gift item
3,VitaKraft egg stick treats,"Until recently I have been buying the Vitakraft egg stick treats locally here in Hawaii, but for some unknown reason the local distributors stopped deliveries to the retailors and I now have to go on-line to purchase this product.The product is excellent my birds love them, they can't get enough of them. But because I am in Hawaii shipping costs are outrageous for the continental US 48 states shipping is sometimes free or at a moderate cost. but to ship to Hawaii costs as much as $25.00 to ship an item that only weighs a few ounces. I thank you for your very tasty product, but isn't there a less expensive way to ship.Thanks again"
3,an amazing story,"24/7 is a cool story and funny too. this story is unique because Dina is falling in love with her own stepbrother, which was pretty weird to among of us. but hey, love conquers everything and it can happen to anybody, and strictly, anybody even to your closest relatives."
4,Very Good. Kept me reading,"This book had a very interesting plot. I could really relate to the characters in this story. I couldn't put the book down because I was so exciting to find out what would happen next. I really enjoyed it and I hope to read more books in the LOVE STORIES series.Thank you for selling these nice books!Sincerely,Elyse, 12 yrs.old, GA"
3,This is a book to read 24/7,This is a nice book. It wasn't the best book of the Love Story Series but it was still good. I guess it just had to much un nessasary information that made it boring. It overall was blah. I hope not to influence you too much but it was quite boring. I prefer the more romantical books.
3,Get Real,"Don't get me wrong but this book was so unreal. Okay maybe if you enjoy books that make you feel in Lalalala land but i feel that i need to read a book that i can comapre my life to . No way will my ski instructor the one I love and have leave behind will become my step brother. Plus my Dad will not enjoy the fact that we will be living under the same roof. The book had some great points because they still had problems adjusting to each other. I would pick another book, even though the author writes good books."
5,Dingo Men's Harness Boot,"I had forgotten why I liked Dingo Harness boots so much. I probably haven't wore a pair since college or at least since I sold my motorcycle, and now I regret that. These are very comfortable boots, much more so than most military, cowboy, or work boots. The quality of the workmanship and materials are first class, and they have the proper height arch and heel. Shop around and you will see this is a great price as well, and twice the price for Frye is not worth the slight difference in quality and comfort. I have paid far more for less quality and comfort. Sometimes I have had problems wearing boots very long because they cause my back to hurt, but this is not the case with these Dingo boots. I highly recommend you get a pair if you need or like boots. Excellent for use if you are a motorcycle rider. Another plus is they are great for using with several costumes such as SciFi, Western, or Pirate.CA Luster"
3,Good boot but not perfect,"Well, I like this boot, but the insole is HORRIBLE! There is a small piece of black insole over the heel that after a short time slips away, and moves down the shoe. It is a big pain! Also the whole insole seems to be very cheap, and doesn't seem to hold. I had to buy a new insole in order to use the boot without hassles. You could try to glue the insole, but I tried, and still had problems, so it is best to just buy a new insole. Other then that I recommend buying a size a bit larger then what you wear for dress shoes. For example if you wear a size 12 in dress shoes you should get a size 13 for the boot. I made the mistake of getting a boot the same size as my dress shoe, and it does fit a bit tight. Also I would recommend that you also take a look at Chippewa boots. They are more expensive, but they are made in the U.S.A, and have a great reputation. Dingo boots are a good value, but for a little more you can get a better boot."
1,Not What I Ordered...,"I ordered The Dingo Dan Post's Mens Molly Harness Boot is ""Tan Apache Distressed."" What I received was the same boot in Mahagony.. Eeww. Anyway, I am shippong them back and getting them in Gaucho(?) because the ""Tan Apache Distressed"" version is no longer in production. Yet, it is still on the Amazon website and you can still order them. They will just ship you someting else..."
4,Comfortable and Inexpensive Boots,"I had a pair of Dingo boots growing up in the 70s and loved them then. I was happy to see Dingo was still around making fine boots. I am a 10.5 but ordered a size 10 (per other reviews and following the size chart). They are very comfortable and just look really great (I ordered the Mahogany). I was considering buying Frye boots (which I may eventually do), but for theses were less expensive. I am still breaking them in but they feel very good."
3,Dingo from Amazon,"These boots are rough on the inside and ""eat my socks"". They look good but I wish I had returned them rather than walking around in them. The sock issue is a real problem but I'm creative and I'll figure something out. If nothing else, it taught me how important the lining is."
3,A poor execution of a brilliant body of work.,"After receiving my copy of Complete Works today, I was very disappointed with the quality of its publication. It has a nice glossy cover, but the interior pages remind me of another publication: ValPack. The fact that many of the images are small and that they're printed on poor quality stock really diffuses the impact of Sorayama's work. Of course, this is still a ""must have"" for Sorayama fans because of the all-encompassing nature of the publication. Please note: Many of the pages should remain the exclusive domain of mature adults due to their highly erotic nature. Even most adults would probably be offended by a cherub urinating on an attractive woman or numerous images of bondage and torture. However, there are many other beautiful paintings of robotic women, turtles, fish and frogs. Let's face it, if you love Hajime Sorayama or if you just like big, chrome boobs this book's for you."
5,Erotic Art at its Best,"Wow, this book is a marvelous summary of all of Sorayama's work. Though a little small in this book, his work is revolutionary. Comparable to Olivia, his lifelike work is just superb. Be sure to check it out."
1,Keyless Entry Remote Fob Clicker for 2006 Honda Accord With Do-It-Yourself Programming,"The keys arrived promptly. I took them to a locksmith who ground them, then tested the keys in the ignition. The keys turned in the lock but would not start the car. The locksmith disassembled the keys to examine the microchip. The chip is not the correct model for the 2006 Honda. The locksmith gave me the correct chip number. I contacted the seller, DiscountKeyless. I informed them that the keys had the wrong chip and told them which chip I needed. DiscountKeyless told me that I would have to return the keys and would have to pay the difference in price between the incorrect keys and new keys. When told that the keys were already cut, Discount told me to contact a Honda dealer, tell them the VIN and get the correct FCC ID number for the keys. The person I spoke with was not interested in providing simple, useful help.DiscountKeyless has not provided either the correct items or reasonable customer service"
4,Wonderful music by the City of Prague Philharmonic,This is a great CD collection of James Horner's best film music. The selections demonstrate his depth of talent and diversity. CAUTION: The music this CD contains is performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic and NOT the original sound track recordings. You WILL notice some differences in arrangement and timing.
3,The days of great sounding cassette recordings are gone,"I bought this deck a week ago, exchanged it for another one, and my overall impression is that the quality of its recording capability is markedly inferior to my old Aiwa F770 deck, for which I cannot get replacement parts any longer. On the up side, this Denon deck plays my old tapes beautifuly, but its ability to record is markely inferior, with a noticeable degree of wow and flutter. For well recorded CD sources of string music like mandolins, the recordings it makes are barely listenable. For me the primarly utility of this Denon deck is to continue to have the ability to play old recordings, and to have a deck which seems well made and likely to last a while. CD and Flash memory recordings are so much better, that if I were you I'd think twice about buying any tape deck, unless you have a similar need to access old rare cassette recordings."
3,Just OK,"This provides some light at a low cost, but it often doesn't go out during the day so it has to be unplugged, plus when it does come back on it flickers for 30 minutes or so. I would not buy another."
5,Good Night light for stairs or hallway,"This is a excellent little light, the sensor is senstive and the LED is bright enough for waking up and going going to the bathrooms at night. However I did get this at a alot lower price then its currently is."
1,Poorly Built,"Bought for our 4 year old daughter. One of the table legs couldn't be attached securely due to the leg not being able to accommodate the screw needed to hold the leg in place. The others stayed loose. We tried using brackets to secure all of the legs, but they still came loose, bent inward, and basically rendered the table useless. This was reported to Amazon and they sent a whole new replacement free of charge. The second set, however, was no better and the same issue with the legs not fitting properly continued. Also, one of the slats from one of the chairs from each set came off. Would not recommend this set."
1,Warning- Sharp edges!!,The edges on the chairs are all sharp and not rounded off. My 18 month old scratched the back of her little legs all up the first time she used it. The back of the chair and all the edges on the actual seat are sharp as well. Not a good option for little ones. Returned it.
4,"Table good, BabyAge not so much","I bought this online thru BabyAge. The set itself is easy to assemble and the right size for a 2/3 year old, and sturdy. My table corner was damaged and BabyAge was useless in trying to get a replacement. I called Lipper International direct. They responded quickly and were very nice to deal with. I would not on the other hand, buy from BabyAge again. They are worthless."
3,"arrived damaged, but cute set","This set arrived broken, but I called and they sent a replacement (took much longer for them to ship replacement than original). Cute set of table and chairs."
2,"Very pretty, not functional","We bought this for our twins (2yrs old at the time) to go with a kidkraft kitchen set. The table and chairs are very cute, but the product is NOT durable at all. Within a few months the slats on the chairs began to move apart and pinch little thighs. It wasn't long before they came off completely (with staples sticking straight up in their place). My husband fixed them numerous times, before we stopped using them all together. After that, the legs on the chairs and the table wiggled apart, constantly having to be tightened until screws seemed to be stripped out. We then glued, and put in extra screws for stability. My girls aren't overly rough either, just sliding it gently across carpet, and they loosen the legs. Just a year later this table is literally barely standing. The kids also eat at this table, and from wiping it with a regular non scratch kitchen sponge after each meal, the table top has started to deteriorate. Very cute, but not worth the price AT ALL!!!"
2,Look nice but low quality,"We received the first package w/ massive damage and we had to returnThe second set arrived w/ few dents and scratches, below the bar to return but hard to consider this as high quality new set"
2,Damaged/not usable,"I ordered two tables, one had a whole corner of the table top gone and on the other one the chair didn't have a complete leg. It was hard to find a number to call to request a replacement. Cute color though."
2,Cracked legs,"This is a nice little set, perfect size chairs for my 2 yr. old. However, as I was assembling the table, I had two legs crack up at the top where they attach to the table. The wood seems very dry. Am awaiting two replacement legs, but it will be a while before my daughter has her entire set."
5,Great Christian Fiction,"This is one of Tracie Peterson's best series. She makes it exciting and draws you into the book, while also having some very good parts about God and faith. These books were the first of hers I read, and they remain my favorite.Karen, Grace, and Karen's aunt Doris are three of the most diverse characters I've seen in a book that remain fast friends. Grace is meek and shy; Karen is anxious for women to be seen as humans and have equal rights; Doris is an old spinster with a straight-forward view of life, believing in the education of women and children.The plot of the first book, Treasures of the North, caught my attention... and held it. I have to say I didn't expect the events in the second and third books, Ashes and Ice and Rivers of Gold. Tracie Peterson weaves words like a magician, something I strive to achieve. When I'm wanting for a book to read, the Yukon Quest is one of the first I consider."
5,Excellent followup to first book,"This book was great! I read it in two days (and nights)! The books includes other characters that develop before your eyes. Karen is awesome in this book. Karen's struggles are very real for most believers at certain times in thier lives. I certainly needed her testimony. I laughed and cried with the little group of friends and believers. Grace certainly stands up for God and herself and the results are going to be great. Of course, a cliffhanger is given in the end and I cannot wait for book 3!! Hurry up and get it published!!"
5,Better than the first!!,I loved this book! It was so much better than the first and I'm gald I stuck with the series. The love story between Karen and Adrik is wonderful. I enjoyed getting to know Jacob and Leah better and was happy to finally have Miranda developed into a character worth knowing. I highly recommend this book!
5,Great as expected.,"I bought this for the title track and also because I had the rest of his catalog. I found track #2 ""Simple Man"" to be a good surprise. ""I'm Not Who I Was"" received a lot of airtime, and is a great autobiographical track."
4,Enjoyable,"I purchased ""Don't Get Comfortable"" also after hearing ""I'm Not Who I Was"" on the radio. I don't regret purchasing the cd."
1,Not all that,"I wanted to write a good review for this, but the reality is - the album gets tiresome quickly, and there are only a few ""good"" songs - none of them catchy. I wish I had gotten it from the library or something instead of buying it. It's just gathering dust now. It doesn't mean I didn't like it - but, to be honest, lots of the songs were down write lame. The radio-release singles just aren't enough to carry the rest."
4,A Battle Not to Fight,"Brandon Heath's ""Don't Get Comfortable"" is a bubbly mix of positive music. Many tracks are overtly Christian. The opener ""Steady Now"" is one of the best tracks with catchy hooks and Brandon's boy-band friendly vocals, ""We don't have to wait until the end of the night just to say that something's wrong & maybe nobody's right; We're all victims in a battle we never had to fight."" The other shining star is the title track with its driving beat and Brandon's convincing vocals, ""You don't have to be afraid even if you make mistakes; You know that I'll remain."" Other tracks like the closer ""I Will Lay You Down"" & ""You Decide"" are also good. Most of this CD is excellent, well worth seeking out. Enjoy!"
5,Don't Get Too Comfortable,"Initially purchased this CD for one song, ""I'm Not Who I Was"", Track 7. Tracks 8 is delightful. Track 9 is such a vigorous praise and worship song, it will get you singing and praising! The entire CD was an unexpected surprise. Shared it with my boss and both she AND her 11 year-old daughter LOVE IT!"
5,Great Cookbook!,This cookbook has a fantastic variety of recipes. I keep going back to it for my favorites and to try new recipes. Everything I've made has turned out deliciously!
2,"Great for IE, horrible for Navigator","Robert Mudry's book should be renamed ""The DHTML Companion for IE"". He does an excellent job of describing DHTML for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but nearly excludes Netscape Navigator completely. That is fine if you are publishing web sites design strictly for IE, however in the real web designers have to accommodate as many browsers as possible. The scope of Mudry's book is too narrowly focused to be useful. Perhaps if he defined what was compatible with the different browsers certain portions of the book would be of use. Finding out that Mudry's scripts don't work in Netscape through errors and crashed browsers is not acceptable. O'Reilly's ""Dynamic HTML, the Definitive Reference"" is the way to go."
5,Perfect for the Learner,"I just got this bok for the Libary, and on looking through I was amazed. Its undoubtedly the best DHTML book I have ver seen. Simply written, assumes very little and quite thorough! Only problem is that much of it is now outdated (The specification has since evolved). So please Mr Mudry hurry up with new edition.If there was a 6 or 7 star rating I would still awárd it. I wish all books were written this way.- Olumide"
4,Great book for IE,"This book is excellent for studying IE based DHTML features although Netscape is barely covered, ignoring the title of this book. It thoroughly deals with essential concepts of Internet Explorer 4.0 based DHTML with step-by-step codes. However, it does not deal with its application. I mean, it was finished on the line of introduction of DHTML features. And it also does not give well-arranged tables which would contain the summary of each chapers for later quick reference. I felt that this book is very pleasant to read, and he *knows* how to explain hard concepts with easy to get words with humor. Great book for learning DHTML with IE."
2,OXFORD LARGE PRINT DICTIONARY,"While I appreciate the LARGE print in this dictionary, it comesat a SACRIFICE! There apparently are LESS entries than my oldpaperback Oxford American Dictionary. Accordingly I am dissapointed! :-("
1,SPARSE,"Too many words missing from this edition. I was very disappointed. Every time my kids tried to use it, we had less than a 50% chance of the word being listed. My one child needs large print, but not at the expense of hundreds or more of missing words."
3,As described,"This was ok, mostly ""gossipy"" stuff but good info. I'd suggest it if you want some inside gossip scoop...I got the digital version which was fine."
2,Unorganized,"This book was somewhat hard to follow. It was VERY unorganized. There were a few neat facts about Key West, but the book jumped around from one topic to another and was at times, sarcastic."
1,Key West Secrets Revealed...sort of,"Cute book, mildly amusing, worth the few minutes it takes to read. Does make me want to go back to Key West, but that's not too difficult."
2,DH: Gospel review,"I am a big fan of DH. I was very disappointed with his lastest effort. I felt the songs had no emotion and the harmonies, which I love him for, were not there."
3,It was ok...could've been better,"There were a few cuts on this album that I love, but then there were others that weren't. Dave seemed to be going through some things with this album which were evident in the quality of the album. It's like the first few songs were great, then he got to talking about his divorce and it went down hill..."
5,June Cottingham-SOUTHERN AUTHOR,"why isnt this woman on stand up!!!!June Cottinghams book, Homemade Once Upon A Times is too funny to even explain! This tells it all! Why doesnt more places carry her books?Please send me info on her.Harley Jacobsonhennafan@earthlink.com"
2,A let-down after Shady Grove...,"This is an enjoyable CD, but nothing phenomenal. The So What covers leave me saying, ""So What?""? This is nice to listen to late at night, but I thought Shady Grove was such a great CD that this was a real let-down. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I listen to this, but not that much. It just pales in comparison to other stuff."
5,An acoustic delight!,"I bought this album at a David Grisman concert in Austin on May 1, 1999. Grisman's quintet was in fine form, and it was one of the best live shows I've seen. This CD features the same group but with Jerry stepping in on guitar. These jazz standards sound great in this arrangement, mellow and energizing at the same time. Grisman's work is especially outstanding."
1,Diccionario de expresiones y términos de interés policial y criminalístico / Dictionary of terms and expressions of police and c,"Most of the terms included in this dictionary are common terms you could find in any dictionary. If you whittle down this dictionary to those terms that are relevant to what the tittle suggests, you would probably end up with and a few pages in your hand.It would have been beneficial to examine a few pages of the actual content before making the purchasing decision."
4,A solid and artistically substantial album.,"Hector was one of the 1990's best salsa romantica singers and this was among his best efforts. Although all songs are in the salsa romantica/erotica vein, Hector sings with true emotion and feeling (this sets him apart from most of his contemporaries) and can also improvise well. Check out the title track, ""Triste Dia"", ""Tu Regreso"", ""Yo Puedo, Tu Puedes"" and ""Asi Comenzo Nuestro Amor"" for confirmation."
3,A Corazón Abierto; Héctor Tricoche en su mejor tiempo como Solista,"Año 1992 - TH-Rodven - TH-2966Disco grabado con la excelente orquesta que acompañaba en el estudio a los cantantes salseros de la TH (El ""Team"" Ganador). Entre los músicos se destacan Juancito Torres QEPD (Trompeta), Papo Clemente (Congas) y Luis Quevedo (Piano). De Ingeniero de Sonido, el excelente Vinny Urrutia.Temas favoritos: Tu Regreso, Así Comenzó Nuestro Amor, A Corazón Abierto, Triste Día y el bolero Reloj."
4,"I'll Admit it, I Bought it for the Pictures!","But the text isn't bad either. This is a smaller sized book, only about 5 by 7 inches, slightly larger than standard paperback size. The author has written a modern personal Tao Te Ching. Uplifting brief paragraphs acompany vivid and colorful prints from China and Japan.This little volume offers an opportunity to take a short jaunt away from the usual humdrum. It's perfect for next to the computer (while waiting for things to download), waiting in line at the post office, or on top of the toilet tank (you need an explanation?)."
4,Temptin Fate,Francis Ray brings back Daniel Falcon from Only Hers but this time Daniel finds himself intrigued by someone he considers off limits. Daniel Falcon found out that fighting love was something that fate would not accept with his creep of the night yet honorable ways Daniel thought he would fall in love with two of his close friends' sister but Madelyn Taggert had some thing to say about it.Madelyn Taggert had been in awe with Daniel since first seeing a picture of him but never had she met him in real life until one unforgettable day in not the best condition did she literally run into him but after finding out who Daniel really was he didn't know what to do with herself.Daniel & Madelyn went through trial and tribulations to only finish their story of with a triumphant ending.
5,"DANIEL,DANIEL,DANIEL!!!!!!!!!!","When I first saw Daniel in ""Only Hers"" (Matt's story) I knew I wanted to know more about him. This story is fabulous! The Taggart-Falcon series of novels is out of this world. All romance fans should be required to read these books. But back to Daniel, he is a very compelling character. He's arrogant, stubborn and dead set against marriage, but he realizes his love for Addie in the end. A Great Story!"
5,Best Book I've ever read,I recommend this book to everyone who loves to read Romance novels. This book was so good that I have read it five times!! I am making a point to read everything that Francis Ray has written and will be writing.
3,Entertaining,"This is a story for true romantics. A good read but a little too fairytale-ish. Characters were not very beliveable. Very entertaining and I recommend it, but not as highly as some other romance novels that I have read."
1,"ohh my bad, did i fall asleep again????","what a boring book...i thought that this book was gonna be good after reading the reviews and when i got the book, it was VERY hard for me to finish..to me it was a drag and i was steady saying ""is this book over yet!!!???"" i wont be reading this book or anymore from this author again!!!"
2,HOGWASH!!!,"This book had a lot of potential. It started off very good butthe author was never able to convince me how Madalyn was able to zeroin and capture Daniel's heart. She spent a great deal building up Daniel's character as an uncommittal businessman, yet within a matter of moments he became every womans dream man, who is there every hour on the hour. I thought their love affair was unrealistic, there was no challenge and as I read on and on I felt myself saying that this is complete HOGWASH!! I realize that these books are romantic fantasies but you still have to have a believeable story, one strong enough to pull you in. This one did not!!!"
5,I too found this to be a marvelous book,"With its humble wit and universal wisdom, this is a treasure of a book. Full of numerous insights from Jung, Sophia and ""sacred geometry"", one can't help but feel more whole by the end of this book...and yet thirsting for more. Clearly Ms. Howell has found her path and we are all the more for her ability to share it.I recommend it to anyone on any kind of a spiritual path. It may not be THE answer, but it's a part of it."
1,Big Yawn,"This tedious, tiresome book offers nothing new. It just dilly-dallies along. Here's a point, here's a line, here's a triangle, here's a square, here's nothing worth presenting. Jung says, you say, he said, I said. . . My review is about as poorly crafted as the book. I expected something and got a pretty cover."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"The only reason I bought this movie, it had Raquel Welch in it. This had a very young Raquel in it and she look great. Outside of that this movie was bad. It was about a guy who thinks he saw a murder. He also thinks that Raquel saw the murder also and that's when the movie goes down hill and fast."
2,Just OK,"I was disappointed in this book. Reviews lead me to believe it was a well thought-out and well-presented approach to life philosophy. However, upon review, it is more of the same checklists that are presented in many other books. Did not find it to be anything special."
5,choosing happiness,"If this book and been titled as a self help book I might have passed it by, but the title intrigued me, every one of course would choose to be happy. As I started reading I thought I know this and was reluctant to continue, but something kept me going, the more I read the more it all made sense, yes I knew most of the things that were being said, but was I practicing them. It has certainly stopped some of my bad habits and put a different point of view forward to me. I will always keep it as a reference guide, and I have given one over to a family member, and told all my friends about it. It also helped me to heal some old wounds, and truly forgive things, that I thought had been unfairly done to me."
5,Forgotten Empress is a must for the serious ocean liner buff,"David Zeni has done a superb job in telling the sad story of the Empress of Ireland. His rich styleof writing kept me wanting to read the entire book with out stopping. He has dug out facts that earlier works on this forgotten steamer never touched, and he did it with extreme detail. If you like stories about the other lost liners of the turn of the century, this book should be on your list."
2,This is the weakest entery in the hightly success series.,"This movie has its moments of grandeur, but I found it to be very lame and a real dissappointment (althoughI did like the part where John Luke goes inside that space time continuim and sees his family). The one after this movie ""Star Treck First Contact"" I think is a much better movie, with better special effects than any of the other ones (including the ones with William Shatner)."
4,Id reccommend....,"I am normally not a reader of this type of book but Mr Pearce is a long time friend of the family (no, he did not pay me to write this) So I decided to check it out. I have not even read or seen Cool Hand Luke either.It took a little getting used to Mr. Pearce's style of writing but once I did I found myself truly engaged in the story of Toby Parker.Altho I dont think most females on the whole would like (or appreciate) this book, if you are a lover of historical war stories this might be your cup of tea. Like I said earlier Im not a reader of this type of book but I ended up enjoying it.I would highly reccommend it for a fathers day gift or for a good read in general."
4,A pleasant return to some old stomping grounds,"I really wanted to gush about how great and fantastic this was, and all that jazz.But, I can't.I can gush about how it was a great story, well done, though the art was a little too pretty at times - I preferred Truman's less polished stuff on the original series, years ago... but hey. The covers are phenomenal, and the majority of the interior art is balls-on. It's great, but...The story is a prelude - it takes place before any of the other stories we've seen to date (except for flashback stories, of course.) This introduces John to us, takes him from being a TDP cop to a member of the Cadre, and even has his first ever visit to Munden's.It's got most of the major characters, somewhere, somehow. It's an excellent story, and it's fun, and that's all that matters."
3,Had to have,"I used this workbook/study guide along with Potter and Perry: Fundamentals of Nursing, 6th edition. I wasn't crazy about this study guide, but it was required for my 1st semester of nursing. It is a detailed study guide."
1,Not helpful at all,"This study guide is the worst, some of the chapters don't match with the book, and there are very few quizzes, it just wants you to write the textbook over again in the guide."
1,Save your money students,"I bought this along with the hardback text (which I love) and find it next to useless. It's set up to coincide with the text, so you go to the chapter you've read, and it just has you fill in the blank sentences right out of the text. If you're into rote learning where you write or say something over and over, maybe you'll like it. I was hoping for something that would add to the book and help achieve greater understanding, or at least challenge me. Also, some of the parts are out of line with the chapter, like they must have updated one of the texts and not the other. The chapter review questions in the hardback text are MUCH more helpful, as is the website that goes along."
2,Useless,This study guide is useless. Just use the notes that you should be taking in class. This book is only good if your teacher has a hard to understand accent and the book is confusing to you.
4,Fundamentals of Nursing,"While it didn't come with the CD school wants us to have, it was $60 cheaper! For that, I can borrow or have someone burn me a CD (I am familiar with hospital nursing so don't need the CD anyhow)."
3,Average Textbook,"The overall content of the textbook is generally well laid out, it is the explanation that of the content that is lacking in substance. The first 8 chapters are well written and interesting in concept; it is the latter portion of the book that lacks in substance. Too many statistics that seemed to draw very little conclusion regarding church service attendance greatly detracted from the subject of religiosity. the information is adequate for the subject, but was not the most compelling information."
1,"Another unreliable ""reference""","My hobby being nautical history for about twenty years now, I eagerly bought this book hoping it to be a gem. However, to my dismay, the first (and only) time I looked for a subject in it, I found it to be rubbish.Reading under the subject ""caravel"": - the old northern confusion between ""caravela"" and carvel-built ship lurks (they are not equivalent, although the latter definition includes the former) - the ""round"" caravel is called ""caravela rotunda"" (in portuguese: ""fat caravel""!) instead of its real name of ""caravela redonda"" or ""caravela de armada"" - the (very well documented) four mast ""round"" caravel is described as having three masts: two forward masts with square rig and a lateen mizen!!! Does it mean every three mast square-rigged ship is a caravel? - The ""nau"" (carrack) ""Santa Maria"" is called a caravel!!! - The ""naus"" of Magalhaes are also called caravels!!!If it wasn't a serious issue, it would be rather comical!"
4,Poignant Memories of a True Poet,"Put this CD on, pour a glass of red wine, find a place to sit in the warmth of the sun or the cool of the shade, and listen to Kate Wolf's evocative lyrics lovingly rendered by some of acoustic music's best."
4,A GOOD ONE FOR MEL B!,"This album is just as the title suggest ""HOT""! This is a good beginning for Melanie B. I think this is a very creative album. The best songs are ""Feels So Good"", ""Tell Me"", ""Hotter"", and""ABC123"". I give Mel much props for this one and I expect much more!"
5,Awesome Baseball,"I think The Game I'll Never Forget was one of the finest, most informative books I've ever read. Each story captures the essence of the man and the game. Mr. Vass is a wonderful writer and I've enjoyed his ""The Game I'll Never Forget"" stories for years. What a wonderful idea to compile them into one great book. I'd love to see another 50 stories compiled for my reading pleasure."
4,awesome candy mold,This christmas tree candy mold is awesome.The product was just as described and fast shipping. I make a lot of candy and this mold is easy for anyone and any age. Will def order from this supplier again.
1,Bible?? The book is less then a inch thick!,"Maybe its the beginners bible and not the holy bible size they were talking about. This book is for beginners only!! The main part of this book is recipes. If I wanted that I would have bought a recipe book not a book to teach me about diabetes nutrition. This is not a complete anything!!! Try Prevention The Sugar Solution. I am returning the ""bible"". What a waste of my money having to return this book. Not sure why it has so many stars."
3,Eh.,Don't stop the Rock and Heart go boom are the only really good titles on their CD. The rest of the CD becomes monotonous and boring.
4,the Mithy is back,"This single show with who the Chemical Brothers, the Prodgy, Power and others big beat bands learn how to make music... Is better than many techno pop played by radio stations, but, it's still rock!"
5,"A Wonderful, Wonderful Story",I have not read Embers of The Heart yet. This book has taught me about history as well as provided an exciting story. I like the fact that there is little sex in her books thus far and very few curse words.I highly recommend this as a book to pick up to read for enjoyment.
4,Good Jams,"I dig Freddie Jackson's 80's Jams especially ""You are My Lady"",""Rock me tonight"".His Voice just flows with the Grooves on His Best Material.He made some cool Laid-Back Jams back in the day."
4,Very Good Set,"back in the day Freddie Jackson had some cool Slow Jams out.""You are My Lady"" Rock Me Tonight for old times sake were the cuts.I got this set in another Greatest Hits package but I still enjoy it.good Production&His Vocals worked really together here."
4,Very Entertaining,"I purchased this video based on its description without first watching it online. While it started off different than most that I normally watch, I found it entertaining enough that I actually had to stay up very late to watch it all the way thru.The 24 episodes cover the story very well. It is organized in mostly chronological order, although story background is covered in several sections by having entire episodes dedicated to fully covering the background stories of various characters.The focus of the story is a basic struggle against oppression with a very healthy dose of fan service included. Lots of magical powers, panty shots and humor mixed together well. Not recommended for kids."
1,Not durable!,"I bought this in Jan 2006, by Jan 2008 my warranty has now expired and the unit doesn't work at all, the platter has a mind of its own. It will spin fast, then slow down. This sounds SO incredibly horrible I cannot believe it. I would not bother with this turntable at all. Go somewhere else -- anywhere else!"
1,disappointment,"I got this product as a gift and had to return it 2 times before I got one that worked. It does not have anti-skate or counter weights and the button operated ""start/stop"" playback is annoying and usually doesn't work. The stylus is alright.Best feature: built in preampWorst feature: no weights, auto return will move the stylus back to resting position for no reasonSave your money and buy a high-end, direct-drive player. You will be much more satisfied. I do not advise this product even for the casul listener."
2,denon dp29 J LP player,Yup it was all good till it started playing lp fast?not impressed!! This is the second time it done this too.
2,Does the Job Barely,I have seen this turntable marketed under three brands so far. I picked one up under the Optimus (Radio Shack) line so my wife could play her somewhat thrashed records. I picked it up on clearance for 39.95 about seven years ago. At that price it did the job but I would not let it touch a quality Lp or it will be damaged upon being played. I am surprised Denon would put there name on this turntable it's a good way to lessen there reputation. The one difference between this one and mine is the platter on mine is plastic and this one is alloy. Other than that they are identical. If you have records in not so great shape and do not play often then this rig is ok even if a bit pricey for what you get.
1,Junk,"This turntable is about as sturdy as a piece of plastic - err, well, that's because it IS a piece of plastic. Not recommended."
4,mustache wax,"It is what it is. The product was as advertised. The whole waxing the mustache thing proved more involved than I thought, but that's not the fault of the product."
1,lots of silicone,this is weak. average looking women with fake everything taking off a few of their clothes and moving around...a little. that's it.
4,Good examples of Munch's concert performances,"First off, most of these performances should not be considered first choices for your library. That being said, however, they are exciting and in some cases, wonderful live examples of Munch's conducting, particularly the Debussy set with Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer performing the solo piano part in the Fantaisie. The Honegger works, most of them the only ones available under Munch's baton are truly great. The 1st Symphony's coda is really magical. The Pastorale d'ete is beautiful as is Honegger's final symphonic statement, Di-Tre-Re. If you enjoy Munch's conducting, you should get this set."
4,El Mesquite - A Mesquite Tree's View of History,"El Mesquite is a novel on the history of Nueces County, Texas from the time of Spanish Landgrants to the early 1900's. The author, Elena Zamora O'Shea, writes the novel from the viewpoint of a mesquite tree. The tree, ""Posta del Palo Alto"", is a marker on one of the old Spanish trails common in Texas. The story details the settlement of the area around the tree, working its way from the earliest settlement of the area to around 1905.Being a native of this area of Texas and being intimately knowledgeable of Nueces County, it was a fascinating story for me.I suggest that you read the novel first, then read the introduction. Leticia M. Garza-Falcon writes a very interesting, but very long winded introduction to the novel that essentially tells the whole story, leaving little for the reader to discover in the novel.I recommend it for anyone that has an interest in South Texas history, or Hispanic based novels."
4,Lovely tale about the area between the two rivers,"A beautiful tale recounting the history of an area inTexas which has long been overlooked. Mrs. O'Shea, a native of the area,shares her sympathy and love for the land with the reader.A great book to help young people (and old) understand events in Texas history."
4,"Good book, but it ends before the story is over.","This book really gives the average reader a good idea of what SEAL training is all about. However, this book ends at hell week, and does not finish the story about the rest of the specialized training. I was really encouraged to read that SEAL training has not been softened up. It is no wonder they are still an elite fighting unit."
4,Less then I expected,It was a good book with lots of info about first phase. But I wish there was second and third phase into there to.
4,Great read...until the end,"This was a fantastic read all the way up through Hell Week. Immediately after the trainees complete Hell Week, you can stop reading, as the remaining portion of the book is worthless. As many other reviewers have already stated, the descriptions of the daily activities up to, and including, Hell Week read almost like a personal diary of a SEAL trainee. However, the storyline that is attempted is pathetic - a recruit trying to investigate an active duty SEAL...uh, hello, these guys are trained to operate invisibly and blend in, so the likelihood a recruit would be able to turn up anything on an instructor would be close to nil. Still highly recommended reading...through the completion of Hell Week."
5,Review of Suffer in Silence,"I didn't realize until after I received the book that it was fiction. That was a disappointment at first, and then I started reading it. I finished the book in two evenings. Whether or not the author ever became a SEAL or not is irrelevent. His story telling was excellent and it was obvious that the author either experienced BUDS first-hand or heavily researched his material with men who had. The book was thoroughly enjoyable and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys military books."
4,A great read,Wow! I picked up this book on a suggestion from a friend and spent whole weekend reading it. I really felt the emotions of the main character as he went through his training. The author creates a vivid and realisitc portrait of a man pushing himself beyond evry limit. I highly reccomend this book.
3,Great Start,"I enjoyed this book until the point that Hell Week ended b/c up until that point the book read like non-fiction and I really felt that the reader could understand somewhat, the phenomenal insanity these recruits subject themselves to. After Hell Week however, the fiction became unbearably ridiculous!!! Show me a recruit that's #1 able to conduct an investigation of a SEAL Instructor and #2 conduct it right after Hell Week ends and I'll sell you a bridge."
4,"Good read, but how accurate?","Although I've read a lot of books (both fiction and non-fiction) on Navy SEALS, their training, etc. - ""Suffer in Silence"" sort of brought it to a new level. I get that BUD/S trainees get abused both verbally and physically, yet I guess I never thought it went to this level. Since it's written by David Reid, a man who tried out but didn't make it through BUD/S, I'm sure a lot was based on reality. But how much?"
3,The ending leaves something to be desired.,"This book was a great read until the last quarter of the book. It was a very half hearted wrap up to an unconvincing conflict. It was like the author couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a memoir of his experience or a fiction novel. Like a previous reviewer said, it was actually hard to tell that it was fiction until the last few chapters (which is a bad thing in this situation). And then resolution was just a big misunderstanding and we all have a mutual respect for one another now."
2,"Too ""fictious"" for a real Seal fan.","As someone who has read every Navy Seal book written - a ""novel"" just isn't fair to the brotherhood. Let's just stick to the facts."
3,"Pretty good, but....","I really enjoyed this book. However, it wasn't until I finished the book that I realized that it was fiction. It was still very good and makes one appreciate the mental and physical anguish that anyone attempting to reach the goal of becoming a Navy Seal has to endure. Just imagine being covered in sand and cold for days on end without having any sleep. 65 degree weather and 51 degree water would not be fun. Anyway, an entertaining read even though it is fiction."
3,Grey's Anatomy,The book was well written. I would have liked it if the author had written it from an autobiographical point of view. The main character's name is Grey. He was dull and one dimensional. Author could have chosen a more colorful Seal to follow.
5,Cleverly Written and Insightful,"The author has an uncanny way of seeing the world from the point of view of man's best friend. This book could be a challenge for some youngsters, but that will not diminish their enjoyment."
5,a great tribute to Mario Lanza,"This book, ""Be My Love,"" is a great and poignantly written biography on Mr. Lanza's life. Telling about his happy and sad times. He was truly a gifted and loving man. The photos ar egreat and this is indeed the best biography I read on him. I very highly reocmmend it."
3,Wanted More,"I enjoyed the book, because I am an avid Mario fan. However, I finished with a very hungry feeling: I wanted more. More analysis of Lanza recordings (the short essay was great but, well, short). More specifics on the rumors and gossip that were constantly jeered at in the book; I had no better grasp on what was true or false than when I started. More personal reminiscences, like what his co-stars felt. The tidbits from Vincent Price, Niven, Barrymore, etc. were great, but I want to know more of what they thought. How about a sequel?"
4,Decent product for the money,"The power leads supplied are short, and the location for connecting them to the inverter is too low to allow the terminals to clear a shelf or any flat surface, so the unit must hang over an edge or the terminals bent, or turned sideways."
3,Somewhat satisfied,The product worked pretty good. It just couldn't keep up with the refrigerator on the car battery. Probably refrigerator is too big.
1,not happy,"Purchase this inverter for my rv, within two days the led screen stopped working , only shows part of the voltage numbers. The cables that came with the unit are to large for a standard 12 volt plug. Going to try and return the unit."
5,Fun realistic train,"I surprised my husband with this set for Christmas (yes boys never outgrow toys!). I spent a while researching different sizes and brands and customer reviews and decided to go with this train for it's traditional set of cars and realistic extra features, like all of the sounds it makes (horn, whistle, chugging, crew sounds, brakes), the light that works and the smoke which is so cute how it puffs out in little circles. It has been working fine, no probs (though note: to turn crew sounds on there is a switch on the bottom of one of the cars, took us a while to find that), and should be fun for years (and future children) to come."
4,"an all rounded book, from the conceptual to the practical","This is an all rounded book, from the conceptual to the hands-on practical level. It can ne used as a text book, cook book or ""creating ideas"" book with appeal to the student, to the neophyte as well as the seasoned project manager.I found the material well distributed and balanced ; epecially liked the concept of IPDM (iterative project development methodology) and the chapter on outsourcing; the survey results give it more authenticity.The Microsoft chapters and the templates are also very useful.I would have liked the templates to be more unified, perhaps tying back with the concepts of phase/activity/task.Highly recommended as a very good book on project management."
2,Slight difference from the 1st edition,Please note that the significant difference is the replacement of the MS Project 4 with a new version. It would have been a more useful reference book if the 2nd edition had included some new topics on managing the internet or e-commerce projects.
4,Very good book for people ready to use project management,"I found the book very useful. It contains many lists, examples, and templates that are directly relevant to software project management. It is very focused on the subject. Also found useful chapters that discussed common causes of success and failure, with case studies. Downside is that I found it a difficult book to actually sit down and read. Quite a few chapters were mostly reading outlines and lists. Although the web site was unavailable (11/8), the editor quickly (<24 hours) emailed the templates. Impressive customer service!!"
3,Difference from the 1st edition,"I have read the 1st Edition few years ago. That book is very good for people who are interested in managing software project. I bought the new version in Christmas. It will be most grateful if someone can list out the essential difference between the 1st edition and the new edition, besides the replacement of the Microsoft Project (old version) with the 2000 version so that I can jump directly to the new topic in the book isntead of reading it from A to Z."
5,A must have for practicing PMs,A great reference book for all practicing PMs. You can pick up some excellent tips on managing software development projects.
1,I recommend,"You not purchase this item. It was a complete disappointment, and unusable. Took longer to order, ship and try several times, than throw it into the trash."
1,Too dry to buy,"Could not find any way to use this product. Tried to follow directions to thicken flat sectioned panels, but found them ineffectual. There was no grain on the panels' surface to allow the outer plastic filament to be peeled away in order for the chemical mixture inside to expand."
1,Leaked after two months,"Thought it was the greatest product ever! But after two months of infrequent use it is leaking gel/fluid. I've been using it to keep my water in my camelbak cold, so it's placed beside my hydration pack reservior to keep it cold from outside. So I know for a fact nothing sharp punctured it, otherwise my hydration pack would also be punctured. It also doesnt stay cold for days, maybe half a day or so. Great concept poor product."
3,Sizes are smaller,"I had two of these berets and they were my favorite hats. I lost one when the airlines lost my luggage. I ordered a replacement in the same size, but it was too small. For some reason, the sizing is now smaller than a couple of years ago. This was confirmed by both the retailer and the manufacturer. (As I need an extra large and that is the largest size, I'm down to one beret.)"
2,sizing off,"I have this same hat in camel & like it so much I decided to find it it in black. I was delighted to find one on line. It was shipped quickly and packaged carefully, but the hat was a disappointment. I ordered a size M and this clearly was not the same M as the camel hat. Also the inner band (grosgrain ribbon) was so stiff, it was uncomfortable. It didn't seem to be of the same high quality of the other hat I have. I returned the hat. I do want to acknowledge that I was quickly refunded for my return."
4,short stories,A very good way to get a look at the civil war through short stories. Should be mandatory reading in every high school in the nation.
4,Light up my Life,"I purchased this book many years ago when I was desperate to understand how to best use my digital camera, in-doors and take pictures of products that I sold.This book was a beginning in understanding of lighting. From the book I was able to produce better pictures, but I still needed a better understanding of bulbs, fixtures and background. Once I meet a professional photographer I instantly understood because I ate this book over and over. I was able to ask all kinds of intelligent questions.Being in a real studio made me understand the limitations and frustrations I was having trying to produce a produce with a white background. Buy this book to understand. Don't think that this will help you bring you to a professional status. I am still looking for that book."
1,"Ponti, Wild are better","I looked forward to fresh recordings of the fantastic Moszkowski concerto and the wonderful Paderewski concerto. Piers Lane is an excellent pianist whose recording of the Scriabin preludes is highly highly recommended. It is a gem of a recording. I can't really say that for his recording of these concertos. In and of themselves they are fine performances, but once you have heard Michael Ponti's Moszkowski on Vox and Earl Wild's Paderewski on Elan, there is no comparison whatsoever. In light of Ponti and Wild, Lane lacks luster, vitality, and the powerful moving delivery of the Ponti and Wild recordings. The orchestra in the Lane recording is likewise less than satisfactory. Get Ponti and Wild."
1,"Bad card, worse support","I got one of this cards and did't work at all. Try calling coustumer service. The worse I have ever seen. They don't return the phone calls or e-mails. What is worse, after running the test included with the drivers my 32 bit files got corrupted and have to reinstall WIN 98se. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY PRODUCTS."
1,Does not work with 98SE,"After reading these reviews, I decided to purchase this card. This card does not work with windows 98SE. After a weekend of trying to get this card to work, I returned it and purchased a Belkin. I had the Belkin operational in less than an hour.If you have an older operating system, do NOT buy this card!!!"
1,Warning - They never send this product!!,"I ordered this product 1 month back, but haven't received it yet! And they say it won't be shipped for another 2-3 weeks! The whole mail-in-rebate is a fiasco to trap poor customer, because you will never receive the product before the mail-in-rebate offer expires!!!"
5,"Inexpensive network card, clear manual, and it works !!","Our review title just about says it all -- for very little money, and merely opening up the PC tower and popping this in, we were connected to the network in no time with no trouble. The manual was clear and correct (amazing!). We can see why Linksys has a good reputation -- we are completely satisfied !"
4,Great card... ?,"I had a CNet network card before and got terrible network performance. Then I decided to switch to these linksys cards, and they worked like a charm. Coupled with the linksys 5 port workgroup switch home networking is a breeze.So why did I give it 4 stars? I wanted to use the Wake-On-Lan feature of the card, since my old CNet had it. But when I got the new linksys card, the WOL was only through a feature called PME (Power Management Event), whereas the CNet (and other cards) provide a WOL cable that connects to the motherboard. The linksys card did not provide for this cable.Also, the card is version 5.1 but keeps appearing as version 4 in Windows XP."
5,Doesn't crash my computer,"For 7 months I was using USB to connect my cable modem to my computer and at least 3 times a day my computer would crash. Well, finally, after so many months later, Microsoft's crash analysis error report eventually figured out it was the USB driver for the cable modem. So, I called my cable ISP and they suggested I use the Ethernet connection. I looked around and found the Linksys LNE100TX ver 5.1 at a great price, after all the rebates, and picked one up. I have to say I'm glad I did. Now, I don't use it for networking it is just to connect my computer to my cable modem. It simply works beautifully and my computer hasn't crashed for weeks. You're getting a great product at a nearly nothing price."
5,Up and Running in Less than 30 Minutes,"We plugged it in, powered it up, loaded the drivers, and it worked. Absolutely no hassles. My nine year old son helped me install the card. The majority of the time required to install the card was consumed by unplugging all the cables from the computer, opening the case, vacuuming out the dust (a little preventative maintenance can't hurt), closing the case, and reconnecting all the cables."
2,"OK, but installation confusing","I have installed two of these, and each time the installation instructions failed but for different reasons. I had to play around a fair amount to find the files that the installation program needed, either already on my hard disk, on the Windows installation CD or on the diskette that came with the card.Even on the diskette, the installer was unable to find the required files until I figured out where they were on the disk and told it. I find it astounding that they can't get their own installation program to find their own files."
1,High defective rate and poor customer support,1 out of 5 defective unit. I also purchased 24-port hub with 2 bad ports and emailed or called Linksys customer support. They never respond. You can only wish that nothing goes wrong with your purchase!! How about thumb down rating with Linksys!
4,B+,"I did not have problems to install or run the card. As for speed, it's exactly same as 3Com's expensive one in my notebook. A 22MB file can be tranferred in less than 9 seconds. Hope this also works for linux(I haven't tried it). ... I gave it 4 stars because i found the cable cannot fit nicely to the card."
1,Worthless... period,"Easy installation.... I think not. I tried to install this card on my WinME machine... everything was going fine until it said it needed an extra file. I found it, it said it installed. I'm rebooting my comp, when it freezes on the Windows Logo. I cut the power after about 10 mins of sitting there, then reboot. The comp loads, I goto Device Manager, and see that my Linksys card has a fatal error, oh joy. I uninstall, then try reinstalling the drivers, I point the way to that extra file it says it needs. Again, my computer froze, in the middle of installing. To make a long story short... I had to revert my system back to before I had ever tried to install this. Be warned!"
1,"??? No Macs ???? too Bad, Products are good ...","The Linksys products I've purchased in the past are good, and even the compnay policy / warrenty ( spelling ??? ) is strong. I know, folk's may say, "" Well, this guy's got Macs, too bad for him."" We are all entitled to our own humble opinion ...But, No Drivers are available for the Mac Product line. No OS X.No 9.x's . No 8.x's.I realize that the only people who get the decission to buy the Macs are not the ""accounting"" dept. or DP ... Just us small business owners with 10 - 20 networked computers ... But, this isn't about Macs vs. Win boxes; it's about missed opportunity by Linksys to support a customer base. I mean, really, without the hardcore out there, would there even be any support for Lynix?"
4,Only ONE annoying thing,"At the end of the installation (which took me an entire 7 minutes) I sat down to fill in the warranty card which asks for the serial number which is ONLY printed on the unit itself. That was VERY annoying.But otherwise the instructions were clear, the installation a SNAP (i mean, my 72 year old mother could have done it, and she's still nervous about the VCR!)the software set up was easy and the performance has been great.<P..."
2,unreliable,"Linksys shipped several very different versions under the same name: LNE100TX. The version 2.0 was good (with 4 indicators), versions 4.0 and 4.1 (with 2 indicators) are unreliable. One v4.0 card of mine has a problem with throughput, which drops down to 100KB/s under stress."
1,Spend a few extra bucks,"I work technical support for a DSL Internet service Provider. The *only* manufacturer of Ethernet cards that we consistently have a problem with is Linksys. Avoid them. Their router seems to be okay, but the cards are terrible."
1,Expect shoddy hardware,"When I first came to college I ended up helping a number of people connect to the residential network. Of everyone I know only three people weren't able to get online, and all three had bought a Linksys LNE100TX. The model seems to be prone to failure, and behaves sporadically even at the best of times. I've spent hours installing and reinstalling drivers for this card. Even if it does work, it's just not worth the bother of installing it. If you're looking for a good, cheap ethernet NIC, go with D-Link."
4,A Good Card For The Price,"First, I don't know what everyone is talking about Linksys's service and support, I have called twice in the past 3 days and got someone on the phone in less than 15 min. This is by far the least amount of time I have ever been on hold with a company about a problem with one of their product.Second, I agree with some that have said the card doesn't always work. My card stopped responding. I haven't a clue why but with the 2nd call I have a replacement coming.I am very satisfied with the performance of the card. I have no problem highly recommending this card to anyone. Easy to install and setup."
3,Doesn't work for Win2K,"I bought 2 Linksys LNE100TX cards and one 5 port HUB. The connection is very simple and it works in the first 5 minutes on my Windows 2000 PC. My Windows NT 4.0 PC still can connect to other Win NT PC, but the Win2K PC lost the connection. I can get another 4-5 minutes connection back if I reboot the Win2K PC, but this is not it suppose to work. I download the latest driver from the Web, but still couldn't fix this problem."
1,Stuttering and collision prone,"I have four identical computers at the office connected through a 10-T HP High end hub. I have been using NIC cards for 5 years. This card is slow, and locks the mouse up, and 'dissapears' from the hub link. The computers are PIII 700's w/128M. I took it out, and replaced it with a Netgear and worked perfectly. To see if it was the Linksys, I tested different hubs, and the Linksys card in the other computers; same problem. It's a horrible card or drivers! ie. The stuttering makes it impossible to play LAN lunch games!"
1,Not compatible with Win98?,"I bought and installed this card with (relatively) little hassle. I'd never even opened up my computer before, but the card plugged in easily and I was feeling pretty cocky. When I started up my machine, I had to walk through the ""new hardware"" installation wizard *three* times before the card was properly recognized (probably not the card's fault... ). Then the real problems began. I chatted with no fewer than five tech support people at my ISP because although my DSL was up and running, neither Netscape nor IE5 was able to find the network. Finally, one guy thought to ask which brand of ethernet card I had. When I said Linksys, he said, ""Oh, no."" Turns out they've had at least three other people who couldn't get these cards to function properly with Win98. I don't know who to hate more--Linksys or Microsoft.By the way, my ISP guy recommended Netgear or 3Comm as the best ethernet cards to buy."
2,Doesn't work well with Netgear 10/100 switch,"I really liked this card until I bought a Netgear FS108 10/100 switch. No matter how I configured the LNE100TX card, it would only talk to the switch if I forced it to 10mbps mode. Forcing to 100Mbps wouldn't work, nor would autonegotiation.If I wanted a 10Mbps card, I would have gotten one. This is a poor performer."
4,Easy of installation on multiple os's at a good price,"This particular linksys card is a total breeze to install on *BSD, Linux and Windows boxes. Considering the price, its a good deal for a 10/100 FD card. Performance is not the greatest, but for a small home network, I'd say its hard to beat the price for what you get."
2,Does NOT work with certain POGO games,I had no problems with this until I became a POGO.com player. The games from EA sports sponsored by Pogo have compatibility issues. The pogo website says 3-com and D-link cards do not have these issues. Wish I knew that when I bought it.Dan
2,Hit or miss in Windows ME with Revision 4,"I'd give this card a 5/5 stars if Linksys stayed with Revision 2 of the card, but they changed it to Revision 4. This causes all sorts of trouble and you use windows default drivers. I don't even know what this thing does in 98. It's a shame that this had to happen, but I think I'm going to go with netgear now."
2,"Quirky Drivers, poor Linux support","I bought this card with the idea of using it with Linux (Mandrake 7.x) because Linksys had drivers and support page for Linux installation. I finally gave up just short of re-compiling the kernal (network card should not be *that* difficult to support). After spending serveral days search the net for updated drivers and newgroup info on the card, I decided it wasn't worth the effort and I put my Intel 21040 chipset card back in (which now works with the latest dist of Mandrake). Windows install was odd, but finally worked after tweeking the BIOS settings."
1,Win 2000 Driver Problem,Does not work for WIN2000. The WIN 2000 drivers are not ont he CD and everyone I downloaded did not work.
1,Cheap and unreliable,"I recently purchased two LNE100TX NICs...after just three months, one of the NICs is no longer functioning. Spend a little extra money and get a reliable NIC of decent quality."
1,same happend to me - wish I had read this,"I bought 2 of these cards and the router/hub. Router/hub worked fine, both cards had problems with my pc's. I went to the store and bought $5 cheapies and they worked fine. So much for buying everyhting from the same manufacturer.The best was when support finally called they would't help because I did not have their nic cards INSTALLED, even though I had them in the corner collecting dust. nasty supprt. Ouch."
2,"Works, but an annoying lack of lipsync","The picture is fine, the remote works, and Windows software it supplies is reasonably easy to use (I didn't test the FM radio functionality). The main flaw with the supplied software is the lack of audio/video synchronization -- video plays out about a half second before the corresponding audio plays -- which makes watching news or scenes with people talking on screen annoying."
4,Good set of dvds,"Some excellent techniques shown he does not show all his best techniques, its good if you have other instructions to which you can add this stuff."
3,adequate as a review resource,Having all four CCNP topics in one book seems like a good idea. It only works as a review resource though. If you don't already know the material this is not the book for you. It doesn't go into enough detail on enough topics to cover everything that you need to know for the exams. It is a good resource to review before you take the exam.
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book for my CCNP recertification. I ran into a bunch of stuff on the exam that was not covered in this book or was in greater detail than was covered by this book. I used Sybex books before on my original CCNP certification and I passed. If I try to recertify, it won't be with one of those books. I'll use Cisco Press. Live and learn."
3,Old book,With the new format for the CCNP tests i would advise getting a newer book. Although you will find very usefull information in this book the new tests require updated information that just isnt located in this book.so over all its a good book but not so good for studying for the CCNP tests.
2,CCNP CD Missing,"Hello,I received CCNP Book but it has misssing in CD in it.Please can you send me the CD for CCNP book. with out CD I have short to study this book.reply me as soon as possible."
3,Of limited usefulness,"I purchased this book because I was interested in how a consultant should go about reforming a bureaucratic organization (i.e., from the inside). What the book discusses, however, is dealing with bureacratic organizations from the outside (e.g., as a frustrated consumer). So if you want to know how to deal with rude airline personnel or college administrators, you'll find the book useful. On the other hand, if you're trying to reform a bureaucratic organization from the inside, it will be of little use.As is pointed out in another review, many of the examples are either limited on their facts or sophomoric. You will save yourself some trouble by reading Chapter 10 (which summarizes the authors' findings) first and than scanning the examples."
5,iphoto assistance,This is a really helpful addition for any mac owner that wants to really use all that iphoto has to offer! Easy to understand even for cyber dummies . (Like me)
5,ONE REALLY GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think that this movie truly portraid the lives of these two 12-year old girls, Allie(walkie-talkie cover, Frog) and Jane (walkie-talkie cover Wombat). Hey! If your're a 12-year old girl just starting sixth grade, you've got one weird, new principal, a cute guy moves in, an army brat is looking for a new best friend, AND your friendship is on the rocks with your baby-chum/ best friend, ""Frog and Wombat"" is what happens! Wombat was wwwwwwwwaaaaaayyyyyyyyy funny!!!!!!!!!!"
3,fun & entertaining movie about two precocious kids,"It was a lot of fun to see this movie at it's premiere in the Nickelodeon Theatre in Santa Cruz (the county where the film was made) with most of the cast and crew. Two of my sons and I were ""extras"" in the movie and had a great time meeting everyone and learning what goes on behind the scenes. Both Katie and Emily have a lot of potential to become stars, especially Katie Stuart. Contratulations to Laurie Agard and everyone at Pigtail Productions. They sure know how to make a movie!!!"
2,Not all that great..........,"Well, this movie isn't as great as all these reviews say. Like it matters, but I was an extra in this movie. Katie Stuart was the only decent actress in this. The others were shall we say......well, I'm not sure how to put it nicely. At any rate, the movie is OK, not great, but lemme just say that I would NOT waste my money on buying it or renting it for that matter. If you are DYING to see it, you should try to find a place that may rent it. If you ask me though, unless this movie was being GIVEN away, I wouldn't waste my time or money."
3,Could Of Been Better,"I love the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", this version, I'm not so sure. I like the idea someone else re-edittng the movie and making it their own, but this movie could of been re-editted better. I am thinking that this is done with a movie editting tool like ""After Effects"", ""Premier"", or ""Final Cut Pro"". I know a lot of the tricks used to re-edit this film. The color transitions is a really easy trick to use in ""Final Cut Pro"", as well as the cutting of the film and transitioning it to other scenes. He even used footage from other sources to tell the story of how the zombies came about. I really think this could of been better. I was expecting better, and was really excited to see this version of it, therefore I was somewhat disappointed in this version. My advice is to see the original first, then see this one."
1,This version is an exercise in what not to do with public domain films...,"Save your money and buy the real black and white, un-re-edited original. This version misses out on the crumbling humanity of Romero's film by cutting most of the pertinent scenes. A terrible waste of effort.The Night of the Living Dead disc from Elite is a good buy."
2,crappy deal!,"BY: A TEENAGE BRATZ FANAs you may know from my pervious review(s), i AM the 1# Bratz fan.This is one of the absolute worst Bratz dolls ive EVER bought!This isn't durable, OR fun!Dont buy it, save yourself!!!!"
4,Tianna's QUITE nice but not as nice as the Yasmin........,Tianna's pretty and her clothes are cool and diva-style yeah though I'm not SO sure about her hair with the red and black. I really don't like black and red together. Tianna's a good fabulous bratz girl but I prefer the Yasmin or the Sasha better>>>>>>>
1,stupid peice!!,"Number one, this toy sucks. its not durable, its hair is dry, and ugly, its hair is wayy too long, i HATE when the red mixes with black, the face is ugly, it isnt durable , its a n ugly peice of worthless crap!(i LOVE BRATZ BUT THIS IS PATHETIC, MAN):( two thumbs down!!PS- I recomend the new Bratz Twiinz: Tess and Nona! I am so happy with those. they have soft pretty hair and gorgeous clothes and theyre actually durable!!!!!"
1,bratz?!!!!!!!!!! or trollz,hi i am jans daughter's friend and i just don't see why you people waist your time on these dolls. and maybe myscene did copy after bratz but bratz copied off of trollz i mean just look at thier heads come on. the only 2 diffrences between bratz and trollz is that bratz hair is boring and it is not poofy like trollz and they think they are wearing clothes that are in style but all there wearing is a string (if you know what i mean). if you guys want a great toy that has a big head then get a troll not these trollz wannabees. or another great toy is gi-joe. he is so cool he can wage war and take over the world.
4,So many New Dolls!,"there are so many new dolls in the bratz collection i just can't keep up! but i really like this one. i think these dolls are awesome for any age and rate them a overall of 4-5 stars! i think Tiana is really pretty and can't wait to try to get her! i highly recommend this doll so buy her !Kristaage 10Hastings, Ny"
1,An absolute waste,"I do not recomend this doll to anyone. As soon as i took it out of the box, the arm fell off (i kid you not!) and the hair got all tangled up. I do not want to ever buy another FABULOUS doll, ever again. This is an absolute waste of money. I don't recomend it.!"
1,you know what!!!!!,"if you people dont beleive this doll is CRAP buy it and take it out of the box and then you'll see how crapy this actually IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this doll is complete GARBAGE.it isn't durable,at all.I am not kidding! beleive me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,a terrible Bratz doll!,"OMG! How can anyone say this doll is durable????I took it out of the box and it's hair was all screwed up and it's arm fell off!I took this peice of cheap crap back to the store! They wouldnt give me my money back, so i burried IT!OKAY. (...) doesn't even have this doll!!WE do! (1, 2 star reviewers) we know what crap this doll is, and crap it is!I won't lie to you, most Bratz dolls are extremly durable!But this one is NOT durable, or fun, or pretty!!!!!Buy FABULOUS Sasha instead! I have both and Sasha is MUCH better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please listen to me i don't lie this peice of crap fell apart!"
2,I'm not impressed,"While still in the box, i thought this doll was beautiful. But when i took her out of the box, i was extremly disapointed. The hair, in about a weekend, became matted and ugly. The red and black mixed together, which i HATED. And for the price ($30 Canadian) I would have expected MANY more accessories, and better quality. I definetly don't recomend this doll, unless you are planning on leaving it IN the box. It will just be a HUGE disapointment, trust me. Don't waste your money."
2,A review by someone who actually OWNS this doll!,"I bought this doll MONTHS ago and when i took her out of the box i loved her...at first, that is....After about 2 days, her hair became SUCH a mess, it was extremly hard to brush. For $30 (In Canada) i would have expected much more acessories and WAY better quality. I have to admit, though, this doll is pretty. The theme is great, whoever came up with it, bravo! But the quality is outragously poor, at least for the Bratz. The belt for the doll's pants broke, and i can't even have a refund! I want a refund! This is one of the WORST Bratz purcheses i have EVER made! I am highly disapointed in this doll. Anyone who thinks the quality of this doll is good must not be thinking! You could buy TWO sportz dolls for the price of this (at least in Canada!!!)"
5,BE CAREFUL,"The red maple bonsai tree was received in excellent condition. Do not let it set in direct sunlight, it will burn the edge of the leaves. A wind gust turned the tree on its side and a large root broke in half. This caused a problem that would not allow the tree to set upright. I called the provider and he said to tie it down and the broken root would not cause the tree any problems. I did what he said and the tree seems to be alright, however it doesn't look very good because of the tie down. I was not offered a refund of replacement. Be careful not to set this tree where wind or direct sun will cause it harm."
4,This book teaches what is essential and what is junk.,"After reading this book, you will have perfect criteria to judge each and every syllable and its worthiness in a screenplay. You will also learn some helpful hints about the business end as well. All that is needed is a chapter on formatting."
2,Buy another game,"So this game has great potential, awesome storyline, awesome characters, such a great base. But the gameplay quickly takes it all away. Only one superpower, very little in way of changing hits, and everytime you fight a boss you get whipped because you cannot do anything. Want to do something more worthwhile? Go buy the new X-men game"
2,"Multiplayer Yes, Story No","I'm just going to do a quick rant on how this game is builtPros:1. The multi-player fighting mode is fun and very entertaining.2. Good characters1. The game is frustrating to play in story mode because all of the elements are off and not tweaked to perfection... example: Magneto as a boss is easier to kill than a robot who shoots a beam at you in the level.That shouldn't be even possible!2. The robots are insanely good towards the end.3. Who wants to keep destroying robots4. Graphics aren't that great, but have a gothic feel to them.5. Overall just isn't that great of a game."
3,how the heck do you beat van roekel?,"Luckily I got this game on sale. All the other reviewers that commented on the level of frustration endured are absolutely right. This is one of those games where you wonder whether you're *finally* beating the bosses because there's a 1/100 chance of beating them and you just ended up playing it 100 times.That said, anyone have any suggestions for how to beat van roekel? I can't find anyway to turn off his power recharge and he just keeps gaining all his health back."
2,Marvel Nemesis is adictive to play but.....,"I get easily frustrated, annoyed and confuse when playing that game. I played games like that and this one of the games that looks good, character wise. The fighting system is limited with one button to press, the camera angle is a joke, the blocking is confusing and all and all it's sloppy and there are no target system where you can target your enemies.I could not beat the entire game though it is still adictive and fun to play I still get frustrated from that game. If you're an amatuer like me then don't buy it there are better games than this one, but if you're a fan of the game then go for it."
4,Very Tricky,"I have written only a couple of reviews, this one I chose because I thought it was a very good game. Don't listen to the other people. This game is fabulous. Very little flaws. The levels sometimes can be tricky. Many of the characters you like to see are in it. Many are not. Good characters are Wolverine, Elektra, Spidey, Venom, etc. Sometimes, this game makes you want to throw the controller at the TV, but you must restrain yourself and keep trying.Graphics - 5Gameplay - 4 1/2Fun - 4 1/2Challenging - 2ENJOY!"
1,Horrible Text,This book is absolutely horrible! If you have to use this book for your nursing class I suggest you buy Nursing Fundamentals Reviews & Rationales by Mary Hogan. I feel sorry for anyone who has to use this book for their nursing studies.
2,Better books are available,This book was the required text during my first semester of nursing school. I didn't like this book at all. I found it very difficult to read and follow. There are much better textbooks available.
2,Wordy and Hard to follow.,"This has been one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. The authors are very wordy which makes the text confusing. It is difficult to understand why is the most used next in nursing. Other fundamental texts are much more readable, clearer, and precise. I found that Potter and Perry took so long to explain a simple concept that I often forgot the point of what I was reading.If your a first year nursing student who is required to use this book I suggest looking ahead and purchasing your Medical-Surgical Nursing text now. It will have the nearly same information in a much better format and will greatly help you through fundamentals.If your a professor, there are much better fundies texts on the market."
2,i didnt like it at all,"very hard to study from, like other reviewer said, its too cluttered and it makes it hard to focus on the main points."
2,Poor text,Not at all happy with being forced to purchase this for school. This is one really heavy book. Might be better to find the information in other places. Overall I like the book but like others have said the information tends to be repetitive for repetitions sake.
2,Hours of searching,I also am a 1st semester nursing student and this is the required text. I dislike this book and I do not see why we use it. Everything is scattered everywhere. To look for a certain concept you have to look to all over for everything.
1,Horrible Text,"This book has a horrible layout and is poorly organized. The text is often times not very clear. Don't even get me started on the skills steps and rationales, have fun reading those tedious wordy procedures (the figures don't even match up with the steps). Don't even bother purchasing the workbook that goes along with this text because it doesn't help, it doesn't match up with the book either. What this book needs is more editing and a completely different layout that is user friendly for 1st year nursing students. The best thing about this book is the website that goes along with it (except even some of the answer rationales contradict what's in the book). If it were possible I would give this book a 0 star rating."
2,Fundamentals workbook and review questions,"Our class found many errors in the exercises. It will ask for 11 fundamentals of Gordans but not list them. The exercises will ask for 6 theories of something and there will be 5. One Chapter has 10 answers but 9 answers in the book.Material in book is easy to read, just can't depend or use the workbook."
1,Awful textbook,"I am an RN student and this is the worst textbook I have had. The ideas in it are really scattered, so it is difficult to find anything in it. The chapters are extensive, for no reason and with minimal content."
1,What a painful book to read!!!,While this book does cover all of the fundamentals of nursing Perry and Potter have some real issues with filtering out what is important. The book is put together quite well chapter wise yet is much much too wordy. My major problem with this text is the shear length of the chapters. I find that I can read other books and get the same if not more information in a much more student friendly format and in about half the time. If you get stuck with this book get the study guide and work out each chapter along with the book. It makes reviewing the material much quicker and more focused.
3,Historical,"The songs are decent but Mr. Best is correct. The quality of the studio or the ""combo"" here does not match his work with The Beatles. Listen to his drumming on early Beatles recordings and you'll wonder ---as have millions----why they ever got that guy Ringo."
3,Best of The Beatles,"Pete Best is still getting a bum rap. Go into it with an open mind, and you'll find that this album is not half-bad. In fact, some songs such as ""The Way I Feel About You,"" ""I'll Try Anyway"" and ""Keys To Your Heart"" are well worth your while. The Pete Best Combo was not The Beatles, but they had a cool British ""garage"" sound that shouldn't be written off by snob critics. A second-rate Herman's Hermits? I'd take that as a compliment! I'd sure as heck rather listen to this album than ""Abbey Road"" or The White Album again."
1,"If this is the best he has to offer, then it's a shame.","There is a reason that Pete Best was replaced as drummer for the world's best known band. He simply was not very good. Uninspired vocal performances, poor choices of cover material, and uninteresting drumming make this CD unlistenable. Pete Best was replaced in 1962 for a reason. Lack of talent and charisma."
2,"Cheap quality, do not be fooled","Imagine the cheapest pillows you can find, and then imagine a pillow one step up. This is what you get from this product, a ""second-to-the-worst"" product you can imagine. Not recommended for nightly use as it is poorly stitched and insufficiently stuffed. This pillow has no support. Maybe it can go in the guest bedroom, but even at these prices, you can do better for your guests. And don't bother trying to return it to Amazon either, they'll take all the value of it back because of shipping charges."
2,Every pillow in the set came apart the first night,"Length:: 1:04 MinsThe pillows literally tore at the seams the very first night I used them -- all of them. They're soft, and still moderately usable in pillow cases, but the construction of mine was incredibly poor. Without a pillow case, you'd have pillow innards everywhere."
1,Horrible!!,I am so disappointed! These pillows were for my kids and they only lasted maybe 3 days!! They are all ripped apart at the seems....I want my money back...I ordered another set a few weeks ago when they were 24.99 and they are great.....don't waste your money
1,Great product if you like being poked my feathers!,"This is perfect if you like to be awakened 40 times a night from being stabbed from the sharp end of feathers! As I plucked out what seemed like the thousand feather, they made the fast track to my local landfill.Complete waste of money."
3,LUXURY BED PILLOWS,"I LIKE THE FEEL AND LOOK OF THE PILLOWS, MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT THEY ARE COMMING APART AT THE SEAMS AND ARE RIPPING. I DON'T LIKE TO SEW. I HOPE THAT ALL OF THE PILLOWS ARE NOT GOING TO DO THE SAME THING. I PURCHASED ABOUT 16. I AM HAVING TO SEW THEM BACK TOGETHER. I DO LIKE THE PILLOWS BUT NOT IF THEY ARE ALL GOING TO COME APART AFTER YOU SLEEP ON THEM FOR TWO DAYS. PLEASE HELP MAKE THEM HOLD TOGETHER BETTER. AND TO HOLD TOGETHER LONGER. THEY DO FEEL VERY CONFORTABLE TO SLEEP ON. I LIKE THE FIRMNESS OF THE PILLOW. PLEASE HELP WHOM EVER IS MAKING THESE PILLOWS. THEY ARE AT A GOOD PRICE. I AM DISABLED AND NEED ALOT OF PILLOWS FOR MY HEAD AND TO RISE MY LEGS. HAD TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENTS AND SURGERY 8 TIMES. NEED SOMETING STRONG AND SUPPORTIVE BUT CONFORTABLE. MUST ALSO HAVE THEM TO PLACE INBETWEEN BY LEGS AT NIGHT SO MY LEGS DON'T OVER CROSS EACH OTHER. THANK YOU D GILMORE A LITTLE DISPOINTED!!!"
2,Easily torn but repairable,"Three out of four were torn within a month after normal use. The last one was torn after two months. Apparently the part with the care instruction tag sewn together is weak. But I did't take that serious, because the price wasok, I just wanted a number of inexpensive clean pillowes, and I could fix them (I just sewed again as I like fixing things.) What you pay is what you get."
2,Ripped off!,"I never had a pillow fall apart on me but this one did! I woke up after a week or two of using them to find a seam ripped and oozing with stuffing. These pillows are very soft, but flatten out too quickly. Luxury is definitely not a word I'd use to describe them! I'm going back to Linens & Things to get some quality pillows."
1,Don't Last!!!,"I ignored the reviews and purchased these pillows because I had guests coming into town in September and needed a quick, cheap set of pillows for them to use. At first, I was really happy with the pillows... they were very comfortable, soft, and they looked like nice pillows. My husband and I even decided to use a couple in the master bedroom after our guests left. This was a bad idea. After only a couple of months, the end seam split on both of our pillows and the stuffing started to come out of the end. I expected them to last for at least a year, but they didn't even make it two months. At leasts our guests got good use of them, but we won't make that mistake again."
1,WARNING- FLAMMABLE,Sleep better? How could you sleep better when your pillow has a WARNING- FLAMABLE label? Scary. The pillows are soft but does not have great neck support. I'm usually a side or stomach sleeper. The pillows are better for hugging.
3,Disappointing Sound,"This CD was a disappointment to me. Yes, Fox was an unusually gifted organist, and he has interesting performances here. But I was hoping to hear Fox in the sterling sound for which Reference Recordings is known. This is a live recording with audience noises. More importantly, to my ears the sound of the organ is lost on this recording in a distant, highly rounded off sound. There is even a disclaimer on the package that the CD is not up to RR standards. I wish I had known that before buying it. If you want to hear Fox, that won't matter to you. If the sound is important, I would pass on this one."
5,a great buy,"From the mind of Alan Wilder, comes another fantasic album. Every song on here is true deforce, of sound."
2,Not as good as Bloodline,The songs on this album were a dissapointment. The material on earlier albums were more enjoyable. The songs on this cd are very weird! I didn't like but two or three songs.
4,Dark and Attractive,"Dark and seductive, with musical influences ranging from trip hop,gospel and hadcore techno, Recoil's Unsound Methods is Alan Wilder's best achievement. Thanks to Recoil, Wilder was able to let loose and explore new musical grounds, distancing himself from the more conventional sound of his former band, Depeche Mode. Each song has layers of samples, orchestrations and sound effects that keep the listeners coming back for more. Incubus, the strongest track on the album, is based on Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Douglas McCarthy's somber vocals gives the track an even darker feel. Other invited vocalists, such as Siobhan Lynch, make Unsound Methods one of the best records of the past years."
5,Love's Old Country Music,"This is the best collection there is of Waylon. But there is 2 songs I wish were on here and they are: The first making of McAURTHER PARK, and WILLIE AND LAURA MAE JONES. Other wise I just LOVE this SET!!!!!!!!!!!. This is a MUST HAVE for any Waylon Jennings fan."
5,Great Representation of a Country Outlaw legend!,There have been many catalogs issued over the years of Waylon Jennings music but nothing even comes close to comparing to this! If you are a Die Hard Waylon Jennings fan like I am then this is the only thing YOU HAVE TO BUY. PERIOD!!!! THIS COLLECTION COVERS IT ALL. IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!
2,Good compilation--poor recording,"While this compilation or collection of Waylon Jennings songs is one of the best, it is sadly lacking in audio quality. Depending on the track, the singing is way too soft or extremely loud. It appears there was no attempt to equalize the recordings. The rating of 2 was provided because the songs are good, but averaging out, equals only a two because of the poor quality of reproduction."
3,Great! Waylon Fans You Gotta Love It!,"I've waited years for this. A great and affordable overview of Waylon's career on four discs. Wonderful! Marvelous! Yes! Yes! This is a must have. I would have bought it just for the song Green River, a little known ballad by Waylon that is just special. Cd #1 has all his great early stuff and is Wunderbar! The rest of the cds have all his other great songs. The only two songs I would have loved to have on this set is Weakness In A Man and Poor Old Ugly Gladys Jones, which was a novelty song Waylon did with Country song writer Don Bowman, Bobby Bare, and Willie Nelson (Both songs only available on Bear Family label). Well, forgive me for being greedy. Thank you Sony and BMG. The Johnny Cash box and now Waylon Jennings, WOW! it doesn't get better than this! Maybe Roy Orbison will be next. Nashville Rebel, don't leave the record store without it!"
2,Not enough woof,"I read about half of this book. There was a lot detailed information about Hume's positioning in English and French Societies and Rousseau's many problems, but nothing that engaged me with these characters. It was not very novelistic and there was not much discussion of their ideas or of the broad social and intelectual contexts that made them interesting. Maybe things picked up in the second half."
1,Product Eval.,"Picture presents what looks like a full replacement set of door and ignition lock cylinders. However, I received only the ignition lock cylinder today and a small bag with soiled nitrile (purple) gloves in an overly large box. Whereas the replacement item will work in the application. It would have been cheaper to get the full set locally, which is what I was after, and not have to dispose of the shippers trash. I wonder if that is how they justify their stiff shipping fees? Let the buyer beware..."
4,Great Reference! Everything in one place; lots of info.,"This is a wonderful book for the serious collector that has to stay on top of pricing guidelines. It has a huge range of products, lots of pictures, detailed descriptions, and is easy to use. I'm always searching for another Star Trek Collectible reference, but none is as well done. The only problem is it needs to be updated."
4,Worth a Beam-Up,"Nice book. A little dated not having many recent collectibles. I was able to find who made the Starfleet Class Ring I was trying to find out about for years, so I was very happy. I wish it had more pictures. Generally this was a good buy and worth having."
4,Nice little table and chairs,"We were looking for a table and chairs that our three year olds could use over a period of years. This fits the bill. They will be able to use this until they are 8 or 9 at least. The cubby holes are great for collecting all kinds of papers and treasures that little children can think of. We bought the pecan, but it is more like a very light cherry rather than pecan. We didn't want painted wood...Pretty though. Also the legs holes were poorly drilled and the screws kind of cheap. We went to Lowes and bought new screws and it all worked out fine. It's VERY sturdy (we bought the one with the straight legs.) Worth the money."
3,Good,"We got this as a gift to our grandchild. It is nice looking and very sturdy. However, the tabletop was discolored. There was a six inch wide strip across the entire right edge of the tabletop. We didn't feel we could give this table as a gift."
3,delivery problems,"Product is well-made, attractive, and easy assembly. Ordered 2 sets for grandchildren for Xmas and had delivery problems with both. One was missing some parts and the other arrived with a badly damaged tabletop.Serenas responded quickly but the replacement on one arrived in Jan after the holidays. This is probably a freight problem but buyers should be aware that this is a heavy product and subject to shipping problems. And the freight charges are high! Pa grandmom"
3,i am semi-happy,"ordered this, plus 2 more chairs. the table looks nice, was very easy to assemble. came quick with no damages. good packaging. the issue is the length of the seat. its too long. i have 3 boys: 6, 3 and 1. only my 6 yr old can bend his knees and put his feet down while his back is up against the chair. if i could do over, i wouldn't of bought, but there were very few choices in what i wanted that had the quality. this for sure has the quality, but the seat needs to be shortned by about 3-6 inches."
3,Grandchildren Table and 2 chairs,"As other reviewers said, the ""cherry"" of the table and chairs has a lot of orange in it so it is not as rich looking as I had hoped. We purchased the square table and it is a perfect size for the space we have and the desire to have a separate table where the grandchildren can sit and play. Our grandchildren are on their way across country so we have yet to see the table in action. The ordering and delivery process was seamless."
1,Not working in less than a month of use,"This unit was connected worked with my system less than a month, now it is NOT working. Not ejecting nor showing anything on my TV screen. I've tried everything it said to do in the manual yet it has NO capability of playing nor ejecting a CD or DVD.I am truly dissapointed since we purchased this item recently. I should have bought the Gateway unit."
2,"Useful material perhaps, but poor presentation","I think it is unfortunate when a high income ""consultant"" cannot write a proper sentence. I found the book very hard to read. I would really like to advise the author on the importance of proper punctuation, especially on using commas, dashes, and semicolons in the right places."
4,Good content - poor tape quality,Beautiful presentation of excellent technique. Tape quality is poor and sound not good. Worth buying anyway if you love mime.
1,RUN DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS TOOL,I bought this tool three years ago and using it only occasionally have spent more on repairs than the tool cost in the first place. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,Bigger & Better than I thought it would be!!,I have 4 small children (living in an apartment) and going to the laundry facility to the laundry was impossible. I got the machine and the matching dryer and they both work great! It has definately made my life easier and the clothes are so much cleaner than before. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Haier Portable Washer,It came damaged with a few dents.Rear casters are not removable.Other than that the washer works fine and very quiet.I also can't find Y adapter at stores.
3,haier portable washing machine,Washing Machine was received 6 days before expected delivery date.UPS left machine outside all evening.Box was undamaged but numerous dents found in front and side of machine when removed from 2 packing boxes.Dents were made from inside of machine.Have used machine about 20 times.Works well.
2,Narrow,"There is a tremendous breadth promised in the title, (Social welfare in the South, 1830-1930), however the collection of articles contained in this book is remarkably narrow. Perhaps this book is merely misnamed, and instead it should be: Women's Social Welfare in Georgia and selected parts of the South, 1830-1930. That is all delivers, so if you are looking for a broader overview, look elsewhere."
4,Easy reading.,Easy reading. Gives you a entertaining description of Abe Lincoln as well as the time he grew up in. Good book.
4,Full of the humor of Abe Lincoln,I really enjoyed this book for it's easy read and flow of the stories and narratives of Abraham Lincoln's life starting from a back country lawyer to President of the United States.
1,What on earth?,"What on earth was Harper Collins thinking when they published this? I feel as if I wasted money and I borrowed it from the library. The characters are hideous, unbelievable, and unlikable. And so are their lives. Lily, who supposedly has a graduate degree, speaks like a sixth grader. Pia is prostrated by grief yet suddenly marries. And Beth, are we supposed to relate to her? Ugh. Just awful."
4,pathophysiology book,The book was what I ordered. Description was precise. The service was fast and the packaging was protective from damage. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,Not what I ordered,I received a book that was not what I ordered. I ordered the seventh edition and was sent the sixth edition. For college courses I relly need exactly what I ordered. But the return process was easy and not at all cumbersome.
2,Be Ready for a Challenge,"First shipment I received was damaged, however, it was returned with no problem. Second shipment was damaged, again. I attempted to fix it myself because I like the cabinet. It looks good, it's just not made well. There are no instructions for mounting and the hardware it comes with is absolutely worthless. It was extremely frustrating getting it all to work out. After a trip to the hardware store and some creative thinking, it's hanging and functional...again, it LOOKS good...i just hope it stays that way."
3,"Looks great, arrived damaged :(","I was so happy to receive free shipping, but when we opened it one door had fallen off completely, and as we were fixing it the other hinge fell off. It looks great, however you are going to need some tools and patience if you are going to make it work."
2,Cheap Quality,"I had to request a replacement for this item because the first one was damaged before it arrived. The replacement dartboard arrived damaged as well. It is a nice looking dart board and a good deal on the price, unfortunately I was never able to use it, seeing as it broke both times. It was not a minor default that could be fixed. The wood literally split apart on the cabinet making it unable to hang. I found a nicer and even better deal on a dartboard and cabinet at Walmart."
1,Terrible - Don't waste your time,Just like several other reviews; mine came broken. Too much hassle to ship it back as the whole box had just fallen apart. Wound up just pulling the darts and board and threw away the case.NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE LOST TIME. AMAZON SHOULD ASK MFG TO PACK BETTER AND USE BETTER CONSTRUCTIONS ON WHERE THE WOOD JOINS.
4,Great Value on this Dartboard Set,"Really happy with this buy. Came ready to go and looks good. Only issue is that one of the darts broke, but since all of the darts have already fallen on a cement floor dozens of times - this seems reasonable."
1,Damaged Goods,"Product was damaged when I got it. The screws attaching the doors to the body were stripped, and the ""wood"" wasn't even real wood which was the reason for the screws being stripped. If the quality of the wood was better, I believe that the doors would be pretty securely attached."
2,DVD Region Issues | Will Not Play All DVD's | Despite Description,"The look, feel and function of this DVD player is exceptional. A great value. However, with 15 DVD's selected, only four will play. It will not play newer DVD's no matter what system (NTSC or PAL).Even though this system says it will play both; the standard region one NTSC - NORTH AMERICA USA CANADA have problems and the DVD will show the 'Non compatible region screen'Be sure that you understand this when purchasing any Pyle product DVD player. I have contacted Pyle and the seller to try and discover a work around. I am making backups of a few of the non-working DVD's today to see if they will work.I tested all DVD disks on a second COBY and SONY brand DVD player, they work fine."
5,"If you want to make lots of money, you need this book!","Previous garage sales I had held weren't a big success, so I purchased this book to help me do better. At the time my husband thought I was crazy, but did he change his tune! Les R. Schmeltz's book was wonderful. It helped me from beginning to end. By following his tips throughout the book we sold everything. My husband was shocked at the amount of money we made! People that came actually complimented us on our set-up and signs, one of the many things Mr. Schmetlz stated was an important feature for a garage sale. And I loved his ""checklist"" at the back of his book. If you want to have a great and successful garage sale, this book is a must!"
2,The author needs a course in brevity...,"This book is packed with information; too much information. I couldn't read over 200 pages on how to do a garage sale the right way! Mr. Schmeltz' ""research"" after studying a ""thousand"" garage sales doesn't take the place of actual experience. He treated the topic like a college essay, not an easy-to-use how-to on garage sales. I wonder how many who purchased this book actually read it cover to cover?"
2,Terrible job,"The plot sounded promising, but the author failed to deliver. The characters are ridicilously unbelievable. There are ten 28 year-old men, and none of them have a normal lifestyle - one is a monk, one is a professional clown, one gambles at Las Vegas casinos for his income, one lives in the woods as a recluse, etc. Give me a break... Also, the dialogue is rushed and choppy. I had a hard time believing that Artie would take a two hour flight to have a two minute, uneventful conversation with one of his clones.Most importantly, perhaps, is that the killer is purposefully revealed in the first 80 pages. I was hoping for a mystery where the reader has to guess which of the clones was the culprit. That was not the case. The only reason I read further was to be introduced to the rest of the Artie Singleton ""zoo"" (the ten characters) for a good laugh. In that sense, the book was entertaining (hence, the second star). Otherwise, it was a major disappointment."
3,Fantastic premise but not well written or developed..,"Once again an author takes a fantastic idea for a novel and totally messes it up in the writing. It is as bad as it can be withou being totally horrible. The premise is interesting and intriguing and full of promise for a great story. But alas, this one fall short of its promise. Should you read it? I think so, just to get the premise and story basics into your own mind. The reader can do a better job of rewriting the story in ones head so that it reaches closer to its original potential."
3,Like a modern conspiracy theorist,"Underwood has amassed, mastered and transmitted an enormous amount of detailed information on ancient and mediaeval building in Britain. Unfortunately, he ties all of this into his notion of ""geodetic"" forces that he thinks dominate the earth, especially through its underground water. He feels called upon, as well, to address the issue of the connections between Freemasonry and this sort of stuff. The reason for this effort is unclear and his conclusions unclear as well.This is a great example of an old-time English hobbyist, charming in his earnest eccentricity, but not necessarily of any significance aside from being proof of his neighbor's tolerance. Far more sweet-tempered than the lunatics who now say they believe that Barack Obama is worse than Hitler, or, at least, that George Bush was behind the 9/11 attacks, but no more credible."
1,NOT SATISFIED,"I can't really review this toy because it did not work when I received it. I have contacted the seller via email and no response, it has been a week. I am not satisfied AT ALL with this product or the seller!!!!"
4,funny pen,the office talking pen is so funny i love to push it just to her it say the saying that are on it
2,Disappointing,When the pen first arrived it would not make any sounds because it had gotten to cold in my mail box. Once it warmed up it played the quotes but the voices are not true to the show characters. If you are actually a fan of the show this will be a disapointment.
2,"cute book, but...","This is a really cute book, but upon opening it the disappointment was great. It reminds me of those 101 things to do in a bathroom type of lists that are passed around in emails; the advices were THAT short and many were common sense, about 10 advices in the book actually were helpful but those would easily have been found in other books. If you're looking for a college prep guide, don't waste your money. If you just want a cute book to give as presents, then by all means..."
2,Disappointingly slim volume of rather obvious hints,A bit of a waste of time really. The tips offered are rather obvious and not particularly insightful. Not much content.
1,I should have read the reviews first,"My mistake, I should have read the customer reviews before I spent $6.95 on this silly little book. I was so irritated upon opening my box from Amazon but I realized it was my fault for not scrolling down to see what other said about it. It takes about two minutes to read and even though the advice is good it isn't worth the money at all."
1,101 Things A College Girl Should Know,This is an absolute waste of money. This book should be priced at $1.00. This tiny book has little content and is a ripoff.
2,Cute book filled with medicore common sense.,"My sister is graduating high school this weekend, and I got this book as a part of her gift.Lets just say, as a big sister who has a little sister who is going off to college, this book, or should I say booklet, is an absolute fail. I still got it because I think its cute. However, this is a very mediocre book when it comes to college advise. I suggest looking into other booksSeriously, I could have written a better book."
3,101 Things a College Girl Should Know,Light and easy reading. Easy to refer to quickly. Advice that freshmen girls could really use.
4,good book but slightly lacking,"Someone gave this book to me during my freshman year of college. I read it quickly and laughed along at some parts as I realized that I had indeed already made those mistakes. By far this book is not an all-inclusive guide to college, but it does have some helpful tidbits. Even the parts that say, ""drink water, get enough sleep"" are good reminders for college girls, who often overlook these things as they get busy and in a new environment. I plan on giving this book to my younger sister when she graduates high school next year, but I intend to write some comments in the book after the author's advice, which is always a good idea to give it a more personal touch, and since some of the things in the book are slightly outdated."
5,No better bang for your buck.,"This thing is huge! I think it could double as a sleeping bag for you beanpole type of guys.It has so many compartments in it. I'm about to leave on a short boarding trip and I don't think I'll have to even pack another bag! This thing will hold my helmet, boots, board, shaving kit and a few days of clothes for both on and off the mountain... assuming you don't load it down with multiple boards. I'm carrying one board.I searched SEVERAL sites for a padded bag with wheels and I'm convinced there is no better bang for your buck. Similar bags are closer to a Benjamin.. plus it looks really cool."
5,EG - Better than ever!,"The only thing better than a new bluesy CD from EG is seeing her live! IF you ever have a chance to spend an evening with EG Kight don't miss out, you will be on your feet yelling for more! This CD comes as close to experiencing EG live as any she has put out and I own them all. She has teamed up with some talented musicians who allow EG to shine and connect with her songs in a very personal and moving experience. The blues never sound so true and so good at the same time, this Georgia gal really soars with this recording!"
3,It's Aww-right!,"I'm not a huge fan of Miami Bass/ Rap or ""Booty, but I must say that this album has it's good points. The rapper has the voice and the right words, but I think that the skits are pointless. Sounds like a movie, it's like ""get to the point"" and stick to the party music. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album should get the party moving."
5,A whole lot of bang for the buck.,"This was an amazing deal. 2GB of Corsair DDR ram, with heat spreaders...For $50!!! All I did was plug it in and my computer was up to 3GB of ram. Corsair is continually the best performing memory on the market and it shows."
5,A great compilation,"A great compilation...while not including some of my favorites, this CD does have some of their best, most memorable songs. Everyday; Mrs. Steeles song; Old Hayes; Seattle afternoon; 3 a.m.; I don't know why; Bewitched, bothered and bewildered; Chestnut tree; Dancing in the Dark; Palo Alto Cowboy; Mendecino (my favorite); Billy & Slugger; Pioneer Square; Bramble and the Rose; Did Beethoven Do the Dishes; Thats the way that the world goes round; River; the I ain't gettin' it blues; and Delicate Balance. This singer songwriter duo has wonderful harmony, and a mix of funny, sad and catchy sing-along tunes. I discovered them first at Folklife Festival in Seattle and have followed their music ever since. Too bad their vinyl isn't all on CD."
1,"Reilly & Maloney, a Collection","Prior to spending $49.99 + for this one (1) CD ""used!"" it would be nice to view a track list (songs!) of the compilation as I once owned and loved all of their LPs. Why is this not listed ????????"
5,Chomsky nails it again!,"This is the kind of concise brilliance you can expect from Chomsky on the topic of propaganda:In Manufacturing Consent, co-authored with Edward Herman, Chomsky proposed a model of the mass media that moulds this consent with bias and omission. ""Propaganda is to democracy what violence is to totalitarianism,"" they wrote. While some see the ""propaganda model"" as reducing everyone to dupes or liars, others have dismissed it as conspiracy theory. ""It's exactly the opposite - it's free-market theory,"" says Chomsky. ""The media are major corporations. They sell a product (readers or viewers) to a market (advertisers). If a Martian were looking at this system, what would he expect? That the media product would be shaped by the perspectives and interests of the sellers and buyers and the external conditions (the state). You'd expect no interaction at all. It's no more a conspiracy than that General Motors tries to make a profit.""[...]"
2,I feel ripped off,"I was disappointed (to say the least) with this product. Audio was awful (re-recorded radio shows I think) too low to hear but when I'd turn it up, he'd start ""yelling"". The ""chapters"" were organized in some fashion but it wasn't logical. The material was repeated from one ""show"" to another.I made a bad choice.Jay"
2,Title sounds like what he wants to do,"I may agree a little with his basic point but he VASTLY overstates the issue. I could write for an hour listing cases where the press challenged the status quo in government, business ,etc. He is just not happy because it is not a 24 hour a day propaganda machine for the left. They sometimes have to, for example, challenge corrupt liberals (like the govenor of Illinois and the mayor of Detroit) in the name of the truth."
4,There is a point in time where it gets old.,"The Alien thrillogy was well thought out and acted out of the scrupts very well, but after part two the plot got old very quickly. It got boring as being part of the same series. The directors should make an Alien vs. Predator movie and end it all there, once and for all. Alien Ressurection was a great movie filled with action, suspense, and twist, but the plot itself is tiring."
3,OK,"This book is very informative and has a lot of history in it, but it is so very boring to read. I would not recommend this book to people who are looking for an engaging reading experience, but if you are just looking for the information, it certainly has it."
5,Wonderful introduction to Duluth,"Lovely photographs, informative text. After having lived in Duluth, I was trilled to find brand new delights as well as being introduced to historic places and facts. Fully descriptive of all kinds of places and events without sounding or feeling like advertisements. Great book if you wish to learn more about Duluth."
3,Orchestral elevator music,"Well, I guess I know now why I am not familiar with Sir Granville Bantock's music. It really is very nice to listen to, and this is a more than adequate recording, but musically it may have more appeal to non-serious listeners than it does to me. I would say that it is lovely background music but when it comes to the time I devote to quality classical listening, I think I'll stick with the other B's (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms) and Sibelius and Copland and Stravinsky ... and many others, but this will end my investigation into this particular composer."
5,An outstanding series of works by an outstanding orchestra,"This is the first disc of the RPO/Hyperion/Handley collaboration that is a sonic masterpiece. If you like Bruckner, Mahler, Elgar, and any of the composers that use full orchestral writing (lots of horns!), you will love this disc and the ones that follow. Listen to this one, and you will be hooked."
2,You get what you pay for,All the pictures that i took with this lens have a foggy cast to them. I think it is because the crystal quality is bad.
5,easy to use!,"attaches easily and takes fisheye photos. the only problem is that the photos are never SUPER sharp, but the quality is about what i expected from such an awesomely low cost product."
1,"""Complete""? Don't believe it.","If you have a shop library with more than one book in it, you don't need this. If you have any experience in woodworking, you don't need this. You can check the ""Look Inside"" feature above, but each item listed in the table of contents is treated only superficially.I have now sworn off all woodworking books with ""Complete""; ""Ultimate""; etc. anywhere in the title or description. My experience with them has shown that nothing could be further from the truth. This book is a perfect example."
2,Not very much useful information.,"I would have to agree with the other review. Most other books cover this information in more detail and go way beyond.I would recommend ""the complete book of woodworking"" It is about 480 pages with 150 pages of reference and the rest of nice project plans, pictures and tips."
3,4 or 5 letter word hangman,"If you overlook the fact that this gale is limited to 4 or 5 letter words only then it's a lot of fun...for about 5 minutes. The 2 player mode is a lot of fun and allows up to 5 letter words so you can do less than 4 letters. The other player has to look away from the screen while you're entering your word, but it's still 10 minutes of fun if you have nothing better to do."
1,Not recommended,"I have a mini chihuahua who weighs about 3-4 pounds. I bought the small size in this pet carrier, and it's too small even for my tiny dog. He actually fits in the carrier the right way, but it doesn't provide any support, so he hangs off the front of my chest with his front feet sticking out, looking like he's about to fall out of the carrier. Because his back legs are also sticking out and can't support him, he slumps over to the side, which can't be good for his back! Bottom line, this carrier doesn't feel safe and is definitely not comfortable for the dog. He hates it. If it weren't such a hassle to return, I'd get a refund."
3,cute but too large,"The quality is great, but if you have a small dog (mine is 5 lbs) it's too large. I had to have it altered in order for it to fit.Either way, it was the nicest one I found and at the best price :)"
3,Doesnt stick well,Probably user error but I did clean all area with soap and water and let the area dry. Still began to peel off without much effort.
2,Obsolete theory,"This book was seminal in its time as the first to propose that trade relations were the ultimate cause of the wars fought among the Eastern Woodland tribes of North America in the 17th century. This theory, based primarily on marxist concepts of trade being a fundamentally evil activity at the source of many conflicts, has been largely discredited today.For a better overview of this subject, check out the Iroquois Wars I & II, available from Amazon.com, which offer excerpts from the primary sources themselves and tell a much different story from Mr. Hunt's faulty interpretation."
5,Very Motivational & Helpful,I use motivational quotes in my coaching all of the time! This book is an excellent resource.
5,Works Great!,This cable works great with all of my firewire products such as my external hard drives. Cheap price and great shipping. Quality product. Thanks!
2,Last only three years,Purchased 1/09 already broke. Price was good but labor to install a part that will fail in a few years made it a poor buy.
2,"Easy, cheezy ending","Kushner's world in ""Privilege"" is interesting and complex, and she writes well. I wanted to be interested in a young woman, forced to learn to sword fight by her crazy, malicious uncle. I wanted to like and admire her. However like ""Swordspoint"", I didn't like Our Heroine or most of the other characters.I loathed the too easy, unbelievably cheerful ending."
2,tasteless,"The 'Privilege of the Sword' was a novel that had a truly exciting premise, but ended up being quite flavorless. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen, and was sadly dissapointed. Not only was the plot some what bland, the characters (save for the mad duke, who was done really well) were weak and underdeveloped. I never really got to know the main character. On the whole, I felt cheated out of what could have been a great story."
4,Loads of fun; a real relief from cookie-cutter fantasy!,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I've not read Kushner's previous works, and had not even heard of them until I read this.This book was a wonderfully enjoyable read, and the story was fun and moved quickly. The characters were interesting, and while I never developed a strong dislike for any of the characters (and really only liked a very few), their interactions were fascinating and kept me reading.Compared to many of the books I read, this story was like candy: an easy read that didn't demand much of me, but engaged be effectively by being different from all the other books I've read over the last several years. This was quite a refresher after the moderate-to-heavy fare I've been reading these last few months.Well written, Ms. Kushner!"
5,a fantastic blend,"Written word meets visual image in this forced marriage of Chagall and cummings. The poem, ""May I Feel Said He"" is matched almost perfectly with various Chagall paintings; I feel as though the partnership between the two forms of art is in itself amazing."
2,Outdated,"I bought this book for my Mom as a guide. After looking through it I returned it the next day. It was published in 2006 but you wouldn't know that by the information it gives. It tells the mother that she is the one dealing with the vendors. In my personal situation, mom is having nothing to do with vendors, my fiance and I will be the ones meeting and choosing. The book leaves the groom out a lot, leaving decisions up to mom and bride and to take groom into consideration. Towards the end of the book there is a day of schedule, telling the mother to ""gently wake your daughter."" Other information about what to wear was useful, but could be found online. I found this book really outdated and returned it right away."
3,"Good etiquette advice, but otherwise impractical","I purchased this book for my mother shortly after my engagement. The book is well-written and easy to navigate and read. For what it is and the price, it is a decent purchase.What this book does right is etiquette. It has great advice to make sure that you stay on Emily Post's good side without becoming too overwhelmed with all the wedding morays.What this book does poorly is assume you're throwing a $50,000 fete and that all your friends are dying to be your assistants. It's advice about the affair-itself can be a bit overblown.If you're having a very high-end function or are a person of means, please consult this book until the binding tears. But, if you, like me, are having an elegant event on a realistic budget with friends who have realistic schedules, then this book will be underused."
4,3rd Birthday Dora Tent,I bought this for my 3 year old twins and they love it. Their kitchen is in their w/ their blankets & pillows and they have a blast in it. It was easy to pop open and put together..we can't get them out of it
3,Playhut Dora review,"It is not very durable, the seams on the inside are coming undone exposing the metal."
2,"huge, flimsy and impossible to store","I got this playhut for my daughter last xmas. It now sits, hopefully forgotten, in the garage. Here were my concerns: First of all, it's huge--way bigger (taller) than a Dora fan (i.e. a 3 or 4 yo) will need. Secondly, it's absolutely impossible to fold small enough to put away. Folding it that small also destroys the rods that support the ""structure"" so instead, it leaned against the wall, huge and ugly. I dreaded getting the thing out because it took up half the living room. Third, it's really flimsy--just a shell, really -- and would collapse after a few minutes of exhuberant play. After a month or so, it started ripping and falling apart at the seams. Not worth the money in my view."
3,Fun that you can never put away,"My daughter is 3 years old and we received this tent for Christmas last year. She enjoys playing with it on a daily basis, but we can never put it away. The tent itself is very durable, but the door never stays on. We hardly ever bring it out anymore because of its size and the fact that we can not put it away. I would not buy this tent again."
3,Does not fold,"Its beautiful, attractive and Kids do enjoy it. But real problem starts when you want to fold it down. Either instructions are not very clear or It does not work the way its shown/describe in the instructions."
1,"Terrible product, keeps collapsing","This is a really terrible product. It will not stay up and stable and keeps collapsing on itself. I read the instructions to see if I was missing something and it said that some versions of this product come with a support pole and some do not. Mine didn't and the thing won't stand up. It's also nearly impossible to fold it back into the size of the box it came in.I have fiddled and fiddled with trying (following the directions) to twist some of the wires in a certain way to try to get it to be a little more stable, to no avail.I really wish I still had the receipt for this thing so I could return it, but unfortunately I didn't keep it, so the next destination is...the trash."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this tent for my great granddaughter's 4th birthday. After setting it up for her to see, we could not get it to fold correctly. The directions are impossible to follow. As a result, the tent now does not stand upright after being folded. There is no way to contact the manufacturer or get any other help with folding the tent. I feel quite foolish for having bought it."
4,"Big fun, but be aware!!!!!","When my three year old daughter came home and saw this set up, she was so excited!!! We spend a lot of time in this tent, and it is great for developing imaginations. I also like the fact that it is so easy to put up (took about 5 minutes the first time), and can also be easily folded up and put in the small duffle bag, which is included. However, there are a couple of issues with the way this tent is made. First, the hinged door doesn't fasten to the other side of the tent perfectly; I don't think it was sized correctly to do so. Secondly, after a week of play, some of the stiching is starting to come out of the tent, exposing the plastic ""foundation"" of the tent. Still, it is a great buy, especially considering plastic playhouses are upwards of $200 and more. An overall good buy, as long as the buyer is aware that it will probably only last six months to a year."
5,great tent but................,"I love this dora tent.Lots of room and you can even have a slumber night in it.So if you plan on putting it up,leave it up and don't fold it down.It won't work! So i leave mine up.The only thing i can complain about is my cat and kitten.They jump on the roof and make the tent colapse.They must do this about 20 times a day.They hunt eachother through it and is driving me crazy.The kids think it is great.I think they should make these tents pet proof!! LOL!"
3,This thing is HUGE,"I bought this for my daughter at Christmas; admittedly I was too unfocused to really see the dimensions of this playhut - this thing is so big I can stand up in it. After only a couple of months of limited play, it doesn't seem to stand up very straight and the roof sags over the door noticeably. We're moving to a new house and I'm hoping to sneak a smaller play hut in its place."
1,Dora Explore Mega Tree House - I am returning it,"My kids absolutely love it, but my 4 year old daughter was heartbroken when I told we have to take it back. The folding is impossible. I have a nanny who worked with many playhut products and said they are really easy to fold once you know how. Well, we spent 45 minutes (not to mention the time I already wasted) trying to fold it and failed.As I have seen on another review. If you can leave this up the entire time, it is great. If you plan to store it, it is impossible. Unfortunately, I will be returning it tomorrow."
5,Shout Out,"I'd just like to use this space to give a shout out to the big three. And, uhh, yeah that's it."
1,Be very cautious...,"Being an MD, I would caution readers to be careful in forming some of the opinions posted in reviews. You might want to visit [...] for reference. I can say I personally am not influenced or swayed by drug companies or money, etc that was mentioned in a review. I also do not base a diagnosis on ""prejudices"". It's hard to not interpret a positive HIV screen, followed by a positive Western blot, along with a low CD-4 and high viral load as anything but what it is. As for the deaths only resulting from the medications in one review...why did all those AIDS patients die in early years BEFORE we had any treatments??? If no modern medical treatments are needed, why do these patients bother going to the doctor when all else fails? One last piece of advice....the 11th hour is not the time to suddenly find faith in the evil healthcare system and expect a miraculous outcome."
1,"Stop the Myth, this is Killing People","Please visit the AIDS question and answer section of the Johns Hopkins website.Please realize that it is human nature to deny what we do not want to accept.PLease realize that HIV can be treated and one's life greatly extended, and that the meds get better all the time.Please know that the earth is not flat, and that HIV causes AIDS is not now, nor ever will be, a question, an opinion or anything else other than fact. Silence=death. We've come so far, let us never go back."
4,Rip away the assumptions...,"Christine does a wonderful job asking the tough questions and wrestling with the answers. Though no single book or piece of literature should make up your entire argument, Christine makes a fairly strong case for a revisal of the HIV/AIDS death connection. A highly important read!"
3,Before you throw away the condoms......,"I do not know how much of this book is true, false, incomplete or misleading, but even if everything Maggiore says is true, we are not out of the woods yet. We still need condoms because o syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis b and c and chlamidia and the other STDs out there."
1,The Author's 3 Year Old Daughter Died of Aids-Related Pneumonia,"The only ""science"" in this book is what I call pick-and-choose-science. You present a meaningless bunch of theories that don't withstand scientific testing or even the mildest level of scrutiny.Christine Maggiore should be criminally charged for negligent homicide in the death of her daughter - a 3 year old toddler who needed her mother's love to rate higher than her mother's denial. Even in death, Eliza Jane's mother remains steadfastly convinced that HIV does not cause AIDS - yet the child was HIV positive and died from AIDS-related pneumonia. Thankfully, Ms. Maggiore has reached the age where she cannot produce more human beings whose only purpose will be to die horrible deaths over their mother's ignorance.Christine Maggiore is incapable of acknowledging that this book is a farce - even after the death of her own daughter. How many more innocent children have to die at the hands of obstinate parents too full of pride to save them?"
1,Deadly Wrong,"The LA County Coroner reported the writer's daughter died of AIDS-related pneumonia a few months ago. This book details the ignorant, dogmatic conspiratorial fallacy that HIV is harmless.In death, the writer's daughter, Eliza Jane Scovill, has probably written the best critique of this book: deadly wrong."
1,This woman is insane,"How gullible are you people? You actually believe this woman. She has no qualifications to prove this. When there are people out there with several PH.D's who can prove to you that HIV causes AIDS. So who are you going to trust. The woman with barely any education or the Ivy league university graduates with several PH.Ds and almost 20 years of research under their belts. She makes me think of those people who still think the world is flat even or the Holocaust didn't happen. She'll learn her lesson soon when her husband gets HIV or her kids do. I'll tell you why people believe this insane woman. You want closure because you've just been given a natural death sentence. So you believe anyone, even this insane woman."
5,Scary,This book really scared me. It tought me to not accept gifts from stangers. The part at the end was really awesome. Read this book if you like a good mystery.
5,Suspense Masterpiece!,"I read this book as an early teen and loved the characters, the plot and the suspense. It was terrifying without being cornball, sympathetic to the characters, and written on a level that children could understand and adults could still enjoy. The mythological undertones of Father Baart and Lucifer are spine-chilling. I love this book, and it got me hooked on the series. I actually find them more enjoyable than Harry Potter. Happy reading!!"
4,Nevermind the Potter...,"...here comes Johnny Dixon. Although I can't help but notice the new cover depicts him as sort of a blonde version of Harry. I always liked the old Edward Gorey cover better. At any rate, 11 years after I read them (I'm now 24) Bellairs' first few books for children are priceless: scary, funny, and filled with lovely little historical details.Eventually, Bellairs' books became too formulaic, but I liked BLUE FIGURINE, as well as the follow-ups: THE MUMMY THE WILL, AND THE CRYPT, SPELL OF THE SORCERER'S SKULL, REVENGE OF THE WIZARD'S GHOST, and THE TROLLEY TO YESTERDAY. Great for kids too young for Stephen King."
3,Bits and Echoes of the Past,"Ok, ""52 Week High"" is not going to really bring back the good old days, but the band [...] sure tries to recreate the late `60s West Coast vibe that still ripples across the land. This is a clever collection of sometimes loose-knit songs, played with verve (if not always technical perfection). There is a lit bit of everything here and echoes of Quicksilver, The Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and myriad others infuse the soul of this recording. The lead vocals are a bit flat in spots, and sometimes the musical meanderings cause me to hit the skip button depending on my mood. Still a solid effort worth checking out from one of those bands that no doubt sounds better live than in the studio."
1,Not worth the money,"My door is loose in the jamb. The heavy duty rubberized seal is shredding, and a newspaper fixit column recommeded this product. It is as thin and flimsy as it looks. I'm probably going to try applying a square spongy seal and putting this on top - but it's by no means optimal. Don't waste your money."
2,Where did it go?,After hearing the first track I thought this CD was a must buy....then I hit the rest of the tracks...not sure what happened but this CD takes a quick and bad downward turn. Buy it cheap for the first track or get the single other than that this is a waste of space in your CD storage shelf.
2,Only if the shoe fits!,"If you have a wardrobe of flats or Keds-type sneakers this is a great storage unit. Owners of boots, heels, or anything the least bit bulky beware!I have this type cabinet and I'm about to donate it to charity. It only accepts about a third of my shoes. If you look closely at the picture the heels seem to stick out. My heels do, and the unit won't shut with them in there! So it stays open constantly. At first I thought I would'nt mind, but I'm tired of looking at it like this."
4,Cute little book :),"There are only a few lines for every two-page spread, so this one is perfect for babies and toddlers.Even the little ones can join in the game of looking for the blown-away hat in every picture (and since the hat is the goose's final destination you're helping them learn some narrative convention, too!)However, because this book is really best suited for the smallest children, it may be a good idea to just get the board book version instead. It's the same book, not abridged or anything."
5,our chin gets so excited,"when our chin sees this coming, she gets soooo excited! she LOVES every bite! great price and fast delivery. will continue to purchase...wish it had bigger bag"
5,My kids love this book!,"This book is gorgeous! Trisha Howell did a wonderful job, writing a short meaningful children's story about a melon and a turnip that have to overcome obstacles to enjoy the good things in life. As a parent of 4 children, I see that some of my children are stimulated via sight; therefore I recommend books like this to parents who wish to teach empowering ideas to their children.And by the way, the quality of this book is super. You should buy it just for the art!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works"
1,"Reading this was indeed a ""long journey""","Having been a great fan of the Spanish Bit series by this author, I began this book with great anticipation. I rarely set a book aside unfinished but after slogging through about half of this one, I closed it and put it on the shelf. Coldsmith's talent lies in the historical fiction like that of the Spanish Bit saga. Those are outstanding. This was not worth my time."
2,"GREAT MUSIC, poor interpretation","Well, well... a Great Music indeed, extremely tragic and elegiac but... what a hurried and superficial interpretation by Mr.Howard! ""Nuages gris"" (I LOVE Marc-André Hamelin's one!) is very simple to play but paradoxically more difficult than ""Mephisto-Valzer"". It's not a matter of technical difficulties of course, but more ""artistic"" one. Howard simply doesn't know to sink in the deep darkness of Liszt late, gloomy masterpieces. I can't hear distress or hopless in that interpretation, it's just a plain reading, with almost no soul.Looking at the duration of the present CD (79:41 min) I could think that such hurry is only to make 1 CD instead of 2. What a pity...Mister Howard's incredible task (and courage) is really admirable (musicological one is astonishing!), but Liszt is not only supersonic octaves!"
4,"nice for a reading chair, not good as computer foot rest","This is a nice foot rest for a fairly straight-backed reading chair. And it is nice because you can flip it upside down and then have a surface to put something down, like a beverage. I had bought it hoping to use it as a computer foot rest, and in that capacity, it was technically possible to use it, but it absolutely killed my back."
5,I never heard anything like it!,"This is one of the best Christmas CDs I ever heard (from all genres). Just look at the ratings, its unanimous!This man has set himself apart from the pack. This music is very refreshing. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT becuase you can listen to it throughout the year and its for all ages too."
5,A Timeless Christmas from Amazon.com,Israel Houghton's music is blessed beyond words! His gospel and this digital Christmas CD is a celebration of songs that you will keep on repeat even after the Holidays. 'Hark' The Harold Angels Sing is one of my FAVs! This cd doesn't dissapoint! Be blessed.
3,A man and his cat,"""A Kitten for Christmas"" is not, per se, a Christmas story in that, although the cat in question, Minna, arrives on Christmas day, the focus of the book is on the cat's life, and obviously the majority of that life occurs on days other than Christmas. So those drawn to the book by its title and hoping for a Christmas book should look elsewhere.Author Briant is convalescing at home when he receives the gift of a Siamese kitten, to which he is immediately drawn. Thus begins a relationship that includes trips to the park so that the cats (along with Minna is her brother) can experience nature, multiple trips to a breeder to impregnate Minna, and a few escapades involving hiding cats.I found the book to be surprisingly empty. It is clear the author adored his cats, but I never had the sense of a bond like that described inA Cat Named Darwin: Embracing the Bond Between Man and Petor, to cite another British cat, A Lion Called Christian."

2,Only for low-traffic areas,"I got the camera and installed it in 2 minutes. It definitely writes images to the SD card. The image is very clear. However, it saves one picture per second! That means it will fill up any card quickly. Even more, it saves all images to only one folder, and I found it limited to 10,000 images, which means 2 hours and 45 minutes only. Even worse, it doesn't save any timestamp on the pictures, so there's no way to tell when they were taken.A good idea, but poorly implemented. If you could change the picture delay to 3 or 5 seconds, and include a timestamp, this would be a winner."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","Bought the unit thinking it was a good idea which it is. Stand alone unit only needs power and saves all the images to an SD card.The bad:- only accepts up to 1 gb SD card. It takes too many pictures and will fill up the memory card in no time.- battery only lasts 3-8 hours. So you would have to check on it often.- Poor camera if object is in motion. Images are a blur, only very still items are in good quality.- SD card sticks out of side. Anyone can see it, and supect it and also take the SD card!! should have been located in the back out of sight.- price is a bit high for such a poor quality item. might as well invest in a real camera system.- indoor only. plastic construction feels flimsy."
3,Works okay but quality is poor,"The picture quality from this motion activated camera is very poor and the overall quality is low which makes it not as cheap as it appears. However, it works as advertised."
1,Macintosh no way!,"Bought it, fired it up. Very excited to use it! But no way will it work on Macintosh. Unable to find any images on SD card even with data recovery software. Don't get sucked in Macintosh users!!! The product info does not tell you it won't work on Macintosh. You have to buy it like I did and then call customer support. No sympathy from them..., You are stuck! You would think it should work? All digital cameras work famously with Macs. Well, I found one that doesn't!!!!"
3,The Devil didnt do it,We had a heck of a time getting the floor attachment on the unit and no help from the seller who after a long time finally emailed us that we had to contact the makers about the product.I finally was able to get the floor attachment on the sweeper by slamming the heel of my hand on it. But now it won't come off and when we use it as a hand vac we have to use it with the wide floor attachment on it.
5,Nietzsche Introduction,"If you are new to Nietzsche/philosophy, or just want a secondary text that is very direct in its presentation, I highly recommend this book. While not as lengthy or note filled as Kaufmann or some others, it's also not as dry or labored. The authors set out to explain some of Nietzsche's major themes to the casual reader, writing in a straight forward way that encourages understanding. They are successful.This is not a biography of Nietzsche, but a study of his themes, imagery, style, and particular works, along with a debunking of some of the gossip that surrounds his name. It is obvious that the authors have spent a great deal of time studying Nietzsche, and this book reads with the confidence of someone who knows what they are talking about, and knows how to effectively share this with others."
1,A waste of time for serious philosophers,"This book is yet another work that is aimed at laymen with little or no philosophic knowledge. It comprimises Nietzsche's intensity, intent, and true form in every way possible. It tries to present a Nietzsche that is politically correct and fashionable that fits in with our current values and ideals. Unfortunately anybody who has really ever read Nietzsche knows that he was far from the kind of idea human being that our age likes to glorify. Nietzsche diagnosed his age as weak and decadent and probably would be even more harsh on our times. You can't make Nietzsche to be anything you want him to. He had definite ideas and was opposed to the current trend of anti-war, pro-democracy, and egalitarian ideals of this age."
1,A proof of the ignorance of modern man..,"This book is yet another proof that modern human beings may have gained great technological advancements but have lost a great deal of philosophical depth or even commonsense. It's such a shame to see a brilliant artistic philosophy such as that of Nietzsche completely butchered my people who are either ignorant to not read of all of this works, or perhaps they have a interest in defaming Nietzsche. Even a child could read Nietzsche and come to a better of understanding of his philosophy than what this book presents."
1,Eh.,"Nietzsche has been one of the most, if not the most, debated philosopher of the post modern era. He has been blamed for more than his share of social unrest and dismissed for more than his share of insight. He is a complex mind with an even more complex body of work. ""What Nietzsche Really Said,"" is a glossed over, overly sympathetic and simplistic understanding of Nietzsche's complex social, metaphysical and political critiques. I would only recomend this book for a young teenager who has never heard of Nietzsche or philosophy. The book is an easy read, which is fortunate because one is able to read roughly two to three pages per minute (any longer would simply cause frustration). The book lacks real critical insight into some of Nietzsche's major points, which is most problematic considering his aphoristic style. This is not an achademic text and at the very best, could be put into ""Idiot's Guide to Nietzsche"" or ""Nietzsche for Dummies"" format."
2,what professors of philosophy do to philosophy,"This book aims to help readers understand Nietzsche but what it does is to make you hate philosophy, or at least philosophy professors. They kill the spirit with the arid letter of the law."
5,Good grooves,"I heard JBT on our local progressive radio station and liked some of the grooves. I was looking for some new music and gave Grand National a whirl. It's excellent. It's easy to call them a jam band, but the mix of influences, including blusey slide guitar, funky grooves, a little celtic beat with a few rap-sytle vocals mixed in for some songs is very nice. Add some thought provoking lyrics and I love the combo. Now I'm jut deciding which JBT album to buy next.Also, after listening to the disc for about a month, I was able to catch JBT live and whoa, they were awesome! Those 3 guys put out some serious sound. If you get a chance, don't pass it up."
4,Butler can barely be beat!,"I simply cannot get enough of this trio. They are so mellow, yet the songs are both intellectual and political. Their lyrics speak volumes with only a few words. I await any new release of theirs."
1,Garbage,"How does anyone like this? It is complete trash...I honestly felt sick after listening to it. If you like garbage, then this is the album for you, if you like music with substance then run away from this album as far as your legs can take you."
4,Good Book,"The book is written in an ""all tribes"" type format and has a simple easy to understand approach. Anyone may pick up this book with no prior knowledge and get alot from it, others who may be more knowledgeable or tribe specific may find it somewhat simplified. In any case it is a very well done book with good solid approaches to incorporating Native American Medicine Wheel teachings into your daily life."
4,Funny and thorough,The quotations in this book range from the supportive to the philosophical to the hilarious to the critical. I enjoyed the diversity of the quotations. There are enough good ones to make you laugh and enough great ones to make you think. Teresa Theophano did a good job with her selections and arrangements.
2,Fair at best,"Pairing was easy, but it seems like every time I try to turn on the device, it's not connecting automatically to my phone. This is not the same trouble that I have had with a plantroics devise. The most dissappointing feature is the mute function. It works well, but there is a set of beeps to alert you that you are in mute mode. Generally that is good, however, the beeps are loud, the beeps happen about every 5 seconds, and lasts about 3/4 a second, and during that time you can no longer hear the call. So, about 20% of the call you are listing to will be covered up by the mute beeps. That's horrible when you are driving and you need to pay attention to a buisness call and want to avoid having them hear your driving background noise. Further, there has to be a close line of site from the devise to the phone, else static can be bad. If I hold the phone behind my back, the static is too much to continue. I am really dissappointed in this devise."
5,melting and emotion filled romance,this book reminded me of judith mcnaught's style of writing in which the focus is not solely on the romance alone but also the ties of family and friendship. it explores one girl's development from a child to a woman while trying to discover a sense of who she has become. awesome.
5,"The first in the ""Me Not"" series","I loved this book, from start to finish. One of my very favorite scenes in any of the romance books I've read in the past year & a half is in this book -- the balcony scene! It is not to be missed, it is that good. I laughed so hard, I thought I'd break a rib.This book is great by itself, though it excellently sets the stage for the next 2 in the series.1-10 scale: 9.9"
5,Crayola Metallix FX Crayons,"My girls love to color, these are fun and different. Will provide hours of quiet, creative activity!They are the same quality one would expect from crayola!"
5,Just great jerky,"Excellent book for me as I am just getting started in making jerky,very helpful information ,great book easy to follow recipes"
4,Impressed by the variety,"If you're just looking for simple regular beef or venison jerky, you can find dozens of recipes online. If you want more variety in meats (and even vegetarian) and flavors, this is a fun book to read with plenty of that, plus tips and history, and even recipes to make things out of the jerky you've got."
1,A disappointment,"If your weekend consists of loading your backpack with zucchini ""jerky"", strapping your $10,000 bicycle and custom fitted kayak on your $100,000 SUV, cranking up Jean Feraca on NPR and heading off to the trails with Biff and Muffy, you will love this book.Ordinary people will likely find it a bit pretentious and the recipes unpractical and unappetizing."
2,Somewhat disappointed,The information about the history of jerky was OK at the beginning of the book but didn't really add much in my opinion to what I wanted which is how to make it. Then after reviewing the recipes I really only found a few that I would be interested in making. Glad it didn't cost that much for the book through Amazon but if I would have had the chance to page through it at a bookstore would have most likely left it on the shelf. Can get about the same info for free on the internet.
1,bizarre,"i ordered a full-sized encompass mattress pad, and the one i received had orange/rust-colored stains on the bottom (bed side) of the pad. i would've just chalked it up to fate that the one i received was a bad pad, except for the comment above (from 2004). i wrote to amazon to ask about it. they apologized for the stained pad, but didn't attempt to explain any further. they immediately sent out a replacement. it arrived today, and has the same orange stains on the bottom of the pad. this one isn't nearly as bad though, and the stain is confined to a relatively small area. since i don't feel like going through the hassle of returning yet another one, i guess i'll just wash it and keep it. i've never had any problem like this with amazon before, but i've just bought books, DVDs, and music. guess i'll just stick with that."
3,Interesting book,The book has alot of period houses and interiors to look at. The picture detailing is great but the book lacks alot of instruction. What instruction it has is informative but is inconsistant. I only recommend this if you are very artistic and creative already and can figure out how to create these lovely houses.
2,Hoping for a good game,"But it is a very bad game. The story is barley there,you pick a hero/villian and fight 7 people. Thats about it, there is a little paragraph tellin you about your enemy like what he/she is doing and who they work for. The sound is decent pretty low quality but it is'nt completely terrible, the only saving grace is the graphics, while cool it doesnt save the game and, as much as i was hoping for a good game this one falls flat."
1,Terrible and Difficult,"Granted I'm not all that great at fighting games, but I can usually at least muddle my way through a few levels and squeeze some fun out of a game. This game wasn't what I expected at all. The controls are extremely clunky. You have to be in a particular spot to pick up an object, and it's way too easy to stand on top of it instead. Trying to pull off moves seems random at times, with the game favoring the enemy as far as timing goes.The story is nearly nonexistent. ""So-and-so is at the bridge, go stop him from damaging it."" Why even bother? And what's the point of unlocking characters if you don't get to choose who you can play as? It takes forever to fight one round, and you have to win 2 out of 3 to win the match.The only thing I found nice about the game was the graphics. It's a very nice looking game. But it wasn't enough to keep me playing for more than an hour."
1,Imperfect!,"The Good: play (if you don't get bored with it first) with all your favorite marvel super heroes.The Bad: Repetitive arenas (there are only 5)Choose a Marvel heroe, and you'll fight all the Imperfects, same order, same arena, same thing.Choose an Imperfect, and you'll fight all the Marvel heroes, same order, same arena, same thing.Card system that God knows what it does, and you can't even really choose your cards.Repetitive turns to boredom.Don't buy it trust me!"
2,Marvel Nemesis,"This is an excellent game for PSP, but compared to the excellent graphics and fun extras the home console games have, it stinks! The PSP version has a single player mode that gets very repetitive after a while, compared to the home console version that boasts a full, DIFFERENT storyline for each character. Also, the little gimmicks that make the home console multiplayer so great (funny intros, etc.) are missing comepletely! My advice would be to try this game on GameFly first, see if you like it, and then buy the home console version!"
4,Great EBM!,"The Small Print underneath the 3 arrows on my autographed hard copy says; A Collaboration Between Sebastian R. Komor and XP8! The back of the CD indicates that this was released in 2005. I love Sebastian Komor's work with ICON OF COIL, KOMOR KOMMANDO, Zombie Girl, Moonitor and Monofader! I also collect everything XP8 puts out. This cd is the 3rd XP8 studio release and the last album with original vocalist Paul Toohill. The music sounds like Hardcore minimal EBM. This disc will enhance any Nitzer Ebb Collection. If you like Nitzer Ebb, XP8, Icon Of Coil, Spetsnaz, Kloq, Fixmer/McCarthy, you'll Love This Disc! Take a listen, then add it to you're Ebm Collection!"
5,CD addiction,"I think I bought this CD two years ago. My brother got me into Nitzer Ebb when I was a teen, and I stumbled upon this CD on itunes when I was looking for music by the real Nitzer Ebb. I'm so glad I did. They took already good songs, updated them and kicked them up a notch. I listen to these songs in my ipod while running, listen to them in the car. I've become out of touch with popular music now because I can't stop listening to this CD and rarely turn on my radio. One of my coworkers heard me playing the music in my car and said he liked it. My boyfriend asked me who the band was, and my dad listened to it while changing the tires on my car and said he really liked it too. It's awesome."
2,Mediocre Tribute,"Nothing really new jumps out of this collection. If anything, this tribute album brings nothing to the table, lacking the original spark and fire of NE. The other reviewer is under the mistaken assumption that one of the members of NE is German but isn't. (They are British.)"
2,Pretty but too Delitcate,"I bought this item as a holiday gift. It is a very beautiful piece and is artisitcally designed well. When we went to set it in its stand, however, the lip of the neck brushed the wire frame and chipped! I was shocked that it broke so easily. It's possible that they connected at just the right point and it was mere coincidence, but I am not getting another one to find out. Beware!"
4,style and quality,I purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines. I have had no issues with the decanture being delicate. Infact we machine wash it after each use. The only issue I have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly. Other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture.
3,be very careful!!!,please be very gentle with this piece. I was trying to put it together and a piece chipped off. other than that it looks nice.
1,Obsolete: this book covers 1D0-410 not 1D0-510,"The 1D0-410 has been retired, and replaced with the 1D0-410. As far as I can tell, no books exist for the 1D0-510."
1,Pitiful Handling by Golfsmith,"Never received the correct driver although two were sent. The first one was in deplorable shape. The second driver was in decent condition but it was also the wrong driver.I sent the two drivers back and ""settled"" on a putter which I really did not want.No more dealings with Golfsmith for me."
2,Too clinical for my taste,"I'm not much taken by this CD. The five pieces all sound very similar and may work well in their original religious setting, assuming a the listeners' physical participation in the chant and rhythmic movements. But taken out of this context, reduced to the electronic medium of a CD, the music looses its impact on the listener."
4,"""You want a world of slaves...""","Only One Too by Jewel contains remixes of her song which can be found on Goodbye Alice in Wonderland. Only One Too is a song that is not my favorite on the studio album but I definitely enjoy the remxies. The Pull Club remix is my favorite in this collection. Jewel can sing any genre of song, her voice gives me goosebumps. Hot remixes from a so-so kind of rock song."
1,Glad I didn't write a review when I actually read it,"I would have rated in 5 stars for the quality of the story, but now that I know the majority of it has elements of untruth, it gets one star, and only because I can't rate it any lower. He also left out a lot of things, like at least one marriage. How do you forget THAT?Based on the things that came out later, he probably should have been IN Riker's Island, not running it. He sounds like someone who gets promoted because nobody likes them and there isn't enough on them to get them fired."
1,"CORRECTION, ZERO Stars For This One!","You can tell by the reviews that only friends of the former commish bought this book. Although it is interesting, the man in this book doesn't exist. Sufficed to say...many of us know better. This is Kerik viewed through his own eyes. Not the eyes of others. I thought Bo Dietl's book was the ultimate in self worship...I was wrong. If you're in the market for purely laughable fiction this is the book for you."
5,NEW YORK'S BRAVEST!,"I enjoyed reading about Bernard B. Kerik. He is a amazing personwho has done so much for New York City. When I first startedseeing him was on tv,when the awful day of September 11, 2001 happened. When I saw him on tv, I was amazed on how he could go thru those long hours of a day in press conferences and be inthe middle of the tragedy. When I read about his childhood, I was proud on how he handled his life. It's so amazing how he ended up being the person he is today. I hope Barnard Kerik in the future writes a second book about his life and tells more about his family. I also learned that cops are our hero's and they need more credit for what they do for us. They protect usand some die for us."
4,Inspiring autobio that kept me reading!,"Bernie Kerik's autobiography is a story of a role model who has refused to let himself become victimized by his tormented past and turbulent family history. He isn't the best writer in the world, but he knows how to tell a story--namely his own--with captivating detail and emotion. He tells his story with both toughness and compassion, the same traits that saved him during his neglected childhood and rocky adulthood. By the end of the book (before the epilogue, which relates his perspective of the events of September 11 in harrowing detail), I felt happy for him that he had learned to reconcile his troubled emotions over his past with maturity, dignity, and bravery.If this book has a weak point (other than at-times inconsistently-toned writing), it is that he sometimes indulges in tooting his own horn a little too often. Given his accomplishments, though, I can forgive this by saying, good for him--we need more role models in our society like him!"
5,WISH THERE COULD BE A SECOND BOOK....,"I TOTALLY ENJOYED READING THIS FASANATING BOOK BY BERNARD KERIK. IT ESPECIALLY HIT HOME AS I GREW UP IN THE PASSAIC/CLIFTON AREA AND MY FATHER IS A RETIRED PASSAIC FIRE FIGHTER. IT WAS SO INSPIRING TO READ WHAT OBSTACLES MR KERIK HAD TO OVERCOME AND SEE HIM DEVELP INTO SUCH AN OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL AND WITH SUCH A HUMBLE ATTITUDE. nO MATTER THERE FAULTS, HE HAS CERTAINLY INHERITED THE BEST QUALITIES OF HIS MOTHER AND FATHER!"
4,Great book,The Lost Son by Bernie Kerik is a fantastic book with loads of insight and excitement. This book has a great plot explaining the story of a man that struggled from the bottom until he chose to work for the NYPD. Bernie Kerik's book is a tell all story of a man who worked his way through the ranks of the NYPD until being appointed Commissioner of the NYPD. This book provides great insight into the personal and professional world of a great leader. I would highly reccomend this book to any current or aspiring Police Officers or managers or anyone else that would like to inprove there leadership skills.
5,The best book I have read in years...,"I loved this book-a story that demonstrates that it's not where you come from but how you use your unique talents. Mr. Kerik proves that you have to love what you do to achieve extraordinary things. He didn't care about the money, only that he loved his work. He also demanded excellence of himself and those around him and accomplished more in a few years than others do in a lifetime. There are so many great lessons in this book. I will look forward to seeing what Mr. Kerik does next. Something tells me that his best is yet to come. If your career is just kind of dragging along, awash in mediocrity, you better buy this book. If Kerik's intensity doesn't fire you up-you better check your pulse!"
1,SO ANGRY,"So I bought these rotors from Amazon, which I figured should be fine because almost every purchase from Amazon is good. Not so much with this one. These rotors are NOT slotted as seen in the sample picture. That's a big deal. The bigger deal is they didn't fit my 2007 Sonata. Not even close. Of course... you don't find this out until you rip your old rotor and brakes off, essentially decommissioning your car until you can buy a replacement.I'm not sure who dropped the ball here but THANKS! I've got my car on jack stands until I can order rotors local. At least they arrive next day to the store so I'm only out a car for a day."
2,"Cute, but not durable and practical","The clothes were cute as can be and once on the doll fit well. It was getting the clothes on that became a chore for me, the parent rather than the child. Also, a child doesn't know that to pull on the clothing to get them on can cause them damage, which we have since found out."
3,70-s nostalgia,"very good- life-affirming, sunday-morning, i love-everybody music. you can dance to it, think to it, love to it; puts you in a good mood, kids love it too. was very hip among progressive students back in 70-s guess where? - Soviet Union."
3,title mix up,"This CD IS NOT the one popular in former soviet union. The later has the same title, byt is mainly wind instruments like oboe.. This cd is street organ only, and the music is not very fluid."
2,NOT SPICY WORLD GHEE,"I opened this and to my surprise it was not the Spicy World Ghee as advertised here, instead I received ""JOY"" brand ghee made in the US not in India.Total Misrepresentation of the product as advertised"
1,You will not receive Spicy World brand ghee. You will receive Joy brand.,There is no food safety seal on the product. I haven't tasted it yet to review if it has a good taste. But I get worried eating products that don't have the tamper proof containers. I felt very annoyed when the box was opened and the different product was inside.
3,Good product but not what I expected,"I also received 'Joy' brand instead of 'Spicy World' that is described. What I got tastes good, and it is the first Ghee I ever bought, but someone expecting the product from India might be disappointed."
3,my introduction to ghee,"I decided to look for an inexpensive ghee to avoid the time and care needed to make my own. Though the outside of my box had a grease stain, my jar of taped and bubblewrapped ghee was intact. I find this jar to require salt and the texture to be grainy. It has a nice flavor but not the nutty overly buttery flavor I anticipated."
5,Great recipes...,"Another reviewer panned this book b/c she bought it simply to ""know Padma better."" This is a cookbook, not a biography. The recipes are delicious, low in cholesterol and low-fat. They are easy to make and the instructions are clear, so the book is accessible to new cooks but still interesting for those with more experience in the kitchen. I think this is a terrific book, the recipes I've used have all been delicious (especially the Spinach and Garbanzo Tapas). I highly recommend it."
2,Not as bad as some people think it is,"This isn't a bad cookbook but it isn't the greatest one either, if you don't buy it you're not missing out on anything except the pictures of Padma. The recipes aren't that difficult and the Indian ones which are her specialty are the best in the book. For people who aren't the best cooks but want to make some decent Indian dishes, Padma's book is pretty good for that. If I had a dollar for every time she mentions Daniel and her mom, I would be a millionaire...and I could have done without the narratives that are so shallow that you know that they came from the mind of a model. For example, ""there I was in a beautiful Chanel gown eating a tuna fish sandwich."" Someone please tell Padma her village called, apparently their model is missing. One more thing, all her recipes are available on the food network website FOR FREE."
4,A different sort of cookbook,"Pretty exotic stuff - I was looking for different recipes for couscous (was taking a trip to Sicily) at the same time, and Padma had several! She really covers a broad range of ethnic cuisines.It would be helpful if you lived near a major metro area to obtain some of the ingredients."
2,"Well, at least it was better than FF vol. 1","Well, I totally hated vol. 1, it was so stupid. This one was much better. It told more about the plot and it had a lot more action than vol. 1. I still thought the characters were too goofy and the animation could of been a little better."
4,FF2 is cool....,"i like FF2. the game and movie are cool. i like the art in this movi, and the story goes with the game. if you have any question please e-mail me at fick300@hotmail.com"
2,A real let down.,A Final Fantasy fan would like it. But TRUE anime fans will agree with me on this because it has less suspence than Vol. 1. It kills the suspence that Vol. 1 was trying to build.
1,Homophobic Garbage by a Bigoted Author,"It is amazing the extent this author went to in trying to portray the early male bodybuilding champions as ""normal"" heterosexuals, while excluding the ""fringe"" elements of homosexuals. This book should be viewed as one bigot's attempt to rewrite the facts of history to fit her own purposes and bigoted viewpoint. Don't waste your money!"
1,homophobic garbage,Amazing that this level of garbage could be published in the modern day. Weak and uninformed. Not worth the price of a used copy.
1,"old fashioned, reactionary, bigoted","Long diatribe explaining how heterosexul the bodybuilders of Muscle Beach were. Sure, she admits, there were a few ""fringe"" elements swayed by the porno-peddlars to pose semi-nude for the edification of perverts, but most of the bodybuilders were ""normal"" (her words)and got married! In the year 2002, must we still be subjected to such homophobic garbage? Hey, maybe the ""homosexuals"" were normal too?"
2,not white,"Picture shows product as pure white, but there are yellow beads mixed in there. Still pretty, but I had to return it since yellow beads don't typically go with white wedding gowns."
5,Laundry Balls,"These are the best. Not only do you save money on laundry detergent, which most people use way too much of, but the clothes come clean and fresh."
5,these are the BEST,"you save water, your clothes, lugging detergent, filling landfills and your clothes come out great. I'll never use anything else. Great for travel too."
3,Laundry Ball washer action,These do not last long. They seemed to work OK. I added detergent with my wash load as well. Good product.
4,PRACTICAL HELP FOR SPECIAL NEEDS,This books offers practical and clear guidance for those looking for answers to specific doubts. Quick reference and clear layout prevent the reader to waste time. A good choice for intermediate and advanced students of English as a second language. It deserves to be taken into account together with other important works of reference.
4,bravo,"Several distinguished artists have recorded the complete Op. 87--among them Nikolayeva (3 times), Jarrett, and Ashkenazy. Richter has recorded about half of them and his readings are available on various CDs. Each of these artists has something important to say. It is easy to snipe and find fault. It is harder to listen attentively and accept each interpretation on its own terms. These pianists are the best the 20th century has produced. Who are we to sit in judgment of them? How many of us can play the piano? How many of us have studied--really studied--the scores? My suggestion is that we stop trying to show how smart we are and how many recordings we have heard and instead learn humility in the face of the many forms of greatness."
3,Mediocre recording of excellent compositions,"Unfortunately while the music here is fascinating and charismatic, reminiscent of Bach at his contrapuntal best, the interpretation is not. There is neither the objectivity of a Bach purist nor the passion of a romantic at work here. It's not so much slow tempi that are at fault for this rather aimless, meandering approach; rather the general lack of coherent rhythmic drive undermines the playing, especially in transitions. Certain passages sound rhythmically uneven -- more akin to tentative student playing than to the considered studio sessions of a professional pianist with years of experience and perspective. This is not to say that the playing lacks charm or polish, merely that these issues, and a general muddiness and ambivalence that deflates larger musical structures, leave one with the feeling that the music has not been played to its potential. This is a competent recording that can only leave you wishing for something more inspired."
2,Seems interesting but format is weird for reading,"I would not really recommend this book, as it is a workbook associated with some sort of training. Hence, it is not really well written, for those of us with little time to sort things out. That's my main objection. The information seems pretty good, but too terse for someone wanting a rounded presentation."
1,The battery doesn't fit all the phone models on its list,"Bought this replacement battery along with my Nokia N80 2 years ago.I recently wanted to replace the battery in my phone and discovered this battery doesn't fit it at all (it's about 4 mm too long).Thankfully I didn't lose much money in the deal, but it sure would be nice if they took the N80 off the model list, so others don't make the same ""mistake"".Beth"
2,Not quite what I expected,"Pros:It's waterproofCons:1. Brush is way too big2. Smelled different...not sure if it's because it was old or if it always smells that way3. Clumped4. Seemed a bit too dryI bought this mascara based on all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't like it. I'll give it another shot or two but if I still don't like it after 3 tries, it's going in the trash. I'm really picky about what products I buy & this is a perfect example of something that just doesn't live up to the great reviews."
5,Most bang for the buck!,"Panasonic - the only telephones worth spending any money on - does it again with a twist. This set of phones, one with a base and two additional handsets, is perfect for a multi-level home with limited telephone jacks. The intercom feature is awesome. Too many wonderful features to describe, read the description. This system rocks. You won't be disappointed, I'm not."
1,"Good features, poor audio","The most important feature of a phone is audio, and this phone falls on it's face on that one. My first comment when I made a call was that this was the worst sounding phone I'd ever picked up. It's got a tiny little speaker, and although the audio is crystal clear, the tonal quality is very poor in my opinion.The phone has got ""Voice Enhancer."" I've never had a phone that needed voice enhancement. The engineers knew this phone needed it. Only if they were competant enough to design in decent audio, they would have done that in the first place. They screwed up the audio and turned it over to marketing. The marketing people put in that button, and trust me, it's purely placebo and marketing fluff."
1,"Never another Panasonic phone, ever!",We bought the three handset system and the speakers started failing after about eight months and now the microphones are starting to fail.It would have been nice if the handset buttons lit up but I'd be happy if I could buy a cordless phone that lasts more than a few days past the warrantee period.
2,Need to yell or talk very loud for people to hear you!,"I think the main phone that is attached to the phone jack is the only one that works correctly. When using 2nd or 3rd phone people always say I CAN""T HEAR YOU, SPEAK UP, so I have to just about yell so they can hear me and always end up going to the main phone to carry on a converation.Everything else about the phone is good, however I am thinking about taking this $130 phone back...."
4,CORDLESS BUT ALSO LIGHTLESS,"NICE PHONES, BUT IF YOU ARE IN A DARK ROOM GOOD LUCK WITH TH BUTTONS. NO LIGHTS BACK LIGHTING THEM."
2,Starrphyre,"I am very disappointed with this telephone system. The answering machine does not notify you of a message by any sound--only a light flashes when you have a message. I bought the wrong one--I expected it to announce vocally who is calling. Even if you answer a call, it counts it as a missed the call. To clear that from all three phones, you have to run around the house and clear each handset one at a time."
2,Medicore Sound Quality;,Expected more from Panasonic? The message indicator light works randomly - replaced system once; appears that the phone has to hear the dial tone to understand the message has been retrieved (each individual hand set); Sound quality is poor on handset - often told people can't hear me and volume is at max.Ergonomics of it - love it; Do note that there is no information screen on the base unit - you can't see caller ID nor the number you are dialing - there jsut isnt' a screen - room for one? but they didn't put it in?
1,Don't bother,"Worked ok at first...The range was disappointing but they worked ok until the caller ID quit working just after the warantee expired. Today the base system died so now I am stuck with three worthless handsets and searching for a new phone system. It certainly won't be another Panasonic as this has been the worst phone system I have owned. For the price, it should last longer than a year and a half."
2,"Started out great, but after 2 months almost useless...","We purchased this phone set several months ago, and out of the box the sound quality and features were perfect. However, slowly over the course of 2 months the signal began to degrade and the ability to speak and listen clearly through all of the handsets degraded to an almost inaudible level.We tried to analyze this signal problem against the bandwidths of any other cordless devices in the house, but couldn't find another culprit.We have a great 900Mhz Panasonic that will probably never die, but from my persepctive and other frustrated owners that I know, the new generation seems less robust and prone to technical issues."
5,Vette62RCM,"This is a excellent phone with alot of features and ease of use. The paging feature is very handy and fun to page people from the next room or from 100 yards away. The ability to change the color of the flashing alert light on the antena for incoming calls and messages, along with assorted ring and melody selections makes for cool customizing on each hand set. The best feature is the phone book tranfering to the other hand sets, you only have to program your list into one hand set and send it simply to the other ones. This is our second Panasonic phone and I beleive they set the standard in cordless phones."
4,"So far, so good!","We now have a phone in every room!Sounds clear, feels good against the face and each handset is numbered so you don't mix them up. The range is good. I can walk atleast 200' away from my house and still have a signal! Could be more, never went any further.Only ""peeve"" is it keeps ALL phone calls listed on each handset and needs to be erased on each one as well. If you don't, one or all of your handsets will have 147 calls on it! Luckally, you can erase ALL calls with just 2 buttons pushed but you have to go around to each phone to do it.My favorite feature is being able to call any one of the handsets in the house. Really comes in handy with kids! I just press in the Handset # belonging to the phone I want to call and I can get the kids attention without yelling! :-) (Much!)All in all, a good purchase and would recommend to others."
3,"Nice phone, but there could be improvements","It's an okay phone. The problem with it is that people at the other end cant hear well. I always have to speak loudly, which is not always possible with a sleeping baby.Also, when you create a phone book/phone list, you have to constanly transfer it to the other to phones. It does not automatically read what the other phone is doing.When you look at phone #1 one, and see that there are 4 missed called, and clear it, that does not clear the other phones. You have to erease from each phone."
2,After Six Months: Persistent Complaint,"I have had this phone for over six months and I agree with much positive that has been said. The sound that I hear when others speak if very strong, but over time I have had to change phones (to a non-cordless) countless times when people have said they could not hear me or that I should ""speak up."" When I do change phones, the response is that it is ""much better!"" I know that cordless and corded have different technologies, but one should not need to shout into a phone, ever. There are several settings on this Panasonic that make what I hear crisp, boosted, ""improved,"" but nothing to help others hear me (I speak to groups every day for my work and my voice is good). I am actually in the market for a replacement set of phones---and would greatly appreciate someone telling me of any cordless, Panasonic or other, that transmits a voice loud and clear."
4,As Advertised,"I've had this system for a month or so now and don't have any complaints. The sound is much better than any other cordless I've owned and the interface is more intuitive as well. There have been no cases of leed through or interference with my wireless network or other devices.This is a solid, top-notch system. Money well spent."
3,Does the Job,"The phone allows me to speak anywhere in my home without running wires. In fact, I use my phones via the internetwith only one connection and 3 phones. All of my phones notify me of special callers and missed messages without ever visiting the base. I have established my phone book with and can make calls without having to remember numbers. The only negatives are the phones do not have talking Caller ID and does not log dialed out calls."
5,Good Product,Great price from Amazon. Works very well from all rooms in the house. Good sound quality. No complaints whatsoever.
2,panasonic phones,"this is the second set of cordless panasonic phones i've purchased in a year. The handset ringers in all handsets stopped working within two weeks.Other than that the phones are great. These are used in a shop enviroment and it was suggested to me that perhaps the speakers panasonic uses are sensative to dust or magnetic fields (there are welders present).Whatever the case the older panasonic phones didn't have this problem, I had a set I bought in 1999 that had no failures other than a battery in four years."
2,Short Range,"If you use this phone more then 50-100ft, you may experience what I did, digital dropouts, and eventual termination of the call. Sort range was okay."
4,Panasonic cordless phone and answer machine,"I bought this system in November for our daughter and son-in-law. Based on their experience for 4 months, I bought one for our home also. The quality of the message recorder is much superior to our old one. I found it easy to load the numbers that we call frequently."
5,Long-lasting phone system,"After seeing some excellent reviews and some people with major problems, I'm compelled to say we've never had any trouble with this phone system. We've had the same 3 handsets for over 3 years now. The kids have beat them up in various ways - they've been thrown and dropped hundreds of times. We continue to have crystal-clear reception, no loss of battery life and no problems with the base.I'm starting to look for another set for a relative and am thinking of just getting the same thing even though the technology is a few years old now..."
4,Replacement Phone,"I purchase this phone for a replacement.Got tired of running to my corded phones. This one works fine for what I want it to do. Call waiting and caller Id is a good feature for when someone calls in while talking on the phonem you can view to see who is trying to call in. Speaker by all means works fine for me. Sometimes I need to record my calls. I just place my recorder near the speaker. There is one problem I have and that is in the basement of my home. One part of the basement is total concrete with no window, that is where I do not receive good reception, have to move away from that area and it works fine. The volume for hearing is good for people who have small hearing problems. Can page the phone for other person to pick up if the call is for them are to locate a phone.There are other features on the phone but I haven't tried them as yet.Overall I feel I have made a pretty good purchase for the money spent."
2,Volume Loss,"Have owned this unit for over a year. It does have great features...but recently after a 15 minute call I lose the volume from the caller and have to resort to a corded phone to continue the call. I have changed all the batteries to no avail. I too am looking for a quality replacement, if someone can suggest one."
4,This phone system works for me!!!,"After purchasing this particular phone system and using it for several months now, I feel that I made the appropriate purchase. Great quality for the money."
1,Not Happy,"Initially I was very happy with my phones. BUT a year later one handset would not ring, a year and a half later another handset will not display, leaving me with only one handset. I notice from other reviews this is a problem with this phone. Also I thought it was just me not talking loud enough but frequently people would say I can't hear you. Would NOT recommend this product."
5,Great Phone!,"I have had this phone for several months now, it is a great phone. It is easy to use and so nice to be able to put a phone wherever you want without the need of a phone jack."
3,"phone okay, answering not workign properly","decent quality, easy set up for phonesanswering does not work properly when it switches on after x ringshave not been able to figure out whether there is a time stamp for messages receivedoverall happy with purchase"
3,Good phone?,"I bought this phone because of the extra phone sets. The phone works fine, but I have to press another key to stop a call (I miss a one-key-function for call/stop on other Panasonic phones that I have).The phone is not cheap, but it looks cheap. There is not a clock on answering machine so a bit zero is on that small LCD window all the time. Poor design."
4,Great phone,"This phone is everything it claims to be. The only issue I have with it is that there are so many options, that I can't find the volume button. Guess I'll have to read the directions."
2,Product NOT as advertised,"This product was advertised as one that would show when you had a voice mail (not a message on its own answer machine). On the product description it clearly stated that you had to have the phone service for this (which I do) and it would show on each phone that a message was waiting. I even contaced Panasonic and all I ever got from them was that the phone did not show a voice mail message. They were missing the point, I found out that it did not show a voice mail, but they advertised that it did. They would never admit that their description was in error. I don't like to deal with companies that will not admit that they made an error. I would not recommend Panasonic products for that reason. I would say if you ever had a problem with the product they probably wouldn't admit it was a product fault. Thanks."
1,Phones are great at first but watch out!,"I purchased the 3 phones several months ago. I loved them. Then one day my sister-in-law dropped one of the phones and all of a sudden it didn't work. I tried replacing the battery, nothing looked broke it just wouldn't work. So have 2 working phones and they are almost 6 months old and almost everyday they stop working for some odd reason. I have to go and unplug the main phone with the answering machine in for a few minutes before the phones will work again. I give this one star because the phones are not holding up at all they cost over $100 when I originally bought them. Junk!"
5,Panasonic phone w/3 handsets and answering,"1. Excellent sound quality2. Excellent battery life (owned & still have Panasonic)3. Features for ring, color, and sound control4. Quality answering system & phone construction"
5,Panasonic 5.8 GHz Cordless phone/answering machine,"I really like this product; I have 4 handsets w/chargers scattered over the house--all they need is an electrical plugin and they work--without being wire-connected to the phone system. I have some other phones that are ""wired;"" this addition gives me phones in every room and 2 phones in the kitchen. It works very well."
4,Great Phone System,"The phone system is as we expected. It does not interfere at all with our wireless network. You can call one handset from another which is nice. And if you are feeling playful you can purchase and download ring tones that are really cute.The only negative thing we have found about it would be that the handsets do not really stand on their own, they fall over easily. And the buttons on the handsets do not light up.Other then that the phone system has been great. Clarity is great, setting up is easy, and with three phones for one physical phone line makes it easy to put the remote phones wherever you want to keep them."
2,Sound is terrible,"I got this phone to replace an old AT&T model, and chose it because the range is supposed to be great. The range may be great, but there's no good volume control, and people could barely hear me, and vice versa! The sound enhancement sounded strange and didn't help. I've since bought a Motorola, which, aside from its sleek looks, works great, and has great volume features"
3,Not exactly what I expected,I purchased this to use at our business. We have a lumber yard and would often need the phone out in the yard. This is a very nice phone system. It would be perfect for in a house. But when it comes to leaving the building where the cradle is its awful. We ended up buying a different commercial grade cordless phone. I really wanted to write this as a warning for anyone looking for a long range indoor/outdoor phone. keep shopping. We ended up paying alot more for the commercial grade phones but they are truely long range.
4,Happy with my KX-TG5633B,"After researching many phones for quite awhile, I decided on thePanasonic KX-TG5633B. I have only had this phone for about two months now, but I am very pleased with it. I rated this phone 4 Stars because this really good phone could be better. Some of the features that I would like to see added are; backlit buttons that come-on whenever the phone is picked-up, rings, or any button is pushed. The answering machine should have at least three to four seperate mailboxes instead of just one. This feature is really nice for families and my old phone had this feature. The last feature that I would like to see incorperated is a ""ringer-off"" switch (that shuts-off all handsets and the base) for when babies are sleeping, for night workers, or when you just don't want to hear the phone for the day."
5,Easy to use,I was shopping for a phone system that could meet and grow with my needs. I have had a phone system that worked for 14 years. It finaly failed and was no longer being produced. I was looking for a system that had many of the features that my Nextel system has but for my home. I ended up with the system from Panasonic. It has been very easy to set up and use. I would recomend this system for anyone who is need of three or more phones. I bought the set of three and have added 2 more phones to the system. I like that they have a speaker that is loud and clear. Also the set up on the computer web site is so easy. If you are looking into a new phone system please look at this phone.
5,Love this phone!,"This is a great cordless phone, you would expect nothing less from Panasonic. The clarity is excellent, there is no static interference and the battery life is very good. The 3 handsets are great and of course only one needs a phone jack so you can put them anywhere in the house.You can customize ring colors, ring tones, caller ID, all great features. You can import your phonebook and copy it to all handsets or just 1. You can listen to your messages from any handset as well as remotely.My only beef is pretty minor. If you get a call, it says ""missed call"" on all the phones. Other phones I have had would clear this message on all phones after you viewed it. With this model, you have to clear each individual phone. It is only annoying probably because I am used to it the other way but I can live with it. Clearing the message is very easy."
4,"Good, but not excellent","Pros:1. Good battery life2. Handset speaker3. Answering machine access from handset4. Ability to page people within the house5. No interference with wireless network (as opposed to 2.4 GHz phones). Actually, I did not have a problem with a 900 MHz phone, but those are out of fashion these days.Cons:1. The range is actually much worse than that of my old 900 MHz Sony2. Phone book has nothing in common with those of the cell phones, which makes it a bit difficult to get used to navigation techniques3. Paging always causes the destination handset to ring, even when its ringing is switched off4. There is no power backup option for the base, so during the power outage you cannot receive the calls and you lose the time settings."
1,"Crystal clear voice, No Way",New phone received today has voice quality that is so poor that recorded messages cannot be understood. Messages sound as though somebody is in the basement playing the messages on an old tape recorder that isn't working properly. My $25.00 cordless phone/answering machine works much better than this thing.This site also says this product comes with a belt clip. There was no belt clip in the box. I wanted a belt clip because I am stuck at home with a fractured arm and leg. I can't drive to the post office and am stuck with a phone that doesn't work. Maybe I got the bad one in the batch but I sure won't buy a Panasonic phone again!
1,don't buy it,We have had this less than a year and it does not work. You can not dial out or answer. It is a bust.
4,"Solid, reliable phone system","We have used this system as our primary home phone and have experienced no technical glitches or problems whatsoever. The keys are a touch difficult and the actual act of calling out is not ABC simple, but these minor issues are more than overcome by the consistent performance and solid range that this product provides. After suffering through a number of systems over the past few years, I am more than pleased with this one."
5,Great Phone - Great Value,This is an excellent phone set. Very good voice quality with many features. I have had several cordless phones in the past and this is the best.
5,An instant classic,"Most military scifi portrays combat in ridiculous fashion, is filled with two-dimensional characters, and leaves one feeling relieved when it comes to an end. If that is the kind of tripe you enjoy, then this book is most definitely NOT for you. Mr. Lusk, a veteran of the US Army, knows what soldiers and soldiering are truly like. And with his story of Chase Aarons, he shares these firsthand experiences with us. From his first childhood encounter with a combat mecha, which Lusk calls Man O' Wars, to the climax of his military career, we experience the triumphs and tragedies, the highs and lows, of the life of a protagonist so real you won't be able to put this book down. Be warned: this book will make you rethink everything you've ever thought you knew about soldiers."
4,Encore! Encore!,"If you've ever read any other giant combat robot novels, such as Battletech, you have no idea what such a book should be like. To find out, read the life story of Chase Aarons, a character so real, so full dimensional, you'll begin to believe he's an actual person. It's obvious that Lusk has spent time in the military, as he actually has clue one what combat is really like, and what it takes in the way of both people and machines to fight a war. A must read book for anyone who enjoys military sci-fi, or just a good war story."
3,I did not like this book.,"This book was a disappointment for me. It contains thorough information about China's regional disputes (the Spratlys, South China Sea, etc.) but little else about China's foreign relations outside of Asia. I have read far better reviews of China's foreign relations. I also could not help but notice that the book is somewhat sympathetic to Beijing."
5,I can't believe it's out of print...,"I read this book when it first came out (1980?), and have read, in English or German, 4 other novels by GG. All were wonderful, but this was my favorite. It's ""magic realism"" that's both thought-provoking and very entertaining, and so well-written and translated. It's really too bad that it's out of print."
2,Not worth the effort,"You say: a profound examination of gender politics deftly woven into a farce of German society, with interesting use of food politics as a metaphor.I say: an unnecessarily abstruse novel about one man's obsession with potatoes."
3,Not Exactly Sashimi Quality,"Gunter Grass, I love you, but ""The Flounder"" just isn't a sashimi quality piece of fish. It's really more something out of the frozen food section.""The Tin Drum"", the author's first book, remains one of the most white hot brilliant novels written in the last 100 years. It's the kind of book that in every sentence shows the desperate need the author had to tell his tale.By contrast, ""The Flounder"" is a tepid excercise that expresses no such fiery need. Sure, there are good ideas and interesting sections. However, the whole doesn't amount to much - in fact the book is more like a Mrs. Paul's fish stick than a gourmet pan of white fish - in effect, there seems to be far too much breading and not nearly enough good solid sea food in every bite.Perhaps it's unfair to compare everything Gunter writes to his first meteoric success. Still, when you have the power to write something like ""The Tin Drum"", you can't expect to get off with writing less."
3,"good, but not the best.","My friend got it for me. It's a good Gundam cd, but not the best. Some people might like it and some won't. If I didn't have I won't buy it, I don't dis like the cd, but like I said, you could get a better one."
4,"At Last, Wit and Passion","It's a marvel these days to come upon poems that have sense, sensibility, music, and passion, plus intelligence, all wrapped up in a single package. Downing is unfashionably brilliant, that is, he doesn't subscribe to any of the pieties of the ""creative writing"" establishment, and he sticks to (was it?) Ezra Pound, who said something like ""poetry must be at least as well written as prose."" Downing's stuff is delicious."
4,Very good product,I used to run a freezer in the back of my pickup when I went elk hunting. It ran for 4 days - all the way from Colorodo to Virginia.
1,Hard to say how good it is...,"It's hard to say if this is a great product or not because it only hooks up to battery with alligator clamps not the cigarette lighter like the other one I had. So, this is not going to be easy but it will have to be hardwired to the battery. UGH this is not a quick easy to go with so that my family can travel with a place to charge all the electronics or a TV...so it's kind of a waste for me because it's going to have to be mounted in one vehicle and with alot more effort."
1,be careful not as pictured,"description states that color may be varied, but I assumed it meant i was either getting this one the teal and yellow or the other older style blue and red. my two and half year old lost his last binky and based on the picture i ordered this to only be disappointed because they sent me a set of blue and a set of pink solid color."
5,Passy as promised,Everything was received as promised and right in time. These pacifiers are impossible to find in stores and are the only ones my daughter will use! Thank you so much for following through so quickly!
1,Disappointed!!Got wrong color pacifiers,I ordered these pacifiers for a baby boy and I ended up getting pink color pacifiers. I was really disappointed when I opened the package. There is no way I can use this pacifiers. I really wish there was an option to choose color. As it is a complete waste of money to buy a product which I'm never gonna use.
1,Disappointed,Before buying this particular one I asked if it was the bigger one not the newborn and was told yes buy a fellow customer who had purchased these... Sadly it was the smaller one and my son who is almost 13 months wont take it cause its to small. Last time I ever shop on line like this...
3,Small Pacifier,"I was looking for a First Essential pacifier that looks exactly like this one for my grandson. However, this nipple is a little smaller than the one he currently uses and he can tell the difference and refuses to take it."
5,thank goodness,Thank goodness that I was able to find these pacifiers on amazon! They are the only ones my son will use and it seems all the stores around have discontinued them. I wasn't too worried about color of pacifiers for when you are in need color doesn't matter...but only 2 days after placing the order I was pleased to have them arrive and extra happy to have gotten blue ones! Would order these again if I needed too!
3,Spine is Too Small!,"I bought this folder to hold about 150 big band charts. The folder is well constructed, but has what appears to be a strange design flaw that limits its use. Although the pockets are 1 1/4 inches deep, the spine of the folder is little more than 1/2 inch wide. Consequently, after I filled the pockets with my charts, the two sides of the folder wouldn't completely close flat against each other, and the edges of the charts next to the spine were pinched together. I could see that using the folder over time would damage it as well as the charts.This would be a excellent folder as long as the depth of the sheet music in each pocket was limited to no more than about 1/4 inch, but it didn't work for me."
1,"Poor product design, great service","I bought this folder to check out for possible use in 2 choirs I work with. The folder is well made but poorly designed. It's fine for carrying music around, but very clumsy as a performance folder. The worst problem is that there's no way to secure music while singing-- no binder rings, clips, or elastic bands. There are 2 large pockets, but the bulky flaps keep music from lying flat while you're reading it from the folder. The folder is large, maybe too large for people with small hands who need one hand to hold the music in the folder.On the plus side, the customer service from Musician's Friend was outstanding. The package was shipped securely and arrived quickly. The company was very responsive to my issues with the design and offered a prompt refund. I would definitely buy other products from this company."
3,You Might as Well Use the Internet,"The whole aim of this book is to figure out your birth chart, so, IMHO, if you have a computer and are online, check out the free natal charts that can be done for you. Do a bunch. And as for the meanings of the signs, houses, etc., etc., you can get those for free online as well. Please don't waste your money on this book. Note: you need to know your birth date, place, and time to get started. Good luck."
1,Untrustworthy,"We wrote the combination down. One week after we got it, it refused to open any more. We tried all the permutations with one before, and one after, for all 3 numbers. Nope. Now we have to cut a perfectly good cable (or try all 64,000 combinations, and maybe not even then)."
5,GREAT. The more you see it the better it becomes,"I saw this in the theatres about 10 times before it ever came out on video. Since I now have the video, I have seen it at least 50 times and it gets better each time. This is the type of show you must see about three times before it becomes great. Each time you see it, something new seems to show up. Would not recommend it to anyone under 16. Try it, you'll love it. It makes you think and use your brain."
5,We need these books back in print!,"The echo company series is the best series I have ever read, and believe me, I have read many. When my library stopped carrying them I was very upset. I finally have the 1st book and am looking for the others. I am asking people to join forces and get these books back in print! Please email me if you would like to help. mafia2@most-wanted.com"
4,An important work,"Derrida shows how Marxist and deconstructionist politics are relevant again to thinkers in the 1990s through 'spectropoetics.' If nothing else, the book reminds us that just as Hamlet is haunted by his father's ghost, so are we haunted by the legacy of Marxism."
5,Excellent book for learning caricature carving,"Pete takes you step by step through the process of carving a complete caricature figure. Each picture shows enough detail to easily follow and the carving steps are frequent enough so there isn't any wondering how he moved from the previous step. Pete emphasizes the importance of carving the head, since the most engaging feature of a caricature is the face. I have most of Pete's books and would recommend them all. If you are a beginning carver (as I am) or an experienced carver looking to try something different, this is the book for you."
4,Highly recommended,"When i bought this book, i had only done a few caricatures (which were pretty bad to be honest), and this book was very helpful. The steps are really easy to follow and will not leave you scratching your head saying ""How did he do that?""The only flaw with this book in my opinion is the poor binding. If you are a beginner and are having trouble creating caricatures as i was, i recommend this book. The things you need are a sharp carving knife, a gouge, and a piece of basswood. Very instructional book...."
5,"Finally, a complement to the many 4-shaft pattern books available.","This is a great book, it is not in the least snobish like several other 8-shaft books I've seen. It's a great go-to book for ideas and construction. If you can only get one, this would be my recommendation!"
5,Great book,"I just purchased an 8-harness loom; this book will be very helpful ... it has, already, with suggestions for my first project. It is designed much like my favorite 4-harness one ... Marguerite Davison."
3,A different way to think about ministry,"I thought that this book presented me with a different way to think about ministry in the church. It challenges the reader to think about how things are structured in their church and whether or not that structure reaches out to everyone that it possibly could. I particularly liked the 5 different types of curriculum that it laid out. The reflection exercies would be especially helpful if a church staff or small group were using this study together.The one thing that I didn't like about this book is that it didn't do a great job of making suggestions, giving examples, or even helping a congregation/ministry explore what its growing hedges were. I think that concrete things like those will really help to advance the church and its mission into the future instead of just theorizing about what learning in a church setting looks like."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"I found this book to contain no new information; it is essentially a remedial book which organizes the information in a slightly different format. It was painstaking to read and I could not wait to finally finish it; the only reason I read the entire book was that it was required. The one assertion made by Harris that I found inspirational can be found in the introduction, it is the quote from Acts 2:42, 44-47 which she labels as ""the first portrait of church curriculum we have"" (17). From that point on the book was a major let-down; it was nothing new under the sun."
5,Teaching the Bible to Adults and Youth,"Dick Murray's book, Teaching tthe Bible to Adults and Youth, presents a wide expanse of ideas and possibilities in Bible study. In this book, an educator should find an array of scenarios to open the Bible up to people. His comments on how Biblically illiterate adults and youth have become in our society are right on. He further commented on how we learn the Bible in seminary (limited as it may be), but we learn to teach from teachers."
4,Fashion Me a People,Maria Harris has written an awesome book on how the church should revamp it's image on teaching our people God's word. This is a must read for all teachers in the church (everyone).
4,A helpful resource,"Maria Harris did a very good job of laying out the fundamental ""curriculum"" aspects of a church. It was most helpful to have the exericses after each chapter for the reader(s) to put what have been learned into practice. As the author herself mentioned, ""the direction of education is shifting."" She laid out the ground work and it is up to the educator(s) to utilize what she has written accordindly to a learning evironment.""Insightful, and practical."" There are times when one would read a very good book and then ask the question, ""How do you use this in the church?"" Maria Harris did that. It is up to the reader(s) to apply what he/she has learned into his/her specific situation--whether that is a Sunday school class, Bible study, or in a classroom."
4,Good General Introduction,"This book shows is a good general introduction to the idea of Church Curriculum. What is most interesting is that her best chapters are about non-traditional ways of looking at how the church teaches. For example, teaching in worship, service and other areas.However, this book is highly dependent on Thomas Groome's Christian Religious Education. So I would see this book as a a first step in order to understand and better appreciate his book."
3,Workmanlike reading,"The deliberate pacing of Mackerra's performance of the 5th Symphony precludes excitement, especially in the last movement. The recording seems closely miked with resulting good instrumental detail, but full ensemble playing has a hard, flat sound with insufficient space. Low end is merely adequate."
5,Loved it!,"DVD arrived quickly and in great condition. I searched high and low for Starburst Edition dvds at a reasonable price since they stopped making them, and this was a great find. I'd definitely do business with them again!"
3,10 down...1 more to go!,I'm really disappointed that the quality of special features is declining with each passing starburst edition. SE 4.2 only has ONE audio commentary! The episodes contained in this set are pretty good but I cannot rate this set any higher than a 3 due to the lack of quality special features.
