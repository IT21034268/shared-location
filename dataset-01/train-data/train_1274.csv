4,easy and delicious,Can't say enough for this book of great Italian food and easy to follow recipes. Makes a great gift for people who loved the Sopranos.
5,love it,The ricotta pie is to die for. Try it! all really good recipes. alot like we already cooked but alot of new ones we tried and loved.
5,ITALIAN - HOME STYLE,I'LL TAKE THE RECIPES FROM THIS BOOK ANYTIME OVER FOOD FROM THE OLIVE GARDEN!! OR MOST OTHER RESTAURANTS FOR THAT MATTER.A FORMER BRONXITE
3,"A great read, fair cookbook and must for soprano's fans","I am not a big fan of the show,nor am i a good cook, but i was very pleased with this cookbook. I often read cookbooks for enjoyment not for recipe guidance and this one seemed to be made for me.It is, of course, based on the hit show. The chapters are divided into characters (instead of the usual food categories-dessert, main meals, appetizers, soups etc). It has a lot of pictures from the show and of the food. Their is an index for those looking for a particular recipe. The chapters features letters, comments, thoughts from the characters which any fan would enjoy.This cookbook is a fun read and is a tongue in cheek version of a cookbook- you can tell right away that the purpose is entertainment. The recipes seem like your typical hearty Italian fare- not for those counting calories!"
3,A Sopranos Rip-off,"These are NOT Sopranos' recipes. For true Sopranos fans the book is just a marketing ploy. The recipes sound very good but the only connection with the Sopranos is that they are for Italian food, (and there are some cutesy pie ""quotes"" from Sopranos characters). Carm's famous Lasagna recipe, ""with fresh basil leaves under the cheese"" as Uncle Junior tells Bobby when he tells her about the lasagna that Janice ""made"" but was really passing off as her own, isn't even included or attributed to her. How hard would that have been? Buy it for the recipes, if they look good to you, not for the Sopranos connection."
3,It's just another cookbook :(,"Since I LOVE the show, of course I had to have the book.Save your money!"
3,Sopranos Cookbook,"The product was stated as to be in almost perfect condition but when we received it, it really was not. There was writing on the inside of the cover, scratches, and i actually had to wipe it off because of something sticky on it. Not very impressed."
1,bada doodoo,"Although this is filled with show story lines, it is one of the worst Italian cookbooks I own. These people can't really be Italian!"
5,sopranos family cookbook,"My favorite cookbook. Especially, since I am now known for ""my sunday gravy"" and my family must have me make it. So if you want to impress your family and friends with ""YOUR SUNDAY GRAVY"", this is the book for you. Pass the love around. There are many other recipes that are delicious but this one hit the home run - go Marlins."
1,Yawn,"Watching a gal look for an apartment, then not like it, putting it up for sublet after she ""feels weird"" about it, and her dating the owner & throw in a stalker mixed with her lover/landlord/friend isn't my idea of an interesting movie, nor is mixing relationships, psychos & violence.It took 3 tries to make it through the movie without having the urge to change the channel, put in another movie or simply fall asleep.The 1st 15 minutes is literally the lead character looking for an apartment, then the next 1/2 hour is her getting to know her landlord & moving in.A very unlikely story, extremely predictable plot that seems it came out of a plot couching book, yet instead of a plot twist, some loud & bizarre flashing junk on the screen that has little to do with the story at all. Perhaps a student film?Just didn't do anything for me & the stalker factor was a turn-off."
3,Falls Short,"Thriller, Suspense.The description on TV guide makes you think it's a supernatural film...it's not.Very atmospheric in 1st part of movie - harkens back to the suspense movies of the 70's/ very narrative.THEN it takes a darker turn. I loved the vehicle they used to turn the movie on its head.Hard to watch in some parts due to the theme of the movie.Hillary Swank is one of the executive producers. Done by Hammer films and, of course, Christopher Lee has a small but brilliant part.As one reviewer noted there are some 4/5 star aspects (acting, music, cinematography) in this movie; but, overall it is 3 stars."
1,What happened?,"Nothing happened. Oh, there was the nail gun, sorry. I don't normally do this, but I had to fast forward through a lot of this ""film"" to keep from dozing off. Very predictable, annoying! with the first part saturated with some type of irritating! shake-shots. I could barely understand the dialogue; it sounded like they were half drunk chewing marbles. Hey Swank, as much as I love you, take a few couses in Shakespeare and learn to act, or at least articulate. I threw the DVD in the trash."
1,My Friend Flicka Gets Stalked by Huey Downey Jr.!,"I'm sorry, but this predictable piece of wallow was a complete waste of time. Hillary Swank is a very good actress, but any guy being obsessed with her is incomprehensible to me, much less one that looks and acts like a cross between Robert Downey Jr. and Huey Lewis on crack. She looks hot on the box cover, but you put the movie in and it's the winner of the Kentucky Derby all over again. I'm sorry, but talent and looks don't always go together, and this movie was a bad showcase for her talent. Just like Obsessed, Fatal Attraction, Mother May I Sleep with Dummy, and Sleeping with the Idiot, this is just another in a long line of predictable thrillers with no thrill at all. You've seen it before, heard about it before, smelled it before, etc. Pass this one up. If you want a good thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat the first time you watch it, check out The Perfect Host with David Hyde Pierce."
2,sad return for Hammer,"Just saw this and have to say it was vastly underwhelming. Swank is a greatt actress, and the rest of the cast was decent as well, but they just had nowhere to go. What could've been a highly suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat thriller was marred by terrible dialogue, extremely predictable situations, and every cliche of these types of films in the book. And one of the saddest things was how Christopher Lee was wasted. The whole thing was painful to watch. Yeah, the camera work was a bit above par, and the reverse sequences were interesting, but the first went on way too long after we all got the idea. Hopefully, Hammer will improve."
3,NO PLACE LIKE HOME,"Seems like any Oscar winner worth their salt has to make a thriller/horror movie. Halle Berry's GOTHIKA. Sissy Spacek. Meryl Streep. Nicole Kidman et al. Now 2-time Best Actress Hilary Swank is THE RESIDENT.While moderately entertaining, THE RESIDENT offers nothing really original. It's ultimately a stalker movie with no real insight into the stalker's psyche or motivation. It's also slowly paced and has an inevitable ending.Swank does well enough in her role but it's certainly not Oscar-worthy. This ""new"" Hammer film even has the iconic Christopher Lee in a too-small role and talented Lee Pace is virtually wasted as Swank's ex. The real casting problem is in Jeffrey Dean Morgan's villain. Morgan, a good actor, doesn't provide much depth in his switch from nice to nasty although this could be the writers' fault.THE RESIDENT isn't an awful film, but considering the talent involved, is disappointing."
4,The Shy Guy.......,"We were told to be careful of the *shy* ones, for they never turn out the way you think. This one wouldn't take the innocent kiss offered, but he sure took what he wanted when *the lights were out.* I enjoyed this movie and I loved these two main characters together. There were very few scenes out of the apartment, but just enough to give us a peek into their outside life. This movie reminded me of the film with Jennifer Lopez, called ENOUGH. When we need to defend ourselves, we find courage and strength from where none existed. If I had a friend moving to a big city, I'd probably insist they watch this movie. Enjoyable."
5,good film,It was a good buy I bought it was good to watch and I would even watch it again great film
5,Love this Movie,I really LOVE this movie. I don't know why it never made it to the Theater. It is filled with suspense and keep you guessing for the entire movie. Hiliary is great as usual. I highly recommend this movie.
5,Entertaining at best,"I loved this movie, though if your living alone, it may make you think about what kind of landlord you may have and if you get a really good price on rent, than you may just want to be aware of that. It started off in the typical way, a young professional woman looking for an apartment, the landlord seems innocent, you may even think it's the landlords father who is the culprit, but in that case as the movie moves through you start to see just how the landlord lured and planned certain things and yes he is strange, obssessed, and creepy for a normal looking guy, but than it all unfolds, he is jealous of the boyfriend and now all hell breaks loose. Resident is a great movie and very entertaining."
2,A misfire,"In short if you watch one Hammer comeback film this year, watchWake Wood [Region 2 UK DVD] [2011] Starring Dan Gordon and Ruth McCabeand not this very average, let-down of a film.To be fair the first half has an interesting build up of tension ...but 'the big twist' comes too early in the narrative and we are left with a very long, very formula third act that goes on forever and is a bit dull. Christopher Lee is wasted too, which is a bit unforgivable. Hopefully Hammer will keep going and do better in future."
3,About subtitles,"Hello everyone,Can anyone tell me if the Blu-Ray version comes with Spanish subtitles?I would love to buy it but I need to know if it comes with it.Please answer.Thanks"
2,"""A"" cast in B movie","As someone else said, we've seen this movie before...many, many times before. What was I watching before I put in this? Captivity. What was the movie coming on after that? Sliver. Swank, a great actress, is her usual solid self but Morgan is just too good looking for the role, you know? Lee Pace is barely in the film, darn it all. And while I know New York is expensive, could Swank's character, even as a doctor, afford a $3800 apt? What about all her student loans? And, well, when Swank is all dolled up, she's good looking but rarely is Swank all dolled up in this film. The movie is actually not a B movie, by production and acting standards but it's such a recycled same old story that it can't be elevated beyond B status.You want to see a really good stalker/prey movie, see P2. Not quite the same old story set in a new environment. Plus, there's a doggie, LOL. See it and you'll now what I mean."
1,Dear Hilary Swank: FIRE YOUR AGENT!!!,"First off, I'm not a fan of Hilary Swank, nor do I hate her. It's just that after doing what most actresses can only dream--winning multiple acting Oscars--you would expect her to have a good sense for bad scripts. How this one slipped through is beyond me. This is your standard stalker movie, complete with the cliches of The Talking Killer and The Killer Who Looks Dead But Really Isn't.Kudos to Mr. Morgan, he was a little bit creepier than your usual stalker, and Christopher Lee did a nice job in all of the 2 minutes he was onscreen, but they weren't able to save this stinker. Save your money, watch some paint dry (it will be more entertaining too)."
2,"""A"" ACTORS IN A ""B"" MOVIE","This is your classic ""B"" grade peeper movie with high priced actors. Hillary Swank plays an ER doctor looking for an apartment. She finds the idea place with a good looking landlord. The drawback is that Christopher Lee also lives there. The movie then shows you blurred views of Hillary naked from camera angles that make you think she is being watched. It also makes good use of shadows and noises to add to the effect that someone is in her apartment. Unfortunately this doesn't last long as the peeper/creeper is revealed way too soon, and it is not Eric Roberts. The movie short changes us on the nudity/sex scenes normally in a B grade movie and opts to give us some groping. They attempted to create a first class peeper film, but fell way short. I can't believe Hillary Swank isn't getting better movie offers."
1,Waste of my time.........,"This movie is very poor, plain and simple. I was interested in seeing it because Christopher Lee was again appearing in a Hammer film and I thought perhaps that would be a good thing. Well, he IS, but the film is NOT! Every now and then I found titles that have gone direct to video that were worth viewing. IN this case, it just isn't so. How in the world did Hilary Swank get roped into this one? It must have looked good on paper, but this movie goes nowhere and it take a LONG time to do it.ON the plus side it is a good looking transfer with decent sound as well. But in the end that will not save it from having a very poor story that leaves you unfulfilled and wondering why you wasted a couple hours with it. Avoid this one if you value your time."
1,I regret I watched this movie,"What a waste of time, blood all over. and sickness.Hilary, I wished you did a favor to the cameras and act.This movie spoiled my evening."
2,You Have Seen This Movie Before,"Whether you realize it or not you have seen this movie before. You say you haven't? I beg to differ. If you have seen anything like Lakeview Terrace,Fear, Unlawful Entry, Pacific Heights,The Crush, or any other number of movies that fall into the same genre then you have seen The Resident. The Resident does not bring anything new into the genre either. It follows the same boring and trite formula. Even the good performances by Hillary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are not enough to save this movie from being mediocre at best.Keep your money in your pocket and skip this one."
3,Good for straight to DVD.,Enjoyed this flick. A lot of good thrillers go straight to DVD. I think this one could have made it at the theater. It was scary and acting was good.
3,"Predictable, but entertaining.","So - Hillary Swank! I like her - I mean who doesn't, right? I'd never heard of this film. Was this even released in theaters?-This movie was entertaining, yet predictable. I mean, look at the cover: it says ""Resident"" - and shows Hillary herself looking scarily onto some guy. So - it makes it clear who the bad guy is, right? I mean - they make no bones about it right from the get-go. So, that makes it predictable. Yet, the movie itself is still pretty entertaining. I quite liked it but could not give it more than 3 stars. Well, you pretty much know what's going on from the very beginning, and I thought they might throw me a twist or something, but they don't. Still - it's fun to watch. The music, the setup, the words - we've all seen it before. However, it was still pretty fun to watch, even if you already know what's up and how it will end."
5,This is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is one for all ages. I have a 2 year old who insists that I play track 1, Put Your Hands Up, over and over and over. I also have an 87 year old grandmother who loves the ballads, My Soul, Healed Heart, Lord I Believe and Trust You More.I also love I Like It and Survivors, which is not only applicable to the Hurrican Katrina Victims, for whom it was apparently written, but for everyone who is trying to make it in this world.I can put this cd in my radio and play it continuously non-stop. Darius I love this cd as much if not more than your previous cd, Your Will. Keep writing great music that touches the soul."
5,I really appreciate Soto's gift and challenge!,"Soto delineates nineteen-year-old Chicano boy who has no luck in his life despite his continuous efforts to improve it. In contrast to the serious plot, Soto's narrative tone is modest, restrained, and, at times, humorous, similar to less serious books he has written before, and his insight is vivid and precise. His challenge in this work has been triumphant!"
2,indifferent to buried onions.,"I find myself indifferent to this book. it neither appealed to me, nor repulsed me. It's analogy of the onion under the city was one that i have experienced before having lived in fresno, and do understand the consept of consuption by your surroundings. As for the characters i did not care for any of them as people. I put myself in the position of almost all of them and found that i was amuned to their pain. perhaps this book was about something more and i just did not see it. never the less i am not about to reprimand this book on the count that i am desensitized to starvation, crime, and being of the lower class."
2,Buried Onions,"Eddie the main character in the story has had his father, his couisin, and his best friend killed by stupid street violence.Eddie handles himself pretty good."
2,Bowl with a hole!,"This would be a lovely Denby bowl if not for the slit in the bottom of it, which must have been made before it was fired as it is not a crack but a cut that looks like a knife made it. This was not billed as a 'second' so I am disappointed and will now go back to Macy's to buy my Denby bowls. The slit does not go all the way through but I doubt that it will last long once it has been in and out of the dish washer a few times. Live and learn I guess."
5,Classy Fun,"I really like this collection. I am just starting to get into Opera music and there is a track from this album that was featured on the Marie Antoinette soundtrack, the full album is wonderful and so nice to listen to to just relax."
2,could be so much better,"Pros:- surface feels nice- buttons work ok- cool glow effect- easy to carry aroundCons:- no ergonomics and poorly designed. For example, the ""illumination off"" button is located in the lower left corner of the keyboard and occupies valuable realestat instead of the unused top right- the buttons are too small, space bar is difficult to press and easy to miss.- letter are cheaply transfered onto the surface and will weare out easyWould recommend trying it before buying it first.. If I only had the packaging I would not have kept mine.."
4,use of illuminated keyboard,The keyboard connected easily and worked right away. It performs exceptionally well and it is easy and relatively natural to type on. I recommend it.
2,Portable Keyboard for Stay-at-home-use,"We bought this as I am an early riser and having a lighted keyboard seemed the ideal solution for use in hotel rooms without disturbing my wife.Sadly, while the translucent keyboard is illuminated with back-lighting, the opaque keys are not. The result being that in a dark room all one sees is a series of black squares sitting on the glowing blue plastic.The keys themselves are imprecise, require significant down force, and are not suitable for touch typing.The power-supply for the keyboard has a high-pitched annoying whine.It does pack nicely, but it will not be going on any further trips with us."
4,Fun but not perfect,"I love the fact that this keyboard is very quiet, and being in a family of gadget & technology junkies, the coolness factor is great. However, I am a fast typist and I have lots of problems with apparently not hitting the space keys just right and I have to go back & insert spaces where they should have been. It is really, really irritating and I am glad that I only have to use it to do a few hours of work a week. I could not use this keyboard full time."
4,Changes the Way You Type,"I used earlier versions of this device for many years. They worked very well for me and I may order another. But before you rush to purchase one, you should clearly understand a few things.ONE: You have to hit the keys HARD. VERY HARD. These keyboards turned me into a very loud typist when using a more standard keyboard. On the other hand, these keyboards themselves are very quiet even when you are pounding away.TWO: I am a very poor typist. I have lousy technique and make a lot of errors. I suspect that one of the reasons why I like soft keyboards is that they force me to slow down and thus make fewer errors. I suspect that a great typist would not like a soft board.THREE: Yes you can wash these things with soap and water, but they still wear-out just like any keyboard.Where these devices excel is in a very dirty or wet environment and in healthcare setting where they can be sterilized quickly and easily."
1,poor response,"I don't believe the keyboard is that functional if you want to type quickly. I ended up liking the keyboard for my laptop better - I had purchased it to replace the laptop keyboard with a full keyboard so I could have the numpad. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,sucked,unles you press very hard and straight on the keypad they dont register waiste of money especially if you type fast
2,should be very destructible not virtually indestructible,"I bought this keyboard 9 months ago. The jelly like keys take a lot of getting used to, you have to press about twice as hard as regular keyboard keys. Though it looks cool, it gets filthy very fast and very easily which is why the best feature is the washable part. After owning this for only 9 months none of the 3 spacebars work and the E key stopped working entirely. Many of the working keys have to be pressed numerous times to work (at random). This keyboard had never left my desk and had only ever been wiped down with a slightly damp cloth. I had never curled it up, dropped it, spilled anything on it, twisted it or mistreated it in any way. It didn't even make it a year. I was very disappointed."
4,Nice keyboard with a couple quirks,Keyboard has a rubber feel to it and works as expected. Typing speed is definitely slower with this keyboard. You really need to hit the keys right in the middle for them to register which will take some getting used to. It rolls up nicely and fits into my backpack and I like the lightup feature. Makes typing in the dark easier. I am using this keyboard at both home and work and it seems to be handling my pounding fairly well.
2,"Cool keyboard, but hardto use.","I've beenusing this keyboard for over a month. I was looking for a totally quiet keyboard that I could use while watching TVwith my family withut annoying them with the clicking sound most eyboards mae. This is really cool because I can also use it in darkness since the keyboard glows. however, the keys are difficult to use. You have to push stright don on them with a fair amount of pressure, or they don't register. I'm a good typer and speller, but I carefully typed this paragraph without looking at my screen andyou cansee the missed keystrokes caused by this keyboard. I'll use it when I need to be quiet but otherwie I plug inmynormal non-Flex keyboard so i don'thave to correct so many typos."
2,Too Hard To Use,"I bought this keyboard even though it has received mixed reviews, and I am sorry that I did. The keys are too difficult to strike correctly; if you do not press them down directly in the middle you will not get a keystrike and instead hit a 'glancing blow' that produces no result.And the ultmate deal breaker: The ON/OFF switch for the light is exactly where the CTRL key should be! I only used it for an hour and in that hour I must have turned the light on or off 6 times when trying to copy/paste.Please, unless you have perfect finger control, save your money and look elsewhere for a lit/backlit keyboard."
2,"Not indestructable, or practical, but kinda cool.","LIKES:-glows green - has on/off button for this feature.-nice rubbery texture.-one could roll it up relatively small, throw it around, etc. and probably not hurt it.-silent use.DISLIKES:-have to press hard/awckwardly because keys WOBBLE A LOT.-typing speed significantly reduced.-hand discomfort increased.-children can and will love to because of the rubbery feel-pull the keys off one by one- and quickly, too! (I thought, 'hey, indestructable, I can let him touch it for a sec...' Nope. In under ten seconds a key was ripped loose. The silicon is very thin and the keys are inviting to peel off, so watch out!"
1,Arrived Busted,Mine arrived with a short in the circuitry. It could be a fluke or a flaw in the manufacturing process. We'll see after I get a replacement.
3,"Nice . . . BUT, could be better . . .","I like the silent keyboard (esp since I'm heavy handed), the option to clean it is nice and the illumination is great (esp in dim light) . . . BUT . . . there is one BIGGIE that annoys me, the printing on the keys wears off within 1 yr of use so I can't see what letters go to each keys. I have gone so far as trying to write on the keys w/ perm magic marker, but that doesn't last long. I've tried writing to the manufacturer (at least twice in over 3 yrs), to suggest that they have RAISED letters/numbers on their keys but so far they seem to ignore my suggestion as I never get any response back from them. I would LOVE to find a similar design with RAISED letters!!!!!!!!!!!!! Raised letters would be great for folks like me w/ poor eyesight at least I would be able to feel the letters."
4,Replacement for a worn out one,"I love my quiet keyboard. Love that it lights up, can use it late at nite w/o disturbing anyone. You just have to be sure to hit the keys hard, or they don't type."
2,glowtype keyboard,This product is just alright I thought it sounded wonderful by the reviews on the web site. I ordered one the keyboard feels like a mac keyboard. The keys have to be mashed much harder than on a regular keyboard and the space bar doesn't always space. Overall not a good bargain for the price.
2,Indestructable and Unreliable,"I bought this for my fiance. He always complained about not being able to see the keys on his keyboard at night (he only uses a tiny desk lap if i'm trying to sleep in the room). It lit up GREAT and it tucks away nicely but even with his sloooow typing it was hard for him to type. I tried to use it a few times and with the speed I type at NOTHING came out.If you are an ultra deliberate typer then by all means get the keyboard. if not, save your money."
2,Good idea- bad Execution,"I was looking for a silent keyboard that would glow- this sounded like a great buy from the description. I tend to be at the computer a lot so seeing that i eat there a lot, a food/liquid proof keyboard that's washable sounded great! And it is, if you look past the fact that you can barely type a sentences correctly without going back and having to add spaces and fix typos.I write, email, chat, and play video games on the pc, so this is a major problem. You have to very deliberately push down on the keys, rather hard (sore fingers aren't rare), and yet if you push them too hard it'll give you a double key-stroke. It's pretty much impossible to type quickly.If you are a 2-finger typer, the type that are very slow and dont type a whole lot, this can work. Otherwise, don't bother. Buy something better, please."
3,Very hard to get used to.,"I don't want to say this keyboard is bad, it actually looks very cool. But if you're so used to hitting the keys hard, you're not going to get used to this one. The keys are very soft and squishy. I returned it for it's not working for me."
1,First time user,"I got one of theseandamusing itfor thefirst time. As yucan see, typing onit is ntasasy asyu might think. ihopethekeys loosen upa bit over time..escialythespae bar.Not real happyright now."
3,Flexible Lighted Keyboard Review,"The lighted keyboard has advantages for doing slide show presentations under dim lighting conditions and is easily packable. I am still getting used to using it for typing on a routine basis. I find the keys require increased deliberate pressure to function (compared to a standard keyboard) when doing substantial typing. It is not a desirable keyboard for some one who has a ""light touch"" as numerous errors can occur."
4,Glowtype USB keyboard,"This item was delivered on time in new condition. While I wouldn't use this as my main keyboard because some of the keys, and there are 109 are a little harder to get to make contact so every once in a while there are missing letters. Still a very good keyboard and one that I won't have to worry about any pet hair, liquid or keys coming off. All in all a very good product."
3,better before got puppy,I fell in love with this book before my puppy came. Unfortunately once my puppy arrived I did not find it as helpful. There is too little talk about parents who work full time and what to do when problems arise from this. Also when trying to solve a problem there is just one solution. What if that doesn't work? In frusteration I also bought The Art of Raising a Puppy and Mother Knows Best. I think a combonation of all of these will be better. No one book will help solve all problems.
1,Don't Read this Book!,"I am still sorry I got this book, it gave me the worst advice--all this nonsense about training with a collar (ouch) and not letting your dog sleep with you--my dog's first night was awful, he was crated in another room and cried and threw up until I disregarded this book and got up and slept next to him. The book is based on the idea of dominating your dog. A terrible and cruel approach. Instead of this book get ""Culture Clash"" by Jean Donaldson--the BEST book I have read about dog training. ""Culture Clash"" involves treating your dog with respect and affection, using a POSITIVE instead of a PUNITIVE approach. I have used this approach from early on and my dog behaves beautifully!!!!!!!"
2,"Good Owners, Great Dogs",I was dissappointed in this book. Information was too general. It seemed as if the author wrote a book summing up what any dog owner already knows.
5,GREAT BOOK!,Kilcommons translates the human thought process to the canine thought process. I wish I had this book years ago. Once you read it everything suddenly makes sense.
3,A good starting point,This book is a good starting point and could be helpful but I think a lot of the statements are generalizations and presented as facts about dogs. I would use the training as an outline but keep in mind that all dogs are different.
4,Outstanding,"This is a great step by step book for raising a puppy. Lots of problem solving advice and illustrated instructions on training. I would highly recommend it. Sort of the ""Dr. Spock"" for dogs."
4,I was looking for how to deal with dog aggression,"Most of the book is on training with pictures, and I was looking for more information on how to tackle dog vs. dog agression. It's a great book for a new dog owner though."
5,WOW! SUPER training book!,"We didn't know a thing about dogs or raising puppies or training for that matter. Now our 3 month old puppies can sit, watch, lay down and come. This book shouldn't be substituted for a good obedience class but it will give you something to do while you wait for the class to start or if you don't have a class in your area. This book trains you to train your dog/puppy in kind yet firm ways. It talks about bad behaviors and retraining, interpreting what your dog is actually doing/saying, gives lots of advice and encouragement.This is one of the best books available for training!"
5,Wonderful dog training book,If you have a dog question this is the book for you! I have used this book on many instances to help dog behavior problems my dogs have had. I would most definately recommend this book to anyone!
2,Much better books out there!,I do a lot of reading on dog training. I personally feel like many methods in this book are harsh. For example some uses of the shake can are somewhat upsetting to me. It is suggested if your puppy is crying in his crate to hide around a corner and throw the shake can on the floor near him. Using this method you frighten your dog every time they cry. I have two dogs I have trained with positive reinforcement and it hurts me to think about training them using fear. While I'm sure this method works I personally do not agree with it. The last thing I want to do is my dog feel unsafe or frightened. I gave this book three stars because there are some really good pointers and some useful information to be taken away.
5,"classic, fun, common sense we have great dogs!","We have used this book for our last 2 forever dogs training, including a therapy dog. We have passed it on to many folks. The trick to it all is YOU, the human, taking the time to work with your dog and using positive reinforcement. I used this information and sited Brian in writing an article on therapy dogs. I am buying another copy for a friend who is opening a dog walking business! Great Book!"
5,From Wau! to Wow!,"To me the book was an interesting example for the US-American approach (I'm German). It's great, the fun-fair-firm motto can't be emphasized too often! Fun! The book shows in every example, how you should adjust your human viewpoint to that of your dog's and not to that of your nerves, even if that's not what we normally do..I loved the example stories, but then I generally want explications. If you want a three step advice, you might have to check the index, but it's all there. Brian Kilcommon treats all dogs fair, I've noticed in other books, that some authors could not refrain from ridiculing small breeds or s.th. The fotos, in my opinion, really reveal that that man loves dogs and is serious about what he tells you because he lives it. I'm going to push this book into the hands of all dog owners I know! With the heartfelt wish, that one dog, whose only wish is his/her owners happiness might be treated better, with more fun to both sides!"
1,Cowering Dog,"If you want to produce a cowering dog who is afraid of your every move and of his environment, this book is for you. If you want your dog to be a great companion, do not implement the scare tactics prescribed in this book. Look instead for the positive reinforcement techniques in books such as The Complete Idiot's Guide to Positive Dog Training by Pamela Dennison or The Other End of the Leash by Patricia B. McConnell."
5,Kilcommons does Woodhouse proud!,"Brian Kilcommons has written a how-to masterpiece on commonsense dog training! He does Barbara Woodhouse proud by carrying on her no-nonsense approach to living and working with animals. My copy of his book is so well used that I can nearly quote entire passages! I have loaned it out to several family members, and will probably have to buy a new copy, because my brother doesn't want to give it up! The only time that this book isn't effective, is when the reader refuses to follow the simple instructions given. I am sold on his methods, and wish that I had stumbled upon this understanding of dog behavior 15 years ago. It would have enabled us to keep 2 or 3 ""impossible"" pets! This is a MUST READ for anyone who considers themself a dog lover, but has had trouble training a dog. We couldn't live with our dogs without it!"
3,Excellent advice for superhumans,"Brian Kilcommons certainly has a grip on dog psychology, and I believe if one follows his advice to the T, many dogs will be well adjusted and well behaved. However there is the reality factor: most modern day yuppies, strained for time and patience will not be able to carry out the tips to 100% capability. For example, he advises, ""only spend 10 minutes per hour paying attention to your dog."" Probably commendable, but do we have to carry around an egg timer? However, his advice to make a dog ""work"" for their comforts is an excellent one, and has reaped good behavior in my shepherd collie mix."
4,"Good Owners, Great Dogs - New Puppy? A must read.","Easy to follow/read. Wether or not you are a first time owner, it is a great reference and a reminder of what to do and not to do. I enjoyed reading it and definitely found it helpful with our new puppy."
5,Best book ever,"We have read a lot of the dog training and ownership books out there, trying to obtain enough information on how to have a well mannered pooch and this book was by far the easiest, most reliable read. It tells you like it is and really gets to the heart of the matter. We give this book as a ""puppy"" gift to our friends and family whenever a new dog comes into their lives. Highly recommended for new and old dog owners alike."
5,Great new series for younger readers,Mrs. Haddix has done it! This is a wonderful beginning chapter book for late 2nd/3rd grade readers. This will make a good read-aloud for class or small discussion groups. A terrific lesson on family relationships and values. Good book to help children who have recently transferred to a new school. The characters are enjoyable and endearing. Very believable and current topics for today's elementary age child.
5,A Fun Book to Read,"Today, in my mother, daughter club we talked about Janie and how we are like her. Her mother knits these sweaters for a company, but the company doesn't want them. So, every day Janie wears the sweaters her mother knitted. I would recomend this book to read because Janie goes through being a really new kid in school, and because it tells you it's okay to be new in a new school."
4,kind of the worlds best book,The book I read was the girl with 500 middle names. I like the way the author adds details and knows when to start a new chapter and go into more exciting things. The main character in this good story is Jaine who. The who stands for all of the names her mom puts on sweaters. The main character Jaine ends up in alot of trouble making up middle names that aren't even hers. Jaine has to descover how to change all these middle names to stop. You would like to read this book because ypu can learn not to use other peoples names.
4,world's best book,I read the book the girl with 500 middle names. The author of this is Margaret Peterson Haddix.I liked this book because it reminded me of my sister because she crowshase's and in this book Janie's mom sowes. Janie is the main character in this book. The risen I liked the auther is because she adds good detail. I like this book and I would lended it to a friend because one of my friends likes mysteries and this book is a mystery.
1,no libretto--how disappointing!,"I was very excited when this CD arrived in the mail, but my hopes were quickly dashed when I realized the libretto was missing. I bought the CD used, but there was no indication in the description that it was missing the libretto. That would have been very helpful to know, since I don't have a score to follow, and the recording of an opera in a foreign language is very hard to follow without a libretto, or even a summary of the plot. I am so frustrated and disappointed that I don't know if I'll ever buy a used opera CD online again."
3,Maybe if you don't like having skin either.,"I have pretty sensitive skin and it dries out pretty easily. Unfortunately, my dry sensitive skin is paired with thick, coarse hair that grows back as soon as I get a chill.First of all, this takes forever. Your basically sanding down your body to get rid of stubble.Secondly, you'll get determined to work on a stubborn hair or patch which in turn will ""burn"" your leg.Thirdly, it dries out your skin, which is to be expected, but when you go to put lotion on, it's not fun since the thing basically gave you extreme rug burn."
2,Don't like it!,"I bought this product cause I previously used the Smooth Away hair removal system which worked well but was very time consuming. I thought this would be faster and more effective but in fact it seems to be a waste of my time and money. It's not very easy to use as u have to keep holding down the button while u move it in circular motions along your skin. It gets hot while you're using it and for the length of time keeping it in one area, it doesn't remove much hair at all. It is especially difficult to use on the shinbone area probably because of it's size and inflexibility as opposed to the smooth away pads. I really regret buying this product as it was a total disappointment!"
1,angel,Junk Junk It does not work and when you use even the lowest speed you get burned I dont have sensitive skin either.
4,Great but not included everything,"This product works great, tried many different hair removal techniques and this one being one of the best I found. Only complaints I have for this item is that i only received the four larger discs and not any of the smaller discs."
2,CONAIR 2-Speed Hair Removal System Model HB5R,"Good thing this was cheap. It kinda sorta works, but it's very time-consuming. My wife wanted it, and she has used it for over a month. She's not happy with it because it takes too long and the results are not what she expected."
2,Glad it was cheap,"I'm not at all pleased with this product. It's too difficult to use and can cause painful ""skin burns"". I would not buy it again."
4,Works great! It's not perfect but it does the job.,"I just got this in the mail yesterday and i was pretty excited to try it out. I've tried all kinds of things to keep my legs smooth, but nothing really worked and it has cost me a lot of money. After about 15 minutes of using this product my legs were smooth to the touch and my skin felt great. I did use moisturizer afterwards which made it even better. Usually I have stubble overnight from shaving, but this morning i woke up and my legs were still smooth!I can't wait to keep using it and eventually get my desired results."
3,on the fence,"i used it the first day and it surprisinglly worked but i definitely would not agree with the ""rapid hairmoval"" description it has. it took me near a half hour just to do one leg. it got rid of a majority of the hair, but not all of it. its hard to get around the ankles, even with the small pads.doesnt really work for finer hairs. so in short it works when you first use it but then starts to not show the great results you want. but it still works... i guess i'm on the fence. it works really good for getting rid of the callouses on feet, nice and soft."
1,It doesn't work very well.,"I've used this hair removal gadget a few times now. It works pretty well on my legs as long as I have about a half an hour of free time to use - not excellent -- but pretty well. As far as removing hair ""in other places"", it's terrible! Can't seem to be done without causing a severe rash. I've used Smooth Away Hair Removal in the past and am going back to that product. It works much better."
3,Simple and easy,"Simple and easy to use, your legs will feel very smooth after. But you're basically ""sanding"" your hair off, so it will regrow. Didn't find it painful to use. My biggest gripe is that the pads wear out quickly and are hard to find. Due to this I quit using mine."
4,Works Great!,"It works great! I've owned one for YEARS, since they first came out. The hard part now is finding the replacement pads for it. I used to be able to get them from Conair but not anymore. Other places I've found that they are expensive! So I purchased this new one just for the replacement pads. I did toss my own machine and now using the new one. I only gave it 4 stars because the replacement pads are hard to find."
2,I didnt really like it!,I just didnt like it! it wasnt for me! I didnt like the way it felt on my skin and it felt like it was just scraping my skin and it didnt really remove the hair! I would not recommend
3,Yes it works but it's time consuming and DUSTY,"It does do the job but you have to keep going over the same area and I got some serious ""rug burns"" after all was said and done. I also got to vacuum my entire bathroom and then dust too in order to get rid of all the white, powdery dust that covers everything in sight. I still own it, somewhere in the back of a deep closet, but I'll stick with a razor."
2,Not used for purpose intended,"Well I bought this thinking it might actually work, But it doesn't. The only reason I gave it two stars is like other reviewers its great for exfoliating my feet! They feel so smooth and look so much better after a few minutes of use. If you are thinking about purchasing this for hair removal don't bother. And it said it came with an instructional DVD and it wasn't there."
3,Hair Removal System,It works but takes time and care not to press too hard.The Four large discs were in the box but the two smaller discsand the bottle of after-use moisturizer were not in the shipment.I really do need the smaller discs more than the large ones.
3,okay product,"This does remove the hair, but takes quite a while. Plus, I found it pretty painful to use as my only source of hair removal. So, I use it to go over stubble from the previous day shaving."
2,non satisfaction,je trouve'que ce produit n'est pa efficace du tout...je lai essayer plusieurs fois et ca enleve juste un tout petit peu les poils.Bref je suis très decu de ce produit..
2,don't waste your money,"Thank God I only paid less than $5 for this item! It does not work! I repeat it does not work! Stick to the creams, waxing, and traditional shaving to remove unwanted hair."
1,useless,"I received this system about a month ago and I've used it just once for its purpose (shaving).It's completely useless. It doesn't give the close shave at all. The same thing az razer, I would even say - WORSE.I don't have that many facial hairs but I decided to try it anyways...OMG! It was the worst idea ever.All the small hairs stayed exactly there they were! But my skin....it was...shaved. I was burnt. The spot I tried to shave was red for the next two days and it looked like somebody kicked me or I fell down from the stairs...it was AWKWARD.Moreover, it did hurt. I couldn't even sleep for the forst night.I have fine skin and I don't have many facial or body hair. So it's completely useless for me.I use it on my feet now to exfoliate rough skin."
1,Waste of time,Wife hates it waste of time and money :-(I thought it would be good based on the other reviews
1,$11.55 for shipping?!?!,They must be shipping this product from Mars! I wish Amazon would do something about vendors that lower the price of products to get people interested and then charge unrealistic shipping fees to increase revenue. It is poor business and it damages the reputation of Amazon partners.
3,Not as easy to use as it should be.,"You have to hold the power button down the whole time you are using this product. This is tiresome and difficult when you have to move the device all around to make contact with your legs or arms. The head of the device does not fit comfortably against your legs. It's flat and you have to keep adjusting your hold on it to keep the head of it in contact with your legs. (It works by ""sanding"" off the hair from your body.) Your skin does feel nice and soft afterward. But it takes a long time to sand-off the hair and as I said you have to hold the power button on through-out."
1,KEEP AWAY!,"I bought this hair removal system in the forlorn hope that it would actually work well to remove body hair. After reading through the instructions a few times and trying it out, I found this product to be a complete waste of time and money. I tried to remove hair using the booklet's method of light fast passes across the area in a clockwise motion. This did nothing. it removed no hair whatsoever. When I tried a more agressive approach, I found my skin to be red, irritated and downright painfull for the next three to four days. This product does not work. I dont know if the people who gave this thing five stars were bribed or what, but this product simply doesn't work."
2,Great idea but doesn't cut it close,"I have very tough and coarse hair like nylon fibers. This product did the trick and left me smooth in the areas where I wanted. The product manual states that one hair removal pad is good for 30 uses. That may be true. However, with my experience with the product, it worked very well and quickly the first go around and if you used the same pad a second time [it took me] it can take 30 minutes to one hour of trying to remove a small area of hair with poor results. If you bought a bundle of replacement cartridges and changed it every time the pad wore out it would be a good product."
1,Ouch,"I found this to be an entirely useless product. You are more or less SANDING YOUR SKIN! And when I say sanding, I don't mean like microdermabrasion. Pointless, painful, sanding of the skin. It does sand the hair down, but not any different than shaving does and it grows back just as fast. Don't waste your time or money. Buy good wax and a warmer instead!"
3,great on arms not on legs,This is great on fine hair and rough spots but for thicker hair it leaves you feeling like you still need to shave.
1,Sham,"This sander barely did more than sand my legs. If I persisted long enough to actually remove hair, I paid for it for the next few days with sanded skin."
3,SO FAR SO GOOD,"I PURCHASE THIS ITEM 1 MONTH AGO AND USE IT ONCE IN EVERY WEEK.AND I THINK IT DOES IT JOB QUIET WELL ONLY ON LEGS NOT WORK ON ARMS MAYBE I HAVE VERY THIN HAIRS ON MY ARMS. THIS IS A REALLY TIME CONSUMING MACHINE IT TAKES ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO REMOVE HAIRS ON LEGS.ANYWAY I AM ENJOYING WITH THIS HAIR REMOVING SYSTEM,GOOD PURCHASE."
1,Not for me,"I don't like it! If you have sensitive skin, beware! It burns your skin. I didn't press hard, just followed directions.Not a fan."
5,A perfect song to listen to on the way to church,"I really like this CD, and all of Dino's other CDs. It's a shame he's not well known outside of the Heartland."
1,defective,"One mostly empty of fluid, one okay...very unreliable. No telling how long the good one will last . . . . . ."
2,compact design suffers from poor quality control,"Red reflector panels are a cute idea that works ""okay"" but not a big improvement over normal vial.I ordered two packages and both came with one good unit and one unit missing fluid.I am still waiting for response from Hoppy about correcting this.Better to buy locally as your own QA inspector."
2,Died after less than 2 years,"After initial enthusiasm about the design of this hub, I found that it underpowered my iPad or iPhone 4. After being connected all night, the iPad or iPhone would read ""Not Charging"". According to Apple, even a powered USB hub can provide much lower power than the external AC adapter provided with the devices. That certainly is the case with this hub.Then one day, the hub suddenly died. No more green lights on the ports. Disconnecting and reconnecting AC power had no effect. Time to buy another hub, and it won't be this one again.Another nit would be the included ""fly light"", which is cool except that it lacks a switch, so the only way to turn it off is to disconnect it, making it relatively useless."
3,OK,Seems to work ok. There is something loose rattling around inside of it though. Hasn't yet affected the performance.
4,"great hub in almost every aspect, except that ...","there is no way I can figure out the polarity of the DC power supply plug!!!!--- I lost the orginal power adapter and need to get a replacement, but in the tiny jack where you plug in the power supply, there is no mark of either voltage or polarity! (of course, searching their website or through the web didn't produce any thing.)Darn!So if you are forwarned to take note of the power adapter specs, just in case you might need it some day later."
1,Hub USB port Do Not Mirror Computer USB port,I purchased the Kensington HUB expecting all of the USB ports on the HUB would mirror the computer USB ports. Found that neither my iPhone nor my HP Simple Save work when attached to the HUB. Service tech department at Kensington suggested I read the specs a bit more closely. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates I should have expected any limitation to the capacity of the HUB ports.
2,"Would be great, if it was reliable","I shopped around and this looked like a decent looking hub that met my needs (powered, 7 port). I needed to plugin 2 external drives, mouse, scanner, 2 ipods and sometimes my cell phone or camera. I found that my mouse would stop working from time to time. Power cycling the hub helped. Worse than that was running a VM (via VMWare) stored on the USB drive. Speed wasn't so bad, but after a while, VMWare complained the drive wasn't available. Sure enough, it wasn't mounted anymore. After putting up with this for a few months, not being sure what was at fault, the hub quit altogether. Kensington replaced it under warranty, but the new hub also showed the same issues with the drive. I have none of these issues plugging directly into my computer. I'm fed up and cannot recommend this! I'm shopping for something more reliable!"
2,Nice Design but Fail Quickly,"I bought this unit because of its good looks, and indeed it has a better form factor than many other boxy USB hubs you could find. After I got the unit, it took me 10 minutes to get it working (which is believed to be some internal wiring issue of the hub), after 3 months, the unit failed miserably. Had it not had the good looks, it would have got 0 stars. :)"
5,Great hub,"The Kensington hub is a great thing for the computer. It's really cool looking and it works great. Overall it's pretty good. However, I just wish the light was a little bit brighter!"
1,Unreliable,"I had this for a short while before it broke. It didn't last six months.This was under light usage. It was put behind my desktop monitor, in a spot where it had plenty of room.The ports, however, stopped working one by one.It is unreliable.And the ""light"" that plugs in at the top is useless. Pretty, but doesn't throw off as much light as the customer photo that is shown. The light appears at the end of the Flylight, but does not shine far or bright. You'd get better light using a backlit keyboard or even a lit flash drive plugged in as this FlyLight doesn't throw off any light.Do not waste your money!"
1,DOA out of the package,"Very disappointed to find it dead on arrival right out of the package. No power led, computer did not find it, etc. It's totally dead. I also don't understand why the power plug and cord are on the same side as the usb ports. So if I want to plug in usb devices, I have to have the cords wrap around the hub. Or to have the cords go back off my desk away from me, I have to plug in usb devices into the back (away from me) of the hub. Which means I have to turn it around to plug something in and then turn it back around to keep the cords from wrapping around the device. A very poor design.It's going back and being replaced with a different brand."
2,Meh.,"Pros: Good weight, easy to use.Top port useful for flash drives, etc.Cons: Mine died after a month of useBuilt-in, super skinny USB cable looks fragile -- if the cable wears out, the hub becomes useless!I didn't care for how much the ports on the back flared out."
2,"Works well, while it lasts...","I bought this in January 2009, and now, November 2010, it's heading to the electronics graveyard.It generally worked fine while it lasted, though it's not the best design. With all the ports on the back, it's a bit difficult to insert the USB cords without turning it around, and with most of the ports in use, it can sometimes be difficult to turn the thing around.I'm sick of products that don't last, so I will not purchase this product again."
5,A keeper,"I have used different hubs over the years and find this one to be well built and reliable. This is not a fancy piece of equipment but it this day and age, to have something do what it is designed to do reliably is in itself amazing. But Kensington's Dome hub does just that. Other reviews have complained about usb cords not staying plugged in the usb ports. I have not had any such problems. I also like the weight of the hub. It stays where you put it. In short ""It works well""I plan to buy another one in the next few weeks and would definitely recommend this to anyone."
3,Stylin' but not Terribly Secure,"This unit looks good and has nice weight to it, but the ports, which end up being on both a curved and slanted surface, do not make for particularly secure connections. One out of 10 times a USB cord connection will have to be jiggled to re-establish contact."
3,Large Surprise,The hub works perfect as intended and the free USB light is a plus. The only problem I have is that I wish I knew before ordering that it came with such a large power adapter.
5,BUY IT.,The thing sits on my desk at home on a cluttered surface and it has all ports full. It just simply works. Excellend product.
5,Kensington USB 2.0 Dome Hub,I like it. Works good with my HP Laptop and all the USB gadgets I have.I like the handy USB Snake Light that came with it too!
5,Great Hub,This is a great little USB hub. I use one with my Mac and another one with my PC. They both work great. They are powered and come with a free USB light. I definately recommend this great product.
4,Nice Hub,At first I didn't think the hub worked as it wasn't recognized right away. Acouple hours later when I came back into my office to use my computer it was fine. It is probably some sort of issue with my computer and not that of the hub. I like it. It's form enhances its function.
1,"Looks cool, but...","This hub looks amazingly cool, but the built-in USB cable is extremely short. Unless you're planning on having the hub in the immediate vicinity of your PC, go for something that the USB cable can be swapped out on.Also, mine failed spectacularly after about two years of use. It went from working one morning, to not working that evening. In fact, it prevented my PC from booting up - the PC would get to the part of its routine where it sensed USB devices, and would stop right there.If you want your money's worth, look for something a bit more reliable than this item."
2,not as good as my original,"Although the same make and model, the Kensington 7 port hub does not work as well as my old original."
1,Kensington Domehub,Product received defective. Sounded like a good idea - never got a chance to use it!!!
1,Stopped working within two months,"This thing is junk. In fact, I suspect any hubs greater than 4 ports are junk.Stick with 4 port hubs. These things can't handle the load."
2,"Works great, but does not last!","I purchased the hub in september 2006 and it has worked great until it suddenly died recently on april 1, 2008. So it lasted for about a year and a half, which is better then some of the other people who bought it. I would've given this hub 5 stars if it was only more durable. Do not expect this hub to last more than 1-1.5 years."
2,Died,"Looks cool. But - unexpectedly died on me just as I was coming to rely on it. The comment about plugs not staying in is true, I too witnessed that, but was able to live with it."
4,Very Convenient USB Hub,Set up was easy. Speed is excellent. Having the main ports around the bottom and the seventh port on the top makes it very easy when connecting flash drives because the USB dome doesn't slip around. Having seven extra ports is also very convenient because of all the devices that require USB connectivity these days. I would recommend this product.
4,Great Purchase!!,"This product is as described by manufacturer. It has seven ports that all function properly, and it looks sleek on top of my desk. It does not move thanks to its weight, so it is very convenient. I am not too fund of the free lamp, given that it does not light up a whole lot, but you can always unhook the lamp and use that USB port for something else. I think the product is worth its price and recommend it without hesitation."
2,Not the best,"Good concept, however some of the ports dont work all the time and I have to keep changing ports to get things to work. Definitly not high speed as I keep getting messages that my printer, scanner, etc. will work faster if I plug them into a high speed port."
1,No juice from this Hub,"This USB consistently is underpowered. I get the response the hub does not have enough power to support the iPhone, or too much else."
2,A couple of more duds,"I just wanted to weigh in and say that here I am still buying USB hubs because this particular model has failed on me a couple of times like it has for the other reviewers. So I have two useless ""flylights"" and two broken USB hubs. Great form factor until it just stops working, then into the landfill it goes."
3,Plastic scares me,"FEELS CHEAP!I guienunly fear that irregular\regular florida influx of heat & humidity will slowly depleat the Kensington DomeHub 7-port USB 2.0 hub slowly to a small useless hub with an atatched & included usb FlyLight. great idea, I really have little positive feedback!!!!Bummed in that 34 bucks for weak grade plastic computer hardware is marketed to amazon customers!"
2,Stopped working after 1 year of use,It stopped working after 1 year of use. It just turned off one day and had no power. Other than that I liked it.
4,Plugs don't stay in,"It's very cute, and I like the way the LEDs light up when something is plugged in and blink when data is going through. However, I have a few complaints.1) The plugs don't go all the way in because the ports are set parallel to the base, not perpendicular to the surface. One side of the plug is seated all the way, but the other side isn't.2) Plugged-in items slip out easily. The hub is behind my monitor where nothing moving touches it, yet I occasionally find that my printer is offline because the plug has slipped out of the hub."
1,Great design....nice and heavy....now if it'll only last more than 3 months at a time.,"I'm on my third DomeHub...THIRD. These things burn out quick. And its not just my computer or AC outlet. 1st burnt out with my computer, 2nd burnt out on my netbook at someone's house.I can't these things."
4,usb hub review,"works as it should, the little extra light that comes with it is cute,good nightlight, plugs in to the top port well, the only draw back is the connection to the computer is too short, you can hardly sit it on the desk top, would be great if you sit your tower on the desk, i know you could buy extention, but why should we? also weighted which is good, probably wouldnt buy this one again."
3,Nice Hub but didn't do exactly what I expected,"It's a nice looking, heavy, and very usable hub but I have one problem with it. Devices plugged into it are powered even when the Hub's power cable is not plugged in (which means that their only being half powered anyway).My idea was that I would have multiple devices plugged into the hub and then have the hub plugged into it's own power switch where I could turn them all on or off at the same time with the flick of the power strip switch.I like it and it has come in handy for me but I just wish that if it wasn't receiving it's power source that it would not allow any plugged in usb devices attempt to power themselves off of the computer's bus."
1,Malfunction after 5 months,"I have never imagine an simple device such as an usb hub can fail. However, mine failed..."
3,Refurbish?,"I ordered 1 set, when I opened it, it had lots of scratches. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement but it came with scratches as well..."
4,Heavier is better,"I had narrowed my choices down to the Kensington brand, either this Weighted DomeHub (K33118) or the (non-weighted) Portable PocketHub (K33366). I absolutely recommend getting a WEIGHTED usb hub. This DomeHub has 7 usb ports, so if it wasn't weighted down then it'd probably be tipped over alot. It was a piece of cake to install the hub on my laptop. It plugs in to an outlet, so the devices I connect to it aren't sucking power from my computer. It came with a ""free light"" which is a light you plug into a usb port on the domehub, but I don't find it very useful.KENSINGTON Dome Hub 7-Port USB 2.0 HubKMW33118 - 7-Port USB 2.0 Dome HubKENSINGTON Dome Hub 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub"
4,Finally,"Finally found USB hub that doesn't slide around once other things are plugged. Came with this cool light that I haven't found much use for yet, but it's still cool."
5,"""Beast"" One Of The Best Ever","I am buying this mainly for ""Beast of Yucca Flats."" The other ones are all very funny too, but Beast is classic. You won't believe how it's filmed. You never see any of the actors talk, whenever someone speaks the camera turns away from them from what I recall. Tor Johnson is awesomely bad as usual. Also, ""Progress Island USA"" is a great short, one of my faves out of all of the shorts. It's a travelogue about Puerto Rico, and you'll be saying, ""OK! We'll move there!!"" for days after you see it. For newbie fans: these are hilarious. Watch with a group!"
3,WARNING: Bad pressing of two of these discs!,"I was very excited when this set was first announced, since all four of these episodes are ones that I've been looking forward to having good copies of for quite a long time.Imagine my surprise when I popped in 'Lost Continent' and 'Beast of Yucca Flats,' and discovered that BOTH of these DVDs have worse glitches and scan lines than my old VHS copies!!! I'm not expecting Blu-ray or anything, but quite frankly, somebody in quality control majorly dropped the ball here, and they can't blame it all on bad master copies, since some of the glitches occur during the brand new intros and host segments!Here's hoping Shout! own up to their mistake and we get a recall announcement soon.In the meantime, for those of you who haven't already pre-ordered, I'd advise waiting a few weeks to see what develops."
2,Not really worth it...,"I was glad to see other reviews here mentioning the issues with 2 of the episodes on this set-As mentioned before, ""Lost Continent"" looks terrible, with a disclaimer before the episode that doesn't quite account for the poor picture quality. ""Beast of Yucca Flats"" also has odd video glitches through portions of both the episode and the bonus materials. I have watched the other two episodes and they are up to the usual standard. I love Shout! Factory, but I have to admit that it simply isn't worth the $40.00 price tag for this-I could understand ""Lost Continent"" having master tape problems, but the ""Yucca Flats"" thing appears to be Shout's problem. It's a shame, because the set itself is nice (the artwork, bonus features, etc.) but I'll definitely hold off on buying future sets until I read reviews after they're released. Again, i think Shout is a great company, but this is really a mess."
5,great present,"I bought this as a birthday present for my son. He is so happy with it that he requested another set for Christmas. With the list of movies he wants, I think I have to get several, and probably will. As he said to me after he watched it ""Mom I laughed my A$$ off."""
4,Another great set from MST3K,"This is another great collection from the folks at MST3K. Jack Frost was always a big favorite of mine, and it was great to watch it again. The riffs are great as always, and the host segments are funny as well."
4,A musical history passport,"It's a shame that the strong, native culture of African slaves was broken, beaten, dissolved, dissoluted when they arrived in the US. This is a CD that works both in and out of the classroom. The music is amazing, and it makes you want to take an historical tour."
1,For who For what? Why?,"I am a well read individual especially when it comes to former athletes life stories. Jim Brown had a great book, Bill Russell had an even greater book, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's book was a treat, but what the hell is Ricky talking about? Despite the fact that this book was undoubtedly written by a 5th grader, it lacked any excitement or substance, and the amount of explanations in parenthesis was insane! It would have been wiser to write two books, one in plain English, and the other to translate the first one. A real bore. And as far as the rap goes, Jay-Z has nothing to worry about!"
4,A very helpful guide to signals and systems in MATLAB,"I used this book in a course that had for its textbook Signals and Systems by Oppenheim and Willsky. While I wouldn't recommend trying the problems without a good understanding of the underlying concepts, the MATLAB commands themselves are very well explained, and the instructions very straightforward."
1,Not useful,In my opinion the book doesn't teach you anything. The material it presents is vague or not helpful. I would not suggest this book to anyone. All this book does is simply present you different MATLAB commands and how there syntax works. Seriously a Google search would do you 100 times better and be way more efficient then dealing with this waste of money.
1,worthless.,"I used this book for a discrete-time linear systems class. The book gives no help towards understanding the material at all. The ""tutorials"" in the beginning of the chapters are a joke, and even if you have a good understanding of MATLAB it's hard to figure out what the question is even asking you to do. A few times I was stuck on a problem for several hours only to find out that I already knew how to do the poorly worded question.Complete waste of time and money. I got nothing out of it and neither will you. I know most of you have to buy the book for school so I'm sorry for that."
1,terrible matlab book,"I am a third year electrical enginering student. I have just begun using matlab quite often and I had to buy this book for one of my classes. This book has offered no help whatever-so-ever. It contains almost entirely all problems with no help on how to solve them. A terrible waste of money, look elsewhere for help with matlab."
2,Audio quality not up to standards,"The DVD is excellent; however, the audio quality lacks . . . and that's what a music video is all about."
1,Not the original,"Clearly from the picture above this is NOT the original 1995 Bandai toys when they first came out!1. Notice that the gloves are a velvet material. There was no such thing.2. The 'Sailor Venus' tape with the red lettering was never on the original box. Also the ""tape"" is centered right below the skirt where the legs connect.4. Why is sailor venus wearing RED boots?5. The box says ""Deluxe Adventure Doll"" these are the 11"" dolls.I own the original Sailor venus and clearly it looks absolutely nothing like this version shown above. This is not the original 6 inch dolls."
2,Sent it back,"Shipping was sufficent but I ended up sending this item back for multiple reasons. Not only was the box it was shipped in damaged, but so was everything inside. It all looked very used. The poolstick had a chip in it, the divider within the case that held the poolstick was broken and shoved to the side, and the accessories that were in a bag looked like a dog chewed had it up. The entire order had the appearence as if was stored in an attic, then poorly refurbished."
2,"Very basic, with no real focus on B&W photography","I bought this book in the hope that it would teach me something about Black and White photography. Unfortunately, I found the book to be extremely basic and more of an introduction to general photography than specifically about B&W. In addition, it was extremely dated, containing little information for a new SLR user.If you want a simple introduction into photography in general, I would recommend checking out books by Lee Frost - ""The A-Z of Creative Photography"" and ""The complete guide to night and low-light photography"".I would appreciate any suggestions for good B&W photography books."
2,lot of gibberish,"To me the title of the book is not justifiable. maybe one chapter was all I needed out of the book. I didn't need darkroom techniques which the book should be titled. There was not enough information about the camera and how to take good pix.. It was not a good reference book for me.I believe the book mught be good for a beginner, but I wouldn't advise him to get it...there are better ones on the market today.There was not enough about lenses, stops, flashes, lights,etc..Too much on how to load your camera and where the buttons should be.Yes, there are better ones out there.Read my other reviews on other books."
4,Film Photography Basics,"This book is very helpful for those interested in photography. Especially film photography, but the earlier chapters are good for any photographer. It explains the basic principles of photography, as well as gives a good composition foundation. A worthwhile purchase."
5,bananas,"i witnessed the fine musical talent of DBB [...] in 1999, and was blown away in the little venue, a similar recording of the tracks on this disc are bringing flashbacks! this album is pumpin with great music, the horns are crucial and do the job right! AMAZING!!!!!"
4,Great testing tool,Paladin Tools 1574 LAN Cable Check for Testing UTP and Phone Patch Cables and Installed CableGreat product...came in very handy for a wiring job I did for a school.
5,Works as advertised,No complaints about this. It's a very simple tool that works exactly as advertised. I like the carry pouch that comes with it. It has come in very handy as I have been building a network at my church.
3,Works fine but nothing special,"Works fine but nothing special, does what the other $8 cable testers do... it tests for connectivity but not signal quality."
4,No Remorse,"The Collar: A Novel of Abuse in the ChurchAs a Christian, It was hard to swallow what I have read in this outstanding story told by Mr.Lewis. To think that someone you could have so much faith in, could tare you apart by lying to get what he desires, and for one to be so nieve to believe in such,. and to have a loved one back him up knowing his evil ways. All I can say is that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Fisher... My hat goes off to you for the work invested into the ""Had to be told Novel""."
3,An average first attempt,"after reading all the reviews on here, I thought I'd give the book a try...it's okay, nothing special, rather soap-operaish- but no worse than any other others I have read in the ""romance"" genre...not very believable, however."
3,A Poor Man's Idea Of Noir,"""Grifter's Game"" is hardly bad. You'll find it sufficiently diverting while serving jury duty or on a plane. But it is remarkably derivative of the real McCoys (including Horace McCoy) -- James M. Cain, Jim Thompson, and David Goodis, among others.I agree with another reviewer, who observed that ""Grifter's Game"" is little more than a bloated and padded short story. I was also annoyed by a risible and quite literally unbelievable characteristic of the protagonist. And not only risible and unbelievable -- hackneyed even in the 1960s. I'm referring to the ""hero"" as not only attractive to women (fair enough), but downright irresistible. Yawn. I also hated the ending, which was extraordinarily ugly. Goodis could have pulled it off; Block failed miserably.Give this book a miss, and curl up instead with ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""The Killer Inside Me"", or ""The Blonde on the Street Corner""."
1,NICE TRY BUT NO CIGAR!,Block is a great writer but this early effort is as lame as it gets. Implausible and basically a 30 page short story stretched out.
3,Classic Noir with a slight twist,I love a great mystery and love the classic pulp stories of radio and print. This is a combination of both. While no mystery is present here the following of these two characters thru the seedy world of drugs and hitmen gives you a great feel for those early pulps. A few twists and turns here and there (I hate spoilers so don't look for any!) will keep you reading and this book is so short it will give you a few hours reading at most. Good but you defintly have to love pulp and classical writing. Reccomend!
3,A con is conned!,"Grifter's Game is a Hard Case crime series reprint of a book written over 40 years agol by Lawrence Block. Joe Marlin is a con-man, enjoying meeting rich, married women, taking their money, then moving on.Then he meets Mona. They sleep together and the next morning says, ""what are you doing with my husband's luggage?"" Days earlier, Marlin had stolen it at a train station. In the luggage was heroin and now Mona and Marlin must decide what to do. Meanwhile, Marlin is falling for Mona.This is a well-written story about some bad people, and that is the problem. No where in the story was I sympathetic with any of the characters. They never did anything that could be considered nice. Even evil people have good qualities, but Joe and Mona did not. Out of the four I've read, this was my least favorite Hard Case book."
5,"solid, edgy story of a crime of passion","After reading some of Lawrence Block's more recent books, I am not surprised at all by this excellent short novel. It reads very fast, includes well developed characters, and has that hard edge to it that keeps the reader rivited to the action. Our main character is a grifter who is always looking for the next town, the next con and the next woman to bed. He goes to Atlantic City and needs some luggage, and lo in behold, the bags he happens to steal include some illegal contraband. Then a woman enters the picture and our protaganist starts to see some odd coincidences. Will he kill for her? I was fascinated to read the outcome of this easy to read book, and try to outguess where Mr Block was leading us. The ending did surprise me a little.Considering this book was written in 1961, the sex and drug descriptions must have been pretty racy for the times."
5,Masterful Noir,"This is my second Lawrence Block novel, and I am falling in love with the guy. He's a great writer--spare, terse, and tough.The characters in this one are strong, and the plot is compelling. He's one of the great stylists of his generation, and other writers could learn a lot by reading him."
4,Quck easy read...,"Our ""hero"" Joe is a somewhat likeable con man who drifts around until he stumbles onto Mona.. the bored attractive housewife married to a rich old guy.. where have we heard that before... they go from a one night stand to joe wanting to spend the rest of his life with her in literally the turn of a page.. a bit hard to believe for a seasoned hard boiled con man.. a smitten school boy perhaps. Anyway Joe pulls off a well designed crime.. and what was interesting how the writer portrayed this type of character... lots of time on their hands..a lonely existence... almost bored to tears.. Bit of an odd ending for me.. but a quick read and overall worthwhile..."
4,good soild book,It is a interesting set of poems that can connect you into the person. It is a deverse consept.It is loded with poetic images.
3,Interesting tape,This tape is very good for a beginner. If you have never done stepping before then this is should be your first tape. But if you have even done one other step routine then you should probably not buy this tape. I bought this tape at the same time that I bought a Kathy Ireland tape and I thought that I was a beginner yet I enjoyed the Kathy Ireland tape much more. I had already used one step tape that came with the step that I bought and I would even rather go back to that one than do this. There is one good thing to this tape and that is the 15 minute stretch at the end with Jane herself is very good and I will at times put that on after I have finished using another tape.
2,Too Complicated,"I thought this video was really hard to follow. Granted, I am really uncoordinated, but the switching of instructors, the lack of a sufficient warm-up, and the complicted moves made me want to cry (out of frustration). The moves were never shown up-close when I needed them to be and then never done long enough at one time for me to figure them out. The last segment, however, was great. For about ten mnutes Jane does some great stretchs. She gives a lot of feedback and helpful information (where you should feel the stretch, where exactly the different parts of your body should be, etc.). Ultimately, if this video did not have this stretch component I would have given it only one star. It is probably a GREAT video for beginners, but I am new to working out and if you are too, then try something else (like Leslie Sansone's step workout which is easy to follow and encouraging)."
3,Low intensity workout,"I think Jane's first step workout is far superior to this one. In this tape the instructors change too often, and the workout is not challenging. However, the cueing is good, and I would recommend this to a beginner. For intermediates or advanced, this is probably too simple/repetitive and won't provide for a good cardio workout. I don't expect I'll be doing this again."
4,S**t Fire Good,This is a another great book in the Stay More saga. An author who has accomplished wonders in the the narrative form.I read TAOTAO in the Ozarks about 30 years ago and my reaction was the same when I read Confederacy of the Dunces while living in New Orleans. Mr. Harington is one of my favorite contemporary authors and the other one is John Berger.
5,A Visual Vibrant Feast!,Confronts you. Makes you feel so small. Makes you feel like the king of the world. So much depth.
1,Gross and stupid,"Beautiful if you think images of used condoms and girls with bloody underpants (yes, that's in this book) are beautiful. Shows how stupid people are willing to look to get famous."
5,David Lachapelle review,Absolutely amazing photography. He has a way with pictures. There is no real way to explain his work you just have to see it and you will fall in love.
5,amazing,awesome book with beautiful photographs. I've been trying to obtain the trilogy for a while and I am very pleased
2,Don't recongize songs in this tape!,My son and I don't like this tape. We don't recognize any songs other than the first one. Very disappointed.
2,Another professor publishes their lectures,"As a enthusiast and traveler of Spain for over 20 years, I looked forward to some unique and revealing insight in this publication. Instead what I received was more a kin to the compilation of the lectures I might get by attending Dr. Menocal's classes.The information is relatively well known and the presentation and chronology is caotic. Dr. Menocal recounts the history and personalities of the Iberian pennisula but to no purpose other than to say that it shows that different cultures tolerated each other, which is historically obvious.I rated it 2 stars only because it would serve as a good text book for a novice course on Spanish History."
2,Something is Missing,"The book is about court poetry, court architecture, court philosophy, and how well courtiers felt cultivating their court culture. It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture. The book is written by a bourgois raised and educated in safe homes and university bubbles but definitly not by someone who ever took part in creating culture."
2,This book is so biased,You can feel the bias on every page and while I'm a history lover(and I'm majoring in it)she makes it boring and she focuses on the more romantic part of the history and doesn't seem to dig deeper. I read this for history class last semester and it was pretty unanimous that the professor should drop the text from his course.
2,What is true and what is false concerning Muslim history?,I'm not sure I want to read this book after I read this article I found. It is basically called..'What is your child going to be taught at school concerning Muslim History'? Did you know that the Wright Brothers didn't invent flight? [...]
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"If you have trouble with Insomnia, this is a good remedy. Boring, boring and boring. If you must read this, stop after the flyleaf. Most of it is repetitive and uninteresting."
1,"Good Subject, Bad Writing","I lived in Andalucia for 3 years, finding the Moorish history and influence very interesting. Thus, I hoped to add to my meager knowledge of the period.Professor Menocal, while a good historian, is a terrible writer. Her sentence and paragraph structure at best is confusing. She should have asked for editorial review from an English Comp teaching fellow.I finished the book, partly because of my fascination with Iberia and this phase of its history. It also helped that I was on long intercontinental flights with no other reading material."
5,Great Informative Exercise Video,"Having been into exercising now for two years, this video has the answer to getting rid of most mens hardest area to tone...the abs. Very informative and after just a few days, I can tell when turning that my abdominal area is getting tighter. It flows well as the exercises change. Highly recommend!"
4,Bought ages ago.,"Bought this a long time ago, but it was what I expected at the time. Used it until I got bored with it and never got a sixpack..ha."
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this video as a compliment to those days when I work out on my treadmill to make sure all muscle groups were covered. I was extremely disappointed. The ab section was okay, but there were no tips on form or modifications shown for beginners. The arm section was dreadful. The movements were done too fast to provide anything but momentum. Again, there was no information provided regarding form or modification for beginners other then beginners were told not use weights. It ended with no stretching of the muscles which could result in injury. The background music was among the most annoying I have ever heard on an exercise video and the instructor appeared to be incapable of saying anything other then ""hey gang"" which he must have said 50 times during the 16 minute video...."
1,it worked?,"Okay, the music was bad. The blonde guy was bad. The instructor was bad. WHAT KIND OF RESULTS AM I SUPPOSED TO GET HERE PEOPLE? my abs are the same, and so are my arms"
1,Not so great,"When i received my video, i used it everyday for about 3 weeks, at the same time i went on a low fat diet as suggested and still the video did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I think i could have done a better work out. I am a professional dancer and do not think that this video is effective. Next time, i'll stick to a personal trainer. If you buy this video, you are wasting your money!"
3,Think about it,"I have this video for like 4 months now and I seen no results after 4 weeks so I quit it, The extersises are very intensive but its not for everyone. I am in great shape I got muscles and everything but not a six pack (ABS), the video might help you after you use it for weeks and weeks, gym is more expansive but its better, safer and you'll see the results quicker.I would only recommend this video to someone that has no time for gym or money."
5,A great abs workout,"This abs workout is a great supplement to an aerobic fitness routine. You must warm up and cool down by yourself, but provided you do that, the exercices are very effective and there's no time wasting. I've been doing the exercises most days for a few weeks and I can really see the results."
5,Great Workout!,"Got this video a month ago and have done everyday. I can already see a major difference in my Abs. The exercises are easy to do and ""painless"". I've been very pleased with this video and the results obtained. I'm 59 so this can work for all ages!Mike"
3,Good for weak days,"I prefer to push myself and do ab work on my own. I feel this video is too short to get an efficient workout. However, it's a great complement to individual ab work or when you are pressed for time and want someone else to lead you."
5,Buy this video - You won't be sorry!,I bought 8 Minute Abs after my first child was born it worked great to tone my tummy muscles back into shape. I used it again after my second child and again it is doing the trick. I tried machines at the gym but didn't get as good of a workout. My husband who is a body builder does the video with me and we recommend it to all our friends.
5,Awesome Video,Hey..... i am going to be a teen soon and i tried this video that belonged to my best friends mom.....i loved it! It is so fast and easy and the excercises are not difficult. My friend and I had been trying to do about 100 crunches a day and increase alot but i tried this and it's wonderful....i memorized all the exercises and do them at home.......i am going to buy this video.....it's good for beginners like me!!!!i hope you consider this video...its great!
5,Great for beginners.,"These workouts are definitely not for those ""No Pain, No Gain"" people. I love them because even though I was really out of shape, I could do them without being sore the next day. They are quick, and so it's easy to stick with them. These workouts give me a nice little energy boost, and I did see results after about a week. My arms are definitely stronger. And when you get to the point that one workout is no longer a challenge, you can do them back to back to increase endurance."
4,8 Minute Ab Review,I have been using this video for one week and I must say that I can see the results.
5,The most practical way to tone up,"This is an exellent way to trim and tone up your body in only 8 minutes time. My parents got this tape back when I was younger [I'm only 14] and I watched my mom do it all the time. But when I got older I started doing it and it was awesome my abs were actully harder and tighter then before! But unfortunitly the tape was recently eaten by my vcr, but of course I loved this so much I went on good ol Amazon and orderd the dvd package which includes 8 minute abs, buns, thighs, and arms, but I havent recieved it yet. But if your concidering getting this I highly recommend getting the whole 8 minute workout pack which I mentioned above because it's around the same price of this one tape but you get all the workouts on 2 dvds. Bottom line this 8 minute abs is a practical way to trim and shape up your body in no time."
4,Good ab workout,The abs workout is a good one. I do 100 sit ups daily but only 30 at a time and this work out challenged me. The arms part is not a good workout for me unless I use quite heavy weights and then there is not enought time to switch weights.
5,Jumpstart your Mornings,"This is a great video, Just 8 minutes out of your day to get you started in the mornings or afternoon. My whole family can work out together, I highly recommend this video along with 8 mins buns & thighs."
4,Great Ab Work!!,"I've bought this tape a few months ago and have used it everyday since I got it and my abs are really firm!! Jaime is great he won't stop talking throughout the whole workout, but that keeps you motivated!! no flabby abs for me anymore!! I went from a size 7 to a size 1!! I've also combined this tape with washboard abs, the instructor talks too much, but you can definitely feel your abs working."
5,Ab workout that really works,This workout is one that is proven to show results. In only a couple of weeks I noticed the results. Not only did I feel good about myself but other people noticed the difference and were very eager to try the workout. Since the purchase of the video I have tried everything including the Ab Shocker and nothing has compared to 8 minute abs. I highly recommend this workout and I believe that will will result in a very happy ending for someone who is seeking help in the ab area of their body. Good luck and have fun. It really works. You'll be impressed. Make sure you work out everyday. Remember it only takes 8 minutes.
5,I've Got My Own Hell To Raise,This is an excellent CD for those who love 60s and 70s style soul music. Bettye Lavette is an amazing singer and definitely underplayed on the radio. This CD is not to be missed by true lovers of old school soul.
1,Betty Lavette,"I had not heard her before, only read about her. I discovered I don't really like her! Just don't like the style"
3,In depth in some areas,"Great for perusals and a cursory overview. There were some notable exceptions to the 'greatests' that were highlighted... ""Godspell""??? It was still useful and entertaining."
5,Most insightful,"Margaret Barker has another direct ""hit"" with her Temple Theology. It was most interesting to read and provides a real insight into the temple roots of early Christanity."
4,Cute but small,This piggy bank is very cute but also very small. Perfect decoration though for a Winnie the Pooh room
3,Cute but tiny,"The ball is very cute, but the actual size is almost the same as the picture shown. It's very tiny, so I'm not sure how much anyone can actually save in the piggy bank. Seems it's more for display."
1,poor Quality,Although it will suit it's purpose I had to hot glue the top back onto the bank upon arrival. It's flimsy and poorly made.
3,Greyboy!,"Soul Mosaic is a really solid album front to back. This album is more soul, funk, r&b based. There are a lot more guest vocalists on this release than any of his previous work.If you liked 'Mastered the Art' for its mix of electronica head-nod beats and hip-hop, this new one may not be for you.If you liked his old acid jazz days, there isn't a whole lot of that on here either.It's definitely grown on me after a few listens. He has an impeccable track record, so the faithful should definitely check it out and see where he's headed now. It's good stuff!"
4,Benny's the greatest!,"My first thought was (since I was carefully listening to the lyrics) - they are all sappy love songs...but then, as Benny easily can do, I was taken away by his voice and completely lulled away. It is now my cd of choice to fall asleep to. It's not really a cd you want to do chores to, since they are way too mellow, but Benny's voice will take you away everytime you listen to it. Benny has a most incredible voice, I hope his next cd will be more like his older cd's w/some upbeat songs. Benny - please don't ever stop sharing your gifted voice w/the world!"
5,Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution,"I recently found out that my sugar was high during a routine visit to my doctor.They wanted to put me on medicine but I refused beliving that they had make a mistake with my test.After reading this book I decided to buy a glucose meter and test it myself. The results really scared me and I was determined to bring the levels down. This book gave me hope that Diabetes can be reversed or at least controlled without medicine.I am thankful that I chose to read this book and was enlightened by all of the valuable infomation that it contained.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been diagnosed, I consider it a lifesaver.Thank you,J. C.Fort Lauderdale, Fl."
2,I don't know if it's a good book or not.,"I was impressed by the ship time. In fact, I receivedthe book in less time than was estimated. So, good jobon that. However, when I recieved the book, I foundthat 10 pages had been torn out, of a pivotal section ofthe book, the section dealing with diet and control.The reason that I ordered the book to begin with. Iknow that you can't read every book that you have, but,this left me with a book that was useless."
1,Diabetes Solution - guess again,"One may as well stop living. Really did not think this book was wonderful for the average diabetic. Not many people will eat the way that is indicated in the book, it's almost impossible unless you live alone. Not worth the money at all."
5,Needs to be REQUIRED READING for all diabetics,"I have had Type II diabetes for over 10 years and have had the usual struggle with my sugar level. I was taking several pills a day, then added insulin to those a couple of years ago. But, since reading and studying Dr. Bernstein's book over and over I have gained full control of my diabetes and only need a couple of shots and 1/2 pill a day. My blood sugar maintains a level of 80-110 99% of the time now. I have read and reread this book and always find something new in it I missed the first time. Very informative, very easy to understand - I would recommend that all doctors read this so they can give the RIGHT information to diabetics! You will be amazed at what Dr. Bernstein has discovered over his years of research and learning with his own diabetes. Please please read this and extend your life expectancy."
5,The best of them all,"As a recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetic, reading Dr. Bernstein's book changed my life. I have an excellent health team, but the laymen's terms he uses to explain how diabetes works and his guide to monitoring blood sugars helped me understand more and be in control. His explanation of the lab tests make me a more informed patient. I have also read several of the other books available and found his to be the most understandable and most informative. His description of how he treats his patients gave me an excellent baseline of what to expect from my health care community (and was almost exactly what my doctor has done). If you are struggling with getting your sugar under control, get this book! and Thank You Dr. Bernstein!"
5,Tests say I am no longer Diabetic,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with diabetes. I was like a walking Krispy Krem donut. After folliwng Dr. Bernsten's advise, watching my carbs, doing my blood tests several times a day, following an exercise program, I lost 35 pounds. Last month when I went for my checkup, my test showed I was not diabetic. I know I am still diabetic, it's just I have it under control to the point my blood sugar level does not show I am diabetic. I bought 5 books when I was found to be diabetic, none of them gave the insight and understanding that this book did. Very easy reading, easy to understand, and gives you more of an understanding then most of the doctors you will encounter in your diabetic travels."
4,Great Book!,"Dr. Bernstein's book is a great roadmap for Type II diabetics to follow. The only negative is his promulgation of artifical sweetners, which are very toxic. I hope in a future book he would consider promoting natural healthy alternatives such as Stevia."
2,dibaetes book,"not much different than most...diets, etc...thought there would be a comprehenisve plan plus cho counting charts....really quite dissappointed....felt like I spent my money for nothing...."
3,Not so great minds,"If these are 30 ""great minds"", then God help the human race.Most of the viewpoints are very narrow, with the thinker projecting his or her specialized ideas into the future.None mention the most important influence taking place today that will shape the future.This is the moral decline occurring due to excessive materialism and commercialism.These factors are causing the collapse of civilization.Nobody likes a Cassandra, but I predict increasing breakdown: of societies and the environment."

4,Here is one by Avi that is actually pretty entertaining!,"Dreading a dull summer by the sea, Tony is surprised by a sailing adventure, sunken treasure, crooks, and a survival ordeal. EASY"
4,Windcatcher Review,"Tony is an eleven year-old boy who saves up enough money to buy his own sailboat, in the hopes to find a legendary treasure near his grandmother's home on the Connecticut shore. Upon arrival, he learns from a girl named Chris how to sail. Out on his own, he comes across a mysterious couple who are diving for the treasure to steal it from the state. They suspiciously warn him to get away. Determined to find out just what they are diving for, Tony continues to follow them. While spying, he is found out, and runs away, to find his sailboat missing. Lost at sea, Tony goes through adventure and pain to get home. At the end he is found by the couple who bring him to his grandmother's house. This book definitely makes you want to continue reading it. Although Windcatcher is not a lengthy book, it is an easy and enjoyable read."
5,Fourth grade male teacher likes Windcatcher,"I've read Windcatcher with four or five classes of fourth graders. They all like say they like it, and they aren't afraid to tell me what they think. Tony Souza is a boy we all can identify with. After we learn the sailing jargon, we get involved with Tony's adventures. We also flash back in time to the Revolutionary War era to Captain Ezra Littlejohn and the payroll ship that sank in the area where Tony's grandmother lives. Will Tony find the treasure, and what kind of trouble will he encounter trying?? Good book."
3,Windcatcher,"Windcatcher was an okay book. I think that it was a bit predictable. Avi always uses great descriptions in all of his books, as he did in this one. The ending could have been more exciting and adventurous. I really liked the setting, modern day, and in a small little place. Again, I thought that the book could have been a little better, so I give it 3 stars."
4,5th Grade Book Club,"Excellent book, except when it uses sailing terms, such as Starboard and Port. These words make it confusing, but it is a great book. Windcatcher is about a boy named Tony, who bought a boat called the ""Shark"" for his summer trip to Grandma Souza's house. Chris, Grandma's friend, gave Tony lessons how to sail, but he runs into treasure hunters so he looks for the treasure too. But will he make it? Read it and see for yourself!... What I thought about the book is it had a lot of action. Also, it is a very good mystery book... It was about a boy named Tony, who wanted to learn how to sail. As soon as he learned how to sail he got into a mess of trouble. I did like the book. I do recommend this to anybody who likes mysteries and is curious. I gave it 4 stars..."
1,One of Avi's Worst,This book's character was not believable. He randomly buys a sail boat when he is greedy for money. It doesn't sound like a purchase a kid would make.
4,Windcatcher,"While written for school age readers, this story will entertain all ages, especially those interested in sailing and summer culture. It is a quick and easy read. A great way to spend an hour or two."
4,Windcatcher,"A summary on the Windcatcher is quite easy to tell because it's about a boy that has no tallent, so he thinks. One summer Matt longhand made three hundred dollars doing yard work and ect. Every thing he wanted to buy his parents said no. At first he wanted to buy a gas powered scooter and his parents said it would be to dangerous. Until he saw a Sharktooth sail boat. That is where it all started. He took lessons from some girl down by his grandma's house. Then he becomes the first one in his town to sail to the across the island and back.Matt has short brown hair, tall and skinny and his mom has long blond hair, tall and skinny. His dad is tall, skinny with short brown hair and the trainer is tall skiny, with short blond hair.My opinioin on this book is read it. it is a very good book. and the reason I read the book someone else told me to read it and I did. So if it wasn't good I wouldn't be writing this summary if it wasn't good."

3,"A Cautious ""Thumb's Up""","Dr. Johanson shows both his strengths and weaknesses in this largely enthralling look at risks and rewards of paleoanthropology. His expertise in hominid development comes well-wrapped in the role of storyteller. And his experiences in the field are a story worth telling. Johanson disappoints when he steps outside his field of expertise. For instance, his chapter on radiometric dating is riddled with inaccuracies. And ""Is It A Matter Of Sex?"" is intrinsically flawed in its discussion of evolutionary ""strategies."" Overall a great book and a good read!"
4,Natural Capitalism Review,Must have for those who intend changing their company's overall strategy. Easy to read and applicable to daily life. This will be the next industrial revolution.
1,Natural Capitalism,"I had to purchase this book as a textbook for an environmental management class.It is my opinion that this book, and the class was nothing but leftist propaganda. It is all about promoting an agenda. Natural Capitalism preaches that we need to create artificial shortages, to ""fix"" manufactured problems. It does not explore in any detail the harsh, negative consequences that extreme environmentalism causes. I feel that it relies on the straw man argument.You will enjoy this book, if you do not feel that you should have a choice on where you live, what you do, and what you eat.If you can think for yourself, you will find this book disturbing."
5,A Revolutionary Book,"Natural Capitalism will change the way humans utilize resources. The authors make a compelling case for applying efficiency principals to a broad base of industries. When these principals are utilized on a broad scale, a host of environmental problems such as climate change and air pollution can be solved.CEO's of companies big and small need to read this book and apply its lessons. In doing so, they will increase their firm's profitability and make themselves more competitive in the marketplace. They will also take a giant step forward in healing our wounded planet."
5,A Must Read for Leaders in Business and Government,"Natural Capitalism is an exciting, optimistic, yet realistic portrayal of how humanity can reduce its ecological footprint and yet maintain, if not improve, its overall standard of living. I've been lucky enough to read a number of books that have had a profound impact on the way i view the world, and Natural Capitalism tops that list."
5,Mind Opening...,This book is not only eye-opening to the realities of the limits of our natural resouces it is also mind-opening to the business opportunities that are available if one is knowledgeable of where to look. This book provides a great framework for profitable businesses that are simultaneously good for the only planet earth that we have. I would encourage the authors to produce a more updated version with more recent statistics and examples. The framework itself is timeless though.
5,an optimistic vision of the future,I am about halfway through this now and I find the book very engaging and not difficult to read. I do agree that the current edition is dated.Kyoto costs too much? 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 is a pipe dream? This book will go a long way to persuading you that we will meet that target and more before 2050 and *make* money. The compelling question is - why aren't we further along in making the changes needed?
4,The next industrial revolution is Natural Capitalism,This book is what it proclaims to be...an introduction into the idea that the next industrial revolution will be capitalizing on nature. A must read for those in the environmental sector and a should read for others.
1,Shoe Laces,"Last time I checked, shoes laces are pretty basic.. However the color is just what we needed."
1,"Re-print of an outdated reference book, no current information","I saw the publication date of July 27, 2010 and thought this was a newer version of a book I already owned. I was quite disappointed to discover that the inside text was exactly the same as the previous version, which was printed in 1952. If you _really_ need a chinchilla reference, and any reference will do, this is one place to start, but if you are looking for recent information about chinchilla care and medicine, then you need to find a different book."
1,Greg Goodsell is correct,"I should've trusted his judgement. Far from a ""Something Weird""-esque classic, this is a complete bore. It's filmed like an episode of The Monkees, but with no jokes. Even the nudity is boring. BORING BORING BORING!"
3,It Certainly Was Murder,"I loved the setting of the story and Ms. Jordan writes quite ""English"" so the bits and pieces of the language were fun to read. I did not like having to pay attention to who was talking by glancing at the chapter page...and it sometimes confused me as to whom was talking to whom.The characters were not very exciting, but I did like Dee and Barry. They appear to live a happy existance with a smattering of fun and adventure added in."
1,Everyone loves a murder mystery at X-mas....,"but this is not the book. I could tell that from the beginning, Ms Jordan tells the story in the first and third person, often switching between characters until you are confused. She also begins explaining a setting or person and then rambles off into another story again confusing matters. The only thing missing is the story from the dogs point of view. I don't particularly like the ""heros"" Barry and Dee, they seem to gloat on each other a bit too much, and if you don't care much for them it's hard to enjoy the narriation. The ending was a bit out of thin air, including an interview with the Major that was dropped on the reader in suprise. I also found the relationship between Joyce and Gabe hard to beleive. Still I would to have loved to spend X-mas in a quiet B&B in England, even if there wasn't a murder."
2,I can't recommend this book,"It seemed to have all the things I'd want to see in a light mystery like charming inns and antique stores but it fell short. The characters weren't really interesting or likable and the point of view kept shifting. A good book should make you look up and realize you've read far beyond the chapter you had meant to stop at. It was all I could do to make myself pick it up again to read more and I could barely make it through a page or two before I got bored with it. I got it at a library book sale for 50 cent and I feel I spent too much. It won't be lingering on my bookshelf, it's going straight to the give to charity pile, maybe it will be to someone else's taste."
5,Allan W. Eckert,As expected from this writer this book is very good. For anyone wanting a history lesson of the early expansion of the colonies this is it.
5,"An excellent title promising interest for history buffs, photography and art students alike","Photojournalists have created and presented some of the world's most memorable images of events, and here to celebrate the whole field is PHOTOJOURNALISM 1855 TO THE PRESENT: EDITORS' CHOICES, which gathers some two hundred images from its entire history. From early snapshots of historic figures and moments to images of war and decisive moments, a senior editor of PHOTO DISTRICT NEWS, the trade magazine for professional photographers, gathers photos and makers based on critical reputations and historical importance. Each photographer enjoys a portfolio of representative images in full size along with critical commentary. Black and white moves into color images as eras progress throughout an excellent title promising interest for history buffs, photography and art students alike.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter 2 above the treeline,"If you are looking for a great realistic hunting games this is the game. Features and graphics are pretty good compared to most hunting games. Lots of locations, rifles,shotguns,muzzeloaders, archery and even a pistol. If you are looking for one of the best games there are buy Buckmasters Deer Hunting and Bird Hunter Wild Wings Edition. They are realistic and have great graphics. Lots of location and guns."
4,Joe Rocks!,"If you're a fan of Joe Bonamassa, this album is a fine display of his rock roots. While a fine demonstration of competent playing with cohorts Berry Oakley Jr, Waylon Krieger, Erin Davis and Warren Hayes, the material at times is a little cheesy.Having said that, the album still holds its place in my JB collection and demonstrates the formative years that led ultimately to the powerhouse playing that Joe delivers in Black Country Communion."
5,Joe Bonamassa is a god!,"This was Joe Bonamassa at 15-16 yrs old on lead guitar. The rest of the band and the band overall is decent. But Joe was defintely ""SMOKIN"" at such a young age. If you are a JB fan you want this cd. Praise Lord Joe"
4,very good service,"Very good service. item arrived on time and in good condition,,I would highly recommenc the seller...Thank You"
2,"Mediocre, 80's flashback","As a Joe B. fan, I was expecting this to be better than it was. Yes, it was his first ablum, but still..."
5,Goodamassa,This is really good . I bought it because it was the only missing record with JB in My collection and I'm really satisfied.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Great idea but rips towels. Doesn't come with the 100 towels as stated in the description. Amazon did nothing about fulfilling the order (I paid for shelf which included towels). Healthy shelf did nothing about sending the promised towels. FALSE ADVERTISING. Buyer Beware. Amazon, Target, nor Healthy Shelf returned my emails. Nobody stands behind this product. You are on your own if it is shipped and doesn't include the advertised features."
4,"Looks nice, not quite wide enough","We got this for the bathroom, and it looks good, is handy but we've tried two different kinds of paper towels and both are just a hair too wide to dispense easily from this. Doesn't look like something I could dremel a solution to either, we just make do. (works better if you only fill it about 1/3 the way)"
2,Looks cheap,"I returned this item, because the plastic looks very cheap in real life. Also, it really can't hold a very big supply of paper towels, and I don't want to be filling it every day. I would rather just have a commercial sized dispenser. It did not come with any towels, so I could not test it to see how well it worked."
1,Poorly Written,"While happy that someone has taken on such an important topic, I was disappointed to find this book so poorly written and so confused in its theoretical grounding. I cannot recommend this book to any serious readers."
1,Not worth the time! RUN AWAY,"If this is a rehashed version of someone's dissertation, two things are in order. First, the publisher should be ashamed for marketing this. Second, Mr. Brookey's advisor should be given a talking to. Brookey bites off far more than he can obviously chew with piece. Theoretical discussion is vague at best, and reflects just a mediocre understanding of the theorists he cites. Save your money."
4,"Size 6, Black Pu","The boots are just as advertised in the product description. As one reviewer mentioned, they are very tight, and you must have pretty slim legs to zip them all the way up. Even thigh muscles that come from exercise make these a bit of a tight squeeze. Remember, too, that if you're short, the boots will come up higher than they do on the model in the picture - above mid-thigh. One other comment - Since these boots are made of man-made materials, they are quite toasty inside. Your legs will sweat. Plan to wear them when it will be cold outside! Other than that, they do look just as advertised. We'll see what the reaction is when I wear them for the first time next week!"
3,DESIGN FOR SLIM LEGS & THIGHS,"VERY NICE PRODUCT, VERY SEXY WITH A TIGHT FIT, (PU) MATERIAL VERY SHINY WITH A SPECIAL LOOK.BUT DESIGN FOR WOMEN WITH SLIM LEGS & THIGHS.(PERFECT LEGS)IF IT'S NOT THE CASE YOU SHOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER TYPE OF BOOT WITH MORE EXPANSION AT THE THIGH."
4,Great boots! Be aware they are very snug though!,"I bought these boots for a Halloween costume of mine. I'm 5'6 and I normally wear a 7.5. I ordered these in an 8 and it worked out great. These boots come up very high on me: halfway up my thigh, which is what I was aiming for.As others have noted, these boots are very tight/small around the legs. I workout and stay pretty fit and these boots were hard to zip up until I got to the knee. They look great though, just be aware they can be difficult to put on."
4,I wish they fit me!,"These are great, sexy boots. Unfortunately for me, they were too tight in the calf and I couldn't zip them. They were just right in the thigh, though."
3,Definitely made for SLIM legs,"I'm an 8.5 so I ordered a size 9 Gold boots for Halloween but could not zip up my calves. Even if you dont have thick legs but a little muscle you're going to have a hard time zipping up. I exchanged them for a size 10 and it was still a struggle. I almost returned them as well and gave up but decided to squeeze my legs into them. The good news is that the material stretches with wear. If you have the time and patience, you can stretch them to fit well. I had to keep wearing mine around the house until they stretched out. They do look amazing if you can get them to fit!"
1,Not For Me!,"Purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots. Thought they would be the thigh highs I was looking for, just for casual wear. They were very large on my leg, and loose from bottom to top. Just didn't look right. They were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing. I tried them on several times with different looks but couldn't find a reason to like them. So, back they went. The shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge. Not a good looking boot, and I wouldn't even wear them for costume since they just didn't look right. Glad that others found them acceptable and that's all that matters. The silver ones appear to look great, but I now know how they look. Too bad...."
1,Poorly written,"This book is riddled with typographical errors that end up making examples and pseudocode very confusing. Sometimes it's a simple plus or minus sign, but once an entire part of a formula was left out, and at another point the wrong graph is shown. The stuff that is actually correct isn't explained as well as it could be, either."
3,did not use,"Got this book for a class that I was sitting in on, but the Professor did not use the book instead he used his own notes for the class. Therefore, I really can not give this a proper review."
2,Not one of DeMille's best,"The premise of the story is exciting but DeMille seems to be writing much of it just to fill pages. It becomes tedious. The story could (and should) have been written in about 25% less pages. Filling out characters and story lines only works to a certain point, then it becomes pedantic. I skipped many pages because they did absolutely nothing to enrich the story. They were just filler. One of DeMille' s earlier works so it can be forgiven. He's developed into one of my favorite authors, but this one missed the mark for me."
3,A Good Read If You Are Willing to Wade Through the Diatribe,"Although this is a good novel, it does have the flaw of an anoying continuing diatribe of gloomy pessimism about Russia and doesn't let up. Obviously I don't want to live in a Communist country and most readers do know about the lack of freedom involved in these countries. For this reason I did not score the book higher. It states the obvious over and over again. Otherwise it was an intriguing story and very interesting as it progressed. It could have been done with fewer examples of pessimism and pages . It was written during the cold war however, and this has to be taken into account. I still consider it a good read. When I re-read it I usually take a break and read something else in between but this is because I re-read the book. I didn't do this the first time I read it. I have lent this book to others."
5,I couldn't put it down,this book was great I just couldn't put it down. The whole time you read it you have to think what if this really happened and to an extent it did
2,"Slow, boring and not for me","This book had such high reviews, including a personal recommendation by a friend. I don't know why, but I just couldn't get into it. The pace was slow, clumsy and so full of Russian background I got bored. Quit after page 100."
5,"Excellent, Wonderful introduction to author","This was my introduction to Nelson Demille. I've read it several times over the years and it is still my favorite. I have to say that in all the reading I've done, Demille is the ONLY author I've read every title of his I can find."
4,One of the Greatest,"As a huge Demille fan I must say that this is one of the best books he has written.Demille combines sharp humor with suspene and a well educated background and understanding of Russia, its people and its culture. This book ranks as one of his best right along side The Gold Coast and The lions Game."
4,A great read!,"Once started, this book is hard to put down. Great escapist entertainment. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys espionage books"
5,The Charm School by Nelson DeMille,"Love reading a page turning book, plan on staying up all night reading or ignoring other things you have to do. Nelson DeMille has become one of my favorite authors grabbing me from the first page of his works. This book makes me wonder however, how many of our politicians were graduates of The Charm School!"
4,an engrossing read,"Unsure what to make of the title, I was unsure what to expect from ""The Charm School."" A bit to my surprise, the story started off quickly and gained speed right up to the end. Likeable characters and a powerful narrative catapulted the storyline along and left me wanting more.A book which could only have been improved upon with a more complex plot, this book is recommended reading for those who enjoy a good fast paced novel."
5,DEMILLE'S VERY BEST!!!,This is one of my all time favorite books. Great story line and so believable. I also enjoyed the insight into Russia's history and people. A great read!!!
4,On the whole it is a light and entertaining reading.,"The book has everything for one of its genre: interesting dynamic plot, evil bad guys, and charming good guys. The good guys are all believers in God, as good guys always traditionally are, though they have evident problems following His commandments.I liked that the author is not moralistic: at the end you understand that both good guys and bad guys are the same: none of them will stop before any crime for the ideas they think are right. Just don't get caught up in their crossfire. It's like in Orwell's Animal Farm when at the end it was not clear ""who's a pig and who's a man"".On the whole it is a light and entertaining reading.One last remark: to judge about Russia and Russians by this book is like to judge about the USA and Americans by the movie American Beauty."
1,terrible,"I have liked other Demille books like The Panther and Plum Island but not this one. The characters are superficial and irritating, the ending unsatisfying and frustrating, which just left me with a depressed feeling, and even though I can suspend reality frequently when I read, this book was so contrived it was hard to stay with the story. I felt I needed to state my opinion here because I was fooled by all the positive reviews out there and am sure others were also."
4,"Exciting and fast paced, iffy romance","I can't add much to what many other reviewers have said, but I was just a little disappointed in this thriller. I didn't give it 5 stars for two reasons: the disappointing ending, and the one dimensional character of Lisa. I didn't take off stars for this but as an aspiring novelist I found it odd that there were limited physical descriptions of the characters, especially Seth, Tom and Lisa. I thought Lisa was a simpering idiot and Tom's falling in love with her was unrealistic, explained only by the dearth of available single women. I also found that the rescue phase took too long. (I found the same thing in Babylon, so maybe it's me).The insights into Soviet ruled Russia and the threats that even those with diplomatic immunity lived under are appalling. DeMille does a great job of bringing that world to life. A very good read - Exciting, especially the beginning chapters,well written, a couple of cardboardy characters and a less than satisfying ending."
4,The Charm School,"A page turner even though it is a bit wordy, at times, and, in so many instances, unrealistic, including the female character. All that being said, it was a great story with a wonderfully interesting and different ""premise"". It kept the ""midnight"" lights burning for me."
4,Real Page Turner,"From the very beginning the suspense builds. First book I've read by this author but certainly not the last. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat until the exciting climax, If you like mysteries and spy stories this is a must read.Donna Berkowitz"
5,Very good read!,"I am loving this book! It makes you think, it moves at a good pace, and it makes you very thankful for what you have."
3,Too far fetched,"I like most of DeMille' s books, some more than others. Charm School is unique but it is a real leap of faith that causes one to suspend too much belief. There just was not sufficient touch with any sort of reality. My favorite DeMille is Night Fall, which is a good one based in reality."
5,Greatness!,"This book is one of my favorite books, and one of the few books that I have ever finished reading. It is a must read."
4,DeMille's Best!,"This book may seem dated - it's a novel set in the Cold War - but it's still a page-turner and it hits the ground running. As popular novels go (no, this isn't great and timeless literature), this is among the best. It has the fast pace and detail of Tom Clancy and the weirdness of Jerzy Kosinski. DeMille is a master plot weaver. A great book to take on vacation."
3,Charm School - gripping Cold War action,"If you're looking for a fast-paced, cut-to-the-chase, political adventure, The Charm School is a good choice. Readers who enjoy Tom Clancy and Frederick Forsythe will have a hard time putting down DeMille's tale of intrigue and deception set in Cold War Russia. The story follows a rough-around-the-edges American air force officer and a Russophile embassy worker as they delve into the mysterious death of an American tourist who discovered a closely-guarded KGB secret. The stakes escalate quickly, and it soon becomes clear that the future of U.S. - Russian relations may be on the line. But those looking for a happy ending, be warned: DeMille follows the events of the novel not to an ideal conclusion, but to a bloody and perhaps more realistic end."
5,top espionage novel,"I was holed up in an aunt and uncle's house in Canada, dead of winter, frozen world. All I had to do (besides talk to my aunt) was read this book. Locked myself in a room, and, boy, did I have the right book. Have read lots of espionage novels: LeCarre, Ambler, Forsyth, Fleming, Follett. This ranks in the top five easily. Avoids the ultra-cynical main character quality of some other DeMille books. And it's plot-driven, not wordy and overwritten."
5,POWs and the KGB,"Mr. DeMille returns to familiar ground - Korea/Viet Nam and the POW/MIA question. He comes up with an explosive combination that the KGB has brought these hapless Americans to a camp where they train KGB deep cover agents to be Americans. It is an insidious concept that has the ring of truth.This is a high stakes adventure where both sides of the superpower equation press the bubble to the breaking point. The constant danger is just around the next dark corner, and treachery is right behind.Another tremendous book!"
5,THE BEST OF DeMILLE'S WORKS,"OF all the books written by Nelson DeMille, this is the absolute BEST. Considering his other works are fantastic, this is quite a statement. Even the occasional reader will be UNABLE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!! You don't have to be a spy-thriller reader to enjoy this book. DeMILLE will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. IF THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK YOU READ THIS YEAR, READ THIS. IT IS GREAT. Once you do, you will want to read the rest of DeMille's works -- he is truly one of our greatest living authors."
4,This espionage thriller captures your interest & keeps it!,"This is my first DeMille novel and it was a great one. DeMille provides an interesting cast of characters with careful detail to setting. The climax comes within the walls of the ""charm school"" (where Russians are taught to imitate Americans). Although this is not my normal genre of reading, I found this novel to be a great choice and know that it will keep your interest."
2,Tepid Cold War Story,"I admit it: I'm baffled by the other reviews describing this book as a page-turner. I managed to force my way through the first 285 pages before I gave up on it, and skipped ahead to see if there were any interesting turns of plot that might have made it worth the while to keep reading. Nope, no surprises.I did enjoy some of the observations about Soviet life, which were interesting from a cultural standpoint. However, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the story moves at a glacial pace. There are many long scenes composed entirely of dialogue that doesn't advance the plot.As you will see by reading the other reviews posted here, most readers found something very different in this book. However, I found it much less enjoyable than a Fredrick Forsyth thriller, or even an Ian Fleming novel. It's just too bland to be interesting."
3,It was Ok,"I love Nelson Demille. He is by far my favorite novelist. However, I have never been crazy about the Charm School. The plot is cool and there are some really cool parts...especially the opening. However, I just never go into it. Fortunately, I stuck with Demille and read everyone of his books before and after. So, I am glad I read the book...it turned me onto Demille. However, I feel his others are better."
2,A mediocre read,The passage of time has greatly diminished the entertainment value of cold war era Soviet Union bashing. xxx xxx xxx
3,Good.. not great and too long,"I thought this book was good, but it surely wasn't as compelling as Plum Island or other DeMille works. I thought the ending could have included one or two more twists to break up the fairly predictable ending.All in all, I would read the book for its projection of Russian life and for it's qualities as a spy novel. However, this isn't one of my favorites."
2,Disturbing Finish,"Don't get me wrong about this book.I thoughly enjoyed reading about the first 400 pages (paperback), but the idea came upon me that it could not possilby have a happy ending. I was right.I put myself into the mind set of the author, diligently researching his material and saw the creeping issue about how to end the novel with all parties, particularly the reader, being happy. I couldn't. Once he set upon relating this tale, I guess he couldn't have a happy ending without it passing to the genre of fantasy.The reason I gave it so low a rating is that the author would have you believe that American intelligence services are more ruthless than the KGB. By far.If you can drop the book after the first 400 pages, do so.A disturbing book."
3,Charm School,I liked it some what but I missed the humor of Nelson DeMille's other books that I have read.It just wasn't may favorite.
5,A Charmed Life,I read a lot. DeMille is far and away my favourite author. I feel saddened that I have now read all of his. I must say now having read all of DeMille's stories that Sam Hollis was my favourite character.This story had an emotional ending and is not soon forgotten.
4,Fast-paced Read,I found the book extremely interesting with some thought provoking plots throughout. The characters were well thought out and presented and they had a sense of realness that kept me coming back for more. I had a difficult time putting it down and all the way through I was finding myself wondering if this could be possible. Really had me wondering!
2,Cold war thriller with stereotypical characters,"Demille's books are always a good read, and The Charm School is no exception. This is the first one I've read, however, where the main characters didn't have an iota of a sense of humor. (Minor U.S. Embassy characters were hilarious in during a farewell party scene, but that was the only bit of humor in the novel.The main characters are so serious, earnest, brave...and dumb. They do things that brave, serious, and intelligent people would not do. To think that an Embassy Air Force attache and a USIS information officer would not arouse KGB suspicion when they are doing essentially consular work (i.e. handling the death of an American citizen abroad) is just silly. What kind tradecraft is this?The ending while a cliff hanger is unsatisfying and not plausible in the era of Iran/Contra, Watergate, and other failed coverups. An interesting sequel would be the exposure of the U.S. Government's disposal of the Charm School and its aftermath."
2,A great concept that loses itself,"One of those long books that grabs early and devolves into ""oh, please"" plot twists that make you wonder if the last hundred pages are worth the effort. They weren't."
2,Not His Best,"Charm School was slow and dull--it reads like a second draft. The dialogue was stilted. The characters are flat. I kept reading only because I thought the book would get better; it didn't. It's hard to believe this is the same DeMille that wrote The Gold Coast, Plum Island, and The Lion's Game."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!,"Great book, full of action, suspense and humor, but it is also a wonderful, warm love story. I wish Sam Hollis were a real person. His intensity in trying to find the truth about the charm school and loving Lisa made him very attractive. I sure wish I had met him!"
3,Stick to Long Island,"I'm a fan of Demille but this one got lost in the translation or something. His Long Island ""Gold Coast"", ""Plum Island"" or Ohio ""Spencerville"" novels were much better. This one just seemed to go on and on. I stuck with because I knew he was a good author and it did get good at the end. Demille should have let Greg Iles write this one. Read Iles' ""Spandau Phoenix"" or ""Black Cross"" if you want to see how this should have been written."
1,Good idea for a spy story very poorly done,"A very fun premise. It was so fun, and the beginning of the book so compelling that I was caught up. I waited for the characters to come to life, waited for an editor's touch to enliven the leaden prose. After hundreds of pages, when Our Hero is up to his neck in trouble, I stopped waiting. I was worn down. I didn't care what happened next; it wouldn't be worth the effort of further suspending my disbelief. Verdict: a waste of my time."
2,Don't Read the Authors New Forward,"What was he thinking? He gave away the entire plot in the new forward. In it he also suggested that The Charm School was the best Cold War thriller ever (that's an eye-roller). Even if the mystery hadn't been blown in the forward, the plot is run of de mille (sorry). Another Demille book where a middle aged police/ military man who recently lost his wife attracts an attractive young girl with a daddy complex. Mrs Demille must be wondering what that's all about. Furthermore, all of the characters are jerks so it's difficult to care about any of them. If The Charm School were 300 pages shorter it may have deserved 3 or 4 stars."
1,"good for tinder, not much else","the horrendous quality of writing and nonexistant character development in this book completely overshadow the interesting premise of a russian counterintelligence school that trains deep-cover spies. set in the waning years of the cold war, the author creates fantastically awful, overbearing spy v. spy nonsense, offensively sexist characterizations of human relationships, and sensationalized visions of life in the diplomatic corps.a one word summary of this book would be ""pathetic."""
5,dave,"I've read all of DeMille's books and this was as very good. If you like his style, this is an earlier version and you will not be disappointed."
5,The Charm School,"This was the second Nelson Demille book I read with the first being the General's Daughter. I didn't think that it would be possible to top that book until I got two pages into this one. Great story, great character development, great book from the front cover to the end. One book that I can't recommend to enough people."
5,compelling and entertaining,Not the type of book I would ordinarily read. But it was impossible to put down. I would certainly rank it as the author's best. A 'can't miss' pick!
5,Excellent,"Excellent book could not put it down. The author does an great job with a fast pace and keeping the people 'real'. The book will make you think about what the government can do, has done, and will do. One of the best 'spy' and 'cold war' books I have ever read."
5,Best Demille Book,"Ive read almost all of Demille's books. This was by far my favorite. Wild Fire was close, but this put me in a whole other place. Strongy reccommend."
4,The Charm School,This is the first Nelson DeMille book I read and he has since become my favourite author. I first read this book over 20 years ago and rereading it now I have an appreciation why I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and wait eagerly for the next one to hit the shelves of the local book seller. He writes in a way that transports you to the places he writes about and you are not only reading about Sam and Lisa but you are right there with them.
5,Loved it!!,"Now really, who cares if this is reality, fantasy or factually correct! It's a great read! I look forward to more DeMille books."
5,Gripping,"The Charm School is the project code name to the project where young KGB agents are being taught by American POW's how to be model US citizens.And purely by chance, an American tourist finds out about this Cold War project, which sets off a CIA investigation.From the beginning, I remember telling myself to place myself in this environment, and to think of possibilities.Well, I also found myself feeling like I was there, in the midst of the drama, and having to think my way out.This story was so gripping, and it really is developed in a way that makes the ""impossible,"" and the ""well maybe,"" too close to distinguish the two.DeMille also developed the many character struggles so well that you had to feel as though you are part of the drama.And as you follow the story, you may find, as I did, that the last 200 or so pages moved incredibly quickly that you just could not put the book down."
5,A great book start to finish,The action doesn't stop and neither did my reading. I think I set a personal record for finishing a book so fast. DeMille really does a good job of putting us on scene in icey cold Moscow with the KBG at our backs. I really felt there with the characters.
1,wrong size,"One major problem with this item, where it fits the down spout it actually measures 2"" x 3"", not 3"" square. On the item it even says 2"" x 3'. I ordered it from 2 different suppliers, thinking the first one made a mistake, silly me, they must just read the computer and not look at the actual item. The companies seem like nice people, but the item is not 3"" square.7-13 update, they refunded some money, which was unexpected, as I told them I was dropping the complaint. People with integrity evidently."
3,Predictable but well paced,"The story makes great reading for technophobes, pursuing the idea that a shady team of master criminals could sway the stock markets in their favour via computer systems. The book is well paced but the conclusion is so obvious that the tension fails to build. The book, like so many of Crichton's recent offerings, reads more like a script than a book. Nonetheless, good beack/travel material."
4,We need more financial fiction like this thriller,"This is a super novel! Stock market junkies like me need more fiction like this. This shows the contemporary way to destroy ""the Street"": sabotage the computers. It is very suspenseful and you keep asking yourself: Could it be this easy? A frightening thought, especially with Y2K looming over us. I enjoyed this immensely and suggest it to patrons at the library where I work all the time--it has been a big hit. Must run and check the money under my mattress."
3,Far fetched but enjoyable reading,"Although the author does dabble in the realities of financial trading he overestimates the power and esteem of the various players as well as the impact they play on the market. The ""techie"" sections are very interesting and skim the surface of what is accomplished in the financial industry as regards technology and trading. I found the book entertaining but would not recommend it to anyone looking for real insight into the world of financial trading. It is a romantic look at a very rough and stressful way to make a living."
3,Overrated.,"I thought it was okay, but not the gripping page turner I had expected. If you haven't already read it, try Crichton's Disclosure."
4,"A surprising,and touching love story by anti-war writer","One of my favorite books (like Pride & Prejudice) that I have read again and again, throughout my life. Its a great love story that has a lot to say about how to live your life (focus on the important stuff). Try this book and get a nice surprise."
4,"1961 panther pb, back-cover:","WAS IT ENOUGH THAT HE HAD OBEYED ORDERS WITHOUT QUESTION?ernst Graber wondered as he lay in the Russian mud, the greasy stink of death in his nostrils and in his ears the roar of artillery and the whine of machine-gun bullets. And then out of the habitual sight of horror and desolation he discovered, in the passion of a brief tragic interlude, that there was love well as hate, and at last he found an answer....and a vindication."
4,this review analyses the ending too,"I planned on reading this book for several years. When I finally got around to it, with a fine old first edition from a used book store, I was at first pleased with the writer's style. The sentences were short, clear, crisp, and were an improvement upon Hemingway's frustrating lack of punctuation. However, in the last several pages my opinion of Remarque did an about-face as complete as that of the German army, for it seems that Ernst Graeber is offered as a hero rather than a traitor to friends and family back home. However this character was meant to be appraised by readers, we finally learn that a soldier who murders a comrade, frees the enemy, hands them his gun, and is shot with the same weapon in return for his kindness deserves exactly what he gets. I wonder if Elisabeth was eventually killed with the same gun."
1,useless,"There are no instructions on how to use this product.I sent two e-mails to the company asking if a tutorial was available but received no reply.consequently,the CD is a waste of money."
5,Excellent Resource for Understanding your Children Better,"Great book. Full of really useful information about your children's personality types. The book does a great job of giving detailed descriptions of your kids' personalities as toddlers, children, adolescents, and teens so that you can figure out what types they are.We constantly refer to this book as a guide to helping us understand our kids. It is invaluable for also helping you to learn how to deal with each of your kids in different ways. A really good buy."
3,Looks good,Cannot rate it as of yet as I gave it for a gift to my daughter who is a teacher and a mother.
4,The kind of day you can't open your mouth without a song jumping right out of it.,"This is a three disc box set of Disney music. The first two discs feature music from Disney cartoons, or live action films that featured animated sequences. The third disc features music from Disney live action films, television shows and theme parks. The songs from before the mid 1950s include whatever sound effects or dialogue that appeared in the film while the song was playing, sometimes to the detriment of the song. There are songs from almost every Disney animated film up to 1991, including the films the didn't have any good songs. But most of the songs are quite good, or at least fun to listen to for nostalgia's sake. If you are a Disney fan, you will enjoy this a lot."
3,interesting read,"I found Too Much of a Good Thing a pleasant, delightful read. Numerous stories and dialogues held my interest fairly well and I found the premise that we&#65533;re overindulging our children easy to believe. However, Kindlon primarily backed his ideas with results from one major survey and a variety of intensive interviews. Although the survey was impressive, little else stood to back his assertions. Of greater concern was the fact that he blamed both sloth (lack of motivation) and envy (resulting in pressured, driven perfectionism) on this same overindulgence without attempting to explain the apparent contradiction. Fortunately, I found the answer in a more substantial book (Hollow Kids) that explained how the drive to raise kids&#65533; self-esteem and make them always feel good can indeed explain this apparent paradox."
4,Facinating,What a fascinating read! I got it to help me with one of my papers but have ended up reading it for pleasure as well. It's very clear and well written. More parents should read it!
2,"An easy, interesting read, but ultimately shallow","How to avoid spoiling kids is an important subject for parents of teenagers who have the means to provide their kids with a comfortable life. Unfortunately, this book doesn't really provide much insight into the situation. It's full of contradictions and doesn't help you understand how to walk the line between caring and indulging.Many of the excerpts from real interviews with teens seem manipulative, with quotes selected to prove the current point the author wants to prove (which changes according to the chapter). What's lacking is any real context or analysis of the quoted teen's situation.Ultimately the book provides some food for thought, and can be read in a few hours, but it's irritatingly simplistic."
3,almost good enough,"This book touches on a subject but never gets past the surface. The content contains lots of interesting stories yet doesn't quite explain the reasons behind parents inability to set limits, to give consequences, and to be honest with children. I found these explanations fully explained, as one other reviewer noted in the recent book called ""Hollow Kids"" which is a more serious, well researched description."
3,This is Not Deep House,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers would consider true deep house as. On reading the other reviews there are multiple references to this compilation as a great deep house mix. Right genre, but wrong subgenre. I also disagree on this being considered a great mix. It is pretty average in my opinion. ""More For The Living"" by Members Only is a cool track but there are too many average house tracks with a couple of weak ones interspersed throughout the mix to considered this a great compilation by Kaskade. A nice listen by not one of the stronger San Francisco Sessions' albums.3/5 stars."
5,My son loved it.,"I bought this backpack for my son for school and he absolutely loved it. He is a huge Cubs fan. I was wondering how sturdy it would be with the price being so cheap. I am very happy that it was very sturdy. My son immediately put all his school supplies in the backpack as soon as it arrived. Very good purchase, can't beat the price."
2,Do you have a horse?,"If you are a Reiki practitioner and want to learn how to use Reiki on horses, this DVD would be just the one for you. As a newcomer to the healing touch of Reiki, I found that Ms. Milner assumed I knew more than I do so I was confused for much of the presentation. The DVD focuses primarily on a horse. There is a short section on dogs, but I didn't find it as helpful as I hoped."
5,Just What the Money Doctor Ordered,"Finally, Jean Chatzky's smart, fresh, relevant advice all in one place. This book is clearly the culmination of years of financial reporting both on TV and in Money magazine. Reporting that I have looked forward to over the years and am so gratified to have updated and put together so well in this book. For anyone who has ever felt confused or bewildered by the world of finances, or just plain disinterested, Talking Money is a real motivator. You'll find ways to take control of your financial life that you never knew existed. I did."
1,Less Than Meets The Eye,"If you already own at least one personal finance book then this mediocre one will not tell you anything you haven't already seen, heard or read.If you're looking to buy your first money book, then skip this one. It only gives a generalized overview of important topics and will leave you wondering ""What steps should I follow to take charge of my finances?""Go with one of the classics instead, such as Andrew Tobias's ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" or Jane Bryant Quinn's ""Making the Most of Your Money.""""Talking Money"" is just a lot of hot air."
1,Why Pay For Old Advice and Destroy Trees?,I've seen Ms. Chatzky on the Today show for years and years so I thought this book would be fresh and original. Gosh was I mistaken. This book contains nothing but the same old information that she's been eagerly sharing free of charge for years and years. (You can get the archives of these previous talks on Money magazine and the Today show's web sites for free!)She contrasts herself to Suze Orman who has also run out of fresh material. Unless these women can come up with something to add to the conversation they should stop writing books.
5,The ABC's of Personal Finance,"Jean Chatzky's Talking Money is a must-have for anyone who holds a career in financial services. I say this because, if you're like me, friends and relatives constantly pester you with basic financial questions that require more patience than expertise to explain to the uninitiated. Talking Money is a fine solution. Jean breaks down complex issues into fundamentals that are useful explanations for the beginner and helpful reminders for a more advanced financial planner. Her chapter on insurance is particularly strong. It was refreshing to read what I consider to be the true lowdown on insurance; typically, one gets nothing more than an inflated sales pitch from most insurance brokers. This book should be on your shelf, especially if you deal with financial novices."
3,Just another Personal Finance book ...,"Nowadays, Books on Personal Finance abound. This is just another book in the sea of Personal Finance books.The book walks you through the different aspects of Personal Finance right from setting your personal finance goals to executing those. However, the coverage of the topics is very shallow. The author rarely provides good pros & cons as regards to different choices that are available. Hence it just leaves the reader wondering as to what is the better choice..The only use of this book is to obtain the ""Table of Content"" for your Personal Finance pursuits. You can use this ""Table of Content"" to pursue further in depth discussion elsewhere.Rather than this book, I would recommend the following books for folks who are just getting started on the Personal Finance front ...=> The Wealthy Barber by David Chilton (my personal favorite)=> Personal Finance for Dummies by Eric Tyson-Sachin"
5,Great item for great price,"This is a great begginers cue, is has a good weight and lenght. It comes with a case and is the best price i could find online."
5,Postive Pushing Fantasy for a 15 yr Old Son,"What a relief ! My son accepted our switch to positve pushing -versus always being negative about his lack of effort. He seems more relaxed and less confrontational, since we have doubled our efforts and both of us have read Dr. Taylor's ""Positve Pushing-How to raise a sucessful child"". It has taken a huge load off of our shoulders, and placed emphasis on being positive but firm in our conviction that at school and home he can be a better person. Thank you, Dr. Taylor for giving us the insight into the power of being positive, continuing to always being concerned, and giving us the ability to help our teenage son is such a positive way."
4,Positively Helpful!,"As a parent of three (ages 2, 6, 8) who lives in an affluent suberb with many high strung, overachieving parents, this book was a refreshing push in the right direction. Although ""pushing"" one's children has gotten a bad rap, Dr. Taylor calls ""em as he seems 'em"" and lets us know that pushing children is fine, if done in the right way. Many of us push our children in negative and hurtful ways. This book explains how to push or encourage your children in a positive, non-judgmental way. Further, the book is well written and easy to read. It lays out Dr. Taylor's three pillars of successful parenting in a concise and straight forward way. I found this book to be very helpful. I will refer to it again and again as a reference."
4,The best boxer brief yet,"I am on a search to find the ideal pair of underwear, which for me is a boxer brief which holds tight on the waist and leg, with plenty of room where it's needed and that has some length. These are almost perfect for me. They hold up well, unlike the two other brands I have, which become very lose throughout the day. I even wore them for two days back to back and have sent them through the wash, and they hold just as tight as the first day. They don't bunch up on me, regardless what I wear. The only thing wrong with these is I wish they were a bit longer, but are otherwise a great fit."
5,Excellent History of the Zulu Empire,"This book is truly sprawling, interesting chronicle of the history of the Zulu nation. It spans from the rise of warrior king Shaka Zulu to the final destruction of Shaka's empire at the hands of the British army. While the sheer size of the tome may be a daunting prospect for many to tackle, the book will reward those who read it with a knowledge of the most colorful portions of African history. For instance you will be acquainted with the largest defeat ever suffered by the British army at the hands of natives. You'll also learn about the incredible stand at Rourke's Drift of 103 British soldiers against 4,000 Zulus. If you liked the movies, ""Zulu"", ""Shaka Zulu"", or ""Zulu Dawn"", read this book. Or just read it to know how events well over 100 years ago impact today in modern southern Africa."
5,The book to read on the Zulu Wars,"This is the ultimate work on the rise and fall of the Zulu nation. Morris gives a rich, detailed and quite frankly amazing history of Shaka's rise and the ultimate fall of the Zulu nation to the British. This is a long, exciting historically wonderful labor of love and a must read for anyone wishing knowledge of this fascinating period of history."
3,Military history only,"The author draws on extensive archives to provide almost an hour by hour description of the military conflict between the Zulu people and the British and Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa. The detail is sometimes overwhelming -- names of British officers, dates, etc., are not always readily kept in mind.Because there are no Zulu archives, the material on which the book is based is British record of the campaign, a record that contains some interviews with Zulus who were in the battles.Not in the book: an explanation of the Zulu economy and society that supported their army. The reader learns of the politics and economic constraints that influenced and limited the British side of the war, but the Zulu army appears on hilltops, spears and rifles in hand. We learn little of how they were supported nor of how they were organized to fight."
4,"Cuts 6, 7, 8 and 9 are masterpieces","Cuts 6-9 are masterpieces on this album. I bought every Shawn Phillips album ever made and could do without cuts 1-5 but 6-9 are simply stunning. Shawn's rock was never his strong point but when you gave him a melody, few were his equal. Throw in his amazing voice and fewer still could hold a candle to him. Many of Shawn's biggest fans feel this is a weak album but cuts 6-9 are so strong that many still give it 5 stars and ignore the rest of the album. Me, I give it 4 stars and never play side one. ;o)"
4,Reminds me of The Dead Boys...,This 1994 CD was their first of three albums. It's pure rock for punk purists. It reminds me of The Dead Boys at their best. Jesse Malin's sneering vocals even reminded me of the late Stiv Bators at times. I need to pick up their next two albums. These guys should have been playing The Rat circa 1980.
2,Don't buy!,"I can't understand the positive reviews for this turkey! I bought this when it came out, and it sounds more like Pretty Boy Floyd or Britny Fox than any glam-punk band I've ever heard. Even the band hated it! The songs as written aren't that bad; the production seems to be the culprit here. Four of these songs were re-recorded for their second album, ""No Lunch"", and the improvement is phenomenal! That album has much earthier production, and is better played. Avoid this, and get their other two albums instead. At least they actually SOUND punk! This band was basically an updated Dead Boys, but this album is simply 'Dead'!"
1,Complete disappointment,"The smoky, mysterious ambience of ""Songs From The Tin"" is completely gone. What appears to have happened here is that some entity-corporate or maybe (God forbid) the group-abandoned the sound in hopes of getting mainstream radio play and sales. This project has inane lyrics and unremarkable melodies. I listened to the disc several times to see if I just wasn't ""getting it"" but ultimately stuck with my first impression.I was very happy to see another release from Da Lata and certainly want them to succeed as artists. But I'm sorry I paid full price for this CD without hearing the disc first. Maybe a change back to their previous direction for the next project?"
1,Lorex Cameras Are Junk,"I purchased a L15LD420 surveillence package in October. Within 7 months the four cameras (CVC6993R) had night vision failures. The IRs would not switch on because of a mechanical auto IR filter cut failure. This is an ongoing problem with Lorex cameras (well documented in reviews of their cameras). You would be far better off with another brand if you want something reliable, which is an absolute for a security system."
3,Entertaining but Pinches,"My now 1 year old loved this since he was 6 months. Its a very entertaining toy and my baby learned how to push the buttons to make the bears pop out but when he pushes the bear back down into the box, my baby's finger would get pinched by the little bear's red hat. And given that my baby would bang the bears back down, he would hurt himself pretty badly. So, I made it a point to supervise him while playing with it and then i found myself not allowing him to do it himself (kinda defeats the purpose). I don't know when I'll take this out of the closet and reintroduce to baby or how he might react to it when he's older. It did serve its purpose when i wanted to entertain my baby when he was younger but then it quickly got akward when I didn't allow him to play with it as much as I was."
1,FRIGHTENING TOY,"The first reviewer was correct, this toy is dangerous. First of all, it makes a hideous, loud cracking noise every time you push the buttons to ""pop-up"" the teddies. My baby was frightened by the LOUD abrupt snapping/cracking noises. Secondly, fingers and skin will get pinched by the red hats. I would not recommend this to any child, at any age."
2,"Wonderful Bach, less pleasing Jacobs","Bach's cantatas are so beautiful but this particular recording doesn't do them justice. Instrumentally Chiara Banchini does a good job but Jacobs leaves much to be desired. His sharp and pinched - especially in the high regions - voice is discomforting. His lower notes have more warmth but not much is sung in that register. If you're not a Jacobs fan, don't be deceived by this set's affordable price and go for one of Scholl's Bach collections."
3,"A revised edition of the book ""Drawing Near""","I understand now why John Bevere reads his own books on his audio books; this book has been chopped up, parts taken out. It was read by a professional reader but was a revised version and didnt say so in the description. I wouldnt recommend it to a person who wanted the original unedited book on audio, but you may want it since it may be the only audio version of the book that you can find, which is true in my case."
5,LIFE CHANGING BOOK,This book changed my life dramatically! Through the teaching in the book it brought me back into full service for the Lord. I strongly urge everyone at any stage in their life to get this book. I have since purchased this book many times for family and friends!
2,Typo's typo's typo's!,"I love John Bevere's writings but this kindle edition is filled with typo's, wrong phrasing and word reversals. Very frustrating. Love the sample but I will not be buying this kindle addition."
4,Drawing Near,This is a good book. It makes you think about how we should strive to have a deeper relationship with God. The seller sent me a book that was like new even though they rated it as good condition.
5,A Must Have,"First let me say that I am avid reader of christian books, with a very extensive collection. This book is now hands down my favorate. Rich revelation, and the kind of book that just kindles a fire in you for the things of God. As soon as I read it, I started over again, and will do so again as soon as my brother in law finishes it. I have even infused parts of it into some sermons. I have become a real fan of John Bevere, have read about four of his books now, and this is by far my favorate. There are some books which give alot of great information, there are some books that inspire you, I believe this book boes both. This is a book that is really after the heart of God, and will remain on the top self of my book case for a long, long time to come."
5,Love It!!,I love this book. It has allowed me to establish a more intimate relationship with God. If you are in a dry place in your walk with God I highly recommend this book. It will help you take a journey to the next level with your walk with Christ.
2,Leaky hard to wind,The plastic valve to attach the hose to the faucet is leaky and no way to stop it. Cheap construction. Almost impossible to anchor down. Hose winds up very uneven unless your take it slow and guide it. Still better than hand winding. But I will replace it the minute I can find something that works.
1,Despite lots of research...dissapointing,"I was dissapointed in the availabity of sturdy hose reels available locally, so I went online to find the latest and greatest. Boy was I disappointed when this unit broke the first day I installed it. And I haven't been able to figure out how to make a warranty claim. Click warranty on their site only brings you to product registration. Ugggh!They haven't heard the last of me."
1,no more hose problem,"The hydro industries rs-15061 reelsmart wizard hose reel is a good buy for the money. It beat anything I could find at Home Depot,lowes and Walmart. I am going to purchase another one for my hoses in the rear yard."
1,"Picture is Misleading, as of April 19","Unless Amazon has corrected it by now, the picture in this display shows an enclosed reel with a hose guide that controls the rewind onto the spool. This feature was part of an earlier model that I purchased a year ago, and I liked it. The reel that I just received has the same model number (15061) but is not enclosed (the wound hose is open to the elements) and, more importantly, there is no rewind hose guide. The instructions tell you to guide the hose onto the spool during rewind -- much less convenient in my view. Also, the Amazon description says that it includes mounting hardware, but the recent model does not, and says as much on the packaging. Obviously, Hydro Industries has cheapened their product, but the Amazon description has not been updated -- buyer beware."
2,Works for a while,Worked for a few weeks. Now it is slow and weak. Wastes a lot of water. Not for serious gardener. Should be metal and electric to make it wind stronger and more lasting. Also swivel would be nice.
2,Another Lame Movie,"I purchased all the ""Spenser"" movies at once. That was a mistake as they were all Lame. I wouldn't even class then a ""B"" movie productions, but more like ""D"" movies. Too bad, as the novels are usually very good."
2,Does not meet expectations,"The first unit I received would only motion sense up to 30 feet, not the 60 feet as advertised. The replacement unit I received did the same. So if you only need the unit to detect up to 30 feet the unit works great."
2,Range limitations,Disapointed in the range from motion detector to lamp switch. Activation works at a distance of only about 3o feet.
3,Transition,"This song ""One"" is actually one of my favorites. But i must admit for this song to still be placed under White Zombie is not up to date in my own reasoning. In this song you can hear the transition and experimentation that Rob Zombie was going threw with electronica and getting away from the sounds you find on the earlier White Zombie albums. In my opinon if you liked American Nightmare or Robs use of electronica on BoogieMan then you will appreciate this Nightmarish pop song that Rob Zombie and crew have created for you but if you prefer older White Zombie sound then stay away cause this single would go more smoothly with the Rob Zombie cds."
4,Wise Book,"Beautiful sepia-toned photos focus the reader's attention. Some of the women in the book are well known, some are not - which leads you to think maybe you could be wise or courageous or beautiful also. Interesting quotes. Interesting book. I bought one for a friend. After reading it, I bought several more for myself and other friends."
2,Text good. Illustrations unworthy.,"I am disappointed. I feel the photographs are overly dramatic. Why was it necessary to drape most of the subjects in sackcloth? I feel the images are unattractive and distract from the narrative. The photographs, for the most part, don't do these amazing women justice; and the insights offered are tepid at best."
3,Wise Women,"I was somewhat disappointed, but I gave it to a very bright 85-year-old friend, and she absolutely loves it. I prefer I Dream a World, by Brian Lanker."
3,My Thoughts on WISE WOMEN,"It is a good book to refer to periodically. There are some ""wise"" thoughts in the book, but I expected a little more meat to the comments and less emphasis on the photography."
3,Value for money purchase,"Not exactly encore stuff as the record company would like usbelieve as a number of single releases such as Don't Answer Me andPrime Time have been excluded, while a number of album cuts fromalbums released between 1979 to 1982, when Alan Parsons Project weremost successful chart-wise, have been included. Personally, if theyhad wanted to fill this compilation with album cuts, I would haveliked The Turn of a Friendly Card and Old And Wise to be in. Thesesongs would certainly improve the listenability-factor of the CD andup the rating by another star. Still, there are enough big ones likeEye In The Sky, Time, Games People Play and Damned If I Do to motivatethe discerning buyer to part with $ for this budget CD."
3,music doesn't stand,"The stand itself is very nice. The stand part is stable and stands up well, but the music holder keeps falling backward even though it is adjusted as tight as it can be. It needs to be propped against something to hold a music book upright. It may be all right for just one page of music but I would not recommend it for anyone who needs to hold a booklet or music book. It is okay for the price."
5,Great portable music stand,"I've used portable music stands before - and this one is better than any I've ever used. Solid and easy to set up. Great value, it would be worth the money even withtout the very nice carry bag."
1,does not stand up to use,"I purchased this music stand for my daughter and it broke in two after just a few uses. The bottom of the stand and the part that holds the book came apart and it would have to be welded back together. It is not worth returning, but I am very disappointed in the workmanship of this item and would not recommend it."
2,Yamaha...,"The quality of the stand is fine but I think this is an ""imitation"" of a Yamaha stand.The Yamaha logo is no where to be seen on the stand nor on the box.I would recommend the seller to remove the ""Yamaha"" from the product title...because I felt fooled when I received the ""fake"" Yamaha stand."
3,Lasted 1 Year,"Pretty sturdy considering the price. Easy to setup and put away. However as someone else mentioned, it does tend to flop back at the top if not SUPER tightened. I need to tighten with all my might to have it hold up a book.Update - 1 year later: The metal wore out at the top due to bending the top part of the stand and it snapped. So it lasted about 1 year."
4,"Pretty big, sturdy, does NOT come with a bag","This is from an amateur perspective.Compared to some music stand I had before, this one is bigger. at the same time, it's quite sturdy and can hold a good amount of music sheets. i.e. it could hold 2-3 beginners music book without problems, but I don't see why more than one at a time would be needed :-)Many reviews mentioned a nice carrying bag coming with this. To be clear, there was no bag with mine. Amazon customer service was super nice and proposed to either return or get a partial credit, but they mentioned rightly that the description does not mention any bag.So basically, only reviews mention a bag.I'd give it 5 stars if a bag was included, as finding a bag to fit the dimensions of a folded stand will be hard.Tip: put it like on the photo: with one leg going straight away from the player to handle the weight. It's the same for every stand (physics).Summary: stand quality is good, there is no bag but Amazon customer service was great."
3,Not for tall people and mine did not hae a carry bag,"One of the reasons I had purchased this stand was that many of the other reiewers had mentioned that it came with a convenient carrying case, but mine did not. Also my son is tall 5'11"" and we need to raise it to the highest level so that he can practice while standing. When this is done the tripod base is very small, but seems to stand up fine. I will note that we did place a music book on it and and did not experience any issues. It does seem to be sturdy enough for our purposes."
5,The Perfect Music Stand,I bought this music stand because it was one of the cheapest on amazon. I got the product quickly and it's perfect for reading music off of.
1,Buying something else,The bottom part of the stand is fine but the top part keeps falling backwards. I tightened the hand nut as tight as I can get it but the top just won't stay. Can't write on a piece of sheet music either without the stand falling back. I'm buying something else.
2,No Bag,"Many of the reviews indicated that a bag was included, but that was not the case. There are cheaper options that I passed on just to get the carrying case. The stand itself is fine, but my son was very disappointed that there was no case."
2,OK,"One of the most annoying personnalities on TV now has his own grilling book. Recipies are ok, but not the best grilling book by any means. If you want a GREAT grilling book get The Gourmet Grill (if you can find it now because it's out of print but it is fantastic! )"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Don't waste your time unless you are a Bobby Flay groupie. Instead, try one of Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughy's books like ""Thril of the Grill"" or ""License to Grill"". Those books provide much more thoughtful advice on grilling technique with both traditional and exotic ingredients."
5,Hats off to Bobby Flay!!,"Once again, a great cookbook. How generous of Bobby to share his culinary secrets. Mesa Grill is phenomenal. If you have the means, you must go. If not, this book brings a bit of Bobby's artistry to your table."
2,"Decent content; grotesquely distracting layout & ""artwork""","While Flay's recipes are pretty good, the totally obnoxious layout and distracting so-called artwork make this a rather difficult book to work from. One has to wonder if the same Food Network consultant had a hand in both this one and the equally badly presented ""Emeril's TV Dinners"". It's a pity when otherwise good chefs are presented as idols, and their recipes get lost in the glare. If you can, take a look at it in a local library or bookmonger and see if you can deal with it before purchasing a copy."
2,Good food but very annoying book,"I like his show, he makes some real good food. So why did I find this book annoying? It's not a real good cookbook in my opinion. First off, EVERY recipe has a yield for 8 persons. How many times do you cook a great meal for 8? I never do. And some of the ingredients are 1/4 cup, tablespoon, etc... which ends up 1/16 if you divide by 4. Plus some of the ingredients are not normal, which I really hate. I was looking for a grilling cookbook where I can use ingredients I already have on hand. No menu suggestions either. And one last annoying thing: He uses this ancho chili powder in which is mentions the store you can get it from on every damn page. Sorry Bobby, this book is not good."
5,Bobby Flay's Boy Meets Grill,"Bobby Flay comes through in this book with his flair for strong flavors, simple recipes, and grilling techniques. I especially like the non-meat recipes like Grilled Flatbreads, and veggie recipes. The meat recipes are excellent also, as well as his special relishes and marinades. This book made me run out into a cold Maine winter night and fire up the grill!"
3,Not-easy grilling,"I am a huge Bobby Flay fan, and this book turns out some great recipes, but they are very time consuming, difficult recipes. If you want to turn out some high-end barbecue dishes, this book is for you. Be prepared to put in some serious prep time though."
4,Interesting.,"The only reason this did not get a 5 is that I am not sure about how to do this, more over I am a traditional quilt lover and I am not very artsy. I know folks that love the stack and wack. Nice book and great colors."
4,Versatile,"I have used this book more than any other quilting book I own, and I own a LOT. It is fast and colorful with lots of variation in the finished product. You can do straight or curved cuts, squares or triangles or circles, place the squares straight or on point, do multiple centers, or add appliques. My favorite is Lounge Lizards. It has lots of black and white prints with shots of intense color. I made it as a baby quilt for a jungle theme. The lizard appliques were perfect. Because I am not overly fond of the some of the author's color choices, and I agree with another reviewer that the borders are predictable, and because there are no quilting instructions (this book instructs you on how to make the quilt top and sew it together, but no ideas as to how to quilt it), I would have to rate down to a 4. But the tops and instructions get a 5!!"
2,Nice book about piano playing,"This is a story about a Jewish girl named Lisa. Her life was saved when her parents sent her to England during the Nazi regime. In England she held a job, lived and played the piano while other children in Europe were dying in concentration camps.She spent most of her time playing the piano to obtain a place in the Royal Academy.Other Jewish children were in Europe dying of starvation.Lisa had a job - bought nice clothes and lived in a hostel where people loved her and looked after her.Jewish children in Europe were dying while their parents were gased or killed slowly by the evil Nazis. They had no new clothes and no piano.I'm glad Lisa had new clothes, a job playing piano in a bar while Jewish children and adults were being killed in Europe.Lucky Lisa."
3,"Good story, mediocre writing.","This book is certainly a heartrending tale of one young girl's triumph as a jewish refugee in WW2, but I found the narrative too simple and wooden. Worth the read, but serves more as a historical vignette."
1,Magic Flute,I shall be happy to review this whenever it is delivered. Thus far it is three weeks late.
5,The vision of two genius weaves a spell of enchantment.,"From the first captivating moment with Bergman painting portraits of transfixed viewers anticipating the marvel that was Mozart, this video delivers with dynamic drama, heart-warming humor and simple but profound wisdom. Bergman and Mozart share a deep sensibility to the power of the monomyth (George Lucas' resource for the Star Wars movies). The two masters also share a reverence for perfect beauty; of this there is an abundant feast. My ten year old boy and eight year old girl are as mesmerized as I am, and the gorgeous music resounds in all of our heads between viewings. The delightful translation reads like an exquisite picture book."
2,A dissenting opinion,Bergman's production pales in comparison to recent stage productions in both community theater and on the larger stages in Philadelphia.There is entirely too much standing around. Bergman appears to have employed good singers who view acting as an annoyance. The shots of the audience are in bad taste and detract from the continuity of the story.
2,"It may sound Ugly,but this is Good AND Bad-","I would have to agree with both the positive AND negative comments about this version of Mozart's Die Zauberflote. All the technical and production comments are accurate enough,but also,(and more importantly),1)This opera is written in German and I'm a big believer in performing great operatic works not only in their entirety,but also in their original language, 2)AND most importantly for myself,the opera is intended to be a comedy;yes,but a BLACK COMEDY! This production turns it into a FARCE,(which is why children probably love it so much).If the kiddies saw this opera as intended,(regardless of choice of language),they would probably go running and screaming to dive under their beds and shake! The evil Queen really IS EVIL! More like in Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' than say, Jareth in 'The Labyrinth',(as a reference only). I think one is able to get a little more comfortable with Bergman's Queen than Mozart intended. 'Nough said."
2,Probably Not What You're Thinking,"There are several rave reviews, and so I was skeptical to believe the dissenters :).. yet here I am. I bought this DVD thinking it would be an opera on film, basically. However, it's filmed as a sort of hybrid between a movie (there are long bits of dialogue that are spoken, not sung) and an opera. Also note the film is in Swedish, so the songs will sound a bit different than most recordings you hear (like the famous Queen of the Night scene, which I thought was a bit disappointing). Lastly, the cinematics are a bit dull. Compared to others of Bergman's films like ""Fanny & Alexander,"" the camera-work is terrible -- poor lighting, fuzzy picture quality."
1,Apalling!,"I'm in the minority here. Upon the recommendation of someone who is clearly no judge of opera, I rented this - fortunately. The looping was most disturbing and the voices were inadequate - and that's being complimentary.The Tamino was quite beautiful asleep - awake, he was less so and even more boring, a pale Prince Valiant with neither voice nor animation.As an admirer of Bergman, I cringe over this travesty."
4,Bravo Bergman/Bravo Mozart/Bravo Von Karajan,"This movie is visually stunning. It's weak and under orchestrated in places. The Queen of the Night is visually extravagant and should be, but suffers vocally in this movie. Her arias are sublime and not treated so. Sarastro is magnifique-beautiful baritone.If one could overdub the 1980 Deutsche Grammophon(Herbert Von Karajan,cond.,Karen Ott as Queen of the Night) recording over Ingmar Bergman's film prowess it would be an absolute masterwork.It's still not bad. I'd recommend it, but it could have been done better."
2,"OK, unless you care about the story.","It's pretty, and the singing is competent. But too much is cut from the book. Dialog isn't just there to waste time between musical numbers; you have to develop the story. I realize, of course, that people generally go to the opera simply for the music, but as a composer of opera myself, I can tell you that the story is the most important part of the piece; without it, the music is pointless. And even when the music is Mozart's, you can take out large chunks of dialog simply because they're not sung and still expext the piece to work as a whole.For a truly wonderful video of Magic Flute, I recommend the Metropolitan Opera recording from the late eighties. This is the production that set the standard for all contemporary productions to follow. Right now, it's still VHS only, but it's still more than worth it. And it respects the story as well as the music."
3,Disappointing soloists,"Josef Kostlinger as Tamino is barely adequate and Birgit Nordin as Queen of the Night is a major disappointment. A world class soprano is required to handle the Queen of the Night's difficult arias. Hakan Hagegard is superb as Papageno. Irma Urrila performs very well as Pamina. Apart from Hagegard, the star of the show is the Swedish Radio Chair conducted by Eric Ericson.All in all, a pleasant enough Magic Flute, if you like it performed in Swedish. My perfect Magic Flute would be James Levine's Metropolitan Opera recording of the Magic Flute. I would keep all of his soloists (especially Kathleen Battle as Pamina and Kurt Moll as Sarastro), but replace the Metropolitan Opera Chorus with the Swedish Radio Choir or the Stockholm Chamber Choir. These choirs produce a full, rich sound without the heavy, annoying vibrato that comes from the Metropolitan Opera Chorus."
3,Said to be a classic representation of Mozart,"With the limp wristed prince this strange mystical trial of a prince and his princess doesn't really come off for me. The opera house staging is poor and comic relief peasant girl is actually more beautiful than the lead singer as the princess; which reminded me of the latest phantom of the operawhere the opera lead female singer is a primadonna of the worst kind.The dragon at the beginning kind of looks like Barney from the children's show or a bad Japanese Godzilla movie?The plot is probably an offense to brotherhoods of a church natureand with Lutheran wars having just taken place in Europethis whole mystical-mythological theme isn't up to the Wagnerian ring cycle?So for me the legend of ""Magic Flute"" wasn't well represented in this presentation. I came to this opera expecting the Bergman touch,and I didn't get it."
4,Cute Plush Dog and Doghouse,"The dog house is a nice size for small hands. There is a handle at the top of the doghouse which is plush. Inside is a pink stuffed dog, different from the picture, but cute. My daughter is four and loves dogs. This made a nice little gift that she adores. She says it is really really great... I agree and can't beat the price."
5,The Rat Pack at its best!,"Love these posters. One is of them playing pool, and the other at the ""Sands"" hotel.I love these two posters so much that I had them framed, and put the billiards one in the living room, and the ""Sands"" in a hallway.Terrific value for the money, and the packaging was flawless."
3,"Data, data, data, no story no narrative","This book is merely a compilation of statistics that run counter to WTO claims. There is no history of the WTO, no descriptions of its members, staff, headquarters, etc. There is no continuous narrative. Just statistics and data, data, data.A good reference book for lawyers, trade-representatives and politicians."
5,"Kick Who? That's right, Kick Axe","What's to say? I guess I'll say that Kick Axe is one of the most under-rated, unheard bands in metal. I was given a copy of Vices a few months after it came out and I was hooked. I saw them live in Colorado Springs on the Welcome To The Club tour. They blew the doors off the place. If you want to get an idea of how good they were, buy this album. Then try finding a copy of their next album, Rock The World. You won't be able to get it cheap. They were an immensely talented band. This album is full of great song writing, outstanding musicianship and great vocals. I completely disagree with another reviewer who classified this as ""cheese"" metal and then said not to get Rock The World. These guys were great. They only made three albums, but the scope of music on these albums is vast. I recommend this album very highly."
5,welcome to the club-kick axe,"If you're a true fan of hard rock-this is it!,no doubt about itthe most infamous of all.It's really sad that alot of rockstations don't know this one.What a great injustice!I was luckyto get these cd's back when they first came out-they totallyrock from begginng till end.I hope george criston gets backwith them.If u get a chance to buy it,don't hesitate!This is amasterpiece!."
4,great disc but not worth $80,"i had this on cassette way back in the day but there's no way I am paying $80 for 10 songs. Why is this so friggin expensive??come on sellers, lighten up."
4,good interview,"this interview I found interesting because I like the series and know little of the actors envolved. I thought the interviewer didn't spent enough time with each actor. I just finished watching the 5th season of breaking bad, so I realize the actors don't yet know the journey they are going on. An up-dated interview would be good. I applaud AMC for making a contraversial drama without the usual profanity (bad language) that todays writers think they need to spew-out to make criminals credible."
2,A Text In Strong Company,Heuring & Jordan covers all of the key areas of computer architecture but has sparse description. I did not like this book as a course text when I was in college and I still do not care for it as an engineering reference. For all aspects of computer architecture I find Patterson & Hennessy's explanations more clear and their examples more illuminating.
4,A good introductory book on computer design,This book provides good coverage of all of the basics of computer design. It's modern and up-to-date and covers everything from the very basics to more advanced concepts like pipelining and parallelism.The authors follow through a RISC computer example that they build on as they introduce concepts. It is useful to see a practical application of the concepts as they are introduced.This edition of the book has a bunch of typos but all in all it is a good book
1,"For first-course undergrads, this book is unusable","I don't doubt this is a good book for graduate level readers, but I am a straight-A undergraduate student in computer science and I got absolutely nothing out of this book. I think the only reason our school uses it is for the simplified SRC assembly language it uses, which I agree is very nice. But as an introduction to logic gates, binary arithmetic, basic computer architecture, etc., (the stuff you cover in the undergrad computer architecture class), you better hope you have a decent teacher and make sure you go to class!"
5,"Yes, but...","I ... found Fowlie's over-literal translations ugly and lame. But I think this may be deliberate. The unbeautifulness of the translations forces you back to the exquisite French original. It's a joy to have these poems as Rimbaud wrote them, and a bilingual edition is a must for the non-French-reader. If you want a beautiful English translation, I recommend reading Paul Schmidt's in conjunction with this one."
1,-->Don't Buy This For The English Translation!<--,"Wallace Fowlie first published this book in 1966 and his English translation is quite biased even for 1966. His sanitized editorial of the original French poetry is sad. You can pick up a French dictionary and perform a similar translation without knowing any French. He has lost all the imagery and beauty of the original work. It looks like the work of a student in a first-year French class.Fowlies' biographical sketch of Rimbaud in the Introduction is incomplete. He skims over Rimbaud's homosexuality and his relationship with Verlaine as ""troubled, and at times tragic..."". Hardly a thorough and accurate reflection of Rimbaud during his most prolific period. Maybe Fowlie's overly cautious attempt to not offend his readers led him to filter out the imagery in his attempted English translation."
4,Talented - too bad he abandoned writing before age 20!,The great surprise with this book is that it contains the original French text on the left hand pages with the English translation on the right. This added enormous value to the book that was not apparent from its description. The poetry itself is magnificent at times and hard to follow at others. It is obvious that Rimbaud was a great talent - too bad he abandoned writing after age 19! The included biographical information and text of his letters provide an interesting backdrop to evaluate the poems and show the absolute waste of his life after his literary exploits
2,At least the letters were intersting,"This book is another where the translator took it upon himself to rewrite the 'colors' in the work. Boo. Poetry (in a simple definition) is not supposed to please, its supposed to cause thought/emotion that wouldn't otherwise have taken place.I am fortunate enough to live a few blocks from the place where Louis Varese did the first translations, and I say a prayer of thanks every time I pass.Note to the writer: Next time pick subject matter you are comfortable with to translate, instead of leading an inquisition against work you obviously have problems with."
5,A true test of your groups skill!,"""Tests of Skill,"" has proven to be the most usefull of the Skirmisher book sieries to me, as it will test and try your groups skills in a diplomatic and even combatic way. The greatest asset is you can use these tests in their setting, or you may insert them into your own campaign at your desire. You will not be let down by this book."
5,Non-Linear Plot !?!,"In a d20 module market dominated by lead-you-by-the-nose plots and statistic heavy hack & slash, Tests of Skill is a welcome departure from the norm. It presents a setting a la 1st Edition modules where a framework geography is established, the setting is populated by interesting NPCs and encounters, and a rough narrative plot is outlined. Like most memorable roleplaying, the bulk of the story is made by the players involved. Tests of Skill is definitely a module for thinking gamers and often the 'kick in the door' types will be shocked by the difficulty of the fights they might start."
4,Great,"Even though it says it's for 12 month olds, the 9-month-old in my life loves the toy. She's always playing with the different shapes and rattling them. It's so great that they make unique sounds, are big enough so that they don't present a choking hazard, and are pretty durable."
3,"Great toy, but be careful of little hands :(","This toy is exactly what you would expect and is generally great. However, my son is nearly a year old and he occasionally gets his hands stuck in the slats. He wants to get the toys that have been put into the toy, and he squeezes his little hands in there. That would be fine, except they always get stuck and it's a bit of a hazard. Perhaps if there were no slats or they had less space between them it would work better. For now I just have to watch him very closely."
4,"Check Out Target's ""Zoo"" Shape Sorter First","I almost bought this shape sorter for my one-year-old boy, but am glad I didn't. I love this design (cylinder-shaped, holes on top and bottom, ""cage"" bars) and it looks like good quality, but I found this same design in a Target CIRCO brand wooden shape sorter, in which the shapes are animals (e.g. the circle is a hippo) and the cylinder is a ""zoo"" and my little animal-loving guy loves it! This Tolo one might be better for tiny babies since the shapes are bigger and rounder to hold and rattle, but for kids over 12 months, check out the Target one first. (Couldn't find it on their website, but check at your local Target. Hopefully it has not been discontinued!)"
3,Tiny hands get caught!,"My 9 month old daughter loves this shape sorter. The shapes are fun for her to chew on, they rattle in a great way, and she started sorting as soon as I gave it to her.The downsides:The plastic is very hard, which makes it very noisy when 6 rattle-containing toys rattle around in it while it rolls. Doesn't bother my kid, but it's annoying to me. I had no problem dealing with this anyway for the past week, so it's not a huge deal.What IS a huge deal is that my baby was just sitting on the floor playing happily when she reached in between the slats to retrieve a shape and got her hand stuck. It hurt her wrist and she was very upset. I'm unsure why Tolo would design a baby toy that baby hands can get caught in. I'm still going to let her play with it, because it did no real damage and she may have learned her lesson. That doesn't make me any less disappointed, though."
5,My daughters favorite toy!!!,This is my 10 month old's daughters favorite toy. She studies it very hard to figure how to put the shapes into the sorter. She had even started putting the shapes in without any help. She will play with this toy for a good 30 minutes before getting bored with it. That is a lot longer than any of her other toys. LOVE LOVE LOVE this toy!
3,Nice but..,"This toy is nice and teaches babies shapes. The shapes themselves rattle and my grandson likes them alot. He is really still a bit young for it yet, but likes to sit in my lap and watch me open and close it and put the shapes in for him. The one negative thing I have found about this toy is that the slats are wide enough for tiny hands and forearms to fit through. My grandson puts his whole hand inside and grabs the rattles. Wich could pose a hazard if your child fell with it like toddlers often do, or tripped while their hand was inside of it that way. It is really thick very hard plastic and designed to roll. If you look at the picture you can kind of picture what I mean. Otherwise is a bright, well made toy that seems designed to last."
5,Perfection!,"My 8 month old loves this toy--and my 4 year old and her friends love it too! It's durable, safe, entertaining, colorful and educational. We love it, and we love this brand of toys! This is definitely heirloom quality and will be handed down to our daughters' children."
5,rocking 12-string,"If you're looking to re-create the jingle-jangle 12-string sound of the Byrds, thuis iws a guitar to consider. A low actioned, easy playing instrument, the Boca is my favorite guitar at the moment (I play about 10 guitars)..."
4,Good buy,"This game is cheap and fun. You can play online with people from around the world, even on 56 dial-up. The game came fast, and has the instruction booklet on the disc so you can read it on your computer."
1,Ambulance chasers and sophists...,"... seem to run the world these days.I wish I had paid more careful attention to the reviews here before wasting any time on this book.It breaks my heart that these lampreys can extort money from corporations, then turn around and squeeze a few more bucks from us well meaning literati.And their lackeys, the Book Reviewers can always be counted on to hype them.Save your money. Buy something by Chris Buckley or PJ O'Rourke. It'll be more entertaining and more truthful."
5,great book,"I found this book nearly as engaging as A Civil Action. Smart, inspiring, very readable, and unabashedly sympathetic to the anti-tobacco crusaders, this book was a real pleasant surprise."
3,Not the best on the topic,"This book was OK, but not great. I think a better book on the topic is ""Up In Smoke: From Legislation To Litigation In Tobacco Politics"" by Martha A. Derthick. I recommend that book instead of this one. They both tell pretty much the same story."
5,"cool book, better than the ""mars-venus"" stuff","Eceptionally well written, easy to understand, and right ont he money as far as assessing personalities and so forth. This book really makes you look at relationships and your own personality much differently. Recommended highly from a long-suffering relationship junkie!"
4,Storage Bin,"This bin seemed to be the best for the money for an outside, med-sized, weatherproof storage bin. Assembly was relatively easy, but have to make sure to follow instructions carefully viewing the pictures to get right orientation of walls. Once pieces lock in, very tough to remove. Only a four star rating because the locking feature is not that sturdy. A large screw driver could probably bust the tabs that hold the lock. But, the lock does deter casual access or mischief. Overall, a good unit for the price. Caveat, only have had the unit for a couple of weeks."
4,Deck Storage,Product as advertised. Needed storage for misc deck supplies. Product was priced right and worked perfectly. I recommend to anyone looking for additional outside storage but don't need a large bin.
4,storage bin toys,This bin is tall enough that it stores all the outdoor toys my daughter has and keeps them clean.
5,Perfect for what we purchased it for,Product was exactly as advertised and shown in pics. Assembly was literally a 'snap' as that's how it went together; took all of maybe 5 minutes. Very solid & sturdy once assembled. Substantial piece.
1,No more Creative for me,Had this for 7 months. Kept it in excellent condition but after 7 months it crapped out. I had to pay shipping and deposit $20 with Creative to have them look at it. They told me it was a bad circuit board and it would cost me $125 to fix it. I told them to keep the $300 paperweight. Then 2 weeks later they call and ask me if it is correct that someone (I assume inside Creative) authorized to charge my account to fix it. I told them that if I see any charges on my account I will contact Better Business Bureau. I used to swear by Creative products. Now I just swear AT them.
5,Duojett71,"This album is a fine return to form from this great Swedish band. I did not think they could top 2002's 'On Fire', but somehow they did! Singer J.B. never falls short of amazing. He has got to be one of the greatest Hard Rock/Metal singers of the day. Michael Ammot's guitar playing is top notch and draws alot from his influences such as Michael Schenker, Robin Trower, and Frank Marino. If you are into Deep Purple and Dio era Rainbow, do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this. This along with 'Wolf's Return' by J.B.'s other band Grand Magus are my two picks for best albums of 2005."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!,"I made the mistake of buying these from Staples. If you listen to the entire CD there will be noisy spots on most of the them.Staples have been having an amazing ""Special Purchase"" sale on these HP CD-Rs for months and they won't take them back.I called HP Customer Service to complain about these bogus CD-Rs. They won't even return my call.STAY AWAY from these HP CD-Rs! Get Sony or Maxell instead."
1,Major problems!,"These CD-R's should be recalled! I tried 4 discs from a 50-pack and NOT ONE would work in my DVD burner, even though Maxell and Sony CD-R's work fine in my machine."
1,Sounds like bad FM radio,I have burnt several albums onto these CDs as backups. This was a mistake.They sounds fine for the first couple of tracks. But then they start to sound like an FM station that has a weak signal.I am just glad that I got these on sale... Had I payed the regular price I would be extremely ticked.
3,Great on the Basics; little substance beyond that,"I tend to agree with many of the other reviewers. This is a well-written and useful reference guide on how to save money and spend your money wisely. If you're struggling with your finances, this book is a great starting point (if you take his advice to heart and act on it).If, however, your finances are already in order you'll likely be disappointed in the book. For instance, if you are saving properly for retirement, have little or no credit card debt, budget or otherwise control your spending, have 3-6 months of cash reserves for emergencies, have raised your insurance deductibles and know when (and when not) to file an insurance claim, etc., then there's not much here for you other than an affirmation of what you're already doing. Much of his advice will seem like ""common sense"" to you."
3,Less talk and more action....,"I have just started out on the long road to investing. After reading several Suze Orman, and Investing for Dummies etc books I was just hungry for more information. This book is filled with it, after you get through all the wording. I just wanted the facts plain and simple. I would like a book made up of all the end summary comments, that would have been of more use to me. But this would have been of more use had I read it in the beginning."
2,Not for the truly broke,"Yes, if I bought a $3 latte every day, and I cut that out, I could save more than $900 a year.Guess what? I can't afford a $3 latte every day and the best way I have found that Clark could help me save money was if we had never bought his book."
4,Very informative book,"This is the first book that I have read by the intelligently frugal guru, so I can make no comparisons. For a novice like me, I found the book easy to read and understand. I recommend his practices for people who do and do not understand how to get the most value for their money."
3,outdated,"Clark Howard has a good morning TV show. I could get these tips from his show or website. Most responses were just ""common sense"""
4,The Indisensable Biography,This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know more about the father of our great nation.
3,Maybe its just me,"I have read a lot of biographies, including Adams, Monroe, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, and for some reason that I can't put my finger on, this one just didn't seem to connect for me. Between the minutiae of meetings and the broad picture of 'everyone loves him', I just couldn't find a middle ground of 'here's who he was.'"
5,Excellent biography for our nation's first President,"I am currently reading biographies for the Presidents of the United States in order. I chose this book by Flexner as he is one of the more recognized biographers for George Washington. I did not wish to read a multi-volume biography, so this one was excellent. This was a great book to start this adventure with as it was not too long, but long enough to maintain the important details of Washington's interesting life. This book read like a novel, only growing tedious during the descriptions of his multiple failings as the commander in chief during the Revolutionary War. For anyone with an interest in Washington, I strongly recommend this book."
3,"This is not a review, but some information...","Flexner also has a multivolume biogaphy which adds more detail and more thorough explanation to the events of Washington's life.If this short biography captured your interest, then the multivolume biography will satify more o f your interest in Washington's life."
4,Great Biography on George Washington,"This book is a great biography on the public and private life of George Washington and the political events of his lifetime. I liked the unbiased way the author wrote about Washington. However, I think that someone who is more familiar with the history of that time would enjoy this book more than someone looking for an informative yet easy read on George Washington."
5,The Best Grabber,We have owned many grabbers over the years. This is the best grabber we've ever used! The description says it will pick up a penny... it will actually pick up a dime from a solid surface or carpet. Securely hold heavy jars and boxes retrieved from high shelves. Easy squeeze grip lever.
2,Simply Blah,"This is not among the worst of the many novels featuring Edgar Allan Poe as a character, but that hardly makes it good. Unlike many novelists who write about Poe, Moore obviously made some effort to research his life. Unfortunately, many of the sources she used are now considered outdated or otherwise discredited, ultimately giving her story the same lack of believability found in most Poe novels. Most of this book is, let's say, ""accurate but fake.""Unfortunately, ""Fever"" works even less well as a novel than it does as biography. Moore's attempts to make Poe sympathetic have him come off instead as simply pathetic. The writing and characterizations are universally dull. And I'm really, really tired of novelists endlessly depicting Virginia Poe as the eternally infantile, bland ""child-wife""--an outmoded depiction no reputable Poe scholar endorses anymore.Someday, someone will write a historically accurate, well-written biographical novel about Poe. That hasn't happened yet, though."
5,Pirates of Ersatz,"A great story for old time sci fi fans. Murray Leinster was one of the masters of the 50s and 60s. The only hitch I found was in looking for the original Pirates of Zan. I initially found this one, and bought it, but wasn't sure if it was the same story, so bought Pirates of Zan as well. It was the same story, so get one or the other, but not both."
5,"A ""must have"" book for natural medicine doctors and students","Drs. David Brady and Lew Huff have done a truly excellent job of overviewing and synopsizing many of the common conditions that doctors of chiropractic(DC) have been treating effectively for many decades. The ""Instant Access"" design of this book makes it very user friendly and desireable in both a busy office setting and for home study. The addition of nutritional protocols and appropriate laboratory assesments for the conditions covered make this comprehensive book a ""must have"" book for both new and seasoned doctors and for students of natural medicine whether they be DCs, NDs, DOs, or MDs. Non-professionals interested in making sure they are receiving the most comprehensive care possible will also derive tremendous value from owning and reading this book. Bravo to the authors for offering such a fine contribution to natural medicine!"
3,you get what you pay for,"The delivery time was very good. The cane is of good workmanship, But why in the hell put a plastic ball in the handle,it just blows my mind. If I can figure out how to get it out maybe I will put a nice stone in it, something that does not rattle."
5,Hank Thompson's Very Best,"We just lost Hank recently and this if by far his best album. I grew up listening to Western Swing, with my dad being a professional steel player here in Nashville, I really didn't have much of a choice. This live album has it all - great songs, and one of the best-if not the best swing band to ever grace a stage. After all, with Bobby Garrett on steel and the Merle Travis playing, it would be difficult to record a bad record.If you are fan of Western Swing you will not be disapointed with this album.

2,Not Krause's Best Work,"This is basically a beginning college text on electromechanical devices. Not enough info for the engineer who works in the field. If you're going to get a book, spend your money on Krause's electrical machinery book and augment it with some cheap basic texts on machinery that will give you the basics for electo-mechanical devices. I'd only buy this book if it were extremely cheap (which I did...by buying it used)."
2,Panasonic CD player is not continuous,"The Panasonic CD player has a good sound quality, but does not automatically change from one CD to the next. It requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one CD to another. This feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications, and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five CD's."
3,not well done,The only problem I've had is that the cd reader appearantly was not cleaned before it was sold as reconditioned because it started not playing some cd's well-missing out on some track parts that play well on my older players.Larry
2,Maybe I got the lemon but this is rediculous!,After about 7 months it won't stay off. When I turn it off it comes back on after a few moments. I have to pull the plug. I've had problems with it reading the right tracks also. It does look good and sound good for a small system though. Maybe I got a fluke as it seems like many others are OK with it. Take your chances and good luck.
4,A real upgrade !!!,"Not a kid but wanted to write a review without signing into the website. I love this stereo system. Previously I had a RCA 2041, which was crap. This system is a real upgrade. The disc changer is a bit cumbersome you can't change all the disc at the same time. However, the sound on this system is excellent..I play mostly jazz and with this system the instruments sound so crisp and clear. I just pop five cds in and get lost in the music its a wonderful experience."
1,Broke within nine months,"Worked great for about nine months. Now it fails to read CD's. It says ""No Disc"" when all five cd slots are full."
4,Panasonic,"I chose this unit based on size, price and performance.It was easy to assemble. I find it a bit complicated to use.The performance is excellent. I mainly listen to opera and show tunes. I keep the system in the basement where I can listen at high volume without distubing anyone else in the house.I am not a terribly careful listener but I find no fault with the sound quality.Overall I am satisfied with the performance of the panasonic."
3,Keep out of reach of children,"I can't say anything about the sound quality because we only had it for a day. Just to warn others, my husband got it all set up and it was on a low table while he worked on it, my 3 year old opened the cd tray and pulled it out and it was broken. My husband took it apart and said the only thing that was stopping the tray from coming out were small plastic teeth that were now gone. If you have a child keep it out of reach at all times."
3,Not His Best.,"Mr.Sardonic, George Carlin is a pistol to be sure. His cynical depiction of American society may disturb many people. But, generally I'm not one of them. Few could deny that he is wickedly funny. He gives blistering attacks on the English language, dumb people, hypocracies of society, etc. His two monologues ""A Place For My Stuff"" & ""Baseball & Football,"" are very entertaining.However, his type of humor really needs to be seen & heard. It does not translate as well on the printed page. The book also has three flaws. The order the monologues were in did not fit well, the book is rather short, & Mr. Carlin seemed far to bitter. ""When Will Jesus Bring The Pork Chops"" was a little better."
4,"Although mostly hilarious, can be a little tedious","George Carlin is one of the funniest comedians I've ever watched, listened to, and now read. His book has plenty of stuff you'll find yourself on the floor rolling to (GC's Guide to Dining Out, The George Carlin Book Clubs, and plenty of other stuff) and classic stuff (A Place For Your Stuff, Baseball and Football), but he also tends to get so serious with himself that it can actually scare you (Legalize Murder), and that can make you think he's heartless (Play Ball, Sports Roundup). However, he does mention that he has a long marriage and a loving family, so the man means well, and just trying to be funny. AND HE DOES SUCCEED!!!! GO GEORGE!!!!"
4,Very good,"Even though Carlin sometimes doesn't know when to use Lenny Bruce style humor or Steven Wright observational style, this book worked big time for me. He's best when he finds his own voice and runs with it. Thanks George."
4,a Carlin free-for-all....,"....and definitely not for the easily insulted, offended, or hyperpolitically juxtaposed. Good flip-through mayhem directed everywhere and nowhere in particular. Lots of fun."
2,Fans will be disappointed. All others amused.,"Having been a huge follower of his work, I've heard just about every monologue he's ever done. I first heard of this book when he went on the radio promoting it as the material he might not live to deliver. Sad to say, it isn't. Most of the book is rehashed material from his old performances and are jumbled about in the form of disjointed, unrelated one-liners that are too forced to be funny.On occasion, he falls back into form and begins new rants in his classic outrageous style, but these moments are brief, occupying maybe 10% of the book. The whole debacle left me feeling like I had just watched a rerun of his tv show where he tried too hard to be funny and ended up caging the comic madman that he truly is. This book makes Carlin seem like a profane Dave Barry."
1,The Nutty Misanthrope,"""F@#$ hope."" That's how George Carlin describes his worldview in the preface of Braindroppings. ""...if you think there is a solution, you're part of the problem."" Then he goes on to describe himself as ""a joyful individual with a long and happy marriage"". I think Carlin still excels at what he does best, joking about our misuse of the English and about things we all experience in everyday life that we never discuss. Still, read this book only if you desire a depressing, incoherent rant. A manic Andy Rooney.All this leaves me wondering where Carlin's performance-related bombast ends and his real feelings begin. ""When I see children today, I think of tomorrow's f#$%ed-up adults."" This can't be the same guy who narrates Thomas the Tank Engine stories for kids' TV. Or can he?"
3,Uneven. Sometimes hysterical other times it drags.,"Some very funny stuff in this book. At times I had tears streaming down my face. Other times, it dragged on. Best way to read the book? Pick and choose your chapters."
4,"Laugh out loud, side splitting funny.","CARLIN RULES!! So much to laugh about, think about. Just when I think, Man, he's nuts, he starts making sense. I've always enjoyed his comedy and now his cynicism, this is great comedy. I was in the elevator with my book and a grey hair told me her husband got her the book for Christmas and she just thinks he's great. George is timeless, a man for all ages. I always watch his TV comedy specials, but having his thoughts, jokes and etc mobile thats how I like him. I can get a Carlin fix at my leisure day or night. Thanks for the written word."
5,I Cried Because I Was Laughing So Hard.,I just finished reading Brain Droppings after a friend recommended it to me. I must admit I started crying because I was laughing so hard. I absolutely love the way the book is layed out. It is fun and easy to read. I don't personally get what all the uproar is about. He really does challenge us while at the same time making us laugh. A rare combination.
5,Brilliant to the initiated--Misunderstood by many,"Funny, profane, thought-provoking, insightful, playful, and apparently ire raising for many. In other words, typical George Carlin. This book has an astoundingly high laugh out loud ratio, but perhaps more interestingly it serves as a primer for independant thought or as a document of one man's Belief System(BS) free thinking. If you think you might be enraged by this book, you will be, so skip it. If you are expecting laughs only, there are many to be had , but be prepared for laugh-free yet very interesting opinions. If while reading, you judge this book to be the rantings of a malcontent, re-read the introduction and marvel at the thoughts of a true outsider who is actually more inside than many average joes will ever be."
2,Crabby old man,"Seems that as he's gotten older, George Carlin has just gotten crabbier. He takes ranting to a new low. I was really disappointed with this one. He needs to take a valium!!"
2,"Cold, Bitter and Not Funny","Carlin's humor does not transfer well to text. He comes across bitter, hateful and humorless. His take on the English language is often amusing and some of his lists are funny, but the humor and ""insights"" were minimal.This book disappointed me greatly."
5,FUNNY,I love George Carlin and this book is great. It has alot of different jokes and doesn't have to be read in one sitting.
1,The title is too flattering.,"Growing up, every time I heard George Carlin's name, I would think of his consistent and shockingly hilarious acts. Reading through the first half of this book, I came across some shades of vintage Carlin, however, I had to sometimes skim some very mediocre material in order to ferret out such sections. Finally, I got tired of skimming the uninspired (something I don't think one should feel compelled to do when reading a humor book). Out of fairness, I admit I haven't read the second half of the book yet, but I'm not so sure I will. If you're expecting something similar to ""The Rants"", ""Sein Language"", or even Paul Reiser's first book, forget it."
1,George Carlin No Longer Has It,"Thank God I was wise enough to check this book out of the public library. If I had purchased it, I would have demanded a refund from the publisher. This book shows that Carlin, one of my favorite comedians in the Seventies, is now just a tired hack. He is an awful writer. Worse, he no longer knows what is funny because he is sorely out of touch. As a fan of comedy I have witnessed the sad demise of his talent. Case in point: When I saw him perform live 15 years ago in New York he absolutely killed. But when I saw him perform live in Cleveland back in 1993, he was just going through the paces: giving an impersonal show and rushing off the stage as if he had a plane to catch. Out of respect, I would never pay for him again. Carlin is like a champion prize fighter who stayed in the ring too long. He should hang up the gloves; the pen; and the microphone and leave his fans with pleasant memories of what he once was."
2,If a book is worth a penny...,"...it tells you something about the quality of the material.Yes, the book is funny, in Carlin's usual ""shouting in your ears"" way. But it gets old after a chapter or two.Borrow it from a library for a good chuckle, but not worth owning."
1,Must be the delivery...,"It must be his delivery, because this book just isn't funny. Bought it for a long plane trip and after a few pages it just made the trip seem longer."
1,"Love George, but don't buy his book...","George is a great comedian, but reading him is a big disappointment. You miss the timing, facial expressions and enthusiasm of his stand up presentations. Cosby translates well into books, George doesn't. Save your money, and George, if you read this, you owe me a beer!"
2,Don't Bother,"It's a shame to see an american legend fall but that's what this book is solid proof of. Carlin has gone from his famous and funny outtakes on life and people, to a crotchety old man who spews hatred page after page after page. Their are still many parts that are side-splittingly funny but they're not worth trying to find. God bless you Mr. Carlin and hopefully one day you will return to showing the joy of life and not your new found hatred of everyone and everything."
2,What a disappointment! What a grouch.,"As a long time fan of Carlin, I found the book very disappointing. He continuously crosses the line from funny to mean-spirited. Unfortunately, George Carlin has gotten old and grouchy.How sad."
3,classic carlin,Not bad and pretty cheap to. i enjoyed it but it was kinda repetitive as is silly putty and napalm. worth 4-7 bucks go
3,Carlin Pleases Only Occasionally,"I believe this is the first book by George Carlin. After being a fan of his since the 70's, I was looking forward to reading it. About 30% is hilarious, 30% just so-so, and the rest is either dumb or tries to be funny by being offensive. Of the three books of Carlins that I have (The other two are ""Napalm and Silly Putty,"" and ""When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops""), ""Brain Droppings"" is the weakest."
3,Good stuff and bad stuff,"Brain Droppings:Jokes, notions, doubts, opinions, questions, thoughts, beliefs, assertions, assumptions, disturbing references, comedy, nonsense, satire, mockery, merriment, sarcasm, ridicule, silliness, bluster, toxic alienationThe sub-title gives a good lengthy description of the book. I debated whether to write a review on this book or not. For me the language and some of the analogies are unnecessary and crude. What is disturbing is that I have a similar thought process; satire, opinions, and bizarre observations. I have some work to do. What I am not able to say Carlin is able to for me. The book contains snippets of his thoughts and observations; a mix of good stuff and bad stuff..........more stuff--need more space for my stuff--too much stuff. Read at your own risk!Wish you wellScott"
5,Hilarious and insightful compilation,"I first received this book as a gift while I was teaching English in Europe and enjoyed it so much that I used it with my students. I donated the book to some of them, and have thought about it occasionally for several years. I decided to purchase it again as a permanent addition to my personal library. This book is a gem for any George Carlin or comedy fan. It is one of the only books that I can foresee reading multiple times. The claim on the cover is true- pick it up, turn to any page, and laugh. I find it to be very helpful in the evening when I need to lighten the mood during my evening meal and in the morning during breakfast when I want to begin the day with a smile. The book contains some classic bits and some bits that may never have been performed on stage."
5,Droppings from an Old F#%!,"""Brain Droppings"" is just that - a varied collection of jokes, opinions, observations, questions, etc... George Carlin, who seems much less controversial in this day and age, is not only funny, but highly intellectual. His tirades about the misuse of language and the trends in our society are hilarious and spot-on accurate.This is a book best enjoyed a piece at a time in order to appreciate all that Carlin has to say. Nothing and no one is spared by Carlin's acid tongue as he bashes such idiotic movements as political correctness and lambasts the obsessions that imprison us. George Carlin is a breath of fresh air and it is refreshing to know that there still exist comics who can make people laugh through their wit and not through dropping their drawers."
3,decent,"Brain Droppings does have some funny parts like Carlin's short takes and unncessary words. However, the book is fairly disourganized making it difficult to read and there is a lack of cohesion in the book. The book doesn't quite live up to his stand -up routine"
3,The rantings of a grumpy old man,"I've always thought George Carlin was one of the most intelligent comics around and have always enjoyed his stand-up routines. His use of the English language is insightful. I thought his sitcom a few years back was a bad idea and showed him as a grumpy old man. Well, guess what? If this book is the real George, then he has become a grumpy old man. That's sad; he's been one of the great talents of our time."
2,Not so great actually,"I love George Carlin, but this book is only so so. It's just not his greatest work and I find most of his fans will find it disappointing. There are the occasional funny parts, but it's just not that good."
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This Book,"It completely escapes me why any intelligent adult woudl find much of value in George Carlin's Brain Droppings. To borrow from Mr. Carlin's style of writing, the droppings from this book are more likely to have emerged from the other end of one's anatomy. Save your money."
2,The End of an Era is finally at hand!,"This piece of pitiful piffle has only two barely noticeable and recognizable highlights: the classic ""Baseball and Football"" and ""A Place for my Stuff"" routines, superfluously updated for the young and ignorant '90's dwellers. I recieved this pile of paper for my birthday in '98, and it was by far, the most disappointing put-forth effort by any modern entertainer that I have ever heard of. I refer to it as such because it ended up as fire-fodder, and the front cover came in very handy as a dartboard. However, I managed to salvage the two aformentioned sections with the classicly humorous material intact. My thoughts on this bitter old man's career dwindling into the inevitable downward spiral as it has gradually has happened is this: the guy has lost it for sure, he is completely out of touch, and should give up further attempts to entertain (I use this term loosely) the general public any longer. Give it up, G.C.!"
1,He Is Quite a Character Alright!,"I would generally agree with this reviewer.""I think Carlin still excels at what he does best, joking about our misuse of the English and about things we all experience in everyday life that we never discuss. Still, read this book only if you desire a depressing, incoherent rant."" A manic Andy Rooney? That would be kind. Carlin is not nearly as bright at Rooney. I thought this guy was so brilliant when I was in college....and wasted a lot of time listening to his antics.In adulthood, I see him as an immature, insecure, and angry man, who has a complex about how intelligent he is. Enough said. He can be witty, but he seems captured by the dark side:( and has not really grown out of his adolescent angst problems."
1,BRAIN MANURE .... ZERO stars,"...There are about 20 pages worth of laughs. The rest is gross, obscene, pointless, garbage.Hey, I don't mind the occasional foul word and raunch. Not at all. But this was beyond raunchy into just sickco....with no point, therefore not funny. Gutter humor.I checked out a copy at my library and I suggest you do the same. No one deserves money for this kind of trash. It should of never been published..."
1,His incites are not very cleaver,"With all the controversy surrounding him, I expected more. I honestly could have sat down and made up a lot of his material myself. Because of his views, I expected to gain some new incite or perspective. I at least expected to laugh and didn't get that either. This book is boring. I wish I would have spent my money elsewhere."
2,sorry but can I get my money back,"I thought it was supposed to prevent slipping. Until I figure out how to hold them in place, my leather couch will stay naked."
2,Not durable,"This worked well but the plastic handles bent after use, first just a little, then so much it was useless. Handles need to be not cheap plastic but wood or quality plastic."
2,really,It does the job but it's certainly not the best scoop on the market. It's so poorly made that when you bring both together to pick it up they dont line up. Then the metal is so thin that if you hit the ground the tines will bend.
3,loved it then it broke,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. THEN SNAP, IT BROKE RIGHT WHERE THE SCREW HOLDS THE TWO HANDLES TOGETHER. THANK GOODNESS I BOUGHT TWO, MAYBE THE OTHER ONE WILL LAST LONGER. THE PRODUCT DESIGN IS PERFECT AND I COULDN'T FIND IT IN ANY PET STORE. THE ONLY THING THEY HAD THAT WAS EVEN CLOSE, HAD SHORT LITTLE HANDLES AND I WOULD HAVE TO BEND DOWN TO SCOOP."
2,not great,"It does what it is supposed to but is thin metal, i know within a year some of the tines on the rake side will break off."
2,Ehh...,"I bought this because my husband was out of town and I don't have his stomach lolHe can usually pick up dog poop just by putting a baggie around his hand and picking but I cant.This scooper picks up, but because there is a little wall on each stick, it makes it hard to place and pick up without breaking feces apart.I think if it had the walls on one stick, instead of one wall on each stick, it would be perfect...Unfortunately, I have a hard time using this"
3,"Poor Quality, but good price","I've been using this for 4 months now, and the grates don't match up anymore when I clamp the scooper. I can force it to align, but it is kind of hard to do when you're holding a bag at the same time. The price is good for what you get."
5,Last one lasted 20 years,"As far as pooper scoopers go, this is by far the best. My last one lasted 20 years and my husband ran over it with the snow blower this year so we had to get a new one. They just sell those cheap plastic ones at the pet stores. The wooden handles hold up well."
3,more of a pooper impaler,"I have to say I'm disappointed in this item, it ended up being a pooper impaler rather than a scooper. I think 2 spade ends would be better than a spade and a rake. It is nice having them hinged together though. I bought a different pooper scooper and use this one to pick up leaf piles, which I think it should be marketed as because it works great in that capacity!"
3,It's ok,"I've only used this one a handful of times and it's already falling apart (I've had it several months, but don't like it). The joint where the two handles are joined together are becoming loose and wobbly.This item would be great if you only need to scoop up 1 poo at a time. I have 2 dogs and they poop like crazy. Even though I clean up daily, I have to scoop up about 6 piles of poop a day, and double if I skip a day. It is impossible to just pick up more than 1 pile with this product because the poop will fall out if you go to pick up another pile because they bottoms are at a steep angle. So I have to carry around a baggie and empty it each and every scoop and it can get messy that way. It's so much easier to get a pooper scooper that can lay flat, so I can pick it all up quickly and dump it out at once."
2,Doesn't get all the poop in one scoop,I've used this for 6 months and finally threw it out. My dog poops across the street and I find it's difficult to get all the poop in one scoop. But the worst part is the scooper and rake didn't line up very well so it was hard to keep the poop from falling out as I walked the poop to our trashcan. Perhaps ours was faulty.
2,Not that easy to use,"I purchased this product because I had a cheaper rake and shovel, but the pieces were cheap and fell apart. I bought this item, but I did not realize that the rake and shovel were not separate pieces. I found it difficult to use and the dogs waste did not stay on the shovel."
3,ehhhh,"not sure how long this one will last. Already unscrewed the 2 parts apart so it is easier to use. Seems ok sofar, no complaints from the hubby yet (he is the pooper scooper)"
3,Useless for little dog messes,"Our very old wooden-handled pooper scooper broke finally and I thought this one would work nicely, especially since most of the reviews were positive. Wrong! The handles are very short, making a taller user (I am 5'7"" tall) have to bend over to scoop. The rake tines are so widely spaced that little dog poops fall between the tines, broken into even small pieces. I went to the local pet supply store and bought another scooper with a flat pusher and much longer handles and it works just fine. I think the Sanitary Pooper Scooper/rake would work well if the user were short and had a big dog. If you have a little dog this is NOT the scooper for you!"
3,"it works ok , but !",I was a little dissapointed when using this product . I had one previously and it lasted 15years. Thought I'd try one with claw type fingers this time. But the fingers are constantly bending out of shape. the metal used to make this product is thin and flimsy. If I were buying another one I would get both sides solid metal !
4,Well it does what it says it does lol,"Gave it 4 stars because I think it could stand to be a little taller in my opinion, thats all. Overall works great, does the job, and really like that it can be hung up instead of just laying it down somewhere."
3,It an okay scooper.,"This is an okay scooper, but the only thing is that I bet it only works on grass like it should, I use it on dirt and rock and it just picks up a lot of extra dirt/rocks. I would rather use a shovel, also the poop gets stuck on the teeth."
4,one scoop at a time,"As the heading suggests...this is good for one scoop at a time. I have 2 dogs. Which means that after I scoop the first poop...I either empty that....or go for the second poop....the first will fall out and mix with the second...then all easily scooped up and deposisted in poop bucket! (Did you really want all that detail?)The handles are a little short...and I'm almost short (5'3""). Works for me...but not for anyone much taller. I've used other scoopers that I prefer....the two handle/spatula is my favorite. But this was on sale, with free shipping....so I bought it. Do not regret the purchase...just letting you know the ""downside"", from my perspective only. It gathers the poop efficiently and emptied easily....gets the job done!"
2,Disappointing design,"The rake and the shovel of this scooper are bolted together in the center making it difficult to use. It is like trying to pick up dog waste with really long tongs - more pinching than scooping. After pick up, it was really difficult to dump the waste into our Doggey Dooley. We removed the bolt and it now works slightly better but the shovel has a high rim on just one side which still makes it difficult to use with a Dooley. Finally, after using this product, I've decided rakes aren't always a great solution for dog waste, stabbing the waste or, if it has rained, just combing through it instead of scooping. Yuck. Years ago, we had a scoop with a solid shovel, not a rake. I'll be looking or one of these instead."
1,cheap material,have had the blue handles snap on each one I have purchased. not sure why i bought the second one after the first broke. should have just thrown the money directly into the garbage
1,poor function,When this came in the mail I realized that the two pieces are joined together and have very poor function. You can't scoop well with it and regretted the purchase. I should have bought the kind I've used before.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is an example of buyer beware; you get what you pay for -- or less. The metal scoop sides and bottom are flimsy, already bent while in the box; you have to straighten them so the two sections of the scooper can semi-close. With sides straightened out, the bottom of the scooper didn't meet all the way across for you to grab those doggy remnants without leaving some behind. My dog is only 34#, and this scooper left more mess to clean up than when the little job began. Even if your pup leaves very dry stool, you'll have a mess to contend with remaining on the ground, and on the scoop. I'm ordering the higher priced scooper right now.."
5,Best On The Market,"This is a replacement for the pooper scooper I have used for more than 20 years. I was going to dismantle and refurbish my old one, but got this link. The two-part shovel and rake/spade type just do not work in my yard."
5,The very best Pooper Scooper,"Having bought one of these in the UK 5 years ago & having 6 dogs, I was anxious to replace it, but it was nowhere to be seen in my country. Thank goodness Amazon.com had it because it is the very best of its kind. The original one has been used twice a day, every day for 5 years & has only just given up, even though we left it outside in all weathers....amazing ! It picks everything up effortlessly from any surface, if you have any kind of flexibility or back problem I would highly recommend it too. Maybe people in wheelchairs would find it a little too tall to operate effectively,but the handle length & scissor action is perfect otherwise. Thank you so very much Four Paws, I know it's a bit strange to get overly excited about a pooper scooper, but you make the one downside of dog ownership a little bit brighter with your excellent product.....thank you !!!"
3,Does what it does..,"It's not the fanciest thing in the world and my kids absolutely hate it, but I think that has to do with it's purpose. It does gather quite a bit of gravel along with the intended target, and it's kind of a pain to try to ""filter"" it out, but it's better than a shovel."
2,2 stars = 8 turds. It stinks.,"This scooper would work great if scooping up very firm poops from a hard dry surface. It is terrible with grass - especially if you keep your grass on the longer side. When you scoop, it flexes, grabbing grass and leaving most of the poop behind. The scoops do not line up so you are likely to drop what you picked up. Then if the poop isn't firm, you gotta use a stick to get it off the scoops. Gag me! I would rather teach my dog to use a litter box than use this scoop! I just ordered a scooper that looks like a scoop shaped rake - it has better/more reviews than this one."
1,garbage,This is a worthless cheap poorly designed piece of trash. Don't waste your money. It's just a couple of pieces of PVC that slide in and out of each other with a spring inside. Chances are it won't fit on your door the way it is originaly intended unless the sider has about two inches of exposed frame at the top. Most sliding doors don't. Which means that you will have to use the alternate method and install it verticaly on the back end of the sider. This looks tacky and doesn't really work all that well. I had to take the entire thing apart and redesign it so the spring had more tension to get it to close the door.
1,Still not working,"Completely took apart and cleaned the door and rollers, still can't get it to to glide smooth enough to close with the new contraption. If your door is not brand new this product will not work as advertised."
2,Door closer,"If you can't close your door with only the slightest of effort, then this closer won't work."
3,It Is What It Is,It is a pyramid that I use as a paperweight which has a small picture of Dodger Stadium on it. Not bad if you are a Dodger fan.
1,Barbie goes to Barcelona,"In all seriousness, this book, has caused for the first time, a confirmed instance of the victim becoming ""dumber"" through reading. Brain cell damage incurred is equivolent to hitting oneself over the head repeatedly with a ball-ping hammer. It left me in serious doubt of the condition of the University of California educational system, one hopes she is merely a legacy student.A film version may be a serious option for Jessica Simpson to launch her movie career."
2,A Disappointing Book,"My wife and I plan our first visit Barcelona in a few months. This book told me a lot more about Greta Paa-Kerner than I wanted to know, and a lot less about Barcelona."
2,A Guiri's Adventure,"Hmm, Having lived in Barcelona I would recommend Robert Hughes' book Barcelona (given to me by a Barcelona native) for a more intellectual and historically insightful look at the culture. Barcelona is a complex mix of Catalan, Spanish, ex-pat, and tourist culture. If you want a ""living abroad"" guide try Culture Shock Spain. It's not perfect but it gives some good basic info. The movie Barcelona is also worth seeing. If you are a tourist and just want the basics, try The Rough Guide to Barcelona. Once in the city get the free magazine Metropolitan (in English). I lived there before Greta arrived, but I know some of the same people so our experinces may intersect at certain points. I was living with a Catalan so my experiences were mixed Catalan and ex-pat. It is a truly amazing city, but not the easiest ex-pat experience due to the cultural struggles between Catalans and Mother Spain ; )"
1,fluff,"Paa-Kerner never seems to shake free of her ""them and us"" mentality and thus remains for ever on the periphery of the Barcelona experience and reliant on clichéd stereotypes of the Catalans. Her twee little adventures might make good copy for a weekly woman's magazine but are not substantial enough for a booklength discussion."
4,la vida loca,"This book details the Spanish lifestyle to a tee -- especially my last three visits to Barcelona.Every American that has visited Spain, is going to visit Spain or dreams of traveling to Spain should read this book. The author relays her personal experiences with humor, history, and culture. You definitely feel like an insider in the whole Spanish/Catalan scene after finishing this book.Another plus? It is a quick read!"
2,Cheap Intake Hose and HORRIBLE customer service,"Spend your money elsewhere. Have had this piece of garbage for a month. The intake hose, which is made out of cheap vinyl, sprung a leak after a couple of days. Good luck trying to find a replacement. E-mails to the manufacturer's ""customer service"" go unanswered. Don't waste your time or money"
4,Rock of Ages,"This release by Gary took a little time to grow on me but I bought it a day after seeing him in concert. Vocals are better than expected as I had never heard any on previous albums. The mix is a little flat with a bit too much emphasis on the guitar but otherwise a great bit of work. Gary seems to have a different view of life and it shows in his songwriting, but that is a GOOD thing. I enjoy every track on it but the title song sticks in my mind most of all. Highly recommended, old school rockers will dig it!"
2,Warning,"When I first saw this video I read 3 reviews, telling us about how wonderful this tape is. This is NOT the correct tape! This is NOT the one that first ran on Animal Planet...I am sending it back it is not a good value for $$$"
4,A Fun Series,"This is a fun series, but this title is a little too difficult. My character was killed or imprisoned a few times through no fault of mine. It was entertaining going on various missions for the Uttakin, but I didn't want to have to cheat or keep restarting to get through the difficult parts.In my opinion The War-Torn Kingdom is the best book of this series, because it is easy enough to get through without restarting. Dave Morris' Heart of Ice is also good."
2,watch,The watch I received was damaged and I need to send it back - I emailed Watchzone and they have not sent me a reply. I would like instructions on how to send it back for a full refund.
3,A Book of 2 Acts,"I found this book to be fairly interesting however I didn't agree with some of the actions of the characters. It is really a book of two acts. There is a lot of mystery and intrigue and then there is an event that finishes the book.Patterson, with this book more than any other seems to be taking on John Grisham. J.P. has an unusual way of handeling the situation, but it is a good story in the typical Patterson fashion. I finished it in about 3 hours, so it's not a particuarly long book, perfect for a plane-ride.Enjoy-Tim"
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Patterson's `Beach House' is one of his `just above' average efforts. Big money, crooked cops, search for the truth, and vengeance, combine to make this a fun summer read. There are a few surprises as well as a fast-paced plot that should please most Patterson fans. His typical short chapters make this an ideal beach house read.Recommended for all Patterson fans."
1,Not what I expected...,"A good mystery thriller like this must answer three questions by the end of the novel: Who was/were the killer(s), Why did he/she/they committ the murder, and How did he/she committ the murder. This book TRULY answered one, of those questions. After Jack Mullen found out his brother's brutal death was being labeled a suicide/accident, he plunged into action. The middle of the book made me want to read more and more! By the end of the novel, however, we are only given a speculation. After reading the whole book, I wanted to know why Peter Mullen was killed. The reader knows how the murder happened because we are told from the victim's P.O.V. in the beginning of the story, and the reader can basically figure out who the killers were. However, we never find out why the murder happened. I actually looked at the last page of this book and said, ""That's it?!?"" Skip this one and try another. James Patterson, good try, but no luck in my book."
2,UNSATISFYING!!!,"The only James Patterson novel I liked is 1st TO DIE. But [not] the rest (2nd Chance, When The Wind Blows, Cradle and All, Violets Are Blue)... The Beach House has a good opening. It will hook you right on with the death of a townie. The revelation of who he actually is kinda ok, though not actually mind-blowing. And the resolution is so implausible. A mock-court hearing? C'mon! And what happened to the Dana character? She was establishied as having an affair with her dad, right? What is her connection with the whole thing? This novel tells me to stop reading James Patterson. Although, I still have a copy of The Three Blind Mice which I bought alongside with The Beach House."
4,"A perfect summer read, Jackie Collins BEWARE!!!!","Columbia Univeristy law student Jack is out to avenge his brother, Peter's death. Peter was found dead at the Neubauer's, wealthy citizend of the Hamptons in New York at a posh party.The Neubauer's are Jack's girlfriend's parents and they do not like him at all. Peter supposedly drowned, but his corpse was found covered in bruises.And why would Peter, who was hired to park cars, go in the water on a dark and stormy night??Well, Jack digs in and tried to come up with some answers. Local police officer, Frank Volpi, is of no help as he stonewalls Jack's efforts to uncover the truth.Jack uncovers some nasty secrets of the rich and famous, involving sex, blackmail, and includes an interesting cast of characters.Patterson writes an interesting tale and is a rock-solid read!!!"
4,Good no-brainer summer read,I have always wanted to read a book by James Patterson. This started out with interesting characters who ended up leaving the book too soon. The middle got a little Jerry Springerish and unbelievable but it was worth it to finish the book ( I have a personal policy about finishing a book I start). There were times when I wanted to put it down and I did. I started this with much anticipation and was surpirsed at the simplicity of the prose for such a well liked author. I am still not sure if I will read any more of his books.
5,New to this author!,This is only the third book I have read by this author and am getting absolutely hooked. It was well written with surprises around every corner. Definitely NOT one of those predictable storylines:) I recommend it highly.
2,"What happened, James?","Being a fan of James Patterson, I've read every book that has his name on it. Although this had short chapters and I recognized his writing style as easy reading, this definitely did not have the ""keep you glued to the pages"" story line that his books usually have. I have to say, I was disappointed in this one."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book, especially being a Long Islander and able to associate with the locations in the book. It was a little jumpy in the beginnning but I had to say I loved the ending and they got what they deserved."
3,Plot is crazy and not in a good way,"I'm a huge fan of Patterson but this book was disappointing to me. The plot just doesn't make any sense at the end and I felt as if I had wasted my time reading this book, started out good and I got into the characters but it just went haywire at the end.Maybe some will enjoy the twist at the end but for me I expected it to be a lot better than this."
2,A B-Movie on Paper,"Consider this a movie on paper; more specifically, a B-movie on paper. Wonder how long it took them to write this. My money is on a week. Tops.While there are brief moments of fun and fast-paced movement, it's poorly conceived, and the ending is utterly ridiculous.If you want me to spend my hard-earned money on your books, Mr. Patterson, you really must do better than this. You've become a book factory, rather than a writer. Sad."
3,Strong build to terrible ending!,"I was really enjoying this book by Patterson and De Jonge. About three quarters through the book becomes laughably ridiculous. Its hard to fathom some of the events that take place and the lack of consequences. Also, Patterson, who has a habit for this, gets preachy. I liked most of the characters here and wished they were developed more and the story slowed down. Overall a decent book with a terrible ending."
1,Don't even free.,"Predictable, poor writer, has to use sacrilegous statements to keep your attention. Don't ever bother, we have to many good writer to even get this book I am sorry that I ever read it.Dr. Roc"
1,Sand-blasted,"*Blech*I rented this as a book-on-tape and was throughly entertained until the second half, at which point I was completely creeped out.Please, don't read this. Please."
2,Not one of Patterson's better novels,"This is one of Mr. Patterson's poorest works thus far, and I'm a huge James Patterson fan. The quality of writing in The Beach House was not up to par with his other novels, which leads me to believe that Mr. De Jonge wrote this book and Patterson added a few touches and put his name at the top, just to sell the book. Seriously, from a James Patterson fan, don't bother with this book. If you want to read some ""vintage"" Patterson similar to the Alex Cross series, start with 1st to Die."
3,A good light read with not much depth to it,"A very simplistic read, and, while you expect a blowout at the end, you feel like the ending is your typical ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" ending--Give the people what you think they want... I did not feel challenged by this book. I felt it is aimed at a lower-level reading audience."
2,"Quick read, but also a ""quick write""","I would have never read this book, except it was chosen for my book club. I found the plot to be fairly predictable, the characters undeveloped, and the ending hard to buy. Rather than becoming engaged in the story, I kept thinking, I can't believe they published this. The whole book seemed so amateurish. Yes, it is a quick read, but it also seemed like a quick write. The chapters are very short--sometimes only 2 or 3 pages. I wondered if this was done to attract readers with very short attention spans. To me it made the book feel very chopped up. I commented to my book club that you could actually read this whole book in the bathroom, given the way the chapters are written. If you want to read something that is easy, doesn't require you to think, or pay much attention, that you can finish in a couple of days, and your expectations are low, this is the book for you. If you want something that is stimulating, interesting, and worthy of your time, pass this one by."
3,I like his earliest work best,"I've read all of James Patterson's books, with this one being missed until just recently. The story centers around a young man whose brother is found dead on the beach. Did he commit suicide or was he murdered? I must say, the ending was not what I was expecting, and it was quite entertaining. While I prefer Mr. Patterson's earliest novels, I still enjoy reading his books and will continue to do so."
3,If you don't mind some SICK details....!!,"Gosh! This is a very sick story---- at least for me! It starts off all right and then all the sick stuff begins to unfold and it just made me go, ""YIIIIIKES."" Yet I finished the book! It was like a CSI episode, that is all! Believe me, not a book to shell out money on! Better go get it from your library!!"
1,Idiotic,"This was the most uninteresting book thatJames Patterson has written. The wholeend of the book was so ridiculous, it wasn'teven funny, if it was meant to be. I am verydisapointed in this and where I used to justbuy James Patterson even before it got reviewedI will never do that again."
1,This may be the WORST book I have ever read......,I can't believe I bought this book!There was no character development and a very weak plot. I felt like I was reading a sequel to a previously published book and I should know who these charaters were.I feel like the publisher owes me a refund! Buyer beware!!!
2,Disappointed Author,"As a fiction/action/thriller author myself and a big James Patterson fan, I must say I was a bit disappointed in his latest novel. Usually, the characters and plot keep me twisting in my seat and burning through the pages to find out what happens next. Did not find this to be true with ""The Beach House.""Chuck Cunningham, author, ""The Jade Claw"""
4,Hated that it had to end,James Patterson did it again. The Beach House had me at the edge of my seat wanting more. I was so sad when I had finished the book I wanted more. I only wish he could write faster and get new novels out quicker. I can hardly wait for the next one.
2,Pot boilers should prohibited.,"I hope that James Patterson is busy writing another of his good books and that the few days he spent adding whatever he added to the work of the other guy did not distract him!Increasingly we are seeing that this ""working with a colaborator"" produces books with big type, lots of white space and very little meat. These serve to keep the pot boiling between blockbusters - Clancy manages this very well.Come on James - be proud of your name and reputation and don't let the publishers persuade you to add it to a light weight book."
2,Not Patterson's Best,Not Patterson's worst or best. Predictable ending with a minor twist. Entertaining but not the page turner that's expected with Patterson books. The writing also seemd to be a different style from his past books; which might be due to the additional author.
2,No real depth.,"I am a James Patterson fan and have read every one of his books. Unfortunately, this one isn't one I would recommend reading. There are too many characters thrown out all at once, and it's hard to keep track of who's who.His books usually flow and have lots of twists and turns, this one did not. I found myself reading it only because I was hoping it was going to surprise me in some way with an amazing twist.I hope his next one is better!"
2,Buy the book not the audio tape or cd,"This was the first James Patterson book I have ever read, and I thought it was just alright because the ending was implausible. The story was very interesting until then. I also made the mistake of buying it on cd so I could listen in the car. Gil Bellows voice has sort of a whistling sound when he pronounces ""s"", which can get to be annoying. Additionally, it would have been nice if he learned to pronounce the names of the towns and some of the other words before he recorded this book. The main character, a native Long Islander, would not mispronounce Ronkonkoma or Patchogue as Mr. Bellows did, MANY, MANY, times. The story was very interesting (until the end) and it kept me going through the poor narration. I love Gil Bellows on the Agency but I was disappointed with his narration."
3,Like Grisham?,"I think not... Patterson's new novel was rather dull, and the characters were undeveloped, blah, blah... Long story short: it's no Alex Cross [or Grisham, for that matter]."
4,great summer reading,"The Beach House is a great book for summer reading. It keeps you peeled to the pages wondering what's going to happen next! I'd definitely put this one on your list of ""must reads"" for the summer of 2002!"
1,How dare they,"The book was trite, superficial and a truly hard to believe story. Characters were totally unbelievable. The worst book I have read in a long time!"
3,"Alex Cross, where are you?","I'm a big fan of the Alex Cross series, but I have also enjoyed Patterson's ventures onto other avenues. This book, however, was a disappointment. The characters were very likable and the plotline was interesting, but the situations into which the characters place themselves toward the end of the book were just plain unrealistic. The actions taken by the main character were totally out of character and ludicrous. And the ending...again, just not believable. I love Patterson and anxiously await the debut of the next book, which can't be far away...but I sure hope it's better than The Beach House."
3,"A True ""Summer Read""!","The Beach House is a book I found to be entertaining, fast-paced, and very difficult to put down; and worthy of a 3 1/2 stars if [it was] allowed such a rating. I'm still trying to figure out why I feel this way overall since the plot, while interesting, is very far-fetched, the characters are superficial, the dialog is often poorly written, the love interest isn't very interesting and the ending is fairly predictable. I find this dichotomy to be characteristic of many of Patterson's books, although The Beach House is better than his other (non-Alex Cross) books. If you're looking for a light read for the beach or when traveling on vacation, one that will hold your attention throughout without making you think too much (if at all), this book should satisfy your needs. However, if you're looking for anything more than an entertaining story, try something else."
1,ugh.,"i promised someone i would read it, so that's my excuse. it went from bland to ridiculous to flat-out awful. i've never been moved enough to leave a review and i'm sorry it's the negative that moved me enough to do it."
1,Highly Disappointing,"Unbelievably lame and unrealistic plot, flat and un-interesting characters and bland predictability make this book a flop. I couldn't stop reading it in the hopes that it would redeem itself. It doesn't. Don't waste your time."
1,Disappointing With No Credibility,"This was a really disappointing book. The plot strains crdibility to say the least and gets worse as the book progresses. The climax is totally unbelievable and there are so many loose ends that you have to laugh. Character development is so thin that you have to wonder if the book was based on a cartoon strip. Finally, while the book has about 350+ pages, the type is large, the spacing is generous, and there are so many blank and half pages that one could envision this ""book"" being written over a long weekend. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Won't read another Patterson book,"I don't know whom to blame for the terrible writing plot and writing. Patterson or DeJonge. The hokey cable TV trial was the epitome. Patterson's novels remind me of those ""Starving Artist"" commercials on TV sold out of hotel conference rooms over a weekend. Those are assembly line landscape paintings where one guy paints the clouds, another paints mountains or streams, etc. Garbage, just like assembly line novels ""written"" by Patterson."
3,Stuck at the Train Station? Read This!,"Hi. This is a book about rich people and poor people and how they do not get along, and if they do get along the entire balance of the world is thrown off. The idea is not terrible original, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. When the basis of a book is easy to understand it allows the author (or authors, in this case) room to explore the underlying causes and gives them a chance to experiment. Unfortunately, neither Patterson or De Jonge to that. This is a by-the-numbers thriller. Sort of like a Lifetime movie or one of those movie of the weeks they used to put on tv. Reading this book, I got the impression that Patterson was putting his name on something to help out his friend De Jonge. I may be wrong, but I may be right.I was stuck at a train station for ten hours, so I do not think this book was a waste of my time. If you are in a similar situation, read this and you'll pass the time faster than reading the bathroom walls."
1,James Patterson you need to go it alone!,"This co-authorized James Patterson book is painful to read. I only made it to page 100. Larger than usual print, and chapters only 2-3 pages long. Too much skipping around on characters. Not up to his usual mystery style of book. Not recommended!"
5,Warning--Do not start this book on a work or school night...,"Although it's been dubbed Summer 2002's ""beach read,"" this novel will be just as satisfying when read by the fireplace under a toasty blanket while the snow falls outside. The writing flows easily and the story draws you in. This is the first real ""page-turner"" that I've experienced in several months. I recommend it highly."
4,A Little Far Out but Believable,"This is a story that is a little bit unbelievable but it's fun to read fantasy sometimes. Books are written all the time about people and events being the way we would ""like for them to be"" and not what is realistic. This is such a book. I almost stood up and cheered when I read the steps one group of people took to bring justice to an unfair situation. The powerful were beaten at their own game and I was thrilled."
2,UGH!,"I liked this book because i crammed it in the night before i was due to have read it, no my english teacher did not assign it, she let us pick out books. when she had us tell whether or not we liked the book or not, i said i wouldn't recommend it and she said ""no, not to anybody who has a brain""- this book sounds like it was written by an 8th grader, i could write a book better than this one. Patterson uses very little descriptive details."
1,"Worthless story, worthless characters, worthless read","This rates as one of the worst books I've read in a while. What showed promise in the first couple chapters as a good whodunit quickly turned into a story that was totally implausible, involving characters I cared nothing about, and that includes the grieving brother of the murder victim. The epilogue could not have been less credible. It didn't help that there were many annoying inaccuracies about the legal system that could have been corrected with minor research. All in all, the only saving grace is that this book was a quick read, with short chapters that one could complete at a stop light. At least I didn't waste that much time. Unfortunately, I did spring for a new hardback. Borrow the book or buy a used copy."
1,A waste of a day,"That's what this book was. Like everyone says its a quick read, only because of the type set and the number of blank and half pages. Or maybe because it's written on a third grade level. It starts off mildly interesting but takes many wrong turns towards a rididulous ending that was so preposterous it was painful to read. Don't waste your time with this clunker."
2,Glad I didn't spend my hard-earned money...,"I borrowed this book, and I have to admit it was a page turner. However, this is an illusion because of the super-short chapters. (What a sham!) Also, I thought this book was totally unrealistic, especially the ending. I had expected so much more from Patterson, and I am glad I didn't shell out the bucks on this mediocre read."
2,John Grisham won't be knocked off his perch anytime soon,"James Patterson takes John Grisham head on with a stupid legal 'thriller' that fails to thrill and contains just about the most stupid courtroom scenes I've ever read. It's obvious Patterson and that other guy didn't put much thought into this book, as the plot is highly unoriginal and improbable.I love James Patterson, Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Grils were just about the best novels I've ever read. After those two, his novels have ranged from average to ...The story, in short, is about this guy who seeks vengeance for his little bothers death, like I haven't heard that one before. The investigations that follow are a jumbled mess, and the fianl courtroom scene is ridiculous.John Grisham won't be in danger anytime soon"
5,Can't wait to finish it!,"I just have to say that I have never read James Patterson, but I am truly enjoying this book and only have about 100 pages to go. Can't wait to find out what happens!"
2,his worst book,"I have read and enjoyed most of his books, but this was a complete disappointment. It sounded like it would be a ""Grisham-like"" legal story, but that was not the case. This was nothing like Grisham, whose key strength is compelling characters. The problem is this is all plot, and reads more like an outline than a story. There is no depth to the characters, they are all cardboard cutouts and it is way, way over the top. Definitely did not get my money's worth with this one. Wonder if it is too late to return?"
2,No Day at The Beach,"Accustomed as I am to quality work from this author, I was highly disappointed by the effort. A half-hearted work that is utterly predictable and lacking in much tension or suspense. I suggest that you don't waste your time at this beach house. (he can do much better)."
3,It's Not Alex Cross,"I am an Alex Cross nut, but I will read anything James Patterson! It was a good book, hey I read to the end, so believe me it was good!"
1,How dare you require me to give this piece of trash a star,"I have never read a Patterson book that I didn't enjoy. I have always looked forward to his next one. Unfortunately, he has taken to co-writing. I was a little put out by the last one, but at least it approached his previous standards. This one is so terrible that Patterson should donate the entire proceeds to his co-author, who, obviously, has no furture in writing and should look elsewhere for his occupation. What could possess Patterson to write such a stupid piece of trash is beyond me."
2,Not as good as his others,"I am a huge James Patterson fan and I bought this book thinking it would be a great, suspenseful read. Well, I was disappointed in the lack of character development, especially of the main character Peter. Should we feel sorry for this guy? There were others in the book that really didn't even belong. Again, I have read better from Patterson."
2,Weak compated to other Patterson works,"Compared to his other works, this one disappointed me. Very hokey and far below the quality of his other works."
3,"Fast, Fun, Entertaining, Ridiculous!","Patterson is the master at keeping you reading with his two-page chapter gimmick. Beach House starts off a bit slow, but after page 100 you won't put it down. The only problem with the book is that the 3rd act is so implausible, it's hard to believe that someone at Little Brown didn't say something to the effect of, ""You're going to have what happen in the third act?""Maybe that did happen, and Patterson responded, ""Well, in the third act I'm James Patterson, I can do whatever I want. Now go get me a sandwich, slappy!""So, I recommend the book. Just know that it's more movie-reality based than REALITY based...-JL"
2,Reminds me of Brad Meltzer's The First Counsel,Similarities - the young lawyer mixed up with really high placed bad guys (White house and corporate honchos - hmmm...how timely!) who are way out of his league. He goes on the lam until he's able to turn the tables and take his revenge for having his life ruined by them.The other similarity is that the main charactor is too shallow to make me care about what happens to him. Blah!
1,Is this guy kidding?,"Don't waste your time on this paint-by-numbers thriller. Patterson's story of murder by the rich in the Hamptons is paper thin, and the characters are so cartoonish it makes what is supposed to be a ""page-turner"" into a thoroughly boring and annoying read. Patterson seems more interested in name dropping and showing off his knowledge of the Hamptons landscape and social scene than in actually telling a compelling story. Don't bother."
3,"One Fish, Two fish, Red Fish, ......Beach House","Such an easy read. This 358 page book has 113 chapters, which leads me to believe that Patterson sold out if he is paid by page. It reads more like a 150 page novella. Lots of white space. I wouldn't buy, rather loan from the library is my suggestion.However, even in the short space, the characters are quickly developed and a pretty good read. It is a no-brainer. Entertaining enough, with some interesting, although completely absurd plots.I have been to the Hamptons - so your guess is as good as mine about the main characters. I don't see it.I was a little disappointed in Patterson's recent novel, The Beach House. Usually, his novels are rich in plot and character development. This was rudimentary and positioned at a 6th grade reading intellect. I hope Patterson takes his critiques to heart: you are no Dr. Suess. Know your readers and bring back a thicker plot please."
3,Read if you're really bored,"Patterson seems to be helping De Jonge by putting his name on the book. It was not the typical Patterson thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending is far fetched and implausible. It's not a waste of time, but would be my last choice of Patterson novels to read."
1,All the marketing in the world won't make this a good book,"This is the book that will make me stop and think the next time some publishing behemoth pushes another 'sure' best seller. Famous authors are not sure to write great books, and this is a prime example of it.Also, it contains explicit pornography and should be kept out of reach of children, pets, and anyone who wants to avoid gratuitous filth."
1,A Patterson Disappointment!,"From the start, a James Patterson fan will notice the change in writing style in this co-authored story, and need a moment to djust. The biggest change will be the use of ""immoral"" sexual activity and its concequences to punish the villans in this text. Sexual perversion, bisexuality, rape and incest are presented as crimes much more heinous than the murder pivotal to the story line. And, AIDS should not be used as the punishment for these activities!"
5,The Beach House,This was an awesome book! I love to read and when I arrived at the bookstore this cover caught my eye. I never read a book from this author and once I started reading it I could not put it down.I read it every spare moment I had - oh the twists and turns this book had!
1,"Awful, actually worse than awful","The 4th Patterson book I have read and this one is painful to read. I thought that the LA coroners' office was doing the autopsy on Peter's body. To believe that this man was not murdered and it was an accident was to far over the top. The kangaroo trial at the end of the book was so ridiculus that it was laughable. Hopefully, the next Paterson book will be much better than this effort."
1,"God awful, but you can't not finish it, unfortunately","The basic storyline is good and the characters are interesting, but this book very quickly diverges into the realm of ""Oh come on!"" and doesn't look back, but rather drags you down deeper into the quagmire of ""I can't believe I'm still reading this."" Its one of those books that you have to finish, but unlike a great book, you are quite happy when this one is over."
1,horrible!!!,i dont like this book at all and i think from what ihave said already is enough to tell you not toget this book only one thing im going to tell you is that it is boring.
1,Just completely hopeless,"I have read some pretty hopeless thrillers in my time, but this one goes down with the worst of them. A bunch of characters no-one cares about. A murder that is so pathetic it is hardly worth solving. The challenge is to get to the end of this dreary novel. What happened to those brilliant Patterson books that you simply cannot put down?"
2,Good start BUT.........,"Patterson can write, meaning he can create interesting characters you care about and books that read fast, however I find most of his books lack reality/common sense. This book reads well and is enjoyable until you hit the last 80 pages then it becomes almost silly!!<spoiler>To get revenge the main character kidnaps eight people and holds a mock trial on live TV??? Sounds like a bad Saturday Night Live skit then a novel by a popular author. It's just one of those books that you enjoy/love and then hate after you finish it!!!"
1,Kindergarten Doodle,"Reading ""Beach House"" is basically like ripping a band-aid off, you just want to get it over with. For beginners, as you progress through the book, the story line gradually becomes less & less believable.And then there is the writing, which quite frankly, was written with the maturity of a 5th grader. The chapters' range from 1 page long to about 3 pages long. There's literally about 200 chapters in this book. And, for lack of a better word they're all pretty ""silly,"" although this wasn't there intention. Mid-way through the book I was anticipating the words to be written in those big block letters that kids in kindergarten use when they're first learning penmanship. James Patterson should personally reimburse anyone who spent a dime on purchasing this novel."
1,needed a shower after reading it,there's bad trash and good trash. this book is refuse. do your brain a favor and read the phone book instead.
3,"Ok, but the end is kind of unbelievable","Now don't get me wrong, this is a page turner, and twists and turns come, but the end is kind of unbelievable.... A good read if you are going on a long airplane trip, and just a good rent from the library. Not really worth buying."
2,Not even a howler.,"I waited to read this book after seeing it on the best seller lists, and expected a pretty good story. Wrong. It is dull and plodding and has little suspense. I also don't understand how James Patterson could put his name on this unless he was in debt to loansharks. It is as if someone else wrote it, someone with no experience. This is a real stinker."
2,The book isn't ALWAYS better than the movie...,"Hopefully, the old maxim that the book is always better than the movie will NOT hold true in this case. I picked it up from my wife (my reading is usually a bit more refined). What a mish-mash of weak plots, cardboard characters and daunting implausibilities! But he lost me when he quoted one character as singing an Allman Brothers song, when in fact it was Canned Heat. Do they not have editors any more? I'm sure it will be a movie. Here's my cry: GET ME REWRITE!!"
1,wanted to like it,"Patterson, what are you doing? Answer: coasting. This book was obviously written quickly and by and for the numbers. The first half is a page turner, but what could have been a decent mystery/thriller is ruined by the implausible and sloppy second half. Please stop reading here if you don't want to know an ending plot point (even though it's a dumb one): Two of the main characters turn out to be HIV positive, and both have slept with another main character (for one of them, this is implied, as they are blood-related)who has, in turn, slept with the narrator. Wouldn't it occur to the author to explain this, or for the narrator to worry a bit, or get tested? Just an example of how cardboard these characters are-- if the author doesn't care about them, why should we?"
3,Fast but forgettable,"This was a good book that is hard to put down but when I finshed I was not impressed by it. The ending seems far fetched and the characters one dimensial but their was alot of suspense that kept me turning the pages and finish this book in one day. I have read all of James Pattersons books and feel that this one was not written by him because the writing style seems so different from his other books, I feel Peter De Jonge wrote it and James Patterson probably gave his name just so it would sell, but I don't know. Overall a good book just nothing worth recommending."
2,Disapointed,I've been an avid reader of James Patterson since I first read Along Came a Spider several years ago. The Beach House was a real disapointment for me. The story moves too fast and there isn't a lot of real suspense.
3,Real Mystery: Why is Burt Kearns a character?,"I enjoyed this book on the sand in Key Biscayne. Paterson pulled out all the stops.But I was thrown when Burt Kearns,author of the book, Tabloid Baby, showed up as a character-- a newspaper reporter and tabloid journalist.Are there other in jokes in the beachhouse?"
2,"A bit of mystery, but NOT a thriller","I didn't care much for this book and I am a fan of James Patterson. I didn't like any of the characters, especially the grandad Mack, who was supposed to be so ""good"". He was irritating. The ""trial"" was implausible and it's result just made glad the book was over. Why was nobody angry at the character Sammy who was one of the childhood circle of friends? I never felt drawn into life at the Hamptons and wondered why it was set there and not in Bevery Hills or some other rich people's town. I only hope that the disapointment with this book that I and others felt is due to the writing partnership here, no offense to Peter De Jonge. Mr. Patterson has a definite style (Alex Cross novels) and we need to see that shine through, please."
2,Who are you and what have you done with James Patterson?,"I do not know who Peter DeJonge is, and it seems overly convenient to blame him, but this is not the James Patterson book I'm used to and enjoy. The characters are flat, the descriptions ridiculous, and the whole work shows a quite frankly annoying pattern of name-dropping. Oh yes, and I'm from Detroit too- never been shot at. Way to stereotype, guys."
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"I consider myself a fan of trash fiction like James Patterson and I generally enjoy most of his work.The Beach House, however, was one of the worst pieces of garbage I ever read. From the annoying way that the protagonist communicated directly with the reader, to the inane conversations he has with friends, to the completely ridiculous ending.I can honestly say that this is the WORST book I have ever read, the only reason I even finished it was that I was stuck on a plane with no alternative. It was that terrible. James Patterson should be ashamed of himself, and I want my 5 hours back."
2,over-hyped,This book seems to have gained popularity only because of the setting in the Hamptons. It reads like it was written for a tv movie. Wait for paperback.
1,What a waste--don't bother,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was the most corny and predictable plot I have encountered since middle school. I had never read Patterson before, but having heard such great things and seeing that he is always on the best sellers list, I decided to give this a try. What a complete waste of time. I thought it stunk a few chapters in. but continued because I thought it would get better. It never did, and in fact, it got worse and more unrealistic as the plot went on. The latter parts of the book are cheesier than a soap opera. I don't want to give anything away in case someone out there is crazy enough to want to waste their life away, but the ending is absolutely ridiculous. Please don't buy this book. Do something productive with your life and read something that you won't have figured out in the first 10 pages."
4,Good revenge story,"I finished The Beach House in 3 days, which is fast for me. I found it engrossing and entertaining. The cruelty of the rich and powerful family in the Hamptons section of Long Island begs for retribution, and by the end of the story it happens in full measure. The method by which justice is served may be a little far-fetched, but it certainly is fun. I don't understand all of the negative reviews. Obviously, the readers went in with false expectations and failed to enjoy watching the story unfold."
4,Good Read!,"Wow! I've read most of Patterson's books and this one somehow slipped through the cracks, until now. This book's ending is so completely unexpected, I almost emailed him to see how he came up with it. Wow!!!! S.L. Chessor, author of Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers and My Tongue Fell Out. Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers: A Poetry Collection"
4,Audio CD Review; Always Good,"I've listened to quite a few of Patterson's books on Audio, and I enjoy the little background scenarios that are sometimes created with music, or various sound effects; the stories are solid and I feel something is lost by dissecting them or their characters. We enjoy and return to Patterson's books because we know they are reliable and we won't be let down. That said, I have one issue which relates ONLY to the audio versions and not the books themselves: PLEASE make sure your pronunciations of unusual-sounding names or places is correct! The Long Island town of Ronkonkoma, for example; to see it in print is no problem, but to hear it repeatedly mispronounced made me crazy and truly detracted from the moment. (The accent belongs on the 2nd syllable, not the 3rd...)"
2,James Patterson is NOT John Grisham,"But he tries to be in this book. It doesn't work. The usual twist and grabbers aren't there, the ""courtroom"" seen is fine, but it dosen't keep you at the edge of your seat like most of his writings. Either wait for the paperback or get it from the library."
1,Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover (or synopsis),"When I saw this book in the store and read the set-up for the plot, I anticpated a great read. Instead, this book was so bad I almost wanted my money back. I felt cheated. The dialogue was wooden, characters one dimensional and unbelievable. The story lacked credibility in the early stages -- one would have to believe that the entire town and a prestigious law firm for no motive whatsoever was involved in a massive cover-up -- and then amazingly became just totally absurd.My morals don't permit me to reveal the ending of this book (or any book) but if it could save one person from reading this book I might make an exception because it was so ridiculous. What were they thinking???P.S. If I could give this zero stars I would."
2,Weak and disappointing,"Although I am a fan of James Patterson,especially the Alex Cross series, I could barely get through this novel. The plot lacked depth, and the ending was predictable. The style of writing was also not worthy of a best selling author."
5,nobody does it better,As always James Patterson can keep you up all night with his amazing storys and the unexpected twists.I would defenitly recommend this book.
3,A Really Good Summer Read,"I started this book on a Saturday and finished it the next day. It was exciting, interesting, and a lot of fun to read. It centers around the Hamptons and an almost cliche tension between wealthy vacationers and the townies, throwing in a ""local boy on his way to the big time"" undertone.Make no mistake--this is not Nathaniel Hawthorne and strains to even be on par with Grisham. The final third or so of the book requires an incredible suspension of disbelief. Still, the story is enticing enough to keep you turning pages up until to the end."
2,Not One of His Best,"Read several of his books and kind of enjoyed most. This last one was hard to get through. Good plot delivered with no substance. To flat including the so called ""romance"" which would've been better left out.Hope his next book is more enjoyable."
3,A Page Turner,"The plot is fairly simplistic. The characters could be more developed. However for some reason I could not put the book down. If you are looking for brain dead fun reading, this could be the book for you."
1,I got a prize for finishing this book,"I got the pleasure of kicking it around the room while yelling, (...)The characters are cartoons, the plot trite and contrived, the shocking wind-up so lame that General Hospital actually lifted the ""best"" parts of the final chapters. The sex reads like a gross-out jokes book, and the violence is not even interesting enough to be considered gratuitous.The only explanation I have for this miserable work is that somebody had a contractual obligation to fulfill and was feeling a little passive-aggressive.Skip reading it. Go straight to the kicking it around the room part."
1,This book is an insult to any intelligent reader,The book is extremely weak. It takes the reader through a plot of interesting characters with a somewhat believable story until the last several chapters. At this point it seems that a six year old was consulted to define the end of the book. It makes no sense and becomes extremely poor. I was so angry that someone would expect me to believe such rubish that I did not finish reading the book. I would not even recommend it as a free gift to anyone. I will never buy another book by this author. Back to Grisham!!!
1,Don't Bother,"I got this book from the library which is the only way to go if you want to waste your time. Silly plot, no character development, and not even a good beach read."
1,Beach House,"I just preordered Patterson new book, so I have not totally given up on him. What a waste of my time and money ""Beach House"" was. I thought I was the only one that did not like it, until I read the reviews on this page. I'm so glad it wasn't just me who thought this book was awful. Do authors get lazy, or just need a room addition?"
2,All Wet,"This novel starts out promising with likeable characters and an intriguing plot. But the first clue that the authors (yes, plural, why does it take two people to churn out this stuff?) are taking a day at the beach instead of working hard at quality writing comes with a hurricane three months out of hurricane season. The story then degenerates into the improbable and from there to the implausible and finally to the incredulous. Nothing in the second half of this book could possibly ever happen in real life. If you like stories that resemble some aspect of realism, take your towel to another beach."
2,A great disappointment!,"The plot was shallow, the characters not developed well, and the double spaced large type and empty pages convinced me that this was a case of fooling the reader into buying a real book. Very amateurish, not at all like other Patterson books. Do we get a refund for no customer satisfaction?"
3,The Beach House,There was entirely too many white pages. It was often redundant. The ending was not believable and neither were the characters. I was disappointed in this one.
1,Beach House,"What colossal TRIPE! I cannot believe that the author of ""Along Came a Spider"", ""Kiss the Girls"", and ""Jack and Jill"" is responsible for this waste of print. The characters are predictable, the plot immature and totally unbelieveable. But, then again he did write, ""When the Wind Blows,"" a poor attempt at the Dean Koontz style. ""Beach House"" is the pitiful result of trying to emmulate John Grisham's style except it has none of the characters, story, etc...Truly Disappointing."
1,Glad I didn't buy it.,I almost bought this book when it first came out. Glad I didn't. Very disappointing from this author. Very badly written with no substance. Probably the worst book I have read in the past year.
1,For the 50-cent table,"My favorite author has run out of steam! His co-author does not, repete, does not have the Paterson style. After sampling this ""tandemly""-wriiten book, it becomes obvious that this is a time-waster. Even the editing is bad. I didn't feel guilty about not finishing it. It's headed for the community library's monthly book sale--fifty cent table."
3,Not my fav,"I'm a huge James Patterson fan. This book falls a bit short at the end. Started off great, then lost a bit of sizzle. My guess is James wrote the first half and the co author the 2nd? It's not horrible, just not one of his best. If you're a newcomer to his work, I'd suggest starting off with his Alex Cross or Women's Murder Club series. They can't be beat."
1,The Blech House,"This is my first Patterson novel and I will have to say, probably my last. This story could have been written by an aspiring high school writer. The plot is as predictable and formulaic as words in a dictionary and the ending is off the chart ludicrous.Sigh, that's 3 hours worth of reading I'll never get back."
1,It's Just Bad,"I won't bore anyone with a plot summary. I believe you can find that in the publisher's notes above. The setting of the story (the Hamptons) is very interesting. The characters of the story are intriguing and the character `Maclin' in well written. The plot has promise but the book degenerates into predictable melodrama. The circumstances of the story move from being suspect to outlandish. Somewhere around chapter sixty-three, I started wondering if this was a screenplay for a soap opera.Save your time and money. There is a lot of fiction out there that is much better."
2,"If your for a quick fix-easy read, this is for you....","....if you are looking for a book with substance where you feel for the characters, any type of emotion is elicited, or you get so into it that you can't put it down...KEEP AWAY. The book starts out in the first person of the main characters brother and then switches from first to third person constantly. You feel no emotion toward the main characters and the writing is quite shallow. However, the last 50 pages (out of about 300) is relatively suspenseful and somewhat interesting. It almost seems as if Patterson knew the book was flat, so he added illicit sexual escapades to make a weak attempt to reel readers in."
3,The first half is great!,"For the first half of the book, I was sure I was going to love it. It had all the makings of a great who-dunnit. But the second half became so far-fetched that it bordered on the ridiculous. Give the readers some credit for a modicum of intelligence! I'm not sorry I read it but I'm sorry that it didn't live up to my expectations. I usually enjoy James Patterson."
4,Not your typical Patterson,"I've read some reviews that mention this is different from other books by James Patterson. I agree with that assessment, but don't agree that this is a bad thing. James Patterson's solo novels are very good, but also very intense and graphic. Beach house was a lighter book than other Patterson novels I've read, but it captured my interest at the start and I finished the book in 2 days. Beach House is an ensemble thriller and all the characters, both good and bad, were well written and consistent. I rated the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the ""courtroom"" drama of the last part of the book was over the top. But I still couldn't wait to finish the story."
3,"Silly stuff, this","This book begins as one of Patterson's trademarke mindless reads. I love a good mindless read sometimes as they do wonders for clearing out all of the cobwebs in my brain dedicated to serious matters.Beach House whipped along quickly, suspense building, carrying the reader along on a brother's quest to bring justice to the dearly departed when the whole story just gets stupid. By the end of this book, I wasn't sure if I should just laugh, or laugh really hard."
2,A Quick Read,"I needed a book for a train trip and this fit the bill. I liked the way the small chapters kept me more motivated to read. The book is interesting and quirky. I never expected the ""dramatic turn"" of the ending. However, Peter's secret life left me feeling a little uncomfortable and I hadn't expected to have to wade through that scenario to satisfy my curiosity as to how the characters fared in the end."
3,"It was alright for ,,,,,,,,,","This story was all right for someone who is just reading James Patterson for the first time. I have been reading his books for years and trust me, this is not one of the best. The story line kept me page turning and I'm happy for that. Step your game up Mr. Patterson on those Alex Cross stories. Peace."
3,BY James Patterson & Peter De Jonge?,"I think Patterson could have done without the help. I like Patterson's style and move-along plots. This plot however, with the autopsy on Peter's body getting passed off as a drowning-suicide, was a disappointment. The rich buy the courts, but not with the kinds of evidence the coroner presented. The ending really frosts the cake when they have their ""Kangaroo Court"" in the abandoned Beach house over a two-day span. Since it wasn't terrible, I can only give three stars.J. P. Landry, author of Hazard 666"
2,Hard to believe its a Patterson book!,"What a waste of time spending that much time, then to have an ending that doesn't make sense at all!! Feel that I wasted my time and money on this one. After recently readingJudge and Jury , hard to believe its written by same person. If you want a good one, pick up Judge & Jury."
2,"Decent start, weak ending",The story begins with a good setup that made it hard to put down. Then nothing happens for 100 pages and the ending is totally ridiculous. Not worth the time.
3,Didn't measure up,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson, but this book didn't measure up to his previous books. I can usually finish a Patterson novel in an evening, this one took almost 3. It was not a fast paced, page turner. Although this book had an explosive ending, I did guess the identity of the killer. Overall, I was disappointed in this book."
2,Obviously not really written by Patterson,"I'm crazy about Patterson's books - can't wait until the next one comes out. But this one - I read about 25% of it and gave up. Ho hum, not worth finishing. It is very obviously Patterson letting another writer ""do his thing"" and use his name and fame. Didn't work."
4,Suspense in the Hamptons,I was reluctant to read a book co-authored. I feel a lot are doing this to get the secondary writer started. I was surprised. I enjoyed the book and felt the mingle of the two writers were a sincere delight.I would recommend it to anyone that has enjoyed Patterson in the past would enjoy this book.
2,This is not the James Patterson I know,"The BEACH HOUSE, touted as the #1 New York Times Bestseller, is probably one of the poorest reads I have suffered through in years. The writing is immature and juvenile. The characters are poorly developed and incredibly shallow. The addition of the ever-present and always stupid local town cop does nothing to help this offering. I have long been a Patterson fan and can only suspect that this lightweight invention differs from his customary style because it is co-authored.In conclusion, if you never made it past the ninth grade you might find this book a challenging thriller. If, however, you have some appreciation of a truly fast-moving chill thrill, that is well written, AVOID THIS BOOK!"
2,Oh Mr. Patterson! WHAT HAPPENED?!,"ABYSMAL! ""Beach House"" was a slow-moving, transparent book with precious little character development. The men of the Mullen family are unlikeable. Apparently one of them's been up to no good because he gets murdered. His brother and grandfather attempt to prove he wasn't a victim of accidental drowning.Of course, Brother Jack Mullen has been sleeping with Dana, scion of only THE wealthiest and most powerful family in East Hampton (the Mullens are lower-middle-class townies). See where this is going? Boredomville. Dana is a phony. Her parents are behind the murder. Bad rich people. Virtuous poor folk. Sickeningly predictable.Mr. Patterson, you write far better fiction when left to your own devices. I anxiously await your next Alex Cross novel."
2,Beach House - Not my favorite by a long shot,"I just never got into this book. I'm an avid fan of James Patterson's books... I've purchased so many at airports across the country it is almost comical.But this one never really drew my in like most others. There just wasn't enough depth to any of the characters and their relationships to each other were missing something. And the ending just did not make sense. I didn't feel there were enough clues to lead me to say ""aha"" at the end.Short story - I was disappointed. I won't quit reading... just disappointed in this yarn."
2,I'm not cheering,"The jacket of this novel promised I would be cheering at the end - but I wasn't. The concept here is that a young lawyer, frustrated by a justice system that has allowed his brother's killer to remain free, kidnaps the parties involved and televises a multi-day trial of his own in order to convict the killer in the court of public opinion.This is just ridiculous. The final ""courtroom scenes"" are hard to believe, and the notion that the authorities wouldn't be able to trace the source of the television signal over course of the trial is preposterous. It is impossible to believe that such a hair-brained idea could ever work and no reasonably intelligent young lawyer would think that it could.Of course, in Patterson's novel it does work (that's where the cheering comes in). Patterson has written some decent novels but this isn't one of them"
3,next Hollywood movie,"It took me a few days to finish, it was really good. The ending was unrealistic, as if they wrote it so it can be made into a movie. This is my first Patterson book, it won't be my last."
1,The Title was the only good thing about this book!,As many have warned don't waste your money or your time on this book - it was my first Patterson Book and frankly I am scared to try any others!! I am a big time lover of the town of Montauk where part of the story takes place and he almost ruined that for me also (If I see Patterson on the street I will have to turn the other way - I really don't think he could have written one word of this book (Maybe he just came up with the title???)
1,What's happened to James Patterson?!,"Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, Cradle and All, some of James Patterson's first books (or least the first ones I read) were all excellent! I was hooked! The character development and believability of his story lines kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. The last few novels, however, have become more and more mundane and lack imagination. The Beach House will be the last book I buy or read. The characters are boring and contrived as is the plot. Actually I find it downright silly! Why is James Patterson writing so poorly these days? What happened?"
1,An endurance test,"I don't think I've ever had to suspend disbelief as much or as many times as I did while reading this book. I mean, this book was really, really bad. It was so bad that I had to keep reading to see if it could get worse. And it did, consistently!I went ahead and finished it anyway, hoping for something redeeming toward the end. I assure you that that 'something' never appeared.I work in a library and this book was in the discard pile so I took it home. Now I see why it was there in the first place."
3,Average James,"This story wasn't bad, but the narrator's reading was too slow and made it feel somewhat boring. The second half livened up a bit and finally piqued my interest, but getting to the second half was tough. I think I would have enjoyed this story much more had I read it myself rather than listened to the audio version. I call it simplistic as a story, the narrator was below average, and overall, this was an average story to HEAR."
3,Somewhat of a Disappointment in the End,"This is the first Patterson novel I've read so I wasn't quite sure of what to expect from the author(s). However, the book caught my attention quickly and I read the entire novel on my drive to Utah this summer. I thought the book started out great and it had a very interesting story line. Unfortunately, in the end, the story came crashing down rather quickly and left me disappointed. The ending was not realistic and really let me down because the novel had such a good story line the entire way through and I felt it was ruined in the end."
1,Waste of Time,"I found this book to be a waste of time. It was predictable and very far-fetched. In his desire to create a happy ending for the book, the author allowed credibility to fly out the window. The dialogue was downright silly at times... No one really talks like this! Flowery language belongs in romance novels, not mystery books. When I was finished with this book, I felt a mix between bitter and relieved. Try something else!"
4,loved the ending,"It was a great book. Through the first half and almost through three quarters of it I was beginning to get frustrated that Jack knew his brother was murdered, he was beaten, his grandfather threatened & friends tortured and he was not doing much in my opinion. Then in the end he surprised me. Just what I was hoping for! He and his friends had a brilliant revenge that left me not wanting to put the book down. It was a great. All along I felt like I knew what Jack might do for revenge. But I was wrong! All of a sudden the book escalated and the revenge surprised me. I was not able to the put the book down until the end. It was a great ending. Surprising and I enjoyed the twist of events."
1,Beach House,Was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of James Patterson's books and look forward to his next one. I felt this book was very boring and slow moving.
1,Will the real James Patterson please stand up?!!,"I have read every book James Patterson has written and thoroughly enjoyed each one. That's why I was so surprised with Beach House. The print was large with lots of space between lines--and plenty of end of chapter pages with just three lines. Has Patterson joined the league of other writers who after writing may best sellers, just write books to fulfill their contract? I hope not.If you want a very fast read with one-dimensional characters and a non-plausible plot and ending--then this book is for you."
2,For Patterson fans only,"Some close friends of mine gave me very stong reviews of this book and encouraged me to read it. I finally got around to borrowing a copy from the library, and I was excited to get started. By the time I finished, though, I felt very disappointed in what I had expected to be a great book... at best, I'd say this book is AVERAGE.The plot was somewhat unbelievable and overly dramatic; reading it felt like a low-budget tv soap. The characters not very interesting, and the ending was downright stupid. I would go into more detail, but spoilers would negate any remote reason to spend time reading this book.For the Patterson fan--sure. But if you're just trying to kill time (i.e. reading for general entertainment purposes) I'd say pass this one up for something more engaging."
3,Unrealistically dramatic outcome,"A young man dies while working a party at a millionaires house in the Hamptons, and his brother knows it was murder, rather than the suicide the police rush to judge. But why? It takes a while for the reader to discover the motive behind the crime. Meanwhile, some Mafia hitman type thug is running around scarring the old gang of friends of the deceased. The last 100 pages of this books enters bizarre drama, which could never occur in real life. Nevertheless, it was entertaining to an extent."
2,Not a show stopper,"I am admittedly not an avid (novel) reader. A book needs to ""suck me in"" within the first chapter, or its in danger of being tossed aside out of distraction with life, but I was stuck in an airport with this book and for a change, got beyond the first chapter as a result of lack of options. The writing was not stellar, and seemed to lack maturity. The read was quick, thankfully, but it didn't really do much for me. The characters were not particularly well developed and the story-line was average."
2,Co-Authoring is not so hot,"I LOVE the Alex Cross and Murder Club books by James Patterson, but these co-authored books are almost not worth the reads. I've been listening to this book on audio tape and even the reader is boring. This is one that you want to skip, it's just too convoluted and doesn't keep your interest. Please James, stick with Alex Cross and the Murder Club girls...the rest just ain't so hot!"
4,Great book,Really enjoyed this book. James Patterson will never let you down. Can not wait to start on the next one.
3,Easy read,Book was an easy ready but not very compelling. This is the first of Patterson's books I have read and I will try another.
5,Great book!,Loved this book. So many unexpected turns and so many ups and downs. Well worthy my time. Highly recommend it.
4,Great Romantic Suspense Novel,"I don't know what the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly could have been thinking when he/she so thoroughly trashed this novel. It is delightful! Isabelle is a great heroine that most young, working women can identify with and the Becky Beldon Multimedia spoof of Martha Stewart Omnimedia is hilarious. The suspense portion of the plot is well done and a genuine puzzle, unlike so many other books in this category. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the romance portion of the book is written somewhat oddly/awkwardly but still, this is a great book when you are looking for something fun to read."
3,had potential,"This book consists of 47 chapters and doesn't start picking up until chapter 29! It really lacks action. It also tries to end the same way it begins, reminiscent of 'The Outsiders'. I would really like to recommend that the author read the 'The Outsiders' to find out how to write some really good action."
3,A good summer read,"This was my first read by this author. I wanted an easy, no-thought book for the beach and that is just what I got. While I usually enjoy a more thought-provoking mystery, this book was just under that. It did provide some humor and was very light. For those that want a mystery that keeps you guessing until the end, look elsewhere. Overall, a great book for lazing by the pool or taking to the beach."
2,Did a Writing 101 student write this book?,"This book is really, really not good. Topping my list of complaints is how thinly the characters are written. One character is not distinguishable from the next. The plot is not well developed and unbelievable. My biggest complaint (and this goes back to the characters) is what a miserable heroine Isabelle is. She radiates dullness and doesn't really do anything. This book really does appear to be the effort of a writing student, and I couldn't help but think, ""How was this book ever published?"" I gave this 2 stars only because it was published, so maybe there's some greatness here that I don't see, and also because Ms. Bloom does appear to catch up a little towards the end of the novel.Bottom line, you will be disappointed."
4,THESE TWO BIZARRE FOPS REALLY KNOW FURNITURE,"Honestly these two guys make my skin crawl, but they really know their furniture, they are like encyclopedias of knowledge, not quite the great Albert Sack, but getting there. This is a very interesting book on some amazing furniture, and the stories are amazing. These guys really have an eye for a treasure I must admit, but i cant help shaking the image of them on their show, they are just really odd, like some old money WASP, from Newport or Long Island, I have a feeling in thirty years they will have their own Grey Garden."
1,Disappointing read,"I looked forward to this book but found it sorely lacking.My biggest gripe is that the brothers jump in a few pages from their modest upbringing to b ig shot dealers wheeling and dealing million(s) dollars items, There is no discussion of how this jump was made, or how they could manage to finance the huge purchase prices they describe. Further the books deals in antiques that only the top .00001 percent of the population could actually buy. Nor is there anything about the business end of things, like how one becomes a top line dealer.Instead of focusing on real tips and experiences acquiring items that a serious (middle class) collector could hope to acquire, they focus on items that most millionaires would find expensive.Don't expect this book to have any relevancy to you."
3,"two personalities, one obsession","Some people just seem fated for a certain type of life. It calls them early and never lets go. So it seems the Keno twins were called to American antiques. They started precociously young, buying and selling while still in their early teens and writing up their results in a shared diary. Later their paths diverge a bit, and they have their own styles and areas of specialty but the passion and the thrill of the hunt remains the same. The book is full of images of some of their finds and many stories of big auction results. The depth of their shared knowledge and their unending excitement for their work makes for pleasant reading. it's not a world changer of a book but it's nice way to spend an afternoon."
3,"A Story, Not a Guide","The Keno twins are polite, affable, easy to listen to and very knowledgeable about their subject. So its difficult not to like the book. The problem is that is doesn't really deliver what the title promises. There are wonderful tales of how the twins became involved in antiques, how they learned the trade, and some of their more famous finds.This is not to say there is nothing to be learned here; indeed there are tidbits for the snooping collector, but not nearly enough for the price. Buy this one for the telling, not instruction. I beleive there is a book entitled, ""Is it Fake?"" - or a similiar name, that is the best instruction book on looking for real vs fake treasures.If you want something appraised, the Keno boys are excellent; writing books is not their forte."
5,STREET CREDIBILITY,"......this CD is a must have for anyone who enjoy's the GO GO'S, especially for those of us so.cal. natives who were there at those early shows. The GO GO'S always had amazing energy at those shows, heck, there were ALWAYS mosh pits at GO GO'S shows!!I think the candy coated image that the record company came up with was wrong, they should have remained themselves. But I think at that time, they didn't look at street credibility as a positive force for pop record sales. Unfortunately, their image overwhelemed the music, which I feel was one of the main reasons the band fell apart. People dismissed them as a bubble-gum flash in the pan sort of thing. This CD is the TRUE GO GO'S, and hopefully when people listen to this, the GO GO'S will get the credibility they REALLY deserve, as the first ever grrrl power band, long before that term was ever coined."
3,Good and bad,"Upside: Strong song selection. B-sides and new songs are dandy. Rarities are there, if you're into that. Downside: Early ""punk"" songs are too lo-fi to bear repeated listening. Live versions of hits are generally inferior to the studio version. Bottom line: If you've got all the CDs and want a few rarities and alternate versions of some songs, it's great. If you are looking for a comprehensive collection that'll suffice in place of their 3 CDs, this won't cut it. I'm going to sell it back and get them instead."
2,"This is documentary recording, not music.","This CD is not what music listener expected, instead please look at other album like: Go-Go's Collection. If you just want to collect a documentary recording like your president speech, or something like historical event, it's OK to buy this CD, but if you want to listen to hi-quality recording that music to your ears, this CD is absolutely [poor].My conclusion:Performance: [5 stars] this is the Go-Go's as you knowQuality: [1 star] you can throw this kind of recording to recycle binPresentation: [3 stars] so so cover design"
5,Satisfying and leaves you wanting more,"This double cd is incredibly satisfying for fans of the Go-Go's. Starting with early unreleased live performances from their punk-styled roots, moving through to the solid sounds of the Talk Show LP, and ending with 3 great new tracks, the set leaves you hoping for much more new material from the band. The Valley of The Go-Go's has never been better!!!"
5,Rohinton Mistry,"I love this book and have read it 5 times and lent it to various people who never give it back. And I can understand why! I have bought 3 copies so far. Beautiful human, family stories."
5,Review Tales from Firozsha Baag,"An excellent collection of often quirky, often bitter-sweet stories of a very different culture and in some instances a different time. Mistry has a lovely cross-cultural way of writing and his western influence is clear. A great book which I use for teaching short texts with depth. Alan - Auckland NZ"
1,"Old stock from 1975, low quality paper, don't buy it.","This is a dissapointing book, the manufacturing and paper is of the lowest quality. I sent mine back. The print is small and not very legible."
2,Even the Great Ones have Off Days,"While I Consider R.Kelly The Greatest in Music, these type of Songs get on my nerve.it was cool on ""Fiesta"" but these Songs don't do much for me.they each have some cool parts but they are One&the same.it's ok for a Album track but not a Jam I fully feel.I can't wait until ""Step in the Name of love"" is released.the Re-Mix Alone is the Song of the Year to Me.While I feel Kells is the Baddest Cat in the Game&Can't Be Faded these two tracks don't do much for me.interesting Videos though.I Can't wait for the Hits though Coming Soon.03 is His year easily.Prolific&Productive.this Brother is the SHO Nuff Truth Musically but these Tracks don't Showcase it fully."
1,kelly is smoking saome primo,I think kelly's legal drama is taking their toll on the man this is pitiful.
5,"U.S. BOMBS REVIEW, SK8 HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Best U.S. Bombs record since their last one. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you don't like the U.S. Bombs . . . then you don't like punk rock. You won't stop listening to this one. SK8 HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I hope this book can help others,"I purchased this book, because I wanted to learn what it takes to make a marriage last. I grew up in a home of multiple divorces and my husband grew up in a home with very unhappy marriage that turned to divorce. So, if we learn how to love from what we see, these experiences would make my husband and I relationship retarded.I had high high hopes for this book(I love Dr Phil's show), but when I continued to read and answer questions I could not help to think when is this book going to get to something that is going to help me, or change the way I relate to others. It never came. I apparently answered all the fill in the blank questions wrong. Whenever I went to evaluate them the things I wrote down had 100% nothing to do with what the question should have triggered in me.Maybe I am too far from normalcy for this book's seemingly narrow confines, to assist me."
1,Not his best,"This book is not what it is hyped to be, Not very informative and not what I thought it would be."
4,Oldie But Goodie. Love him or hate him this is a good source of information.,"Dr. Phil. Love him. Hate him. Or both, I can't deny this information is helpful concise and a great reference for jumping off the ideas to formulate your own or to reflect on things and principles that are effective."
4,Nice book.,I found this book to be very helpful at focusing on my relationship issues with my wife. It is essential that both parties be involved.
5,"Real, life changing help! Struggling or thriving relationship can benefit!","This program can turn a sour relationship, revive a mundane, and inspire an already great one. I recommend this book to all my friends, especially those who are struggling in their relationship. Do the work and reap the benefits. It is a truly amazing & life changing program no matter what state your relationship is in. I purchased two books & my spouse & I worked the program together. Dr. Phil makes it clear that you alone can make positive changes, even if you work it alone. This program is written in an easy to understand manner and can make for a better life. The sooner you begin, the sooner the benefits!"
4,Relationship Rescue,Dr. Phil does an excellent job in teaching couples the how to's of getting their relationship back on track. I would have given it 5 stars IF it didn't have all the therapist bashing in it.Dr. Phil speaks as if every therapist on the planet is ineffective and unhelpful. Lets get real. There must be a few who do a good job. The hostility toward therapists was very distracting to an otherwise very good read.
5,Great book...,"I bought this book after my husband ""almost"" left me & my son for another woman. Since I thought everything was back to normal, I kept the book in my drawer & left it unread for 3 months. Then suddenly, my husband wanted ""out"" again... and he said, that this time, ""it's for good"". There is no other woman involved (not to my knowledge) but he thinks it's over between us. After few sleepless nights without him, I thought that I would need a book to read... and I found this book again in my drawer. I started reading it... and still reading it (almost finished). The book is helping me not only to rescue my marriage but to better myself... and ifever my husband and I will not end up together... I will be ""practicing"" what I am learning from this book... The book is absolutely to make myself a better person not only to my partner but also to my son, family & friends."
2,Didn't read all of it,"A little boring, but overall it has some good information in it to take to heart. Good for the price."
3,More relationship help,"""Relationship Rescue"" is helpful and it whets your appetire for more information. Try ""Relationship Pain"" by Ralph Schillace,Ph.D. for a more challenging consideration of relationship issues in romantic, family and work situations. After the rescue find relationship health and joy."
5,Awesome book for a strained relationship!!!,"This is a wonderful book and it will definitely help a suffering relationship if both parties will work at it. And I mean REALLY work at it. My only disappointment is the vendor I purchased it from. I ordered 2 copies so my husband and I would each have a copy to write in and make personal notes. The 2 copies I received are different sizes. Don't get me wrong, it's the same book, but we are referencing pages to one another and it's kinda hard to do when when you are talking about is on a different page in his book. Otherwise, excellent purchase. Now I can return the copy I borrowed from the library. :-)"
4,Tells it like it is,"This book is a little difficult to get into as he is pretty tough to begin with. He really cuts the ""c___"" and tells it like it is. NO mollycoddling. But, it is worth it if you can get through the first couple of chapters. If you can't, this won't work for you anyway. Instead of worrying about the why's and whine's he goes to the solutions that he thinks will work. It is not an easy fix type of book at all, but if you have a relationship that needs work and you are willing to work at, this is a great help."
5,"Saved me, save my marriage","I have read and re-read this book. The clarity and common sense approach offered here is so intuitively obvious upon reading I almost felt ashamed not understanding before. Not only is it well presented, Dr. Phil serves as effective cheer-leader along the way making one understand how empowered we are. Everything is possible, everything is in reach. The steps are presented logically and he helps the reader reason through common pitfalls. He helped me change me and my mindset in ways that had results within weeks and prepared me for coming decades of love."
4,Practical.,"""Life Strategies"" isn't ""great literature"" of the Shakespeare calliber, but if you need some direction with dealing directly and fearlessly with several common ""life challenges"", this might be a good book for you. McGraw talks ""tough,"" forcing the reader to get past his or her false hopes and self-deceptions. When a ""coach"" is needed to get a person going, McGraw is one of the best. A better book for those who are deeper thinkers about life-issues is ""Castle of Wisdom"" by Rhett Ellis of course because it is more spiritual, not quite as practical, but more powerful on the deeper levels. Still, for a simple and direct approach, go with McGraw."
3,nothing shocking,"The information presented within the book seems to have been taken from other programs and books. Nothing new here. It is basically a rehashing of what others have been saying for years. I was surprised at the similarities to others' work. I thought Dr Phil was an original. Maybe he is, just not in this area."
5,Insightful and Well Worthwhile for Anyone,"Relationship Rescue is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to improve their relationship. Even those couples fortunate enough to be in a very solid relationship can benefit greatly from this book. If you make the effort, you will gain valuable insight into both yourself and your partner. This book is the real deal, not like those Mars and Venus books. I would also recommend the novel Fried Calamari to anyone looking for a funny and insightful look at the different ways men and women view sex and relationships."
3,Relationship Rescue: Book,It was a gift so I have no idea how to rate the item. It was sent on time and assume it arrived on time. Sorry. Can there be a different way to rate an item that is not sent to the purchaser?
5,Thank you for putting it on Kindle!,"I haven't even started reading it yet, but I am so thrilled it is on Kindle now!! We have 2, and now we can read it it the same time!! Thank you!!"
5,Great book,"I bought this book to work on my relationship, duh! I have always been a fan of Doctor phil because he is very educated in his profession. He is a wonderful book writer and gets across some very valid and eyeopening points. He really helps you figure out what is behind your anger and identify what it is you truly want out of your significant other. I would recommend this book only to those who want to look at how they are contributing to the issues in there relationship. You are only in control of yourself."
3,Problem of Nonparticipating Spouse,"Early in the book, Dr. McGraw demands that you improve yourself if you want to improve your relationship. His ideas for self improvement are good. However, later in the book, Dr. McGraw assumes that your spouse can be persuaded to join you in participating in Dr. McGraw's relationship improvement steps. Unfortunately, some spouses have no interest in participating in these steps. Dr. McGraw fails to adequately address this problem in his book."
2,"If you've read ""Life Strategies"" don't bother","If you've already read ""Life Strategies"", you'll find this very heavy on repitition, not just in terms of general themes (e.g you have to insist that others respect you) but even the case studies and examples McGraw uses. It seems as if he took the core of ""Life Strategies"", added on one good additional chapter, and proceeded to publish. If you haven't read McGraw's other book, you'll certainly enjoy and benefit from either of the two. He's straightforward and certainly in your face the whole time. In both books, he could be more expansive on how you get things done, even if you know what you want to do. Using the previous example, it is one thing to say ""insist that others respect you"", but how you get insensitive folks to actually do so is more difficult, so more elaboration on the actual how to's would help."
3,Not really Tribal,"This is a nice collection House music, but technically it's not Tribal. Popular club tunes that you can find on many compilation CDs. Still, it is good music to get you dancing."
5,Gorgeous book!,"I am so pleased with the gorgeous fine art in this whole series of small books (I bought all 3). This one has particularly fine art reproductions. Buyers, just be aware this book series are all rather small books but very well bound. I was a little surprised when I received the first one because I had not noted the book dimensions. But I was so pleased that I went ahead and bought the other 2."
4,Good but small,"If you love botanical illustrations you will love this book, but it is so small. I would love to see it twice as larger. Anyway, it is shrink-wrapped so that is really neat."
2,Straps are wacky...we returned it!,"We were hoping that this seat would work for us as due to its moderate size, Consumer Reports recommendation (this is actually a more deluxe version than the one CR lists), Baby Bargains rating (B+), and great price. We also liked the easy recline for rear facing (although we did have to tinker with the installation to ensure that my 7 month old could sleep well without her head flopping) and cup/toy storage holders. BUT, the straps were twisting constantly, did not adjust uniformly (one shoulder strap would sometimes loosen more than the other), and the crotch strap, while adjustable, was already way too tight--no way that this seat would be able to grow with us (if only this strap was abit longer...); the harness closure was also difficult to open and close, or at least not as smooth as our Graco Snugride infant carrier. We returned it for the Britax Roundabout (at double the price..ouch!) but the ease of use is like night and day."
1,Bad leg straps,"I bought this car seat after reading the Cosumer Reports findings that it was so safe. When I saw it it the store, I was pleased with how comfy it looked. But I didn't bother to check the location of the leg straps in the store. Once I got it home, I realized that the straps go over the baby's thighs, not his hips, so it digs into his legs. I can't imagine this is safe if there is an accident, plus it held his legs down making him very uncomfortable. I returned it for the Triumph - which seems to be working very well."
3,Titan Car Seat - Bronze,The seat is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She likes the attached cup holder. The one negative feature is that we have only had the car seat for 6 weeks and already the fabric underneath her legs is pilling and worn looking. I am not sure what it is made of..but I wouldn't purchase this particular fabric for a car seat again.
2,Average,"I bought this car seat for my daughter a month ago and I just returned it. At first I really liked it. It seemed really comfortable and roomy but the more and more I used it, I hated it! The straps gave me so many problems when I tightened it-the right side was always too tight around my daughter's shoulder and chest and I had to adjust them over and over each time I put her in it-very annoying! Also, I have to agree with the other parents that the straps lay weird around the hips. It seemed like my daughter was really squished around that area. I wouldn't get this car seat. The price is ideal but it really isn't that great. I just bought the newer model of the Graco Comfort Sport car seat and the ratings are really great on it. It got an A in everything on the consumer reports whereas the Evenflo Titan received a B in everything. I should have done more homework before I purchased the Evenflo Titan."
4,Great Seat for the Money,"I almost bought the Triumph brand, but chose this one instead because I have a small sedan. I am glad I did, because the Triumph would have been way too big. I have a petite daughter, so at 4 months, she fit into this seat comfortably. She loves to be able to sit up more to see the world as opposed to her infant seat where she couldn't see anything. She also loves this position as it allows her better access to her toys. Once I got the hang of the straps, everything worked very well for us (although I can see why other parents got frustrated). I did add a head support (without compromising the integrity of the seat of course) so my daughter could sleep more comfortably. We would have bought the Britax if we could have afforded it, but for the money, this was a comfortable and most importantly, safe seat for us. I found it to be a good choice for this family."
3,Good for the money but beware,"This is a really good carseat for the price. It also receives the best rating from consumer reports. My husband and I were all set to purchase it for our nine month old twins, we went to the store and discovered that to use it rear facing you need to purchase a foam piece to recline the carseat to the proper position. We tested this but felt it was not as save. It is worth the extra 40 dollars to buy one that reclines."
2,Had to take it back...,"We bought this carseat for our second child after she outgrew the Graco infant seat at 6 months. She's been riding around in it for 3 months in the rear-facing position and, like other reviewers, we found it was nearly impossible to tighten once we put her in it. My husband finally figured out it was the angle she was positioned that did not allow for the strap to tighten. My daughter is very long so her shoulders are very high above where the shoulder straps loop through the seat. We resolved to tightening the straps by pulling it from the back. Anyway, after the straps easily twisted and we found that she just wasn't sitting comfortably in it, we decided to return it and bite the bullet and pay extra for the Britax Roundabout. My son is in the Britax Marathon which is really bulky when traveling, but once you have a Britax, it's hard to switch to anything else. It's unfortunate because I really liked the design of this seat."
2,Too much of a pain to use daily,"Bought this seat, put baby in & adjusted the straps. Only one side tightened, and I had to reach under the seat to slide the strap over to tighten the other side. I figured I'd only have to do this once so long as I kept the straps in that same position. The next time I put him in the seat, one strap was very tight and the other very loose. I reached under again to even them out. This continued to happen every day or two. Returned it and bought the Britax. So far, I'm really liking it better as far as convenience goes. . ."
2,Returned,"We bought this seat as a second car seat for around town. The reviews here convinced us that the more expensive seats are worth the money if you do a lot of car travelling. The installation on the Titan was very similar to our Graco infant seat base. Very easy! However, once the seat was installed (rear facing) and our daughter put in it, tightening the system was nonexistent. We couldn't get the strap to actually tighten the shoulder harness. I think it might be made to pull straight out, like with a forward facing seat, rather than the pulling up that you have to do with a rear facing seat. We tested it uninstalled and it worked fine. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work when installed. Anyways, much too difficult for a car seat, regardless of what CR says. Also, I did notice that the straps twisted very easily. We did end up returning it because we couldn't get the system tightened when installed."
5,Beautiful,"No, its not completely true to the book. But if you love the book as much as I do, you will forgive the inconsistencies in the film and be thrilled that it is done so well. All of the actors are superb, especially Peggy Ann Garner (Francie). Her scene at the end on the rooftop is truly touching. I own it and will watch it one hundred times and never tire of it!"
3,A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"This classic movie, following the novel of the same name is one of the best ever made. A beautifully acted, heart-rending, capturing of life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s."
5,A masterpiece,"Heatbreakingly sad yet uplifting, this movie will definitely make you cry, but you'll still be glad you saw it. It is not an ordinary tearjerker -- it's unsentimental, keen-eyed, and dead accurate not only about poverty but also about family relationships. A total winner -- my favorite movie from the forties."
5,Heartwrenching and heartwarming,"This is a story that brought me back to the old familiar streets of Brooklyn and to a time in the lives of its people that will be all too familiar to its natives and will be mesmerizing to all others.This is a book you cannot put down,it will touch you in your heart of hearts and will never be forgotten.You will want your children and grandchildren to know this story as they should all other classics. END"
5,Peggy Ann Will Also Grow On You,"Too bad we had to wait for this unsung actress (Peggy Ann Garner - not the more well known Dorothy McGuire) to finally get on DVD with her dramatic masterpiece A Tree Grows In Brooklyn - for its 60th anniversary!I'll also be looking forward to the DVD release of Peggy Ann's comedy masterpiece - Junior Miss. Slap Happy New Year, everybody!"
5,this was a g ift and I was surprised at the speed of delivery,"I haven't seen this particular video but know the movie and love it, it is hard to obtain anymore"
5,a tree grows in brooklyn,"Item came on time,in very good condition,language in English and seemed to have no problems in viewing it. It's been over forty years since I last saw this movie on TV. The old classics are the best to remember."
3,A great movie but wouldn't you want some high book action?,"If you like the book you'll like this. Enough said. MAYBE... I agree with the person who gave this movie one star. Of course, I found some things relating to the book but not all, including: Evy, who is never mentioned, and it goes so far as to say SISSY IS THE ONLY OTHER ROMMELY DAUGHTER, Joanna, the girl who had a baby without being married, the pervert who strikes the neighborhood, etc.Though... the person who plays Francie is a great character, hitting Francie with the right notes I thought she'd look like, act like. Neeley is good too and I could tell who's who. But Sissy is just not how I expected... more of a 1900s' flapper than a dark haired bad girl married 3 times and having 10 kids like I expected.Good movie. Missing some parts though."
5,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,I've seen this film hundreds of times since childhood and finally obtained my own copy.Wonderful actors and great story.I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great film. I also have read the book many times. Hope you carry it. Great reading for children and adults. The DVD was purchased through one of your sellers.
4,Classic,This South Korean import from PD Entertainment is an excellent buy. The sound and picture quality are good. It's a pity that a classic film like this one hasn't been released in the United States.
3,Not worth the price!,The game is full of strategy which is fun. The game is geared toward experienced players. This is not a game for kids younger than 15-16yrs. due to the complicated aspects of the game. I found glitches in the C.D. which frustrates the player.
3,Looks a lot like 3D Assault,"I don't own this game, but just from looking at the screenshots I can tell that it looks exactly like Panzer General 3D Assault, which I do own."
1,Will not run in Windows ME,"Do not buy this if you have Windows ME, game will not run, no tech support or patches are avaliable. Website listed in game documentation doesn't exist. company which makes this game doesn't support it any more, they have either been sold, or gone out of business"
1,Do not buy this if you run windows ME,"Do not buy this game if you have windows ME, the game won't run, no tech support of any kind or patches are avaliable. SSI says they don't support the game any more."
5,Great Strategy Game,"Panzer General III displays a battlefield that will put you in the mood to form serious strategies. The game is not overly complicated but you soon learn that what seems to be the most straightforward plan of attack will not always work! It gets you to think. Decent sound effects, good unit movement, nice display."
3,Only Eastern Front,"Not like the first and second version of this series, PG 3 only guves you the estern front. So no Normandy, no Battle of Bulge. This makes the whole game a little bit short than it should be and reduce the possible fun this game should be.On the other hand, the experience and command system is very good idea to reflect not just the machine, but the man who commend the unit to make the record good or bad.Good for casual WW2 war game players. I believe most of the players are focus on the real-time games right now."
2,Not 5 Stars!,"My son is a tried-and-true train fan. He likes the pictures in the book, but I have had to modify the story to keep him interested. The text reads like a mumbled stream of consciouness. I purchased the book based on the 5-star customer rating, and was surprised and disappointed when I received it."
1,"Great work, appalling ebook","A great historical work, but appalling in this ebook format. The massive number of typos, including something very strange happening to 'f', and the poor representation of the maps make reading it painful. Those involved should be ashamed at taking a serious work and treating it with such disrespect."
2,Even More Complex than the War that it Try to Explain,"This massive book reminds me of a history by Jorge Luis Borges, where the emperor of some imaginary place try to get the most perfect possible map of his Kingdom, so he order one that fits inch by inch with the real territory. Surely you catch the idea..."
5,Enter a richly woven universe you won't want to leave!,"A lyrical and gifted storyteller, Marcellas has created a series to satisfy not only fantasy readers, but also those who enjoy historical fiction and romance. The medieval-type culture with the intricacies of High Lord politics (filled with courtiers and castellans, spies and knights) will fascinate as much as the fully-realized magical world of the sahari'a witches and the Four--the spirit dragons who guide them.You will come to care deeply for the many complex characters among the shari'a and the Allemanii, and struggle with them as they face love and hatred, fear and prejudice, honor and betrayal, compassion and hope. Read (and re-read) all 3 books in this amazing series--Mother Ocean, Daughter Sea, The Sea Lark's Song, and now Twilight Rising, Serpent's Dream--and then wait with me eagerly, anxiously and impatiently, for the next volume!"
4,Unfinished series,This is the third in an unfinished series. Although it is a great book with a wondeful heroine we may never find out how it ends. The author does not have a website so it is unclear if there will ever be another book to end the story line.
1,Calls drop,I purchased this item in last January. I worked fine for few months and then started to drop calls. I called the Uniden customer support and the reprasentative made me reset the phone. It did not help and still the calls get disconnected.
4,Nice Floodlight,This is a nice heavy duty light. It is nice an bright and the magnet is very strong and holds well to the metal on your vehicle.Would definitely recommend when you need a good light and only have 12 volt power available.
1,"A ""biker"" comments","After reading this book, and the reviews found here, I can't help but believe that all the positive reviews come from:1. Rich Urban Harley Riders2. Friends of the author3. BothThis is pretty light weight stuff that has very little to do with riding a motorcycle. But then again...there aren't a lot of motorcyclists. There are a lot of people who own motorcycles. Before you order it from Amazon.com pick the book up at your local bookstore. Glance through it. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you think $25,000 is a reasonable price for a Harley."
1,biker code review.,"this is the lamest sample, i couldn't read any part of the sample. i was very surprised."
3,"Half and half: good yeast program, bad diet for some","Dr. Young's new book is half good (his candida/yeast information), half potentially dangerous (his unbalanced diet). I discovered Dr. Young and his earlier books through a friend and loved his Candida-control program. (I had the worst candida problems while I was a fanatic Dr. Young vegetarian.)His yeast research is great, but viewing his new book, and having lived his precise diet for a time, his recommended diet just hasn't worked for me or my family. I know some people seem to thrive, and the people that work for him push the diet with a religious fervor that borders on Stepford. The diet is not for everyone, please be forewarned. I believe we are all biochemical individuals, and have found, that after a decade of vegetarianism which nearly killed me, it is a diet not ideal for all. I recommend take the first part of this book to heart, the second part with a grain of. . . ummm, salt?"
2,A broad based health cookbook,"I bought this book to read about pH and the miracle. What I got was a book of recipies using ingredients not readily available. Recipies are referenced and not listed in the index, so one must search for them. Perhaps 1/4 of the book is pertinent, the remainder is recipies i.e., healthy snacks eat 'All-Vegetable Cocktail', but in the index there is no 'All-Veg...',ad infinitum.Maybe this is a good book for a neophyte or novice to healthy eating. I got my pH right and quickly using 'The Calcium Factor', a book half the cost of this one.Nitrazine paper strips for tests of pH are not even mentioned for self testing, nor sourced. Organizational reference is not a high point of this book."
3,"pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health","A vegan solution to health with an alkaline twist; and, the Doctors blood research to back it up. His clinical results show it works on those with specific health problems. The low fat diet has the beneficial effects research has found. Young's theory, that it optimizes the body's ability to heal, and therefore can cure all health problems. A grandiose statement that begs for research."
1,References - References - References - References,"I always liked that Tim Leary quote ""Think for yourself and question authority""Thinking for yourself mean being skeptical and doing a little research.[...][...][..] *****Why Health Professionals Become Quacks:[...]"
4,"The pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health",Robert Young has a great formula and explains it in a way that makes sense. He has put a great deal of science behind his work. I have tried his life changing diet and it works!
4,BOOK,Book was received quickly and so far has all info that I expected. PH balance concept makes sense -cannot tell you if it works or not until I have tried it for several years. The recipes seem simple and tasty.
1,WORST book ever!!!,"This is the WORST book that I've ever read!!!The authors are COMPLETELY UNEDUCATED in thefields of chemistry, science and medicine.They advise their readers to DRINK HYDROGENPEROXIDE, which is a POISON and there isNO ANTIDOTE for it after ingestion. Itwill KILL the CELLS and lining of one'sstomach and ALL OTHER ORGANS, just to namea few of the serious health problems thatit will cause. ABSOLUTELY INSANE and totallyIDIOTIC!!! DO NOT BUY this MISLEADING andSO-CALLED LOUSY book. It's a BIG WASTE ofyour time and precious money!"
1,too far alternative for me,I really couldn't get past the first part of this book when he talks about human cells turning into bacterial cells into viral cells. That was just too far for me. I was quite disappointed because I think the pH theory has some clout.
2,Good general nutritional ideas gone amuck,"Contains many well corroborated general guidelines regarding improved diet and nutrition. However, the author often takes these guidelines to the extreme. Discerning readers will carefully consider his recommendations before implementing them. Yes, cooking in microwave ovens probably should be avoided especially by health compromised people but they are very much in use in Russia today- they were reinstated ten years before the copyright date. And I doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless. Also, Dr. Young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and, therefore, the validity of his dietary claims.I tried to confirm a few of his stated ""facts"" by trying them myself;I could not. Use common sense when you read about corn, peanuts, and mushrooms.I am juicing green vegetables daily and love it. I expected more from a Ph.D."
2,you need a dietician,"All this might work wonderfully if you had time to do all this stuff and manage to work out how to eat exactly the way it says, but for those of us in the real world, it's more trouble than it's worth."
2,"Good intentions, not for everyone","My wife bought this book and likes it. We bought an earlier Dr. Young book and really tried to live his extreme vegetarian program for six months. I just got sicker and weaker, bloated and always tired. My wife did really well. What was the difference?Then we discovered Dr. D'Adamo's book ""Eat Right 4 Your Type."" I discovered I was a type O, and vegetarian diets weren't right for me, my wife, a type A, could do well on a diet like Dr. Young's. She still follows Dr. Young's diet, modified by Dr. D'Adamo's recommendations, and she's thriving. I'm now lean and energetic--with Dr. D'Adamo. If you're a blood type O, watch out--Dr. Young's diet didn't work for me!"
4,Enthusiasm someimes overshadows science,"First, a disclaimer. It appears that the principle of limiting food choices in order to raise pH works. Moreover, Young's basic issues match well with other experts, such as Hyman, Fuhrman, and Ornish. I can't argue with the apparent success resulting from following Young's and those other guys' advice.So what's my gripe? Young makes some statements that are simply absurd. Every few pages he would say something that just set my teeth on edge. The most egregious statement was that sodium would convert to potassium in the body. I think he probably meant that potassium would replace sodium in some compounds in the body. But in his enthusiasm, he made a completely unsupportable claim. Several other apparently exaggerated claims are probably also due to enthusiasm.My quarrel is probably not with Young himself, but with whomever dropped the ball during the copy editing process. That's a shame because Young has workable advice to give."
5,Amazing how our body's work depending on the food we eat,"I am so glad that I purchased this book. The author is a microbiologist and really knows all about microbs and molds and fungi and bacteria and how they affect the body and either enable or destroy it. After reading the book and verifying the info I am now changing my way of life to a whole food, live food way of eating and look forward to the increased stamina and overall health and vitality!"
2,Eliminate Eliminate Eliminate.,"If one was to follow the diet laid out in this book, one would be popping supplements and guzzling green juice every hour of the day. Don't eat meat, don't eat dairy, don't eat potatoes... We humans were born on EARTH where blenders are not part of the ""natural environment"". We were given teeth to bite things and lived for thousands of years by eating plants AND animals. The reason we are getting fat and sick now is that food companies mucked around with the nature of the food we eat in order to mass produce. An apple in 1950 had 4 times more nutrients than an apple does today. We need to get back to unmodified food and this doesn't mean just eliminate all food except green vegetables cooked lukewarm. If we were meant to eat nothing but liquid we would have no teeth."
1,What,"a crock of um, oh I know, nonsense. If you want to eat more healthfully, it's pretty darm simple without buying in to extreme points of view and something that is just pushing you to buy their stuff. Yes, many non-healthy foods are acidic. So don't eat them. What you should be eating is NOT A MIRACLE - it's sensible - try and listen to your body and avoid processed anything as much as possible eat fresh, whole plant-based REAL FOOD. There - you got that for free!"
2,Expected more,"I expected more new information. Its not unlike so many health books that concentrates on more veggies, more fruit. I did learn to eat less fruit. Not enough new info worth the effort to read another ball"
2,Same old pap,The value of an alkaline diet is not disputed but Mr. Young's methods and products are not the only way of achieving the desired results.I met this author at a book signing in Honolulu and he seemed more interested in selling books and wheat grass than being open minded about other supplements. A booked called the Tao of Detox seemed more informative to me.
1,Mixing of Sincere Faith Filled Beliefs Blurs Science,"I am always confused that talented religious people feel compelled to emphasize their faith in the preamble to their NON RELIGIOUS books. I have a great respect for people of Faith. My patients though do not like books where the two are mixed, if it regards their health. I have, in the face of repeated complaints about this approach, stopped recommending books which let you know from the outset that half science, half religion are part of the message. It is an intolerance for the less Faith Filled that the Faith Filled would not accept. Is it possible to deliver the book without an introduction of Faith which is such a personal Journey anyway? Thank you, but no thank you."
3,This book was interesting- but....................,"I have been searching for the ultimate weightloss program, something that I can do, that1- won't cost me an arm and a leg2- won't take up every minute of my day thinking about it- and/or preparing for it3- has tons and tons of useless information that also will take up all of my dayWell, this book and diet has all of it. To my unhappiness!I do have to say the book explained alot about food- digestion,and how to stay healthy.The only thing that I really got out of this book was - EAT VEGETABLES, VEGETABLES- VEGETABLES- well I could have totally thought of that- who wouldn't loose weight just eating vegetables!So there goes my interest in this Miracle Diet- it is allvegetables!I would pass this one by-"
5,Makes me want to learn more about Dr. Young's alkaline diet.,"Its written for the layman to understand. I enjoy his common-sense approach to eating the alkaline vs. acidic diet. Offers more info, and supplements to aid the health-concerned reader."
2,so so,Couldn't finish this book.. the underlining pro vegan stance was too much for me.Humans are omnivore and have adapted to get nourishment from most anything. And this authors no meat ever but maybe 1 fish a month stance was too much. Here is the summery of the book - Basically just eat blended wheat grass everything else will kill you.
1,Comments by an MD who has written a textbook on acid-base,"I have looked over 'The pH Miracle' and concluded that the underlying ideas are the same as those presented in another book by Dr. Young, which is titled 'Sick and Tired.' I have published a very critical customer review of this other book at its page on amazon. Readers who are considering buying 'The pH Miracle' may wish to take a look at that review; it is dated January 27, 2004."
5,Feels great,"If you are open to truth test it, doubt it, analyze it, do your own experiments, compare with others and you will find your goal"
1,what a misleading book...forcing the vegan diet thru their so called pH miracle,"I purchased this book in hopes to get more information on both acidic and alkaline foods. I was also expecting a more scientific basis and a nice breakdown of foods. Yet, what I got from this book was nothing I can utilise...just opinionated hogwash. If you aren't a vegan and/or like fruits, legumes, grains, meats, dairy...well you won't find anything but a starvation grazing plan.I respect people for their choices of being omnivores(w/ meat, fish, poultry, nuts, dairy w/e as protein source), vegetarians (ovo and/or lacto) or vegans, since it's their choice....but don't try to force it on me. To camouflage a book as a ""balance your diet & reclaim your health"" pH resource into a vegan diet, is nothing more than a desperate scam. They could have at least added ""the vegan way to pH balance your diet"". --Then at least, I would have never bought it."
1,old quasi-science,"I was seriously disappointed by this book. Content consisted of old quasi-science and ""testimonials."" There are great resources available that are based on much newer research that are based in real science."
5,pH Miracle Revised...,"a must read.. o go read it... It is startling and accurate, but not what we have learned so we might doubt its wisdom.. Hold on: go read and consider NEW that which has been around for centuries..."
5,Living Proof Testimonial,"Maybe this book isn't as technical as some would like it to be and I agree that the recommended diet is hard to follow for a lot of people on the go BUT I am living proof that Dr. Youngs program works EXTREMELY well. By following only SOME of the principles Dr. Young recommends my life has changed DRAMATICALLY. By eliminating soda, sugar and coffee(tea) and using Super Greens religously with Biolight and Prime PH I am literally a NEW person. ...WILL change your life as well!"
4,Response to previous reviewer,"To the previous who mentioned the beneficially acid-environment in the stomach and colon:I had contemplated the same facts, and then I heard an audio interview with the author where someone raised the same point. His response was that yes, certain systems/organs in the body are acidic and are meant to be acidic (such as the stomach), while some should be alkaline, but it is the pH of the blood which is an indicator of the overall acid/alkaline state of the body, and it is the blood (referred to as the ""river of life"") that should be alkaline.Not trying to support any position, but wanted to pass along this info."
5,"The pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health","I have never been an overweight person, but I bought this book to help me adjust my diet so that I could rid myself of eczema and acne. I often forget that skin is an organ and thus needed to make certain adjustments in my diet to address those two skin conditions. This book helped me make some much needed changes to my diet, lifestyle, and how I look at food."
1,DANGER!!! BEWARE!!!,"This book nearly killed me!!!!!! I strongly suggest that anyone who is thinking of trying this diet first consult with their doctor. I did not, and I lost too much weight, became tired, disoriented, anxious, and was unable to go to work (or pretty much anywhere else) for over two months. I had several trips to the emergency room, completely lost my appetite, and am now struggling to gain some of the weight back. This diet completely disrupted the balance in my body, my brain, not to mention my life, and it is definitely not for everyone. I'm not exactly sure who it is for, but before you jump on the Ph bandwagon, consult with someone who REALLY understands nutrition."
3,there is something there but....,"there is something there but ....just doesn't get us to that point,seems like another one of those "" buy all our books"", booklet me help youeat your veggies specially leafy greens, (learn to likem if you dont)eat good quality proteinsdrink atleast 1 gallon of water a day remember if you feel thirsty your body really is asking for water not soda pop, ( sorry guys) I drink on an average day 5 qts,stay away from fast food, soda, too many starches, and junk foodexercisetake good vitamins..this is all my opinion I'm not a medical doctor,if you have questions ask your doctor.,lol yeah, yeah but in this day and age you gotta say it"
3,Eat Green Veggies and no fats etc... etc...,"this book was too complicate for me. Too manycharts with an artificial point system. Like,'come see me at 50 bucks an hour and maybeyou can figure this out...."" If i had cancer i amnot sure what i would do but this book would confusethe s*** out of me i am sure... My personal opinion only.Your results may vary."
5,Excellent book for healthy eating and losing weight!,"After reading this book, I purchased the required supplements, and both my wife and I started the PH Miracle diet together. Just 30 days later, I have lost 25#, and my wife has lost 19#. Also, I have eliminated many of my health problems, ones which the doctors were unable to fix."
5,excelent!,This book realy moves your paradigm from the closet to the street. Its something realy different that we have to apply in our lives to improve our health!
4,Human ph balance is made perfectly understandable,This is a good book with a lot of great information. So far I'm just not dedicated enough to follow the recomended diet. But I still apply a lot of the information to my daily life.
1,Utter Scam,"Robert Young is nothing more than a scam artist.The diet cures nothing, it has no scientific credibility.Everyone who thinks this is a good idea should look at this website.[...]"
2,Overpriced,"I could have bought a floor console of the same quality at K-mart for under $40. Different design, but same size, number of cup holders and amount of storage. The upper cup holder was broken off during shipping. I was able to use rubber cement to re-attach it. It does not look like much glue was used during construction of it...no wonder it came off. Quality should have been better for the price."
4,"Not their best, but far from the worst","As a long time (ten years now) fan of the lizards I have to say that Strange Noises is a continuation of what makes them the funniest band around.The title track is a tango that plays to every man's fear when it concerns ex-lovers.We only fight continues Conrad's series of drinking songs with the added twist of a female duet.Suzie Rosen's Nose is another Emily Kaitz gem. Although musically it reminds me of ""illusion travels by stock car""Why can't we Blow up Saddam is cute, but now no longer relevent. So Sad.Phill & Jessie is another slam (deservedly IMO) at some republican politicians.There is a lot to like here and I would love to know the origin of Merchant's Lunch and Bannana Slugs."
3,Quick to break!,"I really liked this product until it broke. The design is great for picking up lots of poop. As an owner of 2 dogs, I'll admit that I put this device through lots of use, but the plastic snapped at a joint near the handle. I only had it for a couple of months before that happened. I like it, but I'd prefer a more durable alternative."
2,Works well but will break...,"The design of this product with regards to its function is fairly good. It picks up the nasty little piles on your lawn with little effort. However, it will break on you. We are on our third now and am in the process of looking for something more durable. I will not buy another."
1,CHEAP!!!,"This product appeared to be a great idea and still is if it were made of a better plastic. I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought 3 of these and not one latest more then 2 months. The problem is that the plastic used is of very poor quality and tends to be very brittle and snap very easy. I have called and mailed the company to complain, but they never returned my calls or E- Mails. That tells me that they do not care or stand behind there product. I will no longer support them and buy any of there products again. Beware there are other companies out there that make the same cheap product, they are no better. There all made of the same cheap plastic."
1,Bad quality,"I had purchased several of these scoopers over the years, but the last two items were really bad. They broke within weeks. Maybe they changed the manufacturer or using different materials. For one ,the handle broke within a week and the other one lost a spring after 2 weeks. I switched to a different product, which works better and is lasting now for 3 months without problems."
1,yayyy emo!,"music died a little with the release of this album. i read some comments wherein people have the audacity to suggest that this garbage de jour is actually good--no! great music. please just crawl into a hole and remain there. you'd think with such an absolutely moronic band name like panic (exclamation point!!!) at the dico and equally moronic asinine song titles people would have the sense to avoid such trash. instead i see woww great stuff to dance to....and ""its rare too see a band with such mature and profound lyrics"" or something like that. emo (and this band) are devoid of anything resembling creativity sincerity or originality. warbly falsetto vocals typical guitar riffs drum machine trite synth lines its all here. please read pitchforks review- it made me laugh. whos up for a trip to hot topic and then a good cry over those pesky highschool crushes? meeee! oo nice bangs."
3,Love the song titles,"Judging by the reviews here, I fall in the middle. I don't think this is the greatest CD ever recorded, nor is it dog filth I scraped from the bottom of my shoes. Wow, some people really hate this band. I like the originality of their band name and the song titles/lyrics. I'm tired of the minimalist approach where all 12 songs on a CD have 1 word titles.I've never listened to Fallout Boy so I don't know if they sound like them or not. I really like some of the melodies. The songs have a punk sensibility with an 80s feel. It's an eclectic style but it leaves them with nowhere to go. The biggest problem is that by the end, the whole CD starts to sound the same. My favorites would be ""The Only Difference . . ."", ""London Beckoned . . ."", ""Lying is the most Fun . . ."" and ""I Write Sins . . .""."
3,Did I slip and accidentally buy Fall Out Boy?,"I read a little piece in Rolling Stone that said that a member of Fall Out Boy had stumbled across these kids on their website. After hearing their stuff they got signed. I don't understand how he wasn't offended as this is a blatent robbery of their sound! Now, don't get me wrong, I am not offended by the sound of FOB, in fact I quite like them but I can't understand how they can't hear Panic! At the Disco and not think ""Is this us? Did we get drunk and forget that we recorded a new album and gave it to some young'uns from Las Vegas?""Panic! At the Disco is good - I do like it BUT after buying the CD based on the hype I feel a bit disappointed. I was hoping for something more original not a rip off of FOB. I swear it could be the same people! If you like FOB then this is for you. If you are looking for something a bit more original and outstanding, buy the Arctic Monkeys. A band that know how to be a one off."
2,"yeah, this is pretty crappy","pop fodder for people that like silly teen music. This is what people that were listening to britney spears and n-sync are listening to now. Where's the substance? Well, there is room for every type of music and there is a need for teeny music so they are filling that hole it's just not what I like."
1,WTF?,Who listens to this??.. either your on anti-depressants or you just have a bad taste in music...
1,kids should be ashamed to listen to this fake girly pop rock,"i agree the with the reviewer below me that we should just stop watching trl and let it die out so better music can come along and i think think this review sums up fake rock bands like Panic! At the Discotale this junk off of the punk listings-ether your punk or your pop-give punk rock the respect it deservesFebruary 19, 2006Reviewer: M. saylor ""hlsaylor"" - See all my reviewswhy is this junk even listed under punk? anyone who knows what real punk sounds like knows that this isnt real punk, its just boybands who want to seem tough and/or deep. if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- and if you cant handle that then please stop calling yourself punk ok?"
2,ehh,"Each song sounds practically the same. The titles are so long my itunes doesn't have enough spaces to fit the title. The titles don't even make sense with the lyrics. The lyrics do NOT flow at all. Its just the same up beat. They attempt at flowing bigger words with their melodies...and they just fail miserably. Being a musician myself, i find this band lacking musical and lyrical talent."
2,A fever I want to sweat out.,"ohh myyy godd. now all mighty P!ATD followers. dont hate me for saying this, but this sounds all the same. the only difference is the synthesiser. i give ryan ross credit for the lyrics (wich are very provocative) and i give brendon M'd parents credit for making him so fine. the voice is good but it all has the same tone."
5,They are not a Fall Out Boy wannbes...,"This CD has been reviewed as sounding like Fall Out Boy. You do not need to hate/love them for sounding like Fall Out Boy because they don't sound like them. Just like every band out there, Panic! At the Disco has influences and Fall Out Boy is one of them especially since the producer and the record label are the same. If you listen to the sound, there is always a techno background and big beat, just as the band states that they sound like. Another thing is that instruments such the piano are used which makes it even harder to categorize them and compare them to any mainstream band out there. The lead singer sounds like Patrick Stump at times, especially in ""The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage"" and that is why people may get a little confused. For a first album, it sounds musically mature and the lyrics are very clever. This is definitely a great CD to buy and even though I'm a dirt poor college kid, it was worth my money."
5,Good Sound,Panic! at the disco is a fresh sound that is very addicting. It has rock rhythm which is easy to listen to. There music is addicting as much as the lyrics. This band reminds me of Fall Out Boy with a more rock edge with a techno beat. The music is well done and the cd is awesome.
3,fall out boy jr.,"it's actually not a bad record, but boy does this band sound like they want to be fall out boy. it's so blatantly obvious that it's impossible to overlook. this record is very well-written and catchy, and it sounds good. however if you don't like fall out boy i can't even begin to understand how you could like this record. it really goes both ways. however, lots of bands totally rip-off lots of bands to don't judge this record based totally on that. if you're into today's pop-punk there's probably a few songs that you'd find enjoyable. if you don't like fall out boy, however, i'd say don't even bother.another thing, how exactly are these guys a ""dance"" band in any sense?"
2,Meh..,"Like the techno beats you kiddies? Think your punk, emo, indie inspired? Try this band: Reggie and the Full Effect. Sounds a bit like this but a tad more entertaining. NOT even comparing the two, just the beats and thought process for songs.. this could have been a good band if they hadnt jumped the shark..."
1,"Awful, awful band","These kids have somehow taken everything good about danceable rock music and made me hate it. Sure, some of their songs are catchy, but the only thing seperating them from every other run of the mill ""emo"" band is their rhythm section. The lyrics are awful, the synth is just plain annoying, the guitars are simple punk-pop fare, and they're so obviously latching on to the dance-punk craze it's not even funny. If your favorite bands are Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, by all means, buy this album. But if you want your bands to have a little more substance than style, skip it."
1,this band is as punk rock as a pink dress stay away at all costs!,"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
1,Do not bother with this album.,"This album is terrible. Reading the lyrics sounds like some angry kid scribbling bad poetry into his journal. If you're into that sort of thing, I'm not knocking it (I was a angry teen once and scibbled bad poetry. Still write bad poetry. Still angry, just older). As for putting this junk to music? NO. I can't believe this is popular."
1,Thank you for making marketing work.,"1. Panic! At the Disco sounds like Fallout Boy because they used to cover their songs.2.If you listen to this, you've been completely played. The entire album is tailor-made to appeal to young, teenage girls. Every song has a dance-based beat, incessantly suggestive lyrics and titles that almost make the song's content seem socially relevant to all the little suburbanites. Please, stop polluting the air with this re-hashed, re-worked junk."
4,One of my favorite CD's!!,There was only one song that I didn't care to hear more than once. If you like up tempo rock then you will definitely love this CD.
4,go get it. NOW.,i first heard P!ATD at purevolume two months ago. one song alone made me realise i need to hear much more. i bought it a month ago. and ever since i need at least one spin a day to feel better. dont trust me. just listen to the samples and buy the album.
5,Pop-Dance Kind of bad :),"I really do like this album, my two favorite are; 'The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage' and 'I write sins not tragedies'. I haven't listened to any other album but I do suggest this one :) go listen to the whole songs on YouTube if you're not sure about it yet."
1,More Emo Trash,"More Fall Out Boy? One band that sounds like this is bad enough, who honestly thought a second would make it better.The lyrics are typical emo lyrics, not especially well written and charged with emotion bent on making other people angsty and hating their lives."
3,Everyone Needs to Calm Down,"Here's the thing, some of you seem very confused. This is not punk rock, so you punks can just stop being so upset about it because it's not poisoning your precious punk. It may be emo, but at this point, emo is so sub-genre'd that I would stop using the term because it's become meaningless. And the definition of poser would be someone who says they are hard (i.e. saying you like the sex pistols, who btw were a corporate construction like a boy band) but in reality don't like punk or rap or whatever the case may be, and tend to attack other people's hardness. Everyone on here getting their panties in a bunch is more likely to be a poser than the teenyboppers listening to this harmless dance rock. I am now checking the ""I am over the age of 13"" box; I suggest you all try it."
5,AMAZING & TOO GOOD FOR WORDS!!!!!,Panic! At The Disco are freaking chill (...) i freaking fell in love with them the first time i heard just one of their songs. they have amazing talent for only being 18/19. they also have a realy different but awesome way of writing their music. just about every song has a catchy tune that you won't be able to get out of your head for days so check them out cause i know you'll love em!!!!!!!!!
5,Brilliant,Excellent album.Very unique touch to all the tracks.Somewhat reminded me of the killers when i first listened to it but they r very different.Ive listened to this album over and over and the lyrics never get tired and neither does the music
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,P!ATD is amazing!!! Get this album now!!!! Every song is catchy and is tons of fun to sing along too. This is easily my favourite album right now... Also Motion City Soundtrack rules the world!!!!
2,Not Such A Sin,"There's a certain bourgeois charm these teenagers adhere to, as if they know the world is their oyster if they play coy enough - but they really don't care. Skip the absurd song titles [come on, `Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off'? `There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet'?] and you'll find a silly concoction of wannabe PopPunk poetry smothered in Emo-excess from high school graduates who rented `A Clockwork Orange' one too many times. Perhaps, this caught me on a good day, but it's not as insulting as it could have been and a lot more fun than the new one from that other Las Vegas `Vegas' act, The Killers. My grade: B-"
2,pshh,its hard to find a more cliche poppy rock band out there right now. Oh yeah i forgot this one has a synth in it.... and it still sucks.
1,Watch your mouth boys,"Their first single ""I write..."" is horrible. Who ever thought it was ok to put a word that has to be bleeped in the main chorus. That's the stupidest thing ever. Aiming music at kids that's not fit for them. Instead of closing the $%% #@#$ door they need to shut their #$%^#%^ mouths! Go buy a Simple Plan CD or a One Tree Hill soundtrack."
1,MORE emo??,Another band with the exact same sound as every other emo band to come out of the same exact place... America. Are Americans really that depressed?WHEN will it all end??!!
1,same singer,"I swear every generic emo band like Fallout Boy, Taking Back Sunday, and the mighty awful Panic At The Disco must have the same singer cause If you hear them its the same voice. Now that I let that out of my chest this is by far one of the worst bands I had the displeasure of ever hearing, nothing about it is original, sadly enough when I was still in high school I was subjected to hearing this crap non-stop that I wished I pulled a Van Gogh on myself, this band has no redeeming value whatsoever, they are just a another generic band that copied an equally bad band called Fall-Out Boy who let's face it, only caters to adolescent girls, thank god this band ain't relevant anymore, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE, reading a book on car seat belts is more entertaining, looking at cement dry is more exciting, hell even watching grass grow is awe gasping than listening to this generic emo crap."
5,Disco's NOT DEAD!!,"I will listen to this band until the day I die! Everytime someone tells me rock or punk is dead, a band like Panic at the Disco comes out and proves them all WRONG! And it's more than just punk, it's real FEELING. you can hear it on their voices and I can tell they have gone through the same bad times as me. And that's all that matters, I want to like bands that are like me!My dad keeps teeling me that the Beatle have better ""hooks"" but those old hooks don't work anymore and they sound all muffled and old. I wake up everyday and listen to this CD and I got all straight A's (well almost-LOL!) this year so these hooks WORK!"
5,great cd,"I really do enjoy this cd. I had it playing in my car for a couple of days (and for me thats just strange) I like the intermission too. from start to finish, i like the overall composition song to song. the band and studio did a good job with this debut. good luck with the sophmore album!"
5,NOTHING OUT THERE LIKE IT,These boys are amazing. Listen to it once...then put it back on and listen to it all the way through again. The lyrics are not dumbed down and if you can handle it you will love it.Amazing!! Way to go boys. This album is profound.
4,Give them a break,"Okay, I havent actually got the album for this of my own, but I listen to my friends a lot. I think the msuic is so catchy, and i really like how they blend differnt types of music in (esp on the 'Im a diva' line from 'Theres a reason etc')The main reason I'm writing this review is to ask all the people that say the singer of patd sounds JUST LIKE the lead of fob, why that matters? Poeple have similar voices sometimes. Unless patd were actually having fobs singer when recording, I dont see what the problem is. This is a great band, and dont be put off by their comparisons to fob. their lyrics anmd sounds are fairly differnt, and the similarity of voices dont matter at all. Realy."
2,Don't believe the hype. There is nothing extraordinary here.,There is nothing extraordinary nor remarkable here. This album's got a lot of merchandising as different or cool. There is nothing ground breaking not special. Just a so-so like everybody else music. This album has got undeserved hype. And what's with those long song titles? How good can it be if the music is just plain and simple. What a dissapointment.
4,"not fob, but not bad","this cd is amazing. for only being in their teens still, you can truly see they will be around for a while. Their sound is poppy, but not kiddy pop. They have their own favor..."
2,Completely Underwhelming,"In search of some new music to listen to, I borrowed a couple of CD's from a Co-worker. One of the CD's I grabbed was ""A Fever You Can't Sweat Out"". I'd heard some good things about Panic! At The Disco and I was completely ready to like this album; until I listened to it. What I heard didn't impress me. These guys are basically a pop-punk/emo fusion with a dance beat. Someone else who posted a review here mentioned their use of instruments that don't appear in the genre often, and that is true... but I somehow suspect that has more to do with the producer than the band. The last song on the album was the most interesting one, but it almost reminded me of ""Mr. Bungle""-lite; genre changing just for the sake of it. From the looks of the comments here I'm pretty well outside the target demographic for this album, so that might explain my dislike of it. That said I can think of a few hundred albums I would recommend before this one."
4,Very Good CD,"I personally love this CD. It is a mix of rock and tech in a sense, and is different from other things that I've heard. My favorite songs from it were ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage"", ""Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks"", ""Time to Dance"", ""Camisado"", and ""There's a Good REason Why These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of it Yet"".My only other comment is that some of the lyrics are a little mature."
5,Unique,"I am not a fan of the 'new' punk. Bands like (no offense to these specific bands) Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Yellowcard all sound exactly the same to me. Panic! however seems very unique and refreshing. They definetly put the punk back in punk, even if they aren't old school."
1,Music that makes my mouth drop (in the bad way),"I am really in favor of experimental vocals, new instruments, and timing change-ups... but there are those who accomplish such variations gracefully and innovatively, and then there's Panic!. I have never heard someone with such a whiny voice cram so many non-rhythmic syllables into one ""sentence"". It's really a strain on my aural senses. Maybe the beats are catchy... and maybe there is some decent instrumentation - but holy jesus does that voice make me want kick my radio in while driving. This stuff is really meant for kids 13 and below, so I don't expect too much. But when you have two friends in their mid-20's giving this album some credit, I had to check it out. The Cringe-factor is hovering somewhere about 9.5 out of 10 (with Fergie holding it down at a flat 10)"
3,Talent? Please...,"I heard about panic playing at a club near me and i heard the show sold out in 5 days...Suddenly i realized there must be something irresistable about this band. With a name like Panic! At the disco, the band mates have got to be retarded. However, with such a terrible name they compensate with their sound. These are one of those bands, like good charlotte, like Fall out boy, like taking back sunday, like so many other before, who have fallen prone to the ""assistance"" of a studio engineer. In short, i want to say that they didn't harmonize, the guy making the dollar did. The producer made their sound before they probably knew what their own sound was. So, with such catchy rythyms and a very very annoying voice that you could hardly say is singing, i give props to the executive producer right now, because nobody is smiling more than him. If you want something to dance to, sure, buy this. Otherwise listen to some band with talent, like the beatles or something."
2,2 Stars For Trying...Minus 3 For Failing Miserably,"Hey LOOK! It's that old Fall Out Boy CD I've been looking for!Seriously people, it's nice for you to notice FOB's success and admire their style, but goddamn use a little creativity once in awhile, eh? I'm sorry, but not even those annoyingly long, random, ""clever"" song titles you think up will move me to appreciate this crud.""Dissing on Amazon is the most fun a REAL music lover can have without being shot down by an army of obsessed emo kids"""
2,not much talent here,"As far as originality goes, this album is 1 star. I decided to listen to these guys when i came home from college because my little sister loved them. Honestly, i cannot understand why, i guess its because the album was written and produced with all the shiny cheesy hooks and lyrics it takes to make it to the radio these days. If you like this genere of music, try Head Automatica. After hearing them, patd will sound like the pure crap it is."
1,Absolute tripe!,"OMG!I wouldn't even give this album a one!I can't believe that people are actually hailing this band as doing something new...the shear stupidity of claiming such a thing makes me fear for humanity!These sound even worse than most of the pathetic emo bands out there!I wouldn't dare call this music ""dance/rock"", it's just souless, kiddy pop.And if you want truly new and experimental dance/rock...then i'd stick with Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Arcade Fire, Franz Ferdinand type bands who could wipe the floor several times with this band.Leave it to these bands who truly know how to create a fresh sound with exciting beats and catchy lyrics."
1,Major Deception,"First off, to anyone who thinks that this band sounds like the Killers, or dance-synth-pop in general, BE WARNED. They are emo in disguise. I did not hear one second of a dance beat, it was mostly whiny and heavy, not upbeat and fun like the Killers or anyone similar to them.Watch out, because even their looks are deceiving. They are wearing suits and vests like the Killers and Louis XIV, but they do not sound anything like them. If you don't believe me go listen to them at PureVolume, they are emo."
1,"""FALL OUT BOY"" WANNABE!","number 1. horrible singer, the lead singer guy sounds like he's fall out boy's lead singers' brother.number 2. all songs don't really make me unborednumber 3. if anyone likes this band, they're to emo."
3,A pretty good album,"This is a pretty good album... i would say P!atd is fall out boy meets hellogoodbye. The songs are really catchy and memorable, espicialy ""camisado"", ""the only difference..."" "" lying is the most fun..."" and ""london beckoned..""Some of the songs are really annoying though and they get on your nerves... i would say like 2 or 3 of the songs are really crappy. Overall i would reccomend this cd to pop punk emo fans.Doesnt anyone else find it lame when people compare bands like fall out boy and p!atd and say they arent as good as like nirvana and jimi hendrix....duh.. how is that a fair comparison at all. Anyone can hide behind music legends and be untouchable, but it takes some guts to be a fan of bands that the classic rock nerds will knock on for ""not being as good as the beatles"" or some crap like that....big surprise."
3,Cool concept but you get shafted,"This is actually a nice tablet. The build quality is good and the features are impressive, but after using it I realized my much older notebook performs better.I got this to be a car pc, after shopping around I decided the HP was the best tablet to get. The touch screen is good and allows for finger manipulation. But the processor sucks, the battery life stinks, and multitasking is so so. Trying to justify the cost when I already have a 2.5 year old 14"" notebook the out performs it is hard.So if you need a tablet, and don't have a computer of any kind then sure buy it, other than that it's a waste of money. HP should have used a better processor and chipset. It would have made this a must have."
1,Avoid these at all cost,"I will have to mirror the comments of other people here and on other sites: The motherboards on these are inferior, last 12 to 14 months, and HP will not stand behind their mistakes. You will eat it. After a year you will be left with a quite expensive paperweight. Unless, of course, you pay 600 bucks to have it repaired, only to fail in another year. HP has lost a lot of customers over this piece of junk. BTW, I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but that doesn't matter. The retailers are not at fault. It's HP."
2,Freemantle's latest opus is dull and unbelievable.,"The first 80 pages have 4 pages of dialogue, no action and introspection ad nauseum. Indeed, all the ingredients are there, but instead of baking a satisfying cake with them, Mister Freemantle has spilled them onto the counter and leaves his reader to clean them up. This would seem to be a clear case of an excellent thriller author attempting to write ""lit-tra-thurr."""
3,Is anyone else having sound quality issues?,"This was a gift from my husband, and on some episodes the laugh track is far far louder than the dialogue. It is very random. I know we had a speaker setup issues, but we corrected that and we still have this problem (even when we play it on the computer).I do love Friends and the set itself is very nice, I am just concerned about the sound quality.I will point out that I have been watching the re-runs for quite some time on numerous networks and cable and there are episodes that are rarely, if ever, shown in syndication. Such as the one in the laundromat with Ross and Rachael or where Nana dies (and people think Chandler's gay). I see the pilot often, but not these older episodes very often. It is nice to have the set."
2,dvd,Great idea to make a box set of Friends. The quality is not good. The DVD's do not play in some of our DVD players.
1,waste of time,"""Friends"" was never a good show and not one of the ten seasons has made me laugh once. You would be wasting your money buying this set for $200+. Skip it."
5,THE GREATEST SHOW EVER!!,"I have been watching this show since I was like 10. I grew up with it. I've seen each episode at least 15 times. These seasons are a must have. They are what made the 90's. I don't know one person that did not truly love the show. I converted all my relatives into loving it, and a few friends of my own. A dvd collection should not be without this one. I still find each episode just as funny as the first time I saw it. You can never get sick of them. You won't regret owning these. You'll always having something to make you laugh and cheer you up when you need it most, especially when your own friends aren't around. You'll always have FRIENDS as you friends!!"
4,delayed shipping.,"I love friends and am glad that there originally was a discounted price on this item, but I ordered it on November 15, 2005 and it has been delayed several times. It is now January 24th and the latest delay of many pushes it to an expected shipping date of Feb 10. Has anyone else received this item?"
5,Perfect Xmas gift to myself!,I started a VCD collection slowly and am selling that now cause I got this and it's the best!!!I am so glad I waited for this complete collection before I bought any DVD box sets. The casing makes it look so impressive. It's the only thing displayed on top of my TV cabinet because it's meant to be displayed!Buy one now!!!
4,What about the final episode?,The limited edition Friends-The Series Finale DVD claimed to be the only place to get the broadcast version of the final episode. Will it appear differently on this dvd?
1,Now I'm totally pissed off!!!!!!!,"Even though I share feelings with you guys considering ""Friends"" the best show of all time, why the f*ck is Warner releasing a special commemorative box with all 10 seasons at such a low price as $20 a season while all of us fans (wich probably have already bought all nine seasons!) have been paying so much more money for these dvd's!! And what have we got for free?? Absolutely nothing!!I don't mean to be a freak but I believe I'm right about this and you may feel the same too. I wish I hadn't bought all of the previous seasons and spent so much more money than this package costs and I would've got this cool box."
4,Friends DVD all 10 seasons,"The DVD's are terrific as expected. I had never watched Friends in its primetime so I love having the entire set to watch in order from start to finish! The box is nice but NOT super good quality. It seams like heavy duty black cardboard, which came with a few scratches on it already. The plastic cover seems like it would be easy to break. If you're careful in its handling you should be ok, but I wouldnt pay extra for the box."
2,"People, Let it go","For the people that are complaining that its not fair for WB to produce this box set of all 10 seasons at a reduced price. I'm sorry but how did you not see this happen. I purposefully didn't the seasons individually so that i could buy the box set when it inevitably came out. On the other hand, they really should have done some kind of deal where for ever season you send them back, they get like 10$ off the price of this box set, that would have been fair, but we live in a capitalistic society so, get over it"
1,This is not fair...,"dont get me wrong, FRIENDS is the best sitcom ever!!but the release with this BOxed sets is NOT fair for millions of people who waited and buy each season released for the past 9 seasons..now they have to spent another 210 to get this boxed set (i mean look at the box its self,, its gorgeous)people who bought the 9 seasons from the start definetely will feels my feeling..we are even spending about $30 each season.. whereas this cool packet box cost $21 per season..at least give the loyal FRIENDS fans who had been buying the last 9 seasons a paid off...come on WB ?"
5,Love Friends,I gave it as a Christmas present to young 19 year old lady. She couldn't keep smiling when she opened her gift. It was wonderful to see that.
5,Worth every penny,"If you are like me and waited til there was a boxset available, then this is perfect!! I love the box, and the fact that they all came together. To me, it was worth every penny!!"
4,The best,"I cant wait to get this collection. For me too Friends is the best comedy show ever. Who cant forget those humorous moments on our friends's lifes: Chandler in a box, Monica dancing on top of a vacuum cleaner, Ross get stuck on his leather pants, Joey not having a commited relationship, Phoebe marrying Mike even though she was freezing, or thinking her aunt was stuck in a cat. Yep I will treasure those moments forever. The cast of Friends lives on my heart forever. They help us all thru tough moments."
5,Now ESPN needs is a Video to go with this!,"Over the past several months their has been an abundance of books about the sports century, ranking people and each list is very subjective. ESPN has put together some of the more interesting highlights of the last century and this book is one of a kind.In just over 280 pages there is more sports memories than just about any other book I have read. Packed with photos, and some of them rare, laced with stories and filled with memories, there is something in this book for every sports fan, both young and old.ESPN has made a name in the sports world as the leader in sports coverage, not with this book they proved themselves right. You'll read about Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Joe Dimaggio and Ted Williams, Johnny Unitas, Pete Rose, Ali and Jordan.For the true sports fans this book makes the perfect addition to the library. About the only thing book needs now is a video to compliment the writing. Excellent work and congratulations ESPN on a job well done."
5,A great gift for a sports fanatic,"I bought this book for a gift - but caught myself reading it before I wrapped it - so I bought one for me, too. A great look at sports through the 20th century. Any sports fan would enjoy this book."
1,obvious and biased.,"just look at the cover. she's the hurt victim, he's the uncaring jerk. this booktakes that tack throughout. the author pays lip service to the idea that both partners need to make the 'right decision', but in reality, this book is all about how to get him to agree to have a child.look at the marketing of the title itself; if this book were truly neutral, it would be called ""she wants a baby, he doesn't"".this book is marketed to women with a specific goal in mind."
2,I don't know what it is,"It might be the annoying characters, maybe it's the amatuerish acting, the paranoia of the previous generation might be the attraction or it might be the fact one of the characters in the film actually assualts a truck filled with chickens but I can't not watch this film.I just wouldn't pay a lot to watch this film."
2,Unprofessional Video,"This video is overpriced and is a ""home"" video style presentation. Can't believe this production company was hired to cover this special event. Not even close to the actual experience. Missing a lot of coverage. The tapes came in a cheap video cover with stickers on the actual video tape of the production company ""Clearwater"". The first time I viewed the tape, the company sticker came off as I popped it out of the video player. (Can you get any cheaper than that?)"
4,"Gorgeous, but.....","Exactly who is this Colonel Covington?As a decade-long resident of Colorado and reenactor, I can't believe such a beautiful book as this would seemingly slip as to give a name to a person who never existed.I am familiar with Col. John M. Chivington, the Butcher of Sand Creek, and his bloody troop. It is hard to NOT know of this fiend who used his faith to justify outright slaughter. Wars need to be fought among soldiers, not towards innocents. Ah, but I digress.I would have much wished that the folks at Time Inc. had caught this typo before these books were sent to press. It would have made all the difference to preserve the integrity of this book.At least from a historical perspective.My view is petty in light of this book's appeal. Forgive my mentioning the point but it is the only thing that marred my looking through it and savoring its images and glimpse into the film."
5,Easy to Follow Book. Five Stars,I have been using SW for approximately five months. I was an old Pro/E user. I purchased this book last month and I AM GLAD THAT I DID! The book is very well written and I agree with the other reviewers in that the book provides an easy to follow step by step procedure. SW is a great software tool. The author works with toolbars and right-click commands. The screen shots in the book are clear and accurate. I was able to simply follow the steps with their bold commands and watched the enclosed CD for the proper procedure. It was simple and straight forward. What a concept! Very good book.
2,DIDNT MEET MY NEEDS,"First, about me. New to solidworks, not new to CAD. Bought the book knowing the basics but needing to learn more about Assemblies. My prefered way of learning software is to start with a project that is of interest to me (work or personal). When I get stuck, I like to go to a reference and read about a topic and then hopefully see an example. Then I apply what was shown to my project.This book is very awkward for trying to learn this way mainly because the examples are way too complicated for demonstrating simple operations. I really think to get the most from this book you need to start at the beginning and work your way through - like you would do in a classroom setting - I'm guessing this is what the book might be written for and it might me a fine book in that setting.My interest was to use the book as a reference to quickly learn solutions to specific problems I encounter while working on my own projects. For this purpose, the book did not meet my needs"
1,WHAT A DEAL! ITS A FRAUD!,"I thought that it was very odd that a TAG Heuer Carrera Watch would cost only $149, even though it was used. I ordered the watch and then received an email from the seller asking if I read the ad description. Well the product description described the watch but as I looked further, I found that the seller is not selling the watch but is deceptively selling just the band. After I canceled the order I received an email from the seller telling me that I should have known it was too good to be true and that I would be hard pressed to find a watch under $2000. I just hope that the seller is not allowed to deceive other potential Amazon customers from what is normally a pretty reliable process. For someone that is serving their country in Afghanistan I do rely on the goodness of truth in advertising on Amazon. My money is earned at risk to my life."
3,Needs More Maps,I enjoyed reading this book but it was sometimes hard to figure out what happenned in each of the battles since there was typically only one map for each battle. In fact the map for gettysburg did not even show where any of the troops were at any time during the battle.If you want to read this book I would recommend having maps of the battlefields that you could refer to. This would help you figure out what is going on better.
2,Hagiography at its worst,"I got through the first three volumes but it was hard to take. Freeman is not at all objective. According to Freeman, the South lost, rather than the Union won. When Lee lost it was not because the Union defeated him but because Lee had a bad day, his lieutenants blundered. While Lee won many battles because of the incompetence of his Union opponents, Freeman fails to recognize the bravery of Union soldiers. Grant gets denigrated at the expense of Lee. Sheridan and Sherman are dismissed and Meade gets lost in the battle of Gettysburg; he didn't win; Lee lost because of Stuart's disappearance, problems with Longstreet, etc. This gets quite tiresome. No doubt Lee was a great general; he was not God and he was bested by Grant.Freeman fails to give credit where due. After three volumes, I gave it up."
4,I really like it,I of course researched and researched car seats and found this one would be the best for my family. At first it seemed to a more of a pain than necessary because tightning the straps was impossible. But the more you get used to it - the easier it is. I do not recommend this seat if you have to exchange it every morning into a different car because it is really heavy. But we just went on a 12 hour car trip and my son was very comfortable.
5,Nicole,"My husband and I bought one seat for each car. Our daughter loves this seat! It's nicely padded, the harness straps never twist or tangle, and the seat curves around our baby. Another great feature is that you can adjust the harness straps and change height position without having to remove the seat from the car. This seat is more cost-effective than Britax. It looks about the same and has similar features. It also received high praise from Consumer Reports. We are very pleased with this purchase."
3,Question?,Does anyone know if this car seat is also rear-facing? My 4 mo old (20lbs) has outgrown her infant seat but it still too young for a forward facing seat. Thanks!
2,Updated review: LOVE the seat after a little struggle,"As always, A++ service from Amazon.comOK ... I think Evenflo does a miserable job in their manual explaining how to tighten and losen the straps. I finally had an ""Uh DUH!"" moment and discovered that the straps pull up from the BOTTOM of the seat. All along I had been tugging them to come loose from the shoulders (like the Graco infant seat). I re-read the manual, but it's just poorly written.All in all, I do LOVE the seat and so does my son. It fits well in my 2003 Ford Explorer with one exception - the latch strap sort of blocks the knob/lever on one side.Otherwise, I'd recommend."
4,good car seat,The only thing I found not so perfect about this car seat is that the loosen straps lever requires very stong fingers to operate & that it doesnt recline as much as infant carriers causing my babies head to fall forward when he sleeps.
5,Awesome Seat!,"We bought this seat when my 4 month old outgrew her Graco snugride. We looked at several carseats and spent hours researching all the different carseats. We actually went to the store to buy a different seat, but saw this one and decided to get it. My daughter hated her Graco seat and would cry everytime we were in the car. We bought this one and she loves it. We took an 18 hour car ride and only had to stop for a total of 45 minutes for her. She slept and played in it the whole time. I would definitely recommend this as a transition between infant carrier and booster. I wouldn't recommend this for newborns, and only because of convience sake. It would be hard to move an infant in and out of the car by having to unstrap them every time instead of carrying the infant carrier around. If you are looking for a new carseat, definitely invest in this one. It is the sofest and most comfortable one we found!"
5,This is an idiot proof seat!,"I spent the first 8 months of my daughters life researching her ""big girl"" car seat and narrowed down my choices to two seats. While the Britix seats are nice they were simply not in the budget since both my husband and I pick her up at daycare we needed two.The seat is easy to install, I admit I am baby challenged and it took me ten minutes using LATCH. The harnesses were easy to figure out as everything is clearly labeled. The seat is plush and soft which my daughter loves.The seat fits great in my Hyundai Elantra, more room than the infant seat even though it is bigger.All in all it is a great seat, reclines nice, easy to install, easy to use, and comfy for baby."
2,So disappointed!,"Unfortunatley after hearing such wonderful things about this seat, I have to disagree! My husband and I truly came to hate it and ended up returning it for the Britax Marathon. The #1 reason we bought it was for safety and seeing that it was rated in the top 3, but was cheaper than many of the other top rated seats, we logically went for the Evenflo. However, the crank was always stuck and we had to squeeze our son's arms through the loops to get him out because it NEVER released properly! Also, his head always tilted down when he slept, not to mention how bulky & heavy it is.We like the Britax because of many reasons, so if you can, I would splurge for the Britax right off the bat! It's sooooooooooo much easier to use, plus the fabric is stain resistant and easily removable. The Evenflo fabric is nearly impossible to remove if you need to wash it. (Also, the Britax goes up to 65 lbs. so it will last longer for the additional money you spend!)"
3,wish it were more durable,"We got this bib as a gift 8 months ago and have used it religously. Unfortunately, a few months ago it sprung a hole in the center fold. It still works for catching solids, but everytime my 20-month old spills liquids down the bib, it goes right onto her clothes. We've started turning the bib around backwards to allow liqiuds to run off the bib onto her tray. We've really enjoyed the product, but wish it were more durable."
5,Great innovation!,This is the one and only bib I use almost 4-5 times a day...and it's so easy to clean and use. The soft material contours the baby's body perfectly and catches every drop and drip my baby throws. I love this bib !!! and so does my baby...!
4,Is not ideal if baby has neck rash,"It is a very nice product, soft and easy. But it was an ideal for my daughter's neck. She has neck rash and the plastic ring around the neck was not a good ideal for her."
4,Baby can take it off,"I needed a bib that would catch crumbs that were getting all over my baby's lap when she ate bread. This bib was perfect, and I love being able to wash it so easily. Unfortunately however, my 9 month old figured out how to pull it off within a week. She just pulls the bib until the plastic piece comes out. Such a bummer, as it pretty much renders it useless if I can't keep it on her."
3,Great idea but awkward to use with high chair,"This is a really great bib--easy to clean, perfect for wet foods like yogurt and applesauce, a large pocket, etc. The only problem is that it's quite awkward to use with a high chair. The bib is long enough that it interferes with the high chair tray. The bib sticks out (where the pocket is) since it's a hard material, so I can't push in my daughter's high chair tray very far. That makes it more difficult for her to reach food on her tray, and unfortunately more food ends up on her lap. If the high chair issue doesn't bother you, then this is a great bib. My daughter likes it and doesn't seem to be bothered by the rubber piece around the neck."
4,Doesn't fit in the high chair with our baby,"These bibs are heavy duty, easy to rinse off (probably their best trait), and have a substantial pocket to catch drips and crumbs. However, we never use them because I can't get this bib on our baby comfortably while she's sitting in her high chair. Because the rubber/plastic these are made of is so stiff, there's no way to tuck this in around her, and she's too short for it to dangle. So, while this will be great once she's in a booster seat, I recommend trying something more traditional for a baby in a high chair."
3,Left a red mark on my baby's neck,"I really liked this product so much because it served its purpose well, crumb, water and vomit catcher. But the sad thing is, everytime my baby uses this, it leaves a red mark on his neck like somebody tried to strangle him. Though it is not choking him at all. My husband asked me many times about the marks as well, it's pretty bad. Though the mark disappears by the end of the day, its still not acceptable. When I tried to loosen it to where the neck band won't touch his neck or skin, the bib is not going to be sitting right under his chin anymore, thus losing the purpose of using it as a crumb catcher. I think if there was a softer, more gentler neck strap, this would be perfect."
5,Best Bib,Never thought I would like a bib so much! This is the perfect size and looks soooo cute on. The little white beads around the neck look like a necklace.
2,Neck strap rubs,The neck strap on this piece of gear irritates and distracts the LO from eating. I would recommend sticking with a cloth bib of any type.
5,My life is now complete,"No more do I have to pick up random food artefacts from the crevices in our toddler's high chair. No more do I have to hunt for random food stains that have dribbled down to my toddler's clothes to prevent the 'mummy wrath' when somebody needs clean clothes for the fifteenth time in a day. No more do I have to go hunting for a clean bib - I can just hose this one down outside with our toddler and they both come up sparklingly clean!When our toddler drops food now, he just picks it out of the bib and eats it. With this fine bib and a toddler with the ability to feed himself, I can now sit back at meal times and write reviews on Amazon!"
5,Best Bib Ever!,"Got this bib for my 11 month old who is self-feeding. It is great for catching the food he drops (no more cleaning the high-chair after every meal). It is soft enough to be comfortable and rinses easily for the next meal. I no longer have a pile of cloth bibs to wash!! Yipee!! You can also get this bib at Babyage.com for $9.95 plus free shipping on your entire order. Get 2 -one for home, one for dining out!"
1,Hard Plastic Cut Baby's Neck,"I am so disappointed with this product. I purchased 4 of these bibs and I couldn't understand why, when I put this on my 4 month old baby he screamed so bad. I assumed it was the ""resistance"" other reviews discussed, to the hard plastic bib rather than the soft one. Later that night my husband was bathing him and noticed a wound on the back of his neck. The next day I put the bib on again and and he started to scream. After further evaluation I noticed that the point where the bib connects, was cutting into his skin exactly where the wound was. I immediately stopped using the product. It has been 3 months since discontinuing the use of the product and my baby STILL had a scar on the back of his neck from this bib. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!"
2,suitable for under 9 months,I purchased this item for my 16 month old but the bib is tiny and very short. the picture looks much bigger and dimensions are not shown. the description should make it clear that it is only suitable for 3-9 months.
2,Nice... but NOT soft,"We bought this because of all of the other positive reviews, it is washable, and it said it was soft. We tried it this morning, and he hated it. It is not soft, and pretty hard plastic. It did stay on when he tried to pull it off, but just made him too angry to eat! The cheap velcro bibs are more effective."
3,Stains easily and permanently,"After the first time I used this bib with Gerber vegatable beef 3rd foods, an orange stain stayed on the entire bib, even after being washed in the sink and then in the dishwasher. Because it does not fit closely to the neck, I need to use a second bib underneath to protect clothing. I do like how the tray at the bottom catches the food that misses my 10 month old's mouth. The stains do not affect the bib's usefulness, however I would not have purchased it if I had known it could not be cleaned."
3,Easy to clean and better than flimsy bibs,"This bib is a lot smaller than I thought it would be from reading the reviews. It is 10 times better than other bibs when it comes to cleaning it, but its not wide enough to catch food falling off the back of the spoon when my daughter scoops up too much. Also when she drips anything tomato based on it, it will stain instantly. There is room for improvement on this bib but if I could afford it I would buy 10 of them anyway due to how much better they are than the pocketed bibs I got from Target."
4,Durable but uncomfortable,When your child starts learning to feed themselves this bib is a must. It catches everything that falls and can be easily washed. My only complaint is that it is pretty rigid and my daughter hates wearing it. It's obviously uncomfortable and hard to fit in the highchair.

3,My baby did not like this.,"When we tried to buy this, it was because of washing the product. When I use the cloth bib, it was so tough every time we used it. That was why we bought this. But, decisively, my baby did not like this."
2,Too small for chubby babies,"My baby is only 5 months old but is quite chubby... This bib is already too small for his neck! I can force it on without strangling him, but it's clear that he hates it because it's not comfortable. I love the durability of the design, but I don't see how this bib could fit a baby for very long, especially not one with any chub."
2,"Just ""Okay""","My one-year-old prefers the Bumpkins bibs, which are softer. This bib is fairly stiff. She fusses with it-- it may be uncomfortable. Usually she pays little attention to her bibs, so I'm not sure I would recommend this one."
2,Not that excited about this product.,"I bought this bib strictly based on the other reviews I had read. For the most part people were raving about it and giving it 5 stars, so somehow I convinced myself that we should be giving it a try too. Now I've had it for a couple of months and have only used it once or twice. My baby doesn't think it is very comfortable to wear unfortunately, and just looking at it I'd have to agree. No, I'm not loving this bib like everyone else. Just go get something soft and thick that doesn't cost nearly as much. You'll be fine without this one."
1,Don't get it....,"I spent $30 buying these bibs for my triplets. What a waste! I thought they would be great from the reviews. They are now sitting and collecting dust. I started trying use them when the babies were around 10 months old. All three of them immediately ripped the bibs off and threw them in the floor, food flying everywhere. Am I doing something wrong? They also pull off cloth bibs but the ones that go over their heads seem to work pretty well....Any advice?"
2,do not like it,"after I clipped it once pinched my baby's neck with this ""pearls like "" clip, I never used it again!"
3,"Pocket is great, hate the neck-piece","This does what it supposed to in terms of collecting food, however, don't expect it to prevent stains on the collar of your little ones shirt. The clasp for the neck is stiff and uncomfortable and if you make it tight enough to cover clothes, it chokes you little one. We wear it loose and only use it for dry unmessy food."
5,This bib rocks,"This thing works exactly as advertised. You do have to make sure you lift your kid's chin and get this thing kind of snug--otherwise, it's too loose and gives little ones the opportunity to chew on it. If they can chew on it, it's too loose. When snug, it's perfect--not a drop on baby. It washes up easily right after by hand and I towel dry it (I don't think I would want to put this in the dishwasher or leave it dirty for a while). It cleans so easily by hand it only takes a few seconds anyway. Highly recommended!"
3,Great bib if your baby will leave it on,"We got this bib when my daughter was 10 months old because our JJ Cole ones would mildew if they were put back into the diaper bag with any moisture in the pocket. This bib is great because it wipes dry after handwashing and it's completely sanitary. The only downside is that it comes off very easily. For the first month, my baby would leave it on for a few minutes, then grab both sides of the pocket and easily yank it off. Now that she's a year old, she takes it off as soon as I put it on. The closure is very easy to pull off, unlike the snaps on our JJ Cole bibs, which she still can't figure out. I think the reason she doesn't like it is that the bib is rigid and wider than her chest, so it gets in her way when she feeds herself. Also, when she leans forward, the high chair tray pushes the bib up so it pokes into her neck. I'm hoping that she'll grow into it eventually, but for now I'm buying some new JJ Cole bibs."
3,I like it better than my baby does....,"This bib seems ideal: it catches food that would otherwise go on the floor, and is easy to clean up afterward. However, my son simply will not wear it. When he was quite young it was just way too big for him and made him cry whenever I put it on him. I kept trying, though, and eventually the crying gave way to him removing it himself. This might just be a peculiarity of my son, although he does tend to be pretty agreeable about trying new things generally. For what it's worth, I also loaned it to a friend of ours and her son had the same reaction (he was about 1 year old at the time)."
5,Babybjorn Soft Bib - green,Worked very well. Appreciate the catcher on the bottom. Easy to clean and adjust.I would recommend to all parents and grandparents.
3,Bulky and too easy to pull off.,"It is a little bulky and the front edge is right at the height of his high chair tray, making it hard to pull in the tray all the way. Also, my toddler pulls it off a bit too easily. It catches the food as intended when it's on though!"
1,Didn't fit my son's neck!,I purchased this bib after seeing my nephew with it. He wasn't able to put it into his mouth like soft bibs. However when I received it the bib wouldn't fit around my son's neck comfortably. The string of balls that's suppose to wrap around and clip into 1 side wasn't long enough. I don't understand how this is possible when my son is only 7 months and is lean and tall...not chubby. I wish they made this bib in different sizes since it's wonderful in theory but just didn't fit.
5,Awesome Bib!,This is the perfect bib for a toddler. It is very easy to latch an un-latch and covers most of their front so it significantly minimizes mess! Love it!
2,Not impressed,"2 problems with this bib. 1) It only covers a small area (even on a 12 month old). 2) The biggest problem - my daughters hair gets stuck around the ""pearl"" strand that clips into the holder piece to keep the bib on. She does not have a lot of hair. I bought 3 of these and will donate the 2 unused ones. I really prefer Bumpkin."
2,My children despise this bib,"I thought that as they grew longer in the torso, it might work better for them but both still refuse to wear it. The plastic closure is quite uncomfortable for them. I do like that it's easily washable and catches food so nicely but I had to give up on trying to use it for my two. In fact, I think I am officially inspired to freecycle their Bjorn bibs, considering how hated they are. Amazon reviewers generally steer me right but in this time for mine, it was a fail. Ah well!"
2,Trendy but not functional,"My daughter hates these bibs , they appear uncomfortable even at 17month. It hits the tray of her booster seat and pushes up against her neck. These are also by no means SOFT !!! They are hard, very hard and do not roll up which make them annoying to travel with. All is true about the easy clean, stain free, dishwasher safe, which is what I wanted but overall I wouldn't buy these again or recommend them to anyone. I have loved baby Bjorn products in these past but these don't cut it."
2,Better for older infants,My 9 month old is terrified of this. It is hard and stiff and when I try to put it on her she screams and tries to pull it off. I'm sure it would be very convenient during feeding times if I could just get it on her... lol.
4,Baby rice feeding ease.Satisfaction.,Baby rice feeding ease.Satisfaction.For the second child to buy.Yellow I want to buy anotherNeatly washed.I feel goodEnjoyable is the weaning time
3,"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Green",I purchased two color of them. and barely use it. I don't recommend it for the little babyes. it's good for toddlers. for babyes 0-10 month I don't recommend it. not convinient to use. it's not soft as they sayd. My daughter doesn't like it when I put it on her. she refused it to wear. Hope I will use it later.Otherways the product is not bad. But pricy.
5,Best Bib EVER!!!,"I've had these bibs for years and have used them since my oldest was 6 months. She is over 3yo now. The bibs are still completely functional and easy to clean. Two bibs + two kids + three years + still working like new = great investment! Definitely worth the cost!! Love them, buy them and you won't regret it!"
2,Liked the design concept,I liked the design concept of this bib and bought 3 of them but.... I have four grandchildren I have tried this on and not one of them will wear it! What a shame because it cleans up so great. The rigid design is too easy for them to lift up and protest until I take it off. We are better off with fabric bibs with sleeves which they think are just part of their clothing and they don't protest them anymore than they would a shirt. This bib is just too obvious to them and with 20 grandchildren I have found that not one of them appreciates a bib as much as I do! Great idea though.
1,My 7 month old can take it off!,"I was very excited about receiving this item. I love the color, the material and the easy it's to clean. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks using it, my 7 month old baby was able to pull it off easily and that was the end of it. I haven't been able to use it ever since. Also, one day I was feeding her carrots and the white part got stained even though I washed it right away. I'm back to the bibs with bottoms. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Best bib around,"This is the best bib I've found out there. So great at catching crumbs, and so easy to wipe clean. Only drawback is that because it's so firm, the bottom of the bib hits the top of the highchair tray and ends up being uncomfortable for baby. Great for toddlers on a booster, though!"
4,My Favorite Bib,"Love this bib. It catches EVERYTHING- solid or liquid or somewhere in between (baby can also reach into the lip and pull back out whatever just fell in if he or she so desires). Very easy to clean- rinse out, wipe out or toss in the dishwasher- no nooks or crannies to worry about. Not too wide in the shoulder area so it fits the smaller-than-average baby along with the larger-than-average baby. The adjustable neck closure is a wonderful and unique feature that I have not found in any other bib. Only suggestion for improvement (and only reason for not giving it 5 stars)- it could be just a little more flexible for easier transport in the diaper bag and for easier fit when using highchairs with higher trays- although both are still totally doable as is."
1,Terrible design,"This bib is not worth the money. My girls take it off immediately. It's very stiff around their necks and it doesn't fit with a high chair tray. I purchased it because of the great reviews, but I can't imagine how it works for so many people - we really dislike this. Glad I only purchased one."
5,Absolutely awesome! Best baby bib ever!,"This bib is the best! It saves me so much clean up time...no more mess all over my baby's lap and the highchair seat! Its so easy to clean, just quickly rinse with water or throw in the top dishwasher rack. I have two, one for the diaper bag, and one for home. It is soft and flexible, and the neck size if big enough once my baby becomes a toddler. Don't waste your money on those laminated bibs with the pocket at the bottom which doesn't even catch any of the food. I will be giving these as baby shower gifts! HIGHLY recommended!!"
2,"wouldn't purchase again, but holds food if spilled","baby hated it immediately, since its so stiff, but if he liked it I would have liked it since it does clean up well"
3,Bib,Loved the color but a bit small for a baby that is 12 months old. She's almost out of it. They say 4months old on this package but it might me too hard for them.
3,Good product but didn't work for us.,"I must say this is a well made product. Cleans well and well-designed. My LO never quite used and kept pulling the cord. So, I have stopped using it fearing that it might hurt. I would not buy it again. I tried the JJ cole soft ones and, they have been fine. My LO does not tug on them and they are easier to carry on day trips. The quality and design of JJ cole is much inferior to this product but they have worked better than these ."
2,I really wanted to like this bib,"I purchased 2 of these bibs and really wanted to like them, but ending up returning them and keeping the Bibbity bibs instead. The pocket on this bib is fantastic, and catches most of the dropped food. However, I ended up returning these bibs because as other reviewers stated, the neck is too rough. The material is a very hard plastic, which is fine for the bib, but not for the enclosure around the neck. My son didn't seem to mind this bib around his neck, but I chose the softer material of the Bibbity bib instead. This bib did stay in place around my son's neck, but when he pulled on the bib, I thought he was going to get a mark on his neck from the hard plastic. This is an ok bib that could be great if the neck enclosure was changed."
1,Baby won't wear,"I bought this for my 1 year old granddaughter, and my son said she won't wear it!! They said it was hard plastic! So, I bought three Bumpkins bibs, and she wears them everyday!! No problems. So, will stick with the Bumpkins."
1,"Made out of Plastic #7, the worst!","First, this bib is made out of one of the most dangerous plastics you can buy (#7). I didn't realize this until after I purchased it.My daughter couldn't stand this big because it always got stuck to her hair in the back where it snaps on. I would not recommend!"
3,Wouldn't wear it,I love the idea of this bib. Unfortunately my 12 month old refuses to wear it. He tries to yank it off and cries and then won't eat. Counterproductive. He has worn cloth or vinyl bibs from early on and had no issues. I don't know if this is too bulky with the high chair table or too distracting for him somehow but we're back to cloth/vinyl.
4,Great bib,"I have a 18-month old, and we have had this bib for 3 months now. I wish I had found it earlier!It is very easy to wash and goes into the dishwasher. The adjustable neck is very good.My only complaint is that I haven't found it in larger sizes."
5,Love the Baby Bjorn bib!,"This catches all; easy on, easy off; cleans up nicely; no waiting for bib to dry before next meal. This should last us longer than any of the other nasty pvc bibs we've had in the past."
3,Functional but not great,"I was hoping this bib would be of a softer and more flexible silicone. The rigidity of it makes it less comfortable for baby as it's not ""squishy."" I also don't really care for the hard plastic around the neck. That said, the shape and size is well done and the pocket catches the spills, so it does its job. It's just not the soft sort of silicone I was expecting."
2,Not for strong babies,"My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds. I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)"
2,So disappointed!,"I was really excited about this bib, but it has been a giant FAIL. First, my daughter, who is 18 months, can easily pull it off. The plastic strap that holds it on was secure at first, but became quickly misshapen and now is not secure at all. A gentle tug unfastens the bib. It stays on my daughter for about 30 seconds, at best. Second, the large cup-catch area at the bottom is so wide and inflexible that my daughter can't lean forward at the table. It's like she has a plastic wedge between her and the table. This infuriates her (understandably so) and then she just rips the bib off. What's good about the bib is that it's extremely easy to clean. If it stayed on, I suppose it would also catch a lot of food. But due to its design flaws, it's unusable."
3,"Great for catching crumbs and drips, but not very comfy for baby","I have mixed feelings about this bib. It is great for catching drips and crumbs, but it's not very comfortable for my baby. I have to put in on her really tight around the neck or she can drop her chin and actually suck on the top of it (that makes quite a mess underneath!). I like the idea of this bib, I just think it should be more made of more flexible material. It gets caught on the high chair tray too if I try to pull the tray up close to her. I would not buy another unless Bjorn made it with a flexible material."
3,It works.,"Could be a little softer, but it does catch food. Then our boy can lift it up and poor all the food that fell in it back on his face. Hooray!"
3,Tough Pelican,"Tough but stiff. I may have problem trying to roll this up to carry out. TommeeTippee is softer, able to roll but its concave pelican bib may collapse during use. have not purchase combi which have similar too."
2,good only as a toy kind of...,"it is very hard, you can't put this stuff around your baby's neck; my baby likes to chew on it but that's pretty much all its use; the colors are great; if it was maybe a much softer it will be so much useful."
3,Good overall but don't like the neck strap,I love Baby Bjorn products and I like this bib overall but I really don't like the way that the neck strap is designed. Prior models of their bib seemed easier to fasten and less of a chocking hazard. Fastening the white neck strap requires that the you press hard and fit it into a slot which feels like it's too tight around the baby's neck. I've resorted to using our old Baby Bjorn bib model instead.
5,All I hoped!,"I bought this for many reasons. I wanted a scoop like bib that was easy to clean and wouldn't come off too easy. Well, it's comfortable for my daughter, it is SO easy to clean and the shape and size is perfect. My daughter still can pull it off about as easily as she does velcro bibs, but she usually doesn't try to pull on it until she is done eating. It catches all the food! Her clothes get less stains with this bib! I love it. Worth every penny and I wish I would have purchased one sooner. And I love the color."
2,Too much footage cut out during editing.....,"Having been stationed onboard the ship during the deployment, I know that there is quite a bit of footage that was left on the editting room floor. Essentially all of the scenes relating to non-flight operations were cut so that only 'Flight Deck' operations remained. There is much more to an aircraft carrier than just pilots and the people wearing colored shirts, it's too bad no one ever gets to see or learn about them...the other two thousand people onboard are the ones that do the vast majority of the work that is necessary for the pilots and aircraft to get where they need to be."
1,Mediocre at Best,"So far I have only tried two recipes, but have been completely unimpressed. The two soups were very expensive to make, time consuming, and just not very good. The book claims that all the soups are full meals but this is far from true. I don't think the recipes are very creative. Bland soup occurs from the always similar onion, celery, stock base. Though the book's layout is good, it is overpriced and it's more worth your time going to the store to buy a gourmet soup."
3,Wish there were photos of actual soup,The photos of random people making goofy faces are kind of lame. I wish there were pics of the soup instead.
1,A total Ripoff,The review says 200 recipes. Someone help me. I barely counted 100 --- most of which I would not make in a million years.I am going to ask amazon.com to send me a mailing label to return this based on its misrepresentation.
5,Tasty and Creative,"The recipes in this collection are delicious -- full and hearty, with clear directions. The writing is simple and casual, and the love for soup comes through clearly. Highly recommended for cooks of all levels."
5,The Pea Parmesan alone is worth the price of the book,"This is a great book to take to the farmer's market with you. Come home with a basket of leeks, carrots, onions, and greens, and you've got the makings of a deeply satisfying meal. I make Pea Parmesan soup at least once a week--it's become one of my all-time favorites! I drove a pot of Pea Parmesan six hours up north to cure my boyfriend of a bad flu. It worked."
5,The only truly sane book on investing,"The problem with so, so many investment texts on the market is that the authors of the texts have a clear conflict of interest: read my book, buy my tapes and come to my seminar, and they'll teach you how to make a million dollars. A sucker is born every minute, and the dark scary world of investment books is proof of it.This is the best book on investing, and how to measure value generally, that I've ever read. It's very, very old school. If you feel yourself attracted to the NYSE like a big exciting roulette table, but you don't know what a P/E ratio is or what a stock split really means, buy this book before you do anything stupid."
5,If you can only buy one book on stocks buy this one.,"This book is an excellent primer on the stock market. If I could only have one book on investing in the stock market, this would be it."
2,14 years old,"Had I realized that this book was 14 years old I would not have purchased it. One of the bullet points on the front cover is ""Latest Statistics and Regulations"" which of course was the case back in 1994. I am sure some information may still be pertinent, but again there is no way to know what is and what isn't still valid. Personally I would not trust any investment advice that is almost 2 decades old, but then again what do I know, I'm the fool that bought this book in the first place."
1,TERRIBLE EXCUSE FOR A BOOK I'VE EVER SEEN,"This is absolutely the worst book I've have ever read. The ""book"" was more of an advertisement for the company's products than a self help book. Yes it does talk about fitness and nutrition. But here is how it addresses those topics: eat right, be fit. Well, I didn't spend my money to get just that sage advice. How about digging a little deeper? Talk more about how to get there instead of glossing over the topics. It is a good thing that this was on the internet because if you had an opportunity to thumb through its pages you would put it back on the shelf! If I were the authors I'd be ashamed of myself for selling you tripe like this."
1,lousy book - not worth a penny,Two thirds of the book is devoted to common sense - most of which you will already know.. the rest is devoted to persuading you to buy the authors make-up line for men. A waste of money and time.
1,Not helpful,"Unless you want to know how to wear makeup as a man, the book is of little use. Try GQ or Men's Health for more practical ideas."
2,"Love the History, Hate the size of type","I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this book because my family originated from Clonmel. I was very disappointed when it arrived since the type is impossible to read without a magnifying glass. The book is about 6""x8"", but the print only covers about 50% of the total page. Print needs to be about twice the size. I'll probably return it."
1,Type too small,"The type of this book is so small, it's impossible to read comfortably. The size of the book looks good, but opening the book up, the pages are printed very small on the page. It is being returned today."
3,I didn't care about these characters,"Little in this caught my attention, though it does evoke a place in the world I know nothing about. The character development is weak. We are never given a real reason to care about anyone in this film. The point seems to be something vaguely unclear about people who are separated by various things, some invisible, some emotional, some temporal. It's kind of high concept, really. But the plot is absent. The photography is good and so is the film technique."
3,not impressed,"I was kinda disappointed by this compared to other great Metropolis acts. No more SC for me. About the only track I like is #1, ""cause of death: suicide"", which is pretty aggro. The rest of the cd is semi-aggro.. certainly heavy & pounding but I don't know about ""danceable"" or creative."
4,A shining example of what industrial music really is,"Suicide Commando has been one of those bands that has put out a few good hits now and then...but failed put out an album that was truly great all the way through. Their last album, Mindstrip, was a bland affair in my opinion with the exception of songs Hellraiser and Love Breeds Suicide. Axis Of Evil, though, is a significant improvement over that album. The slow, banging, low bpm style that Suicide Commando is known for has been energized with a faster pace and more complex backround synths. Clever samples and sound effects have also been utilized to give the recording an ominous feel. The marching beat of Face Of Death and the sirens in the backround of Mordfabrik are almost hypnotic. The result is an overall more refined sound that makes the album enjoyable from start to finish. No future-pop or ebm here...just pure militant electro-industrial. Fans of the harsher side of industrial music should definitely add Axis Of Evil to their collection."
4,Good Stuff.,Suicide Commando gleefully wallows in a hostile dance groove while punctuating it with a synthetic attack matched by few. Axis of Evil is a hyperbolical agro-industrial-techno record that is sure to please all fans of the genre.By: C. Curry
5,Meowth Rocks,"This great toy is real huggable and every kid'll love it! This little guy'll always comfort you when you're upset. You'll always have fun with Plush Meowth! Throw him, hug him, and if you're getting this for a baby even bite him(trust me I've tried it)! Buying it here at Toys""R""Us is a great idea! He's worth much more than he costs! I think I can truly say that you'll never get to old for Meowth! This toy is not only for Pokemon lovers, it'll even suit Pokemon haters. If you don't like Meowth try Bulbasaur. He too will brighten up your day."
3,"Meowth, the bean bag toy","Personaly, I don't like Meowth or the toy. I like throwing it outside because it is very very durable. When it gets dirty, I wash it and it's good as new."
4,A very good introduction to Jazz.,"If you saw the Ken Burns series on Jazz and wanted to learn more, this book is a great place to start. While it does not pretend to be exhaustive, it covers the history of Jazz from the beginning to the present, without neglecting contemporary artists in the way that Burns' series did. The book also discusses musical issues in a way that the non-muscian can easily understand. This won't be the last book that you will want to read about Jazz, but it should be the first."
4,"Not a Page Turner, but a Good Overview","I'd actually give this 3 and a half stars, sort of a C+ in my opinion. Anyway- I've learned a lot from this book and use it more as a reference material than as a ""can't wait to read more"" type of thing. The author sometimes is a little circular in his opinions too- especially when he tries to define Jazz or a given era. Plus, with something like this, it almost screams for a companion sampler CD, or a publishers website or something. Many times he refers the reader to hard to find or out of print CDs/records (for instance making use of Smithsonian recordings which are not easy to get). On the other hand, I have made a good list of recordings and artists I haven't heard yet, and I feel like I listen with a much more educated ear now- even though I've been a big fan of Jazz for many years. So- it's recommended, but be prepared to do some home work along side the reading in order to actually hear what the book is discussing."
5,Jazz 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Jazz,"My husband is the biggest Jazz fan that I know of.This book was on his Christmas list, so it was a mustto buy it for him."
2,Dumbest idea ever?! Audiobook on jazz without music tracks,"I think people giving positive reviews of this are reviewing the book itself, not the audiobook (I have the audiobook on CDs). This is an audiobook version of someone reading the book Jazz 101 BUT THERE IS NO MUSIC INCLUDED. He references many artists and albums and even specific tracks and recommends that you go find the music as a supplement to what he is describing in the book. The book itself is wonderful and very succinct and easy-to-follow for a newcomer to jazz but I cannot get over the disappointment of having an audiobook about jazz that does not have any music on it. What are you supposed to do? Track down the music ahead of time and switch out the audiobook narration with music CDs? It would have been a brilliant product if they had added music tracks."
4,To the point!,"This is the best book I've found for those of us who have only a vague concept of what feng shui is, and how it is practiced. It covers the historical background and application to modern living perfectly - clear and concise. The analogies the writer uses are very helpful for us narrow-minded Westerners."
3,Small Book Size,"The content of this book is very informative; however, the size of the book is so small it is difficult to read. The pages have to be bent back to read the entire text. Because of its size it will be of limited use as a workbook. If you order this book, make sure that you are aware of its small size. Good illustrations and paper quality is also good."
5,A question for autors,"I read this book and I want to ask the autors a question about the Pah Kwa. I didn't find their email address, so I'll post it here. They said that the fame enrichment is always positioned over the font door. I got other information from other authors, and different Pah Kwa plans. I don't know which is right. I study architecture and I'm very intrested in Feng shui. I'll make a diploma degree out of Feng shui and I must make it right. Maybe I can get an email address of them here. Please contact me."
5,A novel with excellent writing and depth,"This is an excellently written novel. McCarthy not only can plot a riveting story, but he creates characters that are strikingly believable. Some of the more evil ones can scare from the page. Like McCarthy's ""The Road,"" many of these characters are loners who want to believe they are islands unto themselves, but find their lives intersecting with those of others. Many of the characters are unsavory, and with the possible exception of Sheriff Bell, I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time with them, but nonetheless you are interested in the outcome of their lives. McCarthy is not, however, who ties everything up with a bow, but also readers will be hard pressed to say they saw the various endings of those lives coming. This one may not be for everybody, but I find McCarthy to be one of the best authors of his day along with James Lee Burke."
2,Compelling but empty,"The book's style is compelling and readable, and it is easy to get through the economocial prose in a few days, but ultimately, the feeling I was left with was one of hollowness. this style--the pornographic descriptions of violence, the caricature descriptions of bad and immoral men--has been done before. James Elroy did it really well in White Jazz and LA Confidential, and the effect much more of a tour de force.Also, it seems strange that no one has picked up on the inconsistencies in the book. The sheriff fought in WWII? Moss fought in Vietnam but is currently 36 years-old? That would make sense if the book were set in the 1980s, but then the character Wells apparently carries a mobile phone. An elevator has computer-generated random codes to make it operate. In addition, Moss can't buy a gun because he lacks identification documents, but he is able to purchase a used truck. Hmmm. Some careful editing was needed here.In the end, diverting, but insubstantial."
4,Even better than the excellent movie,"This is one of those books where I saw the movie before having the chance to read the book. I really enjoyed the movie, but thought the book was even better. So much so, that I have watched the movie a few more times now with a more detailed understanding. I would recommend this without question."
4,Unfortunately saw the movie first...,"The book was good, but I unfortunately saw the film first and therefore was inundated with predrawn images. This was my first experience of Cormac, and I enjoyed the style and his way with words.I found the book to be really good, but I made that unfortunate mistake of watching a film version first, fortunately the film version was quite faithful to the book."
3,"Cinematographer's dream, reader's nightmare...","Reading this book, I could see why it must have made a magnificent movie- it reads like a cinematogepher's dream. That said, I wasn't a huge fan of the voice, the lack of punctuation, and the need to count lines of dialogue in places to figure out who was talking. The book is violent, the language spare, and after finishing it, I may just rent the movie after all."
4,Great story and characters....weird writing.,"I saw the movie before even knowing it was inspired by this book. I loved the movie so I ran for the book!The story told in the book is a great modern western-style tale very different from most fiction books I have read before. The main vilain is such a horrific character (like in the movie). The main idea of McCarthy's plot is simple but he develops it in a very efficient way.I must admit I found the Sheriff's philosophic thoughts a bit long compared to the story. The main action between the hero and vilain could have been developed a bit more. Finally, the writing style is weird and often annoying (missing quotation marks to identify dialogue, weird sentences and punctuation...).Occasionnal readers => the book is pretty short and easy to read compared to the average fiction book.Anyway, 5 stars for the main story and 3 for the writing ;)"
1,"depressing, depressing, depressing!!",wish I would never had read it... a total waste of my precious time. I have no idea what any good redeaming quality this story was trying to portray..
1,About as fast paced as a retard with a rock in his shoe,"The narrative style was addled with redundancies, which made the story tedious to read. And the way the action was described sounded more like reading it from a police report. I did however appreciate the theme and subject matter, especially being that male readers are sincerely neglected by contemporary literature. At least it wasn't anything similar to the rest of the garbage that pollutes the books shelves these days, something like a rehashed court room thriller plot, or some derivative theme about the zany misadventures of bisexual dating in Metro-America."
1,LITERARY NEED NOT EQUAL DISSATISFYING,Literary novels are rarely fun to read and popular novels are rarely well crafted. This one errs on both sides of the fence. I much preferred Sisters of Glass to this one. Success can and does ruin good writers.
1,A Dud,"I bought the hype, plus his previous works. I didn't finish the book because I could no longer tolerate this p.o.s. If the review had zero stars, it would be more appropriate."
2,I *wanted* to like this book.,"While McCarthy is a talented writer, I found ""No Country for Old Men"" to be a pointless rambling of carnage with a large side-order of belly-aching about the ills of the world and a perplexingly disconnected ending. Other than giving the reader a huge dose of blood, sadism and sermonizing, I really didn't see the point of the book. For those who like some kind of plot and resolution to their stories, you might want to skip this one."
1,is there anything one can learn from a novel?,"is there anything one can learn from a novel? The answer is perhaps not always a straight forward ""no"" but in the case of 'no country for old men' it definitely is. The ultimate impact of this book on reader is pessimism and the feeling of being cheated by a pulp-fiction disguised as ""literature"". I think it is no more than a Quentin Tarantino type disturbance.It contains an extremely violent (almost disgusting) pursuit story combined with very odd, very conservative and ultimately boring family-values philosophy. It seems that for the author the inner thoughts like: I took a war decoration which I don't deserve , or , 'I am so lucky because I am married with my wife' reflects the highest level of sophistication one can possibly reach at the end of her/his life.There is a deeper world than this !!!!"
1,Another Disappointment,"I thought I had discovered a life long author for myself after reading ""All The Pretty Horses,"" but then came disappointment with the other titles in his border trilogy. I looked forward to ""No Country..."" after reading generally positive reviews, including that this book was more ""accessible"" than previous works. Well, accessible it was in terms of the lack of subtleties, but a very off-putting story filled with violence and unsympathetic characters. I'm afraid Mr. McCarthy has had it in this reading room."
1,Mutton Dressed As Lamb,"This was the first of this author's books I've ever read. I bought the hype and got the book. I know nothing about this author but from this book it appears to me he is not from Texas. Not even Texans act so Texan. Which is saying alot.I think John D. McDonald and Jim Thompson and others of their ilk do a vastly superior job of examining what i assume Comac was exploring. I thought the characters simplistic and foolish and i felt no connection or curiosity about any of them. It seemed like the whole first half of the book was dedicated to packing and unpacking bags. The phony terse narration seemed like a Ralph Lauren cowboy add with an occasional Important Message or Meaningful Thought not so subtly sprinkled about.As a light weight crime thriller, the book is unsatisfying, as literature, it ain't. Read Cain,Woolrich,McDonald or Thompson and just ignore this ultimately boring and condescending musing of a giant of american Literature."
4,No country for old men,Good book goodNo country for old men. Blah blah table rabble blah we we rut you add nice add toys very nice good book
3,It was ok,I felt the book was difficult to read since it was lacking quotation marks. I had to reread many sections cause I couldn't tell if it was a conversation or not. Some things happened without an explaination regarding how it came about. I did enjoy the story line though.
3,Very Little Flesh and Blood Amongst the Carnage,"I picked up my first Cormac McCarthy novel in 1995. It was Blood Meridian. As good as it was, something about it felt incomplete. Over the years, I have read 6 more books by McCarthy, including this one. They all seemed to have something missing, but I couldn't put my finger on it. When I read this book, it hit me. All the characters are archetypes. They are not fully formed three-dimensional human beings. The natural world that surrounds them is much richer in thought than they are. Perhaps that's the point. I'm not sure, but it is ultimately unsatisfying. I wish that weren't true because Cormac is one of the most talented writers of the English language that I've ever read. Frankly, though I just need a little more."
3,Prettty good Jim Thompson,"This is a pretty goood Jim Thompson novel, more Cropper's Cabin or Nothing More Than Murder, than The Getaway or The Killer Inside Me, but still better than The Golden Gizmo and The Kill-Off. but if you like Texas crime fiction than this is a good 3 or 4 hour read..."
2,Tough Read,"I saw the movie, before I read the book. Saw the book sitting on the library shelf and figured I'd read it to get some understanding and clarification of the movie...NOT! I didn't understand the movie and the book really didn't help. Boy, this was a tough read. Besides the fact that there was limited punctuation, I just couldn't find the meaning of it all. The movie did follow the book very closely, except for the ending, I think, and while I was able to remember movie scenes as I read, a lot of it went WAAAAAAAAAYYY over my head."
4,Disturbing but well written story,"While very disturbing, I found myself very interested in the story and finished the book quite quickly."
4,"Intriguing story, flat ending","This book had me hooked from beginning to end. I quickly adapted to the writing style and the absence of most punctuation. The action was so good that I kept thinking this would make a good movie---until I got to the ending, which reminded me of ""Hannibal"". The ending is just plain flat. What became of Chigurh? I found myself thumbing back thru the book to see if I had missed something. It's a good read, worth 4 stars."
2,"SAD, WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN","A weak, confusing and largely pointless story from one of our greatest writers. I just feel so sorry. My condolences, Mr. McCarthy. Your immense talent has mostly deserted you here.The worst of it, as a friend of mine says, is that you can see the book it might've been. It probably could not have been as richly rewarding as his great novels, ""Blood Meridian"" and ""Suttree,"" but it could've been a lot better than this. (A similar book that is much more successful is Kem Nunn's ""Tijuana Straits."")Still, ""No Country For Old Men"" has its moments. Even for all its faults, it's much better than the usual bestseller cheese."
2,See the movie instead,"I saw the movie first, and had heard good things about the book, so I picked it up. Here's the quick of it: FORGET THE BOOK and see the movie instead.Don't get me wrong, the book content is respectable, but the formatting is horrible! Cormac (the magician!) doesn't use double quotes around ANY of the dialogue. Now, sure, that is fun and interesting and one may make an argument that it is even artistic, but guess what? It makes it not much fun to read. And I bought a book to be a ""good read"" not an exercise in trying to figure out where the writer meant to switch from dialogue to an internal thought process or narration. Seriously!So that is why I say see the movie, especially since the movie is so close to the book."
3,Well Written But Meaningless,"No Country for Old Men is well written, but it's hollow and meaningless. Conrad, Dostoevsky and Dickens, to name just a few great writers, explored evil. But McCarthy doesn't explore evil; he simply relates it via a character who cannot understand it. This is, at best, clever.I just read Herman Wouk's Winds of War and War and Rememberance. Unlike, McCarthy, Wouk dared write about important matters: war, love, loyalty, courage, cowardice, sacrifice ... But unlike McCarthy's, Wouk's style is often awkward.It's a pity that ""literature"" and the popular novel have gone their separete ways. If only Wouk could write like McCarthy. If only McCarthy dared to take on the world, as Wouk did.All things considered, I liked Wouk's novels better. But I'm just interested in McCarthy to read another one or two of his novels."
