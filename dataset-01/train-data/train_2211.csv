2,Works but....,"Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but it doesn't remember the station I leave it on. It works great after you get the station set right on the itrip and radio together you know. But when you turn car off and then back on, the itrip doesn't remember where you left the station. And even when you do get it back to the station correctly, it still doesn't work. I have to unplug and replug, then set station, then it works. Irritating. But will deal with for now. Am I doing something wrong?"
1,Fried 2 iPods,"This transmitter has been bad for me. There is a lot of static, the wiring tore at the base where it connects to the iPod, and it now seems to be the culprit in frying two iPods. Will not buy again."
3,Will not charge I-touch,"The product description was not acurate, it will not charge I-touch. I have been unable to find a station that does not have some static with the broadcast."
1,Maybe in Iowa,"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I suppose it is due to the fact that I live in downtown Miami and there is just too much airwave interference. Nevertheless, when I did find myself in a more rural area and the Ipod did work, the sound quality didn't even make it worth while.Long and short, get the Ipod hard wired into your car's stero system. I did, it sounds great and there is never any interference."
2,Not too happy but can work.,"I needed a transmitter that also charged my iPod so I bought this unit. The display is difficult to read on sunny days. I live in a very populous area where every other station is in use. Unused stations have alot of static and has sound bleeding through from the station before it. Transmitter is too weak to broadcast through without static. You cannot preset buttons so it is impossible to change stations while driving. Still, I can set it to 87.9, which is pretty clear in my immediate area."
4,Probably the best for this price,"This product works great so far. I think it depends on the car's audio as well. On a Ford's standard radio it has very little static at times. It was just difficult to find an open station spot on the radio though. But was surprised to see how easy it was to ""set up"". Plug and play. For this price I will bet it is the best one can get in this class."
3,Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter for ipod - weak & intermitted sound,"I was disappointed. Read previous ratings on product, took a chance it may work. As they stated: very weak signal to car radio, and signal drops when driving. I'll use until something with better (stronger) transmitter comes along."
2,Just a thought,"IF you have a cassette deck (yeah, I know they are going the way of the 8 track) consider an Xm Auto Cassette Adapter. Cheaper, less hassle, no static, no hassles with finding empty frequencies. It just works. I have both. I prefer the cassette. The big advantage to the Griffin is the recharging ability. For that, I will hold on to it. Of course if you live somewhere that has not filled the entire FM spectrum with jabber and cacophony, maybe the Griffin will work well (I have no way to check, living in cacophony central). And Eric's post sounds well thought out. Read that before you buy."
3,Good But not perfect,Just purchased this transmitter today. Had a hard time finding stations in my area (New York) so i used the default 87.9mhz.The sound quality isn't great and there are bits of static from time to time. Driving by cars using the same frequency interfered with mine causing interruptions and heavy bits of static. But i guess that's to be expected.But i use it and i figured it's better than nothing. I have times where static is minimal and i have no problems. But there are times when the static is unbearable causing me to shut it off. I tried other frequencies but the 87.9 was the best one overall. It's okay but has it's flaws.
3,doesnt charge my itouch,"works great, sound quality is wonderful compared to what I've used in the past. It doesn't charge my itouch though. Have new itouch with software update and it says it doesn't charge with this item when i plug it in. oh well, at least it sounds good."
2,So disappointed!,"I am very disappointed in the amount of STATIC that I hear when this product is being used! I have tried every single station, position in my car, and volume and it is always terrible! It was too much hassle to return this item so now I am stuck with it. I would appreciate any suggestions as to how to make the best of this product."
2,What happened to 87.9?!?!,"I had this product for a year and half and it worked great. Unfortunately it got busted up and I need a replacement. The new version I received was a huge disappointment. It barely could over power even empty bandwidths. This product was completely unusable in the city (unlike the old one) and lacked the ability to tune to station 87.9, which was the only reliable setting."
1,Not worth the money.,"Would not refer this product to anyone. Tons of static coming through. I've gone to the Griffin website, which lists the best FM stations to play through and still poor performance. Static constantly fades in and out. The display is nearly impossible to read in bright light. Two thumbs down."
3,Charger is great but....,The charger works great but can't figure out how to get the ipod to transmit thru the FM station.
5,Unbelieveable Results From This Device,"I was suprised at how well this worked. I had my doubts it would give me a clear, sharp sound out of my radio on an FM station using my iPod but it does. Sometimes I will be in an area where there are massive power lines that will distort the sound for a moment or two but they mess up my regular FM as well. I got the iTrip rather than putting a CD changer in my new car, for the price difference I can put up with a few moments of inconvenience. I am glad I went this route, it is more versatile than a CD changer and the iTrip with my iPod works great!"
3,decent,"I've had this product for a few months now and it works great: no problems yet. There is a small amount of static that can be heard over the music when the volume is turned up. This, however, is common for FM transmitters. Griffin might think of making the transmitter a bit more powerful so you don't have to turn the car's volume up so high: I have my volume cranked, almost to full, and it still sounds a bit ""distant.""Otherwise, a great product."
4,The best one the I've found,"I've tried many that have had the low volume and constant static, and this one has been great. I've had no problems whatsoever with this one!"
5,Great product,"This product came right away and on time. I purchased it as a gift for my brother because he was always borrowing mine. The newer models are so much more expensive and are not compatable with his older 2nd gen ipod nano, so it worked out great. I recommend this product over the wireless version, it's a crisper, clearer sound."
1,Useless in my Subaru Forester,"I bought this for a trip between Northern Virginia and Arkansas. Lots of rural driving where you wouldn't expect much interference from radio stations. We were unable to get a strong enough signal to listen to any music from my iPod. Sometimes an acoustical guitar would sound okay, but if they started singing, it was all over. It sounded like when you are driving over a hill going away from a distant radio station and you love the song and don't want to change the station even though it sounds horrible. You only really hear the song at all because you know in your mind how it goes.Per the instructions on the device, I switched it to Mono mode (that's supposed to boost signal), but that did not improve it. My Subaru Forester radio doesn't go down below 88.1, so I was unable to try using the lowest setting on the iTrip. This device may work well in some cars, but not in ours! I plan to see if I can return it. The only thing it did effectively was charge my iPod."
3,Ok reception but doesn't charge new Nano,"I have the newest iPod nano and went to the Apple Store to get an FM transmitter but the sales associate told me I could get an earlier model cheaper online. I specifically asked if it would charge the iPod as well and he said yes. Well, I ordered this FM transmitter and it works ok to play my Nano in the car but it won't charge. It shows a message that says something like 'Charging not supported with this accessory'. I also tried my friend's Monster FM transmitter and got the same message. Guess you need to buy the most up to date model to get all the bells and whistles, unfortunately."
3,So-So,"The product itself is fine, but the technology leaves much to be desired. Lots of static and audio goes in an out. Would not recommend."
1,Waste of money,"Well of course I knew it wouldn't sound as good as direct connection. But I didn't expect having to change the station 4 times every hour while driving through ""middle of nowhere"" Ohio. Either make it more powerful or stop making it at all, it's a waste of money."
4,Affordable Value,"This is an inexpensive FM transmitter that works pretty well. Don't leave it in the cold or heat as it will damage the screen. I would recommend it though, I have two."
4,Quality Product for the Price,"As stated in existing reviews, the sound quality is not the best and you must turn your volume up to hear the music, however I do feel that the product is worth the price that I paid ($37). I would have been disappointed if I would have paid full price ($60) 6 months ago before they went on sale/clearance. The recommended stations work very well in the Twin Cities and other large cities but do not work well (or at all) in rural places like southern Oklahoma."
3,Average for the type,"This is one of three Griffin iTrip adapters I have, it is probably the most convenient to use. The FCC requirements on these things limit the transmit power to something that is barely able to reach the car radio, but if you don't set this one to the higher power mode you'll be lucky to hear anything at all. I find more variation between vehicles than you might expect, I travel quite a bit and have used this in rental cars all over the US, Canada and the UK. It is especially useful that this can tune by 0.1MHz intervals which helps find a vacant frequency in other countries (where these may be illegal, as they are in the UK). Sound quality is usually OK, but if you find the noise level increasing you are probably conflicting with a local FM station and it's time to retune. The cassette interfaces provide much cleaner audio, but with more wires and sometimes with mechanical noise. This is in my travel kit now and I don't think there is a reasonable alternative."
1,Beware if you own a 4th Gen Nano,This product works reasonably well for transmitting the audio signal but it does not charge (as advertised) the newer I-Pod Nano's. I bought it specifically because of the ability to charge while on the road and it does not do this. Very disappointing and it is not listed anywhere in the information from Amazon and only in the most obscure location at Griffin Technology. I'll be returning it to Amazon.
4,Best one out there but...,"pros: not bulky, you can choose the exact station and create your own presets, charges most iPods, have decent power and lets you switch between stereo and mono sound based on how strong surrounding radio stations are. Radio screen lights up when you press the buttons so you can see the station numbercons: Doesn't charge 4th generation iPod Nano"
3,I Touch iPod,iPod iTouch when pluged in to cig. lighter works for transmitting music but will not work to recharge ipod. Fast Shipping!
3,"Ok, but does not charge IPod Nano 4G","The product seems to work well - little static, relatively clear sound, but do be warned: this will play (but will NOT CHARGE) an IPod Nano 4G."
4,"Nice product, but doesn't charge 3G iphone","When I first received it, it looked nice.I hooked it up in my car and realized that it didn't charge up my 3G iphone. Other than that, the music worked, and the sound was ok too."
3,"Ok, but not great","I was a bit disappointed when I tried to use this, as I found the tranmitter to produce a great deal of static on many different stations as well as a very weak overall sound. Griffin could definitely use a stronger transmitter. I think that would solve most of the units problems. It works as it says it does, but the static produced by the weak signal unfortunately offsets the benefits."
4,Worth the money,"My car doesn't have the FM frequency needed to use the international setting. And almost all of the FM frequencies around here are either taken or have some degree of static. I did find one frequency with very little static, and tried that with the Griffin. It was OK, but not great. Then, since my car has a power antenna and I seldom use the radio, I unplugged the power antenna. This made it much harder for the radio to pick up FM frequencies. With the antenna inop, the Griffin worked much better. I have to turn my stereo volume up quite a bit higher than normal, but the sound quality is good. No FM adapter is going to sound as good as a wired hookup, but this one is definitely worth the money."
2,Did not meet my needs!,"Two star rating is because the transmission/receiption is very poor on the product.I purchased this for my iPhone--while I understand the product description does not include the iPhone in any of it's claims. For the iPhone, the product does not charge...just for FUTURE REFERENCE."
2,Terrible reception. Does not charge ipod Touch 2G,"I bought this based on the reviews.On the positive side, the product is simple to use. I like this.However, the FM transmission must be very weak as the sound quality is terrible and it needs to be moved around to get good reception. It feels like moving around a metal hanger to get reception on an old TV (does this date me?). I have an XM radio that also transmits FM and the signal is much clearer.Additionally, this does not charge my ipod touch 2g, so it's not much help on a long car ride.Overall, not worth the money."
3,Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter,"Sound quality is not that great. It is hard to find an empty channel that doesn't have interference of some sort, especially in a busy city. It gets better when you are in less populated areas, but for most people this is not the application they are looking for. I happen to live in a sparsely populated area, but even then, the sound quality is not very clean. It works, it is sufficient. The price was lower on this one, and perhaps you get what you pay for."
4,Great item. Although I wish it would play without being plugged in.,This item works very well. I wish you could also use it without it being plugged in.
1,is not worth it,"Nice in the web page, but is a really bad product, is not worth the money and do not work well, buy something a littel more expensive with more quality."
4,Decent transmiter for $10,"I got this for my wife so she could listen to her ipod on the go. Its easy to use and works well when put into the international mode and set to 87.9 fm. My only complaint is that the stereo has to be turned WAY up to listen at a decent level. Its a minor one, but a complaint nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this transmitter though for its ease of use."
1,Don't buy if you have new ipod,Don't buy this item if you have a new iPod. It will not charge it. I was very disappointed.I have a very old Griffin which charged fine but the connector is not long enough to go into the iTouch when it is in the case. I called Griffin and they said this was the old model that does not support any new iPods.
2,Griffin iTrip Auto,"The model I received was not capable of charging my iPod. After checking with Griffin I learned that the model sent to me would not charge later model iPods. DLN Enterprises, LLC, who supplied the item agreed to exchange it for a later model that Griffin said would be able to charge my IPod. I recently received the later model from DLN and it works fine.I was very disappointed that the item didn't work as advertised but very satisfied with how DLN handled correcting the problem.Your star rating system doesn't accomodate this kind of problem, i.e., ""item doesn't work as advertised"".Re:Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black)Joe"
3,does not charge Ipod g4 and g5,"Be aware that the Griffin iTrip Auto Charge and Play DOES NOT actually charge a 4th or 5th generation iPod (despite the claims). Read the fine print and it says its compatible with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation ipods. You will have to also buy a 12V car charging unit if you buy this unit. Surprised me after I bought it and plugged it in and my iPod put a message on its screen that said can not charge this unit.Otherwise works fine, easy to use, and even though I live in Chicago its signal is strong enough to block out other radio station's bleed in on the limited available free frequencies. I put the transmitter on my dash close as I can get it to the car antenna and it picks up great - listening in stero mode, no problems."
2,terrible,WON'T charge my iPod Touch and the interference is so strong that u can barely hear anything while driving. I returned it and had to pay the shipping fee. Somehow it got lost via USPS and never got refunded. Horrible experience.
3,It doesn't charge,"This item claims to be a charging unit, but when plugged into IPOD it says it doesn't support charging, but plays over FM just fine."
1,Do not waste your money!,"It doesn't work, pure and simple. If you like scratchy sound, poor audio, unreliablity, then this is the product for you. Otherwise, save your hard-earned money and get a different product."
1,Another fine quality product from China,"I ordered one of these on 11/21 as a replacement for another itrip that died within a year. Got the item from Blue Proton and it did not work, nothing but static. Total waste of money and time. I returned this item on 12/8. Do not buy from Blue Proton as it has been over a month they have had my money and I still don't have anything to show for it. Do not buy crap from china either."
2,Does charge an iPhone 3G,"Will not charge an iPhone 3G. Get the good old, ""not a supported device"". Modulates, but I'm unsure if I'm draining my battery when using it. Definately does not charge."
1,Doesn't work!,I could not get the transmitter to work with my car stereo. All the stations I tried came through fuzzy. It was awful. They're sending me a replacement but we'll see. Not worth the money/time/effort.
1,Terrible product,This Griffin I trip transmitter produces a terrible sound quality through the car radio. I am verry dissapointed in this product.
1,Save your money.,"Though its price may appeal to you, remember that you get what you pay for. If you buy cheap, you get cheap. The sound quality? Very poor. Its ability to automatically scan for suitable fm stations? Abysmal."
4,iTrip Transmitter and Charger,"Arrived quickly in good condition. Works great. The only drawback is that the station reception tuner doesn't go down further than 88.1. I was used to setting my old iTrip at 87.9, and it's hard to find a station without a radio signal at 88.1 or higher."
2,Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black),"This is not that great, it was supposed to charge your ipod and it does not and it is not compatible with my iphone"
2,You get what you pay for,"I found this product adequate at best. The reception is often poor and I have to frequently change the frequency to try and maximize on decent sound quality. That being said, it was inexpensive and is adequate for its intended purpose"
5,Love It,Less money does not mean less quality. I've had three other types of these transmitters and this one works perfectly and is by far the best. By not using the headphone jack i have a very firm connection that is somewhat locked in and the connector works through both the cases I have for my iPod Classic 5thG 80 GB and my iPod Touch 2G. I love this transmitter.
4,cheap and good quality,price is very reasonable if you compare to the electronic store giant. good quality. not sure if it is legal to use international signal in US
1,Better get a cassette adapter and a separate ipod car charger,My iTrip didn't do anything for me for the following two reasons:1) The charger doesn't charge the iPod nano and still drains down its battery.2) It's nearly impossible to find an empty slot on the FM spectrum. Neighboring stations are always breaking through and adding noise. I bought a car charger (in this case I bought the Sony one through Amazon; no opinion on the other brands) and the sound output is so spectacular compared to the iTrip. Very good thing that my car is equipped with a cassette player!
4,Griffin 9501-TRIPCB iTrip Auto,"This is a great product, the cord could be a bit longer but works well"
1,worst electrical purchase ever!!!,I bought a new ipod and case but i was missing somwething to play in my car so i so this product and seem like it sounded good so i bought it ... I have had the worst sound ever in my car and sometimes the reception is not even there i would advise against this product i ended up buying a device that you put in your cassete deck and has a wire to you ipod cause the fm transmitter was so horrible..
2,2.5 stars,I guess I must be the only one here who thinks this thing just doesn't work that well. It works........but static is a constant problem making your music sound fair to poor. This happens to me about 60% of the time. When it works well the sound is very good....the key is WHEN IT WORKS.
4,IPOD FM tuner,Works pretty well. Still get a little static. Haven't tried the trick suggested on the website. Will try.
2,Not as good as my old Itrip,The company was prompt no problem with them. The product however does not work very well. I have tried several stations and it fades. Maybe I got what I paid for.
4,Griffin iTrip Auto,"Great product. Worked great in my car. However, I did have some problems with finding a good frequency to use on the radio."
3,can not make it stay at one frequency when turned on,"This product works fine. I set it up @87.9Hz on international mode. The sound is loud and clear. So I decide not to return it. But there's surely one thing annoying. Every time I start the car, it will pick up some random frequency to play, then great noises come out of my car's speaker 'cos the radio is still @87.9Hz. So I always have to remember turn off my radio when I stop the car and need to press the ""preset"" button several times after I start it. What's worse is that if I don't connect my itouch quickly enough, this thing automatically turns itself off and will never wake up again! I need to replug it in the lighter so that it can reboot. I don't know whether this is deliberately designed or a bug just mine has. But these little crap operations really piss me off sometime."
3,Griffin 9501 iTrip Auto,The Griffin 9501 iTrip Auto was delivered on time and performs well here in the Eastern Sierra of California where we maybe have three radio stations to serve our rural area. When we travel in and around any large metro area the product gets serious bleed over by all of the radio stations in the area and is pretty much useless. Hence the three star rating.
2,eh.,"lots of static. biggest problem i have with it.stations start @88.1 (when it should start @ 87.1, lots of clean bandwidth in between there).if you do find a decent station, at times you get an unexpected burst of a loud station coming though. not good.cheaper than most transmitter/chargers but not sure its worth it.im a little disappointed, but you get what you pay for."
1,Do not buy it from TechNGnet,"Even after following the advice of Eric Williams in his 5 * review I still got background noise on all frequencies in my 2006 Accord. I had read the 1 * reviews before buying this advice. Based on L. Brass ""Skip"" review mentioning amazon.com's no-hassles return policy I'd decided to give this device a try. Unfortunately, I was not paying attention and ordered this from TechNGnet. They were slow in providing me with a RMA. Two weeks after they received the item I still hadn't received my refund. Only after contacting them did I received the refund. TechNGnet reduced my refund by 20% for a restocking fee for the item returned in the original package with no damage. If you are unsure whether this item will work do not buy it from TechNGnet."
1,Reviews did not live up to my experience.,"I tried ALL the FM frequencies and only two would work. But that only lasted 5-8 minutes then static would overtake that station, making this product useless. I have a 2004 Prius with a standard radio. I think next I'm going to try DICE Electronic product that hooks into the standard radio for a DIRECT (non-FM dependent) connection."
5,Better Than What I Thought!!,"I used to have an old fm transmitter a few months ago until I got so sick of the static friction running between my engine and my 5th track of pink floyd.It got so unbearable that I got a CD player installed in my car and just made cd's for the longest time.After that I got an iPod and eventually grew to try a new fm transmitter, or to at least give it one more chance.I've been using a cd player in my car for about a few months now and the quality of a cd is undebatable.I expected a nasty noise to run through these songs once I put them on and guess what, it worked PERFECTLY!!!Perfect CD Quality!!Usually I'd say that an fm transmitter would be last case scenerio but this one really delivers great performance and gives complete satisfaction to anyone seeking one!!"
3,"Good function, limited power","The unit works as advertised. The instructions are clear and it is easy to use. It seems to have limited power, as others have noted. It works OK in our Toyota Sienna, and we have to arrange the cable just right for it to work in our Saturn Ion."
5,Awesome Product,The iTrip is an excellent product. I bought one for my daughter and I had to buy another one for my son. They love it.
3,"Quality product, but limited performance in my area","The product itself is one of quality, but there are not may quite FM stations in SoCal. It's difficult to keep a clean static free connection between the iTrip and any ""clean"" frequency; something always leaks in. I wish I had an input jack on my stereo to pipe-in my iPod, but I don't..."
4,iTrip,"Good product, but you do have to search for stations manually. Other than that its works great."
1,Don't jiggle it,This is a cheap device. I can't move the fm transmitter otherwise I'll hear static over the radio. I think there is a short in the cord or it's just cheaply made. It works as long as it stays stationary.
5,an excellent adjunct to the ipod,This is a major improvement over earlier models. It was very simple to set up and works perfectly every time. Selecting a station is far easier and does not require downloading software into iTunes like earlier versions. Reception is excellent in my car (2001 Prizm). Volume is strong. It also recharges the Pod. I am very satisfied.
1,Very Weak Signal! Do NOT BUY!!!,"Previously, I owned another iTrip for the 3rd generation iPod. I had minimal problems with the signal strength on that one. This product is terrible by comparison. The signal was too weak (even on the ""international stations"") to work in even the rural midwest. Would definitely not buy this product. It is the worst thing I have every purchased off Amazon in my life. I returned it after 2 days. Save yourself the hastle!"
2,Interference,"FM transmission stations don't hold well, especially in the city. Have to change settings often even over short driving distances."
2,"Does the job, barely.","I tried using the iTrip Auto for a week, and even after choosing the correct frequencies in Griffin's StationFinder application for the Los Angeles area, I was not able to get an acceptable signal. The audio coming out of the iTrip Auto was too quiet and so I had to turn up my stereo's volume, which made the background static even more noticeable. There was also a lot of distortion when it plays songs that sound perfectly fine with headphones. Maybe this works better in a rural area, but for us people in the big cities with lots of local radio stations, the iTrip Auto's sound quality is horrible at worst to barely acceptable at best. For something that has an MSRP of $69.95, it is not worth it, even when on sale."
4,Great Buy,"I had ordered this for Christmas last year, but it was back ordered and I didn't receive it. The price at the time was around $50. When I saw the price was cheaper, I knew I had to buy it. The sound quality is exceptional, especially on those un-used frequencies like 87.9FM. One thing that got a little annoying was that if a song wasn't playing off my iPod, the iTrip would shut off after a while, and the radio would play static. Not a big deal but I thought I should mention it. All in all, a good purchase at a great price."
3,iTrip is OK,"I am glad I purchased this at the Amazon.com price as opposed to the full retail price. It works OK, but volume is an issue. This is the newer version that works independently from the volume control on the iPod, but you have to turn the radio volume up full blast to get a normal sound output.It works well as an auto charger, so that is a plus. Overall I am glad to have it - it's just not perfect."
2,Not so clear,I have heard better more clear transmitters. I have tried different stations and different locations in my car and still cant get a static free signal. I am disappointed in this product.
3,"Easy to set up, but still sounds fuzzy","This item looks nice and it is easy to do the hack that is described at the top of the reviews to set the frequency to 87.9, however there is still a good amount of fuzzyness that tends to come and go randomly, both in the city and in the middle of nowhere. My next car will have a built in aux jack for my ipod."
3,Griffin iTrip iPod Auto Player,"Overall the product is satisfactory, however, it does not allow one to use an FM frequency under 88.1. I am finding it difficult to find an open frequency in the ranges allowed, but I could if it would allow usage in the 87 MHZ range. I'm wondering why I cannot use that frequency range? That is the only reason I gave it only 2 stars in the ""ease of use"" category."
3,Good when it works,"Good when it works, but will stop working randomly for no reason. I have to unplug it and when I plug it again it will work. Broadcast will get staticy even if no radio station is on the setting. Better than some others I have tried but not great. For $20 with shipping it's just OK."
4,iTrip Transmitter Review,I liked everything about this except it says it charges your ipod and it does not charge my ipod. Kind of disappoiting but I still like it.
4,All-in-all a good deal,"All-in-all this device does exactly what I needed it to. I'll admit that the sound quality isn't going to blow anyone away, but it works and it was a great price. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to listen to your ipod and charge it at the same time, then I would definitely reccomend this product."
3,Does NOT work with 3rd generation... no audio control,"it transmits fine, but doesn't charge the third generation of iPods.. and you'd think, fine, just like any other non-charging transmitters... no... this doesn't allow you to control the volume from the ipod... which is a huge negative for me... good price though :)"
2,itrip,"this transmitter did a poor job of transmitting a clear signal to the car, i would still have bad static on a perfect station."
3,Some Interference,"Item did not enable me to access the International FM range, thus had to tune a local, empty?, FM spot. Had some annoying interference and had to find an optimum spot in the car (dash, console) to minimize static interference. Nevertheless, for the price paid on Amazon, I'm willing to fight some aggravation. iPOD Touch informed me that the ""Charger"" was not going to charge!"
1,Does not Charge latest ipod nano (4th Gen),Works but does not charge the latest Ipod nano 4th gen. I bought this specifically for this ipod and it is confusing as to what it is compatible with . Griffin should be clearer to state what it is NOT compatible with because it appears as though it is. It does work with it (although sound is not great).
4,it's a great product!,"works terrific for me in the car! the only downfall is that unlike some other fm transmitters, you can only use it in the car or where there is an ac adapter... but the sound is pretty clear. i like it.. sounds like radio sound - but that's because that's what it is! i don't know why some of you expect it to be crystal clear like a cd or lossless mp3."
5,Great product,"Although i've heard that this product can be a little iffy in places like New York where there are almost no free radio waves, it worked perfectly for me in a big city in South Carolina."
4,Good value for the price,"The sound quality is better than I expected. I would highly recommend buying this type of model vs the cradle design. I had bought the cradle version in the past and it not only looked unattractive against the dash but it also tended to loosen up and fall over time. With this ""in-line"" type of design, I can actually lay the ipod next to my lap and easily change songs....all while keeping my eyes on the road of course :) Also, it does a great job of charging as well."
2,radio transmitter for an Ipod in your car,this product is a great idea and i have some friends who love it. the one we have gets static alot. it stinks because you hear static during the songs even if you change the radio station.
5,Auto charger,charger works great- shows which channel you are on for the station that needs to be blank if you wanted to listen to your ipod in the car.
4,Good quality,It does what it is meant to do with a reasonably good quality. It is cost effective. I would recommend it for someone who is not looking at extended features.
3,Good but...,"I like the quality, brand, and the functionBUT, it will never replace the wired cassette.. at least not this product"
3,Okay for the money,"This was supposed to charge the Ipod and it does not, so I am not that thrilled with it. It also starts over every time you turn off the car and restart it. Annoying. However, the price was great so I am not going to complain anymore."
4,Sound quality is ok.,It works well on newer car stereos. Only problem I have with it is you lose sound quality. Don't try to use it on a cheap car stereo because it sounds horrible.
5,Great buy!,I've had several other FM transmitters and I think this iTrip ranks right up there with any Apple product. I'm very happy with the quality of sound it outputs and find it's simplicity of use a bonus.
3,itrip auto transmitter,"it gives off static if you move the transmitter around while it is playing. the sound does not turn up as loud as the radio. overall, ok product for the money spent."
3,Just a Cable,"I didn't know it at the time, but I would have preferred a transmitter that doubled as a dock/holder. With this device, your iPod/iPhone is still rolling around loose in your car. You may be okay with that; it's a matter of personal preference. Otherwise, this transmitter works as advertised; no issues."
4,It does the job,Easy to use and works as per the product description. Only complain I have is the volume is lower than the one from CD player.
2,Super static noise!,"I don't know why but no matter WHAT I do you can always hear a faint static noise in the back and thats IF I get lucky! Even the stations that it recommends isnt clear. It was a waste of money because I LOVE MUSIC AND ANYTHING THAT DISRUPTS IT, EVEN THE LITTLEST THING IS THE MOST ANNOYINGEST THING EVER!!!!!! I recommend just sticking to burning CD's or if your car has an auxiliary jack, USE THAT. iTrip should just be your last resort...but I don't think I'll ever be using mines."
2,Did not work as expected,"I expected this to charge my ipod touch and iphone 4s and it does not. Its clunky to work with and I was disappointed with the lack of charging, even though the description said it would charge these devices as it plays."
4,Good ipod accessory,The transmitter works well. It can be difficult to adjust it to a frequency with no signal. I drive a lot and so cross areas in which there was not signal on a station and then there is so that can be an issue where the transmitter needs readjusting but once a good frequency is found it works well and is not complicated. Good buy.
1,It didn't work!,This product didn't work when i recieved it so i sugest not to buy from this person/ company!
1,Useless piece of equipment,The charger works fine but sound quality is so bad you might as well plug in a set of cardboard speakers from the 99cent store. Shocking!
2,more the concept than the product,"i just want a way to listen to my ipod in my car without having to change out my deck. well i have purchased several of these type products, and am always disappointed. i grow irritated with them as i HATE static, and in San Diego, it is nearly impossible to find a channel that is unoccupied. probably no fault of this device, but i now give up on FM transmitters."
4,Best iPod Car Adapter I've Used So Far,"As the title indicates, this is the best overall iPod adapter I've used. The sound quality is very good, far better than any stereo transmitter system I've used. The only slight inconvenience is that there is no way to keep the iPod charged as it is being used in the car unless you buy additional equipment. The other slight inconvenience is that sometimes the volume adjustment is best done directly on the iPod itself. But overall, I was very satisfied, and the price is VERY reasonable."
3,"Great for older iPods, not so much for the iPhone or new iTouch","It came with everything (plus some more stuff like earphone splitters and extra usb cable, so I was happy about that. What I was not particularly happy about was the fact that in the product details it neglected to mention that if you are using a iPhone or 3G iTouch, it does not charge. Other than that, everything else works, the transmitter quality is good and works fine."
3,Serves it's purpose,Really pretty design but that's about all. It's kind of rough on the skin and doesn't offer much warmth. You still need another comforter for those very cold days. My daughter seems to like it though and I got her the sheet set that goes along with it. It pills up after washing so be careful. Overall pretty good value though not the best.
2,Somewhat Italian...,"I was initially attracted to the Floto Milano briefcase because of the smart design, reasonable price and Made in Italy stamp. Indeed, from several feet away the item is a handsome piece. Upon closer inspection however, the quality of leather and metal components leave something to be desired (e.g. the metal closure buckle rattles infuriatingly whenever I'm driving). Although reasonably well stitched and polished, it isn't made to the same standard one would expect from an Italian-made leather product. It is clear that this briefcase was fabricated in one of the Chinese-owned (and staffed) sweatshops proliferating in northern Italy. Be guided accordingly."
4,So Cute!,"My husband is very big into football, and this being our third boy, I'm starting to enjoy all the Bengals themed things around our house. This little kit is great because it has stuff for different stages. Only thing I didn't like was that the box was all banged up. I wouldn't have given it as a gift because of that."
2,not my cup of... blood,"I give it an eh for effort. The visuals and audio are shoddy at best, the acting is amongst the lowest caliber I have recently seen and the ghetto-to-riches throwback is just plain, well, ludicris. If you're a fan of boobies and blood then this will be more than entertaining, but if you want production value, terrific acting, and a magical movie moment... then you will be sorely disappointed. I liked the ending, can't say I saw it coming!"
1,Dont buy this,"This is not a good bad movie, it's just a horrible waste of time. Do not waste your money on this crap."
3,My buoy,"you can carry your spare spear, knife, tour fish clip. i made a good purchase, but i change the float chamberfor another material or plastic more durable."
4,KEEP IT!!,HORROR SHOW AKA HOUSE pt.3 IS HARD TO FIND SO WHEN YOU FIND IT KEEP IT.YOU'LL MOST LIKLEY ONLY FIND IT ON VHS.THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.
4,It's a toss up..Shocker or The Horror Show......,"And in reality it is just that, a toss up. The movies are quite simular in many ways: but for my money I choose ""The Horror Show"" over Wes Craven's ""Shocker"" because I feel that the acting along with the special effects over rule ""Shocker"" by far. And for out and out scares, this one can do it. So with that much said I rate it a 4."
4,wierd...but fun and scary! more like 4.5 stars!,"The Horror Show (ALSO KNOW AS HOUSE 3)Upon his execution by the electric chair, mass murderer Max Jenke or ""Meat Cleaver Max"" curses Detective Lucas the man responsible for his capture. Electrocuting Max however has not ended his reign of terror but given him a whole new lease of life. Max soon returns from the dead to exact his hideous revenge.The horrors he performed before his death are insignificant compared to the circus of evil he now unleashes on the lucas family. soon not only is he losing his mind bu this house is haunted! With the help of only a jaded college professor he must make sure the next time Max gets sentenced to death, he dies. for good."
2,"Been looking for HOUSE III, well here it is.","I saw the first two HOUSE movies when I was young and liked them during that time. When I got older I found HOUSE IV at a video store and rented it. I didn't even know they made a part III! After I saw part 4, I put the hunt out for 3, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I asked video stores and everything, but they never even heard of HOUSE III! I knew if they made a 4, their had to be a 3 out there somewhere, so I went to the internet and found it. The reason I couldn't find HOUSE III is because it was retitled for U.S. release as THE HORROR SHOW. I ended up buying it to see what it was like. I was very disappointed. First of all, it had nothing to do with the first two HOUSE movies. It did however provide a good cast. MGM really should retitle it and release it as HOUSE III: THE HORROR SHOW to avoid confusion in the states for people looking for the nonexistent HOUSE III"
1,house 3 doesn't exist,"they never made a house 3. last time i checked this was a great subject of embarassment for the maker of house 4. this has obviously been done recently to lessen that humiliation. this movie may be that old, but the name house 3 isn't."
5,The Sound of Latin House,Great songs on this non stop compilation with some hard to find tunes. Perfect blend of latin tinged house.
5,great faucet,none of the hardware stores(this includes home depot and lowes) carry a modern wall mount kitchen faucet. this is a must faucet for any wall mounted kithcen. works great.
5,Delta discountinues excellent kitchen wall mount 200 single handle faucet,why did Delta discontinue model # 200 wall mount single lever kitchen faucet the best wall mount kitchen faucet ever made ?
1,As wall mounted..Forget it,Instructions for handset is to turn a tab around and re-insert tomake a hook to hang handset on. 6 times part fell inside the phone.After three hours I returned product......and went with another brand.Very disappointing. poorly designed phone.
4,Best Tasting Chicken Soup Base,"Purchased this item for my husband who is the chef in our home! He has tried several different products and has made this one his choice. In his opinion it tastes the best, has a long shelf-life, and is moderately priced. It works extremely well with tomatoes which is a definite plus as we love Italian cooking! I do hope Amazon continues to carry this product as we have found it increasingly difficult to find in the rural area we live in."
4,"Tasty, but Does Contain MSG","Just so you know, this stuff does contain a noticeable amount of MSG. Anyone sensitive to it will have a reaction if you use a lot. And six jars of 16 ounces is A LOT. Still, it does the job, is quite ""chicken-y"" without strong off-flavors, and I use just a bit in many soups and sauces without my wife (who doesn't like MSG) having any problem."
5,Chicken Base,"This is an excellent tasting chicken base This restaurant quality chicken base can be used to add flavor to not only soups, but stews, gravy, or any other dish that you can think of that needs some additional chicken flavor, for a fraction of the price of what's available in the grocery stores."
1,full of glutamates,"I typically make my own broth with just veg scraps, herbs, and chicken or beef bones and used that to make my soups. Against my better judgement, I bought this brand as a back up. It took me a few days to realize why I was getting headaches and other signs of glutamte ingestion when I hadn't seen it on the label...after the most recent and worst headache, hand swelling, palpitations and general ick feeling, I googled the company and found out that yes indeed MSG IS in the soup. I immediatelt threw it in the garbage and dumped all my lovely soup down the drain. I used much less than was recommended and was made ill, I can only imagine how bad it would have been if I'd used the whole amount!! I thought MSG and other glutamtes had to be labeled? There are people who would get very sick from that fake flavor enhancing, worse than I did. Yuck. From now on, I stick to making my own broths, can't trust the labels to give you the whole list of chemicals in the sludge."
3,OOOPS,"I got a jar of this stock base locally and decided that I loved it. So, I ordered the case from Amazon. Certainly the providers did nothing wrong. I just don't seem as fond of it as I was initially."
1,Check out the ingredients on this product!,"I make homemade soup often. Bought Orrington Farms base, because a FARM product should be good, right? Upon tasting the version I bought at my local supermarket, I couldn't believe how bad it was. I looked at the ingredients; now I get it. Salt, corn and chemicals are the first 7 ingredients. Oh, then we we have chicken fat at number 8! Yes, it does taste like salt and chemicals. I will find better brands or get the standard canned version broth."
1,Do Not Wast Your Time/Money,"I have had the XP4000 for 2 months. It makes good coffee/espresso however, the frothing devise works poorly and is unreliable. I sent the machine out for repairs. The service center took two weeks to replace a gasket and retrun freight prepaid. The frothing devise still works poorly. I am disappointed and believe I wasted my time, effort, and money. Do not recommend. PS - I see Krups has discontinued the XP4000.....I know why."
3,Krups XP 4000 Espresso Machine,"I don't know what's happened on my coffee maker. Actually, it's really fast for shipping so that I can get my product. However,there is something problems in my machine, particularly in making frothy milk which was not going well. And it always happens and drives me crazy. Now I am going to send to the company to maintainence. The shipping speed of product is good. But the quality of the product isn't very well."
1,Unsafe,"About five days ago I purchased a Krups XP4000. The problem I am having is that the piece that attaches to the steam nozzle, (cappuccino accessory), becomes detached during use and blasts hot liquid and steam for a two or three foot radius. This has happened about a half dozen times, including the very first time I used it. Initially, I thought it may have not been attached properly, however it has happened about a half dozen times since. I have been extremely careful not too touch the nozzle to the sides or bottom of the frothing cup, and also to be sure the accessory is clean and attached properly. Needless to say this could be a serious issue for a user or bystander. Krups was unresponsive to the issue. I have reported this product to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and have returned my purchase."
1,"Takes too much time, compared to the progammable XP4050","I returned the XP4000 to Amazon.com, I was very disappointed about how much time it required supervision to produce each cup of coffee. Nothing about the 4000 is automatic and it will drip until the reservoir is empty or you turn it off. I have made espresso comercially with successful results, I found the 4000 very frustrating. I am happy with the XP4050 which I ordered after returning the XP4000. If you have $200 more to spend try the Saeco espresso makers, the flavor is better, and it's what Starbuck's sells with their label on it! I am happy with the XP4050 for the money.P. TaylorLake Stevens, Wash."
2,Joe,This machine has ended up a disappointment. The steam wand only worked for a short time. Now only drops of water and very little steam are produced. I have tried multiple scale removal methods but none have worked. I have had mine for short of a year. Maybe this one is a fluke but I'm not sure where to turn.
2,KRUPS: QUESTIONABLE QUALITY CONTROL,"Arrived with a dent in overflow grill. Tried to use the Expresso function, it would not work. Called the distributor (""Z"")and got around for two weeks. Finally got email to return unit within a couple of days prior to end of thirty days period. Forced to use UPS Express at a hundred dollars plus. The distributor (""Z"") denied ever recieving the defective unit. Finally the local UPS office tracked the delivery and found they had recieved it. Subsequently refund to credit card followed."
1,It can not get any worst,Terrible... works for a couple shots and then ... water all over you counter top!!!
3,Fa deodorant,The product I received is not as pictured. It came in a different can and spray fragrance is different (not as good)from that in the pictured can.
2,The single version of YLSF is EDITED on this German import,"This is one of my favorite songs on Version 2.0. I wasn't too impressed with the ""Fizzy"" b-side here; the FLC version is down-tempo -- slow and jazzy, and evokes images of a sad, sultry siren singing in a cigarette-smoke filled, sparsely populated Las Vegas (... no, make that ""Reno, NV"")lounge. The Eric Kuyper dance remix butchers the innate beauty of the song.My biggest complaint, however, is that the original version of the song is edited (ie, cut short from the proper album version). You know the end of the song on Version 2.0, where the song segues off into about a minute or more of instrumentation and beats? Well, it lasts about 20 seconds on THIS CD single. I just got to love this song so much that that small section of music is one of the highlights of the song for me, and its absence is glaringly evident."
2,"Color me ""disappointed""","Well, I am a super-fan of remixes, and to say the least....I was let down. Even ""Get Busyy With The Fizzy"" was a downer.Make no mistake, the original album version has the most feeling and cannot be improved upon."
3,WRESTLEMANIA XV,"It was an ok event, WM XX was better though as overhyped a half good/half bad as that was. Here are my favorites matches from this event:Hardcore Title Triple Threat: Only bad thing? Holly won. I wish Billy would've won instead. Not a bad match though.I/C. Title Fatal 4 Way: Great I.C.Tile match, as far as this event goes.WWE Title: Rock and Austin? this was good, not their greatest though, but certainly not their worst.Hell In A Cell: Only because Undertaker was in it and he made it entertaining with his entrance and the aftermath. As for the match itself? It was ok."
4,not the best wrestlemania but still terrific,the matches were great except the hell in a cell that sucked but when bossman got hanged it was pretty funny the rock once again showed that he is the most electrofing man in sports entertainment by kicking out of the stunner the hhh kane match was great the hardcore match was kinda boring because it was in the ring for most of the time the intercontinental match was ok but not nearly as good as rock vs. shamrock at WM XIV or michaels vs. razor (one of the best matches ever) at WM X the tag match was great double j and the owen hart (rip) showed that they were the best damn tag team champs the part with boyz to men was stupid
3,http:We don't recomend it,I have personally seen every Wrestle Mania and as far as I'm concerned they have only got worse as they've gone along the WWF has pretty much destroyed WrestlMaina and booked it with a buch of jobbers like Bob Holly And Goldust
3,The Hype was too much,"Over the years, Wrestlemania has been the greatest PPV of the year, blowing away all competition. Though Wrestlemania was a very good PPV, it did not live up to the hype. The wrestlers did a good job, but there was something missing. To tell you the truth I don't know what it is, but you could feel it.A must see for Die Hard WWF fans, but otherwise, I don't recommend it."
1,Worst PPV I've ever seen,"This show was absolutely horrible. There were 9 matches, and 7 OF THEM WERE DUDS. The remaining two matches were only in the * to ** range. That would be terrible for any PPV, not to mention the fact that this is WrestleMania, which is supposed to be the most important show of the year. Average match was a 1/2 star."
3,Not Bad and Not Good,"Wrestlemania 15 was in 1999 and this DVD had a lot suck matches expect in Hell in Cell match and WWF/E Champion The Rock vs. Steve Austin were online. Do you think two good matches out of 10 matches in one DVD? That's not good to own it. It's up to you. On the record, I don't buy this wrestlemania 15, I was rental it."
3,WWF DVD is ok...but the people want WCW on DVD!,"This pay per view card, simply put, wasn't the best that I have seen, but certainly wasn't the worst. The DVD production and sound are very good, however the commentaries of Maivia and Austin are a bit disappointing as they are completly in character and don't provide much real insight into their match that wrestling fans enjoy. From now on I'll wait until WCW begins to produce DVDs of their programs, because they have much better performers, and are much more entertaining to watch."
4,"Main event as pretty good, but that's about it.","WrestleMania is perhaps known as the greatest specticle in Sports-Entertainment. In the fifteenth edition to this classic series, I give it four stars. An awesome performance by the Rock and Steve Austin in perhaps one of the classic battles of all time. The ""Hell in a Cell"" match (Undertaker vs. the Big Bossman) was a shame, however. Road Dogg should have been in the Hardcore match and Billy Gunn should have been in the IC match. Overall the PPV was pretty good, certainly could have been improved in several areas."
1,worst wm of all time dont waste your time,ok not one good match on here manking vs bigshow is ok only for the spots.worst rock vs scsa match that they ever had.
5,AWESOME,"As always, the WWF is the first to enter new territory. This DVD is awesome. All wrestling fans should buy it! Lets hope for more."
2,ragin' letdown,"the crowd is pretty quiet and for good reason, most of the matches are absolutely horrible, if I was there I would have spent most the time in the concession stands. All teh matches seemed to made on a fly and have no build up or relivance, worst being the hell in the cell, bossman is a midcarder for a reason, the four was IC match is a cluster *%^& of rest holds, and most matches seemed to drift into oblivion, Rock-Austin wasn't that bad, but Rock seemed to be running out of ideas-how many times can you hit the rock bottom for god sakes-non the less it was the best on the card, hold on, suprising X-pac-Shane was pretty damn good too, at least the had a plan rock."
5,The best WWF event in years!,"Rock vs Austin need i say more. This was the best wrestlemania ever,and that's the bottom line cause i said so."
5,15 YEARS IN THE MAKING!!,"See the undertaker return to wrestlemania more evil and brutal than ever reunited with his long time manager paul bearer more evil than ever to take on the big boss man in a hell in the cell match!!! the rock defends the belt against stone cold steve austin. ALSO featuring WWF superstars such as kane,tripleh,the big show paul weight,mankind,and much get this one if you want to see wwf attitude."
3,"Drojtskrojven@hotmail.com, 26 April SWEDEN","In it's way this Wrestlemania is grait, with The Rock/Steve Austin titlematch, X-pac against Shane Mcmahon and the boxing-fight. But it doesn't have the glamour and exitement like the old, classic Wrestlemanias. I miss the Hollywood stars and classic superstars. But as I sad, a lot of credit to The Rock and Steve Austin.Together they make Wrestlemania 15 a hot event. Buy it if you like the new wwf attidude."
3,Ur269@aol.com comments on WM 15,This was a decent Wrestlemania but by far not the best the hell in the cell match was slow and the other undercard matches were boring. What was an excellent match was the main event between Austin and the Rock this maych is worth the price of the tape because it was the most entertaining main event in Wrestlemania history
5,The Most Electrifying DVD...,This is one of the best pay-per-views and is now available on DVD. It's amazingly better on DVD than on VHS. This is the best way to experience the biggest wrestling event without leaving the comfort of your own home. I'd also recommend watching it on a big screen tv with surround sound!
3,"Good Show, Poor DVD","WrestleMania XV was a good show - not the best of the WrestleMania's but still better than the middle of the pack. This said, the actual program on the DVD is good; however, the technical aspects are fairly poor. The video clarity isn't anywhere near what the DVD format is capable of, and there are line crawls and picture distortion almost everywhere you look. The audio has been remastered for 2-Channel surround, but it hasn't seemed to improve it by much. In terms of extras, you get wrestler biographies, and some extra featurettes including the Rage party & technical guys telling you how the camera work is done. If you can look past the poor video quality, this is a worthy DVD."
3,ummmm this is WRESTLMANIA? It looked like a $30 RAW,"With the eception of Austin-Rock I was saddly disappointed. Give Shane-Xpac match credit it was good match and entertaining, and the Triple H turn was good. But everything else was not worth the money. Highly reccomended to rent first before buying."
5,good wrestlemania,not the best wrestlemania but it was up thee with the rest of them. if i had to rate the wrestlemania's it would be this1. wrestlemania 52. wrestlemania 43. wrestlemania 144. wrestlemania 155. wrestlemania 66. wrestlemania 107. wrestlemania 78. wrestlemania 89. wrestlemania 1210.wrestlemania 311.wrestlemania 1312.wrestlemania 913.wrestlemania 214.wrestlemania 115.wrestlemania 11that's the way it is. wrestlemania 11 was so bad i had to rip the tape up.wrestlemania 1 was horrible it was only two hours.wrestlemania 5 was the best Hogan vs Macho Man
5,yhe best ever,"yeah wrestlemainia XV the best one ever undertaker big bossman ""hell in a cell"" undertaker ----- him and ----- is the WWF champ.new HARDCORE champ is ----- [cant tell you now waych the best wrestlemainia ever to find out]"
4,An Above Average Wrestlemania!,"Topped of by a stellar Austin-Rock finally, Wrestlemania XV is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. Aside from the atrosity that is a Sable match and the just plain weird Taker-Boss Man HITC match, I enjoyed all the matches. Hardcore Holly shines in his bid to win the Hardcore strap from BA Gunn and Snow. Also enjoyable is the X-Pac-Shane brawl. I suggest you buy this tape to add to your collection!"
3,Wrestlemania XV,"This event had it's ups and downs, but it was average... Which isn't bad. While the Hell in the Cell match is often considered the worst HITC match, I disagree and found it to be the best match of the event, and the ending was real showmanship and true brutality. Shane O Mac/X-Pac was a good match, I was entertained. Other highlights of this event were Mankind/Big Show, HHH/Kane, and the four way Intercontinental title match. And watching the Rock get pinned always makes me smile, even if it is by Stone Cold (4/5 stars). The worst parts of the event, were BAD! The women's championship was HORRIBLE as well as the Boxing match. But, it's average nontheless."
5,Loved it!,I read it and it scared the living daylights out of me! I couldn't go near a doll for weeks! I loved it. I simply couldn't put it down until I had finished the last page. I thought it was just great. Now THAT'S what I call true horror!
5,Okay,Ruby Jean Jensen is a great horror writer in her time and will live on with her books she had written.
5,Corel Draw,This is a good pakage .It is well written and glad it was still for sale. Thankyou very much. Clem
4,Indians! Indians! and More WAMPUM!!!,"This book is a good book if you want to learn about how colonists changed the lands of Americans east coast when they invaded in the 1700's. Obviously, it is called ""changes in the land"", hence the land changing. The author repeats himself a lot in this book, but he does this to the point of where it is stuck in your head rather than just being idiotically repeated, which is a good thing. Definitely pick this up if you have a project due on early colonial arrivals in America for a school class. Looking inside the book for the first time, the text is sooo tiny, but reading the page goes by surprisingly fast...its almost voodoo or something!4/5"
3,don't buy without a widescreen TV at home,"it plays nice and I was able to get rid of my CD player and use this for both CDs and DVD. However even though you can supposedly set the machine to zoom when playing widescreen DVDs on a regular TV, the zoom feature does not work. My old cheaper DVD player did this. And many of the settings can only be changed when you hit ""stop"", not while it is playing."
2,Worked great until it died... :(,I bought this DVD changer 2 years ago because my old player would not read discs created by my Pioneer Tivo/DVD writer (DVD-R format). The Sony DVP-NC665P played everything I put in it beautifully until a couple weeks ago. Now it will read nothing. :( And of course it is out of warranty so Sony will charge me either $108 to replace it or $133 to repair it. Mind you I purchased it for not much more than that... Ugh. So I think I will not buy any more Sony DVD changers.
1,also worked for about a year readin less and less DVDs,and now it cant read any DVD's - there are countless reports of this problem with the unit - the risk of it failing is high.
3,Picture quality is good but have issues,"The quality of the movie images good for this product but I have 2 issues 1) Since this product allows 5 different discs to be loaded, with the remote that was provided it does not allow the user to be able to select a disc to be played.. the only way I could find to play a particular disc was to manually select before playing and2)I have copies of DVDs that were given to me and they would not play on this player.. only original movies would play."
2,Won't Read My DVDs?,"I have ALWAYS been a fan of Sony. Most of my electronic equipment are Sony products. My DVD player is the second product to go out after merely 3 years of ownership. I am glad to know that this is a common problem (the spinning of the dvd without reading), and will invest in another product. If the normal life of a dvd player is 3 years, then I would give this player 3 stars; however I am not ready to admit that this is acceptable."
3,sweet shola,"shola was taunted as the next british r&b; superstar in the late 90's. She's been compared to Faith Evans. i really like her vocal style she doesn't go overboard with the usual soul riffing and vocal histronics.this cd is mostly filled with harmonius midtempo tracks.stand out tracks arethis i promise u, sym4ony, u &me;, here on earth,blood from a stone etc."
2,Kid's watch!,"This watch is mediocre at best and is really made for those with great eyes-I.E. Kids. Everytime I wanted to change anything such as time or date or mode, I had to carry the instructions with me. Give me an analog watch any day, not this piece of junk!"
4,true classic,"Great watch ,has all the basic features you need , great price too.I use this watch for work at a construction site. The band on it makes it look a little cheap ,but other than that it's great ! If your going to use it for work or some where like a beach or some place casual it's fine, but not great for going out to a nice place or function.All in all it's a great buy !Leo"
4,Excellent for the price,"I forked out about 80 something bucks for that fancy shmancy G-Shock watch but it crapped out on me in about 3 months. Needless to say I was kinda pissed.I needed an everyday sports watch, nothing fancy, just something that could tell the time properly and had a stopwatch. This watch is perfect for that. It's very basic and for a little over ten bucks it's definitely worth it. If you are looking for something with a multitude of unique cool features then look elsewhere."
5,great watch,I was surprised and blessed to find a watch almost exactly like one I had for 20 years and that I really liked and for a great price!
5,Casio's Best,"Casio makes several very similar watches, all of which are very sturdy, none have all of the features of the W-71 though.50M Water Resistance. I've killed watches before because I forgot to take them off before swimming. 50M means you can leave it on while swimming or washing the dishes.Day Date and Month. Lots of watches just give day and date. Yeah I know I ought to be able to remember what month it is, but it's nice to have it right there.A slightly brighter backlight might be nice. I've owned the Indiglo version before, and it's too bright for my taste, it also lacks the Month display."
4,Digital watch,"About 1980 I have purchased a Casio digital watch, I have removed the internal digital timer and inserted it into a custom made cast solid gold case. I can say this was probably the first solid gold digital watch. To make sure the mechanism does not give me problems in time, at the time I have purchased three identical Casio watches as spares. However, due to humidity, after a while some of the digits did not show correctly. In my trips to Singapore and Hong Kong I have found two more identical Casio watches and I have purchased them. Recently none of them were operating properly. So, I was searching the net and I have found this type of digital watch which would fit in my solid gold case. I believe I gave bought 7 watches to have them for a while. This Casio underwater watch is slim, it has dual time, alarm, date, count down and split times, illumination, and the price is acceptable. I do recommend it to anybody."
5,"Nobody will say wow, but ........","I really like this watch. It's very comfortable. It is light and thin. It is the only watch I've had in recent memory that I don't take off when I work.If you want to try to impress people with your cool watch, look elsewhere. If you want a nice watch for yourself, look at this watch or a similar one.Yes, it has a light so you can check the time when it is dark.By the way, this design is more than 20 years old. When you set the year, you can set it as far back as 1985.Hope this helps."
5,Nice watch,"We have liked this style of Casio since 1981. We wish that they still made the 100 meter model that was like this, but this 50 meter version is still pretty good."
4,Great classic Casio digital in a value case and strap.,"The chip and movement are the same as in the most famous classic G-Shock, which is overpriced. This little watch is light, inexpensive, and reliable."
5,Excellent product and service,"I am very pleased with both the watch I bought and the vendor. I have had several watches like this over the past many years. When the watch band breaks, I just go ahead and buy a new watch. Every one works perfecly, exactly like I expect. This is the first time I purchased one online, and the service exceeded my expectations. The product arrived before the promised minimum delivery time. As the title to this review states, this is a clear case of excellent product and excellent service. To all involved, I say ""good job, thanks,"""
5,Great Simple,"Just like the Casio F91W-1 that everyone is probably most familiar with, with really 1 main addition. A timer countdown. There is another main feature: Dual-time (worthwhile if your whole family lives in different time zone than you or say- if you work in LA and NYC frequently). It's basically just another mode that will display another time. Sometimes it can be annoying if you don't realize which mode you're on and you have the wrong time displayed but that's almost a ""user error"".Bottom line- the original F91 was great and this just adds a timer count down. I've owned them both loved them both. Lost them both unfortunately... but buying the W71 again."
5,incredible watch!,"I have two of these watches. The one I am wearing now is over 25 years old! I thought I lost it once so I bought another one about 15 years ago, then found the original. They are both stamped W-71 (without the -1V)on the back so technically they may be a different model, but they look exactly the same. The bands seem to last about 5 to 10 years for me and the plastis face has become a little scratched but the watch just keeps going. All functions work. I love the thin profile. The one that I don't wear is in my memorabilia box and it just keeps running also. I have never even had to change a battery on either of them. They both run slightly fast, they gain maybe a minute per year but that is no problem for me. I think they can be adjusted if you open the back, but I have never done that."
3,"Classic product, poor timepiece","I got this based on all the 5-star reviews, and when it arrived I couldn't understand what all the raves were about. In less than 24 hours, however, I understood completely. The other reviews describe the ways in which this watch is great, so I won't go into it. Personally, I doubt I will ever buy another casual weekend watch. Even if it breaks within a year, I'll just keep buying them, the watch is so inexpensive. I seriously consider this a marvel of modern consumer design, which is probably why it's been in production for so long. So simple and yet so perfect.Update: I have seriously downgraded this product (from 5-stars) after months of use. This is because I have discovered that the timepiece loses two or more seconds per week, which is unacceptable to me. The one thing a watch should do well, is keep time, which this does not do. I had a Timex before this, which wouldn't lose a second in over a year."
5,doxies4me,This is a very nice CD for gentle listening. It is one that can played during the day for bacground with out interfering with activites.
2,Curve Stitching: Art of Beautiful Mathematical Designs,"My search was for Paper Embrodery designs I could use. This is more of a text book explaining how some of the designs are made. The designs are beautiful and I would like to understand all the math that goes into their making. So, unless you are a geometry whiz, I would try some of the other books dedicated to paper embrodery."
4,Out of Print But Valuable,"It's a shame that Ohlschlager's ""Law for the Christian Counselor"" is out of print. An updated version would be timely and helpful for pastors and Christian counselors. This this volume is dated, and therefore with ever-changing legal issues one must be careful, it is still filled with practical wisdom to safeguard a counseling practice.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" ""Soul Physicians"" and ""Spiritual Friends."""
1,Crap,"Fossil watches are just pieces of crap. I dropped mine from a 1-meter height table and the minutes arrow stopped working. What kind of watch is this??? Besides, the strap looks horrible, it seems to be built for Roman-age warriors or something. Definitely a mistake having bought this crap. Not recommended to anyone, even to my enemies."
4,keter,"keter betts was a bassist who was in control,swinging,walking whatever.He didnt get the accolades like the other equally proficient bassists.He played a lot with sam jones while he played cello.bassists do a lot of the work in jazz,"
2,okapi plush,There should've been a much better picture available. When I received the plush it looked more like a fat cow than an Okapi. It has no neck and the striping is wrong. If I could I would go back in time and buy a different one from a different vendor
1,"too hard for little hands, no zipper","I bought this doll for my 2 1/2 year old. Very dissappointed when it arrived, no zipper for practice, only one button on the purse, and it's hard for me to do. It's a cute doll, but not for teaching how to dress."
4,Cute and durable,"The doll is cute and useful, but has no zipper.I was surprised, since that is the important dressing exercise for children's coats. Otherwise, it has enough other learning skills."
4,Use of Emma,I purchased this doll for an occupational therapist to use withyoung children and it is serving that purpose. It teachesthe children to button and snap and tie shoes.
3,Very Cute,This is really cute. I just bought this for my 2 yr old Grandaughter. She loves figuring new things out and this has her curiosity. I'm sure she will be a pro in no time at all
4,"Soft, cuddly & cute",My great-grandaughter was so happy when she opened this. She is to young to utilize all the activities but she can carry it with ease and enjoys hugging her.
2,Beware Disinformation,"Princeton University Press published this book by a Political Science professor at Arizona. It is a psychological study which aims to sort various assassins into several ""types.""While the book has a certain merit when discussing 19th Century political murderers and mandmen, it is full of outright disinformation about the murders of the Kennedy brothers. Oswald never met Sylvia Duran; she was tortured by the CIA and forced to ""confess"" that she had met him. CIA officials such as David Phillips have admitted under oath that the visitor to the Embassy where Ms. Duran worked was NOT Oswald. See Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, University of California Press 1992."
2,Unconvincing Reader,"David Elias reads this, and does not do the writing justice. His portrayal of Inspector Cramer is especially bad. He over-accents Cramer, making him sound like an ignorant lower East Sider, and fans of the genre know Cramer deserves much more than that.The writing, though, is strong, as always. And, though I am not positive about this, I think this audio version is, despite the packaging, an abridgement. Everything is put onto one cassette, which seems like too little time for a complete Wolfe short story. All other collections use two or even two and a half cassettes for the work...Who can tell?"
4,Training Ball,"I found that this training aid had two benefits. The first was that it gave you a very specific point to reference on the cue ball. It makes you realize how big the cue ball really is and gives an aid in fine tuneing your shot. The other thing that I found beneficial was realizing how low you could hit the cue ball to maximize draw. I didn't realize that the cue ball could be struck so low. With a well shaped and chalked cue tip, you can really make the ball return. I would recommend this product. It won't make a good pool game alone; however, it is a good tool if you are willing to invest the time in practicing."
2,Horrible Instruction & Grammar,"I'm not an English teacher or a teacher of any kind for that matter but I can't believe no one has commented on how poorly this instruction book is written. There a number of sentence structure and grammatical errors.Once you get past these errors the basic instruction can be hard to follow and, at times, seems to contradict what was said earlier.By the way, the description tells you that there is over 40 pages of instruction. This is misleading because the book is divided into English and French. You really only get 20 pages of instruction for each language.The ball itself appears to be a high quality made Aramith ball and does provide you with a good visual image to relate to. The ball is the only reason I rated this as 2-stars. The ball by itself deserves better!For a ""Third Edition"" to have so many simple and easily correctable errors is quite embarrassing. If I were Mr. Rempe I would remove my name from this book."
5,Great Training Tool,"This is a fantastic training tool for beginners, intermediate players and even more advanced players. I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn the game."
4,Classic British Brass Band Christmas CD,Really enjoyable CD of what a brass band should sound like at christmas. Nice ensemble work! Already in my A list rotation of Christmas CDs for this and upcoming seasons.
5,indespensable!,This book is chalk full of student-friendly strategies for teaching both self- and peer-revision. I highly recommend it for all teachers of writing.
3,Not as good as what I hoped,I was hoping for a cute story that would tie the music together -- it's a radiothon -- the songs are great -- I thought VeggieTales Live was MUCH better
2,Product description is deceptive,"The description for these straws stated that they were 11 inches. When they arrived, the package said they were 8 inches and indeed they are 8 inches, not the 11 I need them to be. I find this is rather deceptive. 8 inches is too short for my sports bottles. I can buy 8 inch straws lots cheaper at Wal-Mart! I'm greatly disappointed."
1,Flexible straws,"Although the description indicated these were 11"" straws (as best as I could tell from the description), they are actually only 8"" in length. This was a disappointment to me, as I have searched high and low for longer straws that will fit in a water bottle. My mom is crippled with arthritis and unable to easily manage a glass anymore, so she drinks through a straw in a water bottle. The 8"" straws that are readily available are too short. I'd send these back, but it's not worth the cost of postage."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!,"Product Description says they are blue, aqua, and green...WRONG. As previously stated they send you multi-colored straws. That would be fine if I needed multi-colored straws but I don't, I need blue and aqua straws."
1,They Got It ALL WRONG!,"I ordered these straws because they matched my colour scheme and when they arrived, they were all the colours of the rainbow and not what was outlined in the product features. I am very upset. I expect what I pay for.Product Features* Package of 50 colorful and flexible straws* 3 colors: aqua, blue and green* For use with the Progressive straw dispenser"
2,OH Man I do not like this cd.,I only like one song on this cd. . . .The rest I believe are definitly not worth your money.
5,Distorted techno metal to the max!,"This is the most creative music i've ever heard. It's so good, i've played it virtualy every minute of every day since i bought it. (three weeks ago) The music style is so original that i need to play it constantly so i can sing it in my head when i'm not near a CD player. It's heavy heavy rock, yet I find it peaceful enough to sleep with it on. The amazing female vocals surrounded by distorted guitar, and electronic sounds, flow so smoothly into my head that it sounds new everytime i listen. There is no bad song on this CD. Benjamin Gate, give me more!!!!!"
4,not a bad buy,"This is the first I have ever heard of Benjamin Gate, I'm not sure if they had other albums in South Africa or Europe. The cd is good, for the most part. All of the songs are very modern electronic/techno/spacy rock. This band would not be as unique without the female vocels - if they had a male vocalist, I doubt that they would become very popular. There are some sour points though, the lyrics are often repetitive - especially on the choruses. In my opinion, there are a few songs that aren't really that good. I only listen to about half of the songs here; ""How Long"" and ""All Over Me"" are my favorites. They'll probably become singles if they aren't already. My final verdict is that this is about a 3.5 star cd. Buy it if you're a big fan of modern electronic rock."
4,Howling Cub Crop Jigsaw Puzzle 500pc,"Howling cub Crop Jigsaw puzzle 500pcThis puzzle ships all over the world, heavey duty (wood like) sturdy pieces, a little more puzzleing because most of the pieces are closely shaped, very satisfying when compleated. Good colors, good quality puzzle."
3,"Cute, but very basic reading.","This is a darling little book, but the description is very misleading. The age indicated is that it's appropriate for 4-8 year olds. My daughter is 5 and breezed through this in about 2 minutes. I can't imagine that an 8 year old would get ANY enjoyment out of this book! I only gave it three stars for the ""cute factor"". I'd say it would be good for 4 year olds, but no older than that."
1,I don't recommend it,"I don't like to be so negative about a children's book, but I really feel this one has very poor values. Poor Eloise is basically reared by hired help (parents are nowhere in sight). She is defiant and destructive through the whole story, yet gets no consequences at all. Nanny gives her what can only be described as a put-down at the end (""you will never be a cook""), but Eloise is not bothered since her money means she needs no personal skills! Are these the sorts of lessons we want for kids? Though my two year old liked this book, I lost it ""accidentally on purpose""."
5,the funniest must read for every young computer programmer,i read this book after the first year as a programmer and i couldn't put it down. i could pick out myself in the characters and classify most of my other co-workers. it's like a bible to me now and i've read it 3 or 4 times so far. *highly* suggested in my opinion. (ps. hello jed)
4,a geek & proud,"Microserfs was my first Coupland novel and it won't be the last. A simple enough plot ,a story of the extended University campus life spillingout into the computer workplace in a way few careers do. What the author does sowell is to touch on so many latent longings of graduates.....the University digs mentality , Dans relationship with Karla his friendship with Bug his idolisation of the Jedlike Michael are there but also barely mentioned...one of those books you read slowly because you just keep drifting off into that worldof ""i did something like "" and the ""that reminds of the time when""....I loved it..."
5,Coupland's hilarious book gives 90s view of life's meaning.,"While apparently telling us a story of geek programmers and the world of high tech, Douglas Coupland is actually writing about relationships and the search for connectedness. Beneath the laugh-out-loud humor, he explores the nineties view of every decade's concerns -- careers, religion, sexuality, and generational differences -- and reaches the happy conclusion that it's never too late to get a life. It's instructional for parents of gen-x-ers and fun for all. Highly recommended"
5,A wonderful look at the world of technology.,"Even better than ""Generation X"". More than just a window on the world of technology (from someone who's been in it for 30 years), but also a survey of the whole North American culture at the end of the 20th century, which, despite its annoyances, I'm really glad to be part of. A wonderful quirky book"
4,A gripping adventure about the Silicon Valley cyber culture,"Once I started this book, it was hard to pull away. Coupland pulls you into the book not by just introducing us to the characters but making us care for the characters as if we actually knew them. The end of this book leaves you shocked at what you have just experienced, a first person view of the Silicon Valley cyber culture."
2,Intelligence in a spin of cynicism,"Douglas Coupland is a very intelligent guy, but his writing seems to focus solely on the hardships and difficulties of the younger generation he has crossed with an X. Microserfs is no different. While it includes many apt insights about our current technologised society, it is a one-sided account which igonores any kind of resolution or positive direction of that society. In other words, the novel is stuck in the-life's not fair supplication which, inevitably has no reward except to lead to a redundant and circular chase of our own tails. Quite frankly, it wears thin after a while, which is not to say that Coupland will not produce something of better quality in the future, its just saying that his present, while appropriate to his creative development, is a repetitive whine."
4,For Geeks and non Geeks alike....,"Sitting in the office late on a saturday night, writing code, with a copy of this book by my side: how to get yourself a life in the Computer industry. Excellent - there is some hope for geeks, not just that they can and do have a real life, but also that other people will see them in a different light. A book that everyone who uses a computer should read before they slag off their software..."
4,Great book!,"This book is required reading at the office, so it's been high on my list for a while. I wish I'd gotten to it sooner, as it's one of the funnier books I've read in recent times. Although written in 1995, it ironically reads like a blog due to the diary-like chapter structure in which the main character pours out his thoughts in a stunted, almost anecdotal fashion.The characters found throughout are truly hilarious, probably because they hearken so close to the environment we face in the technology industry. Recommended reading, particularly if you regularly interact with an IT staff."
1,boring and whiny,"I can't stand this Coupland guy, this stupid excuse for a writer has delivered one of the whiniest books about generation X that I have ever read. It seems that all his characters do is worry and bitch and pretend that everything was perfect in the 50's and 60's, and all this generation can do is sit around, whine and maybe if their lucky, find their inner child. Oh and another thing, don't worry about having to have extensive technical knowledge to read this book, Coupland seems to only know three computer terms: C++, OOP, and internet, everything else is just a bunch of psychobabble/sociology B.S."
1,A better decomposer than entertainment,I ripped the covers off of this book and through it out the window. That just about sums up my opinion.
1,the delivery was too long,"The delivery was very far away from the purchase, the book is very geek and funny"
1,Nothing To Do With Hi-Tech,"This book is just a soap-opera that has nothing to do with the supposed setting and characters of the book. I had a hard time doing it, but I read the whole book just to see if it did actually ever get into anything to do with the things it talks about on the cover or in the first couple of pages; it doesn't. The clown author just wrote a book about clueless/lifeless characters and gave them jobs in hi-tech to attract an audience. The soap-opera story isn't even original (in fact, it reminds me of Danielle Steele's work). The author continuously reveals his lack of knowledge of the hi-tech industry in the few mentions he gives the subject. If you bought this book, I feel sorry for you. I received it as a gift and had a hard time not telling the person how little I appreciated it."
2,Please don't read this,"What a terrible book. It's slow and mostly pointless at times. Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space. That is the premise of this book. I went into this book thinking:1. This a great author!2. All the characters are about my age!3. I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge!4. My friends and I are all computer nerds. This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!I was wrong on all counts. There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to. It lacks an interesting plot. It lacks characters the reader can enjoy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book. Go. Read ANYTHING else."
3,Geekiness == Goodness,"I read this book while I was studying on the island of Crete off the coast of Greece -- a time when I was going into serious technology-withdrawl. It was a heaven-sent bit of humor. The random thoughts pages with references to old school ""coolness"" such as Electronic Arts, Commodore 64s, Atari 2600s, etc. were fun flashbacks.I was, however, disappointed with the way the book moves away from geekiness into gooey, lovey-dovey, ""life is grand"" thoughts towards the end."
1,Fluff and Frivolous,"Coupland's style has never really impressed me much. But, I always given someone a second chance.Contrary to many critics, Coupland reliance, or better yet - dependence, on popular culture is not symbolic or metaphoric of a generation. Instead, Coupland style dripples from one stereotyped flat character to another with little or no substance. His lack of any creative flavor puts Microseft right up there with an E! Entertainment programming.Coupland failed to even study accurate basics of the individual cultures that are supposively present in his characters. Most of his settings are sophmoric and naive, like someone who wrote this book from reading generalized Wired magazines about nerds and Microsoft.In the end he tries to push all of these broken elements together in order to have his poorly construed characters obtain enlightenment.It is amazing what they will publish today. I would not recommend this book to anyone I like."
5,The LEGO Inside,"Coupland's novel will appeal to the 21st Century geeks as much as it was written about the geeks of the '90s. Anyone who is educated in science and engineering and has had his or her hard-won talents twisted by corporations into slavish poorly compensated labor and the bottom line of company profit will immediately recognize the plight of Coupland's characters. However, Coupland's obvious love of LEGO and belief in the ingenuity and creativity of young geeks give hope for family relationships and the power of friendship in an otherwise digitally meaningless world."
4,"So close to perfect, yet so far away","Amazingly amusing throughout 99% of the pages, the ending serves to send the book tumbling down to an 8, being worse than predictable. Apart from this, Microserfs is a well-written, postmodern view at a world obsessed with computerized relationships. The fragments from the main characters' database of thoughts sends the reader reeling into strange rows of associations and adds a dimension of openess and awareness to the book that would have been impossible to express otherwise. These fragments are the counterparts of the small narratives in Generation X, but possess a freedom and life of their own that makes them genuinely unique.Having seen Douglas Coupland live, I am also pleased (and relieved) to find once again that he is much more coherent on paper than in person."
2,Wonderful book - Horrible conversion to ebook.,"This is quite possibly my favorite novel. The story, setting and characters are wonderful. If you like technology and how it intersects with our day-to-day interactions with the people in our lives you will really enjoy Microserfs. It also helps if you have any nostalgia for the 90s.With that said, this is a terrible e-book. Was there an editor or someone to proofread the final version? It looks like someone just scanned the book and relied on the computer's optical character recognition (OCR) to get everything right. As others have noted - the book is full of U's being mistaken for V's and other errors like this. It's just lazy editing.5 starts for the story; 2 Stars just for the crappy e-book."
3,Too Much License,"I was given this book because I am a programmer. Unfortunately, that is keeping me from totally enjoying it. Coupland gets many of the details of programmers lives correct, the crucial exception being when he actually attempts to write about programming. The fictional product the characters are working on simply could not exist, especially during the era in which the story is set. A small detail maybe, but enough of an annoyance to ruin the suspension of disbelief necessary for stories to work.As a result, if you're thinking of buying this book for a programmer, I suggest you look at some O'Reilly titles instead."
2,"cout << ""And I thought my life was boring!"" << endl;","""You know what? This is a *really* nerdy book!! If this book was a man, he'd be wearing a checkered shirt, taped glasses, and unkempt hair. If this book was a woman, she'd be wearing a messy bun on her head and complaining about sinuses while downing a bottle of orange Triaminic. Oh man... Lots of computer jargon and ""inside"" jokes.""Unless you're a computer whiz who gets his/her hee-haws from laughing at people who don't know all the cool acronyms and neat-o chat signs :p, pass on this one. IMHO. I wish I had. Could have spent my $ on a nifty pocket protector instead. LOL. ;)"
4,"Pretty Good, Not Great","This book had a lot of funny and interesting parts in it. Unfortunately, it didn't really have much in the way of plot. While reading this, I kept expecting something big to happen but it never did. The book goes along in the same manner from beginning to end with little to no plot twists or turns..."
4,Bill binds us all,"For all the secret admirers of Bill this is a must read book. The story of a Microsoft programmer on the Microsoft campus is great stuff and really funny too. It tells about the culture within the company at the beginning of the nineties. Those were the days a lot of the older employees vested their stocks and became miljonair over night. Unfortunately the main character in Microserfs is not one of those. But he doesn't really care, I guess he just likes his work. This changes when he gets a girlfriend. Then he likes his work and also something else. What binds the characters on the campus is not their work but the unconditional worship of their hero Bill. All in all Microserfs is a true product of the nineties and computer people really should try it."
4,Quite a Touching and Realistic Portrayal,"I found this book to be interesting and touching. The only things that bothered me were the gibberish regarding pretentious politics (Dusty, Todd, and Ethan), and the character of Amy. Also I wished Doug Coupland dove more into Oop! development. But I guess no one can be perfect!"
5,You won't understand this book if you're over 40,"If you were born between 1967-1972 & are employed in any technology sector, then read this book! I promise you'll get all the refs to the 70s & 80s arcane knowledge that flies over the heads of Boomers at 30,000 feet -per the usual- What DOESN'T go way over their heads, anyway?- I found the story to be amusing and entertaining & otherwise worthy of my attention."
2,Kindle Edition badly in need of editing/proofreading.,"This would easily be a 4 star book for me and in paperback I'd give it that in a heartbeat but the Kindle edition is horrible. It seems like someone ran a hardcopy through a scanner and then OCR'ed it without proofreading it at all. There are letters missing, a few entire words missing and many, many instances of the wrong letter over and over (like a U instead of a V - there's an entire section where it says Silicon Ualley over and over) and places where the wrong word was picked up (ie - Interiority becomes Inferiority, somewhat appropriate in describing this edition).I've read the book before and enjoyed it but the Kindle edition was a bit of a chore. It looks like the publisher didn't even proofread this book once before uploading it. A shame, really."
1,Kindle version is a mess,"When I spend ten bucks on a digital copy of a book, I assume it's going to be free of sloppy OCR errors and will be proofread. This is not. It is a mess, and chapters near the end are almost unreadable. This is at the quality level of a pirated ebook that some teenager scanned. I want be buying any ebook titles from Harper again, this is just appalling."
4,"Really cool fiction, but very accurate","I was still a relative newcomer in the field of software development, when I bought this book. I had always wanted to learn more about the experience of other programmers, and the author did wonderful job of sharing their stories with us. The book really dives in the human side of being a part of a company on the edge of technology. It's really about the *lifestyle* of being a programmer in the nineties, by letting us peer through the eyes of his characters in their day-to-day lives."
2,Interesting but too fluffy,"I've heard lots of geeks enthusiastically recommend this book, but I found it entirely lacking in meaningful content. Additionally, the characters' traits were overdone combinations of all the worst, most extreme characteristics of many ""geeks."" Basically, too much fluff and not enough content."
2,Like Seinfeld a book about nothing.,The story was developed painfully slow. The subject matter was insightful but dull. The charecters were unappealing and the ending was unsatisfying.
2,"Shiny cover, empty pages","While the idea was cute, I really had a tough time with this book.First off, there's no real plot to speak of --just various unlikeable characters making whiny pop-culture references at each other for 200 pages. The page count is padded out with a few randomly-inserted pages of Coupland himself making random commentary about his personal fetishes in random-size fonts. Finally, the entire mess culminates in the astounding revelation that Legos are cool.This one gets two stars because the concept is sound and the picture on the back cover of the author fondling a phallic-looking Lego plane was unintentionally funny.I just hope that someday a better author can do the concept justice."
4,Very good selection of good and great blues musicians,"This is an excellent sampling of many well-known and some not-so-well-known musicians from the recent past. Good listening, good selection."
4,alligator blues,"I ordered alligator records 25th, 30th,and 40th anniversary c.d.'s and have really enjoyed all so them. These copies are not easy to find in a music store so I always check with amazon on hard to get items. The c.d.'s have 18 to 20 different artist,some have passed away, on each c.d. ,so it's a really good deal. All the artist are well known in the blues field, and I would recommend any or all of the above anniversary editions."
3,Very best?,"I heard a Lou Rawls song on the radio recently, and I remembered how much I liked him way-back-when. I had a couple of his cassettes that are now long gone. The recording quality of the CD is good, but not great. Some of the songs I was looking for are here, but many are not. I guess some of my favorites were buried deep in his albums, and are not considered the ""very best."""
3,my review,most of the songs were not the one Lou Rawls was famous to singing- there were too many jazz songs- I would prefer to hear a cd where lou rawls sang love songs.
2,Fairly satisfied,"I did get the two songs I wanted on the CD, but am a little dissapointed in the other songs since I had not heard a lot of them. Fairly satisfied. Thanks"
2,Not what I expected,"I probably should have looked closer at the playlist on this CD. Instead, I just went by the title, ""The Very Best of Lou Rawls."" I've never heard of most of the songs on the CD, and I don't think the sound quality is up to par."
5,"Second Hercules stand, probably not the last","I bought this single stand for my daughter's new acoustic guitar. I already own the 3 guitar model of this stand. The quality is the same as my other stand, top notch.These stands are stable, beefy, and hold your instruments gently and securely. You'll have a hard time finding something that will make you feel this secure about storing your guitars.I'm sure I'll be buying more of these as my collection grows."
5,Overdue reissue,"I've yet to make it through the entire set of CDs here, but having grown up on this particular orchestration of Die Kunst Der Fuge, the box is worth it just for this reissue. For those who know or own the original Nonesuch 4xLP, be aware that this transfer is wonderfully clean but certain overtones gain emphasis you might not have heard on the vinyl. Nevertheless, the breathtaking silence at the end of the final fugue, which trails off at the point Bach reached before his death, is more haunting in this version than on the original vinyl."
5,Fantastic set,"Excellent performances of all of Bach's orchestral works, and an amazing version of The Art of Fugue. Excellent version of the Brandenburgs as well. Definitely a good purchase."
5,Brandenburgs in Stereo on Mine,"I bought this despite the review that indicated Brandenburgs were in mono. Happily my copy had them in stereo. This is the best set of Brandenburgs that I have ever heard, I originally had them on LP on nonesuch and also on CD on Accord import. The box I got was ""465 893 2""."
5,Finest Art Of Fugue,"No doubt for past 40 yrs, recoreded early 1960's. Ristenpart far surpasses any other recording with his all star chamber group.That said, I rarely if ever listen to the Art Of Fugue. I mean its OK, but when you compare Art Of Fugue to most all of Mozart, AoF comes across as boring and monotonous.And as for the Brandenburg Concertos, i've never cared for any of them in 30 yrs. I mean bach was great until you discover other composers like Schonberg, Berg, Pettersson, Schnittke , Elliott carter.Why pretend Bach is still a interesting composer?Why?Just because he was one of *the pillars of our faith*?Thats stinking dogma and doctrine.Move on man, move on.Bach and Vivaldi were reborn in Mozart but ina much superior form.Great recording, boring music after a few listens.."
3,Cannot grate/process like other flavors,"I have been using Natural Balance food rolls for over a year as a food topper. I found that the most convenient way to distribute the topper so that it mixes evenly with the kibble (and makes the whole dish taste better) is by putting it in a food processor and grating it small bits. We call them the dogs' ""sprinkles.""I had not tried the beef flavor yet and thought the dogs would appreciate a change of pace. Unfortunately our routine is out of whack now. When put into a food processor and ground, this food roll turns into a paste and sticks to itself, basically turning into a solid again. We cannot just ""sprinkle"" it on top of food. Although I like the Natural Balance products, if you plan on grinding down the roll- don't get this flavor!"
5,Our Lhasa loves the beef dog food roll!,"In addition to the freeze dried dog nuggets, I supplement with cut-up portions of various flavors of the dog food rolls and the beef is Callie's favorite. It is moist, easy to cut into 1-inch or 2-inch slices before storing in refrigerator or freezer for short or long-term. It is a complete dog food that can be used alone, as a supplement, or as a treat. So happy Amazon offers a great variety of pet food at reasonable prices. It was packaged well and arrived within two days after I placed my order."
3,Dogs really like it,My dogs really like this stuff. But it's really not the healthiest. I use at as a treat every once in a while.
5,Beef Roll is beautiful,"Both my dogs go crazy over this. I originally bought it for treats but one of my dogs has decided she is not going to open her mouth for any reason whatsoever unless this is mixed in or is her treat. I have made a monster.Truthfully, I am happy this inspires her to eat. She has been a fussy eater since I have had her. It has not been unusual for her to go a day and a half without eating. However with this I know she will eat. I just crumble some in her breakfast and dinner bowl and she will slurp it right up.For lunch she gets 1/4 cup of kibble and a half slice of this which I crumble up and put in her Bob-A-Lot toy by Starmark. In no time it is gone.I love this stuff!"
3,Leaves Much to be Desired,"The HP Officejet Pro L7650 all in one has been a pretty big disappointment. It's huge and looks sturdy and has a lot of features, but performance and ease of use are lacking. It has a hit or miss interface with Windows Vista on my computer. Not always does it connect when trying to scan or use any other interface with the computer. When using the feeder to fax or scan, it often grabs more than one page at a time, resulting in paper jams. Every time I try to print an envelope it messes us and the envelope gets jammed. It takes a good 1-2 minutes to boot up and go through its warm up process. And finally, a pet peeve - it gives you an annoying ""cartridge low"" warning about 2 months before it runs out. You can't disable it and it shows up both on your computer and on the printer every time it starts up. HP trying to get you to buy and replace the cartridge before you need to. All in all, this unit has been a disappointment."
2,L7650 - ADF is Garbage,"Have had this unit for 2 years. Like amy others the automatic document feeder has broken and techsupport is no help. The copies and faxes all come out slightly out of focus. As a networkable printer it is fine, but if you want a decent fax machine, don't get this unit."
2,ADF Document scanner prone to break downs,"Don't buy if you plan on scanning documents. The (ADF) automatic document feeder failed after scanning less than 25 sheets. Tried cleaning rollers etc. contacted tech support no help, no repair documentation available and customers unable to buy spare parts. Poor design, cheaply made. The rest of printer ok. Would not buy again.If you buy get insurance as you will need to get a replacement if it fails like mine did."
1,WORST PRINTER AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER,"I could easily put in CT Ann's review in here as her experience duplicated mine, although I quit after only three replacements instead of four. GREAT features -- when they work -- but clearly HP is selling a schlocky product so we will buy tons of expensive ink. For the time I have spent troubleshooting these units I could have bought the nicest printer out there, which I will this time. Like she said, if I could do no stars, I would."
1,More about author's self promotion than any real self help,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read several books on hypnosis and self hypnosis and some have been very helpful. The main thing about this book that really bothered me is that it kept selling (er, referring to) the author's wonderful and unique ""Sidman Solution"". Since several of the other hypnosis books I have read refer to the exact same thing as ""age regression"" I guess coming up with a catchy name and calling it your own may be a great marketing tool for the author. I just wish the book had really had some new and useful information and wasn't obviously written as an ego thing for the author. I am not sure where all the glowing reviews came from, but I can guess since all the five star reviews only reviewed this book and nothing else. All I can tell you from my experience is there are far better books out there that will give you better information with much less hype."
1,Instant Disappointment,"Frankly, I am amazed that all the shills, ooops, I mean past reviewers gave this book five stars considering it does not deliver one single technique for achieving ""instant inner peace"". All it talks about is the Sidman Solution (trademarked why?) in vague terms - more than half the book is full of testimonials or cases of alleged patients who do not disclose their identities, including one cancer case (red flag!). This book is a crass promotional piece for Sidman's hypnotherapy practice, where she charges almost $800 a session! There are lots of good, reputable hypnotherapists who charge reasonable rates w/o the hype."
1,"200 page commercial for ""The Sidman Solution"".","Mostly case studies. Patient has these problems. After the first session of the ""Sidman Solution"" this gets better, second session that gets better, third session something else is fixed.The only action one can take is to go to the office and pay for the therapy. I'd suggest: ""You Can Be Happy, No Matter What by Richard Carlson or Wayne Dyer's ""Your Erroneous Zones"" or ""The Sky's the Limit""."
5,A must read!,"I thought Dr. Sidman's book gives hope that seemingly unsolvable or incurable problems CAN be solved through the power of the subconscious mind. I have encountered hypnotherapists before, of all types. Dr. Sidman is by far one of the most insightful, compassionate, and intelligent people in her field, and I believe The Sidman Method she outlines in her book is one of the most powerful and well developed of all forms of hypnosis I have ever encountered. I just can't say enough about it. In fact, I am quite jealous I don't live in southern california, because the book makes me want to have a hypnotherapy session with her. Those of you who live close enough to actually visit this amazing woman are very lucky. I predict we will hear a lot more from Dr. Sidman in the near future."
3,Mostly for modelers,"For modelers, this book is a great source on all details about the not-much-written-about turkish army. As usual, it has plenty of black and white photos as well as eight center color plates, with complete explanations at the end.For a little bit more of history on the Turkish army, I'd suggest adding another Osprey book: GALLIPOLI 1915."
2,"Good concept, but not interesting to read","I recieved the book quickly, but was not impressed with the book itself. I struggled being interested in it and I was not able to finish it because of this."
2,Bambu Cutting Board,"This is so tiny that it's just about useless. I love bambu cutting boards, but this one should go back to the drawing board. I was looking for something lightweight and that could be rinsed off and set to dry in the drainer without too much effort. The board is lightweight, and dries fast, but is way overpriced, and that makes me angry."
3,Not what expected,They're small but sturdy. They great in my toaster oven. I used them to make venison jerky. They are sturdy enough to use as trivets.
5,Perfect bread cooling racks,"These are just the right size to cool down a loaf of bread. I have had them almost a year and they look brand new. As cooling racks, I am very happy with this product and would recommend it."
3,Cheap--but you knew that already,"Sometimes a cheap product that has only one job to do is just fine. All these little guys need to do is withstand my oven's temperatures and stay in one piece. Mission accomplished!The other reviewers are right, these are somewhat poorly constructed. Be careful when washing or rubbing your hands over them (for whatever reason you might do that); there are lots of little metal edges that can catch. But my raw chicken breast doesn't know the difference!These are a fine economical product that does what they advertise."
2,quarter sheet size - not that I can tell,"I will just state that I am very disappointed in these racks for one reason, they are way smaller than the quarter sheet pans we ordered. the way these fit, I am amazed they do not say they will fit half sheet pans as well, the same as my size 11 feet can also fit in size 13 boots. I can go for a reasonable gap to accommodate pans from different manufactures, say a quarter inch all around. this is like a half on the long side and an inch on each end. pathetic."
2,smaller than small,"Silly me, when I ordered a half size rack and a half size baking sheet, I expected them to be similar in size. This rack is half the half size sheet pan, and of marginal utility. At least I'll have a cooling rack for the next time the gnomes, elves, and munchkins drop in for baked goods."
1,Too Small Grate,The size description is smaller than stated and the company did not respond to my request for a return authorization number (3 requests). I will not buy from this company again.
1,cooling rack,"I ordered this rack with the 1/2 size sheet pan. It was listed as 1/2 restaurant cooling rack when in reality it is 1/4 not 1/2 as listed. Very poor listing. Someone is not doing their homework.I would give this item a zero rating, but that was not available."
5,good product,It fills many needs. As stated in the description it is heavy duty commercial grade. Not the usual cheap crap that is being thrown at us. You get what you pay for and this product is substantial.
4,High Quality,You can feel the quality in these racks as you lift them from the delivery package. I like having the option of using one or both together. I haven't seen any this nice in stores and am glad I took a chance on Amazon.
5,Boys love them,My boyfriend loves these for his smoker and everything that he does with them. Great buy for all the uses that he does for them
1,"Very poor quality, workmanship","I was really looking forward to receiving this product and was very pleased that it arrived, well packaged and on time. HOWEVER, when I opened the items and removed them from the packaging, the quality did not meet my expectations at all. The joining between the rack and one of the leg pieces was completely broken away. This appears to be a manfacturing flaw as it was identical on both racks. I am returning the item for refund. My expectation would be that something purported to be ""Commercial grade"" would be well made and sturdy. This was a real disappointment."
5,PERFECT!,"these cooling racks are perfect, i purchased them so i can bake oven fried fish and over fried chicken! they are small, but just order 2 of them, thats what i did and i can fit a whole cut up chicken on 2 of them! they are worth the money. sturdy and easy to clean! i think im going to order 2 more just for the heck of it!"
1,not as represented,"be advised that the this pan grate is not a companion to the half size heavy duty sheet pan. the sheet pan is more than double the size of this little cheap grate. there are no dimensions noted - only weight, and even that is overstated. this little thing does not weigh 12 oz. once it is out of the box. i give it no stars - i just couldn't submit the review without indicating a star rating."
4,Gets the job done.,"Overall, I'm happy with these racks. I can fit two in a standard baking sheet and I use them mostly to cook bacon in the oven. They stack/store well. They were harder to clean than expected. Cooked bits really cling to the corners."
3,They Work,I wanted racks to use in the oven for bacon and these work - I will keep looking for a size that fits my pan so I can buy just a single rack instead of having to use two.
4,Relentless,This is the second Harris book I've read. I enjoy her attention to detail and the storyline. She has created wonderful people as her characters. It seems that she knows them like family. I read for entertainment and like books that are stories with great endings. Harris will be an author I'll look for.
5,Fast paced and full of action,"Harris' investigation team is well trained and know how to find their criminal. Harris has created well defined characters that she writes about in all her books - you get to know them. I like the story line that mixes police, murder and personal relationships. Her writing is pleasant without gross vocabulary."
4,Wall Street Ventures & Adventures Thru 40 Years,"Good read. Book is a biography of Richard Wyckoff's work history. It is full of concepts that all master traders acquire reguardless of the time period. He givesexamples of how to identify what ""composite operators"" are doing so one can trade in harmony with them.Book adds completeness if you have read ""Studies in Tape Reading"" and ""How I Trade and Invest in Stocks and Bonds"""
3,Asterix and Obelix Hunt go prospecting!,"Albert Uderzo, Asterix and the Black Gold (Dargaud, 1981)Ekonomikrisis the merchant has landed at the indomitable Gaulish village, but he's fresh out of rock oil, which Getafix needs to make his magic potion. Asterix and Obelix to another globe-trotting rescue! This time the pair are headed for Mesopotamia, along with the help of Roman-Agent-disguised-as-a-druid Dubbelosix (who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Sean Connery. These artists are crazy!). There's a great deal of Biblical messing-about, some James Bond punnery, and a good time is had by all (save, of course, the Romans). ***"
4,Adorable Book,"First and foremost, it should be noted that a single guinea pig does not belong in a classroom unless he goes home every evening with a responsible adult owner. This alone is the reason I gave it four out of five stars. Guinea pigs are social, loving animals who are very good with children. They require care multiple times a day and should never be left alone all weekend.That said, what a wonderful little book. I recently took it and my son's guinea pigs into his kindergarten class to read to the kids and they really enjoyed it. The illustrations are so lifelike and the book gives kids the facts on guinea pig care. The noises that Sammy makes are spot-on. It's an absolutely sweet little book that my kids just love. Highly recommend to kids and guinea pig-lovers."
1,Horrible reel,"This reel sucks , after a litle while is useless , this could be use for fresh water but not saltwater does not last long"
1,Terrible!!!,"THIS REEL IS CHEAP. NO LINE FILLED SPOOL AS INDICATED. THIS REEL IS UNNECESSARILY HUGE. FEELS LIKE IT WILL LAST MAYBE ONE TRIP. I GOT SUCKERED, DON'T YOU! AMAZON WON'T ALLOW COMMENTS ON THIS SELLER! THAT IS A SHAME. JUST MY TWO CENTS..."
5,THIS RECORDING IS THE BEST!!!!!!!,"I love this recording so much.I love and respect Jackie so much.When you want to listen to her music,LISTEN THIS!!!!!!! THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!! ****************************************** In this,you can feel her life.Great,wonderful,and sad...!NOW LISTEN THIS!!!!!!!Then you can meet the great cellist,Jacqueline Du Pre!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but not du Pré","I've heard far better recordings of Jackie and the Elgar concerto. This recording was okay, but it's kind of a forshadow of Jackie's MS. It was good, but not that great. Jackie has a wide vibrato, way too many glissandos, and a wavering tone here and there. It's very difficult to follow Jackie because she's slowing the tempo quite frequently. The Enigma variations were awesome, of course. The essence of Daniel Barenboim is all over here. I listen to that sometimes when I go to bed. But if you want a great recording of the Elgar concerto, pick up ""Lasting Impressions"" or ""Hilary and Jackie"" soundtrack. Jackie's Elgar concerto does sound far better on those albums."
4,Very Precise,This book is well written and precise. This is especially suitable for anyone studying marketing and moreso international marketing. There are alot of case studies and definitions. I will highly recommend the product.
4,Int'l Marketing & export Management,"This is a well written book. It explains all the ends and outs of exporting. I would have given book 5*, but I don't like to read, and you have to read a lot in this book. End of chapter exercises are really good."
5,"Thank You, Thank You, & Thank You !!!","After reading this book, I asked myself why I should ever read any other book to help me realize my dreams. This book should be called 'The A-Z Guide To Manifesting Your Dreams In Any Area of Life' It has it all - It's super-charged! And once again, THANKS to the author, Dr. Adrian Calabrese."
4,a lot of info,"This was a very good book with lots of information although I did feel the chapters were kind of disorganized. The author clearly knows a lot on the area of metaphysics and she gives lots of info in how to manifest your dreams into reality. This was my first book about self help and after reading this, it has triggered to be go out and find out more on improving my life for the better. Overall, this is a good book and I hope to see her next book come out soon."
5,Brilliant!,"What a fantastic uplifting album. A group that was introduced to me by Amazon and I thank them for introducing me to this amazing pop christian group. Filled with uplifting uptempo tracks like the fantastic opening song Wonder Why and the gorgous inspirational ballad Come and Fill My Heart this proves to be one of the best christian pop albums ever...if not one of the best albums ever. All 4 members have wonderful voices and all harmonies are very tight, and the production is fantastic, focusing on the vocals. Each song has a special meaning and each is sung beautifully from the heart. Other highlights are The Best Thing, Undeniably You, The Glory, and Love Remains. All ages will adore this album and hopefully Avalon will be around for a while. It's nice to have a group singing fantastic songs with their focus on God instead of sex."
2,Boring,It's well-produced and has a couple of good songs but it gets tedious and a whole CD of it is more than anybody needs to hear.
5,Another Job Well Done!!,"I now own all four of Avalon's non-holiday albums, and I can honestly say they have never disappointed me. One thing I like about their music is that you never get ""the same old, same old"" Each of their releases seems different from the previous. This one has just the right mix of upbeat and ballads, though a couple of the ballads, in my opinion, drag just a bit (My music tastes are more on the upbeat side). But I can honestly say I do like every song here. While reading some of these reviews, however, I was surprised that many think they're drifting into the pop scene. The first time I listened to this I didn't get that message at all, it was very clear who they're singing these songs to. You don't have to mention God in every sentence to get your message across. I highly recommend this album, I think this group is showing incredible improvement each time."
5,i love this!,"this cd was wonderful--avalon is now officially my favorite band. the songs are great, and the music is fantastic. i don't know how to describe it. my favorites are definitely wonder why, undeniably you, and the glory. i didn't expect too much at first, as i've only started getting into christian music, but avalon proved me wrong, hands down. you've got to get this!"
4,Very Uplifting,"If the last song on this CD doesn't give you chill bumps, then something must be wrong. I love the entire CD, but the last song is the one I'm drawn to the most. I play it all the time!"
4,A pleasure in a book,"Bawdy words every adult use but few know their origin and background. Loved the detail and history lesson that proves we're not the most pornographic generation, just the next one. Censors have wasted their entire lives to control a basic human curiosity and function. Better this book were part of standard English courses than banned by hopeless prudes!"
3,Came without the white gasket that seals the nut to the door jamb,"I ordered two from Amazon. One came with the white gasket, the other came without it. Now I have to go find one. Mechanically, these switches work just fine."
5,"Great story, well-told","I loved this book. The story is unbelievable, and Cynthia Herrup does a great job of explaining all its ins-and-outs (no pun intended). If you want a novel, this ain't it. But if you want a great history book, this is for you. Me? I'm giving it to all my friends . . . and maybe my mom too!"
4,Perfect for our needs to show movie at church,The screen was easy to set-up and the perfect size for movie night at our church. Good quality screen for the price.
5,DVD,I bought this DVD as a gift for 5 year old boy.To my knowledge he loves to watch this movie.Thad M.
5,Best scent if you want compliment from women.,"I used this before all the time, & women would always compliment me on it. They would be like ""oh my god, what are you wearing?"" or ""you smell so good"" nice compliments like that. It's a refreshing smell. That's why I decided to buy it again. Great product. Buy it you'll definitely get compliments from women."
2,Ok for my dog,"I don't know why I bought this musk. Maybe I thought it was like some kind of pheromone potion that would drive my wife wild. Well it's just way too strong, like all masks. I use it to deodorize my dog, but it is like torture"
2,Pretty pictures,I thought this was more of a project book...but it is mainly for showing different linens.For the person wanting to see different linens it would be great.
1,Awful!,"This was a big waste of money, both for the product itself and because it ruined an entire pan of lasagne. The noodles were no-boil (which generally I'm not a big fan of because they are still tough), but the convenience was great. After baking the lasagne at 375 for one hour, the noodles were still very tough, yet at the same time they absolutely crumbled apart in your mouth and didn't act at all like a typical lasagne noodle. Out of our family of four, only my husband was able to finish his serving, but he even admitted that he didn't like it."
2,GF Lasagna not as firm as typical pasta,I make lasagna for our annual family gathering so I was excited that I found a GF lasagna noodle so I could eat the same dish as the family. I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time.
2,Way too fast-paced for me,"and I am no beginner! Instead of getting a workout, I was worn out just trying to keep up with the girl doing the ""beginner"" routine (and if you think that consitutes a workout...!!!) I found this video more frustrating than anything else. I love Gin Miller's instruction but it's not enough to save this video. The camera switched angles way too many times, even at times focusing solely on the musicians!! I don't recommend this one, if you want a step video that's paced correctly where you can actually feel your muscles working, try Karen Voight's Lean Legs & Buns."
3,"it may grow on me, but....","i've had this video for more than four months and i've only used it two times. part of the reason is the quick cycles, combining cardio step with lifting wieghts. it just feels unsmooth to me. after starting to sweat to the step moves and getting into a rhythm with them, they are ended abrubtly for a series of lifting exercises. it felt unhealthy to me - the stopping and starting."
5,"Rock hard legs, arms, and butt",This workout gets everything you need in less than an hour. Perfect for the busy person. Gin Miller is an excellent motivator. It go me in shape!!
4,A GREAT OVERALL WORKOUT!!,"This video gives the body a really great workout!! Sometimes the step moves were a bit confusing, but that doesn't happen often. Rotating between stepping and toning exercises is great because it gives the body a chance to rest from the cardio routines, while giving you a chance to tone your muscles. I didn't use the tubing. Instead, I used hand weights, which I personally like better since you can always change how much weight you use. This video is definitely a great addition to any workout routine!!"
2,not for everyone,This book did not meet my expectactions- I found it very pretentious and hard to tolerate.
5,Not Dreamland or 23 AM . . . but Fantastic!!!,This album is not like his previous releases at all.Anyone who rates this as subpar is a moron.From beginning to end it is a jam ranging from subdued to downright scary.this is not cheesy trance!!!If you bought it and put it down because it isn't Dreamland II I urge you to pick it up again. . . put on some headphones and turn out the lights.
2,this is purecheezy,"I'm a big fan of ""techno"" and electronica in general, so I'm open to lots of styles, but I really expected better from this work, especially given the star-studded cast of characters helping out. While he has a bent for the melodramatic in other albums that I can deal with, this is darkly cheezy, like the music for a bad vampire movie, or an evil porno. I'm pretty disappointed in this one. The wailing electric guitars are too much, and the whole thing doesn't even come together. I'll give it more time, but I still think you'd be best to download this one from GNUtella or Napster."
2,Musicians who take themselves too seriously,"This is a good example of what happens when a musician who, flushed with earlier success, starts to regard himself as a grande artiste and forgets that his job is primarily to entertain audiences. Apart from a few half-good pieces up the front, the rest of the CD is pretty much pretentious twaddle that you'll never want to listen to again after one hearing. The A&R person who let this slip thru needs a good swift kick up the backside. The sales will be appalling and I hope Mr Miles learns his lesson. A costly disappointment."
5,A mastermind ahead of his time!,I think that Robert with Organik really proved and showed his talent as a producer. this CD could be the guide in music for future generations. and i don't know why people are giving Robert Miles 1 star for this CD just because it wasn't what they expected. they should just appreciate and realize what a masterpiece this production is and how much talent Robert Miles has. But of course you could only realize that if you are educated and have some real knowldge of music and electronic music.
2,Not what i was expecting,I bought this CD because it's from Robert Miles. I guess I should have listened to it first I didn't really like it it's too hard for me I am used to soft music like his last two CDs this is more like headbanging hard rock stuff I do not like.
2,Maybe it'll grow on me...,"I just bought this CD yesterday, and thus far am not overly impressed. It could be that I'm just not into the style...This CD is unlike RM's previous two CDs. The style (in my mind at least) has more of an Eastern mixed with African flavour to it. Sort of similar to Evan Chen. (Of Crusade fame, for those not familiar with him.)I'm not willing to say that this CD is garbage. It's not. But if you are a fan of RM's previous two CDs, I would seriously consider listening to a few tracks before buying Organik. It is nothing like them."
1,Uninspired doodling,"Robert Miles ditches the dreamscapes of his past and goes and makes his ""most personal CD to date"" with dreadful results. Whenever I read an artist decribing his work as ""personal"", it usually means it's going to suck. And this one does... big time! As an avid listener of this genre, this CD is a total artistic failure. With the exception of the vocal track ""Paths"", the album's haphazard, uninspiring and self-indulgent doodlings ultimately amount to nothing. Each track meanders clumsily into the next without a thematic arc. The heavy use of distorted guitar is totally out of place. Maybe after getting 'Organik' out of his system, he can get back to making some music with substance."
4,pleased,"I liked it... Not as much as some of the other essentials in the collection, but it was still worth buying."
1,"Terrible quality, don't waste your money","Should have been tipped off by the very low price of the guitar. From the time we took it out and tried to tune it (tighten strings) it didn't work. Within the first 5 minutes that my toddler played with it the strings came loose and came off, complete waste"
1,Not a good toy!!!!,I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday. My husband plays the guitar and she loves to try and play his. She asked for her own and we thought this would be great for her to just play around with.. Within a few days of giving it to her the strings were already coming off and you can't tighten them....Needless to say it hasn't been a month yet and only one string remains!!!! I now know why it was so inexpensive... Don't waste your money!!!
1,Frets Are Not Tuned Correctly,"After finally tightening down the tuning lugs in the back to keep the strings in tune when open, it became apparent that the frets are in the wrong place. So going up each fret is not quite a half step. You have to go to the 13th fret to get an octave (mornally 12th fret). What this means for non-musicians is that even if the guitar is in tune, as soon as you put the finger of your left hand on the frets to play higher notes, they will always be out of tune and dissonant. There is no way to fix this.Therefore, this ends up being just a toy. A cute toy it is. Just don't plan on playing real guitar music on it."
2,Cheaply built. Wall hanger only...,"I bought this thinking I could use it to teach my granddaughter how to play guitar. It's a toy only, incapable of being tuned. I affixed it to the wall in my recording studio and it suits that purpose nicely. Then I bought a playable guitar at, of course, a much higher cost."
1,Where is the editor?,This book was interesting but I was distracted by the numerous factual errors in it. Names of important teachers were misspelled and at least one teacher was referred to as a coach and placed in a geographic loacation that he did not work. Why didn't anyone check these things before it went to print?? Unacceptable.
3,Unremarkable,"As a bona fide electronica buff, I really wanted to like this album having heard so may good things about it. To me, however, this was a major disappointment. It's perfectly listenable, but a bit too cheesey, predictable and well...Euro for my taste. It's competent but falls short of being remarkable, inspring, or intriguing. Its all a matter of taste, of course. No doubt many of you will love this: it's just not original or adventurous enough to stick out from the crowd."
4,Clever rundown to the ecological end,"The coming decades pose great promise and imminent peril, oracular sci-fi writer Bruce Sterling argues in this compelling critique of the state of the modern world. On the plus side, scientists someday might eliminate disease and allow people to live forever. In the debit column, people are burning so much fuel that humanity is setting itself up for extinction. Sterling combines the analytical acumen of a true visionary with the prose of a master craftsman in this fascinating work seasoned with first person anecdotes. As a futurist, Sterling is too savvy to make concrete predictions that soon might be proven wrong (though some of his U.S. political analysis is already losing topicality), so readers might find his approach a bit obtuse at times. But even Sterling's glancing blows connect. We recommend his intriguing analysis and conjectures to techies and to anyone else who seeks a literate look at what the future might hold."
4,John Michael Talbot - excellent!,The Lord's Supper is an excellent CD of beautiful musical arrangements and vocals/choir backing. Highly recommended. It may be an oldy but it's definitely a goody!
5,a sister's response,I am 10 and I have a 12 year old sister who has Aspergers Syndrome. My mom and dad have been trying to help me understand it for years. My sister always seems to get away with a lot of stuff and she embarrasses me a lot. I like this book because it really explains how I feel. I get annoyed just like Emily and then I feel guilty because my sister has autism and can't help what she is doing. This book let me know that it is OK to get annoyed and for some reason that makes me less annoyed with my sister. I don't know why but it does. Emily says that she feels like the big sister and that is exactly how I feel! I don't like worrying about my sister so I don't like it when we do the same activities. This made my mom understand a little better too. I really recommend this book because it is really true. I haven't really liked any of the other books my mom got me on autism because they weren't really about how I felt but this one is great.
5,miracle!,"I injured my back and could not walk or sit without feeling significant pain- I bought this for my husband for a knee problem (which he never used!), and thought I would try it. Overnight, the pain had diminished. The next day I went back to work without pain. This product is amazing! I recommend it and no, I'm not sharing with my husband- he had his chance!"
3,"Makes You Feel Fresh, but Doesn't Relieve Serious Pain","This product makes skin feel amazing, but I have to say that it doesn't really relieve any serious pain. Its effects are very short lasting, and very intense. I would recommend this more as a cosmetic product than anything else.Ryan"
5,Best of its kind!!!,"I really love this product. Looked all over town for it and couldn't get it so ordered it here. I tried icyhot, bengay, etc. None worked near as good as this. Can't wait to try the one for athrytis."
4,I LIKE OLD THINGS AND THIS IS OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is a realy good aray of christmas songs and the best thing was i got a good used copy for 3.99 the sound is the old good AM sound of yester year i wou recomend thi for enyone wanting to to go back to the hoillday classics
5,Great Wings,I purchased the wings to use in our Christmas Play and they worked perfectly and looked real because of the feathers on them.
3,"Nice, but handle with care.","I used these wings on a cupid photo shoot, for my ten month old. They worked great, but be careful when handling them, Feathers fall out easily.Also had to adjusted the rubber straps by tying a knot. Way to long for any baby or toddler.Stephanie H"
5,Great book for a nice price.,"Great for the price, not big and bulky, easy to carry. I bought to put yearly Christmas pictures in, works perfect."
5,nice product,"this album is nice & durable, just as described. as expected it is not fancy at all, just plain plastic (which is what I was expecting)"
4,Very Ensemble Experience!,"All these works, except perhaps the Kabalevsky, are so familiar that one is braced from the get-go for a virtuoso sermon on what the old warhorses really mean. So, these performances are a sort of relief in being very involved with an ensemble conception of all these attractive works. It is amazing how pleasant these pieces are when one is not being forced to be impressed. The Ravel Tzigane especially benefits from this treatment, as a weaving of the solo lines and orchestra makes points not often heard. Lastly, the Kabalevsky is very spritely and again pleasant, but not the least bit Soviet, which is a plus or minus depending on your aesthetic desiderata."
4,Almost the Perfect Collection!,"I was a fan of the Grass Roots in the late 60's and early 70's and had most of their singles back then. Although this collection is pretty good and includes most of their hit singles, the glaring omission of ""Walking Through the Country"", a chart single from 1970, is the one thing that keeps this from being the definitive Grass Roots CD. Those interested in the band's complete discography would do better by purchasing the two CD collection available here on Amazon.com and elsewhere. Even though it costs more, the additional songs are worth the added expense."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this CD by the Grass Roots thinking I was getting the Grass Roots.....Not!I have a few of their songs on 45 records back form the 60's that are on the CD & the CD sure sounds very different. It's totally not the same group. Imposters!!I would not recommend this CD to any 60's fan.
4,I'm back in the late sixties and smiling,"Each time I listen to this I find myself back in the sixties reliving the innocence of a simpler time, the intriguing music and the memories I associate with them."
5,Golden Grass,"With vocals sometimes reminiscent of Three Dog Night and a horn section that could have rivaled The Ides of March and even Chicago or Lighthouse on a good night, The Grass Roots found a niche with their brand of fussion pop. From classics such as ""Sooner or Later, Midnight Confessions and Temptation Eyes"" to the later hits like ""Two Divided by Love, Glory Bound "" and the surprisingly included "" The Runway"" (all from the ""Move Along"" album,) this collection is a solid representation of The Grass Roots glory days. A piece of trivia; in the 1968 movie ""With Six You Get Eggroll"" Doris Day walks into a bar and on a very small stage are the Grass Roots singing a familiar tune. You'll have to see the movie to find out which song that they are playing. The movie also features Brian Keith and a young George Carlin."
4,I love it,"I love this cd. I wasn't around in the 60's, but I love the music, and I thought all the tracks on this cd were great. Of course I especially love midnight confessions! What a fantastic song."
1,What Gives?,"Is this a Hong Kong bootleg? The quality is so poor and the singers are so obviously not the original ones that I have to wonder. (Plus, the fact that it is an 'import' should be a big clue for you.)"
4,Almost Perfect,"This CD would be the perfect compilation of The Grass Roots were it not for the omission of ""Walkin' Through the Country"" and another less known song, ""Feelings"". The quality of the recordings is excellent. The brass, vocals and instrumental rifts are clear and clean. Obviously remastered from the originals since all the songs sound better than I remember them. Except for ""Where Were You When I Needed You"", which appears to be a redone original. You can tell by the vocal lead trying to enunciate each word in the song. The original release of this song had a more relaxing feeling to it. All in all, I'm very pleased with this CD."
4,"An unknown tidbit about ""The Grass Roots""","before American Bandstand had a song ""written"" for them (by none other than Barry Manilow!) the theme song for American Bandstand was ""Midnight Confessions"" by The Grass Roots!Now, I dare you say The Grass Roots weren't an important musical group! Before MTV, American Bandstand was the BOMB!"
4,Toe Tappin' music,"Let's Live For Today Was one of my first purchased singles. A few years later, Midnight Confessions went to number 1. Then the formula kept clicking out the hits with songs such as ""Lovin' Things"", ""I'd Wait A Million Years"" , ""Baby Hold On"", ""Heaven Knows"". If you are a 60's or 70's DJ, and Temptation Eyes is not on your list- SHAME ON YOU! This is a MUST item for a serious colletor of music from this period. THE GRASS ROOTS had to many top 20 hits to continue and be ignored by oldies shows which only play the top #1's and ignore the rest of the top 40. A good bargain compilation. MUCH CHEAPER THAN A PREVIOUS MULTI-CD SET."
1,Grassroots Greatest Hits complete sham,"I bought this CD, and returned it for a refund in 2001. I am suprised it is still listed in the catalog as it is immediately obvious that the songs are not the originals and the artists could be anybody. This album is a complete misrepresentation and the real product should be found, if it exists at all, and then advertised here."
3,ROOTIE,"Definately a taste of the Old Grass Roots. Not exactly what I expected, but I sould suggest this for purchase."
5,Neat Little Series,There are a lot of these little books and they all are very well done. Our kids love the idea of getting to know about SCIENCE. The 7th grade teachers I work with even use it with their kids in Science class. TryFrom Tadpole to Frog (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1).As I am adding product links I see that Amazon has over 600 titles in this series listed!
5,very impressed,I received the book on time and it is appropriate for my daughter who is three and very much into science and skeletons.
5,A must for any DM whose campaign involves planejumping,This book fleshes out the denizens of the outer planes and the astral.
3,satisfactory,"In HATTRICK, the three stories proceed simultaneously.Milan Luthria's direction is satisfactory, but it's the writing that acts as a spoke in the wheel. Pritam's music is strictly okay. You watch the songs on the big screen without exhibiting any emotion, but forget all about them once the movie ends. 'Wicket Bacha' is the only track that stands out, partly due to its zany filming. Cinematography [Nirmal Jani] is lucid.The performances are up to the mark. Nana carries his part with precision. There're certain roles he excels in and this is one of those. Danny is extremely likable. All you want to ask the veteran is, Where have you been all this while? Paresh gets a serious role this time and the actor proves his versatility yet again."
4,"Good for lotions, but not gels.","Roll-A-Lotion is aptly named. It works well for lotions, but not gels. Gels leak through it. It is easy to clean because the balls can be popped out and in easily."
4,The only thing better than this product...,"The only thing better than this product is having a girl to apply the lotion for you. The people that have bought multiple items are the ones with zero game. Work on your day game boys, then you won't have to look like the weirdo applying lotion to your own back with this thing."
1,Doesn't work with suntan lotion,"I got mine from Bed Bath and Beyond and I tried it with Suntan lotion and it doesn't work. The lotion is not thick at all, but not a pure liquid, either.The box says it works with suntan lotion, which is why I got it.No matter how long I rolled the end on any part of my body, lotion never even seeped out. It's like the balls are almost stuck."
4,How very helpful,I love this roll-a-lotion! The handel makes it so easy to apply lotion to my own back. It is easy to use and also cleans well. I have two because I don't want to be without if something happens to it.
3,rollalotion disappointing,"This product seemed like it would be great, but it does not work at all with my winter body lotion of choice, creamy vaseline. It is very thick and just sits and gunks up the rolling balls. I haven't tried it with thinner lotions which I use in the warmer months."
3,Worked... but flimsy,"The product worked wonderfully for a few weeks. However, the product broke (rendering it useless) after being dropped a very short distance onto a bathroom mat. At this price, however, you get what you pay for.Also, be prepared to go through a lot of lotion."
4,Roll A lotion,This is a great product. I bought one years ago and wanted another. When the first one arrived it wasn't packaged very well and was broken. I contacted amazon who in turn contacted the seller that sent me another the next day and it came in one piece. Very satisfied with the customer service of the seller
1,Should have read reviews first,"I should have read all the reviews first, this is not a 12 pack, as the name suggests, there is only one item included. If I had read all the reviews, I would have instead opted to buy it elsewhere on the site for cheaper. What a shame."
2,Disappointing,"The title of this book suggests that we will be taken on exploratory voyage to look at the evidence for mass extinctions; this is only somewhat true. In spite of quite a lot of talk of finding fossils, the book only actually shows one. The remainig pictures disappoint. Where we are told of thin layer boundries, we get broad landscape photos; where the green to red transition marks an extinction event, we get a black and white picture where not even a change in the shade of grey is evident.This book is more in the genre of explorer's narrative: Darwin's voyage on the Beatle, Huxley's on the Rattlesnake, or even Hooker's travels in Tibet... but there is little adventure involved. While the presentation of evidences for extinction are interesting, and the author, well, authoritative, the mixture of travel and science muddles the whole book."
4,Nice Case,Sturdy little Camera CaseBut one thing I didn't like was it had no inside/outside pocket for extra storage
2,"Ok product, subpar seller","The bag showed up not exactly the same as pictured on the seller's page (this page). It is made decent, however it lacks the inner pocket (as shown in the wrong picture) I was looking for and also as featured in the product photo. Contacted the seller for a return, never heard from them since. It's cheap, so I gave up. It's kind of big by the way."
3,"Good but not great, Longer than it needed to be.","This book was good but not great. At times I felt I was reading a laundry list of names and events. I found myself skipping and skimming rather than reading. However, the book does give plenty of detail and blueprint the way in which you would go about ""buying"" politicians. The story is about a mobster who is buying political votes in order to get gambling legalized in Arizona so he can build a casino. It is a behind the scenes look of how a deal like that gets done. Could have been shorter but the author elected to include every detail of the 3yr undercover case."
4,Good Book,"This is a very good and recent review of carbon nanotube technology. It is not overly technical but is advanced enough to get good information out of, and contains a lot of references for someone interested. I would say it is quite readable, and does not get too boring at most points. I read most of the book, too, so that goes for almost all the book."
3,"science history, but not history","The author may be a respected science historian, but she has clearly not put much effort into political history. Despite citing The Pentagon Papers, she gives a history of the origins of the Vietnam war which is basically the version the US government presented at that time, a version which was thoroughly debunked by The Pentagon Papers. This good-science-history/not-so-good-political-history dichotomy is also evident in other parts of the book.Otherwise a somewhat interesting read. A little heavy on the physics envy though (you'd think being married to a physicist would cure that). We know these are really smart people, we don't have to be reminded of it every other page."
3,Interesting read but not riveting,"This book is an interesting story of the role Jasons have played since WWII. It does not keep you up but it's worth your time. It has good descriptions of some of the projects they have worked on over the years, as well as the story of the political challenges they have faced."
1,Burnt up during first use,"Thought I would save a few bucks, wrong. The drill burnt up the first time I tried to use it. I really didn't use any of the other tools. I ended up returning in and buying new. Costomer service was good, I was able to reach them by phone easily, and they covered the shipping cost to return it. It's unfortunate that it didn't work better, it would have saved some money. I don't feel it's worth it any more, but in the end I didn't lose anything."
3,Ok product,"The lid is a little fussy once you get the liner in. You have to dink around with it to get it lined up just right. Otherwise, it does it's job."
2,Very small diaper pail!,"This was a nice diaper pail and I was really excited to see it had a foot pedal to open the lid. However, when it arrived I saw how TINY it was! I would fill this pail up in one day no problem. We sent it back to get a bigger version with no foot pedal."
4,"good for first year, now is stinky","This worked great for the first year and was well worth the price. However, we only ever threw pee diapers in it and took poop diapers outside. Now after a year, it's starting to get stinky with only pee diapers. It's also been hot here, which seems to contribute. I've had friends say that they're fancier, more expensive diaper pails also get stinky after a year or so."
2,What Bag Size?,"The product description says this pail ""Uses standard plastic bags"". I received the product and none of the bags I had or had ordered specifically for it fit. Would have been helpful to have the capacity noted in gallons like every other pail, but this one didn't and I had to send it back - which was quite a pain because I had discarded the box and had to wait in line at the post office. No UPS returns for this - it had to be the post office."
3,"Good, but small.","I bought two of these pails, one for the nursery upstairs and one for the downstairs changing area. I'm glad I didn't buy into some overpriced refill type system, however I do wish these were just a little bit bigger. I have twins, and at its current size I have to empty the pail about every other day. When emptying the pail you see just how much of the kitchen trash bag is wasted (about 1/2, if not 3/4). When used withMunchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Packthe smell is contained quite well. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, though and I would buy it again. I'd give it more stars and a little more enthusiastic review if it were bigger and didn't waste so much of the bag."
4,Good buy for the money,"This probably isn't the world's best diaper pail, but I needed a spare and you simply can't beat the price. I actually like that it is a bit smaller because it forces me to get rid of those diapers before they have a chance to stink up the room. I use Target bags as inserts. My only complaint is that the bag fits right over the mechanism that makes the foot pedal work(any bag would do this), so you have to work with it a little when you are putting a new bag in. Overall, I like it and would buy it again."
3,doesnt fully open,"bin does not open all the way.Very small, need to empty dailyI do like the air freshener cubby on top of the lid"
2,Too small for cloth diaper use,"This pail seems to be great at keeping odors at bay, but does not hold even a days worth of cloth diapers for us. I ended up buying a regular trash can with a lid."
2,to small,this pail is tiny. i use fuzzi bunz cloth diapers and maybe 6 would fit in there. just did not work out. Instead just bought a nice aluminum auto open trash can. looks nice and holds a lot.
4,Perfect For Cat Litter!,"I purchased this after reading reviews that recommended it for disposing of cat litter. My hubby scoops the litter twice a day and usually just puts it in a plastic bag that he leaves in the closet, but it was really stinky and so he ended up having to throw out the litter every single day. This is not only aggravating, but uses up a lot of plastic bags, which we are not too happy about since we are trying to be environmentally friendly.This pail is ideal for the litter. I do agree with others that when you step on the foot pedal it does not open completely. I am also not sure if there is a specific deodorizing product to be used in the built in deodorizer compartment, but it appears that others are just using anything that works well for them.I use the diaper pail bags from Babies 'R Us (their brand) in this pail and they work/fit great. I also HIGHLY recommend these deodorizers:Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack"
2,Not Big Enough and Foot Pedal Awkward,"This pail could be bigger. I was surprised at how small it actually is when it arrived. The one thing I disliked the most was the foot pedal that opens the lid. The pedal is narrow and works best if you have a very small foot. If you wear slippers to keep your feet warm your foot might be too large to fit into the pedal area. The pail will scoot away from you as you try to fit your foot into the pedal to open the lid, which can be very frustrating during diaper changes. The pail is very low to the ground. It is not really large enough for those who cloth diaper. If it was about six inches taller and 4 inches wider it would be a much more sufficient size. Also, the pedal mechanism needs to be larger and deeper to accommodate larger feet, especially for dads. With some small improvements this pail could be very promising. We are looking for a larger pail and might end up making our own out of something from Rubber Maid."
4,small but nice,"as other reviewers stated, this is small, but i expected that. i think it will work great for our family though."
5,LOVE IT,"I use dryer sheets in the ""freshner"" holder and works GREAT!! i purchased this for the wee pads for my little dog... LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... this combined with the Pet Litter Box is heaven sent"
1,Horrible Product,"Really small, really cheap. Hard to put trashbags in and make them stay up. When you use your foot to open it, the pail just slides away because it is so light and cheap. You really get what you pay for. Too late for us to return, otherwise we would."
4,its great for what it is,"It's great for what it is, I just wish it was a little bigger. However it is easy to use and looks cute! And I love that I don't need to waste money on bag refills, I just use walmart plastic bags or any other grocery store bag and that to me is greener! :)"
3,Smaller than expected,"I thought this product was larger than it really is - Note that the Amazon dimensions must be the box it ships in. Under details it does state that this is only 16"" high. This is more of a disappointment to me because I plan to use it for cloth diapers, and it doesn't look like it would hold more than 8-10 at most. The quality is what you'd expect for the price - adequate."
3,Do Not Buy If You Have A Dog,"It's functional and uses your normal trash bags. Not bad in terms of odors from a full pail, either. At least, for humans. For dogs, on the other hand, it's an attractive nuisance. All they need to do is tip it, and the dirty diapers will spill out. We've had to clean up the mess too many times, and we're buying something to replace it."
1,Not for cloth diapering,"Do NOT buy this can if you intend to use it for cloth diapering. The top doesn't open far enough to drop the diapers in. It will only lift up a few inches, then I have to bend over and lift it up the rest of the way. Not good! Defeats the purpose of having a step/hands free pail. It is okay for now b/c my baby doesn't move, but once he starts wiggling around I can't take my hand and eyes off of him to be fooling with the can.With a thick wet bag in it, the top doesn't come off all that easy either. I could deal with this if the top opened properly.I will put it somewhere else and am ordering a new one."
2,Eh..,"Arrived dirty and scuffed. It works fine, but.. gross. It looks like there was mold growing on the lid that someone hastily tried to wipe away."
1,Looked like a used item,This looked like a used item. There are some human hair in the product. Some nasty stains. Looked like poop. Very bad.
3,Annoying,"I bought this for disposing of cat litter, and it's a little big for that purpose unless you have a LOT of cats or don't take the garbage out more than once a month so I don't recommend it for that. Otherwise, I have no complaints about odor escaping it. My only complaint would be that the lid does not open completely and you have to hold it open with your hand so it's not truly hands free and it's truly annoying."
2,disappointed,"I guess the old adage is true ""you get what you pay for"" I bought this item because I had a gift card and needed a diaper pail. I was mistaken in believing that this was a diaper pal. It's not! It's just a small trash can with a compartment at the top for what I am assuming is an air freshener. This is a guess of course because no air freshener is included. That's right, nothing but a few hole separates this from a normal trash can that can be purchased for $10 at your local store. Seems like an okay trash can but I will have to BUY something else to make it smell better before I but a diaper in it. Disappointing..."
2,Not as described,"The description of this diaper pail says it locks closed, which is the reason I bought it. It does not lock. Also, it had a Safety 1st sticker on it, but the branding on the pail itself was Cosco, a brand known for its cheap baby products. I returned it."
3,foot operated diaper pale,"I needed a foot operated diaper pale, It is hard to get the top off when changing the bag. I would have liked it to be bigger but for home use and one baby it is a great size. So far it has been great no problems works fine."
4,Great cheap diaper pail,"This is great little diaper pale. You can use standard wastebasket liners (I get a 500 pack at costco) which are inexpensive or grocery bags (tight fit). There is a little compartment on the lid for a disinfectant. I use munchkin arm & hammer disinfectant pods from target which fit fine. No odor, no mess, low cost. Probably best for small diapers as the pail is not huge. Our experience is with a Newborn."
1,I wish I could give negative stars...sad that this is the best rated pail,"Nothing positive to say about this pail. I guess you can use your own bags, but a regular garbage pail would be better.Cons:Super smallDoesn't contain smellYou can't open it with your foot, because it just slides out from under you and falls over. I absolutely hate this.This is the one time buying things based on the rave reviews didn't work out. They must have redesigned this pail to suck. I cannot see anyone who received this pail within the last couple months (May 2011) giving this more than a one star. I only kept this pail, because I just use it for wipes. I use cloth diapers, otherwise, I would have thrown this pail out."
2,Smells up the room in every use,"It does a good job keeping the odors out. I don't like it because every time you step on the foot pedal to put a dirty diaper in, it releases the odor. I use diaper pail bags. I empty it almost every day. Sometimes I take it out in the morning. Because the lid is open the smell will escape and makes the room smell. When the lid is closed there is no odor."
2,Not a good option for cloth,"I use cloth diapers and an elastic-top wetbag liner I figured the Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail could work: either bring the liner through the small opening on top, OR pull it over the base with the lid secured on top. Neither works. With the first option, the lid won't close all the way (ewwww). With the second, the lift mechanism can't attach to the lid. Either way, the opening or lid wouldn't be locked securely. Lose-lose. :-(This probably works fine for disposables, but not a good option for cloth diaperers."
2,Too small for wet cloth diapers (but good for the poopy ones in the bathroom),"I ordered two of these to use with my 2 year old son's cloth diapers. I use a PUL pail liner that I sewed myself. We currently have one in my son's room and one in the bathroom. We use a diaper sprayer on the poopy diapers and then put those in one of these in the bathroom. For this purpose, I think this can is great. It's not very big (a plus for our tiny bathroom). I like that it has a space where you can put a baking soda disk to control smell. The pedal to open it isn't very powerful, so the lid only opens about halfway, but that's OK. The can is really too small for my son's wet cloth diapers in his room. I can't make with two days of diapers, so I think we will switch to a larger can for that purpose. We use a combination of mostly prefolds and some bumgenius, so I would guess that ours take up even less space that someone with an infant using entirely pocket diapers or all in ones."
2,Bought two...,"..and neither of them work as they are supposed to. For being ""step"" diaper pails, they are not simple as listed, nor do they lift, which make it very difficult to even use when you have a baby in your hands. I have to bend down and throw the diaper in from the side to get it in..."
4,Better than I expected,"We aren't using this for cotton diapers, but instead use it for poopy panties. It works better than we expected and I'm sure if used for diapers it would work well for that also. I recommend it to any one that has a child in potty training in big girl or big boy underwear, as well as for diapers. Especially when they have had a BM, which is very hard to get out of the underwear. Soaking them in the pail with chlorox and water for a few minutes works great."
3,gets stinky,"It's great for our purposes, but definitely needs the deodorant in the lid. We also empty and reline it outside, spraying it with Lysol and dumping soda in it. That helps a lot."
3,It's okay....,When buying this product.... Make sure you purchase glad outdoor fresh sheild bags and sassy's diaper sacks. These will help to keep the bad diaper smell from taking over.
4,Great pail for the price,"I purchased this for the dog. Works great. Leaving it in the garage. Don't think it will work indoors as well as it is not entirely sealed, but for the garage it is a great product."
3,Wasn't *New* as posted...,"I purchased this knowing that I would be using it for cloth diapers for my second baby. I am yet to actually use the container for this use, but have tested the function of it, even with my polly-re-washable bags and it seems to function very well.Amazon did say that this item was ""new"" but it most definitely was not. There are small scuff marks on the outside of the can and ""residue"" (I don't even want to think about how disgusting someone else's ""residue"" is) on the inside of the lid and container that needed to be washed off with bleach.I read the return/exchange policy and it seemed like too much work to exchange a ""new"" item for something that might be worse than what I ended up with.Other than that, the can itself is small but seems like it will do the job."
4,3.5 days of diapers,Holds about 3.5 days of diapers for me. Which might be good because it forces me to wash them before they strt growing stuff :). I wouldn't mind piling up a little longer though... I use with kissas reusable liner.
5,Works like a charm,"I use this for my catbox. I scoop into a plastic bag, keeping odor discs in the compartment under the lid. Stops the smell. Since it's emptied every couple of days, there's no smell in the house."
3,small okay diaper pail,"This is a very small diaper pail and while I haven't used it yet (bought it for the arrival of my 2nd child and didn't want to end up with 2 giant diaper pails - figured this could be converted into a cat litter trash can afterward), it seems like there are no mechanisms for keeping the ""scent"" in. We'll see though...It does not have a blue lid as others have described and is all a white/grey monotone color. Have the diaper champ for my older son which I have found to be a very functional diaper pail - large, keeps smell down as much as possible, etc."
4,safety 1st diaper pail,I bought this for my washable puppy pee pads. It is a great size for the laundry room and helps keep down the odor so I am not embarrassed. It is a little smaller than I expected but it turns out to hold about a weeks worth for one 3 lb yorkie.
4,"Great Price, Easy to Clean, Lightweight, Uses various bags","We have been using this diaper pail for 16 months and counting now. We selected this diaper pail as it was among the cheapest options and we haven't been disappointed. We find that we can keep 2-3 days of diapers in this pail before having to change the bag. We appreciate that this pail doesn't require a specific diaper pail bag, we often use the bags from the grocery store or Target/CVS (these seem to fit best). This diaper pail is also very easy to clean - snap off the lid, empty it out, bring it to the sink to clean. Our only criticism of this diaper pail is that the lid doesn't open fully, causing you to have to bend down in order to toss the diaper into the bin."
3,"Okay for the job, but foot pedal is the issue here",I agree with another reviewer that the foot pedal doesn't lift the lid up very well and if you don't snap the lid back on correctly (or put it back on backwards) of course it won't work. The foot pedal is also really tucked into the bin so you can't step on it if you're wearing chunky slippers like I do in the cold weather. It's a very basic bin and I use a plastic trash liner I got in bulk [...]. Right now I am using disposable diapers and I can't smell anything around the bin unless I open it.
2,Way to small for cloth diapers and the foot pedal is lame,"I bought this pail despite the reviewers who said it was too small for cloth diapers. Well, trust them, it's way to small for cloth, unless you want to wash every day. I found myself piling dirty diapers on top of it! Ew! The biggest problem is the foot pedal. Even if you're not going to use this pail for cloth diapers, the food pedal doesn't work all that well (and we had it connected correctly). Stepping on it brings the lid up about 1 inch. Not very useful. Perhaps ours was defective. Also, grocery shopping bags are too small and kitchen trash bags are too big! Save your money and get something bigger and better functioning."
4,Great Music for a bad movie,"I must have been one of the dozens who actually paid to see American Anthem on the big screen; the movie that proved as actors Mitch Gaylord and the future Mrs. Gretzky were good gymnasts. This film stunk badly. HOWEVER, the music was great; classic 80's fare. The soundtrack arrived in great conditon and quickly."
5,Great early stuff,"If you understand what you're getting, this is a great compilation of early Wailers. You have to understand the phases they went through, (which followed the Jamaican music scene in general), with early soul & r&b influences, ska and rocksteady. THis is still great music, though, and this is one of my favorite compilations of their earlier stuff."
1,Disappointed...,"I received this today but had to send it back because all 20 tracks have treacly overdubs on it. I'm disappointed that this was not in the product description. Something like: ADVISORY: THIS ALBUM CONTAINS BILIOUS CHEAP SYNTHESIZER OVERDUBS ON TOP OF HISTORIC RECORDINGS. This album contains a good cross section of the Wailers' Studio One work and some songs are really, really good. Too bad someone couldn't leave well enough alone."
2,not what i expected,"i got this cd, thinking it would be more like his newer (old) reggae, and to me, it totally wasn't. I don't like this cd at all, and i'm going to re-sell it."
2,Simple softcore...,Simple softcore storyline. Easy story with some sexy scenes and simple dialogue. Wish there were more scenes of Jenna. Received DVD in good condition.
3,Puny Kokopelli Pendant,"When I ordered this pendant, I knew Kokopelli was ""the trickster,"" but I didn't know he is also the fertility deity. Guys (and gals), if you didn't know this, you are now forewarned!I am not very happy with this pendant, the third of three I ordered at the same time (Dan's Jewelers). It's well done, and the colors are great, but the pendant is so lightweight that it won't even pull the sting straight. I'll find some use for it, but it won't be for hanging around my neck. Cool design, but it needs a little heft to make it a practical pendant purchase. Hear that, Dan?"
3,"cheap, but limited","If all you want is a tilting head for your monopod, then this product is a good buy. For slightly more money, you should also consider the Bogen 3229 head which is similar to the 3232, but with a built-in quick release plate. To many people, the quick-release feature is even more important than the tilt feature."
1,Bogen-swivel tilt head,"Was lead to believe that this was needed with my purchase of a mono-pod. It wasn't. Unless I am too ignorant and can't figure out to use it, it was a waste of my hard earned 'shekels'. The unit seems to be of superior quality but not needed on a mono-pod. I would work well on a tri-pod not having an adjustable head. I would give it a 5 star rating on quality but give it only 1 star for functionality in my case. It is now sitting in the closet gathering dust."
1,Buyer Beware,Amazon has the wrong picture for this door latch. The original Brighton Surface Latch I ordered is pictured as having a lock mechanism. The product I received has no lock. Don't order this if you need a lock.
5,Class,"For those who enjoy the sound gallery series, this is the hidden master peice - I bought this off spec some years ago and am listening to it still now - think E Type Jag on th french Riveria, this is a class funky lbum, some scorching gem in there.... not worth the huge price they are asking for 2nd hand - but still great - contact me if you need a copy."
2,Okay but the movies more entertaining.,"I just could not get into this book. It seemed to be written by a military man for a military man/woman to read! Maybe it was just me but I just couldn't get into the book version of this story. I decided to watch the movie when it came to the big screen just to see if it was as frustrating as the book. As it turned out, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you enjoy reading military type books with a lot of military type talk then this really is a book for you. Personally, I plan on sticking to the straight talk, everyday kind of books I'm used to."
3,Piece's of the puzzle...,"Although this is outdated material/film, it still adds piece's to the ""Unknown Puzzle of life,"" as we know it. For the most part, even when a bad review is given I'll still observe the info./film/books/Utube lectures because sometimes very small puzzle parts are understood down the line-path. I'd say, if the information is pertaining to one's interest, it doesn't hurt to spend alittle time thumbing through or fast forwarding along...Although, I could be wrong?David"
1,Not Worth It,"Don't bother with this stroller. There are much better strollers out there for the price (Chicco, Maclaren etc). Canopy is tiny, wheels are rickety, stroller is heavy for it's size, if you are over 5'4 you will kick the wheels when you walk. Fabric is unattractive & rough, my daughter refused to sit in it."
3,It's OK But...,"I bought this stroller because I needed a lightweith one for my 7-month old, 22lb son to keep in the car. I tried it out in the store first and liked the look and manueverability.But...I didn't realize that the 5-point harness had to be put together each time you lock in the child. Somewhat challenging with a wriggling 7-month old. I also didn't know that the stroller doesn't stand up when folded...very unweildy for tight spaces when you have to close it on all four wheels.Other than those two negatives, the stroller is OK. My son has liked the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse since he was 5 weeks old and seems drawn to the pattern on the stroller. One other thing - it's not as lightweight as other lightweight strollers."
1,Not a good quality stroller,"After one year, this stroller became very difficult to use. The wheels have become incredibly hard to steer and folding/unfolding is painful, you need both hands at all times. I'm very dissatisfied."
2,Takes two people to unfold it,"Yes, it's lightweight and folds down in to a small size, but it takes two people to unfold it. The locking mechanism is so poorly designed. Pretty useless if you can't take it with you unless you have another person along just to help you unfold. LAME"
4,Great folds-small stroller!,"I love this stroller! It is not perfect, but in terms of size it is! I love that it folds down so small for my vehicle and isn't a huge stroller to push around. It's comfortable for my daughter, it has a nice basket, the handles are comfortable, it's easy to push, and my infant seat snaps onto it! So many of my mom friends got huge strollers with their carseat and end up really disliking how big it is and buying another stroller later on. They all comment on how mine's the perfect size. :)Cons:* I never could get the cupholder to snap on. It ought to, it's there... I just can't get it to fit!* The basket, while a pretty good size, is really hard to access when the seat is fully reclined (as it has to be when you put your infant seat on it)* The canopy is pretty small.* Folding it down and unfolding it up really does take two hands.Pros:* Price! Very affordable.* Size, just right.* Easy to use.* Comfortable for her and me."
1,Breaks engage while backing up stairs,"This would be the most awesome lightweight umbrella stroller for under $200 ever, if only the breaks were not set up in such a way that the breaks engage if you are trying to back the stroller up a step or curb with only one person. The step pushed the break into the locked position making it impossible to roll up the step.Otherwise it's a great stroller but if I'd known I wouldn't be able to use stairs without another person with me I would not have purchased it. Elevators only for this stroller."
3,Disappointed,"I put this on my registry for no reason more than it was Mickey Mouse. BIG MISTAKE. I am so disappointed and frustrated with this stroller. I didnt even realize or forgot there was a cup holder as apparently it was so cheap it fell off and now its missing. The sun shade is not maneuverable on the sense you can not pull it down to block the sun out it stays put where it is and folds up and down, thats it. If you pull on it even slightly too hard it falls off the stroller completely! SO frustrating! The holder underneath is SO small. Diaper bag wont fit. I even tried a smaller diaper bag still wont fit. So we just hardly use it at all. We have to hand pocket books and diaper bags on the handles which makes for obnoxious pushing. Wish I knew these things beforehand. Its the simplest things that make life SO much easier when your out with the little ones. It is lightweight and easy to push. I love the style and quick and easy to take in and out of the trunk."
4,Pefect for my needs,This stroller is wonderful! It has great manueverability and is so easy to use. It is extremely lightweight and very compact! My only complaint is that the basket is really hard to use if you're using your graco infant carseat.
3,Lightweight but hard to clean,"Pros: lightweight, easy to collapse, folds up fairly small, and has a small basket below (which most umbrella strollers do not).Cons: impossible to keep clean (we take good care of our things but it always looks like it's a third-time hand me down), can't take the fabric part off to put it in the washing machine, doesn't truly allow your child to sit upright or to recline all the way back--its seat back keeps your child in a slouching position.It's served us well, but I can't say I'd get it again."
3,Good stroller- Only Flaw- Metal Rods on baby's head,"PROS:*Deep recline for a newborn or toddler. The recline is deep enough to do a quick diaper change on the go.*Guard rail- very convienent to snap on and off. My son loves to pull himself on the guard rail as he explores his new surrondings.*Easy to fold- one hand system- collapses in seconds.*Good size storage basket.*Very reasonable price.*Nice design/ pattern- unisexCONS:*On the head area (where the baby head lays) there are two metal rods that sandwhich his head. The baby's head will kind of fall in between the rods- In my opinion, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.My solution was to fold a blanket as use it as a pillow cushion.*Peek a boo window very small- hard to see baby.*Not that lightweight. not a public transportation stroller,(if you plan on going on the bus and trains, this will be too heavy)"
3,wierd,"this cd is absolutly the strangest i have ever heard...it really has only like 3 songs on it with a musical influencs, and the rest are just excerpts from radio programs...but its so wierd that its good."
5,Great Dinosaur Train,This is a great collection of the Dinosaur Train series. My kids love to watch this video and the music gets them moving.
5,Looks good. Sturdy.,"I put this in my home bar and it looks great. It is solidly built. I could not find a stud in the correct location so I put a large rectangle of plywood on the wall, painted it, and attached the bracket to it. The tv covers it and everything looks great."
2,Beware You would Need a UAM with this one..Check the Site,This is ridiculous when it states that it can hold any LCD TV. I have a Toshiba 32AV500U and if you need to mount that then you need to get an extra UAM (Universal Adaptor Mount).Now I need to buy UAM which will cost anount 60-100 dollars...
5,Fantastic,"This TV mount would hold twice the advertised weight easily, This should sell for much more as it is everything advertised and more. 5 Stars from me."
5,"Easy to use, good function.","This is the second omnimount product that i have purchased. I have the larger and smaller mounts. There are a lot of reviews commenting on panel drift and that the screws provided are inadequate. I did not find this to be true. Granted both of my applications are for tv's that are at the lower end of the recommended range however, i see no sign of this problem. These mounts are affixed easily with a great functional use and good esthetics. I would only mount these directly into a stud for sense of security."
2,Need 3 people to install,"I bought this for my 26"" LCD TV. The weight of my TV is 30lb and this mount weights 14lb, to me mount to TV weight ratio is too much.Secondly this mount comes as one unit. You screw the mount to the wall then you need two people to lift the TV and hold it in air while you mount(6 screw) it to the TV. I was hoping they make something in two pieces, one you attach to tv and other to attach to wall and then you just snap them together.Third when I installed the TV on the wall the top part of the mount was still visible on top of TV. So make sure you read mounts dimensions before you buy it.Lastly there are no horizontal adjustments for this mount. If the stud in the wall is not in the center then the TV will not be centered when flushed to the wall. This is not a problem of this particular mount but all the cantilever/arm kind of mounts are designed this way.I think it is a good mount for bigger (more than 26"") and heavier TVs."
1,Doesn't sound Biblical to me!,"I just read the first couple of pages here on Amazon.The idea about the word and the Son being the same doesn't sound right - the Son is a person, whereas the word (in general rather than as a name of the Son) is God speaking, either audibly or in Scripture. Anyone can see that the Bible isn't literally Jesus!On the second page (page 8) the idea of me sending a blessing to someone through God sounds more like magic/self-idolatry than Christianity. Christian prayer exalts God's will alone, and accepts that I may not understand God's will completely"
4,Nice gift to send,"This was a quick and easy way to send a gift to someone non-locally. As far as we know, quality was good."
2,d,"This was a smaller box. I could not open it and view it before giving it as a gift. I could not see all the contents, and would like to have viewed this so that I know all was included, and nothing was damaged."
4,Fez monkey suit was adorable,The fez monkey suit was as cute as the picture. The delivery of the suit was within the estimated time range. I was pleased with my purchase.
3,Krups coffee maker,I don't like that it does not have an automatic shutoff. My last Krups machine just lasted five years so I am hoping this one will last longer
1,Already Trashed,"It just quit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would not do anything, too expensive to have not lasted longer. Will never purchasethis brand name again. Not anywhere near worth the money. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great,So far it is working great. The last one we had lasted for 17 years. The only problem we have with this unit is that you can not make coffee and Espresso at the same time.
4,Makes a good cup of coffee and espresso,"I've had this machine for about two weeks and it works great. Granted it's not a high-end machine, but it gets the job done. After reading other reviews about the handle breaking off the espresso pitcher I've been gentle with mine and haven't run into a problem.I'd recommend this machine if you want a combo unit and don't want to pay $100s more. It makes a great cup of coffee and an awesome latte. I might have given it a higher rating if it had a thermal caffe."
4,good buy,"I got this for my husband who is a coffee drinker. He loves using it - it's simple to use, cleans easily, and makes excellent coffee and espresso!"
2,seems like a downgrade of what i had before,"i had the previous model which i loved, and bought this one because i couldnt find the previous one. i didnt realize it didnt have a clock, auto-shutoff or a timer. these things are a big plus, and i dont understand why they wouldnt have it in an espresso/coffeemaker combo machine. oh well, i returned it."
3,Sent to Uk with american plug and no adaptor !!,"Purchased this machine for a christmas gift only to find it has a american two pin plug on !This product was shipped to uk and did not state that an adaptor whould be required,i whould have thought that it would should arrive with uk fittings if sold to uk or they should have made clear that this was not the case."
1,Huge disappointment!,"I read the reviews before ordering, but thought perhaps the reviewers were a bit harsh. Wish I had taken them more seriously. This was the worst coffee maker we have ever owned. The espresso worked intermittently. The water was difficult to access when on a counter under an upper cabinet. The espresso was not hot enough! Impossible to see the water level without bright lights!"
3,Does the job but...,"Bought this coffee maker to replace an old Krups Cafe Duomo that Krups doesn't make anymore. Handed that one down to my college kid. Would love to get it back and give her this new one! This model is much larger, taking up more counter space. It smelled like hot plastic when in use for the first three weeks. Worst, you can't brew coffee and espresso at the same time as you could with the old model. This model has one switch to choose either espresso or coffee brewing rather than independent switches to accommodate coffee for my husband and espresso for me. The old model had a separate switch for each. Less steam pressure on the espresso than I'm used to too. It does the job, but I'd spend more and get a better model if I had to do it over again."
2,Not as good as predecessor,"I owned Kups CafeDuo for years and loved the quality of espresso and steam milk coming out of it. As my old machine aged I tried various semi-automatic espresso machined and never found one better than my CafeDuo. So when the time came to replace the old faithful, I reached for its replacement XP1500. I am very disapointed. Stemed milk comes out cold. After two weeks trying I am still unable to produce espresso with crema. Definitely not a match for its predecessor."
2,Hopeful,"Saw some mixed reviews and thought I would give it a try anyway. The espresso is good. The coffee though tastes like plastic. I ran water through the cycle 25+ times hoping to clean it out. No luck! Also, the cord isnt very long. So storing it under cupboards wasnt the most convenient."
1,Done with this,"We received this coffee maker from our wedding registry 3 years ago. I wish we'd done more research before picking it. The covers for the on lights broke off a long time ago, the heating plate is irreparably charred no matter how much I try to clean it, and it has never produced a very hot cup of coffee. The final straw is that its now exploding grounds out the side of the machine every other day despite all my attempts to clean, adjust, change the thickness of the grounds, etc. I have to keep dismantling the whole filter assembly to try and clean it out then attempt to wedge the cheap plastic parts back together. It seems obvious to me now that an all plastic machine simply isn't going to hold up to long term daily use. The replacement is on the way."
1,Disappointed,"Krups XP1500: We bought this model as a replacement for a similar model that served us well for 10 years. Coffee was not good and we believe the thermostat stuck because it just went on heating getting hotter and hotter. We also were disappointed in Amazon because they did not offer the same model with a timer and more features.Sent back for refund, which actually cost us an additonal $12 because we could not get the same freight rate that Amazon received. We live and learn.Krups XP1500 Coffee and Espresso Combination Machine, Black"
1,BAD KRUPS,"It doesn't work, I had to order a US to UK transformer in order to operate this appliance.This item was to have a digital display screen but the appliance I received didn't have this.I am really disappointed as I have always had Krups coffee machines in the past and am now thinking that it's about time I tried some other make.I am deeply upset with this item."
4,best buy,"I looked at lots of machines because I wanted quality but didn't feel like paying for balls and whistles. This coffee maker does what it is supposed to. It makes great espresso and great coffee. If you can live without chromes and brass and all that jazz, this is a great buy."
2,Cheaply Made,"I had a Krups espresso/cappuccino machine for 14 years. It was a great little machine, well-made, so when it finally died, I wanted another Krups. This one is nothing like the old one. It's very cheaply made. The handle on my carafe broke off after only 3 weeks, and all I was doing at the time was washing it. The plastic is weak and very thin, unlike my old Krups. Further, the frother has very little adjustment: it's either ON full-bore, blowing huge bubbles in your milk, or it's off. The positives? Well, the coffee is okay, and it's quiet. That's it. I'm taking this piece of junk back and getting another brand. Anything but Krups."
2,Didn't last as long as it's predecessor.,"Bought this to replace an older model Krups combo which worked like a champ for years! This one lasted 18 months and died. The coffee maker just stopped completely mid-pot, and we can't figure out why. Espresso side still works, but frankly, is a lot more cumbersome a process than with the old model."
1,A good concept cheaply executed,"Here's the skinny -This is the least expensive coffee/espresso maker I could find. I use it daily. It's a steam driven machine, so if you are a serious espresso fiend, you'll be disappointed. It just doesn't crank out enough pressure to give you an authentic espresso. It does an ok job at a fast shot of really strong coffee.The thing that really and truly is disappointing is the glassware. I'm pretty careful about how I take care of my things. But repeated heat + washing makes the plastic handle on the espresso carafe get a little brittle. Then the handle and lid break off of the carafe. Replacements for the carafe are $20 or so. And they don't have any kind of warrantee on the carafe. You can call Krups and ask for one, but their customer service is pretty rude about it. That effort will not be met with success."
3,unhappy,"We were very disappointed in this product. IT does not have the all important "" automatic power off"" feature,the power on light is imposible to see, it is blue and small. We could not get the frother to froth with any consistancy no matter how many ways we tried. producing coffee and espresso worked well."
3,"Has been reliable for 5 years, plastic parts starting to break","I use the espresso machine daily for my morning latte. It has worked like a charm during this period. I rarely use the coffee side, I use french press for coffee. The plastic handle that attaches the filter holder got loose after 5 years, so I tightened it, must have been too tight because the plastic split and broke off. I've been using without a handle for a few months now, not a problem since it's a single batch operation for me and it's easy to untwist when cool. I think the 'ss grid' in the description is actually plastic."
2,Twice disappointed,Bought this model after similar older model was discontinued and could no longer get replacement parts such as to replace the busted coffee pot. The newer model (XP 1500) heating element or hot plate burnt out after a year so we accepted the loss and bought the same model because it did make a good pot of coffee and espresso. The newest version we purchased earlier this year puts off a disgusting burnt plastic odor when a pot of coffee is made. I suspect because of the fine Chinese plastic materials used in the manufacturing. So much for that fresh coffee aroma in the morning. Very discouraged and dissapointed. Espresso maker works fine.
2,Unfortunate Purchase,"It is unfortunate that a fine old German manufacturer has its products made in China out of inferior materials.It is made with a foul smelling plastic which is permeated throughout the product. The coffee tastes like the plastic and is undrinkable, not to mention the foul smell it leaves throughout the kitchen. I contacted Krups USA with my complaint and they suggested that I rinse it with vinegar, which I already had done several times, including brewing it through the system. They then offered to evaluate the system for me at their expense. I didn't them to tell me that it stinks. I cannot return it to Amazon because of their no return policy on used items. I continue to work on the system hoping to one day enjoy it. Until then, buyer beware. This product stinks!"
1,Disappointed Krups Fan,"We had a Krups Espresso/Coffee maker before and it lasted close to 15 years before it started sputtering profusely when making standard coffee. We were very happy with it so decided to order this as a replacement. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews ahead of time. The handle on the espresso carafe broke after 4 weeks of use - yep, the day after our 30 day return policy ended. When making standard coffee, the machine smells and tastes like plastic - strange and the smell hasn't gone away after 3 weeks of use (I was cracking it up to a 'new' smell). Frustrating and disappointing."
4,Good product,Makes great coffee. Only a 10 cup carafe but very well made. Making espresso and foaming milk has been a learning experience. It takes such little water to make but there is usually some water left over in the reservoir so you have to make adjustments to your measurements. I've let the steam run out in an empty cup to allow the reservoir to empty completely. All in all a great product for the price.
2,"Low pressure, no adapters for espresso pods","The espresso pump on this machine really is pretty weak. It makes a big difference in the flavor. In addition, most espresso machines have an adapter that you can slide into the espresso basket that allows you to use the paper wrapped coffee pods (ESE size.) This one does not. In fact, there's no adapters for anything other than the full four cup measure. So to get even the 4 bar pressure, you have to make 4 cups of espresso at once.Go for a 15 bar machine on the espresso and make sure that it comes with different basket inserts, instead of just the one."
1,Krups XP 1500 coffee and expresso machine combo,It broke after a month and I wasted my money. You wouldn't take it back! It was going to cost more to ship it to the company with no guarantee that they could fix it.
2,Not what I bargained for,"I thought I was buying a premium coffee maker for my wife. I do not drink coffee, so I was surprised when my wife said she needed to heat her coffee in the microwave as the maker did not get hot. Also the steamer for lattes does not Work properly. I got the machine on sale for $100. It retailed for $150. I still feel shortchanged."
1,Espresso steamer stopped functioning. Carafe broke right away.,Literally just broke apart. Never fell. Never roughly handled. Today I went to make an espresso and the steamer just stopped functioning. I'm so sad.
1,"espresso okay, coffee terrible","I have never had a problem with Krupps products until now. Have had this machine for a month. Difficult to steam the milk as you can see from other reports, but the coffee side is terrible. The filter basket has a weird smell like burnt paper and the taste gets into the coffe. yuk, cannot drink it. I put in 8 cups of water and get 5 cups of coffee. Poor quality all around. Using it for the okay espresso but not using the coffee maker anymore. Best to buy a better quality product and will when I can afford it."
3,"Good coffee, BUT","As a lover of good strong coffee, I am very happy with the machine. Yet, the carafes have attached lids that do not come off when washing the carafes. It makes it difficult to clean and the lid snapped off the expresso carafe the third time I used it.. Not a very good design.. (new)"
1,Krups XP 1500 Coffe Maker and Espresso Machine,"I had a Krups XP 1500 Coffee maker and Espresso Machine for approx 10 years and loved it. It quit working and I ordered a new one July 24th, 2012. What a disappointment! This machine made coffe that tasted and smelled like burnt plastic no matter how I tried to clean it. It was made in China. Now I am looking for a coffee maker made in USA. Who needs to drink burnt plastic in the coffee? The whole house smelled like burnt plastic and my tounge burned after drinking my coffee for hours. For all I know it may be a carcinogenic, also. I just sent it back.Would not recommend this to anyone."
2,I hate this machine.,"I hate this machine. I like to drink espresso so I absolutely wanted a machine that would make both coffee and espresso. The main problem is the machine has no automatic shut off so if I leave the house and forget to manually turn off the machine, the coffee evaporates and the pot burns. I didn't think they made machines like that anymore - it should come with fire insurance. Also, the coffee results are spotty. Sometimes the coffee is great but then I've had several times when only hot water has come through. The coffee filter holder is very hard to fit into the machine. You have to line it up exactly with a hard to see notch to insert it. I have a Krups coffee grinder that has been a wonderful workhorse for me so I decided to buy this when my DeLonghi gave up the ghost (that one I loved). I would never recommend this and if you want to buy it from me, I'll give you a good deal! I am going to call Krups and see if they will take it back or exchange it. Ha, good luck to me."
2,Expect better performance for price,"I did not buy the Krups espresso coffee maker from Amazon, but received it as a gift. By my standards this is an expensive coffee maker. I was so excited to use this, as it was replacing my junky old Mr. Coffee that is probably older than me, and was basically running hot water over grounds.Pros: this Krups coffee maker looks good and brews strong, tasty coffee.Cons: the most disappointing aspect, and the reason for only 3 stars, is that the carafe does not fit well with the drip spout. Coffee gets backed up. Grinds find their way into the carafe. Sometimes it leaks.For the price I expect better design mechanics."
1,Lousy froth!,"My previous espresso machines were Krups and Starbucks Barista. Having good experience with my previous Krups, I thought this machine would be as good. NOT. No crema. Steam wand is weird, doesn't froth well. The machine feels cheap. I'm going to take it back."
2,Filter Coffe is Good Espresso is not so,I have previously owned a separate Krups Espresso machine and it made great espresso. This one doesn't. The problem is the amount of coffee you have to put in to make an espresso they say 2-4 cups but if you make two you cant compact the coffee unless your making for four so no crema ever :(. Filter coffee is fine and has a nice cut off feature when you take away the pot whilst coffee is being made. The build is not great and don't get the feeling its going to last that long...
2,Dissapointment,"I purchased the Krupps combo Espresso/Coffee maker for Husband as a gift.It made the worst coffee I have had in a long time. I've used same brandcoffee for years, but it tasted like coffee is old. Espresso wasn't muchbetter. To bad it is a nice looking coffee maker."
1,useless,"The steamer / frother is useless and is way too low to work well at all. Very hard to follow the Krups directions - the manual is just poor and i was still trying to figure out if maybe I was doing something wrong, but after reading more reviews - it is not just me. After giving up on the cappuccino - the coffee part actually makes coffee that tastes like plastic. Before I had a $30 coffee maker that made much better coffee. What a waste of money."
2,Are you sure its not Ku-rupt,"In short, this machine made great tasting espresso, and marginal coffee. This gift from my parents gave me higher hopes of a slighlty more refined level of coffee connoisseur-ship, but was dissappointed after the device failed within 2 months. Frankly the device is cheap and belongs on a WalMart shelf for $20."
3,Krups XP1599 Coffee and Espresso,"Purchased a refurbished Krups XP1500 Coffee and Expresso Combination Machine, Black as a wedding gift for a neice. The packaging box was crushed as was the interior manufacturers packaging."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. The coffee is delicious! Its really easy to operate too. However, the steam wand's function entirely stopped after 3 weeks. I called Krups to troubleshoot it, and she told me I would have to return the product, and that there was no hope that it would fix itself. Basically, this machine is a gimmick. The coffee maker is durable, but the espresso part is for the infrequent user. Do not buy this if you intend to make yourself a latte every once in a while.Overall, I am disappointed in this product. I really liked it; then it broke after light usage. I only had it for 3 weeks!!"
3,Disappointed,"Well, I bought this coffee maker around 3 years ago and I got some good use out of it but it just stopped working a couple of months ago. I also agree that the machine feels cheep and I guess it proved cheap since it stopped working. I never had a coffee maker just die on me and I am disappointed that I only got 3 years out of it."
2,Bad choice!,"I love both coffee and espresso but have limited counter space and this looked like the perfect machine. It's been a perfect nightmare. The machine arrived and worked fine, except water poured from it all over the counter. Krups agreed to repair or replace the defective machine. It took two months! The machine was repaired, rather than replaced. I set it up to make espresso and nothing happened: the water never got hot. I tried a second time and it worked fine. The coffeemaker side is great, but for espresso? The good price is not worth the hassle!"
1,Sad :(,Got this for our wedding. The pressure on the espresso died shortly after we started using it... maybe a few months of making great lattes a few times a week but no more :(Furthermore there is no way to repair it. The screw to take it apart is impossible to get to!
1,"Good coffee, crappy build quality","While this machine might make a decent espresso, I highly recommend AGAINST buying it. It's extremely cheaply made, and the handle of the sieve holder broke off the FIRST day I used it. This machine is cheap in price because it is extremely cheap in quality. Save yourself the headache and buy a different one"
3,Seriously,"This was not as interesting as the first. Listening to them drone on about what they were gonna talk about and had talked about was tedious. The celebrity interviews for an hour, ugh! It would have been more interesting if some had allowed us to watch their process like Ricky did.And you mean to tell me from New York to LA, you could find ONE midwife or Doula (a joke by the way) of color.Doulas, don't get me started! $500 to $5,000 for a cheerleader. people, thats what Mommas, Grand Mommas, Best-friends, siblings and partners are for!!!Think i will go get my certification as a Doula..."
5,Yesterday,"Beautiful movie; I absolutely loved. Moving story of the resilience of one African woman living in poverty, but determined to make a better life for her daughter."
5,"""Oh generation of the thoroughly smug. . .""",Please allow yourselves 95 minutes to see how this generation of Southern Africans live. Then: wake up; appreciate; feel. . .
5,"Pure Beauty, Unbearable Sadness","I was in Kenya when I saw this movie by accident on TV. After a few minutes I could not let my eyes away from the TV set. The story is simple, the narration is slow and yet you are glued to the screen. The love of this mother for her daugher jumps to your face with very few words and a tough fight against day-to-day adversity, against the disease and against the hostile neighbors.I left this movie as emotionnaly wrenched as I was after I read ""On the Beach"" by Nevil Shute.Brace yourself and dive into this movie. You'll be changed for ever."
4,sad movie,"i read about this movie.. didn't know anything about it.. once i got it home.. i didn't realize it was foreign.. but sub-titled.. i was about to put movie back in case.. but it picked up.. and i'm glad i looked at it..its always interesting to see how other countries deal with different situations.. but, this is the same as america.. ppl scared of someone who has HIV, and Aids.. it was touching.. and sad.. but.. it was a good movie to watch"
5,Yesterday,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is beautiful, sad and inspirational all at the same time."
5,Great Movie,"This movie so strongly corresponds to much of the information given in books like ""African Feminism"" and ""Black Death: AIDS in Africa"" to name a few. The depiction of Yesterday's grief and acceptance, in addition to her husband's denial, rings true and brings tears to your eyes. One interesting point is the fact that HIV is not even mentioned until half way through the movie, even then it is called 'the virus.' This could mimic the attitude of silence by Africans on the issue. Other fine points about this film include the fact that is truly one story. Yesterday is not then compared to thousands of other dying women, although we know that this is the case. We see the world through her eyes and in her small village. This is a movie about the power of the human heart. Great movie. I would definitely recommend this movie."
2,For the tech only,A compilation of ideas from developers. Not exactly what I was looking for. Does not have detail about current in use cluster panels. Does give ideas of what may be coming in near future autos.
3,Grandson's Xmas watch.,I like this watch because my grandson was really excited about it xmas day when he open the over size package. This is really not a watch that if your worried about the fact it might not work next one should bay it.
2,Very small watch and hard to read,I got this for my husband and he doens't like it. He finds it hard to read because of the dark background and very small for a man's watch.
5,"Great watch for kids, not only men","This watch just fits on my 10 year old son's wrist. Mind you, he's a skinny boy so to find something that looks this good and fits him, is very difficult. It's a great buy!"
3,Misrepresented Color,"This is a nice watch as far as I can tell. I ordered it because I was really drawn to the color in the photo, a light to mid brown band with a light gray watch. However, when the watch arrived the band was a very dark brown, almost a burgundy, and the watch itself a very dark gray and black. Amazon was very efficient in replacing it; unfortunately, they replaced it with the same wrong color. My rating is influenced by my disappointment over the color; so far the watch works fine."
5,Great Inexpensive Watch,"I love this watch and this is the third one I have purchased. They do seem to last for a few years and die, but despite that, I still love 'em. It has multiple functions: timekeeping in two time zones, stop watch, countdown timer and an alarm. With the press of a button, the face illuminates so you can read it at night. Once you learn the controls, it's easy to use. As you can tell from my repeat purchases, I think it's a real value."
4,Great Looking Watch with Flaws,"This watch looks great (except for the weird circular inset). Seems to keep decent time. Love the (mostly) leather band, except that it is too short for average wrists. Other annoyances: the day/date readout is too small. Precious LCD screen space is taken up by a useless barber shop-type scroll bar at top. The auto-light function doesn't stay set. Otherwise, very nice watch.Update: After 2 years, I'm forced to get a second one of these. My nephew has taken mine, claiming it is perfect for his needs. Seems only fair that I get the newer one, although the battery is still strong on the 1st one."
5,Great Watch,"Tis is a fantastic Sports and sporty watch. I purchased this to replace the exact same watch that I've had for many years. The older watch is still functional but, the leather portion is a LITTLE worn and I still have it t and use to when I do outside work. Highly, highly recommend, especially for the price. If you bought retail this would cost 2.5X as much!"
5,Loved Ian Hunter,"Ian's one of those heros you wished would literally come to life and be your own hero! What I wouldn't give to have this guy!! It's almost embarrassing, but I so often think about Ian, desperately wishing for him to be mine, I sometimes want to cry. I quite understand the attraction Ian drew from all who knew him. Tristen deeply loved Ian and while reading this book, you could feel the love Ian had for her. Even during their difficult times, there was never a doubt that this brave Marine officer loved her unconditionally."
1,The 20-4-50 Way... to go broke fast,"This book is total nonsense. Yes, folding a lot of hands at the beginning is boring. The reason all the top players and good books advise you do so is because it's correct, if your goal is winning money. This is especially important for relatively new players to understand.This book is not just useless to help you improve - it is misleading and likely even harmful for most players. Stick with the concensus best books on the topic: ""Hold'em Poker"" by David Sklansky, ""Winning Low-Limit Hold'em"" by Lee Jones, and the new ""Small Stakes Hold'em Poker"" by Miller, Sklansky, and Malmuth.Or just buy this book, play your garbage hands with confidence, and watch your bankroll shrink."
2,"IMPERIALSIT TWADDLE, CYNICAL AND UNINSPIRING!","While the Rough Guide to Turkey is definitely useful in terms of practical information, I could not help but get sick of its jaded cynical attitude about the wonderful country I was travelling in. So sick was I of feeling like the raj on an imperialist jaunt that I tossed the book into the Black Sea.....also there was no information on Turkey's rich architectural and artistic traditions in its appendix which would have aided my appreciation of the sights."
5,The best guide book possible,"The Rough Guide to Turkey is extremely comprehensive and fun. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Turkey, not only to those who will be visiting."
1,Rough Guide to Turkey,"I enjoyed my Rough Guide to Turkey but will not be taking it with me to Turkey. because I am absolutely furious with the production of the guide. I have the fourth edition published June 2000 and the book is in bits. Pages 255 to 260 - 275 to 280- have come adrift other pages I have taped and others are ready to fall out. I bought the guide new. I therefore would not recommend Rough Guide to Turkey to anyone even though the actual format is good. I am making sure all my friends know about this shoddy production. I would happily post my copy to the Rough Guide Team, though I be very surprised if my copy is the only one suffering this defect."
1,Do not under any circumstances buy this book,"This is an awful book. It does not have any transportation information. The closes it comes is listing where the bus and train stations are in a city. It does not have any information about what routes are serviced, how long they take, how much they are or when they leave. When there are two or more bus stations it does not have anything about which station to go to. It also is devoid of any hints or feelings one way or another. There is no ""Take the train for the nice view"" or ""Take the bus because the train is awfully slow"" It is simply not there.For a ""rough guide"" to Turkey I found this book completely lacking. I feel this book is mistitled as it is unlike its companion guides and is ill suited for the task.The history sections are also rather confusing and not up to the usual Rough Guide standard.I may never buy Rough Guide again."
1,no yogurt,"yogurt rhymes with -ert, right?not according to this book. you are better off buying the kindergarten cops' album ""once upon a rhyme""Larry"
2,A really fine artist taken advantage of,"This CD shows how a promising young singer can hurt his career with poor music selection. While it is true that ""all music was new once"" it is also true that not all new music is good. Once it has been given a fair hearing, a listener can justly conclude that it might not be worth playing or downloading. For a singer, the burden of selection is greater. Not only must the performer decide if the music is good but also if the music is suitable for his or her voice.Ned Rorem is an eminently forgettable composer with no apparent understanding of the human voice. Brian Asawa makes the best of this poor material but the results are mostly dismal, sometimes dipping to painful. The only reason to get this recording is that there is some traditional folk songs added as filler. These show what a fine singer Asawa is."
3,"you get what you pay for,","i paid 50 dollars for this camera from a walgreens. it was confusing at first but easy to figure out. the screen shows images too bright but once you get them onto a photo or computer they seem to look perfect. in good lighting with no flash it takes amazing pictures, but you can't be in the middle of a mild earthquake because it will show traces. i'd pay the extra 100 and get an optical zoom camera but this one is sufficient.."
1,waste of money,"we bought this camera before my son was born and unfortunately his newborn pics are blurred, over time I tweaked it a little and still found the pics are bad, out of focus, blurred, red eye, too light, too dark, you name it. Waste of money if you value your pictures. I am pissed the first year of my son's life is captured by this horrible camera."
5,Great Songs Performed By A Great Band,"In my view, though Peter Tosh composed some great songs, they don't seem to be captured well enough on his studio recordings, even ""Equal Rights"". When I want to enjoy Tosh at his best, I turn to ""Captured Live"" and to this recording. Instrumentally, this is simply amazing- great songs performed by a great band. The only slighty weak point here is the vocals- Tosh's own vocals are quite good, but the backing vocals don't match the harmonies of the Wailers (before or after Tosh's departure)."
5,Peter Tosh the Great,"This is a must have live cd. If you like live music you will love this cd!!!!! As you listen to the cd, you can imagine yourself in the concert. You can hear the crowd cheering in the background after the songs. This version of ""whatcha gonna do"" is the best version of that song I heard so far. This is a must have cd regardless if you like bob marley or peter tosh."
1,AGITPROP,"If it looks like AGITPROP, if it stinks like AGITPROP, it is AGITPROP.Yes, let's all trace the murderous Marxists bloody footprints and sing 'Seremos como el Che', 'We will be [muderers & torturers] like Che'.Please speak with people who fled the Cuban ""paradise""."
5,The Best One So Far!,"I loved this book! It's my favorite of the Plantagenets, so far! It really goes into Edward and Richard, their lives and their relationships, it also has alot of battles and swordplay. Great Book!!!"
3,"A pamphlet, not a book","When I purchased this I didn't realize it's just a pamphlet, not a book. The information in it wasn't earth shattering but for someone new to improving their health it would be a simple set of steps to get moving in the right direction."
5,Very Good Hitch,"The box that the hitch came in was pretty destroyed when it arrived on my porch. The UPS guy wanted me to check to make sure everything was there before he left. Luckily nothing was damaged upon shipment. That is my only gripe about the product... no harm no foul.The hitch took me about an hour to install (mainly because my 4 year old wanted to ""help""). Realistically, it would have taken me between 30 to 45 minutes to install. Everything fit together properly without any problems. The hitch sits well underneath the bumper, so you don't really see it (it gives a nice OEM look). I tow a lawn mower trailer every now and then and it does the job well. I have no complaints!"
3,Primer on Internal Communication,"With sections on e-mail etiquette, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, communication theory, paginating a publication and running meetings, authors Lyn Smith and Pamela Mounter attempt to cover a lot of territory in the field of internal communication. Unfortunately, they end up being overly general and diffuse. In addition, they are oriented toward the United Kingdom, and their language and some of their corporate examples assume that the reader is familiar with events there. So, this book may not be terribly useful for American readers or for those who already have experience in internal corporate communication. We recommend it to anyone who needs a primer on why internal communication is increasingly important in the corporate world."
5,Great book for all levels of users,This book is a good tool for all level of users. There are different approaches to old commands and a discussion of the new features in X3. I have been using Corel for 7 years and found this book enlightening.
2,You get what you pay for,"For the money, this isn't too bad. It does work okay, the screen is clear and decent. It is evident, however, that this is a cheap, low quality item. I got this brand new and as soon as I opened the box and took it out, I noticed the bezel peeling off as I flipped the screen down. The bezel is held to the unit by double sided tape! The plastic casing felt very cheap. This unit is just a monitor, no built in DVD player so I was expecting it to at least be slim but it wasn't. The LED dome lights are really dim. They are not as bright as my factory lights. Most cars, especially foreign cars, have a negative trigger for the dome lights to turn on when opening the door but with this, you can only activate the dome lights with a positive door trigger so that kinda sucks. You'll need a relay to get the dome lights to work when opening the doors. I ended up returning it."
3,Do you like lists?,"Two things pointed me towards this purchase: 1) The Might Magazine people were involved, and 2) it was very, very cheap used. This book doesn't really have much to offer outside of a collection of occasionally funny lists. If you need something light for your coffee table (or bathroom [how cheesy would that be?!?!?!? {and how cheesy is unnecessary punctuation?!?!?!?}]) and you don't care to break the bank, I suppose this would suit your needs."
4,Yarn Till its Gone,"Judith Scott's artwork is pure and beautiful. She wraps objects with yarn until there is no more yarn available. She has a great color sense and you can see the zen nature of her working style in each piece. Artist Fantasico, Outsider Diva"
3,Good for getting a date,"These tapes offer basic instruction in Hebrew. Lots of repetition, but not much progress for four tapes. For somebody with no Hebrew experience, this may be O.K. For somebody with a rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew, say at the level of functioning on a bus in Israel, the tapes aren't very useful. If Pimsleur also produced intermediate and advanced Hebrew tapes, the minimal content would be more acceptable. The tapes stress pronunciation, which is very helpful.There is one segment of the population for which these tapes are ideal: the non Hebrew-speaking male who is trying to get a date with a Hebrew-only speaking female."
3,Factual Error?,"I had been using this book as a research tool for a story I'm writing, and it seems to be pretty useful. However, I found this entry:""Lo. A nickname for Confederate Gen. Lewis A. Addison, a ladies man with a reputation of a Lothario. Gen. John B. Magruder allegedly coined the usage with regard to Addison.""This gave me pause, because I knew that Confederate General Lewis Armistead was also known as ""Lo,"" short for ""Lothario.""Did a bit of poking around, and while I can't find a General Addison anywhere, Lew Armistead's middle name is--Addison. Looks like someone (likely an editor) mixed the names around.While this may seem nitpicking, it does present a problem for anyone using this book as a reference--if this one entry is wrong, are there other entries that are also wrong? So try to double check your information with other sources if historical accuracy is important to you."
4,Very interesting,"This is a good resource for those interested in 19th Century speech, terminology and idiomatic expressions, particularly those associated with the US Civil War. The book lists words or phrases, explains the origin, and often gives an example, as many words and phrases functioned as both nouns and verbs.As a resource for Civil War-era nautical language, this book is excellent.Many of the terms in the book are nautical, which makes this book stand out from other books that relate to Civil War-era language. As I am not a Civil War re-enactor, I am not really qualified to recommend it as a resource for infantry or cavalry use, however, if I was re-enacting as part of the USA or CSA Navy, I would definitely consider this book a must-have."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"For a major album debut, the title of this review says it all...I first heard breathe when a friend of mine nearlcy forced me to listen to a downlaoded mp3, and ten minutes after hearing it, I was in the car to Best Buy to grab a copy of the CD itself.The album is very well done, and almost all the songs are keepers and memorable. The only complaint with the music itself is a rather generic feel it adopts after the 4th track, which is a shame, since the opening ""Velcro Parade"" rocks all the way to the 4th, the single ""Breathe""...if every track sounded as original and powerful as the first four, it would be the CD of the year....as it is, its still one of the best."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"when i first heard ""breathe"" on the radio I was instantly attracted to it. i was hoping the cd would be more like the song. the cd really let me down. upon hearing this album it is very easy to tell that this is a debut album. aside from ""breathe"" and a song like it ""superconnected"", this cd lacks good quality music."
5,Seven Channels Rocks,"This is an awesome album from the new band Seven Channels. Once you hear their hit single ""Breathe,"" you'll be hooked. Every aspect of this album is amazing, from the grinding vocals to the slamin' guitar riffs...You won't be sorry you bought it!"
5,"An awesme new CD, by an awesome new band!","When I heard ""Breathe"" on the radio I immediatly liked it, but I wasn't going to buy a CD based on one song, then several of my friends told me that the album rocked and they were great live. So I saw them, honestly I was blown away, after seeing them live I went the next day and bought the album and IMMEDIATLY loved it. It is an AWESOME album, from the first notes of Velcro Parade to the closing notes of Fluid. My personal favorites off the CD are Electric Voices (which was also on their Velcro Parade EP) it now has a chorus and is wonderful, Breathe (which will ALWAYS be a favorite song), Superconnected (which is just amazing, beautiful and rocking all at the same time) and Fluid (in which Dalton's bass playing REALLY shines). Kevin has such a unique voice that it's impossible to describe, Ben's drums are great and Dallas' guitar riffs and solos are awesome.Buy this CD, that is my advice, buy it now =)"
5,Fletcher Point Driver Points,"Best Buy found for Fletcher Point Driver points. Perhaps because of the Thanksgiving holiday the order was a little slow in getting shipped - but then arrived in good time - once it was shipped. The points could not be found locally and we were out - with a job to finish, which aggravated our wait. Definitely would re-order again."
2,Best of 1976 and 1977,"When I read the advertised product, I could not get enough information about the song content otherwise I would have never bought it. Never heard of half the songs or artists i.e Movie Star by Harpo. Then artists I knew sang songs I never heard of, i.e. Lost in France by Bonnie Tyler. This should never have been advertised ""best of"". I felt ripped off but most of all disappointed."
3,Just What the Title Says,"No more, no less. In other words, the No Security version of ""Memory Motel"" (with guest Dave Matthews singing with Mick and Keith), and a radio edit. This was issued in June 1999, more than 6 months after the NS album, presumably to garner airplay (and hopefully sales for the album) during the Stones' US and UK No Security tours."
4,Very good,"This is certainly one of the best volumes in the Osprey Elite Series. Author David Nicole gives an excellent overview of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman army, without the usual western European bias. The chapters: Origin and evolution of the Janissary corps - Recruitment and training - Ottoman army infantry forces - Uniforms and weaponry - Strategy and tactics - Promotion, pay and morale - Support, services and other duty - Other infantry forces. The book is no easy reading, as David Nicole uses the correct Turkish terms for weapons, army units and the like; but he explains all terms, so with a little bit of effort one can follow his thoughts and learn a lot. The illustrations by Christa Hook are of outstanding quality. The book should even interest readers who are already familiar with the subject."
3,not quite... right?,"This is a great collection, not full of fluff as I feel like many of these types of collections are. However, the CD I received through Amazon is not quite what is listed above - short two songs listed and different continuity."
5,Interesting Read!,This was for my husband who followed Carroll Shelby and he found this to be an interesting read from someone in Shelby's circle.
5,Excellent Reference for All Pilots,"This is the most complete, up to date paragliding book out there. It covers all of the basics in depth, but also has a lot of tips that will be of interest to more advanced pilots. Topics covered include kiting, launching, landing, aerodynamics, meteorology, thermals and cross country flight. In the accompanying DVD, the author, a U.S. Air Force test pilot, demonstrates maneuvers such as stalls, spins, and collapses as well as launching, landing and thermalling. Altogether a great value and excellent reference for pilots of all levels."
5,Marianne's books will touch your heart and soul.,"I'm happy to see that Simon's Family now is translated into English. You will not regret that you read this book! It's as story about survival and transcendence, sacrifice and forgiveness. How to heal, find out who you are.... Marianne's books will touch your heart and soul. Enjoy :-)"
5,A Masterpiece in down to earth wisdom,"This book ranks among the 10 best titles I've ever read. Not particularly because of the narrative which is dang good, but Marianne Frederiksson has a very gentle way of addressing some of the most important aspects of life in a very gentle way. Family relationships, births, deaths, friendship and overarching question of the maning of life. This is done in a very gentle way as the story unreveals, and after a while i found myself equipped with quite a few thoughts which proved very enlightening to my own life. In the strong description of the lifes of the characters, you can't escape the feeling that life is all about love. Giving words to that feeling is not an easy task, but Marianne Frederiksson certainly achieves excactly that. This book made me realize something that I'd long forgotten about, but nevertheless carried along all the way. At the bottom line life is beautyfull and important. Money can't buy you love. Well in this case it can."
2,For women who are bored with Konsalik,"The book disappointed me. It's a book for housewives, without education, who are starting to read something more difficult than Konsalik. The plot is interessing, but Fredriksson leaves the characters very flat. Karin is good, for no apparent reason. The men hate, not just a person, they hate, period. I think she could have done better than this."
4,A book that makes you want to READ!!,Shakespeare Bats Cleanup is a super cute book. A young boy realizes it's okay to enjoy what he truely loves. I reccomend it to all ages. It is very short and easy to comprehend. YAY for reading SHAKESPEARE BATS CLEANUP!!!
4,Book Review,"This book follows the life of a kid at the age of fourteen. He is diagnosed with Mono and is but in bed for the remainder of the school year. He finds a poetry book in his Fathers collection and starts testing his own skills out. He tries Pastoral, using couplets, a sestina, and blank verse to name a few. Koertge formed his character through different kinds of poetry and I believe does and amazing job. After the first few poems you really start seeing this character come to life. I would recommend this book to any reader."
4,Great value tide watch,"In all ways this is a great watch. I only wish the tide graph was a little larger and easier to read. Value for money, its unbeatable!!"
3,Cool but poor light,The Light is a LED on the left side of the screen and is not the typical strong blue background light of other CASIO watches. However is it has 5 alarms and let you know where the north is or the actual moon phase. Is funny for the price.
1,Horrible product,"The watch broke shortly after receiving purchase. Company asked that I return the item with packaging slip but I no longer had such documentation, so I was left with it..."
4,me encanta como le queda,"este fue un regalo de navidad y fue lo que esperaba excelente compra, excelente vendedor responsable y confiable lo recomiendo !!! fue un regalo de navidad a mi papa y quedo encantado"
3,Casio digital yachting watch,Very good value for money digital yachting watch let down by ridiculously small figures on the compass bezel and the alarm indicator. Unfortunately like most of these digital watches it also has a wrist strap that will need replacing for almost the price of a new watch in a couple of years. Dont you wish they would provide an alternative strap such as webbing.
3,"historical relevance, not musical revelation","Considering the circumstances, this early home recording of Hooker, made by cartoonist Gene Deitch, was able to record with decent sound fidelity. However, the hiss and static are noticably omni-present even at low volume levels. But what remains still is Hooker's characteristic style, making this a record for collectors and not the neophyte listener. The songs are mostly traditionals and spirituals. Please note the rating is mostly for sound quality and is not meant to be a criticism of Hooker's musical offering."
2,"Okay, but don't pay full price","This really was a random book, as the title states. It had lots of little quotes and inspiration, but nothing solid to base weight loss on. It was a very quick read, but mostly fluff. If you are looking for something to read when you need a little ""pick me up"" this might be just the book, but if you want something to help you in your battle of the bulge, this isn't it."
5,Definitive Gershwin,This third issue of Gershwin's piano music by Clive Lythgoe is the definitive interpretation of the music.
1,Very easy to break and expensive,"I am stuck with this product because my system is designed to use it. The cover got blown off every year (my water pressure is well-regulated, I believe). And you cannot buy the cover only. Replacing it is not very difficult. However, it is expensive to replace every year. When the cover is blown, the flooding water also causes disaster if nobody is at home.If you are designing a new system, I strongly recommend against this product."
4,Book Analysis,"The main message of this book was to expose the ways corporations are manipulating the public in order to make more money and gain more power which will result in their ability to have more control to manipulate and repeat the cycle. One of the ideas that I found to be valuable was the amount of control that corporations have in the media and influencing the public opinion. The book improved my life because now I see how they are trying to deceive the public. People can use this information to improve the world by learning how they can make their own decisions rather than following what the corporations want you to make. The book was strong in providing information, but some of the ideas weren't explained in a lot of detail, making it hard to understand everything."
1,Incoherent and unreadable,"This isn't a ""book"" in the sense of something you can sit down and read in a coherent fashion. Rather it is a collection of quotes, quips, ""fun facts"" and anecdotes which looks like it was put together by an incompetent graphic artist. The material centers loosely on the theme of ""they're out to brainwash you,"" but the content is so sloppily presented that it's hard to be anything but confused by it. This one is going back to Amazon, and then hopefully into the trash heap where it belongs. GIANT WASTE OF MONEY!!"
2,Regurgitated PR material from business intelligence companies,"First of all, the book's not written by Douglas Rushkoff. He only wrote the foreward.The book doesn't have a lot of useful content. It mostly lists supposed marketing innovations and data mining techniques with large neon graphics (like WIRED magazine circa 1999) and minimal analysis. Its aim seems only to scare you in a conspiratorial tone: you are being watched! your every move is being analyzed!Too bad it accepts the claims of the companies trying to market these surveillance and date mining systems at face value. Without finding out whether they actually work, you are likely just scaring yourself for no reason."
2,Loud...But That's About It,"I owned a Soundmatters unit for about a year before giving up on it. Although it pumped out lots of volume, the dialogue it produced was so muffled that I often couldn't make it out. After a year, the unit began to malfunction, often refusing to turn on. I took that as a cue to switch back to my television's speakers, which actually produce clearer, if quieter and less bass-heavy sound. If you like lots of volume with decent bass, this might satisfy. But if clarity of dialogue matters, skip the Soundmatters."
5,Big sound in a neat little package,"I bought the MAINstage HD based on reviews by other purchasers with a similar situation to mine - having a large flat screen TV begging for a good sound system, albeit one that would work for a relatively small living room. This system is perfect - it's loud without being overwhelming like typical surround sound systems and has a rich, refined sound. The built-in subwoofer provides good bass. And with its small size, it sits perfectly on the TV stand right in from of the TV screen. Granted, a virtual surround system has its shortcomings when compared to true surround sound, but it fits my needs perfectly."
1,High Frequency Noise,I got this and it worked ok for a few months. Now I get a high-frequency noise whenever it is switched on and hence it is unusable. Not worth the price.
3,Not Worth The Price,"My expectations were high for this product. When it arrived, it was packaged very nicely. The box is reusable and very durable. The quality of the sound did not live up to my expectations. I expected more separation in the surround mode, and bass response on par with a Bose Wave Radio. But it wasn't quite up to Bose standards. Hopefully I can get most of my money back on eBay. I'm thinking the Yamaha YSPs are a similar product, but sound much better, they cost more too."
2,Too many twists and turns,"Heard the taped version of RED LEAVES by Paullina Simons, a moderately interesting story of four Dartmouth College seniors . . . I enjoyed the college locale and the Dartmouth setting seemed realistic . . . but after a beginning that held my interest, the story became somewhat convoluted and not overly believable . . . the many twists and turns, designed to hold my interest, instead had me wondering out loud as to their basis . . . there was no way they could have been predicted, and to me, that's not playing fair . . . also, the only person I cared about was killed far too early into the tale . . . the narrator, Sandra Burr, was fine for some characters . . . but for some others, I actually found her reading to be harsh."
3,a struggle which almost turned out to be worth it.,"I received this book as a gift, i had never heard of the author and i admit, i probably would not have bought it myself, had i picked it up in the bookshop and read the synopsis on the back cover. I found it to be very irritating to begin with, giving alot of unnecessary attention to redundant detail, i didn't enjoy the style of writing at all. But as i got into it (it took me a week to finish it) i did warm to Kristina and the story behind it and was eager to read on to findout what happens. However I found the ending to be bitterly disappointing. I thought the developments in the characters occurred too late to make it credible and only served to make the writer look like she was rushing to finish the story."
2,I've read better!,"I found this book to be very disappointing! I almost put it down and didn't finish it at all, but read on just to find out who the killer was. I got VERY frustrated with the characters of this book, that each of them had seen Kristina's dead body in the snow and did not say a word to the police and just went on with their Thanksgiving vacation! I found that to be very unrealistic and from that point on the story went south for me."
2,Rip-off?,"With Red Leaves, Paullina Simons tries to be Donna Tartt but sadly fails.The story had potential but it was weak. Simons seemed to lack confidence in herself as a writer.As a movie of the Week script it fairs quite well, with Tiffany Amber Thiessen as the lead and Grant Show as Spencer.One thing is for sure - Donna Tartt she aint!"
2,quite a boring read,this book starts out with some promise but seems to develop into a predictible and rather cumbersome plot I found the characters to be shallow and uninteresting but having said that I did find the authors style of writing to be enjoyable. A second rate secret history
3,It is an intriguing tale of denial and ultimately betrayal.,Red Leaves is a good book for entertaining away a slow weekend or while waiting on your flight. It is by no means a classic but it does pass fair. The setting of the book is interesting but the characters are flat for my taste. The story gets off to a good start and you do at least want to know what happens just like with your daily soaps. I will give it two out of four stars.
3,"Interesting, subtly chilling and thoroughly entertaining","As most students reading books for their final English Studies I wished to get through this book as quickly as possible...and yet once started I could not put it down. It has pace and Simmons' has created thoroughly believable and recognisable characters. The lead, Spencer Patrick O'Malley, creates in himself such a sense of sympathy that it is impossible not to to relate to him and indeed the rest of the characters follow suit. Yet of all the good points of this novel the finest would have to be the ending - for in what has become a world of cliched happy endings Simmons' has instead granted us a glance into the darkest side of the human spirit."
2,So-so,"I liked the fact that, for the first half of the book, the reader is inside the mind of the character we know (according to the book jacket) is going to die-- a very unusual touch for a book in this genre, I think. After Kristina dies, though, it drags big time. I saw the Big Shocking Twist coming about 100 pages ahead of time, and a lot of the characters and events just seemed really fake. The ending was a letdown, too.BUT I read it quickly, and it certainly kept my attention. Not a great book, but it is one you won't be able to put down... on a rainy day."
5,"Great suspense, with a great twist","Paullina Simons delivers a tense, suspenseful story, full of dark undertones and nice plot twists. We meet Kristina and get to know her before her untimely death, helping the reader connect and care about why she was murdered. You feel the frustration and sadness right along with Spencer, the lead detective, as he tries to unravel the lies, half-truths, and explosive surprises that tremor below the surface of Ivy League Dartmouth College."
1,Seller Misrepresents This Item,"The seller is misrepresenting this product. The Wright VBG115PB LocksetWright Products VBG115PB Accents Serenade Surface Lockset, Polished Brassdisplay on Amazon shows a keyset and deadbolt, the item sent did not have the keyset deadbolt and was a nickel finish. As this door latch was a replacement the item sent is of no use to me and will not cover the previous holes for the deadbolt if I attempt to use. I emailed the seller and have received no response. I will seek a refund. I do not recommend this product or this seller based on their misrepresentation and lack of response."
1,Not as shown,"The item shown is supposed to have a seperate keyed deadbolt.It would have been a direct replacement for what I currently have. When I received it, it only is a door latch. It does not have a seperate keyed deadbolt which means you cannot lock it from the outside. Extremely dissapointed and will be returning it at MY COST even though the picture and discription is not correct and misleading."
1,"Looks good, but horrible Customer Service","This product is heavy and looks to be of very good quality. However I had an issue and it took 4 phone calls to Customer Service (the locksmith) with no returned call or resolution for me to return the product. I was transfered to the knowledge expert 2 times after being told that the person is at the desk and that they will resolve the issue. The call went to voice mail. 4 messages with no response. Good luck if you buy it, you are on your own.The funny thing is that it states all over the packaging and directions to call for help. Yeah funny!!!"
5,A Steal for the Price!!,These insulated coveralls are a steal for the price! The deep red color can be seen great in snowy conditions.
1,Total trash! What were these bands thinking?,"This ""tribute"" album is total trash, just like the one-line summary says. The no-name death metal bands who recorded these songs obviously intended to butcher them. I mean, come on! Geddy Lee never growled out the lyrics! DO NOT buy this pathetic excuse for a tribute album."
3,red star a rush tribute?,"i think cd is nice not great this cd was the frist cd or tribute to rush i brought this cd because it,s diffrent most will have artists are that like them working man for exmaple had musicans just like them and they try copy them the best way they know how but this cd thesse are death metal on thesse guys new life in thesse songs i like this idea some hard core rush fans don,t won,t anyone to rush i say to thesse fans get a life. This cd some good covers some not covers i discover this cd in high school . I bet shakria were to cover Them none of thesse guys would cry the working man tribute suck most bands will try to sound like them the problem that i have are the people nobody thesse people are i don,t mind this being done but they should get big stars in death metal and i not underground metal fan . death metal or tharsh metal i but like this idea . it,s better than working man i konw would some disargge."
1,RU30 Kidding?,Ok am I being punk'd here? These bands can't be serious. I've been a Rush fan my hole life. I can appreciate different styles of music. This dics is gargage!!! I wouldn't even use it for a drink coaster. Save your money.
1,I hope Rush hasn't heard this,"I am a Rush fan and I'm also a thrash/death metal fan. Put them together and you have a major disaster. Prototype and Premonition may have a little talent. The rest are a total joke. If they were gonna use death metal bands to cover Rush songs, why not pick some of the better bands like Athiest, Obliveon, or even Cradle Of Filth. The bands on this cd can't even play their instruments right. The bands that does Tom Sawyer plays the wrong notes. Please don't disgrace Rush by buying this awful joke of a tribute."
2,I think I'm going bald,"Wow. I've been inspired not only to review, but buy this album - by the previous reviews (I've currently only heard certain tracks - from napster, and a friends' compilation MD). In fact I was just crying about Jacobs' Ladder. Seb Bach on vocals! - I'm sure he'd never heard of Rush until he needed extra work. These are the most interesting reviews I've ever seen on Amazon - and yes - I may buy this now, just for the amusement value. It annoys me when JB sings like that guy from n'sync though. Death metallers covering Rush - Interesting concept - seriously - but terrible execution. Wish me luck - I don't want to have to tear my hair out. One last comment - Geddy mate - I think you were reviewing the wrong album!"
1,Are you kidding????,"I can't believe Rush sanctioned this project. I thought that Working Man was bad, but this is a complete waste. Different strokes for different folks."
1,Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?,"What the...?!? This record is 100% trash. How could Rush allow such garbage to be released? Give me a break. If you must have a Rush tribute album, in the name of all that's sane in the world, buy ""Working Man"" and NOT this filth."
1,Rush and death metal music does not mix well,"Are these bands making fun of Rush? If you want to hear Rush songs, why not just listen to Rush play them? Don't buy this lame tribute cd. These bands are thrash metal and death metal. If you don't like that kind of music you will not like this cd. If you're a Rush fan, chances are you'll be offended by this cd. If you just have to hear a Rush tribute, by the ""Working Man"" cd instead. That one has some musicians that have some sort of stuff called.....talent. You won't find that on the ""Red Star"" tribute."
3,If you like death metal it's very cool,"I like the version of spirit of the radio, by Premonition The vocals were very unique! I also thought the drums on the opening track of anthem were out standing! If you like thrash or death metal and like rush, this is a good cd. If you dont like Metal you wouldn't understand it."
3,Believe it or not...,"I've been a Rush fan since 1982. When the first vocals of Engrave Speed Death's version of ""Anthem"" hit me I thought, ""Oh my god, what have I bought?"" However, by and large I enjoyed the MUSIC of this album quite a bit. The vocals are another matter entirely (hence the rating). In fact, those of ""Red Barchetta"" and ""The Spirit of Radio"" I found quite affective. (And although I may catch flack for this I enjoyed Capital 2's ""Tears"" better than the original!) Worth at least a listen."
2,Should I laugh or should I cry?,"The cd only can be meant as a joke on Rush fans. The bands featured on this ""tribute"" are not very talented and the sound is muddy. I wonder how Rush could give their o.k. for this album, which is really hard to swallow for their devoted following. But somehow it's funny to listen how Rush's fine songs are pulled through the mincer, isn't it? It comes closer to the idea of a tribute album than ""Working Man"" did. Rush's other tribute album was just trying to duplicate their songs, while ""Red Star"" brings some new interpretations. However, if you liked grindcore/death metal, this album could appeal to you. All in all, you shouldn't take this release seriously, but all of us Rush fans are bored stiff with cheesy tribute albums. We keep waiting for some VITAL SIGNS from Rush themselves!"
3,Laughable,"It's so bad its funny. Thats why I gave it 3 stars. It's really a good bit of comedy, it really gives Weird Al a run for his money. I laughed out loud, but really, don't waste your money."
1,This is an insult to Rush!,"Oh please! Who wants to hear Rush in this sad state? I am a bassist, Rush is my one and only inspiration, and I am sickened by this junk. Are these Rush fans, or jokers trying to make us sick to our stomachs? When I ever heard Temples...uuuuugh.Well, gotta go, I have to make myself sane once again by listening to the real stuff. But Free Will was nice!"
1,WOW,"I've got to tell you that I hardly recognized these songs as RUSH tunes. These bands are certainly keeping the songs alive, but not for long. These covers are HORRIBLE!!!!!"
1,BUY THE REAL RUSH ALBUMS NOT THIS TRASH,"Why is there a need to release ""tribute"" albums? Most of them stink and Red Star is no exception. This is nothing but a whole mockery of one of the most talented and accomplished groups of all time. Not too many bands are accomplished enough to match (or even come close) the pure talent of Rush. These bands on Red Star are not even the same style and are nowhere in the same league. Do yourself a favor- buy the real thing not this garbage if you want to hear an extreme legend."
1,This is disgusting...,"It suprises me that anyone (or band) who has been ""inspired"" by Rush is capable of creating such an atrocity. More than that, can any person who appreciates the range of musical and human expression found in a single measure of Rush music truly incline themselves to listen to this? This makes me very sad; I have wept.Andreas Leverkuhn, aka: Hans Castorp"
3,Dud,"Electronica is reaching a strange space in marketing: ""anything that doesn't fit into another genre, stick it in electronica."" This should be in Jazz, not electronica or dance music. Unfortunately Jazz purists would cough this up faster than a furball with the occaisional drum machine, sporadic synthesizer and godforbid sampling. But as an electronica fan, if I wanted Jazz, I'd buy quality Jazz, not this filler. I suspect every penny was scratched together in trying to secure a license from Tosca, the one ""name"" on the CD. I prefer unknown artists, I love nu-jazz, jazz/electronica/fusion but this just bores me to tears. Some trip-hop elements, but nowhere near Thievery Corp for example. Although hard to find, what they may have been trying to do here is copy ""Science Fiction Jazz"" from Germany's Compost Label, composed by Minus 8, just excellent. But this; cool name, cool idea for an album, bad CD."
3,Keebler Ready graham crust,"I am very happy with the schedule of delivery, the reminders and, of course, the subscribe and save price. My only issues are that because these are graham cracker crusts, sometimes I don't get a cautious warehouse packaging person or a cautious delivery driver. I have receive crusts cracked and/or broken and pie tins bent. Please help with this issue!!!"
4,A few contenders,"25 listings but only a few 'contenders'. Most titles I had never heard of, but they are catchy. The best are Oh, Julie (Sammy Salvo) an excellent version of the Crescendos hit. Soul Dance (Tommy Leonetti) you need to be on the dance floor for this one to 'hit' you. Midnight Oil (Charlie Blackwell), Ein Ganzes Leben Lang (I Can't Stop Loving You) Ivo Robic, and Floyd Cramer's Hot Pepper are good. Cramer's intrumental, 'Sweetie Baby' needs to be released. Liner notes are also needed. Good memories!"
2,tiresome,"I thought ""Silver Pigs"" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius."
2,Flush the Bathhouse,"It is hard to imagine a mystery bad enough to not get five stars from #1. The only redeeming feature of A Body in the Bathhouse, for me, was its description of the construction of the Roman Palace at Fishbourne. Because my ignorance of the site is near total, the details that bored other readers were more interesting to me than the characters or the plot.Too many sub-plots, too many pat soluctions, too much cutesy family stuff, too much Benny Hill potty humor, too much wrong word-usage (ex-patriot for expatriate), and too much British slang from the lips of Romans."
5,"Great Coffee Table Book And Even Better ""Making Of"" Story","The photos in this book are beautiful (print quality wise, one must take into account that many were taken 30 years ago). The story of how they came about and what Kevin Kelly experienced while creating it are even more important/impressive. It's worth searching the Internet for ""Asia Grace"" and reading through the website."
3,Beautiful book but frustrating,"This is an absolutely gorgeous book but I found it quite frustrating. I have it on my coffee table and love to look through it but am confused by why the publisher did not include a single description of where the pictures are taken. I travel a lot and many of the images appear to be of places that are 'trip-worthy'...however, there is no way to know where they are.If you just love beautiful photos of exotic places and people, get this book. If you want to get a book to decide where to travel in Asia, look elsewhere."
1,Delivery and Packaging,"I finally received my order after many weeks more than usual yesterday and am completely disappointed. The book arrived in a very sorry state and I am extremely shocked and angry. This book is a very expensive book and I had been waiting and looking forward to receiving it. However, it arrived simply inside a soft bubble-wrap postal pack with no protective covering around the book. This is a heavy hard cover book. It should have been boxed at the very least! The paper cover of the book is totally ruined and the book itself has been completely ripped from its hardcover and the corners of the book are all bent. I had intended to keep this book as a display coffee table book but it is no state for that use. The distributor has offered me a 20% refund - on a book of this cost and the condition it is in, this is ridiculous. I will think twice about ordering a valuable book like this online next time."
4,A Unique & Worthwhile Look at DPRK Terrorism,"This book is really unparalleled in terms of documentation and comprehension. Bermudez neatly addresses the subject by covering DPRK activities by country, rather than by method (bombings, kidnappings, assassinations, etc.) This makes the book coherent and easy to read. It is also good for students who need to do a last-minute term paper on the subject. (I recommend such students go back and read the book cover to cover, however.)The book suffers from rather poor editing, however, as another reviewer has already stated. But that is forgivable. Bermudez is the unofficial encyclopedia of North Korea's military and security forces. His writing for Jane's Intelligence and his other published books make him a scholar with value.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the DPRK."
1,"Good Books, BUT WATCH OUT ! The CD doesn't run on W98 !,",". This set of 2 books and a CD is beautifully done. It's a solid course and a fair reference too. The glossary and index are professionally done. Even the physical size of the 2 books is nice.BUT WATCH OUT ! AND I MEAN B E W A R E !The Microsoft CAMCORDER program that presents the interactive course demos and examples DOES NOT RUN on Windows 98, and it probably doesn't run on anything higher that Windows 95.After 7 phone calls to them, Microsoft failed to get the CD to run on Windows 98. Microsoft's ""Second Level Technical Support"" has actually admitted to me that they dropped W-95's CAMCORDER.EXE support in W-98. They just really don't like to talk about it. So, if you want to use the CD to see the examples, then run it on Windows 95. I had to rebuild a W-95 system just to view the CD."
5,Greatest book about flying saucers,"The amazing Projekt Saucer books are the most fascinating story ever writen about flying saucers. The whole story consist in five books : Book 1 INCEPTION (1991), Book 2 PHOENIX (1995), Book 3 GENESIS (1980), Book 4 MILLENIUM (1995), Book 5 RESURRECTION (1999). Just like George Lucas, Harbinson wrote Eposide 3 first, in 1980, and then the others. If you want to read just one book, read this one, GENESIS. Those books are quite hard to find, but they are all available on website. These five books, representing about 3000 pages written over 20 years are a must-read foranyone interested in flying saucers."
1,This book needs proof reading!,"I have read this book twice in the past, both times in paperback verssion. I loved it! I recently bought it for my Kindle and was very disappointed when I began reading it. It is obvious the publisher only used a spell check program on the book and didn't have someone actually read it. Dropped words. Repeated words. Wrong words (can you say autocorrect?).All of these errors are very distracting and break the flow of the story when you have to try to figure out what word is missing, or what the word should really be.Did I mention I am only on chapter 4?I am very disappointed in the quality of this book."
4,Interesting Take on UFO's,"I enjoyed the concept of UFO's originating on earth. Harbinson pieces together an interesting assortment of facts into what becomes a believable story. Having read Inception and Phoenix first there was a lot of duplication but since Genesis was written first, that was ok. If I had not read those first, then all that detail would be necessary."
5,THE touchstone for works in the UFO genre.,"Having read this book almost a decade ago, I was recently struck by the similarities between events in the book to the popular TV show, The X-Files. I found my old paperback copy of this book (now quite dog-eared) and re-read it. What a ride! Harbinson has written a a meticulous, spellbinding - and absolutely credible - treatment of UFO phenomena, the Men in Black, and government coverup. A must read for anyone interested in UFO conspiracy theories."
4,Mindbending UFO novel about the worlds biggest conspircy,Had The Germans created UFOs or is there one sinister mastermind behind all UFOs. A super compelling novel based on documented occurences across the globe. Follow the story of a hardened UFO believer and his young companion investigate a slew of clues leading to the unbelievable ending that leaves many current questions answered.
5,perfect,"When I received it it did not work but they sent me out a new one right away, no hassles. Great Seller"
1,Not a good book for any age,"This is a book that is bad all the way through. spelling, grammer, plot, story line, character developement, the list goes on and on.The only good thing about this book is that it is a wonderful example for bad writing.I do NOT advise reading this book."
4,Good story...Bad spelling,"This was a great book with a good plot. Readers could be distracted from the story as the spelling, grammer, ect. is bad. How ever, by the third chapter, you will get used to it. A classic fantasy, you will enjoy following the twins, Aran and Arsa.I do not recomend this book for small children, because by the end, it has a 17 year old getting married and giving birth.If you liked Eragon, you will like this book."
2,Not the best,"I thought that it had a generic fantasy plot, but it had some creative elements. It was simmilar to many contemporary fantasy books, so if you liked Eragon or something simmilkar, I guess you would probaly like it at least a little bit. One thing I did not like was that the charecters and settings seemed flat and unrealistic, and I didn't realy care about them. One unitentionaly funny part of the whole book is the spelling, punctuation, and some grammer, but this coald be looked over if you were into the story."
2,Bad spelling,"Wow! I'm 95 pages into the story, and there are already 230 mistakes! The plot is pretty mediocre, with the sterotypical lost heirs of a great empiore, evil villian, magical powers, one-sided batlles, the hometown getting destroyed by the forces of evill... the cliche`s are countless. It does have some creative elements, though."
4,Good resource,"Nice selection of fonts and a very thourough manual. A bit complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, quite helpful for making handwriting worksheets."
5,Great Product,The product was great! I was able to have the same teacher fonts on my home computer as I do on the computer at school. It was delivered in an adequate time frame. I am enjoying using the fonts to create documents for school.
3,A little too slinky...,"I mistakenly bought these, but a buyer should know that the G string is NOT wound. I bought the same Ernie Ball 80/20's with the wound G with an little E of 12 (live and learn). Those sound great."
3,String quality and tone,I am a new guitarist but a musician of 15 years. I tried these strings out just to get a good idea of what other strings my sound like compared to the elixir brand. In my experience I have found elixir to have the best tone as well as longevity. The tone of these strings for my fender acoustic electric was a significant drop in quality. The tone is mediocre with the g string having a very metallic sound.
3,Shoe is narrow,"The shoe is beautiful and very soft, but the sizing seems a bit off. They are a bit too long (moves up and down on the heel) and narrow for the size."
5,Great speaker stand bundle,"This is a nice quality speaker stand bundle. I only wish the speaker cords could plug in to my speakers. They have a large different size plug than my 1/4 inch plugs, so I have to use my old cables."
2,Not Heavy-Duty,I put my Yamaha S115V on these and the stands are very stressed. The lightest touch to the speaker makes the stand sway back and forth. My speaker stands also came with 2 speakon cables and one of them was bad. I thought I had blown one of my amp channels. Pyle's name speaks for itself...its a pile of crap. There is nothing heavy-duty about these stands.
1,Ripped Bag,"When I received this product there was a hole in the box and in the bag that came with it. First I tried emailing the company with no answer. I then called the company and the person answered the phone:Company ""Hello""Me: ""Is this Pile Pro?""Company: ""Ya, what do you need?""Me: ..explained my problemCompany: ""I need to transfer you...""They hung up....I called back and got the same person and she yelled at me saying she couldn't do anything and that I need to be transfered...she transfered me and the line disconnected again...I will never buy something from them again...and I hope you don't either... terrible customer service"
3,disappointed by purchase,"Prospective buyers should be aware that this book is only 6"" x 6"" in size and has only 8 pages. The original price is 5.98 (found on back cover). I paid 19.99 for it and expected to receive a large size book for that price. No false advertising, but imp't info left out!"
5,"Beautiful, Eye-Catching, Stunning!!!","While the story is great for little ones, the illustrations are most FASCINATING!!!! My 2-year old daughter absolutely LOVES the pictures in this book. Beautifully done. Highly recommended!!!!"
4,Great read,I read this when I was about five or so years ago. I'm one of those people that gives up on books very easily but the Books of Fell had me hooked from the beginning. The last book wasn't as intriguing as the first two.
4,A helpful tool.,If you are just begining to use an airbrush this book is a must have. I bought the book before my airbrush gun and the book helped get me the proper equipment and techniques to use it properly. I have since turned off the T.V. and created beutiful memories.
4,Not too bad!,"I would recommend this book to anybody new to air brushing. While some content may be redundant to an experienced user, there's still a lot of good info there. You can't go wrong for the price!"
5,Excellent book of inspiration,"I received this book when I was first diagnosed with cancer. The book was truly inspirational, and not just because of Delores'strength and family support during treatment but also during all the challenges God threw her way after her battle with cancer. I just wanted to write and say how much I enjoyed the book (I read it twice)."
3,"Too Early, Too Late","Previous to the fist two compilation in this three set of hits, I recommend you do not purchase this compilation so soon because of the lack of history this 2-cd greatest hits has and its argument whether these songs should of been released so soon. While most of the songs do come from her late discography varied by nothing great but minimal presence of mariachi and more pop oriented themes including the highly anticipated tango disc, it is best to buy the original recordings than volume 3. Coming up, new Mariachi cd including her daughter's debut disc. For the best, stick to the first two volumes. Sound: A- Music: C+"
4,Loved this CD,"I really loved this CD of Italian Lounge Music. I had heard about it when it was reviewed by Marco Worman on the ""The World"" on Public Radio International. Some of the songs are instrumental only, some are in Italian, some in Spanish and some in English. The opening song ""Jackie sings her pain"" will have you turning up the volume and singing along. I would recommend this for anyone who has a taste for things with a more Latin/Mediterranean sound."
5,Great product,"This is a great multifunction machine at a great price. I took the free shipping option and was willing to wait, but received it in 2 days any way. Very pleased."
1,Discontinued because it sucks,"I just thought I would write a simple review on how terrible this product is. As others have said, it won't print black if the colors are empty, which it conveniently empties everyday even when powered off."
2,Glad to get rid of it.,"I sqeezed the life out of this as long as I could. I'm tired of false paper jam messages, having to remove the back cover just to make the message go away. no printing because the machine thinks the cover is open, figuring out that if I wedge a piece of paper inside, the open cover message won't come on. I'm tired of having to remove the paper tray because constant reinsertion finally causes the ink cover to open which eventually has to be taped closed because the machine won't print with it open. I'm tired of it printing in green only even though all the colors are inside. It had one great feature though. I could buy ink for it on ebay for a couple dollars. It delivered me one last fatal error message that said not in so many words that it needed to be opened up and fixed so I said goodbye, it boarded the next dumpster and we parted ways."
2,Too many little issues,"At first, i really enjoyed the printer. The print quality was great for the price, even the photo prints came out very nice. But after a few months, the small problems became apparent. It frequently says that an ink cartridge is low or empty, even after I replaced them all, and didn't use the printer for a awhile. That is bad enough by itself, but it makes it worse because if one cartridge is empty you can't do anything else. If Cyan is empty, you cant print , even if you are only printing something in black/white. I changed the settings on my computer and pressed the button for black/white on the printer, but it just keeps beeping and showing that Cyan is empty. This is very annoying because i don't print that often, so whenever I do need to, it says something is empty, and I am stuck. This has happened the last 4 times I tried to print something."
1,Works poorly with its own cartridges; configuration issues,"Frequently thinks cartridges are out of ink or missing when they're not. I wasted a lot of money on cartridges before giving up. For example, I just replaced the black cartridge, and then it said the yellow cartridge was missing even though I didn't touch the yellow.Configuration is not for amateurs; requires some manual configuration of computer names and IP addresses for some features to work, and you may have problems if the computer is on WiFi and the printer is on Ethernet."
2,Ink Hog,"I've had this MFC for a couple of years. It works well enough for color printing and scanning.Unfortunately, it consumes ink standing still -- even powered down. You have to unplug it to prevent it from going through automatic cleaning cycles. Ink prices for this unit have nearly tripled since the initial purchase. Finally, it won't print black when a color cartridge is empty, and it won't scan or fax when any of the cartridges are empty.This is an inferior product."
3,Not as good as advertised,"OK-So I actually based my decision to purchase this MFC printer on reviews I found on this site. I found it quite easy to set up and my Vista program had no trouble connecting. The issue I have with it is the color quality. All the reviews I read said the print and color quality was very good to excellent. My color appears washed out aqnd the blues are practically non existant. I've tried to print images with vibrant blues and purples that have come out muddy browns and greens. The reds and yellows have appeared as washed out and faded. I haven't performed any in depth trouble shooting yet, and it may be an adjustable problem. But, I am rather disappointed to date."
4,Very good printer if you know how to work it,"I have been using this printer for last 8-10 months. My experiences:1)When I first purchased, I use to switch on-off the printer after every use. Original ink came with the printer got depleted very soon because of this. After putting new ink I leave my printer on always and never shut it down. Now my ink runs for months.I usually choose the option of 'Normal' quality when printing if the output is not for presentation purposes.2)Initial setup was a bit pain connecting to router et al..and I am a network engineer by profession.But since then it has been very smooth ride and is very dependable.I would certainly recommend this."
2,Ink cartridge logevity issue,"I bought this printer about a month ago. I've printed less than 6 8.5x11 color photos and the ink cartridge is already generating a warning that it is low on ink. My printer was purchased new at Best Buy.Just a warning: it seems a good printer, but the cartridges are going to be an issue for most owners."
2,Great Multifunction - Many flaws,"Great Multifunction. Easy network setup. My two pet-peevs:1) Default setting is the fax. It really aught to be the copier. C'mon Brother.2) The paper tray. I've removed it twice. Once when I got it, the second time when I refilled it. That time it was very difficult. This time I broke the tray trying to remove it. I can't even get the whole tray out. Arrrgh!"
5,UNBEATABLE PERFORMANCE FOR THE PRICE,"The MFC-440CN is the best investment in printers that I've ever made. You won't find a better multi-function networking all-in-one for the price, and I couldn't ask for better quality and performance. Having always had problems attempting to share printers using the Windows share function, this product is a dream."
2,Cheap and Disposable,"Magenta print head is clogged and is uneconomical to repair(cost $85 from Brother). The service center wants $100 just to look at it. They don't even sell service manuals, and even if I were to replace the part myself I'm better off with new printer.Brother Ink is obnoxiously expensive and you have to replace it at least twice a year, or risk clogging the print heads(they suggest 6 month intervals). Generic ink is a risk, if the print heads clog because of it you have a doorstop with no warranty. A lot if ink is wasted during cleaning and b&w; printing uses the colors.Ink cost as much the cartridges that contain print heads. I will never buy a printer with an ink tank system again. The three color cartridges with a tiny quantity of ink cost almost $40, this is more than an HP or lexmark cartridge with a printhead.Two stars because I can use it as as a greyscale printer(until that clogs) and fax/scanner."
1,Print cartridges are only good for 6 months used or not,I just installed one of these for a friend and in the instructions Brother tells you that you must use the cartridge before the expiration date on the cartridge package or six months after you place it into the machine.This means that if the machine has been on the store's shelf for a while your will have to replace the cartridge before it is empty.This also means that you should not purchase additional cartridges so that you can quickly replace the cartridge when it is empty because your backup cartridge also has at least the same expiration date.I would not buy this for anyone that might run into this cartridge expiration issue during a crisis such as getting out a term paper for college or a business offer or presentation at the last minute. You know how things go - it will expire exactly when you need it the most!!!!I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT....
1,very poor service,never recieved printer seller would never contact me after 4 emails Do not oreder from this company they are a rip off company i am suprised Amazon has them on their web site . mkes you thank about Amazon themself?Brother MFC-440CN Photo Color All-in-One Printer with Networking
5,best product,"Good machinates of fax, very efficient rapid I can escaniar ducumentos and them file, screen to color that illustrate images"
5,Brother MFC-440CN All-In-One is perfect for me,"This all-in-one printer, copier, fax, and scanner is just right for me. The quality of the print is great, the speed is fine, and it is quiet. I just discovered that I can set up my fax speed dials from my computer. No more punching in the numbers on the machine. It's much quicker! I can also plug my camera memory chip right into the front of it and print pictures in seconds. It it also quite stylish in brushed silver and black. It has a digital window that lays flat or tilts up. This is a nice feature because I can tell a distance when it is receiving. This is my second Brother; I just really like the quality. I don't see how you can beat it for $116."
4,so far so good,i've printed a couple of photos on this thing already as well as having used the copy function and just printing regular old stuff. i'm very happy with the printer. i've got it hooked up via a cat 5 cable into my router and all my computers in the house can print via the network. the setup was seamless. great product!
5,Best Surprise I Have Heard This Year,"I bought this based on some postings of people raving about this album so I decided to take a chance. This is soooooooo great! I am so glad I chanced this one! The previous reviewer is right this is beautiful McCartney pop.Emitt Rhodes also has to get a mention as a kindred spirit. If you like Emitt Rhodes, I PROMISE you will like this album! Wow, wow and wow!"
4,Like watching the final act of Hamlet.,"Raise The Red Lantern has three stories, each twice as depressing and twisted as the last. Sad stories of lust, greed, treachery, sex, drugs, death and so much more. Yet what we really have is the last scene, the final act, the beginning of the end. All the major events, the important decisions, have already happened. All we have left to do is watch as the end comes. Like, as I pointed out, watching the final act of Hamlet. We can see what is going to happen, from the well to the suicides to the murders. Yet this can't be a tragedy because there is no strong willed, good hearted Hero to fail. Everybody is flawed and is doomed from the start. Kind of like watching a train crossing a bridge that is out of order. There is nothing left for it to do but fall into the river taking everybody with it."
3,Not as pictured.,"The product was decent, but it did not come as pictured. There is a clear window instead of the padding that is shown. I am keeping it, but I'm not happy that the picture did not represent what I received."
3,Great product and great price but missing promised dealer buttons!,"This product is great except that it doesn't include the 6 dealer buttons as promised by the product description on the website. For that alone, I took 2 stars off."
4,Guaranteed kill for fans of this Southern steamroller...,"Simply stated, these guys don't disappoint. For those who havn't heard these guys yet, I'll lazily describe them as Eyehategod with epilepsy. For those who havn't heard Eyehategod, please go buy their albums first (both bands share a guitar player, so he won't mind). Compared to the last album, this has a lot more groove, but I still can't for the life of me differentiate one song from the other-just one glorious headf*&k. Man, I love this s&*t. Worth the wait, and once again adorned with the usual outstanding artwork. Yes kids, Relapse has more than ONE amazing band..."
5,The GD Mighty Soilent Green,"From car accidents to a band members murder, not to mention the whole Hurricane Katrina disaster Soilent Green are a band that by all rationale should not exist. However, these guys have overcome adversity in its many different forms and are still primed and ready to kick your a$$. ""Confrontation"" finds the band at the top of their game, not only pumping out their trademark bluesy grind with unreal musical precision but experimenting with different sounds as well. From jazz on ""Liquor & Cigarettes"" to a down home Southern acoustic number with ""Another Cheap Brand of Luck"". If this is your first time hearing of Soilent Green, ""Confrontation"" is as good a place to start as any. If you ever get the chance to see them live, by all means DO IT!!!!! Not only do they put on a punishing set but they are a great group of guys to talk to. ALL HAIL!!!!"
3,"Some letters in this book are good for the soul, but...","...as a responsible pet owner, I find it very difficult to empathize with those letter-writers whose pets died accidentally (left outside and hit by car while owner went inside and continued getting ready to go to work) or (missing/lost) the three-month-old kitten who never returned (owner and kitten moved into a strange house one day, and the very next day the owner put the kitten outside to ""explore"" while owner went to work all day). Both owners expressed their grief, but both losses could have been prevented if the owners had acted responsibly. Of course, both stories just broke my heart as I am an animal lover and caretaker of 4 pets. But animals like cats and dogs are often like children -- you can't just let them wander about on their own. They look to you, their owner, to look out for them because they can't. I expected a book of letters from responsible pet owners who really knew how to take care of their pets."
2,NOT a dump cart,"Overall quality is good, but definitely not a dump cart. I bought this to haul behind the ATV to pick up manure and the last thing I want to do after shoveling it into the cart is to have to shovel it out. My husband had to put a different latch on it because the original did not hold up. Nothing worse than going down the lane and having the damn thing let go with a full load. He also raised it up on the frame 4 inches so it would dump better. It helped, but the scoop design on the back just holds everything in unless I back it up so the thing hangs over a hill.It may work for firewood and other general chores, but it is not at all user friendly around a farm being used for what I bought it for."
3,difficult to dump,Very good construction and will haul heavy loads. Problem is it will not dump the load cleanly!
3,Playing is not that great,"The sound is very goodUnfortunately, the playing of Mountain's best known songs like Mississippi Queen, Never in my life, Theme for an imaginary western etc is horrible (as compared to other live albums such as Flowers of Evil & The Road goes on Forever)To quote Leslie West on the interview included in this cd, ""Felix (Pappalardi) must of sold us some bad coke that night"".The only reason I could see someone buying this cd is to hear previously non live songs like You better believe, Get out of my life woman and Its for you - which quite well played.I agree with past reviews that Felix's bass is barely audible and Leslie West's guitar playing in between the pure sweet simple tone of the early 70's and his dry heavy metal tone of the mid 80's"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,In the interview with Leslie West which concludes this disc he tells us that this 1974 concert marked the first time that original line up of the band (minus the keyboard player) had played together since breaking up 4 years before. This is apparent throughout as everybody plays badly.There is nothing about this disc which would justify the purchase price. The performance is terrible and the recording mediocre. So little care was taken in its production that the West interview just cuts off in mid sentence.
4,What happened to Felix!,"If you Like Leslie West or Corky Lang you'll love this CD, cuz you can only HEAR Leslie or Corky. You can kinda-sorta hear Felix fuzzing along at the bottom, but not that much, and apparently there's a rythym guitar player, but I didn't know he was there at all until they introduced him.Felix is in pretty good voice, tho! It's really great to hear him singing Nantucket Sleighride again!I'd still recommend buying this CD even tho you can't here Felix - cuz NObody plays guitar like Leslie West, and he's in fine form here! And the version of Nantucket Sleighride is one of the best I've heard on disc.One esoteric bit of info is you can kinda hear Leslie changing from the 70's style of guitar he played with ""classic mountain"" to the 90's style of ""leslie west"" solo you hear on his CDs now on afew of the songs, it's pretty darned cool!"
2,bad quality,"While nice in appearance, it had many quality problems. On my first trip the front clasp broke completely.I think this is a design defect. I don't recommend it to anyone unless the design defect is corrected."
5,"nice, mellow and funky","Louge-y, funky, jazzy house music. Very British. If you like stuff from NakedMusic recordings or HedKandi stuff (sort of the retro-disco house) you will probably like this one. Some songs are on the lounge-y side, nice to listen to late at night, working and some songs are disco-driven house with a nice beat but not so super-repetitive or energetic. 12 tracks on this: Wind and Sea, Clan Greco-Rotation , House Fusion, Galaxy Angel, Special Love, Disco People, Ever Gonna Make It, Legato, Acoustic Food, Happy Prive, Can We Live, Psycho Rhodes."
3,"Good, but not THAT good","A good read, however I found this book somewhat tedious in parts. One of two novels that inspired Irwin Allen's blockbuster disaster movie ""The Towering Inferno"", I saw the movie before I read the book, and it doesn't live up to what I expected. Not quite as hard hitting as I would have liked, the technical details are well written, but it lacks a punch elsewhere."
1,LETTERMAN-GREATEST MOVIE HITS,Very disappointed with this new CD by the Lettermen!There are way too many solos.....we know they each have great voices but it is their collective harmony that has made them so popular and now they put out a CD with way too many solos and much too little harmony.(and the backup orchestra is also too loud.)I have most all of their previous recordings but this was the only time I have been unhappy......wish I could trade it for ANY of their other CD's. (Most of my collection is in LP)
4,Wa-hoo!,As close as it gets. Has the yodel from Second Chance Lions. Favorite cut is the John Deere Tractor Song.
3,"Rolling Stone from Texas, Don Walser","I was hoping the whole album would be similiar to the songs: "" Rolling Stone from Texas, Cowpoke, & Down at the Cantina."" Those three songs are powerful demonstrations of Don Walser's dynamic yodeling skills and powerful voice. I would recommed the album because of those 3 songs."
5,Love it !!!!,This is a fun feel good CD. Loved it!!! This is a good travelling CD for us when we are going down the road in our RV.
3,INSTALLATION TO POWER SOURCE,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT I'M SURE BUT FOR ONE CATCH...YOU HAVE TO HARD WIRE THE CB RADIO TO THE AUTO'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM YOURSELF. PERHAPS NOT A PROBLEM FOR SOME BUT FOR OTHERS (MYSELF INCLUDED)IT IS I AM SURE. IT IS MY FAULT THAT I DID NOT NOTICE THIS IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION PRIOR TO ODERING. I JUST WANTED A CB RADIO THAT I COULD PLUG INTO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER AND GO. THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE OF CB UNIT. FOR THIS REASON ALONE I RETURNED THE UNIT TO AMAZON.COM SO NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE CB ITSELF ....JUST BE AWARE THAT ONE HAS TO WIRE THE UNIT TO THE AUTO AND NOT JUST PLUG INTO A LIGHTER....
1,Really disappointing.,"I had two of these units from Amazon with the same identical problem. The channel selector turned and clicked but did not change the channel. I also own the Midland 77-092, which is actually a cheaper model, but I've not had any problems with it, and am completely satisfied. You may want to consider that model from Amazon instead of the 77-104XL."
1,broken within 5 weeks,So much for this commercial machine being tough and dependable. Bought mine new through Amazon 5 weeks ago and it shut off during routine blending. Now I have to send it in for repair at my own expense. Absolutely unacceptable.
2,Vita-Prep 3 broken 15 months later,"My Vita-Prep 3 broken after 15 months doing the same heavy Acai smothies I make daily. I guess I used the machine a lot and pushed it, but I'm not doing anything different. I guess it does wear out so be aware. To repair it will be almost $200 with shipping + labor and parts they say are normal wear and tear (e.g... the rubber base also became loose). Anyway, I loved it until this week. I thought I had bought a tank. Not the case."
4,Get into the What behind the everyday strife,"Get ready for insight into the world of people around you.This book is a start into seeing why people act the way they do. Be careful not to label... just use it as a tool and you will find great reward in this plie of information.Why is it that your employee, boss, co-worker acts the way they do? Pick up this book. Get informed."
4,An entertaining book.,"I take classes and am amazed when instructors read all of us in the class. I then buy these books and find them fascinating too, and realize that the only way to learn how to read people, understand them and do what is taught in these books... is to interact with people. Unless you are in a job or routinely in social situations... taking what these books offer and implementing it... is a bit more challenging. That said, i thought this book was a pretty good read."
3,Enjoyable Reading,I like the book. It's enjoyable and amusing reading. I like the part that each section is not too long so it keeps reader attention so reader does not get bored with the lenghty context. The authors did a good job incooperated amusing examples.
3,Beware - you have now been labeled.,"I'm an ISFJ. If you work in cooperate America, perhaps you have heard someone say this of themselves? Oh yes, your name and personality have now been condensed into 4 letters.This is a fun book to casually read - like your horoscope in the newspaper. Beware though - MBTI zealots are everywhere. I have actually known people who have not gotten jobs based on their ""type""Maybe George Orwell was correct?"
2,Please Understand Me is better,David Keisey's book is a mult-million best seller for over 20 years. These descriptions do not have as nearly as much depth. David portrays the types from a much better perspective. I understand that this is work application but Keirsey's are much better.
3,I disagree,I believe that I must disagree with the two reviews about these type descriptions. Keirsey's type descriptions cover more issues and don't necessarily focus on centering the descriptions around the four letters. I think that these are the reason why Keirsey's are so much more valuable as a reference to psychological type users.
3,New Annie Lennox Bio Fascinating Yet Too Familiar,"This interesting book incorporates re-treads of old newspaper and magazine articles and even actual biographies. Sometimes word-for-word plagiarism of fan websites is inserted. While the book does offer some new tidbits, one can only wonder as to the accuracy of the information after such blatant copying of pre-existing information. It is interesting to note that reviewers of the authors' past biographies have noticed similar behaviors. Having said that, it is an interesting read and hard to put down at times. Occasionally, the authors give us too much information (do we really need a name and description of every single instructor at every institute of learning that Annie attended?). In a nutshell, if you're a Eurythmics or Annie Lennox fan, you will have to have it. For everyone else, it serves as a good introduction to Annie's persona; however, take it with a grain of salt."
2,Buffering .... Buffering and More Buffering,Hmm think maybe there was buffering? 14 More Words Required? Well then ...Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering Buffering. 14 and then Some!
1,Don't waster your time or money,Everything Fast had to say could have been done in about three chapters instead of eleven. Most of what he said could be figured out just by going through life everyday. There was really no significant information on nonverbal communication and what it actually means.
1,Not worth it,Boring. Sadly i realized at half of the book that i was wasting my time. Outdated. I won't even finish it. I'm on my way to get another book on body language.
2,find another,"I've never actually seen someone publish a quote with the ""N"" word in it, until I read this book. There are lot's of great things to quote and great people to quote throughout history, and he chose to use a quote with a racial slur inside. It reflects poorly on himself even if he was not the quotee.one of the chapters on seduction is truly awful. If you're looking for a book on seduction do not use this method, it's sleezy and there are other methods that respect women more (surprisingly) It involves violating her personal space, and confronting her fears. It's just plain not right.This book does not provide adequate description of what might mean what. Even though he does explain that it's not just about body movements, it still feels incomplete.OVERALL; it's a pretty lousy book. find something with better reviews"
2,It's about men,"The author tends to assume that women and men send identical messages with identical or very similar body language. That's a mistake.Young women with career goals might find it useful to learn some of the male territorial and hierarchic signals described here. For example there's a hilarious passage about men challenging each other's territory on a restaurant table using only the instruments at hand. Next time I lunch with a man I'll notice how he lines up his fork, and try not to laugh.Women (networks, team players, verbal) and men (hierarchies, power lunchers, spacial) operate differently and use different body language to communicate different signals. Most of the time only the male signals are visible to this author, so the book's value is limited.The publisher does a disservice by not making this clear on the cover."
2,Misleading and outdated,"Take a look at the cover of this book. I guarantee that, should you make the mistake of buying the book, by the time you finish reading it, you will be no closer to deciphering the meaning of the body position of the woman on the front cover.This book has about as much useful information as a magazine article, all couched in a patronizing and poorly written format. Look elsewhere."
2,Contradictive,"I didn't like the personal insight mixed with contradictive statements. I did get a little out of it, but was dissapointed in the total content."
3,"Thorough, but very outdated.",I'd much prefer Alan and Barbara Pease's current and up to date book Body Language.
2,Confusing,"According to the book,one position may mean two opposite things at the same time. So I didn't learn anything from this book. It was way too It was way too confusing. It was not what I expected."
2,Not worth money,I did not get much from this book. It is very general and does not teach you the art of body language. It only tells you a few good points. Most of the books is useless in your future life.
2,Don't bother with this book,"Simply said, this book is far too general to be of any use. It makes the case that there is such a thing as body language, and that it can be read, and that it is very useful, but it does not teach you anything on how to read body language. If I were you I wouldn't bother reading this book."
2,Too old for academic use.,"Taking into account the cultural climate change, you'll quickly realized just how dated this book has become. I wouldn't recommend this book if your seriously planning on studying the subject. Most of the theorems has since been proven wrong. The book even makes use of the word 'square' to describe what today would be called a dork."
2,Not as good as other titles on the subject,"After reading three books on the general subject of body language, including ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Pease, ""What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People"" by Navarro, and this book, I can say that this book did nothing to enhance my understanding of the subject matter. The other two books are worthwhile. This book is slightly too vague and general to be of any practical use. Taken together with other books on the subject, it adds nothing of value."
1,Just like Politics,"This book was totally lack-luster and just as full of contradiction as Beltway politics. I should hope that his revised version is a better read and more definitive. I didn't realize this book had been written so long ago. It is my hope that the newer version has a better understanding of the sciences and is less about waffling--let's save those for breakfast. In short save the few bucks. There was nothing in this book that the average person couldn't figure out on their own. If you like answers that all of a sudden become questions, then perhaps you should click 'add to cart'."
3,Probably not what you're looking for,"I'll agree with most of the other reviewers and presume you are looking for a book that gives guidelines for reading meaning from movement and non-verbal cues. This book is more of a sociological study than that, and the insights it offers are the ones that have by now already worked their way into the culture. It's very honest and doesn't promise mind-reading affects based on the angle of a glance, and it is well written if dry. Still, this probably won't be that beneficial to the average person looking for information to sharpen their social skills."
3,Vague and basic,"Most of what is described in this book can be found in almostany issue of Sport Rider magazine. You'd be better off spending your money on a subscription to that mag than buying this book. Very little information is given on the actual procedures and their vagaries on the GSX-R; there is light coverage of who to decide what to do, good converage of certain available products, and little information on procedures, installation, and tuning, as well as the benefits you could expect.I was more than a little disappointed."
5,Adorable little hat!,"This is the cutest, softest baby hat. The label on the front of the hat is absolutely adorable."
4,cute cap,"Love the logo, but haven't yet been able to use it on my newborn (cap is a little too big still)"
4,existentialist detective novel,"I would recommend reading the ""Amsterdam Cops"" series of novels in order to get the full benefit of the developing characters over time. However, each is also perfectly fine to read on its own. The main characters are quirky, fallible, deeply human and lovable. Their adventures verge on the absurd and they spend a lot of time in musing over the meaning of life or discussing zen philosophy. The author's style is far from dry however and his peculiar sense of humour liven up the tale. This novel is set in an imaginary location in Maine, in the US, and his descriptions of the landscape and culture are spot on. Most of the others in the series are set in Amsterdam, and offer great insights into the Dutch way of life."
5,Running is life.,"The stories in ""Sole Sisters"" demonstrated a hidden dimension of life that is revealed through running- unshakable relationships formed with running buddies, self confidence discovered through training and kicking that 5K in the butt, and dissolving problems with each step along the trails.We can all learn from these stories. Everyone, not only runners, should read this gem of a book."
4,neat,"Well, i have to say i like Raventhrones newer CD, but this one is awesome too. The only thing I dislike about this band is that the guitars suck. The guitars fit the atmosphere, but I wouldn't have minded some shredding in that atmosphere. I love the keyboards and the vocals, which are the highlight of this band. The drums are ok, they could have fitted the music a little more, but they were fairly complex and fast.I think the band creates beautiful music along with awesome intense music, so if you like beautiful intense music, then this is a great buy."
5,"Maso, Kahlo, and a cigarette","This work adds to Maso's reputation as one of the most significant writers today. As Maso has suggested in the past, why are less known artists ignored in media, at the expense of well-known writers. Hopefully, this smart, beautifully engaging, and funny text will introduce a new audience to two influential and important artists."
3,Hard to read without previous Kahlo experience,"I must admit I'm not very familiar with Frida Kahlo's work, have never read anything about her, and am only vaguely aware of who she was and what she represented. With that background - or lack of one - I found this poetry difficult to follow. I'm sure it would mean more to someone who is already a fan."
5,This book willl leave you pumped for more! You need it!,"Car chases and bullets fly through the pages of this book! Its like a John Woo movie on paper! Oh, car chases CAN be done in comic! AND BEWARE: you will buy the next installment!"
4,Good googles,"The picture shows a bunch of goggles and it only comes with one pair so don;t be expecting that and I'm not sure if the color changes or not, but the ones I got were red with blak lenses."
2,"Beware - This Is Not The Ronettes, Darlene Love, et al.","This is a so-called ""tribute"" album by unknown artists on the K-tel label from Britain. They attempt to sound like the groups produced by Phil Spector on his Christmas Album. They actually do a decent job, and I won't throw it away, but I might give it away."
5,runaway reptar,"hey , the kids love it, great imagination, keeps them happy and most importantly QUIET..say no more"
3,Could have been better,It seems like WWE really wasn't paying too much attention to the quality of the matches they put on this DVD. I pretty much watch Smackdown every week and it by far has better in ring action than RAW. This DVD however doesn't really capture that IMO. Some of the matches are squash matches and some are very sloppy. I think from now on I'm gonna start making my own best of through out the year and see how it compares to their releases. If you are gonna release a best of set try and really make it a best of.
5,A toy that really grows with your child,"We have found this to be an awesome toy for our son. When we first got it, he was around 7 - 8 months and just liked taking the cups and pieces out. As he got older, he enjoyed putting them back together. Then, he really got into the shape-sorting part of the toy. Now that he is almost two, he still plays with it all the time, stacking it to form a tower or playing with the cups in the bath. I feel like we really got our money's worth with this toy. It's also nice to know that it's not made in China. For those who have concerns regarding the size of the pieces, this was never an issue for us, but my son was not that big on putting things into his mouth."
2,Great idea design flaw,"I think this type of toy is great for children 12 months to 2 years. This particular toy though is not safe for those little ones who still put lots of things in their mouths. Our little one could easily put the shapes to be sorted in her mouth (the entire shape) I felt they were a choking hazard, sent them back and ordered the Nest and Stack Buckets from Amazon. Same idea, but I am much happier since the pieces are larger (It also turned out to be cheaper and just as cute!)."
1,Bottom of the List,"I couldn't read more than 45 pages into this book. It is definitely the very bottom of my list. It's really an unpleasantly dull story and quite depressing if you happen to know anyone who is epileptic. I would not spend more than 25 cents on this at a garage sale. As an educator (including writing instruction), I would probably review this to students as what not to do. I agree with some of the points the writer has re: the fine line between fact and fiction in memoir--but that doesn't sell the book for me. Don't bother with this one."
2,disappointing,"I expected much more from such a highly hyped book. The postmodern sheen (am I lying right now? is it possible to tell the truth in memoir) is very thin, and after about 15 pages, glib to a tiresome degree; an essay would have captured it better than this feverishly overwritten and smug performance. Underneath the surface of the fiction about epilepsy you can just see the more complicated story of an eating disorder; writing about *that* would have been far more absorbing, would have enabled Slater to delve into the real psychological preoccupations & complex family relationships that underlie that particular illness--the symptoms would have been more in sych, anorexia in particular is a much better metaphor than epilepsy for the emotions displayed here--and her questions about how possible it is to tell an honest story about oneself would have had more power. Skip this."
4,Beautiful Story!,"I had to read this book for a class I'm taking in college -- I'm reviewing children's books. It was actually nominated in 1997-1998 for a ""Show Me Reader"" award.... it is a local award in the state of Missouri. The language and writing style is rich and varied. The book has beautiful illustratios. Text and illustrations are well integrated. I highly recommend it!"
2,Needs more work..,"Wasn't impressed at all with Dewalt's answer to the Osbourne EB-3.The fit and finish was not up to Dewalt's usual standards. Think they rushed this into production. I couldn't get the rocking of the fence adjusted out..Dewalt says its normal. If you are cutting precise miters, ya sure don't want the fence rocking around while going thru the saw. Also the presets won't stay preset. They will vary as much as 1-2 degrees each time you move the slide. I have the Dewalt 746 table saw and wanted to stay with Dewalt equipment if I could, but after a couple days of messin with this miter gauge I took it back and ordered an Osborne EB-3(seperate review)."
2,SubPar Design,"The problem I have found with this is that none of the fasteners are loctited so I had to pull it apart and lock them all.and the stops built into the slide are not even close to the callouts on the slides e.g. I thought I was cutting at 90deg and I was actually cutting at 85deg. My fault for not checking the setup ahead of time, but thats why I bought this so I can just set it and cut."
5,Really helpful,I am trying to learn all I can about the universe. This is a really great manual to help in my studies.
5,New education,"Books like Narc Ops should be introduced into university classrooms. Kids constantly study: where law comes from, how law is applied, and who was involved in bringing law to the United States without ever actually looking at the real jobs done by law enforcement officers, narcotics officers, and correctional officers. This book really lets you see the inside of crime from those individuals that dedicate their lives to stopping it."
2,Ok i guess.......... when they aren't broken,"They broke pretty quickly on me. I just needed these as beater earphones yet they didn't serve me for more than 6 months. Highs are a little too loud. Bass is strong and doesn't rumble too much, tight enough. Mids are ok. Pretty comfortable. Buy the V-Moda ""Bass Freqs"" instead."
5,Best ab video ever!!,"Comprehensive, difficult ab workout that works! You can pick from 7 different roughly 20min workouts. Check out the clips on youtube under ""Cathe Friedrich ab circuits"". You wont regret this, but you will feel the pain!"
5,great way to top off a workout,I really like Cathe's videos and am pleased with the Ab Circuits DVD. I sometimes use one of the ab workouts on the dvd after my upper/lower body workout. I have a couple friends that come over and workout with me. We are middle aged but have been working out for about 10 yrs. The exercises on the dvd are excellent. I especially like the one with the medicine ball and bonus partner routine. I struggle with the weights and plates routine as it is very challenging. I would recommend this video to anyone that is looking for a quick ab routine or one to do at the end of your upper/lower body work out or cardio. It would have been nice for there to have been a stretch segment on the dvd but since there's not I just stretch on my own.
4,Blood Alley,"This is a true John Wayne classic. It shows a group of chinese citizens that want a better life. There is a ""family"" amongst them that supress the desires of the village. They are tyrants. Onece gone, these innocent people pull together and get their little pattle wheeling boat to Hong Kong. Yes ""Baby"" is there for John Wayne, but when Lauen Becall takes care of ""baby"" John Wayne is one happy camper."
2,ONE disk only,"I do not like two sided DVD's, and the description said number of disks =2. So I waisted my money, because I now must choose only one to watch. My DVD player is a Sony's 400 disk player, You load it, and watch movies with out having to handle the disk and its case every time. Less handling less chance of damage. Amazon DON'T give inaccurate and misleading descriptions!"
2,"Great potential but disappointing ""read""","This book is more of a long brochure than it is a book that you sit down and read. The concept is brillant and I will admit that I had really high expectations for it, so maybe I was destined to be disappointed from the start...This book hardly takes any time to get through and I did laugh out loud a few different times when I was able to picture people from my gym acting like the ones mentioned in the text. My reactions and thoughts are very similar to the author's in a few instances when it comes to working out, but I did get annoyed with her constant whining and repeated observations throughout the text. This book is a slightly amusing, mindless read...IF you go to a gym. I can't imagine reading it if you don't and certainly wouldn't recommend that you pay full price for it no matter what."
4,"Open, honest, real. What we all feel, but don't say aloud.","It's difficult to read a book by someone you know personally and remain objective. I made it a point to remain so during my read. Sam Fulwood represents a growing segment of the American populace. His book speaks for many of us who belong to the segment, but who cannot express as eloquently what we feel as he did in his memoir. There were areas where I felt he could have been MORE vocal, more expressive, but overall, there are things that all Black Americans can learn from his experiences interacting with White America. The chapter on South Africa is by far the best to me. I wanted to catch the first plane to Johanesburg. For those who don't know Sam, it's a slow read, but it builds nicely to it's conclusion. For those of us who know Sam, it's worth a second read. Savor it the second time around."
3,Too many subplots,I have read all of the MD Falco books. This is not one of the better ones. There are too many subplots going on and the main thread just wasn't compelling enough. In general I enjoy this series but this was lame compared to some of the others. I got a little bored with it.
5,Hooray for Lindsey Davis !,"""Three Hands in the Fountain"" is another excellent book from Lindsey Davis. The spate of body parts appearing in Rome's water systems is of course a job for Falco, and we are taken on a fascinating journey through the sewers and aqueducts of Rome, as well as to the countrysdie in the quest for the killers. As usual, Davis is entertaining and informative, and this book is recommended to historians as well as mystery lovers. Steven Saylor is another excellent author who deals with Rome in an earlier period, although his books have less of a popular mystery appeal.The subtle shift in Anacrites' role through this series is worth noting - and those who haven't yet read ""Two for the Lions"" have a further treat in store !"
4,"Fast-Paced and Fun, but Clue-less","Well, mostly clueless. You won't be able to play armchair sleuth, figuring it out as Falco goes along, because of the dearth of clues. The villain is introduced late, not long before he is apprehended, and Falco more or less stumbles upon the truth rather than sleuthing it out. Also, the villain's m.o. seemed a bit implausible, as if engineered to allow the author to give us a tour of the entire water system. (Why dump parts of bodies in one place, and other parts elsewhere?) On the plus side, it's nice to have Falco back in Rome, and this book seemed more focused, with fewer wordy digressions, than other books in the series."
3,Didius falco goes soapy.,"Ok. I cheated. My loving spouse brought this back for me from Australia where it's already in paperback. In this one, Didius Falco deals with domestic strife (his, his in-laws', and buddy Petro's) and a serial killer whose victims' body parts keep ending up in Rome's water system. Highly entertaining, but I wish that Davis would have introduced the killer earlier in the book and developed the character a little more fully. A red herring or two and a couple of alternate suspects would have been nice, too. In some ways, it was almost as if the killer and his motives were an ""oh, yeah"" after the soap suds. Will I go back to Davis' Rome? You bet. Looking forward to ""Two for the Lions""."
4,Advance reading,"Living in Hong Kong has a few advantages, one of which is access to the UK release of the latest M Didius Falco novel. A serial killer is loose and body parts are showing up in strange places. Petronius is acting strange, Helena's brothers are causing problems, and Falco is now under the spell of two women. Just another day at the office.This book makes for enjoyable reading, though Falco seems to have lost some of his Sam Spade toughness. However, this latest effort is much better than 'Last Act' and is a reminder that human nature (and human evil) hasn't changed much since Rome. Falco is back."
5,Super Value CB Radio,"I have one of these in my car, and it works extremely well. With a MIC gain and RF gain that is adjustable, you can punch through loud and clear. The display is easy to read, and in outhern California I can pick up three weather channels. The memory channels are an added feature, but be sure to hook up all three wires or the channels will not be saved in memory. The lock feature is a plus, to avoid unwanted setting changes. Just get the best antenna you can to go with this great mobile radio and you're good to go. A super value for a super radio!"
1,It Sucks,Since I have had this unit it works only when it wants to. I have had it into several CB shops and they all say the same thing. It Sucks. STAY AWAY from this unit.
2,Skip it,"Don't get sucked in by the cute picture on the front cover. I expected more back story about the character, but was disappointed by the formula writing. Skip the book, go read some fanfiction. Trust me, it will be more entertaining."
4,Not 50 inches...,The screen is not 50 inches wide. There are black borders (1 3/16 inch) on each side of the matte white screen so the screen you're buying is actually only 47.625 inches wide.Other than that the screen is great. It comes with a ball and string to attach to the projector handle for easy reach/pulling. The backside of the screen is also completely black and there's a plastic smell to the projector screen when you first take it out of the box. Also keep in mind that this projector does not come with a mounting kit.
4,I got what I paid for.,"This projector has a bright white screen, perfect for watching film/TV. The screen has been up since the day I received it in the mail. Only issue I had is the screen won't easily roll all the way back up. I've been keeping the screen pulled all the way down, so that I don't have to deal with this issue. Overall it was a good investment."
3,Good device,"That's a good bluetooth device, good power and length reception. I'm use it with my PDA (Palm TX) and headsets Motorola S9, it and works excellent. the only thing I don't like it is I can't forward or back to another track or use pause mode. Only volume control. That's wired...."
3,"pairs easly, but sound quality not great","I have had this transmiter for about a year. A month ago, the plastic on/off switch broke off and exposed the internal metal switch. I used a pen to push the metal switch on and off. Since I don't have the invoice, I paid $15 shipping and handling + postage to have it repaired.Overall, it works well. The sound output isn't high (loudness and quality). When I work out in the gym, I have to set both my media player and my Motorola S9 headphone to maximum volume. When I use my Motorola S9 with my bluetooth-enabled phone (without the Zoom), the sound quality is much better."
1,Re-Makes From Start To End,"I don't know whether the 5 stars awarded by another reviewer is due to not being old enough to recall the original Little Richard hits, or simply because that person finds each selection enjoyable on its own merits.If the latter - well - that's the reviewer's prerogative. If, on the other hand, it's based on the belief that they ARE the original versions, I have to burst his bubble by pointing out they are re-makes.Like Bill Haley & His Comets, there seems to be a glut on the market of re-done Little Richard stuff which, if that's OK with a buyer, no problem. After all, there are no original versions around of Mozart playing his best pieces [or even re-makes, come to think of it]. But when an outfit tries to pass off a compilation as his best, without informing you they are not the original versions - that's a no-no.There ARE better Little Richard CDs available and these are suitably reviewed as such."
4,Wonderful mystery,"Ms. Harris starts to hit her stride with her ""formula"" Our main character puts the clues together and this books moves forward with each chapter - no wasted time!If you like a good mystery with a heroine who doesn't know it all, but must put the clues together - you'll enjoy this one."
1,Boring!!,"I read 7 chapters and then just couldn't take it any more. This book is boring, boring, boring. Not much else I can say. Boring!"
4,as always a good read from Charlaine Harris,a good mystery and a good story for anyone who loves suspenseful books - it moves a good clip so no chance of losing interest
2,Not sweet nor deadly,"It had no plot, I expected a lot more from such a great writer. I kept waiting for it to get good. It didn't."
2,2 1/2 stars shows real promise as a first dectective story,Better than average for the detective story genre but not outstanding. Catherine Scott Linton the heroine is a well developed character but the rest are spear carriers. The plot is good with a nice twist. Over all a decent read.
1,Drags on and on...,"After reading all but one of the Sookie Stackhouse books, followed by Harper Connelly, I decided to try out more of the Charlaine Harris books at my library. I discovered this was her first and was excited to read it. I am so glad that her writing has improved. This one drags on and on. I did not like Charlotte Linton or any of the other characters. I did not need to know what happened every second she was at the newspaper. I finally stopped reading halfway through. It got to where I didn't care who the murderer was or if Charlotte was still a suspect.Everyone has to have a first book and while the reviews seemed to like it I did not. I guess I'm spoiled with her current books."
3,OK,"This is one of Charlaine Harris' first books - and she's grown as an author since then. I would agree with the other reviewers that if you've never read Harris' books, don't start here. The Sookie Stackhouse books are by far my favorites. If you're a fan of Harris - then this one is worth reading while you're waiting for her next book to come out. I enjoyed the story - the main character is interesting but could have been developed further, I thought. The mystery is a bit rushed at the end - but it works. I'll be looking forward to Ms. Harris' future books."
3,Very good but does not push the envelope,"I thought that Sweet and Deadly was a very nice, easy to read book in which the author keeps the plot going even though nothing much is happening. I would recommend it for q quick, easy read, but don't expect a lot of suspense or a genre-bending twist ending."
4,NOTHING SWEET ABOUT IT!,This is a Charlaine Harris stand-alone mystery (not about vampires). Takes place in Mississippi with Catherine Linton as the main character. Her parents were killed in an auto accident 6 months prior and she has returned to her family home. She works as a society reporter for the local weekly newspaper. She discovers another death and realizes that the two killings are related. More death and intrigue follow.
4,A nice start,"I really stumbled on this book while scanning for new books and ordered it on awhim. It is a nicely written novel, certainly not her best work but an indicationof good things to come. She stumped me totally on the medical mystery and althoughthe ending felt rushed she finished on her own terms. I have read all of hervampire books and they indicate that Ms. Harris is polishing her skills verywell indeed. I will continue to buy her books."
3,It's not what you hoped for!,"If you're thinking, ""Hey, I like her other books, let me try this one!"", don't. It was a very early book for her, and while it's an easy read, it doesn't really go anywhere and feels incomplete. Technically it's a ""murder mystery"", but not one of those ones where you could figure out, if you only put the clues together, the perpetrator. Nope, it's the other kind, where three pages from the end of the book (literally) we learn something new about one character... right before that character tries to kill our protagonist. And then the book ends.Her other books, especially anything with Sookie Stackhouse in it (I'm not as impressed by the Harper Connelly books), are great fun. This isn't."
1,Not worth reading,"Princess Catherine Radziwill's writing was a very early form of tabloid junk that you see today in the cheap papers.She was a very bitter person and took delight in speading gossip about the Imperial family and other royal families of Europe. She was known to have hated the Empress Alexandra with a passion and spead the story of the relationship between Alexandra and Rasputin. The relationship between the two was totally innocent and Alexandra trusted Rasputin with her life but more importantly that of her only son and heir to the throne Tzarevich Alexis. Alexis had haemophilia and rasputin was able to stop the bleeding when nobody else could. So to Alexandra, Rasputin was a man of God. She never saw his darker side and did not believe the police reports that was given to Tzar Nicholas II.Radziwill totally focused on the negative side of Rasputin's character. So avoid this book."
4,A baseball fan's ballpark bible!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a baseball park review book. It is so much more than mere statistics and data, as it gives a fresh personal perspective to each park. I am now more enthused than ever about taking such a trip to all of the baseball parks - but no way in just 38 days like these two enthusiasts did! You will not want to put this book down! Well written and peppered with humor, too."
1,"Before this, I wanted to take my kid to all the ballparks","Before this book, I wanted to take my kid to all the ballparks. But now I am thinking twice.The author does little but whine about everything. His travelmate, the 60s/70s parks, the 80s parks, the 90s parks. The food. The few times he did not get free stuff. The times when he did get free stuff. I suspect that life is always half-empty for the author. And that is not the right person to write about such an event.On second thought, I am going to take my kid to all the ballparks. Just so folks like the author don't spoil it for all of us."
1,There just a bunch of Pansys wining,They wine about how Master Card copied them I want to go to all 30 Major League stadiums with my freind and I would reccommend Joe Mocks guide to Baseball
4,Behind the smoke and mirrors of the media,"This book was purchased for a college English class that combined journalism with traditional English. I was hesitant about reading it at first, thinking it would be a sensationalist book preaching about how everything is a lie and such. In fact, I found that I really enjoyed it. Thankfully void of neither a left nor right wing bias, and all together facts, not opinion. It really makes you think and consider what goes on in the media today. It amazes me how many things news outlets get away with. As Kitty points out, they're in it to make money. I definitely began looking closer at the news after reading this book. It was very interesting, and readable."
5,Excellent Video,"I received this video as a gift. I'm so glad I did. I've done this video twice already. It is very well cued. The instructor's voice is calming and encouraging. The music is relaxing. I really feel my muscles working, but it feels more like releasing tension, not building tension. My muscles felt worked, but warm and relaxed. I am definitely going to keep this is part of my exercise routine. I feel relaxed and calm after the workout. I am in the early part of my pregnancy, so I don't have the aches and pains that come later, but I am hoping that by doing the routine consistently now, maybe I will avoid some of those aches. Overall an excellent video and workout routine."
2,"great workout, poor dvd quality","Loved this workout to begin with but DVD started freezing/skipping after only 2 months. Tried cleaning it with dvd cleaner, that didn't help. I bought a couple other pregnancy workout DVDs but this was my favorite and it was also more expensive than the others. It skips less when I play it on my laptop but impossible to use in either of my two regular dvd players."
5,Perfect Video,This video is wonderful. I was concerned about what type of exercise I would do that would not be too overwhelming considering that I never exercised before the pregnancy. The Tai Chi exercises are very calming and beneficial in reducing back pains and cramping. I feel so alive and refreshed after each session.I would recommend this video to every expecting mother!
5,Romance at its finest.,"It looks like the old saying ""You can't judge a book by its cover"" just went flying out the window. What can I say? Clowns and hot chicks. Hot chicks and clowns. Rubber chickens, squirting flowers and romance.... ahhhh. Romance."
5,The Best Electronica You Have Never Heard,"Disciples of Retro Tech is a great album and a departure from Ben Wa's debut. The first album, Devil Dub, was ominous and down-tempo. The music on DoRT, however, is upbeat, groovy, and has enough funk to stun a yak. Do not let the apparently campy electronic sound fool you at first.You will dance, sing, and snicker while the ""Bad Robot"" does his thing. The solo on ""Binary Mary"" will win you over just in time to tag your territory and bust a move with ""Destroy All Lines"" and ""Krylon Warrior."" Before you know it, ""Automatic Brain"" will let you know that you have been assimilated as a Disciple. You will then listen again and only be more impressed. Finally, regret will surface because you did not buy the album sooner.The details launch DoRT into orbit far, far above most techno you can find. Buy it; your friends will beg to know what is cranking out of the speakers."
1,Not for me,I don't like this book at all. First it's too big - page size. Second the information is a wasted expense. Wish I could get my money back.
2,The Next Fifty Years,"I thought I had ordered the book but it seems the CD was ordered instead. Fortunately the author was kind enough to refund my money but I was very disappointed. After researching what had been the communication problem, the person who was circulating the CD as part of her lecture series was advertising the CD under the book title then stating she was replacing the book with the CD. I personally feel that is an inappropriate way to advertise her product and it should be done separately. I may reorder the book at a later date obviously through a different Amazon distributor."
3,Doubtful results,"I really don't think these pills have any effect on menopausal symptoms. After being on them for over 6 months, then off for 6 months, I notice no difference. Mind you, my symptoms are very mild, but a friend who had sworn by them had a full hysterectomy and then suffered terrible sweats and hot flashes immediately after surgery. The pills were of no help to her. I think money would be better spent on quality vitamin / mineral supplements and getting enough exercise."
4,Liver rite,"It has a bad smell,If you can get past that you will be okay.If it works as good as it smells bad thats a good thing oh by the way I will be ordering it again. Thank you."
4,New user..,"I have only been using this product for several months. My latest liver tests came back almost normal (much better than before). But I must add I also gave up severe alcohol usage, to zero.I am writing this mainly because I can only notice the smell when I get my nose really close to the bottle it came in. I bought it locally, but from now on will be getting it online for a noticeable cost saving."
5,Makes Liver spots disappear in no time!,"This stuff made the liver spots on both of my hands and on my face disappear completely...that isn't even why I got it!Update 1 year later:Our office Admin handed me papers she needed me to sign and was watching me apply my signature to each page. She doesn't particularly like me (or anyone) but she remarked...the skin on your hands has no spots! Looks so young! How old are you? I told her that we we were the same age. Then she went on to show me the spots on her hands and arms. She said she didn't apply sun screen and had gone to her kids games. I really didn't think to tell her about this product. I guess I had forgotten about having taken it. It has been quite awhile but the results sure did last! I think I'll start back,because it must have been doing lots of great things for my general internal health!"
2,Oh the smell!,"Hard to believe no reviewer mentioned the awful smell of this product. I had to hold my breath when I opened the bottle.Also, there is a review about disappearing liver spots. Liver spots have nothing to do with the liver. They are from aging or too much sun.I took a bottle of this. I did not notice any increase in energy. It did seem to help with the volume and firmness of bowel movements. Or that could just be the metamucil I started at the same time."
5,Good experience,"I bought the LIVERAID for a friend. That is not the brand she wanted, but that is the only brand I found online that seems reliable."
1,not good.,I bought three bottles. Two bottles with very near expiry time. The bottom of one bottle seems to be opened before and sealed up by some kind of paper. Another bottle has a crack on the side(not sure whether it happened before delivery or during delivery.
3,Could have been a lot better...,"If Imax is now the best quality available on dvd and Anctartica one of the unexplored wonders of our world, you could expect a visual masterpiece. This isn't. Nevertheless, it's not terrible either. The problem here is the lack of empathy that this documentary brings. Yes, penguins look stunning and glaciers also do the trick, but if you're going to go to a place so hostile, yet so diverse, as Anctartica you should expect more information, more soul put into it and, of course, the magic that other documentaries such as Africa-The Serengeti, Imax-Alaska or The Living Seas display. Buy it only if you want to complete your Imax collection."

2,Very pretty but pretty dull,"Look, I love all things about Antarctica, having visited there as a Coast Guard officer in 1982. I have stood at the South Pole, flew in a helicopter through the Dry Valleys, cavorted with penguins on the sea ice, visited the restored huts of Scott and Shackleton. And yet this DVD bored me. Granted, the cinematography is awesome (well, semi-awesome on a 21 inch screen), and I learned a bit about glaciers. But the reviewers who point to the film's choppiness are spot on. Moreover, the narration is at an annoyingly low volume compared to the rest of the soundtrack. Finally, the romantic elevation of Robert Scott into a great explorer is ahistoric, as Roland Huntsford showed long ago in his book Scott and Amundsen, so the fawning treatment here is inappropriate."
2,Too Short !!!,I love nature doc's. But this milking that IMAX does is driving me nuts. 40 minutes for a nature movie is downright ridiculous. So your telling me on all their movies they can only come up with 40 minutes of nature to film and charge me anywhere from 13 to 25 dollars a pop for it. No thanks.
2,"Great visuals, lacks information content","The footage looks great on a big screen, but unfortunetly the documentary lacks content. There are long sections where the only audio is sound effects and music. I was expecting something more on par with a National Geographic special where I would learn more about Antarctica, penguins, glaciers, etc."
3,Visually stunning but poorly directed,"The film quality is superb, and IMAX fans will not be disappointed in the cinematography. Overall, however, the film is unfocused and lacks purpose and direction. In addition, the music soundtrack and narration is surprisingly annoying. If you are interested in Antarctica, I recommend this film, but you might want to turn the sound off."
1,Ozzfest ROCKS! ...That's if you were at the concert.,"I bought this used...and I didn't like it. The recording of Marilyn Manson was degrading to his previous works because it sounded horrible. I've even heard Slipknot's New Abortion on the production CD, and the live version isn't all that good. I was expecting more for this CD. Next year, I hope they get better equipment and get better performers (no offense to about half that were good)."
2,"A couple of great songs, the rest pure junk!","Let me first start off saying that Ozzy is the best rocker out there. Here are the songs on this CD that I really enjoyed:LINKIN PARK: With You- I LOVE LINKIN PARK AND THIS IS A GREAT LIVE SONG!BLACK SABBATH: The Wizard- The best Sabbath song and a must listen!DROWNING POOL: Bodies- Not a real big fan of the live version but this is a great song. R.I.P. Dave Williams 1972-2002, the singer of Drowning Pool.DISTURBED: Fear- I love Disturbed, they are a great group, this is a great song. Wish they wouldn't curse though.The rest of the songs are pretty bad, except for the 2nd Stage songs, those are pretty cool with the exclusion of Mudvayne which is a Slipknot ... I like Otep and Hatebreed they were pretty cool. I sold the album but burned myself a copy to have. Its okay. You'll either love it or hate it. I will be waiting for Ozzfest 2002: The Live Album (CLEAN VERSION), since I can't go to the shows."
5,Identity 666,"As with the past 5 Identity releases, this is a must buy, and that's whether you're familiar with these bands or not. If you are, then you know exactly why. And if you aren't, then this album is a perfect opportunity to introduce yourself to some amazing and powerful music. Highlights include THE WHOLE ALBUM, but listen to Skin Lab's Second Skin, Jag Panzer's King At A Price, (You should also buy Jag Panzer's Thane To The Throne for some incredible music too.), and Angel Dust, Tiamat, Arch Enemy, Moonspell and more!"
5,Thoroughly Enjoyed,"Great writer! Absolutely glad to have discovered the Bravos. Christine Rimmer is now, one of my favorite Romance writers. Can`t wait for the next book!"
1,Time and money lost :(,"There is such a great lack of MJB dvds, videos and such (especially when you live outside US) that I jumped on that dvd. You will just hear a girl talking and talking... about things each MJB fan know, and you won't have any videos, songs... Nothing, just some bad photos. I eagerly wait for an authorized biography and for MJB songs released on dvd, such live tours! Why that is not available? :("
1,Jason Augustine,"I am also a huge fan of Mary j, but this dvd is RUBBISH!!! no live performances, it just talks about her life, (Which we've already heard about 2 million times) her rags to riches story (which we've heard 2 million times) Thier are no music videos either.Don't waste your money and time on this. please!!The picture quality is also crap! If Geffen records read this review can i ask that they issue us fans with a dvd with live performance's or concert as well as some music videos. DISSAPOINTED!!!!"
1,Just Awful,"The producer of this crap need to be ashamed of themselves. It a travesty somebody has the audacity to capitalize on the negative things that happened to her. The video is fuzzy, all you see is fuzzy still pictures of Mary, the DVD video and sound is awful. The DVD only has interview with fans. Avoid this DVD at all costs! What crap!"
2,Well written but amateurish plot,"I was very disappointed by this book. I think Lawanna Blackwell writes very well but the plot was, in my opinion, predictable and amateurish. The main characters were all very likable, but lacked depth. I kept waiting for something to catch my interest or surprise me but, as I said above, I found the entire plot to be totally predictable. I also found it to be somewhat unrealistic. I know that this story is fiction and that fiction doesn't have to be realistic. However, it should be entertaining but I just found it to be boring.I am a bit surprised by the high marks the other reviewers gave this book. My reading group read it and most of them felt the same way I did."
5,A must read!,"I loved this book! So many characters, and all of them developed! I was left wanting to know all about Sarah's new life at the end. I sure hope it will be continued in the next novel. Sarah is too rich a character to end here!"
4,Lawanna Blackwell does it again!,"Once again, Lawanna Blackwell transports you back to times past. Her characters become real - you can feel their joy, their pain, their struggles, their victories. The Maiden of Mayfair brings us a new family with all of the above. It is a wonderfully written tale of learning how to forgive, and how our selfish actions can affect the lives of others. Ms. Blackwell does an excellent job of teaching her characters about God's love and forgiveness by using their true to life circumstances. All of her books are believable, readable, and hard to put down! This one is no exception."
3,Maiden of Mayfair,Good Christian fare. Lovely story and liked the descriptions of1800 London. Now on to book number 2 in the series.
1,Avoid at all cost,"I got this for my son who was 4 1/2 at the time, set it up and it was worthless. The balls didn't come out straight, there was a problem with the balls falling down the chute to early which then caused me to have shut the thing off and start over again. just avoid this pile of recycled plastic..Not worth the hassle; even at free, I would pass."
3,pitching machine,Rated it a 3 star because it really didn't work as well as I expectedHad to feed the balls occasionally into the machine for it to work
4,OK,Good morning! GOOD product. I am so happy and the product complay my expectations. Thanks a lot!Johnny Villegas Perez
4,Great machine.,"I would call this more a sporting machine than a toy. My purpose was to use this to practice batting (baseball/softball) and for my kids to practice aswell. The balls FIRE (really shoot fast) out of this machine. This is really good to practice your reflexes and alittle to fast for my 6 and 8 year old to bat off. The balls that come with this are softer than the balls you can purchase as extra's and they also shoot the ball distance differently. However,this is a great little machine for what it is, and it runs off batteries. I haven't found anything better than this, but I would not use it as a toy and only supervised with small children. I have already recommended this to a friend for her kids to practice catching off."
4,pitch away,"My 4 yr old grandson, (and his Dad) loved this one. My son had a similar pitchng machine when he was young.This is SO much better. Better than using a stand alone hitting tee. More challenging, more imterested my grandson was with this."
1,Missing Items,"They say you are to get a 27 inch bat and 8 baseballs. but twice now i have not received the balls or the bat! i have called and complained, and was assured they would check the order before sending it out so that they did not forget the bat or balls again, but, you guessed it they forgot the bat and balls. and now they are claiming there is nothing they can do. so you pay for a complete set of items, but you end up with just a pitching machine without a bat to play with it. my 7 year old was crushed. now i have to go out and get him a bat! thanks a lot amazon!Franklin Sports Mlb Pitching Machine No. 6696S3"
2,It's getting returned,"My kids were jumping-up-and-down excited to get this as they love baseball. Unfortunately, there is no way for them to play. Even on a flat surface the balls go in wildly varying directions, heights & distances. The motor is still revving up when the first ball is pitched, so it's always too low/short. The mechanism for loading fails every other time so that two balls are shot out at first (both too low/short). My 4 & 7 yr. olds go from swinging above their heads to getting hit in the hip, to golfing in one round of pitching. They love the concept of the machine, but only get one decent pitch out of the 6 (it already came missing 2 balls - somebody else must have smartly returned it before us). I'm hoping to find a different pitching machine that will make us all happy."
2,Buy lots of batteries,"I bought this for my seven year old for soft toss batting practice. It's to inconsistent to use as batting practice in any fashion. One pitch will be right down the middle, the next will go behind his back and the next will be 10 feet outside. It's good if you want to practice catching line drives or short fly balls. That's it. I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a real pitching machine. Also we went through 8 ""D"" batteries in less than an hour. I hope this helps."
5,Your child will love it,My son is 4 and already hitting them out of the park with this pitching machine. Loads of fun for the whole family. Have it set on a level surface in the back yard. I use a patio 12x12 tile.
2,Better for skeet shooting than batting practice,"Thought this would be great for my 5 year old. He's got decent coordination and can hit balls pitched to him. However, because the product is so light and its mechanism so sensitive, it cannot pitch consistently. Instead, balls fly wildly too high, too short, too far in either direction. Once you think you've lined it up, half the balls are already pitched (it goes fast) and then the slightest jarring throws it out of whack again. My son gets frustrated and bored while we keep futzing with the thing to get it to pitch somewhere near where he is standing. Spend more money and get something more dependable. His 6th birthday is in two weeks and I'm already looking for a replacement."
3,Sports Pitching Machine,"I purchased this for my 5 year old grandson who has started T-Ball. He loved the pitching machine and it was a hit in the neighborhood, but because there were little boys playing with it, they have already broken part of it!"
1,It's for 5yr olds,It pitches okay when it does that is. The overall product quality is below average and the height adjustment doesn't work well. I tried to adjust the ball pitch to go higher and it ended up that the ball stays in the machine. it takes a bit too long between pitches too.I wouldn't recommend this product.
5,"A not too serious, happy-ending type of story","""The Risk is Yours"" is a comedy about two men in prison. One is an actor and the other is a director. Not being your typical prisoners, they are in for some trouble with the other inmates, but cleverly use their wits to ease their situation. Their antics with the other prisoners, guards, and the warden are entertaining and funny.By no means is this a film about tough prison life, but instead one where the events are often absurd. The story behind the story is a romance, as the actor fell in love with a woman before he went to prison and the film is really about their romance. Therefore, it may be considered a good one to watch with your date. If you are looking for a not too serious, happy-ending type of story, then ""The Risk is Yours"" might be the comedy for you."
5,A refreshing new twist on Tetris,"The New Tetris certainly lives up to its name, providing a new play strategy where the key to a high score lies in forming 4x4 blocks out of the normal Tetris pieces, while still completing lines as you did in the original. (See the screenshots for an illustration of one of these 4x4 blocks forming.) To make this task more managable, there is also a 'hold' piece that can be swapped in place of your current piece at will. The game is balanced so that you can play it old-school style just fine (even in multiplayer), but you will acquire lines and advance levels much faster attempting to build the new 4x4 blocks.Mutiplayer is a blast, with up to 4 players and several game options. The music is absolutely awesome. The only serious flaw with the game is the lack of a challenging computer opponent.For casual gamers looking for a fun game to play alone or with friends, this is an excellent choice. For Tetris fans, this is a must-have!"
4,One of the few games worth the money,"The New Tetris is the best one I've seen since the original. The graphics and backgrounds are excellent. The L-Button/swap thing is a great idea as well as block-forming, cause I always used to try to do it. They kept the original blocks and added something called ""Wonders"" which I never understood. The only drawbacks to this game is the shadowing of the piece so you can see where it lands, and when the piece seems to drop in the wrong place. I hardly buy N64 games because of the price, but this is one that I think is worth it."
2,mind of it's own,"To me this game gets very frustrating. This is when the blocks will jump somewhere else when I'm trying to put them in place. At first I thought it might be me that was doing it, but it happens too often, and seems to happen at critical times. Needless to say I don't plan this game too often."
1,VERY SERIOUS NOT A LIE MUST READ DO NOT BUY MATURE CONTENT,"This game was very fun until I found out the game's hidden RATED M secrets. If you unlock the Greek level look closely at the trees. What do you see? A naked man's body. It is not an error in the game. It looks like they planned it. First nudity, now what? DRUGS! The music called HALLUCI stands for HALLUCINATE. If you type the name HALLUCI in as your name and pick the music HALLUCI, it will take you on a virtual drug trip.[also known as kaleidoscope] Do not buy for children."
1,First toy to make my cats flinch,"This is the first and last unreviewed cat toy that I'll buy. I have 2 cats, one is fussy regarding toys the other will usually find amusement in any type of cat toy. When I opened this for him, he was interested and sniffed the mouse. Unfortunately he then batted at it, which causes the toy to bob back and forth - the problem with this is that the metal wire which suspends the toy bounces back and hits him in the face everytime he hits the mouse toy. The wire has the weight and feel of one of those cheap metal coat hangers, not something any cat or human would want landing across the bridge of their nose...The mouse rattles, has an elasticised tail and the body is a hard casing. I'll probably detach the mouse, so they can at least play with it. Oh and the colour of the mouse toy varies, my mouse was orange/yellow - not that relevant to me but worth noting."
5,Zoe loves it!,"According to Zoe, our long hair Grey/Blue 11 year old, this is her most favorite toy ever. We have purchased a couple of these over the years and it remains the best cat toy we have purchased. Zoe is a cat who LOVES her toys and plays with this toy all of the time. My wife swears she hears her during the night playing with it. She loves to crouch down and take a run at it and at times she just lays on her back and swats it with a paw. She highly recommends this purchase!"
1,Magnets for dummies,Very basic look at magnets and not much on therapy. The author makes some interesting links to Ayurvedic medicine but no real insights into how biological systems use magnetic fields despite a chapter on biomagnetism. I wish I had this book when I was in grade seven.
2,"Good information, poorly structured","If you have to read this book for a class, be prepared to untangle poorly written sentences and re-arrange scattered information.The bright side: Turn a relatively boring class into an entertaining forum where you discuss the irony of a poorly written book attempting to teach you how to write and speak well."
4,the blues haters need to find a Donny and Marie cd to review,"If you are looking at these reviews in order to decide if this is a cd worth buying, then the answer is a resounding YES. John Lee Hooker wasn't a guitar virtuoso, but he was a virtuoso bluesman and this cd has some of his best work. If you love the blues, then you need to own this cd (and if you don't love the blues, why are you wasting everyone's time reviewing a blues cd)"
1,Attitude is no replacement for Talent,"I agree with the music fan from Philadelphia who correctly defines Hooker as a non-talent. Those who can play more than one chord do so, those who can't call themselves ""blues artists"" who have ""feeling"" and sell records to people who are just as untalented. Blues do not have to be mindless or repetitive to the point of brainlessness. Blues can be appreciated for the music form it is----simple, rhythmic, and devoid of any sophisticated technical acumen. If that's what you like, fine. But if you appreciate music that contains both ""attitude"" and musicality, keep away from the bin that reads ""John Lee Hooker."" You might want to try the ""Best of Alvin and the Chipmunks""---they have more talent than Mr. Hooker and his ""attitude,"" and a musical IQ that is at least forty points higher."
4,"Definately Recommended, but buy the entire album instead.","Ok, don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Vast & I think Jon Crosby is a genius...but, other than the remix of ""Here"" (which is Fantastic, by the way), I don't really see why you should buy this over the full album. It lacks the fiery intensity of ""Temptation"", the gentle & romantic ""You"" and ""Flames"", and the powerfully spiritual ""I'm Dying"". In the end, though, still recommended."
4,Good radios for a Great price!,So maybe they only have 1.5 range instead of a 2 as it claims. But for the price they are great. I use them all the time. If you are looking for a low-price family radio get these. At 75% off who can resist!
5,Midland 75-407,"Found it very usefull and easy to use. Very clear sound. Had no problem in communicating with others. Found it even more usefull during road trips with my friends when traveling in differnet cars, and when I went fishing and camping. I liked the scan feature."
1,"Great for a week, aweful for a lifetime","The Midland 75-507 14-Channel FRS with Hands-Free Radio VOX Radio looks really good at first glance and it works really well around the house when you test it out, but when you bring it in the woods or on the ski slopes, that one-mile range turns into a two foot range. We used them for a while on car rides until they stopped working. Then we took them to the slopes, but half-way up the chairlift we wouldn't be able to communicate. Then others around us would be on the same chanell and you would hear everything they said. Now, 1 year after buying them, when you turn them on, all you get it static, the VOX doesn't work, and sometimes, when you turn it on it just blinks at the same chanell and you can't talk to anyone. If you want to get one, I reccommend the Motorola TalkAbouts. I've had them for a while and they are MUCH better."
5,The best radio for this price,"These little radios work GREAT! I've used them A lot and they've worked better than I expected. The 14 channels are perfect for most users. If one's being used up, there's always at least one free. The range is pretty good too. I had one in a school bus talking to my friend, and I was in a 15 passenger van. We were able to talk clearly for nearly one mile, and about 1/4 of a mile later we started to break up. Not too bad on Los Angeles freeways if you ask me."
5,Great Radios!,"I just arrived from Las Vegas, and we found these radios a useful tool. From maintaing conversations between the three cars while on the road, to conversation on the mall. Great tool for it you like to travel in a car caravan during family trips. I previously used these same radios, last summer, and loved them. ... I just had to get another pair. You won't regret it. I also loved the search feature, the Priority scan, and other. Oh, yeah, the size is great, fits perfectly in your shirt pocket, or on your waist belt. You can buy the motorola radios, but why? And Battery life on the Midland radios, y great. We had the radios on for over 3 days, and had no problem, they were on for the whole weekend trip."
5,a must have,"i bought these about 3 weeks ago-for a relatives birthday present and decided to try them out first,well i am now keeping them!they work really well,and for the price it is a great deal. we have used these at parks,supermarkets,at home and the mall to keep track of family members.-2 thumbs up.(only problem is i have to buy another present lol)."
4,Just got a pair delivered from Amazon,"Tested just at a mile with 1 radio in a car --- but the instruction manual warns you that if you are in a vehicle the range will be reduced. I would definately recommend these radios. Voice activation delay is annonying, but would not keep me from buying them as in most cases you will not use voice activation anyway."
3,Midland 75-507 FRS radio,"This is a good deal for the price. This radio is a good beginners radio for the Family Radio Service. It is also good for teaching young children the proper use and care of a communication radio without risking much expense. It's sound quality is not the best but quite useable. It has the full legal power limit of 500mw with no licence requirement. It does lack privite line code capability which could be a nuisance in congested areas. It uses 3 AA cells which can be bought at low cost at Price-Costco, 40 alkaline cells for under 10 dollars if you buy the Kirkland brand. They are good cells (batteries) and hold up well."
2,why not offer all the parts?,"I ordered 2 of your FRS radios and the ear bud remote microphones. I did get all I ordered BUT your advertising to me, is misleading . I cannot use the remote earbud microphones. Why? Because they require an adapter Midland part number 22-001 Why wasen't this mentioned in your original write up? I tried to identify the part number from midland and it is not listed. So the ear bud microphones are usless. I expected that they should be Plug and Play as the advertisement implied. Where can I find such and animal?"
3,Just bought for Christmas presents to Others,"I was impressed with ratings it is getting from Amazon so I bought it. The packaging and documentations is not as impressive as the other competitor FRS radio. I did not see any warranty card. Really the quality of the documentations/packaging need a lot of improvements in presentation/paper usage. I am having some hardtime removing the battery cover to put in and remove the batteries. But so far, testing looks ok and off to gift-wrapping and hopefully recipient will be happy and product can endure the wear and tear usages."
5,Great price for great range,These handheld radios are excellent. They have a great range and you can't beat the price. You can't go wrong with these radios!
2,Not exactly the best....,"Thinking this was similar to the Motorola walkie talkies I purchased two of them, but was disappointed and am returning them. No way the range is 1-2 miles on these - I started with static at 1/3 mile in shopping areas and 1 mile in an open residential area. Good for kids use or under one mile in open woods...."
1,Not what it claims!,"I didn't like these radios...i have returned them. Problems encountered 1) when you bump the unit (even slightly), the batteries jump out of place and you have to open up the battery compartment and re-seat them. 2) Noisy - too much static and cuts off 3) no way is this a 2 mile range. we had trouble using them in a department store when we were one department apart. They're range is very limited - maybe a couple blocks outside.These radios are reminiscent of the old walkie talkie I got as a kid for Christmas, although they are better than that. This may be a good kid's toy, but the battery jumping out of place will be a problem with kids.If you're interested in a radio for your family to stay in touch at the mall, outings, etc. spend a more money and get something better...that's what I plan on doing."
1,BORING!,Being a Disney fan I thought this game would be cute. I was wrong. If I wanted to jump around a game board with no reward I would play an actual board game. You are lucky to win one mini game every 15 turns. You also have to be linked to another gameboy to even get the mini games. This game needs to advertise that you need 2 gameboys and 2 players or more to have the least bit of fun. Otherwise you are pointlessly jumping around a game board. I can't believe its a $30 game. I have way more fun with my $10 Ninja Turtle game.
3,"""Customer Images"" are fake","Someone is toying with a little false advertising here.The two ""Customer Images"" posted above by ""Andrew Harrington"" are fake. Those are photos of ""Carla of La Zona Models"". Google it. The original photos are of her holding something completely different.I suspect the same thing of the image uploaded by ""The Maestro""; it looks like the book was Photoshop'd in.Beyond that, the book has a novice feel, with poor layout, cheap production, and outdated information (e.g. clubs it mentions no longer exist).Given that there are fake images planted in the ""Customer Images"", I suspect some of these 5-star reviews may be fake as well.UPDATE 5/22: The fake images were removed sometime after I wrote this review; most likely removed by Amazon."
5,AWESOME!,"Wow, I am so happy with this book. I used to waste all my time on trips: walking, admiring architecture, meeting people, learning about the culture. You know, stupid stuff. Once I got this book, though, oh man! Now I know exactly where to go to do what any guy in a foreign country REALLY wants to do! Exploiting women, participating in their objectification, and just overeall demeaning them is so much easier than I thought! Every fantasy I had of participating in the vilest part of human nature is now so easy to do FOR REAL. If you have zero respect for yourself and even less for women, this is the book for you!"
3,Great when 1st purchased.. Down Hill ever Since,"Purchased my Denon From ovation.. 1st ones off the truck about 1 1/2 years ago.. THe display went out 2 months later... Sent it in..Shipped it off.. Was gone for 7+ months. Display was fixed however now the TosLink Audio and 5.1 surround is missing high freqs..THe tech support is VERY hard to get a hold off. If not existant.DO NOT BUY A DENON IF YOU WANT SUPPORT.. honestly I will never buy a another ""denon"" product To much hassle.. Now the warranty is run out and I'm stuck with a broke audio player.. However The picture/playing/control is second to non. If I did not have any problems I would buy another one. But not now.. It's feature rich without a doubt just wish it did not have so many problems.."
5,Much better than entry level.,"We recently installed a home theater and thought we'd save a little money my keeping our cheap DVD player that worked fine with a 27"" TV. This cheap DVD player produced numerous annoying video artifacts. Tried the Denon 2910 and the difference was amazing! At least to this price point you really get what you pay for!"
3,Denon has no tech support,"My Denon DVD-2910 quit playing 5.1 audio. Denon has no tech support available that works. The phone system does not allow a person to hold for a tech support person for more that a few minutes. The system asks you to speak louder and asks how you want to send the message. What message, I was never asked if I wanted to send a message. Over all Denon's tech support is unusable. Plan to spent long hours reviewing the manual and hopefully you can figure out things on your own. My question was not in the manual. My question is why did I go from 5.1 output to 2 channel output when I changed nothing? And how do I change it back to 5.1? When working correctly the Denon DVD-2910 is a 5-star dvd player but when things go wrong the tech support is a 0-star and the 2910 becomes a very frustrating block of plastic and wires."
4,A classic on model car building,"Although a little dated when compared to our latest car kits with photo-etchedparts and minute resin details, this covers the basics of building, painting, anddetailing car and rod kits. If you like to work with the older AMT style kits, thisis right for you. Modern techniques are used as well, including the substitutionof machined metal parts for the plastic ones, to achieve greater realism, and togenerate more interest in the models.I saw techniques that were new to me.Worth a look, if you enjoy model car building."
4,Good but heavy,"I bought this for a beauty dish I made that mounts to an umbrella holder like this and the first one I had (a different brand/model) broke because it was plastic. I don't think I could break this, as it is solid as a rock. It seems almost too heavy to be aluminum, but it is definitely ""heavy duty"""
2,Reconditioned-not the best way to go,"This was a factory reconditioned unit, it arrived pretty dirty and scratched. The water lines, filters and fittings were the worst part, fairly corroded and full of grit (and perhaps some kind of salts?), although the factory checklist was marked that it was cleaned. After some cleaning of my own the unit works mostly as it should, the internal pressure switch that turns the pump on sometimes sticks and I have to give the machine a good whack to get it to trip on.The performance is satisfactory, about as much as you can get from an electric model, if you want to get serious about cleaning you will have to go gas powered, I just did not want to deal with the noise.Overall I don't expect it to last and suspect that I will be sending it back to the factory, hopefully before the warranty runs out."
4,Great Equipment,"This washer is great and meet all my needs. While I was shopping around, I can across this model but was relunctant to order at first. However, the price was right and upon receipt it was easy to assemble."
1,Why was this published?,"After a great start and several years of successful creativity in Alines comics, Dark Horse began putting out some real stinkers in the mid to late 90's, of which Kidnapped is the absolute worst. The art is fairly poor, and the story mostly unoriginal with the added fault of being less of an Aliens tale and more of a viral outbreak story. The idea of the Aliens themselves being a sort of terrible macro-virus already exists in the Aliens' universe of fiction, and therefore doesn't really need an additional contagious element to it. Also, the flesh-eating-virus in this story is portayed as pink goo, which is not only not-scary but pretty silly. The characters just follow the pink trail around as they try to get it through their thick heads that something may be wrong. There's lots of great material out there adding to the Aliens mythos, but this story should just be ignored lest it detracts from the whole."
1,look else where,"The look of the ring is exactly as it appear here on amazon. The stones and the band are very pretty and my wife loved it. The reason i say to stay away is that even before it came out of the box one of the stones had fallen out. I realize that for the price i am not buying quality which wasn't the point anyhow, but a candy necklace can at least last an afternoon. There are many rings on amazon with in $5 of this that are much better and with the same visual appeal"
3,okay,gems fall off when ever you hit it on something 2 have alredy fallen out and i got it like 3 days ago
4,works great,This is a great screen for the dollar amount. I have been using it for about 2 months. It goes up and down with no problems.
2,"""No one understands...""","The single line spacing makes the contents very hard to read. The contents are of very high level stuff. They may be good for IT managers or architecturers, but are hardly valuable for developers. If you are a developer, be careful that, as the KMWorld Magazine says, ""No one understands ...""."
2,I really wanted to like it but . . . tired and mean humor.,"Being a fan of both Samuel L. and Eugene L., I was looking forward to this film with eager anticipation of some good belly laughs. Unfortunately I only had a few smiles and some half-hearted chuckles. This talented twosome had a tired script to work from. They gallantly try to make it work--Samuel with his tough guy with a heart of gold act and Eugene with his good hearted dork act. It wasn't enough to get past the tired fart jokes and some of the meaner humor. I didn't think it was funny that an ATF agent was ramming an informant with his Cadillac and complaining about the front of his car smelling like ""ass."" Skip it and re-rent American Pie."
1,Put it back!!!!!!!!!,"I often write reviews in rhymeBut this one's hardly worth my timeI'd sum it up in just one verseBut you might say that's much too terseI'd like to talk about the plotBut that's something it hasn't gotI can't believe Sam and EugeneWould stink so much on the big screenIt isn't smart, it isn't funnyIt's only there to take your moneyJust put it back - don't even rentThis one ain't worth a goshdarn centAmanda Richards, November 4, 2006"
2,The Man,"The producers of The Man calculated that the collision of their innate racial qualities would produce the kind of comic sparks that Levy and Queen Latifah set off in Bringing Down the House. When ATF agent Derrick Vann (Jackson, Pulp Fiction) learns that his partner is dead and a cache of guns has been stolen, he sets up a sting to get the weapons back. But into the middle of his scheme stumbles Andy Fiddler (Levy, A Mighty Wind, American Pie), a dental supplies salesman from Wisconsin. From there unspools some formulaic buddy-movie pap: Vann gives Fiddler a dose of excitement and Fiddler teaches Vann a little compassion and trust as they improbably track down the bad guys. To a degree, the producers were right--the interplay between Levy's Groucho eyebrows and Jackson's burning scowl provides the only juice this movie has. The Man doesn't deserve actors as talented as Levy and Jackson, but there's no denying they apply themselves diligently and squeeze out a couple laughs."
2,blah,it sucked i don't think u should get it the acting is bad ive seen jackson so much better don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,THIS IS MUCH FUNNIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK!,I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this buddy movie in the vein of 48 hrs. I like both stars which makes it easier to watch. I thought it was pretty funny and Levy is a crack up! It was worth the price I found it for in a bargain bin for under $2.00. I give it 3 1/2 stars for surprising me.
4,very funny,"I never even wanted to see this movie b/c of all the bad reviews I read on it. I just figured it would be stupid. So after I had several people tell me how funny it was I decided to rent it myself. I really enjoyed it! It is not the best movie I have ever seen by far, but it is funny and very entertaining. I have come to find that the movies that have the worst reviews are the ones I end up liking the most. Give this movie a try, you will enjoy it!"
3,IT'S OKAY!!!!!,"Why did this movie get such savagely bad reviews? I rented it with the full expectation that I would hate it, that it would be a non-stop barrage of stupid jokes. Not true. The plot is decent and there are funny lines thrown in appropriately without going overboard. Levy and Jackson work well together. Sure, it is a formula ""buddy picture"" from start to finish, but it was good, not bad."
4,ODD But It Works,If Someone would have told me about Eugene Levy and Samuel L Jackson was doing a movie together. I would laugh them off the face of the earth. Despite what the critics say judge this movie for yourself. Personally I like the movie and would recommended it to anyone. Even though it's odd it works.
1,When fart jokes are the best you can do...,"In ""The Man"", we have a dental supply salesperson (played by Eugene Levy) that gets caught up in a weapon's deal, and has to work with a cranky ATF agent (played by Samuel L. Jackson).The plot itself was not too bad. Unfortunately, the movie is supposed to be a comedy. And when you are a comedy, and the best gag you have in the whole movie is a fart joke, you can pretty much guess that the movie ""stunk up the joint"". (All puns intended.)Levy was his usual bland self, and Jackson simply played a bully. Neither was outstanding, leaving the movie to feel awfully flat.I wouldn't watch this again if I had a choice. Watching it the first time was of only limited laughs, and not really worth the 83 minutes I spent watching it."
4,Hilarious!,"Great movie, I love SLJ, he's an American treasure, and he was so funny, as was Eugene Levy. Worth your time."
2,Lacking,"The book gives a generally correct picture of Huntington's disease and how it affects all members of a family. However, as another reviewer has pointed out, some of the information is dated. It also covers the secrecy that many families practice, which may partially explain why some people say they had no idea the disease was in their family. Otherwise, the book doesn't have much to offer. The writing is stilted and definitely needs an editor. The story line is trite and at times unbelievable. The protagonist is a whiner who does not generate much sympathy. He seems to be caught in adolescence, still trying to find his identity. Works of fiction with a particular disease as the focal point must be very hard to write. Perhaps writers should stop trying."
2,Trying to hard to be clever,"The first thing I noticed about this book was it had several racy or off color jokes, & the use of the ""F"" word once. That didn't particularly bother me, but was surprising in a Santa book, & I was glad I read it before purchasing for some other people I'd intended to.There is no magic in this book. It is an attempt to be clever, & some of it undoubtedly is. Some made me smile. But I didn't feel any Christmas spirit or excitement after reading it, just that I was supposed to be impressed with how smart the author was. It also had a section about how obviously Christmas isn't about God or celebrating Christ's birth. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to Christmas fans. Someone who enjoys the intellectual arguements in here would enjoy it."
2,Dundee Township Moments Frozen in Time,I liked the book format the spiral binding and all the pictures. I wish the author had done more research on the people of the town. He covered a lot of what is known as West Dundee but not much on East Dundee. Maybe a follow up book with more stories and less pictures.
1,Really smelly piece of plastic,"This web works OK as a hand exerciser (though I barely used it) - my problem was with the smell. It was STRONG! It made my whole room stink of rubber/plastic. I washed it in soap and water many times - no improvement. When I used it, my hands would stink. I grew to hate the smell. I finally set it outside in the sun in hopes it would eventually outgas and stop stinking. No luck - it stunk even after the UV degraded the rubber material and it all fell apart. So I threw it away.At Physical Therapy, I used a different brand of web exerciser, and it did not stink. So maybe some other brand doesn't have the same problem. The concept is good, the material choice of this brand was horrible."
4,The new edition is an improvement for sure,"I am glad I purchased the updated edition. It has a lot more information and better pictures than the second edition. The case studies they present are a considerably helpful edition as they present the patients symptoms of different pathologies they are profiling, along with the structural and soft tissue components of various pathologies they are describing."
2,Joint and Structure - too complicated,This book is required for my class and is terribly wordy and complicated! I think that more pictorial instruction would be greatly beneficial. A supplemental DVD to show examples of clinical scenarios would also be helpful for visual learners.
1,Not very useful,"This book is difficult to read and understand. I am a DPT student and it is required for my classes, but I did not find it helpful at all."
1,"Poor Quality, Overpriced",I received my lapdesk with a broken light that I had to repair with a soldering iron. The overall quality seems quite poor - it's basically a sheet of (poorly milled) PVC laid on top of a cushion. I regret having purchased this item. Save your money and find a better product to do the job.
4,"high quality lap desk, but light needs improvement","This lap desk is of very high quality (minus the light feature). Strong desk area, soft lap area. Large work space. I am very pleased with my purchase. However, the light is basically useless. It takes 4 C-cell batteries and they are used up very quickly. The light has a plastic cover over it with a reflector background. I suppose the design is supposed to reflect the most light possible. However, the design creates ""patterns"" of light on your work surface. It is not even and quite annoying. I did not buy this product for the light feature, so I'm pleased. If you are looking to buy a lap desk with a light, try another product."
5,Good product!,"This is light weight, works well as a lap desk or under my laptop. I use this daily and really like it."
4,Great,When I bought this I had planmed on returning it..But when I got it.. I decided to gve it a shot and man Am I glad I did It works better them my old one...The only bad thing I can say is NO CUP HOLDER as I'm in a wheelchair it would have made things easier (that's why I was going to return it) But it balnces well on my lap (as long as I'm tilted back a bit)As far as the the light...I didn't even bother with it I just leave it aloneAll and all great laptray worth the money!
3,Replacement Bulb Please,I really like this product but the bulb went out too soon. I would recommend it if this company would enclose an order form in the box with the product for reordering such things as replacement bulbs. Can someone tell me where to get a replacement bulb for this?
3,Its a decent buy if you are a couch person,I bought this mainly because I spend much of my time on the couch when I'm at home.Pros:Its very comfortable on your lap compared to the burning laptop.It allows you to keep two book next to each other at the same time. Helpful especially while completing journals.Cons:Light requires 4 C type batteries that don't last too long.Plastic on top can get burnt if the laptop gets overheated. This happened to me.
3,Lapdesk by Tranquility Zone,"While making it somewhat easier to keep books at a height to ease neck pain, the unit has some deficiencies. The light runs down the four ""C"" in a very short period on time. Also the surface of the desk is very slippery. That coupled with a very small lip to keep the book from sliding off the bottom, makes it difficult to keep the book in a high enough position to read."
3,Nice Product,"Overall I am pleased with the product. The desk gets heavy when you put the batteries in. I had a hard time getting the batteries in, so start out with good ones that will last awhile. Desk is sturdy. Held my 15.4"" widescreen laptop with no problem and there was room to use my wireless mouse. I am able to sit cross legged and the desk is still stable.Edited on 1/13/11: Yeah, with the batteries in, this desk is way to heavy and has no room to move around on your lap really. Skip it."
3,Laptop Desk,"When I received this product, the light/lamp was busted so I emailed Amazon.com and ""customer service"" replied that you were sending a replacement and also .... in the email said .. ""FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS, WE DON'T WANT THE ORIGINAL BACK, SO PLEASE DISPOSE OF IT AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.""Then I received another email form ""orders@amazon.com"" reminding me to return the damaged item or I would be charged AGAIN for that item. I tried to reply but I never heard from anyone. At this point, I don't know what I'm suppose to do ... return it or dispose of it.I love the lapdesk except the lamp/light for this desk is useless! It doesn't give hardly any light and a replacement bulb is impossible to find."
1,Light did not work,"My daughter received this item, and was very happy with it until we tried to turn on the light. The light did not work. Since the item was a gift we did not have the receipt. After replacing the light bulb (which was broken) the light still did not work. After taking the desk apart, and playing with the electronics (wrench, exacto knife, ohm-meter) I determined that one lead was soldered to the wooden board (about 1/4th of an inch from the switch contact).I concluded that the desk could not have ever worked (since wood does not conduct electricity). So only buy this product if you want a desk from a company that doesn't check to see if the product works."
2,Weak light,"You'd expect a brighter light given that it needs 4 C cell batteries. I hate how its a single tiny bulb and the way that the light is dispersed is very uneven. The padding is too stiff to be comfortable. Since I already bought it, I will continue to use it, but if I had a choice I'd keep shopping around."
3,ok,"A little uncomfortable, not enough space for a wireless mouse, putting batteries in makes it heavy but it basically does it job."
2,Found it comfortable but the light leaves something to be desired. . .,"Requires for C batteries. I expected LED but got a quirky little bulb that generates a surprising amount of heat but very little usable light. Otherwise, I found it a usable tool."
3,mixed bag,"Good:Flat surface (I really can't find other products that have a truly flat surface like this).Bad:Light. I wish I can get a model without the lightI lived in fear of accidentally pushing the light and scratching my laptop screen (the light is made of metal).My old compter got really hot (1st gen intel MacBook Pro, they ran very hot). So hot that it damaged the surface of this thing and peeled the top cover where the computer leg rested on it.Someone spilled something on the padding it so I had to get rid of it (It was uncleanable).And now I find myself not willing to buy another one. If they had a model without the light I'd get it."
3,"Comfortable, sturdy, hard to keep clean.","The desk is a good design come to life. The base is very comfortable and adequately cushioned for long use. The battery compartment is a little difficult to get to, but for the price, this is a pretty good pick. I'm glad I picked this over the others on the market. Recommend it for reading but not for food or drink as it isn't the most stable for those reasons. The base is made of very good quality terry-like cloth, but it may be hard to keep clean."
5,Very comfortable to use exceeded my expectations for the price!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It is quite comfortable to use, and a great value for the price!"
4,A Special Gift,"I gave this laptop as a gift and, although I know she was very excited about it, especially since it has a light, I do not know how well it is working for her. She lives in another city and state.I received it in a timely manner and was very pleased myself, at how it looked."
5,It's a Fairly OddDouble Feature,These DVD's feature episodes from Channel Chasers and Superhero Spectacle. Here's the episodes:1.Channel Chasers2.Spaced Out3.Microphony4.This is Your Wish5.Chin Up6.Boy Toy7.The Crimson Chin Meets Mighty Mom and Dyno Dad8.Crime Wave9.Mighty Mom and Dyno Dad10.Action Packed11.Tottaly Spaced Out12.So Tottaly Spaced Out13.Miss Dimmsdale14.Mind Over MagicGood DVDs for the whole family.
3,"A capturing, and surprisingly lovely little book of poems.","I really loved this little collection of poems, some of the poems in this book captured the sheer essence of life itself and others captured an amazing sense of the weird that lies in each of our lives. It's not so much that some of the poems in this book are good in a whole, it's just that there are certain lines in the poems; like the back says "" You may find some interesting lines that you will never forget."" AutoMaton Perfume makes you want to read and keep reading from the first poem right up until the very last. Every single poem is unique, and some take you to different worlds where ""sun melted radios"" actually work.My personal favorite is ""Abundance"" because in a nutshell we all want marshmallows that aren't burnt. Some poems will make you chuckle to yourself and others, might leave you embarrassed even if you're all alone, but in the end you may come out a little younger, and all the different."
3,Not bad but pricey for what it is.,"At the time of this review this lamp is 17.99. This lamp has a very short adjustable neck that is 6inches. The opening for the bulb is about 4.5 inches. The cord is 6ft long, but is coiled so you can't get the full use of the 6ft. The clip is strong on and holds tight onto the thin surface I have it on. It does get very hot even with a small 40watt bulb and the neck, in my opinion is too short. Taking that into considering it does put out enough light for the tasks I do and is very portable. I would like to see a longer neck and longer cord for this price. A ""fair price"" for this quality would be 11.99."
3,Switch wore out after a few months.,"This is the second lamp of this make I have owned. Eventually, the switch on the first one got to the point where I could not use it, so I had to throw the lamp away. The next lamp I have had more than a year, and its switch is also resisting -- very much. I have to use quite a bit of force to twist it. But it fills the bill of placing light just where I want it."
1,Where is it???,I ordered this on the 16th of February. I have received all my items I ordered before AND after I ordered this product.
1,Not helpful!,"I did not find the Bobby helpful. It was awkward for feeding, for I had to lean forward for my baby to feed. The pillow is not stuffed enough for small breasted mothers."
5,Does the trick,"My preemie boys are enjoying their boppies, it is helping to keep their heads elevated to reduce reflux. Babies are getting bigger and they fit better. They are close to 8 pounds, at 5 pounds the boppies are a bit too big for the babies. We also use the boppies for tummy time."
2,Disappointing.,"This product sounds like a great idea. Granted, there are other purposes I wound up using my Boppy for but breast feeding wasn't really one of them. I found the Boppy to be far too small for me to comfortably feed my little one. I kept putting pillows under it. The great use I DID get out of it was when my little one was very new, I would place the Boppy in the bassinet to prop him up. Worked beautifully but still not what I thought the Boppy was for. I much preferred ""My Breast Friend"" and ""Luna Lullaby Bosom Nursing Pillow""."
5,Love It,"I absolutely love this pillow!! It is super adorable I have a few months to go, but I cant wait to get to use it!!"
2,faded disappointment,"I purchased this slip cover after my original boppy (with a different slip cover) was left behind on a trip. The brown color faded on the first wash! The slip cover, though cute, looks like I have had it for years, not one month. Dissappointed, but 10 bucks is not worth the effort of waiting in the mail line to return, so I am just living with it."
1,DISAPPOINTED BOPPY BUYER,"I ordered a Boppy with a kite cover which looked really cute in the picture on Amazon. Unfortunately, the fabric was not described. It was not the plush, soft fabric I have seen on other Boppy products. The cover was colorful, but harsh to the touch--not baby friendly at all. I returned the item for a refund. I urge Amazon to identify the fabric on products like this so the buyer knows exactly what is being offered."
1,"For breastfeeding, it's better than a pillow... but not much better","Saying this is better than a pillow is like saying a rock is better at hammering nails than your fist. Shouldn't you just get a hammer? There are others (Breast Friend pillow, etc) that are actually made just for breastfeeding, and are much more useful."
1,Tainted product that I could do without!,"I was told that as a first time mom planning to nurse her child that the Boppy Nursing Pillow was something that I could not do without. I was overjoyed at my baby shower when I received the pillow as a gift. When I opened it up, I was super bummed out when the room instantly filled with a nasty chemical smell from the flame retardant. Unless you plan to chain smoke while simultaneously breast feeding your child, these chemicals seem somewhat overkill. It does not say anywhere in the description of the item that flame retardant is present, but it most definitely taints this otherwise handy product. Two very enthusiastic thumbs down!"
3,what takes so long to get a boppy?,What is taking so long for this item? This part of the whole baby gift is the most essential. You are criminal for taking so long to ship this.
1,Useless,"I bought 2 of these while we were expecting twins.The twins are now at 2 weeks and we had almost never used the pillows.I hoped that these would help us while feeding the babies.Actually we just place the babies on our lap and feed them.I think if you have a small body or have difficulty in holding babies, this pillow might help. But you can also use a regular pilow and save your money. In my opinion this product is just a marketing gimmick."
5,Boppy rocks,What can I say that hasn't been said before: Boppy is irreplaceable for you and your new baby! The owl cover is so cute. My baby kept trying to touch them.
3,totally overrated,"this is one of those things that everyone says you need that I found not useful. It's by no means bad, but certainly by no means great. It is way too low for me to use for nursing, I either had to hunch over or put another pillow beneath it. My husband never used it for bottle feeding, he propped his arm up on a regular pillow. Sure, I propped my baby up on it for a while. Now that my baby is crawling we use it around the crib leg on the floor so she doesn't bump her head. Actually get the most use out of it for that. I got the waterproof liner, but can't tell you if it is good or bad because it never got wet. Very over-rated."
5,Best Invention Ever!,"If I could have given this 10 stars I would have. This is possibly the most versatile baby product you will ever own. I used mine from the moment my baby was first child was born, and knew it was an item I had to keep.Here's what I used it for, and I probably didn't even think of everything:donut for recovering from child birth (it took me 3 weeks to be able to sit comfortably)nursing pillowneck pillow for dad when he was bottle feedingsupport for tummy timesupport for baby when she's learning to sit upsnuggle pillow for big brother when baby is laying on her backI purchased 2 different covers, including the velour which is like butter. Buy this, you won't be sorry!!"
5,The Perfect Nursing Pillow,"To add my two cents to what other reviewers have said, this pillow makes it so much easier to get your baby in position to nurse. It really is a must-have for breastfeeding mothers. I like this slipcover too -- very cute and easy to care for. Get two slipcovers through, so you can still use the Boppy when one cover is in the wash (and believe me, those can get pretty messy fairly quickly)."
4,Boppy pillow are great,I love boppy pillows and they make feeding time so much easier. This one is very nice and is stuffed enough making it firm yet soft and flexible so you get all of the support that you need. The only reason I gave this particular one 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is much much much pinker in person then in the picture. I thought it would be more of a softer pedal kind of pink rather than more of a hot pink which it is in person. I wanted something girly so it will do. I just wish the color was a little softer.
4,"Boppy pillows are great, but there are better covers than this one","This is my second Boppy. I've been using the first for almost 3 years, and it's still in great condition. It's been machine washed and dried several times using the delicate cycle. I love my Boppy pillows!I have two other Boppy covers that are soft cotton jersey, and I really love them. The cover on this pillow is 100% polyester. It's a little scratchy, so I use it as my back-up cover. The cotton jersey covers are slightly more expensive, but they are much nicer."
5,Excellent product is BoppY!,"I bought ""Boppy"" for my great-granddaughter's baby shower - her big brother has one and it is his FAVORITE pillow - even at 19 months! Thank you Amazon for having such a fabulous product that truly works as an assistant to the mom while she feeds the baby and the baby after nursing is over!SincerelyBarbara Kinney"
3,Not that good for our newborn son,"My wife just delivered our first kid. With her tummy still relatively large and will remain so for the next few weeks, our son rests on the inside edge of the Boppy pillow. Because of the curved shape, he keeps slipping down in between my wife and the pillow while nursing. This can be rather painful when he falls out of position, which is very often.Our pediatrician recommended MyBrestFriend pillow to us. We've used that for a few days now, and that one is much better for us because of the square edge vs the round edge on Boppy."
5,Extremely comfortable and easy to use,"Dads can use this when bottle feeding your baby as well. After your baby is done using this, you can probably use this as a neck rest in your recliner - so it MAY not be entirely useless after your baby is more than a year old."
1,useless don't waste your money,"This is completely useless for breastfeeding, or anything else. The opening is really small so it didn't fit around my waist. (Maybe if i was a size 0 right after giving birth it would have!) Also the curves along the length of the pillow put a baby at the wrong angle for nursing. I have nursed 2 babies through one year and have never used it once! I tried the first day at the hospital until a nurse suggested I use something else. If you are pregnant, don't waste your money! I use a pillow and blanket, or try a product called my breast friend."
5,great boppy,"I've never found any pillow that compares to the boppy; a must have for breastfeeding moms! I loved this one. Very fluffy, form-fitting around the waist. Easily removable cover for washing and came in a nice carrying case!"
3,used to be better,"I no longer have my first boppy (purchased 12+ years ago) so when my newest baby was born, I made sure to get another one. But I don't like the new iteration as well as the old. The pillow is now softer and doesn't provide such good support. It doesn't fit as well around me, either, though perhaps that's because my own shape has changed. It's nice to be able to change slipcovers, but if I recall correctly, you could buy aftermarket slipcovers for the original boppy (and I just used a burp cloth draped over the top). I find that regular pillows are about as helpful as this boppy (i.e., somewhat helpful but not extremely helpful), and my back really misses the old one."
5,Fast Deliver - Great Quality,"I am from Brazil and ordered this item because a friend said it was the best of the kind.The price of this item in Brazil would be the same of importing it from Amazon, with the plus that in Amazon I have more options of paterns.The monkey dance cover I found only here and wanted it so much.It came very very fast and I am 100% satisfied with the product, which has great quality and will be very useful for me and my baby! Thanks Amazon!"
1,Boppy is Sloppy,"Over-Hyped unnecessary additions to the junk piled up in your home. Tried it for a week and had to return because, of serious quality issues. $15 will get you something which is far better than this Sloppy-Boppy at Walgreens."
2,Crosslegged support,"In order for boppy pillow to suppot uYour hand and baby correctly you need to always be sitting cross legged. It fit my waist properly but is higher in center and flat on the sides due to which it did not support my hands well.Also for feeding 8-10 times a day and for 1-1.5 hrs per feed, sitting cross legged is extremly painful. Will not recommend for chair/ sitting on bed feeds.I ended up having pain in legs and hand muscles using the boppy"
4,Nice to my c-section incision,"This was a life saver after I had my baby. I had an emergency c-section and this pillow was so soft and comfortable around my incision site. I didn't know if I would like this or the breast friend, so I bought both. The breast friend uses a hard, firm type of foam and it was very uncomfortable for me. I did get good use out of both but in the end, the boppy wins because it is more versatile. If they made a boppy with pockets and a belt like the breast friend it would be the ultimate breastfeeding pillow!!"
5,Love it!,"I love the boppy! My son likes sleeping cradled in it, in fact he will rarely get to sleep anywhere else. We had to wedge it into his basinet to get him to sleep at night! It is also great support for my arms while nursing."
3,Just buy a regular pillow,"Dumb things have dumb names and this is no exception. A pillow works just fine. If you need a breastfeeding pillow, get a breastfriend pillow that actually wraps around you. But if you just want a pillow for baby to hang out on or give yourself a little extra support, get a regular pillow. This is marketed as one of those things you need, but no, you need a break, not a boppy."
2,Never stays in place,I wonder how it gets so many reviews..This just doesn't stay in place while nursing..You have to keep adjusting..I wish I had not wasted money on this..A normal pillow is much better.
4,Very Good Coffee Grinder,"Very good coffee grinder for the price. Performs as specified. As other reviewers have noted, depending upon taste, must add more coffee beans than stipulaed in instructions. Not much of a problem. Must calibrate to one's own requirements."
2,Overrated,"The grinding part of this grinder does well, but everything else is mediocre at best. The ""chamber maid"" isn't tight enough against the bottom to really get all the grounds out, the bowl and lid are a bit difficult to put in and lock into place, and after 6 months of use, I have difficulty getting the buttons to line up just so to activate the grinder. My old crappy ToastMaster grinder was more faithful than this one. I will be buying a replacement soon."
1,Fair grind but quickly kaput!,"Had this grinder about a year. It often left big chunks of beans in the grind. Now, it has died. My old Kitchen Aid A9 worked for over 15 years. I am going to see if I can find it on auction."
1,Mr Coffee has cheapened the construction!,"We had one of these for many years and it provided great service but eventually wore out, so we bought another one. It has a much cheaper fit and finish than the old one. The bowl has a looser much less positive fit. The lid used to snap fit closed, now it does not, so when emptying the bowl it makes a mess of grounds on our kitchen counter. Worse of all, they shortened the electric cord by so much that it no longer reaches a standard height kitchen outlet, this means the grinder must be held up in the air with two hands near the outlet when ginding. We are now shopping for a different grinder and this one will end up in the garbage."
3,OK but have to press and hold til done.,"Used it almost daily for about two weeks. Grinds well. However, last one I had, the lid and chamber were very simple. This one is a bit not user friendly because you have to hold the chamber and lid consecutively while turning opposite while also supporting the base. Also, you have to press and ""hold"" down the on button til it's done grinding. I don't really like this. My other one, you simply set your grind and press the button. While it's grinding I could ready my coffee cup, condiments, etc. It get's the job done, but it's not as enjoyable as my other one. I'm going to return it and search for another one."
2,fine for espresso and drip,"Really wanted a bean grinder that could grind for all types of coffee. The package said this one could, so I bought it. I didn't know much about coffee or coffee tools, so I had an excuse. This type of blade grinder is great for espresso (very fine) and drip (medium to fine), but when I try to do a course grind, it is impossible to grind all the beans without over grinding some. So when I use my coffee press I invariably end up with coffee bean in my mug.If you want to use a French press, I would suggest a burr grinder which allows the beans to fall through the blades and into a separate container."
1,Don't waste your Money,"I received this grinder in the mail about a week ago. It has already quit working.I realize it is cheap, but I expected it to last more than a week. My last cheap grinder lasted a couple years. It wasn't a Mr. Coffee. I will probably go back to that brand (should have in the first place).Don't waste your money on this grinder!"
2,"Gets the job done, there are better choices probably","I really don't care for this grinder at all. It does get the job done, but transferring from the grinder to the coffee maker is a messy business. The 'chamber maid cleaning system' is pretty ineffective. Some manual cleaning is still required, and the cleaning system actually hinders getting the last bit of grind/debris out of the chamber. It's awkward to use because the electric cord is so short it's a bare couple of inches from the wall."
4,Good Baby food processor..Oops its a coffee grinder,Yeah. I brought it to grind coffee. But apparently ended up using it as a baby food processor. It does good work as coffee grinder ..but much better work as baby food processor. Its perfect for single portion baby food and my baby gets to eat freshly prepared food everyday. Happy baby .. happy Mommy
4,Mr Coffee IDS77 coffee grinder with hambermaid cleaning system,"Sturdy, well-made, recommended by Cook's Illustrated and effective. Requires rinsing after use. Automatically determined grinding time depending on grind selected and amount of coffee used convenient. Grind particle size mostly consistent. Instructions helpful."
3,"Extra cord in base, less messy grinder","This grinder has extra electrical cord in the base if you pop the bottom off. It is less messy than the kind you flip over, but mine quit working within a year."
5,Love it,"Bought this after I got so tired of only being able to grind a little coffee at a time with my old grinder. I don't do anything fancy as far as coffee goes, just grind it fresh every day for use in a standard drip coffee maker. So I love this. Can grind enough for a whole pot or as little as 4 cups. Love the ease of use and the fact that the cup can go in the dishwasher. Great for the price!"
4,Mr. Coffee IDS75 Electric Coffee Grinder,"Grinder design is attractive (looks good on kitchen counter). Grinding is OK but not completely uniform according to medium setting, which is the only one we have used. Cleaning chamber feature does not cleanly empty chamber. Somewhat difficult to empty chamber into coffee maker without spilling the ground coffee. The Power cord is a little too short. The Dishwasher safe feature for grinding chamber parts is a definite plus. Overall, this is the best coffee grinder for the money that we have been able to find."
2,"Too small, makes a mess!","I really don't enjoy using this grinder. It makes a huge mess because the grounds stick to the grinding part and you have to tap it on the counter several times to get them to all come out. It barely holds enough for a pot of coffee, and if you overfill it (more than half full) it either shuts off or it doesn't ground all the beans. Coffee often gets stuck under where the button pushes so you have to unclog that area in order to make it work.Hey, I like coffee. I like a lot of dark, strong coffee and this coffee grinder just doesn't cut it!"
3,Sabotage?,"I have disliked other grinders because they trap so much of the ground coffee and they make a mess when trying to empty and clean. I bought this grinder primarily because it had a pouring spout and a cleaning device for the sides of the chamber. This was worse for emptying and cleaning than any other because the pouring spout and side-cleaning device trapped even more grounds than others. I could only think that the designers had deliberately done this to sabotage the brand! How is it possible that the company allowed this to get on the market without testing? Eventually, I learned to NOT use the pouring spot for emptying grounds -so it no longer traps them. The biggest improvement came after REMOVING the cleaning device with wire clippers! NOW I really enjoy this grinder because it grinds to my satisfaction, detaches from the motor portion, empties easily, cleans and even washes easily."
5,Great value! Does the job perfectly,"This is exactly what I needed. Grinds coffee and spices, nice variety of settings. Easy to clean. Can't beat it for the price."
1,Terrible Equipment with Gimmicky Features,"This is a terrible coffe grinder. It looks very space-age with lots of lights and switches, but its functionality stinks! It is difficult to clean, based mainly on the fact that the ""chamber maid"" cleaning system shredded after about 6 uses. Many of the beans after grinding are still whole. Wish I'd read the reviews here before buying this ""fancy"" piece of junk."
1,I hated it.,"I bought a new electric percolator (I got tired of the lousy coffee from drip coffeemakers) and because I needed a coarser grind than that readily available in grocery stores, I decided I would grind my own coffee beans to make coffee in it. I purchased the Mr. Coffee IDS77 from a local store. I hated it; it only had 3 grind settings, it was not easy to use, I had to stand there and hold the button till it stopped, the cord wrap was a royal pain, and worst of all some beans were ground to a fine powder but it also left big unground chunks of coffee bean at the completion of the coarse-grind cycle - - yuck! And it was difficult for me to disassemble, clean, and reassemble with arthritic hands (lots of twisting involved).After reading all the reviews here (thank you, fellow Amazon fans!) I ordered the Hamilton Beach 80374 Hands-Free for just a few more dollars and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! See my review at that product.Needless to say, I am returning the Mr. Coffee grinder."
1,Not as a daily grinder,I really wanted to keep this grinder but at the end I must return it.Deal breaker annoyances: Must hold button during grinding; Must stay plugged in else settings not remembered; If left plugged in appliance sips 0.1 amps just idling (what for?); basket designs means messy.
2,"Loud, Messy, Short Lived","I received this coffee grinder as a Christmas gift and lasted about 11 months before the grinder blade chewed up and broke the plastic scraping blades on the inside. In the time I used the grinder I was never a big fan: It was loud, had an inconsistent grind, messy (that could be my fault, I'm messy in the kitchen).I know I'm being very negative, but it is a serviceable, inexpensive grinder. It is not ideal for french presses. It might be good enough for coffee filters...that is, until it eats itself from the inside. It's probably great for herbs."
1,Only use with a paper filter,"I bought this before I knew anything about coffee. For not a lot of money more you can get a refurbished burr grinder that will be more consistent and leave less dust. The chamber maid cleaning system didn't do a great job because this pulverizes some of the coffee beans in order to crush the other beans. It doesn't have any way to control how coarse you want the beans except for how long you grind, so only use this for a paper filter drip pot - no espresso or french press."
1,Mr. Coffee grinder not for fine coffee,"I purchased this unit to grind coffee for expresso and found it does not grind to a ""fine"" ground. It has a ""fine"" setting but does not come close to actually pulling it off. The ""fine"" setting just grinds longer than the ""course"" and ""medium"" setting. Very disapointed."
1,Very poor coffee mill isd77,"Christmas present looked good. Sub-par operation and construction killed the joy. Grind timer did not work. Ground as long as button held down. Obviously not 'timed' as promised, so grinds as likely to turn out 'fine' as 'coarse' or 'medium.' So called 'Chamber Maid Cleaning system' required several minutes of hot water and soap to clean after use. Not easy. Actual chamber maid would have been fired before lunch. Chamber Maid system thin plastic and likely to give up as in earlier review. Does not clean coffee off the side of the chamber. Cord storage very poor. An excellent example of promises not kept, poor design and construction. Got to be a better one out there."
1,Horrible,I bought this coffee grinder because my son needed to have his formula thickened and I was instructed to grind the rice cereal...it broke in a week after daily use!
3,Short Power Cord,This unit works well but the power cord is so short that I have to hold it to be able to reach my power outlet. I will try to take it apart to install a longer power cord.
1,DO NOT BUY,"To say that the Mr. Coffee IDS77 is the worst coffee grinder ever made, is an insult to the worst coffee grinder ever made! This product simply does not do the job right. Even on the ""Fine"" setting, you have to run the beans through twice to get them all ground up. You have to continuously hold down the button on the top to get it to operate, unlike other coffee grinders on the market (Cuisinart, for one) where you just set it, start it and walk away. I would never recommend this product to anyone anywhere. Other coffee grinders are the same price, so save yourself time and headache, get one that does the job without having to babysit the darned thing!"
2,"Poor Results, Gimmicky, Overly Complicated","At around $20, this little blade grinder is cheap but suffers from a needlessly-complex design, poor performance, and useless gimmicky features.Here's why I returned mine:1. Too many piece-parts to lose, clean, assemble, and break.2. A very inconsistent grind (far too many ""fines"" along with medium and large particles) that can cause sour and/or bitter flavors.3. Difficult cleaning that can add stale/rancid flavors: many of those overly-fine grinds are impossible to remove because of the ""cleaner arms"" that don't actually work and are just in the way.4. A useless grind timer that requires you remain holding the power button while beans are over-processed on virtually every setting.CONCLUSION: 2 Stars instead of 1 because it is inexpensive and has lots of buttons and neato green LED lights!"
2,Disappointed,"It may have been a little too much to hope for a grinder that cleans itself. The only thing that the plastic blades intended for wiping the coffee off of the sides are good for is providing more surface area for coffee grounds to stick to. The removable cup and lid only become nuisances to fit back into place. Green lights that reflect the number of cups the maker is set to grind and the current grind setting only make me think that I'm unnecessarily using extra power (granted it's only pennies, but it's still waste). My last simple coffee grinder lasted 15 years. I don't think I'll last 1 year with this one."
2,Inconsistent results: unsuitable for French press coffee,"I purchased this for use with a French press coffeemaker, which requires coarsely-ground beans. Despite using the ""coarse"" setting on the Mr. Coffee grinder, it produced very inconsistent results. By the time most of the beans are at least coarsely-ground, half of them have already been pulverized to dust, which tends to clog the wire mesh in the French press. I returned the Mr. Coffee to Amazon for a refund."
2,Spend a few more bucks,"Spend a few more bucks.The cord is ridiculously short! 24 inches or so. As you have to hold the button down the entire time it grinds, you will probably need an extension cord or you must stand CLOSE to an outlet. My biggest complaint.The Chamber Maid Cleaning System is mediocre and just a bit functional. Not a real selling point and shouldn't have been used in the name of the product as such. I use a brush from an old system to get it all out,It does a good job at grinding. If that is all you're interested in, go for."
2,adequate,It does its job but is a so so product. You have to process the beans several times before they are ground properly. I wouldn't buy it again.
2,Rube Goldberg Grinder,"If you appreciate good design, do not buy this grinder.Why?- It's clunky- Has way too many unnecessary parts- The cord is so short that you'll probably have to unplug it every time to pour your coffee in your basket- If you use the hinged lid to pour the ground coffee through, you will end up with grounds on your counter- The chamber maid thing doesn't clean all of the grounds outThere are probably other bad points I could think of, but I'll save you the pain. On the up side, this thing actually grinds coffee pretty well. It's just not elegant, in the least bit. Stick with something simpler."
1,takes forever to clean,I bought this grinder due to reading all of the great reviews. But those cleaning blades really get in the way of cleaning the chamber. The coffee gets in back of the blades and I have to use a pastry brush to get all of the coffee out from behind them. It takes forever to clean or at least ten times as long. If it were not the cleaning blades I would have given it a much better rating.
3,Good little grinder,"This works well but it is not a burr grinder. You put the beans in the top cup, set the grind and time, then hold down the top button until the grinding stops. You then take the cup off the machine and pour the coffee into your filter. The problem is, no matter how much grinding, there is always a layer of big chips on top of the grounds when the coffee is done. I never see them when I look into the cup or in the filter after I pour the coffee in. The coffee always tastes good, though."
1,Garbage!,"Was excited when it showed up at my house, but honestly it worked 3 or 4 times then just stopped... I threw it away and went out and bought a different brand."
2,broke after 9 months of light use,"Bought this at walmart, but as it broke after only 9 months i figured i'd put a warning out. The grind selector buttons are supposed to select the grind coarseness-fineness and quantity being ground. After 9 months of using only on saturday and sunday, the equivalent of only 77 uses, the buttons no longer change the setting - it is stuck on a setting i don't use - cuts off too soon. now i have to run it until it stops and run it some more counting the seconds in my head. outside this problem it works well enough, for a blade grinder."
2,Didn't last long,"The motor overheated and no longer worked the first day I used it. I have a small Maxim grinder that I've used for many years and it still works fine. I stuff it full and it grinds really well but I wanted something that would grind more at a time. This one looked like it could do the job and I may have filled it a little over the ""fill"" line but didn't stuff it like I do my old one. Yet the old one still works and this one didn't make it a day. Stick with the cheap ones and take a little longer to grind your coffee, or spend more and get one that is meant to grind volume. It's not worth the trouble to send it back so I'll just go back to old reliable and consider it lesson learned. :)"
2,Works great! While it lasts...,"We purchased this grinder perhaps three months ago, and it works GREAT! It allows you to get just the grind you want, and just the amount you want, and you can take the chamber off the motor to clean it in the dishwasher, etc. It's really nice.For three months, that is. Last week, while grinding for 8 cups of coffee, there was a CRACK! and then the motor was running with no load. When I looked inside the chamber, one of the three ""arms"" of the Chamber Maid system had broken off. I took the chamber off the motor and found the gear underneath the chamber was broken in half.I guess three months for $25 is about right, but we have replaced it with a Bodium Burr grinder."
2,Revised design has serious flaws,"I bought an unit about 2+ years ago and after 2+ years of daily use, the chamber cleaning thingie broke, so I bought a replacement. To my surprise, they must have revised the plastic molding design because the lid does not have a good seal when closed. I have the old broken unit and new unit side by side and it's very clear there is a visible gap near the sprout on the new unit when the lid is fully closed! Why do I complain? Because I usually give it a light shake during grinding to loose grinds that stuck to one side. With this open gap, a light shake would cause grinds to come out of the chamber. In fact, it have not had a single session that I didn't need to clean up my kitchen counter because of the escaped grinds.I took the new unit back and swapped it and same issue on the second unit, which leads me to believe the plastic molding design got changed for the worse."
5,"Meets my high stands, after testing many others","This is a great grinder. And I've tested my fair share (I have practically created a new category of kitchen gadgets at my local thrift shop with all the grinders I've bought and discarded). The most important thing is that this machine will grind beans fine (meaning very small) and consistently. Amazingly, there are many grinders that don't."
1,Broken after 3rd time,"Plain and simple, product broke after the third time of usage. I followed instructions carefully and still it broke. Major disappointment."
3,Works like magic as long as it does!,Owned two of them in the last one year... bought from Target after a friend suggested its great for spices.. I use it very rarely for grinding spices and admit that it works wonders... Used the first one mildly for about 7 months and it broke all of a sudden... bought another one because i absolutely loved it and the second one lasted 3 uses only.. am very disappointed with it.. searching for a new more durable one for grinding spices at least...
4,great grinder!!,"I was looking for a replacement coffee grinder for my Capresso burr grinder. It works fine, but I was tired of cleaning up the mess on my counter each time I used it (and the static was Awful). The Mr Coffee grinder is Very easy to clean, there is No static and the price was right. Best grinder I have had (and I have had some very expensive top end one's)."
5,coffee grinder,"This is my first new coffee grinder in over a decade so this review reflects that.This grinder works very well so far, doesn't grind as much at once as my old grinder but is way cleaner, not getting grounds all over the counter and I really like the 'chamber maid' scraper, simple but effective. If this grinder lasts another decade I'll be a happy camper."
3,Grinds decently but hard to clean,"Perhaps I'm missing something, but even after rotating the three-clawed Chamber Maid cleaning device, there's lots of powder left everywhere in the grinding chamber. It's as messy as the old burr grinder I used to have. But on the other hand, the results I get are quite acceptable."
2,"Works well, looks good","After living with this thing for 6 months, I am forced to revise my review... It grinds extremely unevenly-- I frequently end up with whole beans and extremely finely ground coffee (and everything in-between)."
4,Great grinder for a clean freak!,"I have owned this grinder for several months an have found it to be a very good product. Several reviewers noted the ""extremely short cord"", I thought so too until the other day I decided to futz with it. Aha! I found that there is more cord VERY tightly wrapped around the interior of the base. Mystery solved!!I love flavored coffee so the fact that you can wash the grinder cup is FANTASTIC. The ""cleaning system"" does'nt scrape the bottom so I just use a pasrty brush to get all of the grounds out. The pour spout is not that great coffee tends to stick to the ridges on the inside of the pour spouts top, so again the trusty pastry brush to the rescue. It's noisy and scares the dog but most grinders are thats the nature of the beast. All in all this is a great little grinder,and for a clean freak like myself.... perfect."
2,Too many parts inside cup.Coffee gets stuck.,"This silly grinder has too many parts inside the cup. The parts are supposed to help clean out the cup. Instead, they actually help to hold coffee grounds in the cup. The lid even holds grounds. There are way too many contours in the cup. It cannot possibly be cleaned out. At all.Also, you actually have to stand there and hold a button down to operate the grinder. You can't walk away and get your lunch ready. You can't do anything, if it would require you to walk away from the grinder. How is this a good idea? Why in the world can't they have a switch that you turn on and walk away? It could turn itself off automatically, (We know this because that's what it does now; It turns itself off automatically).Summary - Pros: Cheap. <$20 Cons: Does not empty completely. Lots of extra plastic parts. User has to stand by it and hold button down to operate."
2,Waiting for it to die,"This grinder was a gift from my kind brother-in-law, who tried and failed to fix my 20-year-old Bosch a few years ago. It exaggerates the flaws of that old workhorse and adds more to the list.Pros:*faster than grinding by handCons:*leaves more large chunks and dust than other blade grinders I've used*timed grinding feature is absurd and useless for me*chamber has moveable plastic ribs (the ""Chamber Maid"" feature) that catch and hold powdery grounds and so are worse than useless as a cleaning feature--they broke off anyway*even noisier than others I've usedSo all in all I've found it to be an inelegant, needlessly complex, and noisy tool that fails to do a simple job acceptably. I think I've put up with it long enough!"
4,Good but doesn't completely grind,"Maybe the problem is just in expecting it to grind like a professional one. In my Mr. Coffee drip coffee pot even grinding it on fine does not completely grind, but in the end analysis I guess I can't expect perfection, nor it doesn't affect the taste of the final product."
3,Not Great,"Gave it 3 stars only because it was inexpensive and it would do OK for espresso only. The problems: the automatic control is useless unless you are making espresso. It will grind everything at every setting into a nice fine powder - not good for drip makers, and certainly bad for presses. I want press coffee, so I tried using manual control to stop and start the blades, even pulsing a bit to try to get good distribution of consistently sized grains. There was nothing I could do to get this. Every time there was a distribution of fine powder along with big chunks. Actually kind of par for the course with blade grinders, but I was expecting more with all the fancy controls. Just a blade grinder, and not bad for the price if you prefer espresso."
3,lasted almost 10 mths,"I just started grinding my own coffee about 10 mths. ago,so i saw thw reviews on this coffee grinder,I thought this will be the one! After 10 mths.,it just died. Went to do some griunding,and nothing. The lights indicating the amount of cups and the courseness were lit,but went to push the button to grind and nothing. I will now look fpr a burr grinder,which is supposed to give a much better tasting coffee. And also,there was a lot of clean-up after grinding was completed"
4,great product,"Product works as promised. Wish the cord were a little easier to work with but otherwise, it's great. I like the self timer so you don't have to wonder if the beans are ground enough."
4,Great Grinder,"The white one is hard to keep clean, but it grinds well and allows you to choose how fine/coarse you want to grind, plus you can remove the chamber for fairly easy cleaning."
3,"Worked great, and then it basically died","Ive had this for about 4 or 5 months. Ive been grinding things like cacao beans and dulse, not constantly, and then recently it basically stopped working. The motors runs and the blade spins (if nothing is in the chamber), but otherwise the blade doesnt really spin now at all."
2,Disappointing,"Not a bad grinder for the price but I thought it would do better than the blade grinder I was using. Although the lid secures it will pop off if not held down. The cord is way to short for kitchen use. The instructions say that the cord is short for safety sake of pets and the elderly. They don't seem to occupy my counters very often. Overall, it does grind coffee well but I don't see much of a difference the cup size grinds"
5,use it everyday,"This small, plugin coffee bean grinder is perfect for our needs. We use it everyday for our coffee beans and we have no complaints!"
1,the scrapers inside grinder break off.,"I thought this tool would be great after it was recommended by Consumer Reports. After several months though, the scrapers break off. Not only that, the plastic pieces end up in your coffee. Not healthy at all. Buy something else."
2,Messy Little Grinder,"This little grinder is difficult to use. The cord is too short (15"" includes the end of the plug), and it's very messy. The bowl scrapper does not scrap the bowl well. It's a real pain to use. I would not recommend this grinder."
3,"I'm sure it grinds well, after you figure it out.","For those who just want a simple grinder that just simply grinds, this may not be the best machine for you. When I get up and need coffee stat, that last thing I want to do is ""figure things out"" before I can have the coffee. What I want is:1) pour beans in grinder2) push button3) drink coffeeWhat I got was, pour coffee in, press button, nothing....Take apart, reassemble, make sure every thing is connected, push some buttons, nothing...After more button mashing, I finally got some beans ground, still not sure how that happened.If you go with this unit, maybe give the manual a read before crunch time."
3,Grinds coffee,What more can be said. You put ncoffee beans in...push the button and it grinds them up. Done!The only pain is that the cord is way too short. Annoyingly short. That's why it gets only 3 stars
1,"Just about acceptable for infrequent use, but the cleaning system actually makes it twice as hard to clean...","This is *okay* for infrequent use but there four major drawbacks which stop me from giving it a pass as a day-to-day product.1 - The ""chamber maid"" cleaning system is near-useless, it actually makes the whole thing harder to clean - especially bad if you're trying to grind other things such as spices or seeds - major flavor transfer.2 - It's really, really noisy.3 - The digital grind selection thing looks nice but it's just a timer at the end of the day - and it doesn't remember the setting when you switch it off, so it becomes annoying fast if you want to fine-grind things a lot.4 - The lid is fiddly and impractical, it's hard to get all the coffee out unless you remove it entirely.Quite simply, there are far better grinders than this for the same money."
3,Good as long as it works,"the bottom of the grinding chamber that attaches to the grind shaft, is plastic.the blades are attached to this plastic base. the plastic melted and the blades will not turn any more.small design flaw rendering the unit useless."
2,Chamber Maid feature not very durable,"I bought this coffee grinder about 8 weeks ago (not from Amazon.com) and it has been used twice a day regularly. The Chamber Maid system seems like a good idea, however it doesn't seem to be made in a durable fashion. One of the vertical bars that sweeps the side of the chamber has already cracked where it connects to the top ring. The grinder still works however, and I will use it until it is no longer functional."
3,As described...,"It is realy OK - it is not in great shape but it does the job. By picture you cannot tell how it works, so I accept the seller's evaluation. I would not put it for sale even for the price listed. I would give it away to Goodwill or Salvation Army. Not happy but this is my problem."
1,Messy and Cumbersome,"The grinder cleaner arms are useless - in fact, not only do they not keep the bowl clean, they require additional work to get them clean too.The flip top lid is useless - unless you like static electric charged coffee grounds flung over your counter.The electrical cord is useless - it is so short it won't even reach from the outlet to the edge of the counter.The grinder timer is useless - you still have to hold the switch on to make it operate - not that it's a big woo, but if there are going to be bells and whistles for a timer - at least make it stop on it's own.The cover and bowl mechanisim is very cumbersome to reassemble.All in all - the grinder is not worth having.I returned mine."
3,could have saved the money,"My blender does the same thing. Just another piece to find a place for in the kitchen. Does not work that great, too small."
3,coffee bean grinder,"Seems to work fine, but when you use it the bucket is coated with coffee, and it's not like I am going to wash it every day, so buying it pre-ground sure seems a lot easier."
2,Good...while it lasted...,"I was looking for a spice grinder and this came up as one of the grinders in the amazon search. After purchase, the manual informs that it could only be used for coffee beans. I am not much of a coffee drinker hence, used it for grinding spices only. Did not last longer than 4 months. Got burned out...when powdering sugar for baking. Guess it can only be used for coffee beans. Worked fine while it lasted."
1,Bugger,"Bugger ! Lessoned learnt , always find out the volts an hertz when purchasing electrical items.This grinder shorted in a cloud of smoke when used using Australian 240V / 50 Hz.Maybe make these ratings more promenant in the advertisement........."
2,it suckssssssssssssssssssssss,"i got this grinder from lowes store yesterday, got the extra year replace/return warrenty so i will be returning it real soon once i get a new one.my suggestion, DO NOT BUY THIS!! spend the extra 15$ and get a good one."
2,Basket gone in one year,"We purchased this grinder less than a year ago and it worked well. But eventually, the plastic of the cleaning basket wore out. I had read other reviews here and noted that others had called Mr. Coffee about this and recieved a replacement basket from them for free. So with this information, I called Mr. Coffee, but they were out of replacement baskets. To my surprise, they sent me a hole new grinder, absolutely FREE. It was a BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, which was much better quality than the one I had. Kudos to Mr. Coffee's customer service. This kind of service creates satisfied customers. I will write a review on the new one after I have used it for a while."
3,Not a bad deal,"It is not as noisy as other grinders I've owned, grinds beans to the perfect consistency for espresso, and is *very* easy to clean. The only drawback is that the ""convenient"" pour spout is not that convenient. It's pretty large and the lid will not stay up unless you hold it at an awkward angle. It's ok for the cofee maker basket, but when I try to pour the grounds into the little basket for my espresso maker, I still tend to spill coffee all over the countertop."
5,love it!,Does the job perfectly...very little noise. Three different settings are great! Would recommend!
5,Coffee grinder,Only have used it once and...so far so good. I like the options to select the amount of coffee for the cups that are being brewed and the option for the type of grind you want. Easy to clean.
1,Too Bad It Didn't Work,"I ordered the IDS77 on the strength of a Consumer Reports review. They felt that, as a blade grinder, it did a pretty passable job of equaling the performance of a burr grinder. Perhaps their sample did, but my unit was Dead on Arrival DOA). The problem was the grinder wouldn't run because the actuator button was faulty. I sent it back to Amazon at no charge (what a great company) and selected a Hamilton Beach 80374. It was a few dollars more but I've had no problems with it and it looks great."
1,Worked twice,"I purchased this for work at my office and it lasted less than a week. I double checked the instructions and consulted with fellow co-workers to ensure I wasn't using it wrong, but it just turned out it had broken after two uses."
3,"Fair, But Not Great","This coffee grinder, with all its bells and whistles, works only moderately well. Following the directions exactly, it often leaves beans ""unground"" in the well. I'd prefer a grinder that allows ME to determine how long to grind rather than letting the grinder decide. Yes, I can choose to grind for a shorter amount of time than is pre-programmed, but that's never the issue. The issue is always that the beans need to be ground MORE than the pre-programmed time.It has been my experience that Mr. Coffee products are overpriced and never live up to expectations. I also found their customer service to be seriously lacking. The last Mr Coffee 4-cup coffee maker I purchased lasted less than a year yet their customer service would do nothing to assist me or help with my disappointment. I bought this grinder because it was on sale; I should have listened to my instinct."
2,Lasted a little over a year,"I did actually like the grinders design. It was nice to disconnect the chamber for pouring into the filter and the cleaning mechanism was helpful to loosen the coffee. But within a week of buying it the ability to set the number of cups and degree of fineness stopped functioning. I should have returned it then but it was still performing satisfactorily.Recently however it started being picky. I'd have to unplug and replug it back in to get it to work. Today that stopped working too. It isn't acting like a problem in the power cord more like some sensor or other internal component no longer working as designed.Oh well, next I'll try one with a simpler design, but I don't expect better reliability. It seems all manufacturers want us to replace such things every year or two."
3,Grinding grains and spices,"I bought this to grind grains and spices and it works very well. The only issue with it is lining up the top perfectly so you can push the grinding button. Once you can get it lined up, it's great."
1,Poor material,"The ""Chamber Maid Clean System"" is good idea, but it easy to broken. When I was grinding coffee (only two tea spoon), the plastic parts broken suddenly and fall into coffee bean."
4,"This is a CHOPPER, NOT A GRINDER.","Okay, first let me say I really hate it when they call a chopper a grinder. Grinders have two surfaces that grind the beans into the preset size, using a gap to ensure that nothing falls through until it is as small as you want: choppers use blades that beat the beans to death for a while, so you get some very fine powder mixed in with some large chunks.That said, this is a good chopper. It produces as uniform a chop as any I've seen, much better than most. And for the price, it's a real deal if you aren't using it for espresso, french press, or other uses that require a very uniform result."
2,K.I.S.S.,"Keep it simple, stupid. Certainly applies here. Chamber maid cleaner is held together by thin plastic strips that break easily. Never really scraped all the coffee of the bottom anyway. Grind size selector is just a gimmick, much easier just to grind until you get the grind size you desire by holding down a bottom and taking a peak. Take my advice and go with a simple model. You'll be happier in the long run. I give it 2 stars because it actually grinds coffee. It just does so in a more difficult way, and to me, that's just the wrong approach."
2,Not recommended,This grinder is not very good. It does not produce a fine grind which I prefer to use as I use paper filters. The grinder is also very difficult to clear. All the Chamber Maid Cleaning system does is get in the way and make it very difficult to clean the ground coffee out with a small brush. I do not recommend this machine for those reasons.
1,Disatisfied,The second time I used the grinder the programming feature failed to work. It did grind the beans by holding down the button. I am disappointed that it failed as I liked the features.
3,Just OK,"I've had this grinder for about 6 months. My biggest issue with it is that I get a very uneven grind. Lately I've ended up with chunks of whole beans. Also, the electrical cord is way too short."
4,Does what its made for,"Had this grinder for over a year. Love it! Sure its loud, but you get what you pay for. Got it to grind my beans for my french press. Fill, grind, remove and pour. Too easy.Only issue is now the plastic cleaning arms in the chamber broke off. Still grinds. Consistency is still adequate."
4,Coffee Grinder,"The coffee grinder does really well, enjoy the fact that it turns off when it is done and don't have to guess at when to stop grinding. The coffee beans are fairly consistent in the ground sometimes get a few pieces a little bigger. When using the expersso is a residue at the bottom of the pot, no big deal you can pour it through a paper filter and that takes care of it. Overall, it is a good product and worth the money spent."
5,not bad at all!!!,"my wife bought this because she loves to make espresso and all the other products she had used for that purpose were absolute failures... we thought about purchasing a more expensive machine but could not bring ourselves to pay hundreds of dollars just to grind beans for espresso a few times a week...what a shock - it worked!! even our son-in-law, another espresso lover, was amazed at how much better my wife's espresso-making skills became after using this grinder!just to show you how happy we are with the product, we are going to buy a second grinder for our son-in-law!we have had the grinder for a couple of months so I am unable to report on whether the grinder will hold up to long-term use..."
2,Worked fine for a little over a year,It worked fine for a little over a year. It was used nearly daily. Just stopped working one morning. Smells like the motor burnt out.
2,Gimmicks don't add value,"It's a blade grinder and works OK, but the Braun product grinds better. Grind quality is quite uneven at the recommended settings - need to grind quite a bit longer to get it more uniform, but then it will be quite fine. The automatic timing seems like a nice feature, but it has to be set every time you plug it in - easier just to grind by ear. The chamber maid feature doesn't really clean out the bowl, but it gets enough out that you don't have to brush it out just to make your coffee. Mine broke in less that two months and then it jams up the lid. It's not so bad with a relatively full load, but when grinding enough for a cup or two a lot of the coffee winds up under the lid and has to be brushed out anyway. Having the removable bowl is nice but the lid part is fiddly to assemble. I quickly got fed up and spent the extra money for a quality burr grinder."
5,Mr Coffee -- coffee grinder,Gave this as a Christmas gift. Recipient loved it! Very nice item. Delivered quickly.
1,Uneven grind,"I am very disappointed in the grind quality. After following the instructions I end up with unevenly ground beans. Not good. Also, the machine is not nearly as easy to clean as the product subscription suggests."
1,Difficult to clean,It grinds well enough the timer is nice if you have no idea what you are doing and can't learn how long to grind your beans after a few attempts. The big downside for me was the time it takes to clean it out. I may have a little OCD I don't know but I like the grinder to be clean (relatively) before each use meaning I wipe it out with a dry cloth. The cup of the grinder has different plastic pieces in it you won't find in most grinders which makes it a pain to clean out. I have a very simple cuisinart grinder at home and it works just fine I use the Mr Coffee grinder at work because my wife decided she didn't like it (after she bought it). So I would recommend almost any other simple grinder over this one.
2,"Grinds fine, poorly designed","This thing grinds well, but the grind settings are entirely pointless (you still have to hold down the grind button the whole time) and the cleaning system is hokey and awkward. Have you ever had a moment of appreciation for the way subtle details in design make some products a joy to use? This is not one of these products. I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Mr Coffee Grinder,"This is the worst product I have ever used. In the description and on the box it states ""it is great for coffee & spices"", but the instructions state for best results ""only grind coffee, do not grind nuts or SPICES""! It does not bring out the flavor of the coffee. I have read and re-read the instructions and do exactly what they tell you to do. I had a Cuisinart similar to: DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill. It was a VERY good product even those the reviews were not that good. I had it for almost 4 years and used it just about every day. Four years, everyday would be over 1400 grinds. I think it needed to be cleaned (never cleaned it) and started to have issues and then I think I broke it, unintentionally. Amazon is good with their policies and the products that they sell. I will be calling them to see if they can help me out with this piece of garbage."
2,Failed first time it was used. Returned for refund.,"I read many of the reviews here on Amazon for this (and other) grinders before making a purchase. Since I have owned several types (Braun has been the overall best) over the past 30 years, I knew what I was looking for. This one seemed to fit the bill: Less expensive, larger grinding volume, quieter, longer lasting, etc.Well, I was disappointed with it. It took what seemed forever to grind the beans to the fine consistency necessary for our machine. Then, after grinding about two cups of beans (we keep a few days worth of the ground beans in an airtight container), it completely stopped working. I am not sure if it was defective or just not capable of grinding properly. I am thinking it was the latter.I sent it back and am not taking a chance on another one of these. I'm looking to purchase a better quality unit."
4,Good Coffee Grinder at a Good Price! Recommended!,"The Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder performs well and is a very good value for the price. There are few things better than the smell and taste of fresh ground coffee and this grinder makes short work of the task.This is a fairly sturdy and well made appliance that I expect will last a long time (will update this review if thats not the case).The marketing is accurate as the clean-up is easier than other coffee grinders we have used. That was a pleasant surprise!Overall, I am very pleased with this coffee grinder and even happier about the low price! Recommended!"
2,"Works well, but don't expect it to last forever","I bought one of these grinders two years ago, and it worked perfectly for exactly one year. After 12 months of gentle use, the plastic ""chamber cleaning system"" broke, causing bits of ground plastic to be mixed in with my ground coffee.I figured it must have been a fluke, so I went out and bought another one. 10 months later, the exact same thing happened -- the chamber cleaning system broke into pieces, and those pieces were subsequently ground up with my coffee beans.There's not much else I can say about this grinder that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. It's a good grinder for the first 10-12 months... but after that, you're on borrowed time. I won't be buying another one."
