2,Don't bother,It kind of works. It makes the water bead up on the glass a bit but it left a film on the window that created a lot of glare. The film came off after a few washings but so did most of the beading. It doesn't do anything to make the windows stay cleaner or clean easier. I wouldn't bother using it again.
1,Not the best windshield treatment out there.,"Too bad it is not better, since it is simple to use. So, I have tried almost any product out there similar to Clarity Defender. I have tried Rain X, Aquapel, Diamondite and 4 or 5 other products. All of them never lasted as long as a similar product from NanoSafeguard. It is also cheap since I can use it for almost every glass surface of 2 whole cars."
3,The Rose Tattoo,This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift for my sister. I have not seen the film and have not received any feedback from her as yet.
2,Overstated size,The price is good. But the size is not close to what has described. It is much smaller. It looks and feels 14K gold. But it is thin as a sheet metal. I don't need the fancy jewelry boxes for this kind of pendant. I guess that's where the money went.
4,Hammer hits it,"A wonderful performance by Peter Cushing in ""Cash on Demand"" dominates this collection, but most of the rest of the films are enjoyable as well. Hammer Studios had a remarkable record of churning out movies that were not always great, but very seldom were they actually bad. This collection typifies the studios style, with generally well made movies containing reasonably good performances."
3,....$15 Bucks..!,"...For 6 Lippert/Hammer/VCI Noirs..Way Cool, Jr..!...All The Hammer Horror, Noir & Suspense Series In My Collection..Get 'Em All Before They Are Gone 4-Evha..!"
4,Great but NOT for rabbits,"FYI,This is a very cute house for animals, but the large size is so small, my rabbit can't even fit his head in the doorway let alone fit inside it. This would be ok for a Guinea pig, but it is a small space. Only a baby rabbit could fit in it."
4,Fun Zombie Romp,"This game is pretty well engineered for running a zombie apocalypse game at your table. The rules are perhaps a little bit heavy for a one-shot adventure, and I personally don't see running zombie games as a regular game, but that's a pretty minor complaint. This is not to say that it is a rules heavy experience, just that one-shots work best if there isn't a new rule-set to learn for a single adventure.I definitely recommend this game to fans of the zombie apocalypse genre."
4,zombies everywhere,"Just as promised, a role playing set up for zombie invasions. I found the phase virus (modeled after aids) and the ""green"" products that raised the dead particularly entertaining."
3,"Bad taste, and not in a good way.","For the most part, this is a solid RPG. It serves up exactly what you asked for, and is unflinching in it's blatant homage to zombie flicks of the past four decades. Many thumbs up. However, I have to point out that the book has a story scenerio that is tasteless and could have been left out of the book. This is the ""P.H.A.D.E to Black"" storyline, which exploits HIV in a way that is truly pointless. Have a little heart and respect for the real world and get rid of this for future editions, guys."
5,TOTALLY CHIVALRY!,"This is the best king of music. Who ever is into knights and jousts and Camelot should really listen to this great combination of midevil music. It is the best. Trevor Jones is brilliant with conduction and Sting did a great job singing ""The Mighty."" Maia Sharp and B.B. King and Zucherro also did well. If you like insturmental music than you will love this!"
4,Hip Hop review,"This CD has 3 tracks. The first track Hip Hop is very good with a deep evil base that goes right through you. The multimedia video of that same track is also very good, has a revolutionary let's get straight feel about it. Dead Prez are very refreshing compared to the mainstream glitzy, fake and lazy hip hop that seem to just flood the market. Get this CD!"
2,The truth about the author Bob Nelson.,"I was married to Bobby Nelson.He beat me and he was a liar.He may be a talented writer, but he can not tell the truth in real life.He was an drunk and wife beater when he was married to me.I hope he has changed."
3,Where was the editor?,"Breslin's important message is diminished by the poor quality of some of the writing... as he rants and rages, many sentences just aren't sentences, the grammar and words sometimes just don't make sense, and you find yourself wondering what he meant to say... Where the heck was the editor? even the free-flying thoughts just sometimes don't seem to have any cohesiveness. He'll make a point, using certain language, then several pages later it's the same story all over again, with the same language...didn't he realize he already said that? and sometimes one sentence has nothing apparently to do with the preceding one. The confusion I had reading this book diminished the books impact. Breslin has a very important story to tell, so why reduce the impact by sloppy editing. PLEASE revise for the second edition to clear up what the heck some of the sentences are meant to say and why they're placed where they are!"
3,Angry Jimmy,"I have been a reader of Jimmy Breslin for as long as I can remember. There has always been an angry edge to his writting (he hates dogs).His anger is not hidden in this book; in fact, it gets in the way of the important story.If you are Catholic and can deal with Jimmy's emotional outburst you should or should I say must read this book.The clergy will be forced to hand over the church to the laity in the future but by that time it will be financially and morally bankrupt. When this happens you can't say that Jimmy Breslin didn't warn you."
2,from a friend,"I am a principal in the Diocese of Brooklyn. I have had the honor and pleasure of working with Barbara Samide when she was my principal. To have her career abruptly cut short because of a person such as John Thompson was a gross injustice to her, her family, and the students in her school.For a prize-winning journalist such as Jimmy Breslin, however, I was quite surprised to find a number of inaccuracies in the chapter about the Burke family; a quality journalist should do his research more thoroughly and check his facts before having a book published. Also--was it really necessary to print the details of John Thompson's sexual assault?? Was the lure of selling books more important than protecting a woman's dignity and privacy?"
4,The Awful Truth,Jimmy Breslin provides a magnificent indictment of the evils perpetrated in the name of God on His/Her most innocent and vulnerable children by churchmen more enamored with earthly power and gold than heavenly treasures. Too bad that his mile-a-minute style may put off some readers who aren't used to it. This book deserves a wide readership.
5,Strong,"Ive always found Jimmy Breslin to be an amazing writer, but in this work of literature he made it crystal clear that the churches sexual abuse stories were not an urban myth. The real life accounts you will hear in this book are repulsive, and shocking. He explains it to you in such a way that it hits you right in the stomach. I personally know many of the people he talks about, and trust me when i say this, everything he says is the truth."
5,Brilliant and on fire!,"I kept waiting for somebody--preferably a Catholic--to make sense of the pedophile scandal within the Church, and here at last is that book. This book burns with all rage, bitterness and feeling of betrayal that the daily newspaper headlines never captured. It's like the autobiography of a Catholic during a very disgusting time in the life of the church. Leave it to Breslin to tell it like it is--the powerful princes of the church are the ones who abandoned Christ and what He taught and stood for, and took advantage of the people. It's practically Biblical, the stories he tells are so unforgettable. This is a must-read."
5,Big Props to Scarface,Without a doubt Scarface is one of My All-time Favorite MC's. He truly brings His Own Flavor & vision on these tracks from over the years.I dig His Story-telling & Presentation.He takes on so many different aspects of Life&just lets it all flow. This is a Solid Collection of His Career thus far.
4,4 stars cuz it's Face... 3 if you judge the selection.,"Umm.. Scarface is the man. That's why this gets 4 stars. If you look at the selection though of ""greatest hits"".. um.. no. These are not his greatest hits. Some good tracks on here, but definitely not his best. I hate it when people make these compilations because I know I could do them better. Every time. Someone hit me up and ask me to make their greatest hits CDs, because every time I make a mix tape of any artist it comes out tight. I choose the jams, not the ""hits"". Oh well. For a real Scarface experience, get ""The Diary"", or ""Last of a Dying Breed""."
5,Heartland,Wonderful! Age appropiate. My horse loving pre-teen is really enjoying them. She started with the #1 series. We are ordering 5 series at a time.
4,heartland after the storm,This book is a very good but I think it could of had a better ending because it would be so sad to see someone read this amazing bookand end not finshing it because it is so sad and such a bad ending. Most people like a ending where the person who really wants something it better when they get it.So if you ever read this book you should finsh it to the end because there is no story better than a sad story because it exspress you r true emotions
5,Great,"I love this CD so much that I can't think of what to say about it. For starters, the voices are wonderful - the combination of licoricey baritone, cool sopranos and spare instrumentals is both sensual and stark; the harmonies, sometimes only one note apart, are happy puzzles for the ear. More than the physical beauty of the music though, are the tales - familiar but told in an unfamiliar tongue and couched in the exotic imagery of pagan Iceland. This is like music in a dream - you know it but it's utterly strange and for me, mesmerizing."
4,Great collection but uneven,"First, I think this is a great collection of music. It captures the mystery and lure of the Norse Myths in a way which is otherwise unheard of with the possible exception of Svenbjorn Beintenssen's recordings from the 1970's.However, I found the quality of the music somewhat uneven. Some of the longer ones performed by Benjamin Bagby were extremely well done. Some of the others seemed like they were mostly ""Gregorian Chant in Old Norse."" Bagby's performances seem to be generally well done elsewhere too (I highly recommend his performance of Beowulf on DVD).All in all, it is a unique CD and one I would highly recommend to people interested in Norse myth."
4,Ryewire's first CD,"These Days, a CD EP with six songs, is a good first effort by this Seattle band. Two songs were played on local radio (The Funky Monkey) ""These Days"" and ""Kasparov's Defeat"". Those two singles and the song ""Consideration"" are the highlights of this album in my opinion; however, the drummer totally rocks throughout the whole CD.If you like the Seattle sound, this CD is worth joining your collection."
3,"OK, too much talking","I actually took the first class in person and I thought this would be a good follow up for more routines. not the case. Its alot of talking and doing promo for their series of DVD's and not alot of meat to show you how things are done. Its too bad, it could have been done Much better"
1,No Exotic Chair Dancing here,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. Hip rolls and eye contact was the main focus of their instruction. With the titles of ""Master Instructors"" I was anticipating a more moves, instructions and routines. This was more of an instruction video for someone never exposed to chair or exotic moves. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
5,Love the snaplok,This is my first Bianchi holster and the quality is great. I love the location of the release lever it makes for easy draw.
5,Very practical and informative,"I used this book as a textbook, when I was taking ""College Study Skills"" Course in my college. It helps the readers to develop skills such as notetaking, creating visual aids, preparing for exams, time management, identifying your learning style, and using the best of your memory. The book helped me a lot and I enjoyed it very much. I encourage teachers and students to use this book and I recommend it highly to anyone, who wants to become a better learner."
5,Excellent,"I volunteered to read for the blind students at my college and discovered this book. Excellent presentation, great work up on all aspects of learning tools and skills. I am using the memory section of this book in the writing of my own book on credit card debt and budgeting. This would be a good book for a homeschooled student or high school student to read as well as for college students as they prepare for a good educational experience. A students work twice as hard as other students or they learn ways to work smarter. The second way gives you more ""living"" time."
2,It's been driving me mad!,"This gorgeous book would be great, if not for a glaring error in the first sentence. Penguins don't live in the Arctic! Therefore they would never come in contact with polar bears! The furtherest north they live is the Galapogas Islands, so we're not even talking about the same hemisphere let alone the same continent. I like showing this book to my 2 year old but everytime I read the first sentence it puts me off for the rest of the story. If the author ever checks these reviews, I hope he writes a revised edition, cos' apart from this it's a beautiful book."
2,ehhhhh... not what I expected,"If your reading this, its a 99% chance that you heard Juno Reactor uses Psychoslaphead as an alias. That is true. I say that because almost anyone who has heard this CD would hardly recommend it by word of mouth. I have tremendous respect for Juno Reactor, but this is not even in the same universe as other Juno songs.Basically this is a remix CD of 1 song. The first mix is my favorite ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", but its hard to differenciate between the others because they sound so much the same (even for a remix.)I gave this CD two stars only because I'm a huge fan of Juno. But don't kid yourself. IF you arn't a die-hard electronic music head, then stay far away from this CD. There are much, much better albums to be had."
1,"...um, yeah...","i have to agree with ""Mike"" that is isn't a good album, though i picked it up only because i saw it was on the Wax Trax! label. Luckily i only spent 50 cents on it. I would be very disappointed with myself had i spent any more. It is a remix of one song broken up into too many songs with misleadingly different titles. Not worth buying, not really even worth listening to for free."
1,Doesn't work,I ordered this because my boyfriend and I make cappuccino every morning and can't get enough foam from our machine. THis frother didn't give us any froth at all- all it did was stir the milk at high speed. Worthless and a waste of money.
3,"Handy, if a little underpowered.","Since I don't generally put frothed milk on my coffee, I tend to use to mix and fluff cold chocolate or even plain milk. (I find it works much better if you put your milk in a tall, narrow glass.) My major complaint is that my cold milk beverages don't stay frothy for very long, so I have to drink them up quick if I want to enjoy their frothy goodness. I also find the power switch to be complicated to turn on (its ""on"" vs. ""off"" position is impossible to tell by looking at it)."
1,Useless,i bought this bodum frother from a local store thinking it was cheap and should be effective.but this frother is nothing when compares to aerolatte.this has no power and doesnt froth perfectly even after 2 min's.Waste of money.
2,Not as good as the aerolatte,"Seeing the low price, I bought one of these to replace my ageing aerolatte milk frother. A mistake. It doesn't look as nice, last as long or, more importantly, froth as well or as quickly. A false economy. Sorry, Bodum, you may be great in french presses but the sepcialist aerolatte company seems to do this sort of thing a lot, lot more effectively."
1,Where is the froth??,"I used to have a Bodum Aerius tall milk frother. I loved it. It was simple, didn't use batteries, and made great froth. A friend of mine loved it so much I gave it to her when she left for overseas. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.I received this frother as a free bonus on Amazon. As the other reviewers have indicted, it doesn't have a manual. I did figure out how to put the batteries in, but after a few attempts I am REALLY disappointed in the froth. It went down immidiately after I removed the frother -- I had ""frothed"" it for a good 2 minutes. That was more than enough for my old hand opperated frother. As I indicated, I received this frother for free. If I had paid for it, I would certainly return it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Thank goodness I got this so-called frother for free when I purchased my new Cuisinart coffee maker or else I'd be upset. This thing is like a child's toy. It's messy and worse yet: ineffective. Do not, repeat, NOT waste your money on this thing."
3,There are better,"Bought this frother for the looks (I liked the cool translucent exterior!). But there are better frothers on the market. Problem with this one is the head is plastic with deep ridges - it often splatters the liquid, much more so than others made of metal do. Still, the price is right... Spring for a few bucks more and get one with a metal stick."
1,Save your money,"I bought this trying to find a cheap way to froth milk. No matter what I tried (hot, cold, low-fat, half & half) it never made anything close to froth. I've had better luck just using a small shaker. If you use a shaker with a capacity about double the amount of milk you put in, and shake for about 30 seconds, you will get results as good as any manual or electric frother. I ordered a Hamilton Beach espresso maker based on good reviews and low price, and I am looking forward to real steam generated froth."
1,My Mistake,"Every so often, one makes the mistake of believing an advertisement (editorial review) and bites! The product arrived with minimal instructions (4 unclear pictures indicating the need to purchase another Bodum product in hope that this contraption might actually work). If there were an option for negative stars, it would rate a minus 5. Well, at least it's fun to make a mess with!"
1,Not safe,"I ordered two of these chairs and two of the armed windsor chairs. They are unstable and unsafe. The legs are loose enough to split out from underneath anyones weight. The picture shows an arm bracing the two back legs but the chairs I received do not have this. They are very poorly made. This item deserves no stars and will be shipped back, at my cost, tommorow."
5,This is a MUST HAVE for any music lover!,"We were originally given this CD two years ago by a pilot of a South African Airline. It is a fabulous compilation of songs, both fun and energetic as well as soothing. We gave our copy away to a restaurant that we felt would like to play it for their customers and have been looking for it ever since. It will be wonderful to own again!!!!"
5,Buy this album !,"I can't believe more people are not listening to this. Must say the second track is my least favourite but love the rest. I cannot listen to 'Weeping ' without bursting into tears. It is such a beautiful song, and so relevant even to today, where many governments are still trying to lie to the outside world about what they are doing to people ( eg Guantanomo Bay ). I wish the whole world will listen to and appreciate this song. And the rest of the album is so vibrant and joyful it just lifts your heart."
2,Ho Hum,"Out of all the Pink Floyd books, this one is a slow read and pretty dull. There's much better ones out there."
2,mediocre,"I love Debussy, but this recording doesn't capture the soul of his music very well. Though I enjoy a couple of the pieces in this album, overall I'm dissatisfied with the arrangements which seem to lack feeling, emotion, captivation, and really musical substance of any sort. ""Reverie,"" for example, is a wonderfully amazing song, but the arrangement on the cd fails to capture the intensity of the piece that I've heard with other arrangements. The same can be said for most of the other pieces which tend to just seem very bland. Overall, there are far better Debussy albums out there--choose one of them."
2,disapointment,I could not wait to hear this cd as I usually love Debussys music but I was realy disapointed with this cd I felt really let down I am no expert in classical music but I am giving my own honest oppinion of this cdgerald Doyle
4,Debussy IS for Relaxation,"This CD's title says it all - just for relaxation.Debussy is for soul searching time, contemplation of the universe or just vegging out.If this is what you're looking for you've found it."
4,Good.,"When I first saw the movie i loved the songs THUNDERKISS 65, BOOGIE KING, LIVING DEAD GIRL, and CRAZY (the other's were good, but these were my favorites). I discovered LDG wasn't on it I became a little unsure... I found it at a Dave's Video for $4.99. I was into artists like AC/DC, OZZY, KISS, and MEGADETH. I wasn't sure if I would trade it in some day when I needed some money, I am still not sure. should I Buy it?"
3,"I own this, buuuuut......","it's not one of my favorites. This is only okay to listen to once in a long while:1. Alright.2. Possibly the best song.3. I heard better.4. Okay.5. Not Judas Priest's best.6. Boooorrriinnnggg.7. Slayer sucks after 1988.8. The start is cool but the rest sucks.9. Powerman 5000 exaggerates.10. It's kind of lame.11. ""So Real"" is a whole lot better than this.12. I only listened to it once to this day.13. Damn Patsy Cline Wannabes!14. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!It's a lot worse than expected it to be. It could only be a millimeter more of a crappy song and I would give it 2 well deserved stars. But I can only give it 3 stars because of a couple of good songs on this entire cd."
4,"Listener gets lucky, well almost","This album is great, it has some really terrific tunes on it perfect for a killing spree, just kidding. The only parts I didn't like was the omission of Living Dead Girl and that depressong, pathetic, Love You to death. Definately check out We belong Dead it is an amazing movie mix by Graeme Revell"
5,Pretty Cool!,"This CD is cool, but why the hell isn't that Rob Zombie song on here??? I mean, even at the beginning of the movie there was a little thing that said ""Title song performed by Rob Zombie."" Why do those stupid idiots do that? That was the best song."
1,Not as described,"I purchased this table on the description that is was 'solid hardwood' made of chinese ruberwood. When I received the table I discoverd that it was actually just a particle board top and well, I am not sure what the base is made of as it did not arrive with the table. The table top was also cracked horizantally on the edge which also tells me that the particle board is not glued together well. The finish looks more like an oak grain finish rather than a smooth 'honey antique' finish. All in all not as advertised. I returned it for something a bit more solid."
2,Damaged table,I just received the table today and it came damaged and with not enough hardware to put it together! The table came chipped and scraped and looks terrible!
3,Beautiful table albeit incomplete.,"This table is flat-out gorgeous! It was an amazing bargain. However, it was missing pieces when it arrived, and was not packed well at all. The box had opened and there was slight damage. I decided it was not worth the hassle of trying to exchange, so I got clever and created the piece that was missing (the piece that joins the table and legs.)If packaged properly, I'm certain those problems would not be an issue. It's really a very pretty and sturdy table."
4,Another Wonderful Book From Dorothy Garlock,"I discovered Dorothy Garlock's work about a year ago when her book ""With Hope"" kept calling to me every time I walked by it in the book stores. I was so delighted in that book that I have been grabbing them every time I find one by her. No need to read the name or even what the story line is about - if it is by Dorothy Garlock it's a good read."
1,I hated the violence in this book,"This was my first Dorothy Garlock book, and it was too violent for me, I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. I like Historical Romance books that make me feel good. This one sure didn't. I felt sick to my stomach over all the yelling and physical battering and violence, rapes, near rapes and killings of Milo(Louis wasn't much better). And when Milo beat Dories face up so horribly and ground a little kittens head to pulp under the heel of his boot, that finally did it for me,(that happened on page 187)and thats when the book made it into the garbage can. I have never found violence to be entertaining. I certainly do not see how anyone could give this book a five star, they sure have a stronger stomach than I have. I would have given this book a zero if I could have."
4,Sins Of Summer,"I had read and enjoyed this book years ago. I love her work and this book was just as good as I remembered. Nice period piece, good stories and charectors I liked. If you like historical romances her work is great."
2,Too Cosy for Comfort,"There was just too much here to believe. An eccentric 102 year old millionairess disinherits her family, and leaves all her money to her part time assistant, genealogist Torie O'Shea. Shortly thereafter, Torie becomes the object of jealousy and hate. Someone beats Torie up with a baseball bat in broad daylight in a very public place, but no one, including Torie sees the attacker. Even the ending was not like something that would happen in ""real life"". I read the entire novel, but when I finished it I asked myself ""why?"""
2,disappointing,"mrbob was slow to reply to my first email inquiring about the arrival of the cd however, he eventually did ut to tell me it was lost. so i never got it but i was refunded all of my money proptly."
4,A worthy alternate to Reich's own recordings,"It's generally true that different versions of a piece of music emphasize different aspects, but perhaps more true of Steve Reich's landmark 'Music for 18 Musicians' because it's so densely layered. The Ensemble Modern recording has more of a live feel than either of Reich's own, with the marimbas, xylophones and winds mixed more up front compared to the pianos and voices. Both of the Reich recordings seem to mix all instruments with equal emphasis, creating a monolithic ensemble sound. Ensemble Modern is sloppier than Steve Reich and Musicians, with very occasionally a ragged tempo or a note off key. In the main, though, the playing is very solid. Some of the rhythms have a cooking, almost-pop feel. Altogether I'd rank the this rendition up there with Steve's original ECM recording, putting his recent Nonesuch version third."
2,"MUDDY, MUDDY TONE","This pedal works ok for practicing. If you have an amp with no distortion whats so ever, I guess this will get the job done. But I STRONGLY advise against recording using this pedal. Have tried to run it to an amp and mic it. Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device, and the result is always the same: a god-awful, horrible-sounding muddy tone that cannot be helped with all the EQ in the world. It is not good for metal, or any other genre for that matter. I realize it is probably not meant to record with, but i feel that anybody who is searching for a good studio guitar tone should certainly look elsewhere. If you have a combo amp, the distortion on it is probably way better than you will get with this pedal. BOSS makes some great products, but this is definitely not one of them."
5,Boss never dissapoints,"I bought this pedal today, and I can't believe how amazing it sounds. This is my fifth Boss pedal, and it's also now my favorite. I only had the dials on it at about halfway and it was loaded with distortion. This pedal is great, as are most pedals by Boss. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Well worth it,"Typical BOSS quality and construction. Do yourself a favor and get a quality cable or you'll miss the range of tones this thing delivers. IF you're looking for 'crunch', this is a great choice, and it has myriad adjustments to get the sound just right. Highly recommended. Only went 4 stars because it does eat batteries and I haven't gotten an adapter yet. Neverthless, very satisfying."
4,Still the best.,"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."
2,"I find this book hard to follow and the text, ""choppy.""","The subject matter of this book is something that is of tremendous use in an elementary classroom. However, the text is choppy, and the subject hard to follow from one idea to the next. Even the illustrations fail to provide a common thread woven throughout the book. The collage style pictures are beautiful to look at, but confusing to tie together, especially when paired with the choppy text."
2,I don't get it...,"I bought this book as a companion for a lesson on writing development from a writing program that I love and use. I set up for the lesson then read this book to my students. It was a drag...It was boring...It was disjointed...we didn't get it. It seemed to lack a point. The new title could be ""No Really...Nothing ever happens on 90th Street...I Mean It!"" Now the illustrations were great! I love the loose style of the artist. I wish the author had developed the story better. I wished this teacher had previewed the book better."
5,great songwriter and vocalist,I bought this CD after hearing Suzanne in concert and found the CD to be even better than the live performance.The songs are touching and the music takes you to Suzanne's places of the heart. No wonder she won Singer/Songwriter New Talent of the year at the Kerrville festival!
2,The don't make them like this anymore.,"Im not going to call this thing great or anything like that, I got it at a truckstop for less than $5 and my friends and I took turns beating our heads against the glass for a 5 hour car ride trying to play this game.. Its really hard, especially while going down the road in a car (having a sadistic driver did not help). The graphics are poor but adequate for the game. the system is robust, more than one of use tried to rip it in half. Its far to hard to keep the interest of a youngster and requires the fineness of a brain surgeon to play. I recommend it for anyone who really wants to be frustrated for a long period of time, next time I personally will buy a deck of cards."
3,"Not so quick, not so easy, but adorable","I am an experienced knitter and have knitted many Debbie Bliss patterns. I now have a daughter and have been knitting a variety of things for her. Although the sweaters in the book are adorable, I have several criticisms about this book:(1) it is NOT a book for beginners, as many of the patterns use fairly difficult techniques, which I was surprised at, with no real explanation about them (I had to look some of them up in my Vogue Knitting reference book); (2) there are no pictures of what the garment looks like - the photos are all nice and adorable, but if you can't see the finished shape the directions can be confusing - I had to re-knit parts of the sweater featured on the cover because I couldn't see how it all fit together. The patterns are cute and adorable once finished, but they do take some time and patience to complete."
2,Technically lacking,"While this book has many very cute designs for children, there are some very aggravating aspects as well: the way the directions are presented, the lack of clear pictures or diagrams of the designs, and cryptic explanations of some techniques. The baby slippers pattern does not even include the gauge or finished measurements. It was very disappointing to read through the book, because there are cute designs that I would like to make, however, I know in advance that the knitting and garment construction is going to be confusing and painful. A little extra effort in putting this book together would have made it a joy to use."
3,A sloppy book by a good designer,"I couldn't wait to buy this book, having been entranced by Debbie Bliss's designs in Wild Knitting when she was Debbie Hudson. I also enjoyed several of her earlier children's books, such as Nautical Knits for Kids and Great Kids for Kids. In comparison to the earlier books, I found this book to be sloppily put together and laid out. There are no diagrams with measurements, as are provided in her earlier books. Toward the book's end, there is one totally wasted page with a picture of knitting--not even of several garments spread out attractively, so that the whole items may be seen. I also felt that some designs, such as the animal slippers, would have been attractive in a less bulky weight yarn. Perhaps there was a rush to produce this book, and its quality suffered. I hope this trend does not continue, as Debbie Bliss is a very gifted designer."
5,FABULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL...........,DEBBIE BLISS'S KNITTING BOOKS FOR CHILDREN(THIS IS THE ONLY KIND I'VE PURCHASED) SINCE I BECAME A GRANDMA 5 1/2 MOS AGO. I HAVE SEVERAL OF HER BOOKS AND HER SWEATERS ARE SO UNIQUE-WHICH THRILLS ME!! I'VE EXPERIMENTED WITH OTHER YARNS THAN HER'S AND I'VE HAD NO PROBLEM(ALWAYS CHECK YOUR GAUGE)! ENJOY!!
3,DISAPPOINTING,"THE CHILDREN ARE BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE ITEMS THEY ARE MODELING ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE BECAUSE THE CAMERA GOT TOO CLOSE. ANYTHING THAT DEBBIE BLISS DOES DESIGN IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK IS A TEASE."
2,Not for everyone,I have very sensitive and oily skin and this brands bar soap is the only one I use/can but don't daily in any acne areas because of it's moisture. This liquid form has a little fragrance as well that doesn't work for me.
1,Amazon does not stand behind what they sell!,"When I ordered the Gable Ventilators, the web site listed the item as ""a pack of six."" I ordered two boxes of six ventilators (12 vents total). I received 2 vents. My emails to Amazon have gone unanswered for the last month. I keep emailing them and keep emailing them, but they do not answer. Now I have been ripped off by Amazon and Amazon could care less. I learned my lesson with Amazon, I hope you don't have to learn the same way I did."
4,Works great and nice capacity,Large griddle is perfect for my family. Just wish it heated more evenly but we're generally happy with it. Shipped quickly and was easy to assemble.
2,Even heat but NOT durable,"I bought this to replace an older griddle whose nonstick surface was coming off. It provides an even heat, although it's not very ""strong"". Put a cold food item on there and it cools down almost instantly. A handle has also broken from normal handling... so hard to find a good, well made counter top griddle."
4,Really nice effect pedal,"I have been playing for more than 30 years. I play through an Egnater Rebel 30 and a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe. Although both of these amps sound great on their own, this pedal adds yet another dimension. I gave up playing in clubs years ago and now I play primarily for my enjoyment and I write and record my original tunes in my home studio. Whether I am using an axe with single coils or hum buckers, this pedal shines. I have always felt Boss makes the best pedals and I have many Boss products. I also have some EH, Dunlop and MXR pedals. I used a Tube Screamer for a short while and never understood the hype it gets. This pedal blows the Ibanez out of the studio and off the stage. Don't know how it would work with a solid state amp but with a tube amp I'm confident that it will earn your respect."
5,Awesome!,"These eggs are great- they have a snappy sound, and the size is perfect!My 10 month old loves them - it's the perfect distraction when he's getting his diaper changed and needs to stay still and occupied!"
4,A wonderful representation of Alma-Tadema and his work,"_Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema_ is very well-organized, and Russell Ash provides informative insight into Alma-Tadema's life and the substance of his paintings. Each plate is accompanied by an informative vignette which further enhances the effect of each beautiful piece. The sample of art as a whole is well-chosen and certainly representative of Alma-Tadema's body of work, but one would like to see more paintings included. Altogether, a wonderful value."
3,Eye Candy,"These are gorgeous reproductions of some of the most technically adept and intellectually hollow art imaginable. You can't help but admire Alma-Tadema's virtuosity, even as you wonder why on earth he went to all the trouble. Maybe, like that other popular artist British knight, Sir Elton John, Sir Lawrence knew what struck the public's fancy, and was content to make a lot of money by devoting his considerable talents and energy to providing it."
2,Bright but not sticky...,"These self-adhesive bright white LED lights are certainly bright and lit up my closet under the stairs quite well. My problem was that they didn't stay ""stuck"" on the walls and would constantly fall off, getting lost in the clutter of items that I needed them to illuminate in the 1st place..."
2,"Great at first, then not so wonderful.","When I got this to put in the closet, I was very pleased: the light was bright, easy to use and it was easy to stick to the wall.However, the brightness does not last! You have to change the batteries every couple of months, even if using alkalines, to get a bright light. The color of the LEDs is a little off, too.So I could only recommend this as an emergency light or somewhere where you won't use it very often.And under no circumstances forget to turn it out and leave it burning overnight!"
5,Very nice,I bought these lights to go under kithen cabinets to illuminate all of my stainless steel appliances on the counter top. They look beautiful in the kitchen especially at night. Great alternative to under cabinet wiring.
2,Very little light,I put three of these in my closet so I could see my clothes better.The light they provided was minimal. I wouldn't recommend these for anything more than a gloves compartment in a car or carryone one around to see a keyhole.
3,NONE,"The product is as pictured. We found the light to be too blue, and too much of a ""spotlight"" effect for our under-shelf purpose, but would probably be good for casual use."
3,"Funny, and different.","This book made me smile pretty often. The author's manga style isn't really my favorite, but that usually doesn't stop me from reading any series. I really thought this book was more about comedy than anything else.You have Nina who is a drop out witch and Ayu who is a normal and really popular girl. Normally those two things don't mix, but the way the mangaka artist makes it work is very good. Nina entrusts Ayu with the secret that she is a witch and that really changes Ayu's life. All Ayu really wanted was the guy she likes to like her back. (poor Ayu!)I thought this story was cute, would I buy it? Probably not, just check it out at a library or read it at a book store. There are five books in all, and I'd say that is pretty reasonable length for the story the author has written. Over all I liked the book/series, didn't love it, but it was a good read."
2,Wowieee!,Wowiee I luv book. I CRY THIS BOOK IS GOOOOOOOD! This book is about a girl Nana who can talk to retarded dogs. AND THEY CAN TALK! She meets a girl named AU
3,Not Yet Incredible,"In my opinion, The Incredible String Band didn't become incredible until Williamson and Heron discovered psychadelia and recorded jems like ""Chinese White"", ""The Eyes of Fate"" and the entire Hangman's Beautiful Daughter LP. Their self-titled debut, in comparasson, is pretty much your garden variety British folk music with little of the imagination and eccentricity of their later work. Clive Palmer contributes one original number and some excellent banjo playing but seems more like a guest musician than a full fledged band member.If early ISB material is what you crave, first check out the superior Chelsea Sessions 1967 CD featuring well-recorded demos of many of the songs that were later re-recorded for the 5000 Spirits LP that same year. Others may disagree, but I consider their debut to be for ISB completists only and not an essential recording."
4,"The National Geographic Society's Publification, 1969.","A fine book with numerous color photographs. Good for modellers. 212 pages carry us year by year through the U.S. civil war. Slavery, battles, politics, leaders, daily life and its expenses, etc. are some of the topics touched upon. The book gives a good outline of the war and should be read by all beginners in this historical field."
2,Feels too much like a vehicle for the author's opinions,"The format of a dialogue between people with opposing views about survival of death gives an impression of objectivity, but in reality, this is essentially a piece of apologetics for self-as-physical-body. The person who doesn't believe in survival of death is constantly winning the discussion over the person who does, and the latter keeps switching views as each idea of his is ""disproven,"" often by a trivial objection.It poses as an introduction to the topic, but the overwhelming impression given--that there is no significant philosophical support for survival of death, and moreover that people who believe in it aren't very bright--makes it a terrible resource for a beginner, and not nearly comprehensive or convincing enough for the persuasive piece it actually is."
1,One star for being short ...,"... but one star is all it gets. It lacks sufficient depth for such an interesting topic and drags needlessly over obvious arguments. Those attracted to teaching superficial philosophy might enjoy it, but if you've thought about the subject already save your time and money. You've read it all before."
2,Readable but hopelessly outdated,"Stoddard's text, culled mainly from early to mid-20th century monographs, is a highly readable and well-illustrated account of some of the major Gothic edifices of France but it should be treated with caution. Most of the scholarship is hopelessly out of date (and much of it already was when he wrote it) and he is too uncritical of the grand theorising of Simson & Panofsky et al. If it is to be used, it should be read in conjunction with Paul Crossley's footnotes to Frankl. I teach French Gothic architecture at undergraduate level and I always advise my students to steer clear of Stoddard. Suitable for a keen amateur but not for art history majors."
5,Good enough for Bagettes,"After many years of using digital cameras, I've finally found one that has consistently impressed me with it's ease of use and myriad of features. It's priced around $400, goes up to 6 megapixels (which is great for casual use) and it has a 3"" glossy display on the back. It easily fits in your pocket, the battery life is great and the memory cards aren't very expensive. If that's not enough, it shoots video as well. I took it on a trip with the kids, and not only were our pictures amazing, but we were all able to use it without having to read the manual. I give it 5 out of 5 Stars."
5,Great Camera for close ups,"This camera is perfect for macro type shots. I use it to take pictures of flowers and parts of flowers. I have found that it is good down to about one millimeter objects. It has its faults though (like the auto focus is sometimes a bit funky), but for the price it is an easy 5 stars.See:[...].This photo is of a very tiny flower sitting on the end of my finger. The flower is less than one mm in length (1/24 of an inch) and yet the image is crisp with lots of detail."
5,clever and funny,"This book is funny but also has some helpful advice and insights, such as don't forget that the baby monitor is on when you go to check on your baby when you have guests - they will be able to hear you! My husband found some of his experiences validated, and we've enjoyed it together when he reads it aloud to me while I'm breastfeeding."
3,Good bathroom read,"It wasn't exactly what I was looking for in a book for dads, but is still funny and has tidbits of good advice. It's a little ""fluffy"" in the way it approaches the subjects (each page has a topic couched in humorous references to Zen that'll make you chuckle), but doesn't expand on anything too much. So, if you're looking for lots of detailed information and theory this sure isn't it, but if you're looking for a good book written in a tone that guys will like that you can just take 5 minutes at a time on, this is great. My wife and I read it on a road trip and I keep it in the bathroom, and that's about the best way to enjoy it, I think."
1,Misinformation,"Admittedly I only scanned this book in the store but frankly, the author lost me when I read:the reason babies are nocturnal is because the night nursing staff has more time to play with baby and therefore they associate night with play.Come on are you serious? Babies are more likely confused because they are rocked to sleep while mom moves around during her day and then when she settles down at night baby no longer lulled by the movement and wakes up to play."
5,Truth Distilled,"Anything worth doing or learning takes effort and time. Such is the case when reading this book. In its pages, Divine truths are taught by higher beings who speak in poetical metaphor. If you read slowly, letting each dialogue sink in, you will find a wealth of new insight and gain a clearer concept of your relationship to the Divine. If you are skeptical of the authenticity of the dialogues, consider the circumstances under which they were transcribed. Consider how three of the four individuals taught by the angels went to their deaths in the concentration camps with a dignity and calm that amazed and inspired those around them. Consider those that were saved by Gitta with the help of the angels. Consider that Gitta refused any royalites from the sale of any of the books. But above all, read the dialogues and consider their message."
2,"Two Books, Really, So Two Reviews","This book is really a 2-for-1. I found one very inspiring, 5 stars, the other a one-star gumbo of New Age cliches. The real-life story of the four people, three of whom sacrifice themselves so their friend, the fourth, and a group of women and children can survive, is incredibly inspiring and moving. I cried for a long time after reading their stories. These four are simply remarkable people in every sense, and the book is well worth reading in order to learn the story of their lives. The angels' conversation with the four, however, was a letdown. Just New Age cliches, it seemed to me, not very specific or meaningful. The meaning in this book is to be found in the human lives, and the choices these remarkable people made."
5,TALKING WITH ANGELS,"TALKING WITH ANGELS IS A MAGNIFICENT REAL STORY ABOUT ANGELS COMING TO TALK TO A GROUP OF YOUNG ARTIST IN BUDAPEST, IN 1943, IN THE HIGHT OF WORLD WAR II. THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THEY WERE ALIVE AND WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THEIR LIVES. THE ANGELS CAME FOR 18 MONTHS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND GAVE THEM ANSWERS. 3 OR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE JEWISH AND PERISHED IN AUSCHWITZ. THE SURVIVOR GITTA MALLASZ CAME OUT OF THE COMMUNIST RUSSIA IN 1960 AND PUBLISHED THE BOOK IN 1976... IT IS VERY CLOSE TO ME, BECAUSE I AM JEWISH AND I WAS PULLED TO GO TO VISIT HUNGARY IN 2003 FOR 4 MONTHS, I DROVE AROUND THE COUNTRY. COMING BACK TO THE STATE IN 2006 AFTER TRAVELING FOR 6 YEARS IN EUROPE, I READ THE BOOK IN FRENCH AND WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW THIS BOOK WAS CONNECTED TO MY BOOK ""ALLOWMAN"" THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY ANGELS TOO. WHICH I NEED TO PUBLISHED, BECAUSE OF ITS ORIGIN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HOW I RECEIVED IT."
5,TALKING WITH ANGELS,"An amazing story. If you are interested in the metaphysical, in angels, in faith, read this. Quite beautiful."
4,Sweet book!!!,"This book was a very interesting book in many ways. From the comedy of he book to the drama in the book it was an all around good book. Ir really cought my interesy and it pulled me in with an interestng plot. Although here was a lot of swearing in the book, it was still injoyable. The swearing also made the characters who they are and I loved the book. I highly reccomend this book to people around my age because it is bry understandable and easy while it still was on a High School Level."
3,"""between a rock and a hard place"" should i read it",do you like adventure books. If you do you will love this book. In this book Mark Severon and Randy are going on a canoing and camping trip. As they begin something terrible happens. If you want to find out you will have to read the book. On a scale of1-5 i would give this book a 3.
5,book,I recieved this book in a timely manner. It was just as it was descibed on the website. I was very happy with the purchase and the process. I would highly recommend this vendor.
2,Misleading title...,"Very misleading in terms of poetry. I thought that the book would be a better connection between science and literature, but it is very much an informational text...no creative construction of weather at all. The title states ""How 600 proverbs, sayings, and poems accurately explain our weather,"" but the overwhelming majority of this book is presented as any textbook...pages and pages of information with little to no break in terms of poetry or proverbs. And, the little poetry that is in the book, does not read as poetry at all. It is very disjointed and artificial...like something my 4 year old might say."
5,Great Book,"This was a great CT book. The CT images are real images, the cross sectional anatomy was excellent and they had GREAT pathology images in there. I wish there were a little more explanations of the symptoms, but they did a great job covered a vast majority of the pathology i see and ones ive never heard of!"
3,Do yourself another favor,This title has poor sound quality and was not remastered.Cymande - Renegades of Funk was nicely remastered and has 2 unreleased bonus tracks not availble here. I recently bought that record. And the hit track Bra absolutely bumps. The rest of the album flows very nicely. Just thought I would pass along the word to Cymande fans.
3,get the next size,"i bought this for my husband who normally wears a Large in everything. the hooded sweatshirt was too small. he needed the xl. the t-shirt was fine thought. also, the sweatshirt was very thin."
4,Some much needed boost,"I got this product because I felt my baby needed an extra push to get her to a sitting position, she showed immediate interest and sat up in the stroller within minutes! I hang on the bar some colorful games for her to play with so mummy gets extra smiles!"
3,An ultimately unsatisfying read,"The 'prehistory' of sex is certainly a compelling subject, and one I was eager to learn more about, having just read a fascinating book on the same subject. But I was disappointed in this book both because it did not describe clearly enough the various stages in human evolution and because I felt that I actually learned little about the 'prehistory' of sex. I did, however, find a great deal of interesting information in the book, but so much of it was written from detached perspective that it lacked the immediacy and relevancy necessary for modern readers to connect with the topic. After reading it, I found myself wondering what the title actually meant, as the book theorizes about sexual practices and gender divisions throughout human evolution; isn't it more of a history, then, than a prehistory? And what would 'prehistory' mean? I finished the book without really understanding the author's primary goal or message."
3,"a bit agumentative, but good.","This book is quite argumentative in nature. It seems to take few stands except on some of histories most interesting subjects. It is interesting, well written, and well researched but it offers little in the way of original informatiion.It covers a lot of information in history that I have not read elsewhere but it is not really original in nature. The information has to be written more argumenative than correctly. It is mostly the author's opinion of what is covered than facts about what is covered. It is also somewhat confusing in nature. Not one of the best entries at all."
5,The human spirit comes alive in NYSTY!,"This movie is worth 90 minutes of your time. It chronicles a group of New York City firemen and others helping the towns and citizens get back on their feet in the small towns of Texas, Indiana,Kansas and Iowa.To the firemen from New York it's a bit of a culture shock from the tall buildings and bright lights that they are accustomed to. The main reason of why they are in these places is a way to say ""Thanks"" after all of America rallied after the tragedy ten years ago at the World Trade Center.This is a movie that will make you proud as an American and give you the power to volunteer in making your community a better place. Kudos to Jeff Parness for what he has done and for this movie. This would make a great gift for someone!"
4,Read this book as a child - was thrilled to find it again,"I used to read this when I visited my grandparents. I was tickled to find it. It did not arrive looking like the photo the vendor provided. It had no book jacket (and the photo did). It was an old library book, in the shape I expected for a used book. I was glad to be able to read it again."
5,A book to pass down through the generations,"My mom got this book when I was a young girl in the 80's and she, my sister, and I all read it. It is beautiful. Somehow through the years our copy disappeared. We loved it so much that I knew I had to come to Amazon to find a copy to give my mom for Mother's Day. She was thrilled and so was I. It is a beautiful story and one not to be missed. She ended up giving it back to me to pass down to my three daughters to read. If you have a chance to get this book DO NOT hesitate. You won't be sorry."
4,class of '70,"I have rated this cd on the sound quality...a little brassy e.g., more highs than lows; but better than the 4 and 8 tracks of yesteryear! I rate the CD 5 stars with regard to songtitles. The selections are just as I remember them; great memories!"
1,Waste of money,"Oxo usually designs their products so thoughtfully, I was willing to pay a little extra for this baster. For $10, I expected this to be a high-quality product, but it was a total disappointment. First, the hole at the tip is so large, the liquid runs out without even sqeezing the bulb. Then the plastic peice that cradles the bulb kept falling down into the pan juices. I'm not even sure what function it serves. It's mediocre at best, and everyone would be wise to buy something else."
1,Horrible!,"I thought I would buy a more expensive baster than your typical ""dollar store"" basters, in hopes that it would work better. This baster is horrible! The top piece kept popping off the ""tube"". I was trying to baste my turkey Thanksgiving morning when this happened and needless to say, I had a mess all over my oven and also burned myself with the hot juices when this thing decided to let go."
1,Save your money!,"The OXO Good Grips Baster is poorly designed and likely subject to wide manufacturing standards. Mine disassembled and assembled easily when following the instructions (to ease in cleaning), but the bulb does not fit snugly enough to prevent air from entering the top of the unit. Even with the collar snapped into place air leaked in and allowed liquid to drip out. (The size of the hole is normal and is not the problem as reported by another reviewer.) Loose manufacturing tolerances probably allows for some to come through without significant air leakage. Do you feel lucky?I replaced it with a $1.69 supermarket baster which works great. Exceptfor its cleaning brush I threw the OXO out."
5,Great Product,I used this to change out some of my power steering fluid. It worked really great and im sure its just as good with turkeys!!
1,Oxo Good Grips Turkey Baster,"Do not buy this baster, it is a piece of junk, very poorly designed!! The bulb comes off as you try to use it. I bought it thinking Oxo always designs quality kitchen tools. We do have other Oxo Good Grip tools that are very nicely designed."
1,3 peices no good,"We bought this as an emergency Thanksgiving baster and was very disapointed when it came apart and failed to ""suck"". As with other comments, the hole is large and it doesnt keep anything in. All the fluid runs out or shoots out leaving a very frustrated cook. The bulb attaches well but the ring does not. One suck and its laying in the oven. Not worth the $9.99/$10."
5,Good Grips,I bought this for a Christmas present. The recipient loved it. She uses it a lot. It was worth the purchase.
3,I don't recommend this DVD,"I hate to give a negative recommendation, but I don't think I can restrain myself from doing so with this product. Both Alfonzo and Aliza certainly have the technical abilities, but Alfonzo's style leaves much to be desired. What's with his left hand's movement? The men's shines are very cliche and stuck in 1990's interpretation of LA style salsa more appropriate for a ballroom show than for social dancing. The turns are equally dissapointing.Regarding Aliza, that's another story. She certainly has the moves, and her teaching is far more useful (for ladies that is) and pleasant to the eye. I would recommend this DVD for beginners and intermediate LADIES so that they can take advantage of Aliza's teaching. That's why I give it 3 starts.There are far better on-1 salsa productions out there (Salsa Brava when it comes to LA style or Cultural Explosion for NY style.)"
2,Not for the faint of heart,"Certainly a summary, as advertised ... and for a senior who wants to revisit biology it's fine. However, the illustrations are not necessarily close to the descriptions, sometimes the text reads like bad translation (from ??), and each chapter badly needs an overview."
1,Nothing explained simply,You will gain little more knowledge from this book than your professors lecture. Everything is explained dry and swift. Try the homework helper books the creators seem to understand that students and not doctors are the readers...
2,Run The Other Way!,"I've written a couple of very negative reviews of the Zinman Beethoven cycle and I felt a stab of regret thinking, ""Who am I to blast these recordings? I'm not an expert and I've only been seriously listening to Beethoven's music for a short time."" But you know, in that short time I've listened to alot of music, in alot of different ways and I believe I can perceive that this music is not being presented with the amount of subtext that must be included: ""Is this piece or part of a piece about ""passion""...or ""joy""...or ""pathos"" ""? In Zinnman's Beethoven it is just a list of notes to be sounded. Conductors have styled this work in different ways, but always emphatically. The ninth is not a walk in the park, not chamber music, and not boring."
5,It's About Time!!,"After reading just a few chapters of this thought-provoking and emotionally charged book, I mused to myself: ""...it's about time that someone captured their experience in such a fashion that the average person could understand and relate to their message.""Thomas Walker's book reinforces the message that a diagnosis of cancer is devastating news; yet,with adjustments in mental attitudes and the support of loved ones, it is a challenge that can be understood and overcome.Walker also maintains a delicate balance between medical and layman's language, which is a definite plus. This is even more meaningful because it is coming from a person who has ""been there...""Kudos to Walker for his courage, his commitment and his stamina in completing his project. I definitely look forward to reading a sequel to this amazing story, and I hope that one is in the works. It is definitely a ""must-read."""
3,Studio versions of many of Martin's best songs,"This has studio versions of many of Martin's best songs. None of these are his best versions, since his best versions are always live, but they are good. Several were re-makes from early albums (Glory Bound, Way I Am), which help complete the quality of the album. I prefer the original versions of the songs, but they are still good here. I have never heard a live version of ""The American"", but the song is excellent here. If you are a Martin Sexton fan, this is a good album to fill out the collection."
4,Not The Same But Worth It,"Martin Sexton makes me stop what I'm doing and just listen to his voice, usually with my eyes closed to get the full effect. He's amazing. But I was a little taken aback to hear how ""produced"" this new album is. Still, I found myself listening with my eyes closed -- so that's a good sign."
3,Money - still the root of all evil,"Has Martin sold out here or what? Was it really necessary to re-do such great songs as Glory Bound, Candy and others just to appease the money hungry producer that he now works for. The music world doesn't need any more top 40 hits but it seems that Atlantic trying to produce just that. I am greatly disappointed with this release and in fact, was disappointed with the last concert I saw. I have seen Martin at least six times but unfortunately, it appears he is losing his innocence. And, subsequently the raw edge that made him so great. Please come back, Martin."
2,Disappointed,"My friend had put the older version of ""Glory Bound"" on a mix she gave me. I fell in love with the song and was excited to find a new musician. I went and bought ""The American."" I found none of the same raw, sparse guitar and vocals that I loved in ""Glory Bound."" There are some good moments in the album, but there are too many catchy or hokey parts of it. In the title track there are back-up country singers. Every song begins with promise and then is ruined by some element of overproduction. Next time, Sexton, get better production advice!"
3,should have been better,"I love love love Martin Sexton's music, but after one listen it is clear to me that 'The American' does not show off his talents well. The emotional depth and spontaneity of his performances must have been lost somewhere during rehearsal and production, leaving a catchy album with some decent songwriting, but nothing more. ""Diggin Me"" seemed jarringly out of place; it might be a good song in another context, but I hated it here! The best songs are available in far superior versions on his other albums anyway, so unless you are a die-hard fan, skip this and buy 'Live Wide Open' or 'Black Sheep.'"
2,"""The American"" pales in comparison to ""Black Sheep""","When Ravel rearranged Mussorgsky's piano piece ""Scenes from an Exhibition"" for full orchestra, it came alive in full 3-D color. When Martin Sexton rerecorded his signature song ""Glory Bound"", which was a perfect symbiosis of voice and guitar in its original form, into a quasi-rock song for a studio band, the result was a diffuse watered-down disappointment with no grip (similar to, but not quite as bad as Don McLean's live ""American Pie"" with the Tonight Show Orchestra). Like many others, I heard the first ""Glory Bound"" on public radio and almost instantly regarded it as one of my favorite folk ballads of all time. When I bought ""Black Sheep"" I became hugely impressed with Sexton's vocal agility, much moreso than his songwriting ability. I've heard that he is amazing in concert, but ""The American"" shows an innate lack of musicianship as well as a disconnection between Sexton and his own songs."
5,"spare the producer, martin sexton is still god","To those of you who think that this album is overproduced and that you can't make out Martin Sexton's voice, I have to ask: are you kidding? This is insane. There is no way to disguise one of the greatest voices in the world. I wish that I was a singer so that I could quit singing after hearing him. As for comparison with live performance, not everyone has the time or inclination to rush out to concerts. Hell, I don't even like live music most of the time. This is a milestone recording from one of the most underrated talents in any medium. And no mere music producer can do damage to that."
5,Wisk,"This wisk is perfect, for those tall cups of coffee or tea latte. It's narrow, so youcan actually stir it in the cup and it's long enough to be able to hold the handle. Ilove it."
4,Adios OV7,"Para ser su ultimo disco estuvo muy bien por que nunca antes se habian recopilado todas sus mejores canciones. Tambien me gusto el hecho que nada mas dejaron los exitos de cuando ya eran grandes por que hubiera destruido el disco con canciones infantiles. Por ultimo, no esperes versiones nuevas de canciones viejas, especialmente, cuando se esta rompiendo el grupo. Me gusta el repertorio de canciones y espero ver otro grupo como OV7 pronto!"
1,Two thumbs down.,"Total Disappointment.To be their last CD. Is just bad, It does not even include new versions of the songs, except for three. They did not include any of the songs from their first CD.The only good song is ""No me Voy""."
5,Impossible genius,"This album has just about everything discerning lovers of indie guitar music could ever wish for - beauty, passion, complexity, originality, even humour - it's so good it makes me laugh. Every listen unearths different treasures as the songs effortlessly glide from complex angular dischordancy to the perfect pop hook. The guitars are so truly inventive they have to be heard to be believed, whilst the vocals are pure and heart-wrenching. An essential purchase therefore, pop-pickers!"
5,Its GRRRRRRREEEEEAAAAAATTTTT,"I love this toy so much!My daughter loves it even more!its greater than the tiger on the cereal box!!!! Itsso ""cool"" as the kids would say"
3,good idea but poorly executed,"On the surface, this is a great idea. You put in a CD, the music plays and words come up to the songs in real time on a small black and white TV screen. The words are highlighted so you can sing along. You can also hook it up to your TV and have the words and music come through the TV.But, there are only 4 songs per CD. To build up any kind of library, you have to buy lots of CD's. And the selection is not that good.When you put in a CD, it takes the machine over a minute to recognize the CD and the format. So, flipping from CD to CD takes a while.Because there are only 4 songs on a CD, and the time it takes to switch CD's, you end up singing one or two songs over and over again. You quickly get bored of the system."
5,One of the best gifes I have got for crismass,"When I first came down on christmas mornig I was releaved to see the karaoke system. I was suprised that it only took me about five minutes to get it out of the box and start singing.It came with a sample cd with three songs(you have to go buy the other cds).It comes with a tv screen that puts the words up to the song.you can also play regular cds on it.It is so easy to use that all I have to do is plug it in and press play and start singing.you also can record your singing on to a tape.It also has buttons that can make your voice eco.You can plug it into the tv and have the words come up, but i think you can see all the words fine on theMTV screen.I LOVE IT SO MUCH ALL AGES WILL LOVE IT."
5,Can't think of better gift,"With 3 daughters that all love music, I can't think of a better Christmas gift. I'm sure any family (musical or not) would have hours and hours of fun after the kids opened this one up. Though this one is a little costly, it's well worth it to have the extra features and quality."
2,Buy the other one!,Buy the one that goes through your TV. This is a waste of time. Sure you can move it from room to room. Yet the kids and adults are always were the TV is! We had it for a year and we just did not use it. We used our Comcast on demand karaoke which is free and it runs through our stereo. Good Luck
4,Best Gift I Ever Got,"The reason I gave it 4 stars was there are so many fun thingd you could do to your voice and it plays any kind of cd's. Also it has a tv so you could watch tv and a tape player. The only thing which I didn't like was you have to buy certain cd's for the lyrics to come on the screen. I only give it one star for educational because, c'mon it's a karaoke machine. How much could you learn? I gave it 5 stars for durability because it can stand being in my room which would say a lot if you saw it, even though I only had it for 3 days. But still I would recomend it to anyone!"
1,Beware,Bought for my daughter for Christmas. Worked great then the TV completely quit working. [...] Quite simply don't buy this product!
3,A Nice Story,"It was a nice story, but I don't really like nice stories. I need a little more oomph to my books. But, a quick read nonetheless, and it meant alot to the friend that recommended it, so I enjoyed it on her behalf."
1,Overrated sap,"Have we bought into the consumer culture so deeply and removed ourselves so far from an awareness of self and others that a novel that reads like an extended high school composition--dressing up common sense as some sort of homespun wisdom--is able to touch us so profoundly? Contrived, predictable, sentimental, and poorly written (good writing suggests, it doesn't bludgeon), Tending Roses never once surprises, and with its stock characters, wooden dialogue, and lame family anecdotes that the Vongortler clan inexplicably find so humorous, it rings false from page two (starts with an enticing first paragraph) to end. For agrarian fiction that truly resonates, may I suggest Wendell Berry's The Memory of Old Jack, A Place on Earth, or Jayber Crow--fiction to be read slowly and savored."
1,Couldn't buy into it,"Maybe I should have stuck with this book, but I just couldn't make myself. It seemed syrupy and maudlin at the same time. Not for me."
5,"Taking time to ""tend the roses""","This book is one of my all time favorites. I have read it twice now and treasure the book. It has so many pearls of wisdom and my copy is underlined throughout. I loaned it to my mother who put little stars on the pages in the parts that touched her heart. It was interesting to see her marks and to feel that I had the same opportunity that the character ""Kate"" has in the book with her grandmother. I have stopped loaning my copy to people as I was afraid I would lose it and and the notes and markings throughout. I have recommended the book to many people and have used it twice in two different book clubs. Read it with a marker and with a box of tissues. It will touch your heart!!!"
5,Best Book I ever read !!!!,"I just finished reading this extraordinary book----I am now planning to purchase a copy for each of my sisters, nieces, daughter-in-law, and my mom. Reading the book makes you realize what matters in this journey of life we are all on...it was so well written and touched on every emotion--and when I read the last page I had tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. A MUST READ !!!!"
5,Beautiful Gift!,"Tending Roses is, without doubt, one of the best gifts I have ever received, and the BEST book I have EVER read. It was given to me by a dear friend who said that she just knew the book was for me, though she wasn't sure why. When I read it, I realized that Grandma Rose in the book is so much like my own Nanna Gale, and that is why the book was meant for me. Nanna Gale died when I was still too young to care about all of her old stories and the wise things she tried to tell us, and only years later did I wish I would have listened more. Reading Tending Roses was like a chance to go back and talk to Nanna Gale again.Since reading the book, I have shared my copy with many friends, and so far every one of them has gone out and bought copies for themselves, and often copies to give as gifts. As one of the other reviewers said, ""It is that good!"" This book is pure magic. Bravo!"
5,wonderful and tender very real,I bought this book as bedtime reading. Little did I know I would be captivated by the family written about in the book. I wanted to see the relationship of each member and how the book ended. I loved the book and it was a very quick read. I only wish there were more like this story.
4,Thank you Grandma Rose,"What drew me to this story was the fact that my Mom is a Nana Rose, and what was amazing to me was I could picture the lessons that ""Grandma"" Rose was trying to teach her grand daughter coming from my mother to my daughter some day in the future. We take so much of life for granted, and when it's coming to an end, we often look back to see all the things we could/should have done differently. For the beauty and simplicity of the stories by Grandma alone, this book is worth the read, if you have an elderly grandparent, like I do, it is a nice reminder that they were once young & full of life, and that the important things they NEVER forget. A truly touching story.Enjoy :)"
3,"Sweet, Sentimental, and Sappy","I can't say I disliked this book. It contains a positive, uplifting message and a feel-good ending. However, serious literature it is not. The storyline revolves around a granddaughter who is changed by spending several weeks with her aging grandmother on the family farm. The characters are definitely likable, but a bit shallow. The ending is so predictable I knew it from page 10. If you want a nice, pleasant, easy story that won't try your brain, this is it. If you're a fan of quality contemporary fiction, you may want to skip this."
5,Moving and inspirational,"I finished this book in one sitting. I was moved to tears at times and could almost hear the voices of my own family and my own past as I read the story of Kate and her family. This book was in my hands at exactly the time when I needed a reminder of what is important in life--a little like Grandma Rose's book appearing to Kate at the precise moments. This story made me want to drive to the fictitious farm and meet Grandma myself. It made me wish I had known my own deceased grandmothers more. It made me want to put the book aside and call everyone who ever meant something to me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story, real characters, beautiful writing and a little inspiration for their own life. Kudos to Lisa Wingate for such a wonderful and moving novel."
4,I loved the messages from the grandmother,"I thought this was going to be too predictable and too sweet a novel, but it surprised me. The inspirational sayings that she gets from her grandmother as she struggles in her life are what make this book more than just any other story. It really is worth the read,"
5,Elegant and Gritty at the same time,"The Hunger Bone is a wonderful collection of short stories strung together with shorter stories, prose poems, to give the collection texture and contribute to the creation of a world -- the world of travelling rock and roll musicians. The characters are beautifully drawn, and the stories reveal the thrills and trials of such a life. There's lots of humor here, and cynical glimpses of the audience's behavior on a dance floor when energy is high and inhibitions are low. We see the economic struggles of the musicians, their loyalties to each other, and points when those loyalties break down. The details are clear and ring true, and the tales are moving. Any lover of rock and roll would love this book. It's great. The elegant prose is so beautiful -- musical, in fact."
1,"THIS ""WRITER"" WILL NEVER MAKE ANY MONEY","Another collection of actionless short stories by yet another tenured academic ""writer."" When will these academic authors learn that in order to make money as writers they must first tell intelligent, meaningful, gripping, action-packed stories? Don't look for a novel from Miss Marquart--she hasn't got the range. Something needs to happen in a story--an abortion, a fight, an accident--SOMETHING. Nothing happens here; the musicians go from town to town. Even more distressing is the author's obvious complexes and hatreds relating to men. Pass this one by!"
5,AMAZING CD,"AMAZING BEATS, AMAZING LYRICS, AMAZING THEMES, BEST CD OF ALL YEAR, IF U LIKE HARDCORE RAP , GET THIS TODAY"
5,Irwin has a winner.,Irwin has written a great book. It's easy to read and understand and the examples Irwin provides make you feel as if you're looking over his shoulder during the transaction. Would recommend to anyone that's interested in real estate.
3,"Not the best, but ...","Although I don't consider this book as one of the best Harlequin Superromance, I still enjoy reading it. It offers a different insight and style from toher romance novel I've ever read.The plot is focused on the team of Carson (local ranger) and Alisha Jamison (wildlife photographer) to search for poachers. But their mission is not easy, and the danger behind the thick tress and deep water in Everglades can tear them apart.If you like reading romance with the touch of tribal culture and wildlife, this should be on your list :)"
5,Little Book of Wisdom,"I loved this book! Virginia Morris Briggs weaves a wonderful story filled with all the insight and wisdom of The Prophet. I flew alongside Robin Ray in her search, and I felt a calm peacefulness when the answers to her questions were realized. This is a book I will enjoy reading again and again. It will be on my list of gifts. I'd like to share it with everyone I know and love."
3,Not As Spiritual as Past Albums,"I love the Raincoats for their ability to completely recreate themselves with each album. The first was punk, the third reggae, and the second somewhere in between. This album also is something totally different. As always they are willing to experiment with unusual sounds, instruments, and rhythms. This album, however, is the least favorite. It lacks the spirituality of _Odyshape_ and _Moving_, two albums where the music itself is a spiritual event. In _Looking in the Shadows_, it seems the stories they're trying to tell through the lyrics take precedence over song composition. The music merely provides background for the vocals, it doesn't reach out to envelop the listener like in previous works. The whole tone of the album is more cynical and harsh in sound and words- not something typical of the Raincoats.Overall, this album doesn't have a tenth of the emotional power of the past releases."
3,2 good songs,"Let me get straight to the point. All the songs except for 2 are pretty weak, and you most likely will never listen to them. The reason to buy this single would be for Born Slippy and Dark Train. That is the reason I gave it 3 stars. But Born Slippy and Dark Train are incredible songs. So the question is, would you be willing to get this CD for only 2 songs? Unless you have an mp3 player hooked up to your stereo sytem, then I'd say go for it and spend the money."
5,God Certainly Does Care for Us!,"This book is such an encouragement to trust and continue in the care of the Lord, no matter what is going on in your life or what is present in your thoughts. The chapters bring out the fact that God loves every one of us in a deep, special way and wants us to see this in our every day lives. The book has certainly brought me to a deeper trust in the Lord concerning issues that I have been praying about for years."
5,3+3= DOUBLE UP GREAT!!,"My, my, the lives of the Isley Brothers is special, because the three older brothers were great by themselves, then comes the younger brothers, Ernie, Marvin and cousin in law Chris Jasper on board!! and the Isleys become supergreat!!.A masterful vocal and instrumental supergroup!.It's evident all over this classic album,the mega hits,""that lady"" and ""summer breeze"" perfect pieces right out!!.Other solid cuts are ""don't let me be lonely tonight"" and ""the highways of my life"". Give an ear to ""if you were there"",""you walk your way"" and ""sunshine"",and you will agree that this album is an absolute essential in any music stock, it can fit with any group!!!.A major turning point in the right direction for the Isleys!!. I proudly recomend this piece to all Isley fans, and fans of great music in the real sense, satisfaction is rapped up in this one!!."
5,3 + 3,"This CD is a must have in your collection when R&B was kicking butt. This was played at all the parties, dances, and events of the 70's back in the day.If you didn't have this album it wasn't considered a party."
5,excellent starting point!,"I have just recently delved into the musically rich genres of R&B/soul,and already count the Isley Brothers as one of the best! This album in particular is a great place to get your feet wet, as it has an excellent rock-based foundation with the strong guitar playing and arrangements.I imagine a large part of their success back in the day was due to this crossover appeal (besides them being excellent songwriters/performers).The covers on this album are really great, totally making the songs their own (which is the point in covering a song in the first place,right??).An excellent starting point!"
2,defects,"I had a sony clie and a Palm a while back and both didn't last me very long. The Palm lasted me only one year before the screen went totally black. The sony clie lasted me two years before it had a total melt down.Provided that I do had a tendance to wham a stylus down on the touch screen really hard... well what can I say, I'm a strong women. I don't know my strength. So in result of of these two product malfunctioning at an early state, I stopped buy all sony and Palm PDA's. I just hope this apple Itouch can with stand my ""Super"" strength for the next five years. ;) And wont melt down before seven years are up. Beware - Treat your sony clie and Palm like a porceline china."
1,Don't believe a word,"My experience? Aweful!!!! It is a lie that they will provide software to make it work with Outlook. They did this for a few and stopped. Do not buy from Sony folks! I spent 2 weeks over 6 hours on the ""help line"". In the end? Not Sony's problem, have a nice life. I am just trying to help others not have my experience. Don't be fooled by positive reviews, Sony people are the ones writing the good reviews. I am one abused customer and Sony doesn't give a rip.Don't waste your money on Sony."
2,terrible volume,"Great product except that the alarm volume cannot be adjusted above what other PDA manufacturers call medium. Since the alarm is intergral to the DATE BOOK, if the date book is an important function for you, don't get the CLIE"
2,SONY Clie,"I like the Clie, but if something goes wrong it's almost impossible to fix. Amazon doesn't get back to you, there is no-one to speak to, and to send the Clie to Sony will take time. My Clie is brand new and it's frustrating to not be able to resolve this. Perhaps buying directly from a store is the better way, then you can return it directly should there be any problems."
2,Lost all memory!,"My father and I both got this PDA for Christmas last year. After around a month, his lost everything. It was sent to be fixed, but after another month, it lost its memory again! By this time, mine also was losing its files. Both PDAs were sent to be fixed only to still delete memory. The repair man said not to let their batteries run out all the way, but by this time, the life of one charge would only last a day if I was lucky and that was if it hadn't been on. I would try to turn it on the next day and the screen would be blank. Today, I never use it anymore because it simply will not turn on!"
2,NOT FOR NOVICES,"I am new to the PDA world, so when I received this as a Christmas gift last year, I was pretty excited about my new gadget. However, once I got into the meat of trying to use it, I found that it is not a user friendly system when it comes to the HotSync, etc functions. Additionally, as a novice, I'd expected the CDRom to provide more instruction for usage than it did. In fact, there was absolutely NO user instructions enclosed at all. Additionally, I recently lost every iota of data in the thing because there was never any instruction on how to save your information and prevent it from being lost. I wouldn't recommend this unit if you've never used one before."
2,Not for Mac! GRRRRRRRRR!,"The PEG-SJ22 is great itself, but the reason why I put only two stars is because - guess what? - there is no software included for the Macintosh! Personally, I am a Macintosh user and evangelist and believe that Microsoft is an evil software empire, and the fact that I had to go looking for drivers really annoys me. If Sony really wants this product to get the extra three stars, they should include some documentation on how to install the drivers on a Mac, or at least where to find them. And also put the documentation in a more obvious place on their CD."
4,My favorite Clie yet!,"I've owned many PDAs, including four Clies. I've owned the S320, S360 (my previous favorite), the SL10, and now the SJ22. The features that make this unit my favorite are:1. Rechargeable battery. The S320 and S360 had rechargables, but the SL10 used AAA batteries.2. The size. This unit is smaller than any other PDA I've ever owned.3. The screen color and resolution. The high-res color screen makes using this a joy in any lighting conditions.4. The hot-sync cable plugs in at the bottom, as opposed to on the left side (SL10). I no longer have to open the case to sync it.Unlike one of the other reviewers, I did not have any problems syncing this with Outlook. The low price and great list of features make this an easy pick."
4,Love mine!!,"I got this as a Christmas present and it is my first handheld so maybe I'm not as picky... I just love it,though. It has everything this mom needs and I put on some new programs for fun(like the addictive bejeweled game!) Yes, it doesn't sync up with my microsoft works bundle calender, etc., but it took under an hour to put it all into their Desktop program for transfer. I can transfer my mail and web pages to view while I'm waiting for the kids, so for me this is great.My only complaint (which maybe I just haven't found the right program yet) is that I can't play any MP3 files. I downloaded one program and the sound was horrible so I'm going to keep looking, but it might be my speakers (I don't know). I love having pictures of my family on it and I can watch video clips, too. My mom, who goes through these devices like candy, is jealous of mine!It's only been one day, but I just love it!"
4,Great Product for the Cost,I replaced my Palm VIIx witht eh SJ22 and could not be happier. It is very zippy and the screen is the best I have seen for the price. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that I can only go 2 work days between battery charges. But seeing that I charge it up every other night it is not a big deal. If I was traveling I would buy a second charging unit or the car charger.
5,Very satisfied,"I have had one of these for two years and it has been flawless. I use it for managing my life, not for viewing films or pictures. I have no need to receive e-mail or view the web from my PDA."
4,Great PDA lacking some features,I really liked this PDA. It combined funtionality with a great price and a easy to use product. I loved how this was priced so low and it was color and rechargable. But it lacked MP3 capibility. It was a great PDA but I have updated to a Palm Tungsten T.
4,It's nice...,"Pros: very nice 320x320 colour screen, 16mb ram, fits nicely in my pocket =)Cons: no cradle, no documents to go software, battery life is noticeably shorter than the sj-20Comments: This is basically the SJ-33 at a cheaper price. If you are looking for a high-value, reliable colour pda to organize your life, then this ones for you."
2,Hidden costs,"I bought the SJ22 thinking that the simple, good looks and functionality of the PDA would make it as indispensable as my last PDA. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't sync the PDA to my Outlook account. The hidden information indicates that you must purchase third party software to allow Outlook syncing. Then I used the on-line help function to help me use the product appropriately. As soon as I searched for ways to use the alarm, I was prompted to purchase the ""Advanced users guide"" - paying for the PDA and the users guide was obviously not enough.The PDA IS attractive and useful but the hidden costs are so infuriating that it is difficult to recommend this product"
1,It's A Sony Sham!!!!,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. Though the product works ok, none of the documentation mentioned that I needed Intellisync Lite software to sync with Outlook. I already spent a good amount of money on the handheld itself and now they want me to go and spend more just so that the item is useful in the slightest? Ridiculous. Even more ridiculous, some ""qualified"" owners of this handheld receive free Intellisync Lite software, while others are left with an expensive paperweight for their desk until they can scrounge up the money for Intellisync. Sony should be ashamed!!!!"
1,Not worth to buy. It is a piece of trash.,"When the handset is fully discharged, all the data will be lost. Twice I lost all my appointments and meetings information and other important notes. I dumpped it to my trash can."
3,"Good product, bad management","Bought a Clie SJ-22 to replace my venerable Visor Deluxe. I had run out of memory and was tired of looking at a monochrome display. In addition, my wife had just purchased an SJ-30 (which is no longer produced) and the new software made it impossible to sync my device. I primarily use the Palm software to look up medications and for addresses/phone numbers. I was infuriated to find out that the Intellisync Lite software was NOT included in the package and was available for an additional price! Luckily, I was able to use the software from the SJ-30 and sync with Outlook. I will not purchase another Sony product in the future. Good product overall...Management has again made a poor business decision."
3,Nice unit but a few major drawbacks,"I have had my unit for a few years, and I like it in many ways, but it has a bad habit of letting me down:- With the flip top, in my purse, the application/power switches can be depressed and it apparently powers on. This runs down the batteries, and- All memory is lost.I've taken to using the Palm calendar and directory in my laptop and not the PDA... pity..."
4,Good Older PDA,"I have had this PDA for over 4 years now, and I have very little complaints. It is an older PDA, but I mostly use it for contacts, minor notekeeping, calender and date keeping and calculator. Nothing special, but it makes my life easier and it works great for what I need it for. I have lost all my info on more than one occasion because of not charging it. But it comes with great Sync software and everything gets put right back on it with one click of a button, so no big deal. So as long as you have a brain and have a computer to back your info up onto, this will work great for you. And the price is right!"
1,Sony Clie',I'm sorry I bought this product - it does not have the capability to retain your info when the battery runs low - I actually have had to reput my info in every time my battery ran low and I didn't catch it in time - my charger cords does not stay attached to the device properly - it's just a mess - I still have to repurchase another organizer.
1,What a piece of poop!,"This is the absolute WORST McCartney book I've read! And I read like all of them. I am totally in love with McCartney and his music, but I hated this book!It is like so full of lies, it's not even funny. The way he trashes Linda is horrible. He makes her look like some witch or something. And he makes Paul out to be some drug and sex crazed maniac! Truly, the only reason I bought the book is for the pictures, which really is the best reason."
2,"Bias, yet accurate in some aspects",i've read many years from now and in my opinion i consider it a more definite McCartney biography. This one is too bias. The author uses too many interviews with people who had a grudge with McCartney and doesn't balance it out with good reviews. It is still entertaining. You just need to keep in mind that it may not be a completely accurate and balanced portrayal of a legend.
4,Blackbird,"I have only just received this book and as I was away for the weekend haven't had a chance to read it yet, but have glanced through it and it looks very interesting."
4,This book never made me hate McCartney,"I read this book years ago and enjoyed it. I know a lot of people say it puts McCartney in a bad light, but it never changed the high opinion I have of the man. No one is perfect and this book cuts through the public persona to reveal that hey, the guy has flaws like the rest of us. I would love to read the updated version."
2,Not so hot,"This book does try to show the different sides of a complex man, and it is the only one I know that deals heavily with McCartney's Wings years. The interview with Denny Laine is also of interest. Unfortunately, Guiliano is a self-promoting writer whose sketchy narrative is mostly quotations, and what little coherent prose there is of his is borrowed from his own other books. The Beatles are barely covered, and there's too much silly gossip. The author's penchant for passing judgement on any given event is also annoying."
2,Beware fans! This author is trying to brainwash you.,The first part is the same old Beatles info that fans have already read millions of times.The next part focuses on the Wings years which in itself is interesting since less information has been written about this period in Paul's life. However it comes across with a bias since the authors main source is the ex-wife of Denny Laine (the guitarist in Wings).
1,I would've given it half a star,"I did read another book by this particular author and although I found it thoroughly amusing I just thought he wrote it for entertainment. There were obviously not enough people that had said actual good things and it just seems like her rounded up people that really disliked Paul McCartney and I know that everyone isn't angelic but he didn't just bend the halo, I thought it was pretty low the way he basically stripped her of her integrity with a full on attack."
1,In a word. Terrible,The book is based on little fact and a lot hearsay and gossip. If the author had been able to corroberate any of the stories i.e. the attempted murder of McCartney by one of his guitarists makes for interesting reading but it is no more interesting than a book on the grassy knoll shooter of Jim Marrs fame.
1,Consider the sources.,"I read this book last year, so I'm light on specifics. But it was awful, I remember that well. I read it shortly after reading ""Many Years From Now,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. Don't bother with this one. Obviously the only people who would talk to the author had an ax to grind and a very inflated idea of themselves relative to Paul or the other Beatles. The book would have been funny if it weren't so stupid. Paul and Linda can't win for losing. For instance, their modest lifestyle is criticized as being hypocritical, given their vast wealth. But in other instances where they spend money in some noticeable way, they're criticized for flaunting the wealth. To top it all off, Giuliano is a bad writer of wooden prose--or does that cancel out to a ""good"" writer?"
1,garbage,"I was this close to buying this book at Amazon.com until I read all the bad reviews for it so I decided to borrow it from a library instead. Boy, I am now glad I didn't waste my money on this trash. I know that Paul McCartney wasn't as angelic as his image portrayed him when he was a Beatle but the author of this book makes him out to be a drugged out sleaze bag. It's a real shame trees had to die so this book could get printed. The only purpose this book serves is to line the bottom of a birdcage."
4,A different angle,"If you're the kind of fan who thinks it is a sin to write anything negative about Paul McCartney, stay away from this book. Yes, the author is heavily partial towards Denny Laine and suspiciously supportive of Paul's stepsister Ruth. But he does provide some unusual views of Paul's career. One thing that is difficult for some hardcore fans to understand is that everyone has a right to give their side of the story. All I can say is that I really enjoyed reading this book. And somehow I thought I would when I read the negative reviews from the ""Paul-can-do-no-wrong"" supporters who felt offended by it."
3,A little big,They seem to be of good quality but are much larger than the ones they are replacing. These work if there is room in your silverware drawer
4,My god is there no end to the awesomeness,"I stick 'em in corn, corn becomes my b*tch. 'nuff said. It says here that nine more words are required."
5,Corn Holders,Tried the other night and they work great ... Finally get to HOLD onto cob without it slipping ... The wash up easy
4,Sturdy holders,"We live in the Midwest, but don't have corn on the cob all that often. I had those flimsy little yellow plastic holders that were breaking apart. The one time we were having corn, I was very frustrated with them. So I set out on a quest to find better ones. In the off season - you can not find them in the stores, believe me. That brought me to my favorite Amazon shopping place. I ended up buying 4 different kinds of holders to test them all. So I'd better step up our corn consumption. The Oxo brand are pretty sturdy. They are sharp though - beware! If it doesn't go in the dishwasher, I don't want it. These do, but I can't say how long they will last. I got another type I really like. If that purchase pops up for me to review, I will. They fit together, which makes them much easier to store than these."
5,Great to have in your kitchen drawer!,These are the best corn holders I've ever had--and I've thrown away the plastic ones I used to have!
2,Tines are not long enough,"As with all OXO products these Corn holders are well made and feel comfortable in the hand. There is, however, a fatal flaw. The tines are too short and do not hold the corn ear securely. They slip out of the corn very easily and could easily deposit the corn in your lap or splashing down on your plate! This would be a very good product if the tines were just a little longer."
3,Strengths and weaknesses,"As the other reviewers noted, Hodin's book is heavy on personal information regarding the artist but low on color reproductions.Given that, I think this is a good book for somebody who already knows a little about Munch and his work. A better introductory book, in my opinion, is Taschen's Munch, by Ulrich Bischoff. It has less information, as it is shorter (and less expensive), but almost all of the reproductions are in color. I believe color reproductions are critical in getting a feel for any artist's work but that this is particularly the case regarding the work of an artist such as Munch.Hodin's book would seem to be a good follow-up to one such as Taschen's, providing more information on both the artist and his work."
5,how the book was won!,I read it on the internet. good book. my fav. part was when link bought his shield. and also I like when gannan was looking through his crystle ball spying on link. it's a good plot because it focus's on a part of the origanal game.adeo's!
2,Sound quality quite dreadful,"It could be worse, I suppose, but speech sounds muffled/as if coming from underwater, and music quality is unimpressive, especially towards the bass. Radio reception, even with the built-in wire antenna at full stretch, is poor. I suppose I could be missing it, but I could not locate the advertised line-in jack for cd players and other devices.The one plus is the area around the dock is large enough to connect my 30GB 5G iPod without removing it from its case. However, I'll still be returning this item."
4,Convenient measuring cup,"Measures well without the stooping down to check quantity accuracy. But, the design makes it a little difficult to scrape out contents."
2,Easy to read measurments but it Melted.,This plastic measuring cup is easy to read but I have to give it a 2 star rating because mine melted around the top. This could either be from using it for hot liquids or from putting it in the dishwasher.
2,Be careful with use..,"My cup blistered. The company rep told me that they are not to be used in the microwave or put in the dishwasher. They did replace it, but I noticed on the new cup that were no instructions regarding use."
3,Not up to usual Oxo quality standards,"Similar to other reviewers, my wife and I loved this measuring cup. Every aspect of it was excellent, from ergonomics to utility to style. However, after about two years of very careful use, the cup VERY suddenly developed a crack which emanated from the casting dimple in the bottom center of the cup. The cup immediately started leaking. I do admit our cup saw regular dishwasher use, but never on the lower racks. The cup had never been dropped. The cup essentially still looked virtually like new.I will attempt to buy a bit more time with this cup by repairing with a less viscous two part epoxy. I will have to perform that repair from the bottom so as not to allow the epoxy to seep through and possibly contact future food.Will we buy another? Probably...even recognizing its lifespan limitations."
5,I like this measuring cup,"Great measuring cup. I really appreciate the graduated scale on the inside of the cup, allowing accurate measurement without having to view the cup from the side."
5,Really nice,It is so much easier to look down and measure than hold up a regular measuring cup and hope your hand is steady and even...this is really nice.
1,"Good idea, breaks easily","Like many other reviewers, mine developed a crack after a couple of months of relatively easy use."
4,Great for lefties!,"I got a set of these (including the 2-cup size) because I got tired of using measuring cups for right-handers and either peering through the cup or turning it around opposite for my hand to read the measurement. With the amounts centrally listed IN the cup, there is no problem anymore! It's even possible to work with a right-hander without either getting frustrated. I don't like using plastic in the microwave or dishwasher, so the only downside to me is hand-washing and using something else to heat or melt in the microwave."
4,Good measuring cup,"After reading some of the reviews, I was somewhat reluctant to buy this product, but it went on sale at $3.99, and I decided to risk it.It measures up the the quality and function of most Oxo products. The measurements on the side and inside are completely accurate, which is different from what some have described.I like the cup better than my pyrex ones for dry and cold liquid products, but being plastic, it cannot be used for hot products that contain grease or oil. The handle is ergonomically designed and is easy to scoop flour, sugar, beans, or other bulk products.The only negative is that you have to have another measuring cup for hot, greasy products."
2,Clever but...,"...the darn thing had to be replaced twice in 6 months because it cracked on the bottom, dead center, and the milk I was measuring leaked out.I love the idea, though."
1,First bad OXOperience,"Worked good for a few weeks, but the measurements have flaked off after just a few uses. It's been hand washed with mild detergent, so not sure what's going on...usually Oxo has great build quality and forethought!"
5,"Fabulous, Easy to Use, Accurate and Durable","Not sure what happened with the dissatisfieds I've read on here (perhaps they got the odd defective piece?), but my cup is completely accurate, dead easy to use, and hasn't broken. We heat water in it, put hot liquids in, pretty much use it from A to Z and we've never had a problem or a complaint. OXO makes a great product - give me a similar OXO product to replace my 8 Cup Pyrex, and I'd take it."
1,"Nice design, faulty manufacture","I'm normally a fan of OXO products and own many of their gadgets. These measuring cups are the first problem product I've had from OXO...both the 2 cup and 4 cup sizes cracked on the bottom of the cup, right at the plastic injection point (that little circle with the tiny bump in the center of it), and they both now leak at the crack. These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it's kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason. So mine have gone into the garbage can, replaced by the KitchenAid cups of similar appearance (although without the handy interior measuring marks). My advice, keep your receipt if you buy these. Or skip them and get the KitchenAid, which have a non-slip rubber ring on the bottom, another nice feature. And they won't crack in the dishwasher."
4,"Good design, not as durable as glass","The angled markings make it to convenient to measure without having to look at it from the side. Hard to tell, however, when measuring water or other clear liquids. The pointed spout also pours better than any glass measuring cup I've used. After two years, though, some of the markings on the outside have begun to wear slightly, and the plastic itself is scratched and dinged up. Avoid abrasive scrub pads, and don't let it sit unwashed for too long after measuring oil."
2,Is a Nightmare to Pour!,"I have had this 4 cup measuring cup for some time now, and have not been able to find a suitable replacement for it. It is horrible! Don't get me wrong, the concept is nice, but it doesn't pour worth a darn! I use it to put boiling water in my French Press, to make my coffee. Nearly every time, I have a fair portion spill out, and when you are working with boiling water, that is definitely NOT good!I have the metal 2 cup version of this measuring cup, and it is excellent! Why don't they make the metal version of this one? I would save my $, and buy something else, were I you!"
2,Handle broke off after 1 fall from counter to floor,I purchased this measuring cup with great expectations which were quickly shattered by a fall from the kitchen counter onto the floor. The handle broke off the measuring cup when it hit the floor. I also agree with other reviewers that this measuring cup does not handle fats very well and its spout does not pour very well.
2,Does not pour!,"Looks nice and is accurate. However, if you try and pour liquids slowly (e.g., into a smaller container), half of the liquid will spill onto the counter (or floor)!"
2,Handle breaks off way too easily!,"The design of the cup and graduations is nice. However, the handle is too easily broken. Any excess leverage on the bottom of the handle will crack it off where the cup and handle meet."
3,"MEASURING is a dream, but POURING is a nightmare","Love the fact that you can see DOWN onto the levels in the cup... but the flat ""spout"" (as many have pointed out here) is a severe design flaw. If you have under 4-cups, you can overcome this shortcoming by pouring very, very slowly. Yes, it's annoying, but it works. However, if you have gone crazy (!) and filled it above the 4-cup line (which you can, easily), then you ARE going to spill. Period."
1,poor pouring,"Yes, this item is convenient at measuring liquids. However, it sucks at pouring liquids. No matter how careful I am, liquids spill out the sides onto the counter. I ONLY use it for measuring solids. There must be a better all-rounds measuring cup."
2,I experienced difficulty pouring boiling water from this cup...,"Although this cup was attractive and the marks were easy to see...water flows out of the spout in a wide stream that is difficult to control. For me this meant boiling water all over the French press and the floor. Given that the device is intended for only two things: measuring and pouring, why is it unable to pour in a controlled and predictable manner?!"
5,Great Measuring cup,"The oxo measuringOxo Good Grips 2-Cup Angled Measuring Cupcup is a great little investment. It is handy has a comfort grip, easy to read numbers at any angle. For those of us not given that talent to just eyeball ingredients this is our saving grace in cooking!"
2,"good idea, but not durable","I recieved mine as a gift two years ago. Last month, mine cracked and now leaks at the bottom. I would rather buy a pyrex cup that will last my lifetime intead of something like this that I will have to throw away every two years."
3,substitute,"I just bought the Pampered Chef set and love them. I ordered this for my daughter. It's OK, but I'll get her the PC set next."
1,Doesn't last,This is the second one of these I have owned. This one lasted just a little over a year. The bottom cracks and it leaks. I did put it in the dishwasher and really don't want a baking tool that can not be put in the dishwasher. I thought it said dishwasher safe. Back to a glass measuring cup for me. I have owned and used some of those for 30 years.
4,A Truly Clever Design,"Like other OXO Good Grips products, the handle is slip-resistant and comfortable to hold. What makes this cup better is that, in addition to the marks traditionally found on the outside of a cup, there are also marks INSIDE the cup!Until I started using this measuring cup, I didn't realize how much effort it took to measure liquids. I'd pour something into a cup, bend down to look at the marks on the side, add or remove liquid, then bend down again to check the measurement. Measuring is so much more convenient with this OXO cup since you are able to view the inside marks from overhead.Another reviewer mentions a problem with nesting. I have 2- and 4-cup OXO cups and haven't found this to be a problem: Just make sure the handle of the smaller cup is positioned adjacent to, not directly above, the handle of the larger cup.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it's plastic, which limits the types of liquids that can be used in this cup."
3,"Neat idea, bad material","It's a very neat idea for a measuring cup, but it's made out of VERY thin plastic. It won't take much to crack it (in fact, the first two I ordered came in cracked and had to be shipped back).Would have got 5 stars if it were made of thicker/denser plastic, or even glass. But I don't expect it to last very long before it cracks...."
1,was good until it cracked...,"Yes, well I forked out for this cup because I liked the design. How practical, I thought - the non slip tactile grip, the inside measure of quantity - it looked well made, and I expected it would be long lasting. Unfortunately, having lasted several months, without warning it cracked and I had hot liquid running all over my kitchen bench. I think the product should state clearly somewhere that it is not suitable for hot liquids. At least then the user could use it accordingly. I was unimpressed."
3,"A good try, but not there yet.","This is a plastic measuring cup and does not feel as durable as my old glass Pyrex. The innovative shape makes it difficult to stir in. The purpose of the shape is to make the measurements readable from above, an admirable goal, but it is not accurate. I find that I've got to add a ""smidgen"" over the top line when pouring into the measuring cup and then bend down to check the side anyway just in case.Nice try, Oxo, but needs a little more work."
2,"great idea, but very hard to clean","I love the idea behind this measuring cup, but I have only used it a few times, and it is already sticky!"
2,"Glass not plastic, please!","When I saw this on your website my first reaction was ""I have to have that"". It's exactly what a measuring cup should be EXCEPT IT IS PLASTIC. I'm not going to buy it because of that. When and if you ever make it in glass, I want one in every size!"
4,Extremly Useful,"I have very little space to move around in and this product allows me to not have to bend over to see the level. It being plastic is an advantage for me, but I can see where glass would be better for a more varied use."
2,Needs spout work & much better quality control,"Fully agree with the other reviewer whose cup cracked (the 4-cup one was the first one of the set to do so, and cracked at the mold release ""button"" on the bottom) and the reviewer who remarked that it doesn't pour well. It's only a year old and useless for liquids because of the leak but didn't use it so much for that anyway because of the extremely poor pouring qualities. Now it's only used for measuring dry items. Finally they ALL began to leak at the mold release ""button"" on the bottom, I complained to OXO and they replaced the set. Waiting to see how the new set olds up[-so far, so good!"
1,"Great idea, but sloppily manufactured","The markings along the side don't even match those seen from above. Not that this matters, because both are inaccurate. To the point that it can ruin a recipe for baked goods.In short, it's a great idea, but this measuring cup is so sloppily manufactured that it's pretty much useless."
4,OXO Good grips 70981 2-cup Angled Measuring Cup,"I love everything about this measuring cup except that it's not stackable. I would buy other sizes if it were. Otherwise, it's great!"
4,"Good music, read the details...","When I bought this book, I was misinformed about the songs that it contains. This product contains no official info about the contents. I made the mistake of going of what another commenter said, and not researching further. The other commenter listed a nice amount of songs, which I wanted the music to (I believe around 15ish). This book only contains 8 of the show's ""Top Songs"". I'm not sure who chose this, but I disagree with their selection... but that is beside the point.What I am trying to say is, even though it's not what I wanted, it is a nice book to have.The song list is as follows:Take Me As I AmNo One Knows who I amThis is the momentSomeone like youOnce upon a DreamIn His EyesIt's A Dangerous GameA New LifeThis book also contains a piano accompaniment CD, which was nice."
4,A Great Idea For A Book,Barry Lopez is great. He loves the outdoors so much that he makes us love the outdoors. And the woodcut illustrations makes this a book that stays with you long after you've read it.
5,A beautifully haunting book,"The images in this book, along with the text, create a very beautiful but sad image of life on the highway, for man and animal. I had never heard of Barry Lopez before learning about this book, but his experiences really struck a cord deep within me. When I am on the road and see a dead animal, I always say a quick few words of respect for it. I plan on reading more of Mr. Lopez's books in the future."
4,An exhilarating ride and a steal for the price!,"These are crisp and nimble, yet wonderfully warm blooded readings which contain quite a few interpretive and stylistic surprises. (The finales of the lesser heard Fourth and Eighth symphonies, for example are furiously paced and riveting!) The ensemble playing is tight and precise. Zinman's brisk Toscanini-like tempos flow nicely although they may seem too rushed for some. (If you're a fan of Klemperer's accounts hang on for dear life!). I do have a few quibbles with these recordings, however. The upper strings appear to be tuned to produce a dull, fuzzy period instrument sound throughout. Also, the finale of the Ninth Symphony could have used a fatter and more foreground chorus. The singing is competent but certainly not outstanding. Timid Beethoven novices should avoid the skimpy, confusing and unhelpful program notes and dive right in!"
5,ONE OF THE VERY BEST,"One man's view:Amazing! Every one of these is full of energy, joy and ""snap."" The sense of exuberance makes all a pleasure. I like the peppy tempos here, the lack of passivity all the way. The very quiet passages are played with a wonderful sensitivity. Crank the volume to hear them well? (As has been said, it's the deal of a lifetime on the price. Go!)--check out Hogwood and Solti. Very fine.--also Szell and Christoph von D. cycles.=\=\=--P.S. - check out O'Conor and Arrau on the LVB complete piano sonatas. Beyond belief!=\=\=\="
4,"For the price, it doesn't get much better than this.","As a relative novice to classical music, my review may not be very technical, but I certainly love this collection. The faster tempos help to avoid the tendency of Beethoven's symphonies to get bogged down in melodrama when interpretted by other conductors. At times, however, the pace seemed a little too rushed. The first movements of both the 5th and 9th symphonies suffer from this at times. However, this faster tempo really does justice to the 3rd symphony. The chorus in the 4th movement of the 9th is one of the clearest performances I have ever heard. Also, the 7th symphony is simply breathtaking throughout. While I would not recommend restricting ones listening to these symphonies to this recording (especially the 5th and 9th), this is certainly a quality recording on all levels, and, for the price, can't be beat."
3,Good but not great...,"First off.. it's true that Zinman brings a refreshing speed to these familiar pieces and they work most of the time. It's rather strange to hear Symphony No. 5 at such breakneck speed initially.. but you really do get used to it and may even prefer it after awhile. My biggest constructive criticism for this set (hence the 3/5 stars) is the sound quality. It's plain flat and dimensionless. I own lots of classical recordings, especially ones from Telarc and even some older ones, and I wish this boxset came close to those recordings. It's a shame because the flatness and lack of presence and space of the Zinman recordings betray the otherwise good performances. 3/5 stars."
2,Really not a bargain,"This is definitely not my favorite interpretation of the Beethoven symphonies. The orchestra is hurrying along without much depth. The worst thing for me is that the Beethoven spirit got lost. Compared to interpretations by Masur, Wand, Gardiner, Karajan etc. these warm and passionate works remain cold under Zinman's baton. As background music it's OK but if you are a serious listener who is looking for emotional depth these interpretations are not for you. There are other ""bargain"" editions of these works. For example, I recently purchased the Masur/Leipzig Gewandhaus edition for 32 Dollars. A far better choice."
3,Amazing. Odd. Neat. Good.,"I am really partial to the Karl Bohm Beethoven cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic. One of the reasons is the style of the playing. Lyrical, refined, sophisticated, and fun. These recordings have almost none of that. It is the strangest thing. Beyond ""cold"", there is an absense of musicality that I still haven't quite come to grips with. It's like an audio photograph of the score, rather than a painting. There are plenty of good things to say about them: Nice recording, instruments mostly have excellent tone, and the price can't be beat. But I can't get over the fact that virtually no atmosphere is created. When a rest occurs, it's like the universe just stopped and then blackness..until the little white notes start popping out again."
4,Good version of the Symphonies,"Great sound quality and performance, though a bit fast in tempo, bordering between lively and rushed. That's one interpretation! In a perfect world, you should have a number of different interpretations of these works..."
1,"""Boo...hiss!""","What a bust! PLEASE: Do NOT buy this CD before listening to the previews--the songs on this CD cannot possibly be the original hits remastered, as the cover implies :(If anyone knows of a quality set of re-mastered Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman originals, I would certainly enjoy to hear about it. Thank you!!"

1,Pointless Propaganda Blunder,"It's sad to see how an EU member-state (Greece) denies its citizens (ethnic Macedonian minority), and it's neigbor (Republic of Macedonia) a basic human right - to own identity."
1,Not in condition promised,The condition of this book was quoted as good. It arrived with the binding falling apart and taped together. Definitely not in good shape.
1,Bad service,"I placed order at midnight, then I send email to both amazon and seller to cancel this order right on the next day morning (that means a few hours later). Then I received email from seller to confirm receiving my order. I replied again to cancel this order. But I still had been charged and deliver the book to me."
5,What an incredible book!,"Wow, what a trip down memory lane! As a tail-end baby boomer, I could even relate to items which came out before my time, but which were in my grandmother's home.This book is heavy with good quality photos, advertising and history. I was awash with memories of my childhood, yet learned about some things with which I had contact, but didn't know their origins or time period.One of my biggest laughs were the refrigerators FULL of processed, frozen foods and more meat than most people eat in a year! Land of plenty - of heart attacks!There were items from my youth which are no longer available, and I not only miss them, but realize there are no ubstitutes in today's market. It is amazing how long some items produced 40 years ago would last before we became a throw away society. Not only a must read for the boomers, but maybe an eye-opener for a younger generation."
5,Thank you Sascha!,"Hey, could this cd be any cooler? What a great pairing, Giorgio Moroder mixing KMFDM!"
4,"Good, but not great.","This is definitely worth buying if you are a KMFDM fan. It has the original version (radio edit) and then some strange mixes. The Metropolis Mix and the Paradox mix are a lot heavier than the original mix, while the Poly Matrix edits make you wanna get up and dance! Which is pretty cool, because most KMFDM songs don't do that for me. Kraut, the B side, is silly but good. However, the remixes just aren't as exciting as some of their other remix work (Brute, for instance). So I wouldn't give this 5 stars, though it is really good. Buy it!"
1,Grr,"Well, I ordered the vinyl version, and recieved a CD. Not at all happy, as I do not own a CD player....I feel ripped off."
3,Blah,"Personally I don't care for ""Juke-Joint Jezebel"", I just bought this disc hoping to get something improved or different. Improved maybe, different yes. I enjoyed the Poly-matrix and Metropolis mixes, the rest, however, were quite dull. ""Kraut"" was nothing special either- the original version (from the album Nihil) is better. Oh well, It's worth it."
3,DVD,"This was a very funny movie, however it was kinda hard to follow at times but in the end I would consider it a good movie."
4,Worth owning for one song alone.,"While the dirty guitar mix of dirty epic is a fine, fine track, you only need one reason to own this: REZ."
4,"What a long, engaging ""single""","I bought this for ""Cowgirl"" and was disappointed in the remixes, but fortunately the other tracks blew me away. It is interesting to hear Underworld sing lyrics rather than to spout gibberish. This is a fine disc to make use of your stereo's programming function."

3,A FASCINATING LOOK AT EGO,"This tome earns three stars on the strength of its audacity. Bob Kane is a man who never met an idea he couldn't claim as his own, it seems.Kane made himself very rich on the backs of writer Bill Finger and a host of ghost artists. The narrative in this book, with its clumsy boasts and baldly revised history (including sketches that are almost certainly purposefully misdated to support Kane's claims), provide ample indictment of one man's hubris.But that's not to say it isn't entertaining in its own sad way ..."
1,Go to Target instead!!!!,"This product was a complete waste of money. If you have a spare bag/backpack at home, use the money you would spend on this product at target instead. There is nothing in here that you can't easily acquire yourself and additionally...acquire things of higher quality. Most of the items look like they were purchased at a dollar store and then tossed together as a 'kit'.Example - the poncho that is provided in the kit is not even as durable as a garbage bag. It certainly wouldn't hold up in any kind of disaster situation.There are 3 packs of tissues...I assume this is for all the crying you will be doing in an emergency or the crying you will do once you open up the package to see how much money you have wasted.So do yourself a favor and DON'T purchase any of these kits. Take the time to go to Target or Walmart and buy things that may actually be useful in an emergency."
4,Jazz gold age,A quite complete collection from which you can have a glimpse of the golden years of jazz and listen to the most representative works from a sax master
1,Very Little- River Band,"I have read the previous reviews of this CD and have to agree with the first two. This band is NOT the Little River Band. It is NOT a ""morphed"" version of this highly sucessful band either. It is simply a ""cover"" or ""tribute"" band using the name to try to sell it's product. This one won't even sell on eBay. It put a severe hurt on my ears. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,One Night in Mississippi,"A nice overview of what the current lineup of Little River Band does: provide smooth harmonies, crisp playing and tight rhythms. This band rock live. However, the lack of audience noise in this recording leaves the listener with a recording that is much mellower than an actual show. The presence of new songs This Place, Who Made The Moon and I Think I Left My Heart With You shows new growth from a band that has endured many changesover the years."
1,This is not the real little River Band,"Fans are entitled to know that this is not the real original little River Band.This recording is by a tribute band.The album does not have the original lead singer or any of the founding members and it does not sound at all like the original band.Buy it at your own risk.It's a bit like former Beatles drummer Pete Best releasing an album as ""The Beatles"",although as outrageous as that seems,at least Pete Best WAS an original founding member of The Beatles whereas the members of this weak and insipid LRB tribute band were definitely not.They have just hijacked someone else's legacy,which is disgraceful."
4,The Tradition Continues,"In looking over some of the previous reviews submitted to this site it pained me to see pot shots being taken at the makeup of the present band. While it is true that this band is not original, they are the LRB as it has morphed over the years. And they are very good. I have heard this album and seen them in 2002 concert and I can truthfully say, as a die hard LRB fan I was on my feet the entire time. As for the album in question, it represents the best of LRB captured in a dynamic environment. Anyone who has appreciation for the continuation of the LRB's legacy will no doubt like what they hear."
1,Save your money - pass on this CD !,"Save your money and don't buy this CD. If you're looking for a live CD by the REAL Little River Band, pick up ""Backstage Pass"". ""One Night In Mississippi"" was recorded by a band of imposters - not one member was an original band member. The classic LRB harmonies are not here - pass on this CD."

3,Iconic & Ironic,"After a long delay, the Lost Episodes DVD finally surfaced by a different publisher.The irony is the episodes on the disc are edited and a local Christian station ""TBN"" is presently airing the full version of those same episodes. Go figure..."
3,This is cut!,3/5. Davey and Goliath is always fun to watch and I was looking forward to this uncut DVD. I have the 'Down on the Farm' episode on tape (if you are a D&G; fan you know what's in this episode) but it was CUT! The most outrageous scene of D&G; was tragically removed! AGHH!!!So the good news: This is kid freindly!The bad news: I guess we'll never see the uncut episodes on DVD.If you really are expecting uncut epsiodes...DON'T buy this! Just buy it if you really want more D&G; on DVD.You know...they ought to just release D&G; by season or just release 'The Complete Series' on DVD. (uncut please!)
2,Huge Fan of the Real Davey & Goliath - Not This,"They don't make bigger fans of Davey & Goliath than me, which is why I'm disappointed they decided to edit these episodes. Have we gotten so sensitive as a society that we can't even tolerate a childrens' show (dripping with family values), as it aired in the 1960s and 70s? They released the original Sesame Street in tact (albeit with a warning)-- Why couldn't they have shown the same respect for Davey? I'm not going to go into the details about what they cut, I just think it's unfortunate, since it was one of the most innocent shows around. I still adore the show, I just don't adore the people who think they are judges of what others should see. It's censorship of the original series, plain and simple.Oh, and the episode menu selection doesn't work correctly (Select ""Whatshisname"" and you'll be directed to ""Down on the Farm"".) Maybe they should stop censoring episodes and proof the DVD before releasing it."
5,Quit playing around!!,This dvd was supposed to have been released twice already. It has been moved from May to September. I wish they (whoever) would come out and tell us why this dvd keeps being pushed back. This is getting pretty old.
4,Classic never go out of style,"Davey and Goliath what can you say, a great tradition andgood lessons for kids. Even though outdated the workthat went into these stories is fascinating. Watch outfor quality keep receipts and wait until you watch themto see if they really work,one D&G; DVD skipped and keptstopping and starting."
3,"Somewhat worth the wait, but ""lost episodes"" are missing!","After nearly a three year wait, we finally get this release of the long awaited missing ""unpolitically correct"" D&G episodes..I have the entire D&G collection except about 5, so I did get a few ""new"" episodes I didn't have.......BUT.....TWO lost episodes are still missing, which are ""ON THE LINE"" & ""HEAD OF THE HOUSE"" and they are both not on this DVD and have been removed from television since approx. the mid 1980's! I aquired my near complete collection in 1984 and already had most of the recently removed episodes. My version of ""Down On The Farm"" does contain Davey's infamous ""diving nude scene"" with his private parts shown (yikes)which has been edited out of the newly released DVD. It just seems if you are going to promote a rare lost episodes DVD, they should all be there and not be edited! Davey's diving scene in ""Down On The Farm"" is so harmless and should not have been edited from this new DVD!"
3,poor screen,"If you can afford the NX models and don't mind the extra weight, go with those models. My criteria for choosing this model were size/weight, processor speed, and price, in that order.This is a great little product. Compared to the Palm m500, this is about 2-4 times faster. I don't particularly like the keyboard because the keys are not raised. I find that the design of the Palm Tungsten is much easier to use. I do have to agree with the other reviewers that it's arkward to tap with the stylus and type with the keyboard. Because of the extra step in accessing the graffiti input area, I have migrated to using the keyboard.The screen is great, except for one little thing. The backlight has to be on all the time. Without the backlight, the screen is hardly visible."
4,"I love my Clie, but XP doesn't","I have had a pda since the early '90's..Casio Boss to all the early palms, but I love my tg50. The keyboard is great..grafitti is slow and hard to learn, especially numerals. You definitely need a memory stick and a sturdy case.I have sent mine in for repairs twice: once for a cracked screen and the second for loss of backlighting. Each reapir cost $138 and I conducted all communications via their website. I just lost the backlighting again and I am going to have to make a tough decision. another $138 doesn't make sense...especially since the XP version of Outlook doesn't sync to it. You have to buy Intellisync ($50) to make it work.Although the tg50 has a number of great features, I think my next purchase will be a pocket pc.Buy one on ebay and don't get too attached."
1,Does not work with Windows XP and Outlook 2002,"The SONY PDA does not synchronize with MS Outlook as advertised. This is not an isolated problem. I have seen many postings on the Internet concerning this issues. SONY does not have a solution.I have a DELL Notebook running Windows XP and Outlook 2002 over a standard office network.I have spoken to SONY Tech Support 4 times for over 6 hours! I have reinstalled every piece of related software (SONY, Intelisync and Outlook) and still I cannot synchronize with my computerI own a number of Sony product including my home computer and a digital camcorder. I am very disappointed in SONY and cannot recommend this product."
5,What you see is what you get.,"I bought this ring for my roommate for his birthday. It is just like it looks in he picture. Good solid, light but detailed. Well below the cost of what I saw it for in a popular retail store. I say if you like the look, buy it."
3,nice ring,"a tad bit hollow inside, nothing a that i coulden't fix with a tourch an some silver wire. still a great ring, worth the trouble."
4,Great Ring!,"The detail of the skull on this ring is pretty amazing - especially for the price. And the fact that the skull is upraised allows the ring to be used like a signet or seal ring (the skull can be pressed into melted letter wax). The only problem I've had with it is that the back of the skull impression is hallowed out, so that there is air trapped between my finger and the ring, and this causes my finger to sweat a little. But, for such a great looking ring, it's certainly something I can live with."
2,Not as good a value for the $$ as it appears,"I used these as rewards & I needed a large amount of them. The ""subscribe & save"" price was comparable to the sale price in the store, so I opted to have them shipped to me rather than make the trip to the store. All would have been well except that more than half of the 12 boxes had only 4 fruit rolls instead of the labelled 6. NOT A GOOD DEAL ANYMORE! I've cancelled my subscription & will likely not ""subscribe & save"" with any additional products."
4,Adequate,"These are sufficient to prevent scratching, but they're quite thin and stiff. It would be nice if they provided a big more padding and protection from breakage. That having been said, at the price I feel they're a good value."
5,Worth the Price,"I was pleasantly surprised at the weight of the dividers.If you need additional dividers for storing dishes, these will do the job at a very reasonable price."
3,Too Thin,"These plate dividers served the purpose, but in my opinion were way too thin. I felt like I needed to use 2 or 3 in order to get enough cushioning between my dishes."
4,Pretty good.,These are pretty good.Just know that they're a grey-ish white and there is they occasional non-white fiber in them.They're functional.I bought a second set. No regrets.
3,"Worked ok, but small","This divider set is convenient to use, however the dividers themselves are rather small. After using them, I determined that I would probably fare better to just buy felt pieces from a craft store."
5,Excellent liners!,For your china protection needs these dividers do an excellent job. Good quality and the correct size for all china.
3,THIN plate protectors,"They really need to change the picture on this item. It is showing square protectors but the item I received are round protectors. Where is the truth in advertising? They are ample in size but are very thin pieces of felt pads. I thought perhaps they should be thicker, just like the Hagerty ones are. Had I known they were so thin, I would have ordered 2 packages of them. Hopefully they will serve their purpose but I might have to double up on them."
5,Replacing a Classic,"My daughter-in-law grew up with and learned to cook with 1936 edition. I knew that most of that edition was destroyed in a fire long ago. Hers was in tatters and could be referred to as ""loose leaf"". This edition was almost a duplicate and really delighted her."
5,Love this utensil rack,"I love this OXO utensil rack. It looks very stylish and is easy to install. I have now bought 3. We cut it down to fit the space we have and it cuts easily. Also, the hooks are long so it is easy to store those items with thick handles."
5,Great! Easy to Install!,I bought two of these utensil racks and they are great for my small space. They are extremely easy to install and come with a template to help you mount them to a wall. They look streamlined and modern on the wall. I actually am using one as a key rack for inside my kitchen door and the other for stainless steel utensils and oven mits next to the stove. LOVE THEM!
5,The Real story,"Just purchased this item last week and I am in love with it. Here's all you need. A 3/16"" drill bit and a philips bit. Once you measure and mark off where you want to install the rack your pretty much done. It is very simple as long as you have the drill bits your fine. Its only for utensiles of course the hooks dont come out far enough to hang pots. So as long as you have your hangable utensiles and color coordinated because since you can install it almost anywhere you choose it will make you seem like a more serious chef without the need of fumbling for what your looking for when you forget that spoon not that one the one with the holes. So this makes the kitchen look and feel more organized."
5,Just what I needed,Perfect fit under my cabinet space. Exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend it to anyone.love the finish
1,not a good idea,"the product is not what I was expected. Guess I paid for what I received. Very fragil, arrived broken. buy a better one if you can!"
3,Difficult to Install,"The unit looks nice and works well--but installation is not easy. It's nearly impossible to remove the screw covers (which are supposed to ""slide easily""); we finally managed it with a pair of pliers. Additionally, the hole size that was recommended for the wall anchors was off."
2,Utensil rack,The Oxo steel kitchen tool and utensil rack was absolutely beautiful and just what I wanted until I tried to hang my utensils on the hooks (that was before I would have installed it). The reason I had to return it was that the hooks were too big for the holes in my utensils. There was no way to exchange the hooks for smaller ones.
3,Needs help!,"Bit of a major problem with this item: once the end-pieces are screwed tight to the wall, they deform slightly and make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to slide-on the steel covers.I bought three of these, so I know it wasn't just a one-off problem.Anyway, solution: disassemble the end pieces (two metal parts, one plastic part)put a blob of epoxy resin between the plastic part and the rear metal part, and re-assemble the three parts. Once the epoxy has set, slide off the front cover, and proceed as normal.Once mounted, these look pretty nice...and not bad value for money either."
4,Oxo Steel Kitchen Tool and Utensil Rack,"Good product for Kitchen utensils however, not recommended for hanging pots & pans as previously read by other posters. Moveable hooks which are convenient, however, they are limited in what they are able to hold. I can double up on spoons, spatulas, potato mashers and such but, I just can't see how other posters were able to hang pots & pans(hooks not long enough). Putting together is a bit clumsy but, for the price, I would say it serves it's purpose."
4,Oxo Kitchen Tool & Utensil Rack,"I installed 2 of these, 1 on either side of my custom made range hood. Works great, very convenient."
4,Handy Tool Rack,"This tool rack serves a purpose. I do a lot of cooking and need utensils at the drop of a spoon. It is much easier to reach for what I need, than to fumble around in a drawer. The only draw back for me is that there are not enough slide pins to hold my utensils individually. I have doubled up on many, but it still makes cooking easier than having all utensils in a drawer."
2,Simple but serious flaw,"This product consists of a bar with hooks. It should be difficult to mess this up, but they found a way - too few hooks. As pictured, there are six hooks. I have some fairly wide items hanging (measuring cups, ladles, etc.), and there is still plenty of room for more hooks. This is annoying - several spatulas and measuring cups, taken care of. But now I've still got to find a space for my meat cleaver, wooden spoon and several other items. This should be a non-issue.It looks fine, but most people will likely hang this on a wall underneath kitchen cabinets, so the aesthetics really don't matter. It functions fine, but I probably would not buy it again."
1,made in china again?,"searched made in usa kitchen utensiles and this came up. looked like a ok design, made of stainless steel. looked for made in china that amazon promised me would be in the description if it was. bought it and delivered to me on time. now i am going through the hassel af returning the item because amazons search engine lied to me again. i guess the only way they will learn is to keep returning the falsely advertised merchandise."
5,great,it makes my kitchen look great! its not flimsy like I was worried it would be and its very easy to attach to the wall.
3,More work to put up,"Looks nice, but not easy to put up. I bought the tape that was suggested by Amazon in the ""others bought this with it"" section, hoping to just stick it on the wall. The tape only holds very small weights and my utensils are heavy so now I have to drill holes, etc. To me, more work than I wanted, otherwise, it's a nice rack.I was disappointed to find that they don't have additional hooks that I can buy for it. It only has six hooks. I wanted more and thought I could add to it. I contacted OXO to get more, only to find that they're not made/available.I also didn't measure before I bought it (stupid). It's too big for the side of the top cabinet I wanted to hang it on."
4,Handy hanger but seems like you could use 2 more hooks,I like this but there are only clips for 6 items. I think if I had 2 more hooks then it wouldn't feel as empty as it does right now since I just have spoons and one turner on it. Decent quality and strong metal though so it should last a while and a lighter pan or two may even be supported if a person decided to place them on the rack.
5,Beautiful,It looks great in my kitchen and holds perfectly my cook utensils! I surly recommend this product so you can have easy access to your most important tools!
4,Simple and Affordable,"I wanted something to keep my BBQ utensils within hands reach and not thrown together in the bottom of the grill. I was skeptical at first due to the low price of this item, thinking that I would be getting a piece of junk. The item fits my needs perfectly. It was easy to install(I did use a masonry bit) to the concrete exterior wall of my house. All of my essential tools are now close to me when I am grilling.I would have given the product 5 stars if it was slightly larger and had just about 3 more hooks but I believe it will fit most people's needs."
4,Truly a great sophmore album by Duncan!,"I love the references to great musical influences on ""Says it All"". ""Bite your Tongue"" will of course be popular like ""Barely Breathing"" was. Over all, a great album by one of my favorite new artists!"
5,An effort to listen to...but well worth it!,"I must admit that when I first listened to this album, I felt that I could never listen to it again. The anger and cynicism that pours from each song overwhelmed me. I was in a dark mood, and found it difficult to escape it. However, various tracks kept replaying themselves in my mind, and I was forced to re-listen. The original shock has been replaced by a deeper understanding of myself, and perhaps, of Duncan Sheik. Having been through Hell the past few years, I understand Sheik's lyrics in a way that only experience can bring. He has captured all the frustration that comes having everything we trust betray us. I applaud Sheik's efforts in this album, and anxiously await new insights in a third..."
5,pulls ya in and leaves you suspended in mid air!,"Duncan Sheik's new cd Humming is just amazing. I've been anxiously awaiting Duncan's sophmore album for quite awhille not unlike many others. Now that we all have it we can't stop raving. The first single ""Bite Your Tongue"" is sure to be stuck in your head in no time. ""That says it all is a protest song but at the same time a homage to the great artists before him..Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, John Lennon......etc. Hummming has not stopped spinning since I got it and now it's developing lazer grooves. My friends already want to chuck me and it out the window because I constantly have it playing. Enjoy this CD!"
3,"Pleasant, but not moving","I'm not a huge fan Duncan, but I always enjoy his work. His softer, quieter, and logical approach towards life's deeper aspects always brings some comfort through the ever-constant, swooning, mellow melodies. With this particular release, he tries to diversify a bit more in his approach, but I feel his efforts fall short, and instead of strengthening his appeal, he actually weakens it just a bit here. Songs like ""In Between"" and ""Varying Degrees of Con-Artistry"" carry the same effect we've grown used to, but there are not enough of these songs. I find myself humming these tunes rather than considering most of the other tracks. Despite the slight lack of appeal mentioned, the CD is still a descent buy. I just feel it could be better had he taken a different direction with some of the material."
3,Hmmmm,"I dunno what to say about this album. Reading all the glowing reviews that it's had, it makes me wonder if I'm missing something. It's not as if I haven't given it a chance. Whenever I buy a new cd, I listen to it over and over until I really know it. I have had it about a year now, and after the initial hearings, I just couldn't seem to enjoy it that much. And today prior to reviewing it, I listened to it about 3 times all the way through so I could give it a fair rating. It's not that it's a bad album...it's not. But there's just something that doesn't click for me, and that alone is very unusual as I love a huge variety of musical styles and genres. I guess I find it hard to associate his voice with the string orchestra...it seems not to fit. And sometimes his voice seems strained and bland. ""A body goes down"" though is a real good track. In fact the ones without the orchestra I prefer more. But I shall still listen to this cd once in a while, it may grow on me."
2,At it's best this reminds me of Crowded House,"There are four songs in this cd which i really liked : ""In Between"",""Bite your Tongue"",""Alibi"" and ""Nothing Special"".Even though none of them has what you would call a psychedelic hook or a sentimental storm,they all stand out for a calm beauty of their own.And,quitte frankly,they are expected to be that way if only you consider the low profile of Duncan Sheik.The problem with the rest of the tracklist is that the tunes don't stay in memory for more than an hour.I actually had to listen to some of them two or three times to be able to remember how they go.In addition to all that,Sheik's voice is simply too colourless to give the depth needed to melodies like ""Nichiren"".On the whole ""Humming"" is a decent offering from an artist who surely has the talent to write some elegant guitar-pop songs but seems to be unable to deliver anything more."
4,this is a good record,"at first i thought..whoa, this is way slower than the first. it took me a few listens to get through it well, and ive come to really like it. it isnt as intense as the first record. it isnt as melodic as the first record. but that ok, its a great record, just being what it is. i like duncan. i just wish i got as many chicks as he does."
1,DUNCAN FALLS APART ON SOPHOMORE EFFORT.,"Sheik completely falls apart on his second effort ""Humming"". The first single ""Bite Your Tongue"" is obviously his labels doing trying to get him out in the main stream as a rock artist. The album has some tasteful tidbits like ""Alibi"" and ""Nichren"", otherwise this CD is the next best thing to falling asleep short of valium."
2,A step backwards,"The follow up to his wildly popular self-titled debut, ""humming"" has Duncan Sheik trying valiantly to reinvent himself. Alas, great songs are needed to make a great album, and while he occasionaly gets back up to the level he set in his debut, this album is found wanting. ""Bite your tongue"" is a painfully embarrassing song to listen to. I have a tough time believing that the same songwriter who crafted ""little hands"" and ""Serena"" could make [junk] like this. Ah well, I look anxiously forward to future albums. Once a fan..."
1,HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I must say Sheiks first CD was at his best. This CD is so drab I almost fell asleep listening to it. The only cut with life is the first single ""Bite Your Tongue"" which I thought the rest of the CD would follow like, but instead it ran for the Unisom. Buy his first CD, forget this one."
5,Great band from Ohio,This band is awesome I remember going to their show at Section 8 skate park before they got signed a couple of years ago. Great band!!!! Can't wait to see them again...
1,Music is going down the drain,"Staples debut album is just terrible. It sounds like a mixture of System Of The Down & really REALLY bad KORN. I was excited to hear the cd, since I've been hearing such wonderful things about this band. I'm only glad the used store gave me $4 bucks for it. The guitars in the album are very weak and they need to have another guitar player in the band, to balance out the same drum beat over and over again. Stay away from this record."
5,awesome band,this band has their own sound i can't explain...its just so awesome. demon hunter used to be my favorite hardcore christian band now staple is!
1,"DOES NOT Accommodate a wide range of jars, as claimed.!",One Star because there is not an option of giving Zero (0) stars! Jar opener looks nice and is easy to hold but most jar lids will not fit in the teeth of jar opener and the opening is to small for larger jars. I tried opening a jar of salsa with a small average lid. Lid wouldn't stay in jar opener and teeth could not get a good grip on lid. The lid kept coming out. I've also tried to open a jar of Prego Spagetti sauce and the lid would barely go in the opening. NOT A VERY GOOD DESIGN FOR SUCH A GOOD COMPANY.
1,Looks great but doesn't work well,"I used to have a jar opener like this, but it was mounted to the bottom of my kitchen cabinet. That worked wonderfully because I could use both hands to pull and turn the jar against it. This tool limits you to one hand pushing (with the jar opener) and one hand turning the jar. Unless you can really ram it against the lid, you'll only succeed in gouging the lid, not in actually turning it. If you haven't the hand strength to open the jar without this, chances are this won't help you."
2,Slow it down.,"This book pushes the student to learn all the alphabet, acents, and pronounciation in the first 6 page lesson. This is too fast for any but the most committed student. The lack of in text examples makes a good discussion with someone else an essential element in learning greek using this text."
3,A little Information !!!!,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this camera less than six months ago, (from Best Buy, not in a big hurry to pay a restock fee) and I've already had to replace the battery twice and the charger once.When it ""worked"" it was fine, but now HP's customer services answer to the fact the charger isn't charging the new battery is to buy a new battery.It's ridiculous to have to buy a new battery for every day I use the camera. (which happened when I took it on vacation to Georgia. The battery died in one day.)My recommendation? DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. One of my family members works for HP and she recommends the same thing. I wish I would have known before I threw my money away on this item. I am now looking for a new digital camera and a friend has suggested Nikon. (he's a professional photographer, so I'm going to take his recommendation.)I'm so disappointed in this product and more disappointed in the lack of customer service. Never again will I buy an HP product."
3,upset,"I ordered 10cds in nov.hoping to receive them in time for christmas for my kids to enjoy and till now I still haven't received them,can't even track them either and am being asked to review what exactly I can't say.the whole purpose of ordering for the cds have been defeated. Not impressed at all.ordered for items online last week and I received them on 24th."
4,Not what we expected...,"Video quality is not that awesome and the stories were not what we expected. A bit disappointed. I know it's gotten good reviews, but this was now for us."
5,Christmas classic!,"I love this DVD, it is a must have for Christmas time, especially if you have children! The quality is not terrific, but what can you expect with cartoons from the 1930's?"
1,Surprisingly poor media,"Media code is MCC 01RG20, which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation. They have an excellent reputation, which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is.I'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision.The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors, and visible dye damage. The second at 4X also had visible dye damage, but my recorder was able to read each sector. My Sony DVD player (older and picky) couldn't read it.A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle (at least the title screen comes up, and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc). There's still visible dye damage, so I'm skeptical.Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like (have to burn at 2.4X with my +R media to achieve that), I'm quite disappointed with the results."
3,Disappointment is guarenteed for the true Mott fan...,"I was so excited to see this at the record store as it was Mott's greatest hits finally remastered and expanded then i found out the truth.There are cuts or edits in several of the songs and it just makes me furious because there was absolutely no reason for it!The cd is about 45 minutes long so it's not like there wasn't enough room. What a rip off!They also could have included many more songs to make this special...but the commitment just wasn't there.The piano intro to ""All the way from memphis"" is cut then the explosive guitar solo that concludes the song is faded out.How can you destroy such a classic!There's also a cut in one of the so called BONUS tracks in ""One of the boys"".The song is faded out before the silence then the final roaring climax!Now the thing that gets me is that Columbia Legacy usually does a good job in compiling these colections but not this time.What a shame because Mott The Hoople deserves so much better.o.f."
1,Waiting for the TRUTH!,"Mr. Hunt , like so many, has been duped by Castro's obvious split personality. He has two: one for the cameras and the curiosity-seekers and the one he reserves exclusively for Cuban people. Mr. Hunt has been dazzled by the charismatic image of an espresso drinking, cigar- smoking figure donning military fatigues babbling tiresome rhetoric of an out of vogue ideology. Instead, he failed to capture the truth: a paramilitary totalitarian guerrilla whose oppressive rule has destroyed a nation, separated families and friends merely to satisfy his sadist megalomanic delusions. I remain amazed at what reporters and tourists would never tolerate in this country considering romantic in Cuba! Well, there is nothing romantic about living without free elections, free speech and the right to travel freely without persecution. I would love to discuss the evils of Marxist economics in Cuba but I am limited to a 1,000 words maximum."
3,Not bad,"Like other reviewers, I struggled at times with this book. It's easy reading, but drags in the middle by getting bogged down in historical recounting. Having said that, you do get a sense of what it is like to live in Cuba, so I definitely think it is worthwhile to push through this one. I also wish Hunt had been less innocent and made different choices at times."
2,Missing the beat!,"The premise starts off hopefully enough as the author sets out, ostensibly to find Fidel, but as you read, you realize this is an insincere focus that Hunt makes no attempt to bring to fruition. The author seems to be floundering without purpose. Worse, he seems incapable of analyzing or understanding what he experienced or witnessed in Cuba, so that the reader comes away with only the flimsiest sense of 'the Cuban experience.' Where is the sensuality; the tension; the sense of Alice in Wonderland duality that makes Cuba so engaging? Hunt's drab writing style doesn't help. I struggled to finish the book."
4,Good Read,"This is a great read - maybe a little young, but it would be good for a high schooler or someone younger with dieting/body image issues. It doesn't glorify eating disorders, but paints a relatable image."
4,The Hunger Scream,"I have read this partuclar book from open to close. At first when I started to read the book I though that it was going to be very thought provoking and would lead me into great detail about certain feelings and situations. Unfortunately, this bok is not that emotional. The author writes as though she wants this book to be emotionally drawn butits not detailed enough to captavate the readers or the audiences sensitive side. This book doesnt seem to answer the question of why in full detail. I feel that the author is trying to make this book out to be more tht what was put into it. When I started to read the book I wanted to know what was going to happen next, but as I went on I lost all interest. This book lacks the motivational need to capture the reader's attention and focus through the novel and not just at certain parts. I feel however that with a little more effort and research on anorexia this book could be capable of winning attention."
4,"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! (screaming, get it?)",This energetic book is a sure win! I enjoyed the experience and I recommended it to all of my friends!
4,If you wonder how things got they way they are.....,"During an expat job in the UK, I would wonder how the countryside there got many of the features you see there. This book did a very good job of explaining the origins of roads, walls, forests, woods, pastures, hedges, etc in the UK. I look forward to tracking down a few more of Rackham's books on other parts of the world."
5,A Must Read For All Wanting Healthy Teeth,This book is very informative and helpful. It is amazing to learn how easy it can be to have a healthy mouth and what we can do to achieve it. I highly recommend this book to all that want to take charge of their health.
2,No basis for the author's claims,"The author lists many causes of gum disease, including stress, but does not give any references to peer-reviewed studies. Similarly, she recommends many natural products, such as rosemary toothpaste for ""activating the metabolism of the outer layer of gum tissue to improve cell regeneration"", but does not give any references. Because she does not cite bases for her claims, I have very little confidence in her recommendations. She also discusses the use of ""heart energy"" and meridians that connect the teeth to other parts of the body. I'm not saying these modalities are phony, but the lack of observable evidence of their efficacy makes me reluctant to pursue them. I would try ""Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye"" if you are looking for a book that incorporates peer-reviewed studies. Its a good place to start."
4,Difficult Choices Made In Wartime,"'A Soldier's Tale' released in '89 is a surprisingly good, little known film about a WWII soldier named Saul (Gabriel Bynes) who moves in with Blle, a beautiful woman (Marianne Basler)while his platoon is temporoary camped outside a French town recently occuppied by the Nazis. Belle is hated by the community for fraternizing with the Nazis and a group of male vigilantes stalk the poor girl waiting for a chance to kill her. Saul protects her while during his stay, but is consumed with the prospects of what may happen to her when his company moves out.Will her desert and stay to protect her, find her a safe house where she will be protected or leave her to whatever fate awaits?Hard hitting, honest look at the unexpected casualities of war and the colateral damage that takes place when the combatants move on."
5,Not just a book for your coffee table...,"I confess: I love photography and I love diving. I guess it's not the most original combination, but that's what led me to David Doubilet's work.This book, along with 'Light in the Sea' (which unfortunately happens to be out of print) show an incredible sample of some of the most beautiful photographies, where he demonstrates his handle on this most complicated medium, such as the sea is, by generating trully breathtaking pictures."
5,A Rollercoaster Ride,"This story, set during the depression, takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride. After a fast action start, it settles into a quieter pace, giving the reader a great slice of '30's living while still advancing the plot. Then it makes unexpected twists and turns again at the end. All in all, a great read."
4,Nice egg shakers,I ordered 4 and received all black ones. But my children love them and they don't get to fight over who gets what color.
5,Great fun for little ones,My 1.5 year-old daughter fell in love with this egg shaker during her Music Together class. Now she can shake along to her favorite songs at home! It's perfect for her little hands and seems very sturdy.
1,Bad dvd wouldnt play all the way through,Bought this movie for my father and it didnt play all the way through. At first i thought maybe it was his dvd player. But i tried it with mine and it did the same thing. Received the dvd saturday evening and it was played sunday night. While trying to return it on the website it says return window closes that monday!?!?!? So how could it be returned?? Im out $20.00 so its not too bad but still upsetting that i cant return it.
4,The American Heliocentric Ephemeris 2001-2050,"This is a must for astrologers who believe Heliocentric data affect us (which I do believe, because what is more important than the Sun?). Before buying this book, I used Michael Erlewine's THE SUN IS SHINING which required a lot of computation. Now I can save time for doing research in something more interesting."
1,Not really a phone cord,This product is a cord to plug between the wall and the outlet. I thought it was a handset cord and it does not fit at all.
4,THIS IS DEFINITLY WORTH YOUR MONEY,TIGHT WHY IS EVERY 1 HATIN THIS ALBUM IF YOU COLLECT NO LIMIT RECORDS THIS IS A GOOD CD TO ADD
1,This is the worst No Limit cd that I have ever purchased!,This cd is terrible. I have all the No Limit cd's and this is the worst one. Don't buy it.
3,The tradgedy of Verminaard,"This book tells the tale of the life of Verminaard, the Dragon highlord of Dragons of Autumn Twilight. I have to say that I liked this book, to a degree. It starts very slowly and I had a hard time keeping focused during the boring beginning. But the book does pick up and become more interesting when Verminaard begins to fall from grace. The characters aren't the greatest, but the the ending is good. I see this book as a regular Greek tradgedy. Many people die and Verminaard cannot be saved from the hand of evil. But the most sad thing was that through this story, the Dark Queen gets her revenge on Huma. I won't say how, but to a person who's first Dragonlance novel was the Legend of Huma, it can seem really devastating. Read it, and you might enjoy it."
2,Just Not Interesting,"This is the story of Verminaard, unloved [...] son of Solamnic Knights, and his road to evil. Though far from being a bad book, it just didn't draw me in. Verminaard's evilness seems to be inborne rather than reactionary, to the point that the supposed contributing factors - the unloving father, the loss of the beloved brother - seem more like asides and much less sympathetic. Likewise with his half-brother Aglaca, who is unfailingly upbeat and loyal for no apparent reason. I understand the story the Williamses were trying to tell, and it took a while to put my finger on what was wrong. Then I realized it was missing a vital element of all great drama: levity. The human experience is not serious all the time. Even in the grimmest tales there is laughter. The unrelenting depression of this book left me frankly unmoved."
3,Strong Start. . . but a downhill journey,This book had a lot of promise and potential but any experienced reader can tell that the writer rushed the ending and left to many items poorly explained. Verminaard was not the Fearless warrior that I had pictured him to be at first (which gave me a low opinion of him from the first confrontation). It was only when he was consumed by evil did he fight without fear. It wasn't horrible but it could have been a lot better.
4,Before the Mask - hautingly beautiful,"The first two words that come to my mind when I think of Beforethe Mask are:hauntingly beautiful. That probably sounds weird, butit's the best way I can think of to describe it. It created imagas both horrible and wonderful. True, there was not as much action and adventure as in most DL books, but over all, I loved it. It did what it was supposed to do - show how Verminaard became so twisted and evil. They created the perfect story line (I really enjoyed how they tied Verminaard and Ember together, creating a strange love/hate relationship between them). The Voice was really creepy, always hiding in the darkness, waiting to distort the way Verminaard thought. If you want a book with tons of action, adventure, and magic, then this isn't for you. But if your looking to read a book that's all around dark and gothic and very well written, consider this a must. Loyal DL readers should read it to."
3,The title says all,"The book really is about the life of Verminaard, before coming to be a Dragon Highlord. It starts pretty good, but ends with a sizzle. Reading about characters, who were invented by others and of whom we know that they die, just isn't that exciting. The writers are quite good and should stick to the other kind of non-limit Dragonlance writing."
4,"""MIDNIGHT!!!!!""","Before the mask is definitely recommended for those who would like to know why, actually, is Verminaard the way he is? You get to find out what really drove him to be an evil and powerfull addition to the ranks of the dragon army. Also it tells of his mace ""nightbringer""(MIDNIGHT!!!). Got a druid in there too. All in all a good book."
2,What a disappointment!,"I'm not the kind of person who watches a movie or reads a book based on the actors in it or who wrote it. A good actor can make a horrible movie just as easily as a bad actor can & vice verca.Same goes for writers - although I haven't read a bad Weis & Hickman book yet. However, Micheal Williams has butchered every DL book he has ever written. He absolutely bores me to death.I couldn't wait to read this book because I loved Emperor Of Ansalon & Black Wing. I thought this was going to be another good villian based book. Even though I hadn't liked any of the other Williams books, I thought this was a can't miss. Unfortunately, I was bored by page 130.I have to add this one to Weasel's Luck,Galen Beknighted,The Companions,Darkness & Light and Kendermore as DL books to skip."
1,DragonLance????,"This is absolutely the worst DragonLance book I have ever read. It is confusing and there isn't much of an apparent plot. I am probably one of the biggest DragonLance fans ever and I buy everything that has the DragonLance logo on it simply because I like to collect the stuff. Unless you are like me and buy it because it says Dragonlance, do NOT buy this book. It has no literary value whatsoever. If I were TSR, I would be ashamed to have DragonLance on its cover."
3,"Mike Williams' best book, which isn't saying much.",At last: A Dragonlance book with NO kender! Yessssss
2,Do not bother again,Style=LAtype=more performance than socialMost of the bad points in this couples first dvd are repeated in this 2nd dvd.Do not bother to buy.There are far better Salsa instructional dvd's being sold on Amazon.This dvd is a waste of money.
3,catchy,thanks to the Musical genius of R.kelly doing the vocals this cut works pretty well.they got the groove from the Lunz I got 5 on it but it blends well with Puffy&R.kelly.good story line&all. if Puffy didn't rap&this had have been R.kelly doing the whole track then this would be a Higher Record for me.still catchy though.
2,"""Hits"" Album Marks Death Knell for Collins' Rock/Pop Career!","I suppose I can only give this album a 2 since (a.) many Phil Collins fans probably already own most of the material on the album, dating back to circa 1980s...Phil's heyday, and (b.) Phil probably just wants to ""cash in"" on those past laurels, especially now that he and ""Genesis"" pals Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford have apparently parted ways! His new directions -- playing drums with the ""Buddy Rich Orchestra,"" and doing the sound-overs for a ""Tarzan"" animation -- could either be a genuinely new ""talent trail"" for Collins, OR a complete ""boondoggle"" for a performer whose best days are now behind him! Only time will tell, of course. Either way, Phil Collins' contributions to the Progressive Rock scene (via Genesis) and Pop music in general are now the stuff of music history! And we will all no doubt miss the ""old"" Phil Collins sound...regardless of what his ""new incarnation"" looks and sounds like!"
3,Offensive man guilty of pop genius,"I have to admit, as cheesy and as offensive as Phil Collins is, the man could craft a pop tune.Blessed with a McCartney-esque gene, Collins was able to write a little ditty, cover someone else's, and make it snappy and listenable. Granted, he had the same formula, the same instrumentation, the obsession with horn hits, vocal distortion to hide what I suspect is a weak voice, and a drum machine (though he was lauded as a drummer) but he put it together often enough and people bought it.Eventually, the formula wore out, but not before Collins pocketed half a billion bucks and moved to Switzerland, he an unabashed Tory.The disc should take care of any Collins fixation you might have. The more seriously afflicted will check out his full solo albums for a full dosage of horn hits."
1,Not even worth the 99c.,"Bought it, hated it, regretted even 99c on it. Don't waste your money. I've never regretted a decision more in my entire life."
2,Bubblegum hits,"First I must admit that it's my fault for not checking the song titles on this CD. If I were to create a best of or hits, I wouldn't have picked any of the songs on here. I'm not very good about knowing song titles and I should have spent some time checking these first. It has love songs and bubblegum hits, it's going in the garbage."
5,EXCELLENT HITS,I saw Phil Collins on the A&E channel this past weekend on the Live on Request concert and what an excellent performer. The songs he performed are all on this CD. I will definitely purchase it.
4,I hate Phil Collins...NOT!,"Once upon a time, I bought this album years after I digged listening to his Serious Hits album. The songs featured on Serious Hits Live are performed to a great extent without faltering. Of course, I'm not a die-hard Phil Collins fanatic, but knowing that he can play a whole truckload of instruments forced me to get this album, since I already liked a number of the songs on here prior to purchase. As for those who hate Phil, they hardly know what they're talking about if they HAVE heard his music. Only flaw on this album is the too bouncy ""Dance Into The Light."""
4,Phil Collins...HIts,This album is really smooth. It can be played all day long. It's too good. Definitely a successful purchase. I am very happy with the purchase that I made.
4,"Good short collection but he deserves a bigger, more coherent, solo anthology","Phil Collins / Hits: As a single disc collection of Phil Collin's hits, this is just fine. However, the short nature of this CD limits the appreciation that the artist deserves. Mr. Collins deserves a better anthology.This one is good but I don't love it...Four Stars"
3,Phil Collins,"Some songs are good, but some I don't like that much. In general some of the songs are my old favourites."
4,"Simply...is Phil, and is great.","I am not a Huge Phil Collins fan but i do like the man, not only as a singer but also as a composer, the guy is a great musician. This cd is really good when you have not a lot of space in your glove compartment for more discs and you want Phil to sound loud as you cruise around, or simply to relax back home. Is great music, full of musicianship and soul, recommended."
5,Phil Collins is the man!,"I think Phil Collins tonality, his music and approach to music is unique, and of course nostalgic for me as well. In terms of his genre, I truly believe Phil Collins is a legend."
4,great music,"this was a wishlist item for one of my son-in-laws. It was a great choice, I love Phil Collins' music."
5,Great collection of songs!,"WOW! Hot dang diggity dog! I haven't been this excited about a CD since I found the ""Eagles Greatest Hits"" The new ""Phil Collins ....Hits"" will blow you over!He will take you from the 60's with the remake of ""You Can't Hurry Love"" by the Supremes to the last decade with the sultry pouty sexy ""In the Air Tonight"" to his new release of Another Day in Paradise. Atlantic Recording has finally released something that people between the ages of 38-58 will just LOVE!"
4,Greatest hits...need I say more?,"New cd, in packaging. All great songs. I knew what I wanted and thats what arrived. YAY! I only wish it was a box set, as there are even a couple more songs Id have liked to have!"
5,He finally made a Greatest Hits!,"This album is, plain and simple, some of Phil Collins' greatest songs. What really makes this CD worth it is the studio version of ""Easy Lover"" which was only ever on a very obscure album (at least I've never heard of it!) called ""Chinese Wall."" Although there are some songs on the album ""But Seriously..."" that I liked more than some of the ones on this one, I still loved more than two-thirds of the songs on here. A must have for all Phil Collins fans."
5,The best if you want to dance and to dream away,"I have this album only two days and i'm completely adicted to it. I'm really in love with the slow numbers, like true colors and agains all odds. This CD will be liked very much by teenagers, they all know Phil and his numbers. I got the feeling there is one really good song missing, but I can't remember which. All listeners of relaxed music and like Collins, must really buy this album, you won't regret it."
2,Not What I Expected,"I Love Phil Collins, I just had no idea that my favorite songs of his were live performances on this album. I prefer studio done stuff. Was just dissatisfied because of this."
4,Terrific representation of Phil's greatest works,"I really love this cd. I play it over and over, especially ""Easy Lover"" ""Against All Odds"" and ""one More night"". Its a great collection for the nostalgic fans from the 80s. I agree that ""Do you remember"" should have been included, and there were a few songs on here that didn't quite fit like ""Both sides of the story"". But it is worth the investment."
5,Phil Collins Hits another one out of the ballpark!,Its a good thing that you can't wear out a CD from playing it too much! I can't get enough! Master Phil is a percussionist deluxe and this collection of his greatest lend themselves to his genius. His rendition of True Colors is the best I've heard. I Wish It Would Rain Down tugs at my heart. The background vocals and orchestral arrangements are magnificent. This one lends itself to listening with headphones to catch every nuance of the arrangements. Thanks Phil!
5,Love! Love! Love! Lovveeeeee this compilation!,"HITS!....a wonderfully compiled album that contains all the songs that truly matter(well except 1 or 2 such as ""do you remember"" and ""i missed again"")...So much that it doesn't even need a qualifier such as ""greatest"" or something equally descriptive.I cannot even begin to rank any of these classics in any order of preference...that would an absolute undecisive mess! From the chart topping cover of Cindy Lauper's ""true colors"" and mellow ballads such as ""Separate lives"" and ""I wish it would rain down"", to the funky-ness of ""Sussudio"", this album has it all. Collins' musical genuis is well apparent. ""Hits"" is a mere reminder of how truly gifted he is as a musician...he sings(amazingly) and drums(wonderfully too)...he rocks! simply put."
4,It's good,"Yeah, there's good stuff here. I'm sure the hardest thing to do was whittle the tracks down to this few. I didn't buy it (gasp!) because with the exception of ""True Colors"", all of these songs were on previous CDs...and with the advent of CD burners, you could easily make your own.The discussions of what the track listing 'should have been', just like talking about what songs MIGHT be played IF there was a Genesis reunion crack me up.But rest assured, there WILL be a Phil Collins box set in the near future. Now that will be worth owning!"
5,Great Tunes,Heard this was very popular again and bought it. Really brought back some good times. Phil is just great. I also like No Jacket Required. If you like Phil you will like this one.
5,Collins at his BEST,"This is Phil Collins at his BEST!! Just LOVE the CD; crisp, clean and always HOT! If Collins is your kind of guy, you gotta hear this."
4,Love it,Phil Collins has always been one of my favorite singers since the eighties and to have all his hits on one CD is what I really wanted.
2,Rehashing a rehash...sort of,"Phil Collins used to be one of my favorite artists. Somewhere in between ""No Jacket Required"" and ""But Seriously"" he lost me. ""But Seriously"" was one of the worst, if not THE worst, Collins album. ""Serious Hits Live"" was great, but why do we need yet another greatest hits album featuring basically the same songs? How about something new? I mean, ""True Colors"" is a nice song, but all I can think about when I hear it is that Whitney Houston AT&T commercial. (I think it's AT&T) I won't be investing my money on this album. I'm glad I listened to it at someone else's house first."
3,How could they leave off Do You Remember,"I'm a quite bit disappointed with this disc. It left off a few hits such as; Do You Remember, Everyday, I Don't Care Anymore - the continuation of In The Air Tonight, Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away, and Why Can't It Wait 'Till Morning."
3,some songs hold up other's don't,i wish i missed again had made the cut.had to say that.he had some great songs in the 80's like susidio the 1999 soundalike and others.i enjoy his drumming and he has written some good songs.but to often than not many don't stand the test of time.and with the exception of some many seem dated and time-period songs that probably wouldn't fly in any other era.the man has talent like on in the air tonight but i don't think this set best show-cases it.
2,"I love Phil Collins, but ...","I am a huge fan of Phil Collins, however, this album does not include three of my favorite hits of his from the 80s: ""Everyday"", ""Do You Remember?"" and ""Don't Lose My Number"". Instead of including these they made room for songs like ""True Colors"" (which was appopriate for Cyndi Lauper, not Phil Collins) and ""Dance Into the Light"" which was a minor 90s hit that does not merit a spot on this album. Although there are some great hits here, this album is very incomplete."
3,"Seriously, Phil!","I absolutely love most of Genesis' music. Together, Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford did splendid things. Apart from Genesis, though, Phil's skills wane considerably. The solo gig may be more profitable, and there's nothing wrong with that. But when I listen to my Genesis CDs, like A Trick of the Tail, or the more recent Genesis, Invisible Touch, and We Can't Dance, I hear music that takes me places Phil alone can never hope for. You throbbing hearts out there keep on idolizing, but you--as well as Phil Collins--are settling for something far less than what we could enjoy if Genesis could reunite!"
5,"""True Colors,"" the greatest remake ever","I usually hate remakes,but Phil Collins remake of ""True Colors"" is one of the most beutifull songs I've heard in ages.The harmony is perfection.My other favorites from this collection are ""Two Hearts,"" and ""Easy Lover."" This is my first Phil Collins album.I always loved his Music,but never thought about buying his records untill I heard ""True Colors."""
4,Not a bad recap of a few decades of hits...,"Phil Collins' fans will agree, we spent the last two decades loving his stuff. His voice was as much a part of rock stations as it was pop. Most everything he does is catchy and memorable, be it a love song, a dance hit or a ""message"" song. Though missing a few really good songs, this CD is a must for Phil fans and makes a good gift for under the Christmas tree too!"
5,loved it,this phil collins cd was such catchy and made my family be calm and wonderful. thanks for selling this wonderful CD
4,Going down memory lane,"I happened to see this greatest hits album by accident -- I wasn't looking for a Phil Collins album. But when I saw the song list, and I listened to the teaser clips, I decided what the heck! A lot of good songs from the 80's that brought back many good memories for me. A whim buy for sure, and how can you go wrong for $5?"
4,Great memory music,Nice vinyl collection at a great price. Collins' voice takes me right back! What a bargain! Highly recommend if you remember too.
5,Good tunes,"A really good collection. Unlike many greatest hits collections, this one actually has all good songs by Collins, not just some B-side rarely heard tracks."
5,Phil Collins Hits,"A must get cd great music.. Love Phil Collins work, anyone who liked miami vice some of the songs in that show are in this albumn....."
1,Don't buy this,"The item shown is a baitcasting rod, the one that was sent to me was a spincasting rod. I have been trying to contact the seller to have my order corrected and have received very limited replies. I suggest that until the seller corrects their inventory and/or listing that you avoid buying this fishing rod and dealing with this seller. The seller also needs to work on customer problem resolution!The Shakespeare Catfish casting rod, both the baitcasting and spincasting rods, are heavy duty, and able to handle catfish over 40 pounds. I have about 10 of these rods in my collection and I use them all the time. I wanted to buy a couple of new ones to give as gifts to my twin daughters for Christmas, paired with Ambassadeur 6500 reels."
1,Unsatisfactory,"Although this player is conveniently small and compact, it seems susceptible to internal malfunction. I had problems loading perfectly playable files when I first used it. I've had problems with its functionality as a disk, recieving error messages when attempting to load or remove files using my pc. Essentially, its convenience and flexibility with file loading and manipulation is nonexistent.After a couple days I finally loaded the songs I wanted. About 20-30 days later a file-overwhelming, screeching sound (like the weather service test on TV) pierced my ears when listening to files.I sent an email to their tech support a good while back and still no response.Maybe its just the player that I got...who knows...but if your willing to try your luck with this product, I guess thats your choice."
5,Excellent for me!,I bought this after thoroughly researching other flash players. I like that this has a lot of features for the price. I use it at the gym and at home and it works perfectly for me. Putting songs on it is very easy and you can fit enough songs to get by for a quite a while (WMA format). Two things I don't like: having to charge via USB (although I am going to buy the wall charger) and having to sit there and hold down the power button to turn on or off.Overall I'm very glad I got this player and would recommend it to anyone who needs a good flash player and likes to keep things fun and easy.
1,"ok for 5 mos, then died, NO cust support","i initally bought this player for the size and price, and i was very pleased for about 5 months, but suddenly my computer would not recognize it. apparently, from reading a few blogs, its a common prob., and when i tried calling mobiblu's toll free number for cust. service, the inbox was full. sure, the 1 year warranty is good on paper, but good luck trying to claim it. BUYER BEWARE~!!!"
1,Frustrating,"I purchased a Mobiblu DAH-1500i last Christmas for my daughter. It arrived promptly and looked great. We loaded on some MP3s that we had and bought a few more through the Walmart online music store. All seemed to go smoothly. However, a few weeks later, several songs that had been loaded would not play. We tried resetting and reloading loading everything and still could not get 100% working. I have repeatedly emailed the tech support, once in March, again in May and again over the summer. Never received a response. I have tried updating the firmware but for some reason, that has been unresponsive on my system. Also the headphones broke not long after we purchased it. I would not recommend buying this."
1,Bad Product,"While the size and design are very innovative, the functionality is non-existant. The waste of money will not play ANY LEGALLY OWNED music downloads. I tried several different file types, but the only files that will work are some old MP3s that I had before Napster was declared illegal. This thing is a joke and the info on their website is not helpful. They do not answer the phone or answer email. I have been RIPPED OFF!!!"
3,Another good one!,"Another good book on Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Jack Rackham. I think I finished this book in 4 days. Didn't want to put it down. The author really brought the characters to life and did it well. Will always make me wonder as to what happened to Anne Bonny. What really happened to her and how her days ended. Good book, I recommend it."
4,"Calico Jack, Ann and Mary","If you like pirate stories, this is the book for you. Fictionalized history but very informative. Will read more books by this author."
5,Fascinating Read!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. The subject matter was gripping -- women pirates and how they got to be pirates! I thought the characterizations were excellent and felt myself really caring about these people. I feel James Nelson did a masterful job telling this fascinating story, and it was so realistically done that I really felt I was there watching everything. I highly recommend it -- definitely different, eminently interesting! Kudos to James L. Nelson -- a wonderful story teller!!"
4,Mary and Anne would be proud,"I think that James L. Nelson did a really well job. I realize how hard it is to write about people that so little is known about.It is a fairly long book, but once you get into it, you'll fall in love with the words and characters. It gave such an insight into the female women's minds, as well as calico jack rackman.Read it, just read it"
2,The only thing I liked was the cover.,"The only thing I really liked about this book was the cover. I found it interesting (from another review) that this is actually an older book redone under the true author's name (Formally it was under a fake, female name.). The description and the cover promise more than what is delivered in this novel."
1,Do not waste your money,"I have only read 34 pages of ""The Only Life That Mattered"", but my life matters too much to me to read any more. How this author has ten books in print is beyond my comprehension; both he and his editor(s) should be strung up by their thumbs. It's not just bad writing, it's lazy writing. There are numerous sentence fragments. There are factual inaccuracies. Sentences, even paragraphs, are started with ""And"" and ""But"". I could go on and on, but it is not worth my time. I have made corrections and will send the book to the publisher; I do not wish to have it in my home."
4,You may have already read this!,"Just a word of warning before you purchase this book. It was published a couple of years ago under the title of ""The Sweet Trade"" and the author was Elizabeth Garrett. I made the mistake of purchasing it only to discover I had already read it!"
3,"Book ""review""","Actually, I never read this book, I ordered it for a friend. Anyway, it arrived promptly, and in excellent condition, and at a very reasonable price. If I need a book sometime I will definitly look for it at Amazon.Don Maffitt"
3,"Good information at the end, but way too long","This book was easily 200 pages too long, provided way too much detail about superfluous information like the type of van the Reeds drove etc. The title also suggests that the book is mainly about Clinton's & Bush's involvement in some shady dealings; it is tangentially about those and a good chunk is dedicated to Clinton's efforts to get back at Reed, but the book is mainly about Terry Reed and HIS involvement in those operations. Not that that's a bad thing, but I don't think it's worth 682 pages. I would've liked more evidence on the drug smuggling, Reed only has ""proof"" of one shipment. I don't doubt that there could have been (and probably was) a CIA conspiracy, but Reed hasn't proved so beyond a reasonable doubt. All in all, though, fairly entertaining and informative."
4,"The Most Important, Tediously Written Text Since Constitutio","Though a good editing job would have been more to the point, one benefits from the detail if one is interested in the reality of our intelligence world. This book comes very, very close to substantiating the most cynical assessment of our degenerate government. It only misses on one accord, that the central skew of our heavily connected mass media will never present these fact to a largely ignorant public who still think George Bush and Bill Clinton have different morals. If nothing else, it will make you want to vote. But for whom?"
4,Mr. Reed nails it between the uprights!,I still have a cassette tape of Mr.Reed on Dr. Stan's fine Radio Libertyshow discussing how the alphabet souplettered agencies came at him withboth barrels blazing under the overusedguies of (get this!) 'National Security.'Get this book Mr. & Mrs. America!!!!!!
3,A Little Disappointing,"The description of Paul's love interest started my downhill opinion of The Attorney. Mr. Martini seemed to be describing a Barbie Doll, not a real woman. I read the description, looked at the back cover picture of the author and thought ""Yes, this is his fantasy woman""From that place in the book until the end I was sceptical and disappointed in the way he laid out his plot and characters."
3,The ending blew it.,"I have read all the series. Like the writing and characters. The Attorny had me for a while. Then it got too predictable. You know what is going to happen before you read. I was ok with that, it still made for a good read.Then he blew it. He gave us an ending that was too much to believe. I like surprises but there has to be some hint in the book before the ending. With this one, there is no inkling of who the actual killer is. (Don't worry I won' t reveal it). It just drops out of the air. It really makes no sense.So I can't recommend buying this one. Do what I did. Get it from the library. Enjoy an easy read. Then get ready to say ""What the hell????"" at the end."
3,The Attorney,"This is the second Paul Madriani series book I've read. It's a fast read, not totally predictable, but not totally exciting either."
3,This is definitely NOT his best...,"First off let me say I really like the lead character, Paul Madriani and I've read most of this series, but this book - the Attorney - rambles and rambles... you keep wanting to say 'ok, I get it, get ON with it' PLUS there are too many times you absolutely KNOW what is coming but he just HAS to add another 4 or 5 or 10 pages before we get there. Painfully slow in spots. Lots of areas where you say 'huh?' like when he leaves his daughter with his girlfriend (a working professional too) for weeks at a time and he is very surprised when she tells him he has not even seen his daughter in over a week. This author definitely has no experience with single parenting! I did not see the twist ending coming and that was pretty good... I think if 1/2 the book had been edited out - all the tedious step-by-step-by-step of finding this clue and that clue - it would have been a really good book."
1,Somebody tell me if I'm missing something here.,O.K. Then how did the first cigar end up at the scene of the crime? And how did the Marlin scales from the same Marlin end up on the clothes of Suade?
2,Plods too Much in the Middle,"I've enjoyed Steve Martini's work in the past, but THE ATTORNEY was something of a disappointment.THE ATTORNEY has a great beginning, but the middle moves with almost excruciating slowness, with a lot of legal maneuvering and protracted arguments over minutae. There isn't a lot of tension in this novel, and I didn't feel a burning desire to turn the page. The trial in the second half of the novel is largely boring, where paper-thin characters rehash all the events that took place earlier in the book. This book is probably a hundred pages longer than it needs to be.There is a twist ending in THE ATTORNEY, but it's delivered in a way that is kind of abrupt and unsatisfying. I can't say more without giving it away.I like Martini's writing style, and really enjoyed his novel DOUBLE TAP, so I hope this book is an aberration."
3,Not Martini's Best,"Paul Madriani, once again does double duty as lawyer/sleuth. He has moved to San Diego to be near his lady love. There he meets an elderly man with an only child, a long time drug addict. The drug addicted daughter has an eight year old daughter that the old man and his wife have been raising. A recipe for trouble follows: The old man wins the state lottery, his daughter returns from jail wanting her daughter back, and a feminist activitist with a talent for making children and their ""victimized"" mothers disappear arrives making threats.The plotting of this novel is fairly predictable. The ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered. There are no stunning revelations and the climax is anti-climactic."
4,wonderful legal thriller,"I hadn't read many of his books and was really pleased when I read this one. Mandriani is an attorney and one of his clients, who he had defended before with good results, comes to him again. Jonah Hale, who has since won one of the biggest lotteries, wants Mandriani to find his grand-daughter who has been kidnapped by his daughter, a drug user and released felon. The woman who he feels helped his daughter with the kidnapping ends up murdered and he is accused of the murder. Mandriani has his hands full trying to keep up with all the different angles and suspects. The ending may surprise you. I enjoyed the book and I think you will too. I am looking forward to reading another of his books."
2,Killer revealed early,"I love the Steve Martini novels. Normally I'm always guessing until the end. In this one it was obvious early on ""who done it""."
1,Don't Bother!,"I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this book . Oh yes! The fact that the cover stated that ""the suspense is excruciating"" or on the back of the book stating that the story is ""riveting."" I was very very disappointed to say the least. I was halfway through the book waiting for something exciting to happen. Plus the ending was a major letdown. I would NOT recommend this book."
3,What a disappointment...,"For the return of Paul Madriani, I guess I was expecting a lot more. I also figured out the whodunnit very early on, so I was bored to tears waiting for the ending. Mr. Martini is starting to remind me of Grisham, Patterson, etc. Turning out books with very little character/storyline development. It's sad to see..."
2,A well routed novel,"This was the first I had read of his books and I thought it was okay: it had a well planned plot and was written stylishly, but it lacked the pizazz I was looking for at the moment. The beginning built up and gave you the impression of a firework ending, but the climaz was so subtle that I almost missed it."
2,Such a let down from past work...,"I hope Martini doesn't turn into one of those best selling novelists who begins to believe his own publicity and lets his storytelling slide.This book is not representative of the fine work that Martini has done in the past. It's almost like he had to slap a plot together but couldn't decide which way to go, so he ended up all over the map. And Mexico? What's up with that?I'm glad Madrini's moved south...the change seems to suit him. Maybe Martini will conjure up a better story the next time.This book isn't bad enough to keep me from reading more Martini...I'll just be a little less enthusiatic for a while."
2,The gratuitous cigar butt,"My husband and I were enjoying this audio book while driving, but we ended up being disappointed because there is an element that makes no sense: the emptied out car ashtray that accuses JOnah Hale. Mr. Martini - we are paying attention. don't throw in stuff that doesn't work. Otherwise, well written and involving."
1,A major disappointment!,"I have adored Steve Martini's books, and have read all of them. Until now. I waited with eager anticipation for this newest book. I was bored to tears with it. I couldn't even finish it. I read about three quarters of it and gave up. What happened to him?"
4,Never Had a Clue!,"The Attorney is a story that will keep you interested from page 1 until ""the end"". The characters are interesting and diversified. The dialogue is crisp and realistic. And the author constantly keeps the reader wondering whether the defendant could really be guilty. The way in which Steve Martini weaves the tale and carries us along his path to the final ""shocking"" conclusion makes for very entertaining reading. I was gripped all along and while I sometimes enjoy reading a book only to be disappointed at the end...in The Attorney I was totally satisfied to the very last word. It's a MUST READ!"
3,Weak Ending,"Martini lays the groundwork for a good story, but too many loose ends and conflicting plot lines make for an extremely weak an unsatisfying ending. A good editor should have caught this before it went to press."
4,"An OK book, a great screenplay","Martini's book is very well wriiten Madriani is a lawyer you just like and the courtroom drama is written with flair. Although Martini tends to make his protagonist a little too super-human: the car chases, Mexican Gang-land fights, over-the-top PI's are perhaps the result of too many action movies but it does all works well, a true triller. Suspend reality just a notch and enjoy. It's just a book after all, right."
1,phoned it in?,"I have read virtually everything that Mr. Martini has produced. His earlier stuff was good to very good, but, here, I get the feeling that he was writing just to fulfill a publishing contract or something. This is not his best work, and I had the feeling that he just, to use that overworked phrase, 'phoned it in.' He has great potential, but he just does not live up to it here. Take no offense, sir. I quit reading John Grisham for the same reason. All 'pop,' no 'culture.'"
3,Page-turner and Peeker-friendly,"Steve Martini's novel usually not at the top at the bestseller's list but he has his own charm that knock John Grisham's witty bestsellers down. Martini is somehow lacking good sense of humor thus his novels are only suitable to those really into courtroom thriller. And to others, stick with Grisham's highly commerciallized and a little not realistic novels.This wuddunnit is amazingly written and stunning ending.The novelist succeeded to confuse readers from the beginning and pushing more and more to blame the likeliest suspect until the very end he turn it completely different (not opposite). While the conclusion is really suprisingly great, it's also simple and peeker-friendly. To enjoy this book please do not peek the last few pages!"
1,Tossed the book away after only a few pages,The sensible thing to do was grab the child and move to another state! Staying put was silly masochism. What could I expect of this novel after such a start?
3,Good Read Up To The End,"This is the first time I have read Steve martini's work. It kept me on my toes trying to figure out what was going to happen next. It had alot of strange twists. I really enjoyed reading this book. However, the ending result of the novel could have been better. Overall, a good legal thriller."
1,Aweful! I couldn't finish it.,"I have always loved Martini's books - and his character, Madriani - so I was eagerly awaiting this new one. Have I been missing something? In the hiatus between Martini's published works I've been reading Elizabeth George, Michael Connelly, Scott Turow, Ruth Rendell, Elizabeth Peters . . . and wow, does Martini come off as shallow and gender-biased by comparison (well, not with Peters, but thats all tongue-in-cheek anyway!) Why does every woman of worth have to be perfectly cotoured, tall, slender, muscle-bound,...? Why does the hero have to be SO very stereotypical? I felt like I was reading the script for a B-grade TV movie! All I can be thankful for is that I did not buy this book, but checked it out of the library!"
2,Boring,"I read over half, started skipping pages & decided not worth the time. Cannot believe it is Martini, no suspense, drawn out courtroom dialogue, slow moving. Twisted plots not even exciting."
5,Good looking whisk,"This is a mid-size whisk, not a full-size one. If you understand that you'll be happy with it. It is a simple item, does what it is supposed to, and looks great doing it."
4,Good Whisk,"This whisk is good. What can you really say about a whisk. It is of decent quality and I like the feel of it. It does well with eggs, pancakes, whatever and I like it. I handwash and it is easy to clean. Great buy."
2,VERY SMALL IN SIZE,"Although solidly made, this is a VERY SMALL whisk. Nine inches sounds big, but this will only suffice for whisking 2-3 eggs, or for those occasions when you don't want a full sized whisk. I was disappointed in it when it arrived. It's not what you want if you think it's a regular sized whisk."
2,Silent but deadly dull,"I feel like a bit of a Philistine for not appreciating this silent German comedy more. Despite many interesting visual flairs, such as the inventive set designs and the use of offbeat framing techniques, I couldn't see it as anything more than a very slight, silly story that went on far longer than it needed to. It failed the most fundamental test for any comedy: I did not crack a smile even once."
5,Toy ball used for abdominal excercise,"This is a real cheap alternative to the ""bender ball.""It's brightly colored, which seems to be a plus, and durable.I would compare the educational value of this toy to that of a brick, though this product is clearly more child friendly.The ball inflates easily and stays inflated. A pretty simple product that does its job well."
2,Returns not accepted?,We ordered the wrong size of battery for our surge protector and the new item is about double the size of what we wanted. I realize that this is a mistake of my own for buying the wrong product but we haven't used the battery and we have all of the material that was shipped with the battery.We would really appreciate an ability to return the battery and receive a refund. If it is not possible to return the product by shipment then could give us a list of stores that might buy the product back? Thank you.- Robert
5,Battery Replacement,"After 8 years of wonderful service protecting my wife's PC and on numerous occasions providing her the time necessary to save her work prior to her UPS running down, I finally needed to replace the battery for the UPS and ordered a replacement from Amazon that arrived two days later. I replaced the old battery with the new and I expect about 8 more years of wonderful service for her UPS. I highly recommend APC for their UPS products. Thanks!!"
5,Exact replacement,This is the exact replacement of the factory original battery. Easily installs and works great. Be sure to dispose of the old battery properly. Take it to one of those big box hardware stores.
3,IT'S A BATTERY,"Yeah, it's a battery that works. Way overpriced. I'm sure they have higher quality control then a generic make but come on. It's priced like ink for printers. No idea where it's made because it's not labeled. Allica at APC told me that one of their main manufacturers for this battery is in the Phillipines. Great now we're making lead acid batteries overseas too. With the weight of these puppies shipping must cost more than payroll. Buy American or be happy with $8 an hour pay."
1,DO NOT BUY APC PRODUCTS,"I replaced my older APC Backup with a new bigger one. I had over 40 minutes backup time to shut down with my old one. With the new one, I only had 6 minutes. Took it back and got another one, with the same results - Only 6 minutes!So I bought a this new battery and guess what? ONLY 6 MINUTES. They must be making the batteries differently and yes it is the right one. Same numbers and size (APC RBC17).They have taking out a lot of backup time that I would use in a blackout.I would never buy an APC product again...."
2,Returned immediately - sort of,"There may not be anything wrong with this company's batteries - even though the picture on Amazon and the actual battery sent was different - but it did not work for me as a replacement for my APC UPS. They told me I had to ""recalibrate"" my UPS to match their battery - a tedious seven step process that was a pain. However, they did ultimately refund the full amount and for that I give them 2 stars."
2,One year lifetime,"I bought this APC RBC17 replacement through Amazon and it stopped working after 12 months plus a few days of use. The original APC battery lasted 4 years. I've had better experience with non-OEM UPS batteries, with lifetimes varying from two to five years. Given the higher cost of the OEM battery, I expected the battery to last at least as long as APC says at the low end (""Expected Battery Life (years) 3 - 5""). It did work during the warranted one year period, (powering my computers during a few small power outages and one longer than an hour) which is why I'm not rating this it only one star."
5,Powered Up,"I received my replacement APC RBC17 battery within a couple of days of placing the order even though I didn't request any special delivery! The battery came with easy to understand installation instructions and I was powered up within minutes of opening the package. And after checking several places on the cost of this OEM replacement battery, the price was lower than average."
1,Dead after 5 months,"My original APC battery lasted over 5 years. This replacement is now apparently dying after 5 months.Guess I'll buy a NON APC UPS. Apparently they no longer make products you can trust. Sad, I was a happy customer who had recommended their products regularly."
4,"Hey, it's a battery.","Not much to say, really. It's a battery. However, the package was terrible. The outer carton was fine, but the inner box that actually held the battery had clearly been opened. The battery was dirty and even had grass (!) inside the box. I have never received something from Amazon that was so poorly packaged."
1,Died 1 year after I purchased it.,"I bought this to replace the battery on my APC Back-UPS LS 700. I don't have any unusual service demands for the UPS. It's plugged in all the time and I use it for my computer equipment. My printer is plugged into the printer socket on the UPS. The original battery lasted 3 years, but the replacement died 2 days after the 1 year warranty expired. This battery is suppose to go 3-5 years when it's used in ""float"" (always plugged in) service. I'm going to try an off-brand replacement battery this time which has a 2 year warranty."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do - nothing less and nothing more ...,"The APC replacement battery (first replacement after 9 years of use!) for my ""Back UPS ES 725 VA Broadband"" that I received today from Amazon.com was indeed a genuine APC replacement cartridge as pictured on the Web Site.The battery cartridge fits my UPS perfectly. It was not an ""off-brand"" replacement battery that some earlier reviewers apparently were unexpectedly sent and about which they should justifiably complain.For me UPS happiness was a simple thing: I unplugged the UPS, slid open the battery cover on the back of the unit, disconnected and replaced/reconnected the new battery. I was back in business within a few minutes time.This is a quality product at a good price, especially with Amazon Prime 2-day shipping; Amazon even got it to me in just one business day.If this is the battery that you seek, do not hesitate to purchase one here and you too will be experiencing UPS happiness before you know it!"
4,Replacement Not exact but close enough...,"The Photo does NOT show the actual Replacement battery received. The APC Battery shown in the Photo sells for approx $ 40.00 from APC and has a different Amp Hour Rating, 9.0 AH versus the 7.2 AH in the repacement battery! Both are 12 Volt Sealed Lead-Acid Batteries. Both have the same dimentions physically. The Replacement seems to work fine and I tested it to have almost the same Emergency Up time before shut down as the Original APC Battery. I would recomend this to anyone interested in saving money. Granted the replacement is not an exact duplicate, but it is close enough. Another Great Amazon Purchase!"
4,Replacement Battery,What's to say the old battery went bad and this site had the best price on a MFG (not a knockoff) battery.
3,better products out there,"As a basic structure, this thing works at best OK. Nuts and bolts fall away easily, instructions are poor, and it needs a lot of love to be worth using a lot. Get a couple of tree stands and you'll be better serviced."
2,Not a,"When Callie's (Vinessa Shaw) mom goes to London on business, the self-absorbed citified teen is sent to Utah's Coyote Arrow Ranch to spend the summer. There she meets a young Indian ranch hand named Rafe (Adam Beach), and Kyla, a wild horse who presents a challenge. Callie decides to train the spooky stud for barrel racing, and enters him in a big show at the annual fair. Over the eventful summer, Callie learns the importance of responsibility and what it's like to care for someone other than herself. Nothing new, but not a bad kids' movie.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,A barrel racing purebred Fresian? Yeah- right!,"I could not get into this movie because of the obvious inaccuracies. They use a purebred Fresian because it's beautiful, well & good. But where's the sire & dam? The other horses on the farm are quarter horses, as well they should be. The way they tried to ""train"" him without ground work- trying to throw a saddle over his back, well, duh! He's gonna spook & run away. I thought that Indian kid was supposed to know what he was doing. And ""training"" him the first 30 days with a running martingale? Priceless. Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh! I'm still gritting my teeth!"
5,coyote summer dvd from sue terry books,"i ordered this dvd from sue terry books on amazon and received it 3 days later in perfect condition! The seller even updated via e-mail letting me know when it was sent and to write with any questions or concerns, very helpful and friendly!!!!!! would recommend them to anyone!"
2,Not much cotton,The wooden sticks on these swabs break frequently. There is not much cotton on the tip. The 6 inch version work much better.COTTON APPLICATORS PURITAN NON STERILE 6'' 100/PKG
2,Seizure inducing...,"...and that's a bad thing. The strobe-like editing makes it impossible to actually see any of the performances, and the silly banter between tracks is dreadfully dull. Then, when the music gets really good, they cut back and forth to the claymation, which would be cool if you could actually focus on it. Not only that, but the claymation has its own sound effects which drown out the awesome music. I wish someone would go back into the ""dub-room"" and unmix this thing so we can see actually see (and hear) the performances. The best parts are the few nano seconds we get to see Ruth Underwood do her thing."
3,Don't expect too much,"Ok after reading the other reviewers I can see that I am not alone when I say that this DVD is not very good- is it worth the $12? Yes, I would buy it again given the choice but it is still disappointing. Zappa himself was obviously enamoured of the claymation process and I also think that it is really neato but for God's sake put the claymation sequences at the very end of the DVD and not RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOODY GUITAR SOLO!Anyway, I feel better now. Go ahead & get this if you have not yet purchased it- the live shots are worth putting up with the pap."
2,All or nothing... not some of 3...,"I love Zappa. I've read nearly every book on him and seen almost all material available to the free world.I have to tell you, this DVD stinks.They've taken two awesome concerts, chopped them up with some scenes from ""Baby Snakes"", and called it a ""concert video"". Now, I know that Zappa ain't the kind to just put out something normal. That wouldn't be fitting. But come on! I'd rather have a DVD of the 1974 concert, the Halloween concert, and ""Baby Snakes"".If you are a REAL Zappa fan, you will buy this and have a brief chuckle over the zany antics at Compact Video. Then, you will become extremely frustrated with the concert footage.I suggest you buy it anyway, to complete your collection. Then go buy ""Does Humour Belong in Music?"" and ""Baby Snakes"". Hey, the price is right!"
4,Noise effects. Why? Why?,"As somenone who owns Baby Snakes and has endured one too many times Bruce Bickford's artistry, I thought it was a crime to include it also right where Frank commence's one of his most famous solos (Inca Roads). But it was genocide to additionally include those annoying sound effects. As I'm sure is the case with felow Zappa fans, we're constantly on the lookout for releases of live performances from Zappa's greatest band (the rock n' roll equivalent to Duke Ellington's Blanton-Webster band): Duke-Underwood-Fowler-Thompson-Murphy Brock. After nearly 32 years, we're offered this gift to mankind, marred with this crap. Not fair."
4,Hillariously Cool,"I've been a Zappa fan for some time now, but only recently have I been purchasing the videos he produced.This one was one of the tamer videos out, although it's still funny and entertaining. It gives you an inside look at his creative process, along with some straight forward performances with the group of muzishnins that he created some of his finest compositions. It seems that the times that he was touring with Ruth Underwood, George Duke, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Tom Fowler, and Chester Thompson, (and Marty Perellis as the gorilla), he had the most fun. I have a recording of FZ with that band in Harrisburg, PA circa '74, and he always seemed to be enjoying himself.There are other more recent performances from NYC in '81, that are amazing as well, plus some claymation from Bruce Bickford.All in all a very cool video."
4,Zappa,I love the live footage from the '74 show. The band then was just fantastic. The '82 is amazing too but the 8os synth sound just bugs me. I guess you couldn't really get away from it back then though...ha. There is cool footage of claymation that happens during some of the live stuff. The only thing that is kind of a bummer is that the sound effects accompanying the claymation happens during the music...it really takes away from the music.
4,Add this to your collection,"If you are a fan,just get it.You will not be disappointed.The video of 70's band is worth the price alone.Less than 15 dollars!How can you go wrong?"
4,Hal lil loo ya. I can't spell :(,Until I bought this disk a year or two ago I tought that nothing could top the original Lust. I was wrong. Also including several different versions of Glory that are all great especially the cajun-dub. There is a metalized version of Move On that sounds like it was done in the same recording session as Agogo's Hole in the Wall. This version of Trust far outmatches the one on Nihil. A must have for Kmfdm fans and collectors of their singles.
1,Cannell mailed this one in...,Far & away the worst of all his books. Boring story with characters you could care less about. Would have been better off re-reading King Con.
1,Total predictable crap,"OK, was the first review written by a publisher's flunky or what? You'd think with the MILLIONS Of dollars corps. spend in promotion they'd be smart enough to NOT write total marketing blather.I got ahold of an advance reader's copy of this book by pure chance in an airport-- undoubtedly some poor reviewer had left it behind in order to go be airsick-- and would like to say it is a boring, utterly predictable, and cliche-ridden piece of hooey. Thank you very much."
2,A Whole Lot of Moving,"As I finished this novel (it is a novel, it's part of the title) I was struck by how many times the author ""moved"" his characters. These characters never ran or walked, the always ""moved."" As in, Cris moved to the door. Not a big problem but after several hundred pages it became annoying.The story is ok, nothing special, more like a TV movie. The real problem is the timing. On one page Cannell says it is 8:30am and a bright crisp day and on the next page it is pitch black with dark clouds covering the moon. Later the evil folk outrun a train, on foot, and through mountains.So, if you can get past the moving and timing then the story is passable. Not award winning, but with some character changes it could have been an A-Team episode."
2,"Remarkably similar to ""World Order""","Devil's workshop is not only your typical government conspiracy novel, it is remarkably similar to ""World Order"" by Andrew Goliszek, a 1998 novel about all things: bioweaponry, ethnic cleansing, a scientist whose husband presumably committed suicide, a secret government project, an attempt to rid the world of certain ethnic groups! Did Cannell read Goliszek's book or is it all coincidence?"
1,Comic Book Cliche,"Sophomoric writing, passive voice that an English 101 student would thrive on (Cannell was was-wasing to death). Implausible characters doing implausible things at implausible times. I counted three occasions wherein Cannell had written himself into a dead-end impossiiity and skipped over the literary deadlock by the use of the word ""miraculously."" How cheap. The characters have the depth of a highly evaporated foot-rinse bucket, drawn in broad strokes. It's simply amazing that the military can vanquish Vanishing Lake without this little thing called radar picking up what's going on. The transparent attack on the history of bio weapons and nuclear weapons is time-worn, adding nothing, and over-simplified. Is there anyone who didn't know the ending with two-hundred pages to spare? The genre for Devil's Workshop is called comic book."
2,"Engaging,original,inspiring and astounding","What is so engaging about this book is the title. What is so original is the choice of characters: a female scientist,an ex-marine and a movie director. What is so inspiring about it, is that it makes me feel that even I can write a novel. But what is most astounding, is that it got published. Colorful language has never been one of my favorite traits in a novel, and it makes me wince when it comes from a ""feisty"" lady biologist. It seems to me that profanity is used in this novel as an attempt to keep the reader interested. I could very well just buy one of Jerry Springer uncensored tapes and have twice the fun for half the price. Again,it astounded me that this one book got published. Makes me want to write one myself"
2,Yoga in Chairs - Beginner,"I can't recommend this video as there are so many good ones on the market.While I feel these exercises have merit, to me, the title is misleading.The exercises are extremely mild with very slooow progression. I would say that this series would be better for people who are rehabilitating or partially disabled or quite elderly. You might argue that the phrase ""in Chairs"" would be enough explanation, but there are plenty of other yoga practices done in chairs that are entirely different.Unfortunately, the quality of the recording is poor. There is an echo to the words as though the room in which it was being recorded may have been large with high ceilings.The leader is dressed sloppily with little regard to the picture she presents to the viewer. At first not knowing anything about the yoga practitioner or his/her program, the viewer will receive his/her impressions (healthy, caring, happy) by what they see. The indication here is a haphazard, home-grown program."
2,beware of the clasp,the necklace itself is great. The clasp that it comes with is another story. The clasp came apart twice the first week we had it. It was very thin and fragile. I ended up taking it to a jeweler and having a lobster claw clasp put on it so it wouldn't fall off and get lost
2,Not extending the magic very far.,"While this album does contain all of the requisite Cake elements--horns, deadpan lyrics, really random references--it lacks the punch of previous efforts, most notably Fashion Nugget. The only song that even measures up to expectations is Sheep Go to Heaven, which includes the memorable line, ""The Gravedigger puts on the forceps."""
3,Some Good Songs on a FAIR Album,"I miss their style on ""Motercade of Generosity"", and the great sequal album ""Fashion Nugget"". This album leaves me unsatisfied with the band. They have lost a number of musicians, and this may be a big part of it. I think that if this new version of Cake matured together they may make a real comeback on their next album. I loved ""Satan is My Motor"" and ""Let Me Go"". The rest of the CD was up and down for me. I recomend buying this CD is you are a Cake fan, but buy ""Motercade of Generosity"" and ""Fashion Nugget"" first. And be looking for their new album."
3,Uneven followup to the brilliant Fashion Nugget,"Fashion Nugget is a brilliantly funny, musical, diverse and pensive album. Every song is listenable, different, and captivates your attention. Not so with Prolonging the Magic. I found many of the songs boring and uninspired. They sounded much more homogenous, compared to Cake's prior releases. ""Satan is my Motor"" and ""Sheep Go To Heaven"" were the good songs on the CD - interesting, given the fact that they're the quirkiest. Is Cake reserving its talent for the 'quirky' songs that gained it its fame? That would be a disappointment.Anyhow - this album's good; Cake fans will like it. But it's nowhere near the ""Top 10 Rock Albums of All Time"" that Fashion Nugget earned."
3,Nice...but uninspiring...,"If you were expecting the lesser-known tracks on ""Prolonging the Magic"" to resemble the techno funk-influenced, strong beat, and original sounds of their radio hit ""Never there"" you will be disappointed. While there are some interesting lyrics and competent musical skill, the remainder of the album acheives with stunning accuracy the ""every local band"" sound you'll find in semi-professional clubs in most any major city. While Cake does this sound quite nicely, it is not terribly original. Frankly, if I'm going to purchase music of ""every local band"" quality, I prefer to do so supporting a local band."
5,Cake Rules,"This band is one of the greatest out there...fashion nugget caught my attention, motorcade of generosity showed they diserved it, and prolonging the magic just managed to solidify my statement that cake rules"
4,Keep the Cake coming.,"Wow, another good album. The odd-numbered tracks are really good, and ""Guitar"" rocks. Wow, good."
4,Third great album,"More of what you love from Cake. I am surprised though, to hear several people in these reviews say that John McCrea is singing more instead of his ""usual"" spoken-word style. May I point out that only 5 of the 27 songs on the first two cd's are spoken. The rest are sung. So there. :)"
5,Dumb lyrics? No! Dumb listeners? Perhaps....,"I'm dismayed by the number of reviewers who seem baffled by the lyric's in this CD (and the other Cake CD's too.) Many songs take lines directly from the Bible, believe it or not! On this album, ""Sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell"" is something Jesus said to his disciples. Throughout Cake's music, there is evidence that at least one of their writers is familiar with other scriptures. (""You part the waters"".... and *I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment* also come to mind.)As for the lyrics being dumb, anyone who has studied Surrealism (Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte) know that two seemingly unrelated ideas juxtaposed often result in a deeper truth... and humour. That's why I listen all the time to Cake's three albums. They have holding power because they are deep as well as funky. They're my favorite group.Incidentally, I'm a high school teacher in her 50's. My son who lives in CA. gave me my first Cake CD."
3,"""Sheep goda heaven, goats goda hell...","...Sheep goda heaven, goats.....goda hell...goda hell...goda hell...goda hell..."" This song is being relentlessly overexposed on this college's radio station. I'm in the truck I drive on the job with the school station on the radio--maybe not--I'm out of the truck more than I'm in. But after work I spend just under an hour in the Nautilus gym and it always pops up on the PA. The phrase ""go to hell"" is without a doubt my father's favorite expression--and his WWII generation always claimed us Boomers had no respect! With whom as role models, huh? Geeeeez! Of course, it could be worse. Last summer's big o.d. on the station was ""The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. We don't need no water, let the mother kerr-dah burn."" Kerr-dah is an electronic censorship sound found maybe only on broadcast copies--I don't know if the copy you buy has the kerr-dah or the word it replaces. And I could care less!"
2,it doesn't have lyrics..........its sucks!!!,"I'm really want it but like i said It doesn't have lyrics...with it.........YOU KNOW WHAT!!Its cool!! especially the ""LET ME GO""..I hope next time you guys gonna put lyrics on your next album!!!bye. Anyway.....Fans from Modesto Ca..Manny,carl,Ann-Ann,Gio,Din And everybody in dah house!!!:):)"
1,Who's writing these reviews?,"My god, when was the last time you looked at reviews for anything for sale by Amazon.com that wasn't glowing? This album can't hold a candle to Fashion Nugget yet somehow there are numerous reviews proclaming how wonderful this album is. It's awful.Don't fall for the machine. All these reviews are written my Amazon marketing staff."
2,Yawn-o-delic,"I guess Cake lost one of their members since Fashion Nugget?? Well, not since Van Halen lost David Lee Roth has a band so palpably lost their fundamental soul and personality. I was blown away by Fashion Nugget, and I was similarly truly intrigued by Motorcade of Generosity. My mind , as others' apparently have, made comparisons to the Beatles...these guys had a distinct, haunting sound. But this album--entitled self-flatteringly ""Prolonging the Magic""--wow, I've played it ten times or more, and it has had no effect on me whatsoever. It's not annoying really, but it does not have any ambience at all similar to its two predecessors. It's not quite background noise...it's more like it drones on in the background and you don't even know it's there. These guys have got to make up with their estranged band member and get their sound back on track. What a shame. The ""Magic"" is not ""Prolonged"" by this album; it's shot stone-cold dead."
2,Same ol' same ol',"It's often hard to tell each track from another, every track is unremarkable, and uniquely Cake. If you like Cake, get this cd, because it sounds like everything else they've done. If you don't like Cake, congratulations."
4,"Simple, beautiful music with which to relax.","My friends have a band, and they play some Cake songs, that's where I fell in love with ""Never There."" Yes, it is a short song, but one of the best on this album. Cake keeps a simple, beautiful sound throughout the work; this is why I like them. This simplicity continues into the artwork on the cover. Pure and true, that's how they hook you and that's why you'll stay. Buy this album, and whenever you need something to calm you, cheer you up, or just some quiet piece of music to make the day go away, pop this baby in."
5,How did I hear of Cake?,I love this CD so much. I never heard of Cake until I found out it was my hottie's favorite band. So I borrowed the CD from my best friend. I fell in love with Cake. My favorite song is Never There. I have every CD.
4,the evolution of Cake,"This CD has just been released and is off to a slow start with alot of fans. Neverthere is receiving heavy primetime radio play in the Minneapolis/St.Paul area. This track is bubbly and moves along quickly with that classic horn floating through the riffs, several breaks make ya wonder if you can still walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. Another strong track is Sheep Go to Heaven, classic quirky Cake with a heavy rythym, this song alone is worth the purchase of the whole CD...other strong tracks include Mexico, Guitar, Walk On By and Cool Blue Reason. In summary, If you liked Fashion Nugget, you will like Prolonging the Magic... Jaggie"
4,Prolong this...,"Well, I don't really know what to say. I mean, Fashion Nugget used to be quite awesome, but now I'm somewhat tired of it. Will Prolonging The Magic suffer the same fate? Who knows. Its certainly a different album--the whole feel of it is different. There's a lot more experimentation (if you want to call it that). Never There, Hem Of Your Garment, and Sheep Go To Heaven are the best tunes. The thing I don't like is that it doesn't have the quirkiness that the first record had. SOme of the songs do, but on the whole, it just seems like the band wasn't as enthusiastic while manking this record. John McRea sings a bit too much, instead of his traditional speaking of the lines, but thats ok most of the time. Only on songs like You Turn THe Screws does he get bothersome. So, I guess you should pick it up if you've got some dough. I like it, but the question is, will you?"
4,typical cake with some new instruements,"Cake is at its best with "" You Turn the Screws"" but "" Never There"" is also a notable song. Their style is unmistakable and always liked."
4,Track 11 Alone,"I just listened to track 11, ""Let Me Go"", and from that one song, I would buy this CD. Cake is very quirky, with a rockabilly power-pop sound that is very easy to listen to, and the lyrics are light and goofy, but still have something to say. A good buy."
5,The magic has been prolonged,"One word: Awesome! Or in two words: Kick a**!! Anybody who does not own this or any of Cake's CD's are definately missing out!! Their twangy funk rock is groovin. Anybody who doesn't like cake must be insane! Besides awesome music they entertain you with metaphors that they use in all their songs. Listen and try to figure them out. They tell you a lot about life that is not right at the surface. You have to reach for it. And also, their ""philosophy"" that music should be listened to and not read says it all. Cake rocks and they always will!!! woo hoo!!! ="
5,Great CD with Great Lyrics,"The people who dislike this CD's lyrics clearly fail to see the symbolism in them. Starting with Rock and Roll lifestyle, this group has consistantly used lyrics to display a social conscience. From the commentary on how are society rewards being followers and not individuality on Sheep go to Heaven to John McCrae's questioning his life as a musician on Guitar, this is a deep album. A great follow up album from the local band! P.S. They're awesome in concert too!"
3,GOOD...,"The other reviews say theyve matured, but I don't think so. Cake is a great band, but this CD is definitely lacking the fun of the other 2, and they don't even sound as talented. This album has some great songs, but nothing fantastic like Mr Mastadon Farm or Italian leather sofa. At least sheep go to heaven and guitar give me the same ""cake"" feeling as before, but the problem is that I got that from just about all of motorcade, so its a little disappointing. Buy it, but not if you haven't bought the first 2."
4,A band who can rock and is not over produced,"Cake comes back with another great full length album. In this album they experiment with more country rock and various styles, yet they still maintain they' re same great sound. If you're looking for some catchy tunes you'll definately find them hear with songs like "" Sheep Go To Heaven"" and ""Guitar."" This band continues to be the hippest band out in the rock circuit and I hope they keep putting out great albums and never sell out>"
5,one of the best cds ever,"this cd changed music forever. cake's moving lyrics and awesome overall sound make them the best band to listen to, whether you like punk, rock, or (ewwwwww) pop or rap. buy this cd!"
2,Disappointment,"I thought ""Fashion Nugget"" kicked butt, but this CD was a disappointment. There were no fast moving intense songs like ""The Distance"""
2,Cake's lowest point,"I bought Prolonging the Magic years ago with high expectations. The first four tracks are good, and are worth the low price. Satan Is My Motor was of the quality I expected from Cake, coming in solidly with John McCrea's solid vocal and a tight groove from the band. The melancholy Mexico follows, another solid song, not quite as good as the first track. Never There, the single, is a departure from everything else on the album to make a single in the style of The Distance, but after awhile the catchy hook grows thin, as the song lacks much substance. Guitar is a nice song too. The rest of the album is listenable, mostly, but is all filler except Sheep Go To Heaven. From a musician's point of view, the rest of the album is plain, boring chord progressions, lyrics that appear to have meaning but are actually quite empty.Prolonging The Magic is a bland album."
4,Cake Surprises Again,"Cake had one hit wonder written all over them after ""The Distance."" Seemed to be a bit of a novelty song. However, they are quite varied in their styles, and this CD reflects that. ""Sheep go to Heaven"" and ""Never There"" keep the same song format as Fashion Nugget, and reflect the creativity of the songwriting. I don't know about song one, with references to Satan, but the rest of the songs are suitable for playing. Alpha Beta Parking Lot is a great stalker song, and they keep coming up with novelty songs that just rock! They remind me, lyrically, of the Presidents, but with staying power. A good, solid album."
4,CAKE - LAYERS YET TO BE DISCOVERED,"I don't know if cake knows what it's capable of, but a few more years of living will reveal the complex layers. The talent is immense. To me there's more words being spoken in the music than the actual lyrics.Their use of trumpets and (the mandolin?) are the answer to the stale guitar/drum rhythms that plague the norm... brings an international mediterranean ""ska"" flavor.Every song that means anything to me has a story attached. ""Where would I be"" brings the desolation of being an American broke in Poland (stolen purse).Cake is no where near filling it's hard drive capabilities. Just a matter of letting ""The Cure""-like experimentations go and committing to quality lyrics worthy of it's kick-@#5 music."
2,BUY FASHION NUGGET OR MOTORCADE INSTEAD,"This CD is not that great. A few decent songs, that is all. Fashion Nugget was a creative masterpiece, and the peak of their musical career. They experiment more into country music with this one (don't get me wrong, some country is good), but they just don't handle it that well. I suggest listening to several of its songs before purchasing. If you like it, that's fantastic. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and mine is that this CD isn't worth 13 or 14 bucks."
2,This is one Cake that doesn't rise to the occasion.,"Was ""Fashion Nugget"" a fluke? This formulaic, food-processed followup sure makes it seem that way. What's more irritating than the mind-numbing repetitiveness of standard Cake ingredients (that thundering bass, that echoey voice, those edgy staccato guitar riffs--all of which worked so well on past albums) are the obnoxious ""Oh-Nos!"" and ""He'yahs!"" that punctuate the trumpet solos on each song except for the third. It's like sticking Twinkies in the middle of a Ho-Ho: redundant and tasteless. This album is Cake extruded into a Dixie Cup, to make a mock cupCake. What recipe were they following? How many cavities will they cause? At least one--in my wallet. I wish I'd read my review before I bought the album."
4,Fashion Nugget is too good to top. But Cake is still tasty!!,"Fashion Nugget was such a good CD it would have been difficult to top. But this Cake album is still delicious! As strong or stronger than their first album, Cake has such a distinctive sound, they truly are a fresh alternative to the""alternative"" crap on the radio. The album has fun hip hop beats mixed with Beatlesque melodies and an interesting arrangement of vocals and instruments. Track 3. NEVER THERE, is obviously the hit off the album but there are several other strong offerings. Track 1. SATAN IS MY MOTOR 2. MEXICO 7. SHEEP GO TO HEAVEN. If you liked the first two Cake CDs you'll find Prolonging The Magic, well worth your money."
4,Dance around your living room to this one,"I just read the first 5 reviews from purist fans who carefully reviewed the bands' history, compared this to other albums blah blah blah. Bottom line for those who want to take this for face value, it is a blast to listen to.. Nice yet twisted and dark humor music. Never There? Man, I have worn grooves in our hardwoods dancing around to that one. How very very fun!! No deep intellectual debate needed on this album. Just listen to it, for God's sake."
4,Great Album expect for tracks 1&7,Satan is my Motor and Sheep go to Heaven rock expect for their stupid lyrics(My only regrets about buying the album). The rest of the album is awesome. PTM makes up for it's lack of kick(like in Fashion Nugget) with enjoyable and easy to listen songs(expect for tracks 1&7).
3,Not as Good as Expected,"I've read almost everything by this author and liked them all. So, I was surprised that I lost patience with the heroine. Her animosity towards Waldo wasn't believable or sympathetically written. This did improve in the latter half of the story but it's a shame that you have to wait that long."
2,Needs editing,"This novel was all over the place and in sorely need of editing. Some nice interepersonal twists but jeez, having to wade through so many irrelevant scenes and story lines...I skipped much of it. This was my first experience with this author and, frankly, I'm surprised about the raves from Linda Howard and Mary Balogh, two ladies that really know how to keep a story moving. This book needs major surgery - there is a story here, but getting to it is *work*."
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I was required to read this book for a college course and I really did not enjoy it. Although the author speaks and writes well, I felt like he was redundant and kept coming back to points he had already made, as if he couldn't get over it, accept it, and move on. I understand this is a memoir, but I just could not bring myself to sympathize with the authors plight, especially over how difficult it is for him to get his haircut...I do recommend this book for more sympathetic people than myself, and people who may appreciate his struggle more than I ever could."
2,Amusing but forgettable,This is a light entertaining story good for reading when you don't want to think a whole lot and just want something to occupy your thoughts. Its nice and short which is good because if the book had been much longer it would have become tiresome. As it is the book is amusing while you're reading it but there's nothing remarkable enough about it to make you remember it once you've put it down.
4,Light and entertaining-good beach book,"This is a classic Babson book, murder, evil relatives and cats, what more could you want?"
1,Terrible Cell Case,"The product came in a timely fashion, but the quality was terrible. It is hard plastic that has rough edges, so when you're talking on the phone the rough edges scrap against your face and get's caught on your hair. I returned the case and bought another case that was a little more money and it is a better case. They was no problem with the refund. I give the case 1 star, and the company 5 stars."
1,Very weak plastic,"The plastic began to crack within two days... there is a thin strip of plastic above the usb/charger plugin that cracked in half almost immediately - and the thin piece above the camera also cracked and broke off.The seller told me (after the fact, of course) that by design clear plastic material is very weak.There are five very noticeable cracks after only a month of having the case - and I imagine it won't be too long until the completely crumbles.Not even worth the $.01 I paid for it."
5,Prowlpuss is for all ages!,"I bought this book for the little girl I babysit for's third birthday. I was attracted by the rich colours of the cover illustration, the roll-off-your-tongue title and being a cat person, the subject. When I opened and read the T.S. Eliotesque rhymes, I knew I had to have it. I read it aloud in the car. My eight year-old brother loved it. My forty year-old mother loved it. Thirteen year-old me adored it and didn't want to give it up. Now, more than a year later, ordering a copy as a Christmas present for my two year-old cousin Emily, I'm also getting a copy for myself."
5,Thank you,"Thank you for this wonderful book. It supports the delicate, difficult, and controversial issue of repressed memories with an amazing amount of knowledge and information that is based on both theory and actual experiences. The book has helped me to begin this long and difficult process of memory recovery. Frederickson's insights about each step of the process are incredibly helpful, and I can say with confidence that after reading this book I am no longer a victim in my own life."
3,Be sure to be prepared,"I started reading this book, I later found that much of it was too difficult for me to deal with. I know that perhaps I will find a time that is better to try and get through it. If you consider purchasing this book be prepared to have a good support network."
1,MORE BAD SCIENCE,"This book is full of pseudoscience. I can't help wondering if ""Sarah,"" mentioned at the opening of the book, really has emerged 'more serene than she thought possible' from her journey of discovery of the 'abuse that shaped her adult life.' Supposedly she was happy at the time she started to have flashbacks. So how did horrifying abuse shape her adult life of happiness?On another note, people who believe they have recovered lost memories of abuse need to be honest with themselves. How much were these 'memories' influenced by what a therapist has suggested or by what you saw in a movie, TV show or news report? I haven't been able to find one case where a 'recovered' memory of abuse has had outside corroboration."
2,Disapproved of the plot!,"After reading 'Henley's 'Pirate and the Pagen, Raven and the Rose, and the Falcon and the Flower', I found that 'Hawk and Dove' scored the same as 'Dragon and Jewel' on my 'read again only if on a remote island and there are no natives to talk to'. Virginia Henley is one of my favorite authors! I loved all the characters in the three novels mentioned above, however, as I stated in reviewing 'Dragon and Jewel', I was disappointed by 'Henley', but alas, I own 'Pirate and Pagan (disapproved of the adultery plot), Raven and Rose, and Falcon and Flower', and they are my cherished 'dime store purchases'. Maybe I disliked this novel because at the time I was reading 'Hawk and the Dove', I kept thinking, if that was my husband cheating on me with me, I would slip poison in his wine goblet."
2,Hawk and the Dove - read only if desperate and snowed in!,"After reading 'Henley's 'Pirate and the Pagan, Raven and the Rose, and the Falcon and the Flower', I found that 'Hawk and Dove' scored the same as 'Dragon and Jewel' on my 'read again only if on a remote island and there are no natives to talk to'. Virginia Henley is one of my favorite authors! I loved all the characters in the three novels mentioned above, however, as I stated in reviewing 'Dragon and Jewel', I was disappointed by 'Henley', but alas, I own 'Pirate and Pagan (disapproved of the adultery plot), Raven and Rose, and Falcon and Flower', and they are my cherished 'dime store purchases'. Maybe I disliked this novel because at the time I was reading 'Hawk and the Dove', I kept thinking, if that was my husband cheating on me with me, I would slip poison in his wine goblet"
1,Could have been a good book,"I was disgusted when I read this book. Most of it would have been okay if the ""Sea God"" hadn't raped Sabre. It was completely unforgivable, but of course she ends up in love with him. Sabre is not the kind of woman who would let a man get away with that or fall in love with him after raping her. She is too proud and self-respecting."
1,Boring Book,This book was highly recommended on several sites so I was really looking forward to reading it. I was very disappointed. The book rambled. It lost my interest quickly. I did not finish it. Too many great books out there to waste my time on one I had to work to make myself pick up.
3,Held my attention but...something was missing,"I picked this book up because I had read ""A year and a Day"" and ""A Woman of Passion"" and thought Ms.Henley was a very captivating writer. The Hawk and the Dove was fast-paced, and while it did keep me reading, ultimately something was missing. Typical to romances, both the hero and heroine were unbelievably good-looking, but I thought both to be vain and self-absorbed. While the plot wasn't horrible, it wasn't great. If you're looking for some hot sex scenes, I would recommend this to you, but if you want a more substantial read, look elsewhere"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I tried Virginia Henley's A Year and a Day first and loved it so I decided to try this after reading some of the reviews. BIG MISTAKE. Was this the same author? This book had terrible, shallow characters and an uninteresting plot. The so-called hero was a violently jealous uncaring tyrant and the heroine was just plain stupid and unbelievable. A Year and a Day was much better but after reading this trash I don't know if I'll ever try another Henley book."
3,basic fun,"This toy is great for a little kids hands. However, when you squeeze the legs, the arms kind of move, but not really either. That's what is supposed to set this TMNT apart from the other ones. So, not a lot of action occurs when you squeeze the legs, but hey, my little boy still loves the turtles and he loves to play with whether the arms are moving or not."
1,Beloved Soundtrack Review,"Rachel Portman is one of my favorite film-music composers; however, I didn't like Beloved's score. I expected a pleasant orchestral music similar to other Rachel Portman's film scores, but I was very disappointed."
4,Good music,"I had a version of this collection on vinyl many years ago, it was great then, and it is still wonderful to listen to."
3,Works.. sorta,"this works if you apply daily. Doesn't have a pleasant smell, but doesn't have a horrible smell either. the cats hate anything sprayed, so i am not sure it if it's the actual spray or the act of spraying that keeps them away. But.. if you don't apply daily, it doesn't have a lasting effect"
4,Works with persistent application,"As recommended in product directions I tucked a strip of cotton fabric into new shrubs (yews) that were being targeted. Has taken a couple of months to see improvement. My dog now targets a mature tree, but perhaps a visitor continued to mark the new shrubs when I missed a few days of application."
5,Christmas Tree Saver,This is the best!!! I have tried everything and cannot keep two of my cats off the tree. My cats hate the product and will not go near the Christmas tree!!! Smells like apples.....it is not repulsive. A+++ from me.
5,A Great Fusion of Cumbia and Rock en Espanol,"I was pleased to discover this band when my own group (Babaloo) was booked to open for them. They manage to take the energy of rocknroll and dispense with the cliched rock rhythms that caused me to first explore Latin music. The vocals are terrific and ensemble work is amazing, creating atmospheric space one moment, a powerful thundering the next, and an wonderful interweaving of parts on their salsa outings. Note that they have the courage to doo all of these in the same song. A special treat is their beautiful reinterpretation of the Peregoyo Y Su Combo Vacana classic, ""La Pluma,"" that paying tribute to their predecessors on the Columbian music scene all while presenting their own unique vision."
5,Memories with music,"With Mattie gone this CD takes on a whole different meaning and power - in hearing his voice and his words that he recorded forever. They are the words of two children working together to share a message with the world, a message that anything can be accomplished including peace and celebration of life and conquering a relentless foe with pure determination. His poems range from heartbreaking to childhood innocence begging the world to return to that time where everything was appreciated and celebrated, where monsters were only shadows on the wall and set to music they take flight in a whole new way. An incredible legacy Mattie provides in his life, his writing, his poems, and the songs that are on this CD that are Heartsongs freely sung."
5,He strikes again,"This is a great cd. and Jose u are a moron. that boy obviously has found something in his life that is good, and you are just breaking him down. so shame be to you. i may be young but i know for sure that this is a 5 star album and billys voice just gets better every cd. So Billy and Mattie, good luck to u!"
1,BILLIH!,"Me and Verdra love Billih, so of course we love this! It is stariffic. If you are a fan of British, Drrrrrrrrty or Aaron, you should buy this!!!!!"
1,Two negatives didn't make a positive,"I wish I could have rated it minus 5 stars. Is it bad for a couple 12 year olds? no. That being said- This CD is pathetic. I aquired this cd from the used cd bin. Whichever adults put this product out as a real cd, should receive the music-industry equivalent of being defrocked. I laughed at how shmaltzy this was, then I just got really offended at how easily some music producers think some people are to amuse. If you're a guest at my house and I made you a doghair and vaseline sandwhich and expected you to like it you'd be offended too, right?Having a goodie two-shoes purveyor of already established truths set to music by a goodie two-shoes singer of sappy ballads written by 45 year old saps, but who tries to pass them off as his own is just an ugly idea. I mean, really. If you are a par of a scavenger hunt to find the worst cd you can, buy this one and thank me later."
3,MDA Patient's Poems Drive L.P,"Mattie Stepanek is no longer with us, and anyone with a heart enjoys his Heartsongs. Billy Gilman enjoyed them so much, that he made a record based on his poetry. Mattie should have found a better voice to bring his poems to musical life. Billy is a pre-pubescent genius but Adolescence has Destroyed him. His vocals are Uneven, and his notes are laboured. Mattie was great. Billy Just sucks."
1,he needs the help!,"Billy Gilman and Mattie. sounds like the worst pairing since Jacko and little boy (you choose which one). The music, if that is what we are calling it, is dull and unimaginative while the lyric is trite and insulting to the listener. to think that two pre-pubescent teens game pass on valuable life lessons is insulting and they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. the only reason to buy this CD is as a cruel joke for a stocking stuffer for the boss you dispise. Happy listening.-tim (not from the heartland)"
1,Because there's no zero,"Billy Gilman is an extremely talented person, and his voice is amazing. But with talent like that, you'd think he could have better things to do than sing Mattie's poetry. Mattie Stepanek was a very courageous person, but that doesn't mean he was a writer. I'm amazed at the people that call him a ""best-selling"" poet. His poetry is absolutely ridiculous, and the only reason it sells is because people feel sorry for poor kid."
3,Something is Missing Here ?,"As being a fan of Billy Gilman, I was waiting for this new cd to come out, but When I listened to it is was a challenge to listen to billy singing in poem form and not the regular stuff fans are use to from hearing from his last three he put out. I was hoping to hear stuff from the One Voice or the Dare to Dream or even his holiday cd within this new cd.Billy has a great Voice and I think it is a great voice but I really was looking for a upbeat cd from his work... I know the voice has changed and it sounds awsome but I would have to agree with some others writing their review here that I was really disappointed to hear only 2 track out of 12 from this one being great. Which is are track 7 and 9.I want the old gilman sound back and better then ever when ever that one is to come out."
1,Blurry picture problem and only 3 month warranty !,I noticed that all my pictures where blurry on the right side. I got the camera in june 03. Warranty Labor is only 3 month! I e-mailed customer service to complain ... The response was a 'predefined' answer. around 140$ repair no matter what . That represents half the price of the camera.... So be cautious before choosing this camera. Most competitors offer 1 year warranty...
1,Flash became intermittent,After a few months of light use the flash became intermittent. You never know when or if it will work. Called Sony and they wanted around $150.00 for repair. Ridiculous! I do not recommend this camera.
2,I used to like it,"We used our camera for a couple of months, and liked it a lot, before we noticed battery life degrading. Thought it may be the rechargables but regular alkaline batteries didn't last long either. Sometimes freshly charged batteries would be put in the camera and they would go dead without any / many pictures being taken. Camera appears to have a power drain even when ""off"". Sony was willing to pay for parts if we payed for labor - labor started at $150.00."
4,"3 mp, 3x optical, 300 bucks.. not bad","I bought this for my wife, I own the 707 model. Takes very good pix, 3 megapixels and a 3x optical lens ( stay away from the digital zoom cameras ), you'll need 128 card (lexar brand is good). The only negative thing is the plastic housing that the camera is encased in."
5,A First Time Digital Camera Buyer,"This is the first digital camera I buy and I really like it. It's very easy to use for a novice like me. Picture quality is good, movie mode is really cool. Price is reasonable especially because I got this camera with a free 32MB Lexar memory stick promotion and free shipping. Only downside is that the LCD screen will go off for a second or two if you use a flash. Other than that, I couldn't find anything that I don't like. A perfect for non-professional photographer."
4,It meets my expectations.,"Sony is good. I bought this camera before Christmas and for the last 6 months, its been working very good.The pictures shot in daylight are flawless, I havent compared it with any other camera, but they look very good.In the night, putting the camera on Night mode makes it work good. However the night is not as good as the day ones(obviously).The zoom is good, the camera came with 4 rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. Had to buy a memory card and a camera case.Worked good.Pros:1) Nice screen.2) Very Nice camera in good light.3) Zoom is good enough for most photographs.4) Sturdy, Dropped twice, nothing happened(luckily).5) Also lets you capture video(video quality not very bad).Cons:1) Not so good during low light.2) Battery Consumption is very high. Cannot go without the charger and the extra pair of batteries.3) Stabilizer not effective on full ZOOM."
1,Lens won't open,"I got this camera for 4 months and all of a sudden the lens won't open automatically when powered-on.As it is out of the 90-labor warranty, the repair will cost $150.Therefore, if you haven't done so, maybe you should consider a extended warranty."
2,Awesome.........WHEN IT WORKS!!,"I too, as another reviewer , ""mrs oliver"" says:Loved it too, when it works.BEAUTIFUL DAY PICTURES.....BLURRY DARK/DUSK PICTURESAfter about 6 months for me, at Christmas, the camera started turning off unexpectedly. The camera won't turn on at all when its acting up. When we try to turn it on, the power light blinks on, and the lens extends inward and closes, but then the camera turns off again. And vice versa, when we turn it off the lens extends outward and stays put....Ive had trouble 3xs and lost chances taking pictures in Disney & a wedding recently. We've changed the batteries from new in the package to new recharged type, Best Buy told me to ONLY USE EXPENSIVE ALKALINE, LIKE DURACELLS.It has been sent out thru Best Buy 3xs and every time its a lens issue.....IM TIRED OF IT! ATLEAST I BOUGHT A 3YR WARRANTYPLEASE BE CERTAIN B4 YOU BUY,,,,,,SONY ''USUALLY'' IS AN ELECTRONIC LEADER, BUT NOT EVERYONE IS FAULTLESSWISHSLM@AOL.COM"
4,NICE AND COMPACT!,I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA ABOUT 6 MOS AGO LOVED IT! TAKES GREAT PICS CRISP AND CLEAR. I PUT ADDED ACCESSORY OF SNAP ON ZOOM LENS BECAUSE I TAKE PICS OF MY KIDS AT THEIR CONCERTS AND THE REG ZOOM WASNT STRONG ENOUGH. VERY EASY TO USE. MY ONLY PROBLEM NOW IS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT -WHEN I CLICKED A PIC -TOOK THE PICTURE RIGHT AWAY. NOW HOWEVER I DONT KNOW IF I MESSED UP THE SETTINGS (I KEEP READING BOOK AND CANT FIND OUT HOW TO FIX IT) WHEN I TAKE A PIC AND PRESS THE BUTTON IT TAKES LIKE 5 SECS FOR PIC TO SNAP??? BY THEN WHAT I WAS TAKING A PIC OF MOVED. ITS VERY ANNOYING AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX SO I CAN JUST SNAP A PIC?? OTHER THEN THAT I LIKE THE CAMERA. WILL HAVE TO CALL SONY AND SEE IF THEY CAN HELP ME BECAUSE ITS VERY ANNOYING AND WHEN U WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER PIC REAL QUICK AFTER ONE U JUST TOOK U CANT TAKES FOREVER.....
4,Worked for me,"Got this a few months ago. It is a fun camera to have. Taking and deleting pix is a breeze. You quickly learn, however, that you must hold fairly still when taking some of the pictures (depending on mode you are in)as action shots can be blurry. I am sure I need to learn more about it to improve on that tho. Camera has an auto mode as well that works good. The memory stick that comes w/ it is poor-- buy one that has 128 MB and you are set. Took this camera on vacation (9 days) and stored over 120 pictures and two small movies without having to download for more space or change batteries.... Software is not great, better stuff out there. Takes wonderful pictures of flowers, colorful things. I have yet to learn all that it does, but it is a great buy for me and my family."
5,good camera,"this is a great camera. The software that comes with it is horrible, like all sony software, so if you have windows XP dont install it and use the automatic driver. only bad thing is that the batteries dont last long."
1,Broke within 100 days,A terrible product. It broke -- would not turn on -- about three months after receiving it and about a week after seriously using it. Repair cost (Because after 90 days parts warranty expired): $150.00 -- over half the cost of the camera.
5,Ignore fake review,"Do not believe what ""barbara carroll"" says about this breaking when her warranty expired. Sure there could be an occasional ""lemon,"" even from Sony. But if you register the camera you get a one-year warranty, and this is a relative new product. So if what she says is true she only has herself to blame. This camera is a solid buy and the picture quality is amazing. Because I have a large collection of (cheap) SD cards I prefer a camera that uses SD card, but I've used the Sony many times (my good friend has one) and I really like its quality."
1,Only Lasted One Year,I bought a Sony Cybershot a little over a year ago and it just stopped taking pictures. Everything works fine but the picture will not snap. Called Sony. They were no help. They wanted me to send the camera to them with $117 and they would take a look at it. Advise is to steer clear of this camera. Sony will not support it.
1,TOO MANY BLURRY PICTURES!,Good color BUT NOT reliable to take clear pictures. TOO MANY BLURRY PICTURES! Thinking about class action on Sony as there are a bunch out there that have the same issue.VERY disappointed.
1,Sony DSCP72 is the worst.....,"It worked fair the first year. Good pictures mixed with blurry. The flash re-charge took a long time (8+ seconds) with new batteries! Several times the camera has gotten into a mode where power off extended the lens out and then powered off the electronics. Conversly, powering on the camera re-tracted the lens and then powered off. It wouldn't allow you to take pictures in this mode. Now it is in that mode forever. New batteries, reset, etc. will not recover the camera.I bought it on the Sony name because of reputation for good products.I will not buy another Sony camera.Read other postings here and elsewhere to find a similar trend of problems with Sony cameras."
2,Fine for a year or so,"I bought this camera and was fairly happy with it for about a year. Sometimes it took very blurry pictures, but overall they were good quality pictures and it feels good to hold. However, I had the same problem as ""Niwot Bob"" described below. After about a year I started having a lot of trouble with this camera, I couldn't get it to turn on or take pictures at all. I called Sony's service center and they wanted $120 just to look at it. I'm not the only person I've heard of to have these problems with this camera. I would suggest finding another model or you will be shopping for another one not long after the warranty expires."
2,Picture quality not the best,"I bought this camerata yesterday on the strength of the other customer reviews here, but today it went back to the store. My picture files had lots of pixels, but mediocre contrast and only so-so sharpness. I have owned both a Fuji Finepix 2400 and 2800, and both of these cameras took much sharper pictures than this Sony. My guess is that the culprit in the Sony camera is the lens -- all the electronics seemed to work OK.Update, May 17Since writing the above I have purchased a Canon A70, which is comparable in size and price to this Sony...with the same number of megapixels.The Canon gives the photographer a lot more potential control, including, if one wishes, the ability to set f stops and shutter speeds manually. Most important, the lens is much better than the Sony's, and my pictures are much sharper, with excellent definition and contrast. So in my opinion the Canon A70 is a much better value."
3,Really Bad Picture Quality.,"This $300 sony DC really disappointed me!All images I take show color spots, a lot of background noiseon the photo.I own a 2 years old Nikon DC and compare with the sony stuff I canonly say that sony sucks on photo technology.I think the DC is a weakness for all sony product. I have asony digital camcorder(TRV27), the still photo taken by it showsmany color noise points, too.Suggestion: Don't buy it. Read journal's review aboutDV and buy good-rated products( Like Nikon, Fujifilm, Olympus)."
2,Doesnot Stream,Disappointed when I cannot use this digital camera as web cam. The only function that USB can do is copy from the memory stick to your computer.Also when reviewing the clicked photos the photos remain hazy for more than 10 seconds. Donot know why but very annoying.
3,Beautiful Photos.,"It's priced well an gets well lit photos.It doesn't focus as well shooting indoors. The more light there is for focusing the better. The focus assist beam helps. Outside photos have no problem.Also, with no flash, photos indoors can appear shaked, but not that bad.Video capabilty to good for the price. You can start recording an image quicker even if its 60% of 1mp for video. Helpful when you have limited time and cant take a photo.Useful modes, effects and beutiful photos make it a pleasing camera to have."
5,Better than Irish Tenors Christmas album,"I also have the Irish Tenors ""Home for Christmas"" CD and prefer this one. McDermott's relaxed voice and the subdued musical arrangements create a more intimate and moving environment. Backed by a full orchestra, the Tenors' Christmas album often sounds bombastic. On some songs, it sounds like they're trying to out-shout each other. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Goog book,This product is same as described in purchase. Delivery was very quickly and good conditions. I recommend this product and provider. Sincerely. Jose Pena
4,Dope Single {4 Stars},"I remember feeling this when it dropped. The Fugees were fresh off of dropping The Score the previous year ('96), so everything they touched was golden. All three of them (yes, including Pras) do their thing, but Lauryn's verse is classic. Even Wyclef's verse was dope. Couple that with Bounty Killer, who has always been dope in my mind despite what others say about his lyrical content, and you have a can't miss hit. Even the video was on point. My only beef is the fact that the track is edited, but it does say radio edit on the back. If there's an unedited version, I don't know about it, but I'd love to have it.The second track, Living Dangerously featuring Barrington Levy, was a track that I didn't really appreciate when this single first dropped. I like it now even thought I couldn't stand it back in '97. It has more of a dancehall flavor to it than the first track."
3,Acid Mothers Temple - 'SWR' (Very Friendly),"This particular 'incarnation' of the Acid Mothers Temple legacy didn't exactly blow my mind like so many of their other CD's. Couldn't help but to notice sort of a Captain Beefheart / Faust vibe on this title. Maybe a bit too out-there for some. Couple of these tracks I liked include ""Eat A Pebble"", the toe-tapping ""Good Buddha"" and the seven-minute ""There Is Nothing To Make You Happy In This Box"". Line-up: Kawabata Makoto - guitar & vocals, Tsuyama Atsushi - bass & vocals Yoshida Tatsuya (Ruins) - drums & vocals."
3,Not what I expected,I have the So Utah bike o vision DVD and I love it! I was anxious to try Hawaii and I was disappointed. I found the DVD to be very dreary and boring. I think if they had made the video when the sun was shining it would have been a completely different video. It was overcast and rainy throughout most of the video. There were beautiful beach shots and inland shots but the video could not hold my interest due to the lack of sunshine. I would not recommend this video if you are like me and prefer the sun to keep you motivated.
3,"Okay DVD, a bit dizzying.","I use these dvd's to run on the treadmill. I have purchased several other Bike-O-Vision dvd's for the same purpose and this isn't one of my favorites. The scenery is good in a lot of the dvd, but I really don't like how curvy some of the road filming is. At some of the faster speeds, it is a little dizzying to me. Of course, this dvd beats running staring at a blank wall and is meant for bikes, but I think I would feel the same on a bike."
1,Not what I expected,"The written description & the photo on front cover suggests the scenery will focus on ocean views but the main views include roads (complete with yellow lines!) with weeds and a few palm trees on both sides. It felt more like a car ride than a bike ride. Maybe 5 seconds of ocean views. I was so disappointed. Hawaii has so many BEAUTIFUL beaches they could have included. On a positive note, Amazon made the return extremely simple."
2,Fell apart in a week,My son still plays with this toy even though he has brought me about five pieces of it that he has pulled off of it just with normal play. Probably better to collect than to play with.
1,Flawed Mounting Mechanism Mars Product,"I like OXO products for their generally well-designed traits. Unfortunately, this oven thermometer is the exception to OXO quality and design. The thermometer is fairly accurate in its temperature reading, and the temperature numbers on the dial are easy to read when backlit by the oven lightbulb (if you have one). What makes the product totally flawed and worse than useless is the ridiculously idiotic mounting mechanism -- two metal clips on each side of the device, which are so short, they won't even lock onto my oven rack, and keep making the thermometer fall off the rack. It's the essence of stupid design, just plain stupid. Also, when the thermometer is in place (assuming that you can actually get it to stay in place), it takes up several inches of space on the rack, preventing you from sliding an oven pan all the way towards the back of the oven.Go with a hanging thermometer instead and save yourself a lot of frustration."
1,Not even close,"Off by at least 100 degrees f. Based on three uses, the calibration looks like it shifts between uses, so it's not consistently off by the same amount. Junk."
1,Registers 100 degrees too high,"Since I have many OXO items in my home, I thought that the OXO oven thermometer would also be good. Boy was I wrong! When the oven beeped to say that it had reached its temperature, the thermometer didn't read anywhere near what it should read. It took about 20 minutes for the thermometer to finally read what the oven temp was set at. Then, to make things worse, the OXO thermometer started registering at least 100 degrees above what we set the oven for. I have since bought a cheaper but reliable thermometer name which is registering just fine. In the meantime, I've had to recalibrate my oven several times to make up for the drastic readings the OXO gave me. Sorry I ever bought it to begin with."
2,Just ok,"It's accurate and clips nicely to the rack, but it's very difficult to read -- even when I placed it with the oven light behind ... The Kitchen Aide oven thermometer is much clearer."
1,Poor design,"I have many Oxo kitchen items, and they are well-designed tools. I was therefore excited to see that Oxo has an oven thermometer, since I do a lot of baking and needed to check the accuracy of the oven temperature. I am sad to say that this item does not live up to the Oxo name.The thermometer appears to measure the temperature properly. However, the clip-on apparatus is poorly designed. If the rack to which the thermometer is attached is bumped even gently, the thermometer pops off and falls onto the oven floor. Having retrieved and reattached the thermometer numerous times, I give up. I will be returning this item."
3,not the usual oxo perfection,"The ""hook"" to hang or stand the thermometer in the oven is not substantial enough and the thermometer frequently falls or gets knocked over."
2,"Takes forever to register the temp, dial clouded over.......","Two issues:1. Takes forever to show the actual oven temp, even after pre-heating the oven...say 10 minutes, or more.2. After using mine for about two years it is impossible to read the temp due to the clouded over dial.There are better choices. Normally OXO products are excellent but not this one."
2,WAY too slow registering temp,"Although I love the way it clips onto the oven rack, and it's VERY easy to read, it took about 15-20 minutes to ""register"" the temperature of the oven."
1,100 degrees off what it should have been,"The OXO thermometer I purchased was to replace a cheap grocery store version I'd been using. Nice concept, but mine was grossly inaccurate. My oven runs between 17 and 25 degrees below what it should be, not the 100+ degrees indicated by the OXO unit."
3,"Stays in place well, accurate, but a bit hard to see in a dark oven","Love the base of this thermometer. My old one was always tipping over as I moved things around in my old (circa 1964) oven. This thermometer seems to be dead on accurate, which is what I was primarily interested in. One drawback is that the dial is more transparent than it appears in the photos, and in a dark, unlit oven like mine, it is a bit hard to see when it is in the rear of the oven."
5,saw it twice,"The film started out like the usual slasher flick, but then turned 180 degrees. Instead of looking at the scary external threat, it looked inwards at the teenage girls themselves - their fears, tortured friendship politics, sexuality and so on. Kind of ambitious, but the acting was a revelation, down to split-second facial expressions that gave away the insecurity, longing and occasional resentment beneath the old-friends-hangin'-out exterior. This a subtle story, with a lot of meat for late-night discussions of social/parental influences and how they shape everything from our self image to our attitudes towards the opposite sex and the way we react to unfamiliar/scary situations. Apart from being fresh and really unique, it certainly makes you look more closely at your friends' eyes to make sure they're not hiding something from you!"
1,Not my cup of tea.,This movie was not my cup of tea. I would choose something else. Do not waste time watching this movie.
1,Not even worth the one star,"From the first 5 minutes you could tell how the film was going to unfold. The girls are insecure in who they are and of course like most high school girls they are ready to stab each other in the back whenever possible because three's a crowd. One girl is over sexualized while the others aren't. Another reviewer said it well when they said this was a good movie for 17 year old boys who might want some insight into the minds of high school girls (FYI, this isn't what it''s really like guys). The things that the girls have happen to them are things that they bring on themselves and for one of them it is the stuff of demented fantasies that she probably wishes would happen.You want a good movie? Go watch House of 9 or Thirst. Don't waste your time here and don't give 3 teenage girls a gun when they have no idea how to use it."
2,Couldnt get into this,"I see 3 other reviewers really enthused with this one. I didn't have that experience. I like the actors but the extended comedy wasnt to my taste. It was doing the 'wacky', hammy angle Indian Bollywood comedy lovers love. I like more subtlety in my humour.It is aging too (it looks older than 1997). Now I can live with this if the plot redeems it (and I have liked other Aamir Khan offerings of this period) but I found myself all too aware of the dodgy movie colour and the echoing in the audio track.My 28 year old co-enthusiast of Bollywoods abandoned it earlier than me. I resolutely held in there because of the cast but this one didn't do it for me.A quick Net surf shows it is often rated about 5-7 out of 10 elsewhere. So be aware there can be a range of reactions to it."
2,Haier vs Koldfront,I just want to say that I have an 18-20 bottle capacity Haier which I have had for five years this month. It is not digital and the temp adjustment is in the back but I only have to change it with the seasons and use a thermometer inside--my top shelves for red are holding always at 60 and the bottom two shelves for white are holding at 56. I am looking for a bigger capacity unit but after reading these reviews I may just keep what I have and possibly get an additional Haier.
3,"Decent product, decent service","I reviewed this once before complaining that the plastic door frame came broken and my emails to the manufacturer and the dealer got no productive response. Yesterday a package arrived with a replacement door. Great; this solves my problem. The wine cooler is adequate. It is billed as a 28 bottle cooler but is really 16 bottles. To get the 28 in there requires shoving each bottle tightly under shelves and making sure you have small bottles. It conveniently fits 4 bottles per shelf with 4 shelves, assuming one bottle on each shelf is thin. While not quite what the description says, this works for me. It's a decent product for the price if you don't mind the plastic door frame and you are satisfied getting 16 bottles in there. The energy efficiency is excellent."
5,great buy,"Bought for my boyfriend for christmas and it was very simple to put together, looks great, great price, and arrived earlier than what I thought. We are still enjoying it. Very nice cooler."
3,Not as Quiet As Expected,"We purchased this unit a few months ago. It works well, but it is not as quiet as we were led to believe. It makes a constant humming sound that we have gotten use to. We thought that it would be essentially silent. We were wrong."
1,totally caput after 1 year,"thought this was going to be a decent unit, but like several others, cooler died after just over 1 year. would definetely not purchase again. gotta be a piece of junk to only last a year. by the way, ordered product from Compact Appliance like another reviewer...won't be buying anything from them again. good luck to anyone who has this unit."
1,Short Life,"This 28 bottle Wine Cooler from Edgestar has a short expected life. Mine died after 22 months of service, set-up in a living room with constant temperature (thus not subject to large temperature swings). I am used to refrigerators lasting at least 15 years, and cannot accept such a short life. What a waste of money, and extra pollution as we now need to discard this useless appliance!Since all three fans were still working, I replaced the circuit board, which brought the unit back to working condition for only one day. What a waste!"
3,"Full-on drum&bass, but nothing remarkable!","This album is a disappointment for all Wire- and Newman-fans, who like Colin's typically British understated way of singing. Further, is an uneven, thrown-together collection of drum&bass-tunes with some rocky guitar-sounds. There are some interesting songs here, but Colin has done this much better on his clubby ""Immersion"" and ""Oracle"" releases.I'm a bit surprised to see that the US issue of this album only contains a single disc. ""Bastard"" was released throughout Europe as a double-CD-set, including the fantastic ""Voice""-EP, which was previously only available on vinyl! This EP comprises four songs, alternating between futuristic techno-pop and gentle ambient, and offers a far better example of Newman's sound."
4,"Trance-dance is not for everyone, but...","...I have always liked it. Being a Wire and Colin Newman fan, I had to hear this. And while it is not much like his other work, I found it worthwhile. If you've heard and liked Seefeel, for example, you will probably like this.Repetitive riffs dominate. Some reviewers have called this dance music, but I wouldn't physically dance to this, nor expect to hear it in a dance club. But the hook-like samples, slowly evolving background, and interesting percussion can make the mind dance. There are no vocals, but I didn't miss them.Again, not everyone's cup of tea, but mine and maybe yours if you like listening attentively."
5,A DELIGHTFUL REPAST,"In a CD compilation of chamber works by Telemann, Handel and Bach, where the onus rests on various flute permutations and combinations, jaded or, worse, dull performances can easily bore one to tears. Luckily, this is not the case here. Instead we are treated to the warmth and breadth of these baroque compositions, some familiar, others not, but all played with the utmost sense of the moment, and caught faithfully, and gorgeously, by Chesky engineer, Bob Katz. Hats off to flutist Schocker's mesmerizing tonal range, expressiveness and insight. Praise, as well, to Mr. Schocker's fine ensemble, with a special nod to cellist Ted Hoyle whose ever-present ""voice"" adds substantial emotional impact.[Running time: 62:18]"
2,Bad Old Bach,"It's performances like these that give baroque performance a bad name. How many of these graceless, metronomic performances have we all suffered through? The cello is ridiculously prominent, as if it has its own mike and wants to be a solo instrument."
2,Outdated trail guide,"I was disappointed with this guide book. The book was published in 1988, which means there is nothing about GPS in the book. I found the organization of the book to be confusing. The guide has maps of some of the trails, but they are hard to read and there is no map that provides a big picture view of the trails. Information about many trails in the Gila Wilderness is available, but would be more useful with an easy to find section providing information about each trail such as length, elevation changes, connecting trails, water availablity, etc. Several trails are cited as connecting to included trails, but no other information is provided."
3,More Than A Single,"I love any band where buying the singles is like getting a whole new album. I'm sure I don't need to tell you what Underworld is all about; if you're looking up a single, you're familiar with the band. Trust me, you won't regret buying this. In addition to the album version of ""Pearl's Girl,"" it contains eight tracks that bear no resemblance to the single, even the remixes. I think the standouts are ""Puppies,"" which is an odd, almost Godspeed-You-Black-Emperorish kind of thing (though more upbeat), and ""Deep Arch,"" which doesn't change much over its eight minutes of running time but, like most Underworld, has a great, ambient, city-at-night feel; a soundtrack for driving on just the right kind of evening.This ain't gonna convert the unconverted, but for fans it's a solid buy."
5,Beware the CHERRY PIE,"This song alone makes the CD worth purchasing. As someone else reviewing the CD said, Underworld is producing the most love-infused music in any genre of music today - if you ever just once open yourself to listen to one of their songs and hear the subtleties, the fade-ins, the gradual melodic changes, and the climaxing, its a spiritual moment not to be believed. If you like Underworld, you will absolutely LOVE this CD, and especially CHERRY, a song so touchingly-crafted, you really have to wonder how they are SO consistently successful at creating the music they do."
2,nogo dobre:)),"znachi , nogo e gotino ima yako chalga obache se chudya zasho kondyo ne izpylnyava vokalite?"
3,"Idiosyncratic, but worthy, experimental EP","Underworld's PEARL'S GIRL, a nine-track EP released in 1996, forms a bridge behind the previous album, SECOND TOUGHEST IN THE INFANTS, and their 1998 breakthrough BEAUCOUP FISH. Although an EP, PEARL'S GIRL features over an hour of music, often odd, sometimes captivating, and always energetic.The EP features four versions of the title track ""Pearl's Girl."" The edit and album versions are the best, featuring the wild vocals of Karl May. The ""Tin There"" and ""14996 Version"" mixes are much more dancey, and lack vocals. The various other tracks are okay. ""Cherry Pie"" is perhaps the best. ""Deep Arch"" makes no sense whatsoever.Just about as good as BEAUCOUP FISH, but at the price of an EP, PEARL'S GIRL offers some good tunes."
2,Un Osito Para Miguelito,"If you believe that war, poverty and brutality are appropriate topics for third-graders, this is the book for you. And there may very well be Salvadoran parents who wish to introduce the subject of that country's civil war to their children. The book is nicely illustrated, and I can't take issue with the writing on any technical basis. But seriously, the disclosure that Miguel was ""hurt by soldiers. Now he can't run and play anymore,"" is a bit much for an eight-year-old, in my opinion."
1,AR-15,This was a waste of money. If you are interested in learning about proper shooting techniques go to a certified class. Many of the things Lenny talks about are not correct and misleads you into thinking they are.
3,they didn't live up to my expectations,like i only liked falling down cuz it fills the opening slot for my metal cd mix like i love that song but i guess im not punk...
5,Awsome group!,"Bigwig is incredible! They are true punk. Favorite tracks are Still, Dent, Smile, Falling Down, and Sellout. All the songs rock though. If you are fans of dogwood, ghoti hook, toxic narcotic, and the ataris, you should like these guys. Also check out Toxic Narcotic, Lost Cause, and The Vandals as well. Pure punk mayhem. Words can't describe the excellence of this CD. A must buy!"
4,Classic Rock Revival,"Definitely agree with the John Mellencamp/Van Morrison analogy. It's great to see this type of music around again, as it has been missing for too long, and is reminiscent of the greats like Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.There are some great rock numbers like ""American Sound"" and ""Boys Alright"", and ""Cari's Song"" then moving on to more soulful tunes like the beautiful ""I wonder"", a foot-tapping masterpiece that will keep you listening for hours and hours.Brilliant Album!"
4,Good solid info,This is the first Buffy reference book that I have read and I have to say that I enjoyed it.I found it to be very detailed.The thing I enjoyed most was the complete listing of every song by every band that was played in every episode.It also provided the names of the cds the songs were on.I thought that was a nice touch. I discovered some good music from that.I think all Buffy fans would find this book worthwhile.
3,"Good, but not Great","It was good in the sense that, like the first edition, has sort of a biography of how ""Buffy"" came to be. It takes you step by step of the making of the original ""Buffy"" movie all the way to the seventh season. And like the first edition, it has a biography of the cast and characters - revised and updated - and the episode guide. It was good in the way that when you read various episodes, the author had included little notes and things about various demons and/or witches. It also has a brief history of the vampire, going from Anne Rice's version of the average vamp to Bram Stoker's vamps to even a few myths of them. That was what made it good.It would've been great, however, if the author included all of Season Seven. The total episodes in the series is 144. The author only included 131 episodes. Whether or not she had a deadline, I don't know, but it would've been nice to see all the episodes included."
1,Pass this one up,"If you're looking for a well written, informative, insightful book on Buffy then keep looking. This book is extremely poorly written and poorly edited as well. The analysis is weak and juvenile. It reads like someone's poorly written high school review. There is also not enough focus on the actual plot of each episode. I would definitely not recommend it unless you're desperate to own every Buffy book out there. I was deeply disappointed."
3,"Good Book, but it lies","This is a good book and it give alost of intormation on the background of vampires, but the episode guide is a little short, and only covers the first 3rd of season 7."
1,"Cheap, Cheap !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Inferior product and not true to size. XL more like a Medium. Got my money back.
2,Not worth buying,"Very disappointing. DVD was not of a good standard. There are alot of black screens, black screens with no sound, black screens with sound. Sorry I would not recommend this particular DVD to anyone."
2,"An excellent movie however the recordind was very, very bad!.","An excellent movie.. however the recordind was VERY VERY BAD!. A re-pack dvd, the video was dark, worst quality than the worst youtube low resolution recordings. The outfit that puts this dvd productions, has no shame... There is no Artwork on the face of the dvd, no information about the product. The dvd begins, by missing recorded words, like someone began recording seconds after the movie began. To add insult to injury, the dvd arrived late, and was found to be the wrong dvd. After having to send it back, at ""Amazons expense"", the correct dvd arrived 4-days after. Amazon should look into the way this outfit repackage dvd's. As for me, I had better luck looking in ""used small dvd local stores"". This will be my ""last old-dvd purchase""."
1,What a ripoff,"Disc claims to be published by Mad Phat Enterprises. What a ripoff, it won't even play. I'll pay a lot more attention to the reviews from now on. Hope people read this one so they won't be suckers."
3,"very thrilling,keeps you glued to your screen. Bravo!","I first caught this made for direct to video gem on cable in 1990. I was not expecting what was eventually delivered by this film. The acting was first rate, and I was kept in suspense during the entire film. Ms. Gracen turns in a stellar performance. There is no signs of her former Miss.America connection in this sexy, dark suspense/thriller. She certainly established herself in my book as a seriously underated actress.This film is certainly worth a look."
2,Horrible!,"I've been looking for a good recording of Cage's 'First Construction' (in metal)' and having liked some of Mr Knaacks other percussion interpretations I decided to get this CD.Mistake! At first I thought there was something wrong with my sound system so I checked and everything was fine. I took the CD out wiped it down and tried to play it again but it still sounded 'wrong.'On closer inspection this CD is horribly recorded, horribly mixed and horribly performed. Example: the thundersheets are distorted, have a 'sproingy' sound and sound like someone slamming the door to an old shed.The relative levels of each of the percussion instruments is so bad it's almost comical.For a very nice recordings of Cage's 'Second Construction' and 'Third Construction' pick up the New Music Consort's interpretation on New World Music.Stay away from this CD! :("
3,Too Sticky,This is a great ball. Very large and easy to catch and throw. But my kids will not play with it because they do not like the stickiness of the ball. Plus it pulls my daughters hair when it hits her head due to the stickiness.
5,CLASSIC MASTERPIECE!!,"I won't write a review detailing the plot, that has already been done here. This movie is a masterpiece. The child actors are sensational, the directing superb. Even the musical score is hauntingly beautiful (Jeux Interdits by Narciso Yepes.....I bought the song off itunes for my ipod.)I read a review by Roger Ebert (he gave it a stunning review, of course) and he said it is not a tear-jerker. I disagree, the last scene made me cry....that lovely little girl Paulette calling out for Micel, with tears welling in her eyes....how can you not break down watching that? I am getting emotional just writing about it now.The DVD is loaded with wonderful extras, including an alternate ending, interviews, etc...All I can say is that this is one of the greatest films OF ALL TIME. You simply must see it. a CLASSIC MASTERPIECE. BRAVO!!!!!"
5,Very educational DVD,This Dvd is wonderfully done! Throughout the first portion the moves are gone over very slowly at an easy pace for you to grasp everything! At the end(once you have mastered all of the exercises)you can go through it all without verbalization in a freeflowing atmosphere! A must have for your relaxation and inner strength building collection !
3,THERE IS NO CARMEL POPCORN,I loved this product when it was in my local grocery store but as usual when I find an item I liked they discontinue it. Well to my surprise I found it here on Amazon. But it no longer contains any carmel popcorn and that was one of the best parts. It states it so on this advertisement but it isn't listed on the packages and doesn't contain any inside.
1,Do Not Order This In The Summer!!!,I just now received my order from UPS. I was home when it was deliveded and when I opened the box I discovered that everything was all melted into one clump from the heat. All 12 packages are now worthless!!! This is not a good food product to be sending through the mail during hot summer months!!!
2,Decent price but what a mess...,Loved picking these packs up from travel centers while on the road and was delighted to find them available on Amazon for such a great price. Sadly the yogurt raisins had all melted and clumped together with everything else....the peanut brittle was also melted partially. Huge clumps in each bag instead of trail mix...what a mess. It wasn't even summer/hot weather (hear anyway). Buyer beware.
2,Disappointed,The photos are in black and white! and such poor quality that I can hardly make out what they are. The poetry is lovely. Why do such a cheap printing job?
5,Another Kumon winner,My 3 and 5 years olds love all the Kumon books and amazing mazes is no exception. My 3 year old started with the first Kumon tracing book and her writing skills are great. I can highly recommend Kumon.
4,interesting set of standards,"mr. haynes continues to be a part of jazz's elder statesmen making tremendous performances of late (see also max roach/clark terry's ""friendship"" or keith jarrett's ""up for it."")this collection of standards recorded by the japanese 88 label and picked up by columbia is a superb album. the ensemble swings with abandon and finds new twists and turns in very familiar tunes. mr. haynes leads the charge laying down a consistent groove on drums. he shows again and again how these songs are love letters, not only in their own content, but in the message the band conveys to the listener. this is well worth having."
4,Rufus wainwright,"I ordered this cd because I wanted a copy of Halleilugha by Rufus wainwright. I wanted to use it for yoga classes. Some of the songs will be ok for class , but not all of them. the collection is songs are beautiful and uplifting so I will enjoy the cd anyway."
2,Vulgar Trash,"Not worth watching. I threw mine in the trash rather than selling it on eBay. It is pornographic in places, vulgar in theme and simply not worth any quality time."
3,Once is never..never on my DVD player!,"I bought it for my son as a Christmas present. The DVD content is great, but it will not play on our dvd or Blu-ray players, it is a PAL version. Product page says all regions but we can only watch it on the computer, which limits it's usefulness."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic artist and great album, do yourself a favour and buy it. Voice is very similar to his brother Greg Perry but he is a tremendous artist in his own right."
4,"great guide to things to do, good rural atlas","This atlas shows nearly every back road in the state of Pennsylvania, with all the state route numbers and many of the names. It does not have much detail on the cities, only the major roads. It's also not much use for looking up country addresses, unless you happen to know the road number, rather than the name. The gazetter is great, however. It lists all the private campgrounds in the state, amusements, excursions, spectator sports, some stuff on the Amish, some wineries, unique natural features, all the state parks and forests, botanical gardens, senic drives, skiing, some canoeing, some hiking, some covered bridges, some bike routes, tons of museums and historic sites, tons of golf corses, lots of fishing, and lots of hunting sites. A great guide to the state"
5,diode replaced with higher spec model,"I gave this review 5 stars to counter the 1 star reviews, based on the information below.I just chatted with a Tripplite customer service agent who told me two things:a) the devices with the problematic diode have been recalled and Tripplite replaced the diode with a higher rated modelb) all new units have the higher rated diodeI just ordered one of these; I guess I'll know in 3 years if the diode has really been fixed."
1,"Primary Failed, Secondary Works (but for how long...?)","I have one of these myself & can confirm that the D55 diode is burnt out as well. Unfortunately, pursuant to a chat I had with Tripp Lite in the last week, there's nothing they can do, or at least nothing they are willing to do. Unless I can find another power board (mfg 660802LFA1), and assuming I can replace this on my own, I have no other options.I will say this: The folks I spoke with at Tripp Lite were very helpful and courteous. While I cannot advise/recommend/suggest purchasing these PDU's (especially at $450 a pop!), I want to believe Tripp Lite will take care of you for things that still fall within their warranty period."
1,Doesn't work,"This thermometer came with no indications on what may touch the probe. If you rest the top portion of the probe on anything, or just leave art of it exposed, you get a false reading. Even if you sink it totally in the meat, you get a false, high, reading. It just does not work."
1,Not a good product,I wish I would have read the product reviews before I bought this item. My delivered unit was not like the one pictured as others experienced. I found out it was faulty during its first use when it read that the chicken I was cooking was less than 140 degrees (the units lowest marking) after 25 minutes. My digital thermometer (known to be accurate) read the meat at 180 degrees! OXO is a NOGO.
2,Not my favorite,I handwashed this one time and it filled up with water. I didn't expect to be able to wash it in the dishwasher but I also didn't expect it to fill 45% up with water the first time I washed it by hand. The water has since evaporated but I haven't tried to use the thermometer since and I won't use it without using a second one to calibrate this one to see if it is anywhere close to accurate. Not exactly what I was looking for.
5,GREAT CD!,"I went to listen to Chosen-Few in concert and ever since I have been in love with them.. This CD is GREAT! I listen to it in the car, by myself, on a trip.. Its a great CD.. Chosen-Few made this CD a great success... I really recommend this.."
5,Very Reliable,"The book was old and was very difficult to find, so I was very happy to have found it with this provider. The product arrived in a timely fashion and its condition was as described. The price was reasonable. I am satisfy with this provider and would consider purchasing from them again."
5,The best fairytale anthology to date!,"From her personal introduction to the universally applicable final comments, Kate Ragan's book is a rich and enlightening feast for my heart. The tales are diverse and wonderfully illustrative of both the cultures they derive from and the resourcefulness of their heroines. The book has no undercurrent of anger or vindictiveness and deals compassionately (and with some amusement) with difficult relationships. I have a large collection of various fairytale anthologies; this is by far the best of the genre."
5,"Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters","Great short stories! It is a wonderful read for myself, my daughter(8) and my son(4). Both children enjoy the colorful idioms and the tales!"
2,The stories were better off without Ragan.,"The collection is nice. It introduced me to folktales I've never read anywhere else. The ""precious"" little commentaries made by the author after each piece are irritating and pc-preachy. I can come up with my own interpretation of a tale without her telling me what to think, thank you very much."
4,Solid A,I loved this book and wanted to order numerous copies of it for gifts to give to mother's of baby girls.The book arrived quickly and was in fine condition as it had been described.
2,commend Ragan's effort but disappointed,"I appreciate Ragan's effort to go out and gather the diverse collection of stories but I have to agree with a lot of the criticism by ""very, very disappointing"" dated Sept. 24, 1999. In her attempt to counter the lack of female heroines she creates another imbalance. Women, just like men, are flawed and even the best and greatest can make mistakes. Also, her comments at the end of each story are unnecessary. She should let the readers glean for themselves what is most meaningful. Also, I'm assuming she re-wrote some of these stories. And, if so, her re-writing of some of them lacks a certain flow. There are some areas that are choppy and I found myself stumbling through sentences (while reading aloud to my children) due to the lack of punctuation."
2,Actually pretty boring to read straight...,"This book is split up into sections by location containing folk and fairy tales with women heroines. While I had some favorites ""The Three Sisters and Their Husbands, Three Brothers (Ireland), Little Red Cap (Germany), The Pigeon's Bride (Yugoslavia), The Innkeeper's Wise Daughter (Jewish-American) and How Parvatibai Outwitted the Ducoits (Makarashtra, India), I found lots of the other stories to be confusing, boring or both. It might be good book if you are really into the topic or need to do some research, but not great for pleasure reading."
2,Too much anti-men feminism,"I understand Kathleen Ragan's problem with the lack of female heroines in the more accepted fairy tales. This does not, however, mean that I will condone her constant bashing of the tales that were my favorites as a child. The cute little comments at the end of each story pointing out why or why not it is a good and feminist story detract from the magic of the tales themselves and are a gross annoyance. If one wants equality, one should create a volume of stories in which heroes and heroines share the spotlight, not a male bashing one like this book."
2,THE END OF A GREAT BAND,"All good things must come to a end .. Parliament-Funkadelic has been hot for so long previous to this album release in 79.. I guess Clinton say it coming .. the material here is very lame, boring with the exception of what i think is the baddest jam ever Knee Deep and the funky title cut .. there isnt nothing else left on this album.. Check out all the albums previous to this one and Electric Spaking of War Babies avoid this one also .."
5,The greatest FUNK record ever!!,"If you don't have this CD, something's wrong with you-----it's the best Funk Cd ever in the history of the world----you will be dancing as soon as you hear it!!! You can't go wrong with this one!!!!"
4,How To Attract Money,"I have used this tape for five years to relax, go to sleep, and get my mind headed in the direction I want to go. It has worked for me. I am much more successful in my career, and I have been able to greatly improve my financial situation.I have worn out the tape and need a new one. I also have friends who would like copies."
4,Memorable characters will make you laugh,"The memorable characters of this gem of a tale will stay with you for sometime. Their perdicaments are many,their view of the world a little skewed but you will enjoy this romp through Carmel that is like none other that you may have taken or dreamed of. Recommend this as a sure tonic for any thing that ails you!"
4,"Good product, indeed!","These look sexy and aren't too uncomfortable. It's best to tie the strings well, though, to keep them from coming undone when wearing tight jeans.As a bonus, if anyone ever forgets it while they are staring at your crotch, the ""SEXY"" spelled out in rhinestones will remind them of what you are. You can even point to it in reference while you talk about other things."
4,nice little book,"This book has very little to say in the way of instruction, but a good deal of insight into what to ponder when sketching animals. It is also a book that anyone from elementary school to a nursing home could find something in even if they never picked up a pencil."
5,Almost the Entire Recording History,"This CD comes close to offering the ODJB's entire recording history, except for the sides on Columbia, before the RCA recordings, and some of their sides with larger orchestras. Still, this is an outstanding sampling of their music, including the recordings made in l936, when the band got back together for the March of Dimes. It's neat to catch the energy still in the band over these years, even though the recording techniques are so primitive for their earlier sides. They're the pioneers of recorded traditional jazz, and deserve all of their hype. See my review of other ODJB CDS."
1,Would not turn on.,"I ordered one of these but mine had the painted tye dye base. Other than that, everything else was identical (colors, size, and shape). It looked awesome the first few times, I tried it. After that it never turned on again. Some type of problem in the switch or electronics, who knows.I contacted the Lumisource customer service people and they never responded. I guess Lumisource doesn't stand behind their products, they hide.This is unfortunate since this is a cool looking lamp when it works.I star because the darn thing won't turn on any more and I didn't do anything to it."
5,The best choice!,None other compares to the true connection between the cards and the tracks here. Each title compliments the mysticism of the cards and their meanings perfectly. The sequence and triumphs within each are truly brilliant. I have to say this is by far the best choice for complimentary music for the Tarot.
1,what happened here?!?,"Let me first of all state that I LOVE Max Roach's work over the years. He and Clark are legendary! Unfortunately, even legends grow old and their chops fade away. This recording is the worst thing I've bought in recent memory (and I buy a few CDs a week). I couldn't help but feel that I had been taken by Columbia Records with this one. Neither of the leaders are ever close to bringing this session to life. They sound like, well, very old men. To make matters worse the piano and bass player must have fallen asleep in the studio. They are not very supportive on most and nonexistant on other tracks. It seems that the only tracks that held any sort of interest for the players were when max was using brushes. That only accounts for 2 or 3 tracks though. Save your money for some other old men that can still play like Roy Haynes or Elvin Jones. Same age and still able to keep up with the young cats."
5,The Spiritual imperative of grief,"Magaret Wurtele exposes her wounded heart and brings us into her struggle in a way that can only be described as stunning. The writing is honest, spare and captivating, born of the stength of one who obviously knows what she doesn't like in writing, she painstakingly crafts the sentences to allow us to travel through this first year of grieving without obstacles or distactions.Most importantly, Ms Wurtele is honest. Her spiritual path is being crafted beautifully by a force that she dances with,with tenacity, integrity and awe."
5,Newsflash: A worthwhile retrospective,"I can't say enough about this album. It does more than confirm Weingarten's reputation as a terrific slide player. It showcases some of his best compositions from the past 15 years; many are absolutely stunning. By placing them in a new context, it emphasizes how much each has to say.Some of the tracks--especially those from ""Redwood Melodies""--are pretty and have engaging hooks. But Weingarten's greatest tunes (in my humble opinion) seem like expressions of important life moments or conversations. The perceptive observations of the compositions are borne out by his touch--alternately tender and searing--on dobro and slide guitar. They are eloquent moods that draw you in with tasty leads and ornamentations; it's all timed so perfectly, yet it doesn't sound like anyone else's music. (Ry Cooder's film music is the probably the closest thing.)I keep playing this album. Everyone who I play it for likes it."
3,I love this stuff on ice,started drinking it in France (menthe-a-lou) and got hooked. good on ice with some water on a hot summer day.
4,Revisited was accurate,The BNW revisited is like a snapshot of modern civilisation in the 21st century. Was underwhelmed by BNW but the essays in revisited made up for it. If you keep up to date with contemporary commentary it is all really old news but significant I suppose that he envisaged the present scenario from so long ago.
4,Huxley is a genius and near prophet!,"Aldous Huxley wrote this book in 1931. Yet, even now we are seeing the cause-and-effect beginnings of such a hedonistic lifestyle. Huxley produces a work-of-art, though as he admits, it has it's flaws. Brave New World centers itself on a story of a world without morals and absolutes and how its fancy for hedonistic pleasures leads it toward apathy and infantilism. Subsequently, when a so-called Savage is entered into the picture, mearly a young boy with an conscience and morals, he is the talk of the town and the largest voice for freedom from such degradation. Sadly true to our world, Huxley predicts the wave in which mankind seems to desire to move.An amazing book, this one will make your head spin with pictures of what might be, what is, and an ending you may not expect! Read it! I suspect you'll enjoy it."
5,Extremely Complex Theme,"After reading this book one must think who is correct, John ot the inhabitants of the Brave New World. One can say that it is a false happiness that the people of Brave New World feel but how can you condemn them if it is the greatess happiness they have ever known or felt. John bleieves true happiness must be accomplished after one has suffered and fought for their own happiness instead of having it handed it to them. It raises the question; If you could be permanently hooked connected to wires that would make you have endless pleasure and happiness for the rest of you life would you? Even if it meant you would be strapped into a chair for the rest of your life? After reading this book the question should be re-evaluated. Personally I disagree with John and I would sit it that chair."
4,"A serious, intellectual book.","I would reccomend this book to a serious reader who is looking for intellectual stimulus. It is not a science fiction thriller, and if you are not prepared to consider challenging ideas, I would not. ""Brave New World"" discusses a negative utopia where humans are slaves to thier ""conditioning"" or a pavlovian effect used to control them. All their wants are fulfilled but in reality they are no more than biological inanamate objects. What makes this book so impressive is that was written in 1931, but predicts many modern human developments including mass media and ""the invasion of privacy"", biological engineering, and mood-altering drugs."
1,Book for school,I had to purchase this book for english class at San Antonio College. I am just glad that it is over.
5,EXcellent,This was required reading in college and just thought I'd get it out and review it. It is more meaningful today than it was then. I would reccommend it to anyone in school or out. I graduated college in 1959!
3,No Ted Bundy!,"Readers who like their serial killers to be charming, cunning monsters will be a little disappointed with Harvey Glatman. A nerdy TV repairman with a taste for bondage photography, Glatman was essentially a rapist who murdered his victims almost as an afterthought. Author Newman reports that Glatman regularly scored high on IQ tests, which puzzles this reader, since at no point in this narrative does the killer display an ounce of intelligence (at the time of his arrest two of his victim's bodies hadn't even been found, so whiz-kid Harvey helpfully leads the police to the corpses). Newman is a skillful writer, but there's little of interest in the last 200 pages of this book."
2,Don't bother ...,"I have read a lot of true crime, and I found this to be one of the duller, more forgettable offerings. First of all, the subject Harvey Glatman is not terribly interesting either as a personality or as a murderer. Second, the book was overly long for the volume of information contained; the second 1/3 - 1/2 is pretty much a rehash of the first part, with no new information coming forth. Best about the book: Glatman, as a true-crime genre subject, is a bit refreshing and even oddly likable insofar as he's not into sadism, and such murders as he committed were (to him) an unpleasant necessity for avoiding punishment in his misguided search for pretty much straight sex."
5,Worth the read!,"I am kind of surprised by some of the other reviews here. I found Rope about Harvey Glatman to be one of the most interesting books about real crime. First, the crimes are done in the 1950s in Southern California. He was no Ted Bundy because he at least went quietly to his death. He was the only child of older parents who never really understood him at all. His crimes start early and escalate into murder. He almost got away with it until one woman was smart enough to escape his capture. Rope is written with a lot of detail in explaining culture, society, and how Harvey was raised and his adulthood. We will never really know why Harvey got his thrills from tangling a rope around the neck of his victims and watching him to die. We can understand after his death, that his mother, Ophelia Gold Glatman never even went to claim his ashes at San Quentin. I think this book is very well written and interesting to read over again."
4,good.,I have read several true crime books and rate this one highly. A lot of transcript from original files are included. A good writing style that flows nicely. Material not found in most true crime was presented here.
2,"An interesting case, but kindof a tacky book",This an interesting case. Glatman was a serial killer before the term was invented. But the autor's treatment of the subject felt a little slimy. Describing a rape and murder victim's breasts in detail is un-necessary to the story and is pretty creepy.
5,nutcracker,"The OXO nutcracker is, by far, the best nutcracker we have owned. My wife ts thrilled that she no longer pinches her hand when cracking walnuts. I would highly recommend this product to everyone."
1,smashed fingers,Not a good nutcracker for large hands. When the nut breaks (usually explosively) your fingers can get crushed too. Ouch!
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I wanted to like this thing; I really did. But, simply put...I don't like the device. I don't expect to crack any seafood any time soon & it really seems more suited for seafood cracking. I just wanted something more sturdy for the nuts but this thing is just ""too much"" apparatus for nuts. I found it to be rather awkward to use and it's kind of heavy. I make do with it but I miss the other traditional type of nut cracker only they tend to break at some point. Oh, well."
4,good for small nuts,The wide handles make it easy to crack small nuts without hurting your hands. It does not work very well for large nuts since you tend to increase the pressure and when the shell cracks you mash it to a pulp.For large nuts I suggest the Zyliss model. Having both of these you will be more than a match for any nut.
4,Seafood/Nut cracker,A bit too rough on some nuts you have to be gentle. But seems sturdy and like it will last a long time.
1,A disappointment,"I loved the earlier CD, Reiki, The Light Touch, so I was looking forward to this.I was disappointed to find out that 3 of the 9 cuts were basically worse arrangements of melodies from that earleir CD, with more melody snippets embedded in other cuts.I also found the sitar and vocals to be overused and not that peaceful.I cannot recommend this CD. if you have Reiki, The Light Touch, it's redundant. If not, you should get that CD instead of this one."
2,Unfortunately this is boring,"I have two other of Mirabel's Workout DVDs. I love her Easy Stretch DVD and her Skeletal Fitness DVD. I use each several times a week. However, the Easy Aerobics is so boring I have only used it twice. I purchaced this to workout at home on days the weather was too bad to go outside and walk. Fortunately we have great weather in North Texas. This workout is marching up and marching back then stepping sideways and lifting your arms up and down and back and forth. Yawn! It also could use better music. I'll be searching for a different aerobic workout."
5,Great for overweight people.,I am quite a bit overweight right now and had ordered some Firm dvd's to start a workout program. I can do the Firm's sculpting dvd's that I purchased but the cardio workouts are just too fast paced and complicated for me at this time. I ordered Easy Aerobics and love it. It is very easy to follow and at my weight I felt is was a good workout......made me break a sweat. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is overweight and just starting a workout routine.
3,Easy workout for women over 50.,Easy workout that burns calories and increase heart rate. Great forstarting to exercise again if you have been inactive for a while.
3,could have been great,"This exercise routine would be really great but falls short in one major area. Anyone familiar with aerobics classes know the step sequences always begin on the first beat of the musical eight count, not the second or third as on this dvd. Most of Miribai's routine is awkward and irritating to follow because of this. Too bad the sound mixer didn't pick up on this and coordinate the music. Could have been great."
1,Disgusted,"Make no mistake, the contents of the disc are fine! The workout is acceptable and what I expected--so I am happy with that. The disc quality, however, has been lacking. Most people would have returned it. I, however, have found that by polishing the disc (in this contraption I have that is supposed to help with scratches) each time I use it, it has become more reliable. And, it is not that it arrived scratched. Something, however, was definitely wrong because I have never had a problem with a new disc on either of my dvd players."
1,Watch out for the arms!,"The arms are awful. Unless you have your arm in the groove so that's in the exact straight position so that your entire forearm lines up in the groove (impossible if you're typing for instance) then the edge of the arm bites into your forearm. After about five minutes, it hurts. If you are planning on using the chair for work, I wouldn't recommend it. Who designed these arms? Yo Office Star, just put normal flat and beveled arms on this thing before you hurt any more people."
5,fits my lumbar exactly!,"Arrived quickly...assembly was a snap. The only 'con' is the armrests are angled poorly for me, but the chair is otherwise perfect for my back and long hours at the computer."
4,Great chair with one draw back,"Comfortable chair, easy to assemble, soli construction.... but arms interfer with my desk when at comfortable height so that I need to sit on the front of the chair.... (no back support)."
4,Nice chair,"I'm a computer science/software engineering student, so I spend a lot of time at my best. I found this chair to be comfortable, even for long periods of time -- of course, that's just my experience. I wish it had more adjustment options, but that's asking a bit much of a chair in this price range."
4,Good for the price,"I've been using the chair a couple of weeks now and I am definately happy with the purchase. It certainly isn't as comfortable or adjustable as a 1000$ herman miller chair, but this is less than half the money and it is just as stylish (i think). the seat is comfortable and the mesh back gives good support to my lower back. My only complaint is that the armrests could be a little less cheap feeling and at little more comfortably shaped."
4,Great Work chair,For long term work on a computer desk this fits the bill.It has everything I wanted without being over priced.
1,No back support; too solid,Everyone in my office thought this chair was uncomfortable. It doesn't tilt back very far and it's too firm. There is also no back support. I sent it back the day I ordered it.
1,uncomfortable and falls apart after 6 months,"so i thought it was my imagination at first, but people come over to my house and sit in my chair and describe it as a modern torture device.Ive tried many adjustments, adding on pillows and back savers and this thing just continues to jack my back up. It also needs to be tightened seemingly every 30 days. And today i came out and the arm rest is already split after only 6 months, and no ill treatment. I had read some other positive reviews here which had influenced my decision, but obviously those people are out of their minds or work for this company.This is the second most uncomfortable chair i have ever owned despite months of problem solving."
3,It is what it is,"I found a chair very similar to this one at a big box store. I sat in it and it was great, but the price. While I was sitting in the chair I looked online at Amazon and thought this chair looked exactly like the one I was sitting in. Of course my luck it wasn't. It arrived on time. Box was a little damaged, but nothing in the box was damaged. Put the chair together which was not difficult at all and gave it a test drive today. UGH it is terrible for me. Everyone is different, I am only 5'4"" and like to sit fairly straight up at my desk. This chair is just too big for me which makes it uncomfortable for me. Oh well"
3,"Decent comfort, style and looks for price range","I was in need of a simple task chair to replace one at a temporary desk that did not have a decent chair. For the price ($154.00) I paid, this is a decent chair. Not the best; minimal adjustment, mesh backing keeps you cool, and while it isn't uncomfortable I can't imagine being seated in this for hours."
1,Poor packaging,"This item arrived coming through the box. I can't recommend ordering this product to be shipped to you. Another friend ordered one and it came to him undamaged. If you have time to play ""Will this make it or not"" order. If not, I'd say try something else."
1,too tall at lowest setting,"I am a 5'6"" woman, and at the lowest seat height and with my shoes on, I cannot get my feet flat on the floor. It is also a little too deep for me, and the depth cannot be adjusted - there is just one setting.This product, when at it's lowest setting, measures 19 inches from the top of the pad to the floor. Unfortunately, it will cost $40 to return it, so I am stuck with it. Good thing my husband needed a new office chair!It was easy to put together and the webbed back was comfortable, soft, and supportive. It is also nice looking."
4,Knockout Collection,"If you could buy a collection with ""Bad To The Bone"", ""Midnight Rider"", ""Highway Star"", ""Two Tickets To Paradise"", ""We're An American Band"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"" and 24 other great songs, would you? I did, and it's great."
1,Horrible sound!,"I'd give this ZERO stars if I could. This is truly one of the worst sounding reissues I have ever heard. Bessie sounds like she's under water, and the whole thing is so over filtered that it's really hard to listen to. Shame on this company for releasing this awful CD."
5,Simply the Best,"This opener is comfortable to hold, easy to turn and quick to use. The edges are clean, smooth and perfectly safe. I've owned several openers: manual and electric, traditional cutting and smooth edge. This one is the best I've ever used."
2,Don't waste the extra money,"We have been going through quality can opener nightmare lately, every single can opener I buy is junk. In fact the one I bought just because I was at wits end, at the Dollar Tree, lasted longer then many high priced can openers, including this one. I saw this and saw $20 for a can opener? But then I thought I am so over it, I am going to splurge for top of the line. I was very excited about ending the nightmare. About 2-3 weeks later, just stopped working, you could fight with it sometimes and manage to finish opening the can you have partially open, but most the time I had to pull the Dollar Tree one out and struggle through that to get my can open. I am very disappointed in oxo. I have always trusted their products without doubt, now I will look on with doubt on them as well. BTW I think this is my first review, if that tells you how strongly I feel about this lol"
3,Good can opener,"Through my two years of constant use, I have found that the opener does not always open cans quickly and consistently. It works like a charm for some cans - one round of cutting and you are done. Yet for some cans you need to cut a few rounds to open the lids. Frustratingly, quite often (maybe 1 or 2 times out of 10) you just can not open the lids regardless of how many rounds of cutting you apply. I figure that this is probably not due to how strong you grip the can when you cut, it is likely due to the fact that cans from various manufacturers are not sealed uniformly at the top edge for this opener to be effective consistently. The opener is a good nonetheless for specific purposes, such as if you use only a portion of the can and intend to keep the rest in the refrigerator with the lid, or if you simply do not like to have your food touched by cut lids. Otherwise, I keep a swing away opener handy for quicker work."
2,Short life span...,"For 18 months I loved this easy to use opener. Recommended it to everyone in the family. Then it just quit working. It opens part of a can - very frustrating - or doesn't open any of it. There was no gradual build-up to failure, it just quit working. For $20, I expected more. I expected more from Oxo - one of my favorite brands. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did love it so much while it worked...sigh..."
2,works great... while it lasts,"I love this way this can opener works . I even gave some away as gifts. But after about 6 months of not very heavy usage, this can opener can no longer open cans.I have very mixed feelings. It looks, feels and works great but the lack of durability and (relatively) high price makes me suggest you pass on it."
5,Best I've ever seen,"Others have given details. Just let me add that:(1) It is geared to be VERY easy to turn, and . . .(2) The lid can be replaced to reseal the can airtight. (The replaced lid will stay put in the refrigerator, but it doesn't hold tight enough for jostling inside a picnic cooler.)Later: Over the months it becomes a little harder to turn, and the cuts become more shallow, requiring a second trip around the rim. I think this is because some part of the cutting mechanism bends with use. OXO, however, quickly replaced my opener and didn't ask for the old one to be returned. If the same thing happens to this replacement, I'll have to send it back before they'll replace it.All in all, it's still the best can opener I've used, but I suppose I would reduce the rating to 4 stars because of the above faults."
4,I Can Haz Open Cans?,"Great product, but a little difficult to learn initially. Bought this can opener to replace the worst can opener ever, and so far its a great improvement. Once one gets used to the new way of opening, its easy."
5,GREAT CAN OPENER,I HAVE ONE OF THESE CAN OPENERS AND BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE LIKED IT SO MUCH. EASY TO USE AND NO SHARP EDGES.
1,The worse!,I brought this can opener because my mother highly recomended it. I have owned it for two years now and have decided this is the worse can opener I have ever owned. Most of the time I have to go around twice to get the can opened. Some cans it doesn't open at all. I own many Oxo products and am very satisfied with them but this one you can keep.
1,Works about half the time,"I got this can opener when I got married about 2 years ago, thinking it would be a high-quality, long-lasting item. Actually, it works MAYBE half the time. I'm not an idiot...I know I'm using it properly, but I really don't think it is cutting all the way through the metal. Often, after two or three times around the can, I still can't pry the lid off and have had to resort to throwing the can first at the kitchen wall (out of frustration) and then in the trash because there was no way of getting the food out of the can. And then I threw the can opener in the trash as well."
2,POOR PERFORMER,"I purchased my OXO about a year ago and have nothing but problems with it. When it works it works well. The lids come off with no rough edges. However, the opener is difficult to seat correctly on the can; even my wife couldn't figure out the proper way to use it. Most of time, I either can't get a grip on the can with the OXO opener and/or after one or two turns on the handle, the opener loses its grip on the can and then I can't re-establish it. Since I got rid of my old can opener, I have had to resort to using my old c-rations can opener(even that works better). Overall disappointing.....because I love all of my other OXO products."
1,Terrible design,"I bought one of these while looking for a side cutting can opener. It works great for the standard soup can size. However, the handle is mounted on the side which means that when you try to open larger diameter cans with it, the handle bumps into the can and doesn't turn! What's the point of having a replacable lid on your food if the only cans you can do it to are the tiny sizes? Whomever designed this thing should be homeless.Next to useless."
2,can opener,"The smooth edge concept is notable but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The operation of this can opener is awkward and difficult. To lock down the can so the opener can pierce the lid, one has to push the can against a stationary object. Plus the operation of the handles is contrary to standard models and is confusing."
5,Perfect for the elderly or people with pain in their hands,"I received this as a gift years ago but it languished in my drawer for years until my then can-opener gave up the ghost. So then I started using this one and I feel ridiculous that I didn't use it before. It opens cans so easily that you often think, ""Is this even working?"" That was what I thought initially.There is a learning curve because after you open the can, you have to use the attached pincer to remove the lid. But once you understand that it's a quick two-step process, you'll never use another can-opener again. The cans don't leave sharp lids as residue and remove the lip entirely so that there is no need to wash the can beforehand. So it's a time-save in that regard as well.I purchased this one for my parents. Recommended!"
1,didn't last,Purchased this can opener and it broke in less than one month. Maybe it's because we use it a lot and it's not built for heavy use. Now looking for another smooth-edge opener that will last longer than 6 months since the Good Cook and Oxo didn't last.
2,Unnecessarily cumbersome design,"I used one of these for a while and hated it. Having the separator wheels on the bottom makes it a pain to line up correctly, and the two-handle design is awkward. (It did work once it was on there, so I'll give it 2 stars, but it makes a chore out of something so simple...)TheMIU France CanDo Safety Can Openeris WAAAYY better - until it dies. Mine lasted me over 2 years, but reviews for it indicate not everyone has been so lucky.I think I'll try theGood Cook Classic Safe Cut Can Openernext, which seems to have the same design as the MIU."
4,Easy to use if you pay attention.,"I would recommend this opener to anyone who can understand instructions....saw several people trying to use it like a traditional can-opener and getting frustated. When used properly it is easy, relaxing and efficient. Great product, rugged too!"
1,Fails to work properly within several months,I didn't buy this product at Amazon but I know how important these reviews are for prospective buyers. I had all the same problems expressed in other 1-Star reviews after just a few months. I tried to see if the cutter part could be sharpened or replaced but no luck. This can opener cost too much to fail miserably after just a few months. I'll stick with my old reliable Swing Away can opener that I've used for years and cost a fraction of what the OXO Smooth Edge cost.
1,Great for a year. Then worthless.,I loved this can opener when I first got it. It worked great for about a year. Now it just gives me grief. It won't open anything. :([...]
4,Great gadget,"This item is such an improvement over my former can opener, which was the type made from flat steel. This is of the modern design, that cuts the top off, not just inside the lid, but around the outside top of the can. Then the top lifts off, with no burrs on the inside of the can. It works well, but sometimes you have to repeat the effort if the metal is thick-ish. It's new to me, so maybe it just needs more getting-used-to. I'm happy to replace my (probably 30 year old) former can opener with this one."
1,OXO Can Opener,I found this can opener to be very difficult to use. I would go around the can a couple times then have to pull the lid off versus it coming off on its own. I would not recommend this product.
3,"Interesting idea, so-so design.","OXO Good Grips Smooth Edge Can Opener.The best thing that I can say about this can opener is that it is an improvement over the old style jagged edge type of can opener. The opened lid is tight fitting and needs the included pliers to lift off the lid for the first time. The pliers are clumsy to work with and hard to see as they are under the opener. It definitely takes some getting used to. The lid is tight fitting enough to be reused to reseal leftovers for the refrigerator and can be lifted off using your fingers. You can even reopen it by squeezing the sides of the can to make the lid pop open. Overall, a better option is to buy the ""Good Cook Classic 4 In 1 Can Opener""."
1,Broke after two months,"We thought this was a great product, for the two months that it actually worked. We received it on April first, and by June 12th, it was no longer able to open cans."
4,Great kitchen gadget,"My wife has cut herself on spoons in the past, so this little gadget could literally be a life saver. There are other side opening can openers on the market, but this one grabs the can easier, and the little built in pliers are a lot more useful than one would think. A very nice tool."
3,Bulky can opener,"I received this can opener as a gift and love the idea of no sharp edges on the can opener or the cans when opened. But, if you are limited on storage space save $5 and buy Kuhn Rikon'sKuhn Rikon Auto Safety Lid Lifter, RedAuto Safety Lid Lifter which is slimmer but has excellent reviews and color choices. This OXO can opener is bulky and can be a pain to put away in our shallow drawers."
3,note: need to flip over Asian food cans (ex. Chaokoh) to open them,"This can opener is ingenious indeed. It took me several tries before realizing that I needed to flip over some cans that the opener at first seemed unable to open, such as Chaokoh coconut milk. That's why I rated it only 3 stars at first; if I could edit that rating now, then I'd give it 4 stars. Overall the opener does an excellent job in removing lids quickly and safely, though it takes a few tries to get the hang of lifting the cut can lids off against the suction."
1,Frustrating!!,"I hate this can opener. In all fairness, I've decided I don't like any side open(safety)can openers. I can't quickly drain the can contents because the lid won't fit inside the can, so I constantly have to dirty the colander. This is the most frustrating can opener due mainly to the fact that it won't stay on the can edge and the gears are constantly slipping. I have to repeatedly go around the can to completely remove the top and that's not very easy with this opener. Maybe I got a dud, but it's been this way since I got it. So today, after 2 years of putting up with this thing, I am replacing it with the WMF Profi Plus can opener. I can't wait for it to arrive!"
5,Works great,"These work very well. I got these with my wife in mind, the large knob looked like it would work well in a small hand, and it does.It opens the cans very cleanly, with out a hitch. The only down side is that some times you have to pop the lid off with your nails. This is because the opener cuts the lid on the outside edge so there's still some gripping edge. It's not a big deal though."
4,different can opener,This is a good can opener but takes a while to figure it out. Most everyone else in my family loses patience with it. If you stick to it and learn how to work it it is very nice.
4,Great Can Opener,"We've had the good grips smooth edge can opener for a few weeks now and are very, very happy with it. It is very easy to open with and does leave a clean edge. I have not had to fight or struggle with a can yet (as I did with my old ones). I did have to teach my family how to use it as it is different from a standard can opener. Once shown, it's very easy to use."
3,"Good design, bad execution","Need to complete a couple of turns for the can top to come off, but it does so w/out burrs or sharp edges as advertised. Not the easiest model to seat on a can top. The top grabber teeth are gimmicky."
3,Certainly better than traditional can openers,"I purchased this item from another retailer. I made this buy because of the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen.Pros: Smooth, easy action; no sharp edges.Cons: Bulky; difficult to attach to can (though I'm getting better).Summery: Works as advertised."
5,Great product if you have big hands,I love this product! I have rhumatoid arthritis and fairly large hands so it is very comfortable and easy to use.
2,You need to be coordinated,"I decided to get rid of my electric can opener to reduce my carbon footprint and bought this product. I have never been accused of being good with my hands or particulartly coordinated, but this product has been much harder to use than I thought. You have to get just the right angle. I usually have to try several times to get it started. Once it does get going it opens the can really easily."
3,"No sharp edges on the can, but...","Watch out for the edges on the packaging! Given that there is no such thing as good clamshell packaging, this thing came in what is some of the worst I ever encountered. Thick, stiff, fully contoured, lethally edged when cut open. Get a clue, Oxo--ditch the entry-proof plastic.As for the can opener itself, it seems fine, but a full review will have to wait until I get the bandages off my fingers. I guess I can say it will probably work for the handicapped since I could open a can with it just now, but I don't think products for use by the handicapped are actually supposed to turn previously fully functional people into the handicapped. ;) I'd suggest buying some other well-reviewed edge-opening bead-cutting can opener if you have a choice. Unfortunately, none of the pictures of this one showed you'd need a chain saw to get to it when delivered."
3,Smooth Can Opener,A little hard to learn to use. Works as advertised but I'm the only one in the family that will use it.
2,Great when new. Awful later on.,"As other reviews have said, when it's first purchased it works great. I loved it.But after about 3-6 months, it didn't work anymore. I still use it, a year later, but I have to go around 2 times in order to open a can. I'm now searching for a new one to buy. I do not recommend this item."
5,Great product,This really a great product. After some practice it is easy to use. It will hold the lid that has been removed to prevent it dropping down into the can's contents.
2,Hard to use for someone with weak hands,"I bought this because of the large turning handle as I thought it might make it easier to get the lids off of cans, but it wasn't any easier to use than an older style. I've since bought an electric one that cuts the tops of the cans of from Hamilton Beach. It works great!"
2,Too complicated,"There may be people who find this easy to use or who think it's worth the effort to get the kind of edge this produces. For me, it was as the British say ""too clever by half""--you have to hold it exactly right to make it work and keep it going. I got a cheaper one that works a lot better."
2,Great idea with too short a life,"When we received this opener, we loved it. It worked great, and was easy on the hands. We were sick of the ""rechargeable"" batteries in the battery-operated openers lasting only so long, which is why we changed to this human-powered model. We also liked the no-sharp-edges result. It lasted exactly one year, then it began skipping as it wound around the can until it was no longer usable. The warranty isn't as great as it sounds since because of the cost to ship this item back to Oxo; we'll put the money towards a new (and different) opener."
1,disappointed,"Worked well for a short while and then the gears began to strip and now I must go around the can 2 or 3 times before I can get the lid to come off. Also, large cans require me to ""walk around the can"" because they are too heavy for the Oxo to spin them around."
1,Nearly Dead After Just a Year,"I was very pleased with this can opener when I got it, but after just a year, its performance has become hit or miss, sometimes not opening the can at all. Fortunately, I still have my good old traditional can opener, which has worked perfectly fine for at least 25 years--the exact same one--and still works fine."
2,Manual Can Opener,Great looking product - great feel in your hand - worked good for a short while then I had to continue on and on trying to open the same can. All-n-all not too pleased with it.
1,Do not buy this opener,"We first bought one about four years ago and it worked great. Slowly it started to skip and you had to go around the can twice, then three times, then four and finally it stopped working. The grip just does not close enough to make a clean cut. To Oxo's credit, they replaced that one without question. The second one is now only three months old and is failing. We keep an old fashion opener around, which is thirty years old and has never failed. We like the idea of the lid remover over the can opener, but are not sure what to do next. There are several other openers of this type that have generally mixed reviews. Cooks like one that is $38, that is a lot for one to fail after a year. I suspect that we will continue to use the replacement Oxo until it completely fails, then return it under their life time warranty. We will always keep out trusty can opener."
5,Works well even for left hands,"I like this and was a little concerned it wouldn't work for my lefthanded wife but it does quite well considering that the handle is set up right handed. The clamp to grip the lid to remove it is unhandy and not quite as easy to use as the rest of it, but it is not totally necessary most of the time anyway."
2,"NOW, I am VERY disappointed in this can opener","We have owned this can opener for 3 years, and it USED to work like a charm. We specifically purchased it because we did not want any metal contaminates from the can in our food, particularly because we have a toddler. The issue is that for the past 4 months it has just gone bad. It's extremely hard to open can goods. It takes about 15 turns for it to semi open the can, and then it has to be pried open."
4,From Across the Pond,"I first saw one of these, what I thought of as a ""sideways"" can opener, over 30 years ago in England, where they are ubiquitous. I have kicked myself ever since for not having bought one and brought it home with me. Now at last we can get that same style here. Love it -- it's about time."
4,"Works great, but essentially disposable","Excellent opener, works as advertised with no sharp edges and the typical ergonomic, quality design of most OXO products.My only complaint is that the blade wears out and cannot be replaced. You have to throw away the entire unit and buy a new one! Pretty wasteful, as the blade wears out much sooner than the rest of the unit. With our previous one, the blade wore out in about a year -- but the rest of the unit still looked like new. If the blade was replaceable, I'd give this 5 stars."
5,Excellent,"Incredible opener. I previously had an early model (from a TV only purchase). It worked, but this is heads above that one. It is easy to attach, runs smoothly and it's easy to tell when the edge is cut. The lid remover is fantastic, no more fighting with lined can lids."
4,OXO Good Grips works great for a manual can opener,"The OXO Good Grips 1049953 Smooth Edge Can Opener works great for a manual can opener. We were trying to replace the Krups 404, which seems to have been discontinued. The OXO worked quite well even though we are elderly, but miss the electric. The OXO separates the lid rim from the can without cutting the metal."
4,Quite lovely,This little gizmo definitely does the job! and it cuts stuff like a knife slicing through butter!
2,"Good, til it died","We like this type of can opener in our home since it does not produce sharp edged lids... This one proved its worth for about 6 months, then it died... stopped working well. It is in our trash can and I am relying on reviews like this one to point me to my next ""disposable"" can opener. Can't anyone make something good that lasts any longer?!"
1,Didn't last but a few months,Worked great at first but then the gear that grips the inside of the can striped and it was pretty much useless! which sucks cause I really liked it while it lasted!
4,Smooth as silk,"I like the OXO brand and thought I would give the ""smooth edge can opener"" a try. The first time I used it, it was so smooth and easy I had no idea I had opened the can! It continues to perform in the same way - purchased it in early March 2011. It works a little differently than a standard hand held opener, but it is very easy and easy to adjust to. Only time will tell how long it will last, but with the OXO brand name I am hoping for a while! So far it is everything that it promised to be, and yes, the edges are completely smooth."
5,No more sharp edges,"My cat loves to lick the tuna can clean, now with the OXO I know she won't cut herself. The only down side is its size. My old one used to fit in my silverware drawer. I've had to find a new spot for the OXO."
2,Could be better,Most of the time this side cutting can opener works well but there are certain cans where it doesn't cut all the way through.
1,POS,"I bought this from amazon. It worked great for about three months and I was happy with it. (Mind you our family eats canned veggies every evening)Then....after three months the can opener started to miss the can and would slip off (not work), the steel started to shred into the food in the can, the last step it was not functioning. I went back to the old can opener where the lid drops in. Works better for the tuna can. Don't buy this POS!!! Save your money and stick with what you have now or get the Oxo regular can opener."
4,once you get the hang of it.......,It works great; it just takes a little bit of practice to get the hang of it. Very different from regular can openers but great for having children around.
5,Awesome!!!,"This is absolutely the best can opener I have ever owned. Who would have thought anyone could improve the standard can opener. This oxo can opener is 100 times better than the old-fashion type. I had gone through 3 of the standard can openers that can be easily bought at Wal-mart. Every single one was a piece of junk that left me bending an prying to get a can open. This one has worked flawlessly every time. Plus there are no sharp edges to worry about, and if you don't use the whole can you can simply place the lid back on and save the remainder for later. In my opinion, it is well worth the extra amount of money."
5,every home should have one,no more worries about sharp edges when opening ANY can of ANYTHINGno more spills from having to flip the jagged edged lid out of the cansince I recycle...no worries about injuring someone sorting commingled binsDO NOT USE ON #10 CANS...that is how my last one lost its grip
1,Didn't last,I rarely use a can opener. This thing broke after very few uses... no longer works. Even tho I have had it a while only used such a few times that for a family who uses it daily... won't last.
1,hard to turn,"I realize I'm in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use. The crank does have a ""good grip"", but I'm not trying to grip it, I'm trying to turn it. I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down. The knob's shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring. It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i'm opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)."
1,disappointing,"Love the smooth edge concept, but actually removing lids from the cans is work. Doesn't work on all cans, as others have mentioned. Overall, it's triple the effort to open up a can. No one in the house cut themselves before we had this, so I'm going back to conventional or scoping out a better made execution. Usually I'm very fond of Good Grips products. Not this one."
4,Works Great!!!,This is a can opener that does exactly what it says it will do...create smooth edges. The only thing I don't like is if I have to drain the juice out of the can the lid is too big to go inside the can to hold back the product inside while the juice drains out. So it's a little more difficult to use that way. Guess I'll have to dirty another utensil and get the strainer out.
3,Great Until It Wears Out,"This is great while it works well, but it gradually wears out and becomes harder and harder to use. If you don't mind buying a new one every couple of years, it's very nice and great for not leaving sharp edged lids around in houses where little hands like to grab things. But because of its relatively short useful life, it loses two stars in my book."
2,Doesn't Last,The folks who gave the 5-star reviews have not had their can openers very long. It does a great job at first but eventually fails after 12-18 months. Read the other reviews-- it's a sure thing it will fail. Steer clear of this Oxo gadget.
2,Doesn't Open Cans!,"I bought this to do one thing - open cans. It mostly doesn't do that one thing, even after going all the way around several time."
1,Doesn't work,"My wife and I bought this can opener because we like the idea of not having a sharp edge on the opened can. The problem with this one is that it will not open most cans. It has a sort of ""pliers"" built in, so you can twist and rip the lid off after you have tried opening it with the cutter. Paid $20 and do not use, after trying it several times."
2,OXO Can Opener,"Nice looking but not as easy to use as one would seem. It appears to open the can, but it won't open. Most times you have to use the opener 2 to three times for it to actually remove the lid. It's not real easy to get the opener on the lid to even use it. You have to look under the opener as you are putting it on the lid to make sure it's on right."
1,This is the worst can opener I've ever owned,It is difficult to get the can opener into the correct position on the can. You cannot tell when the cutting circle has been completed. The lid must be pryed off with a knife or now-non-existent fingernails. The $2.00 can openers are better than this one.
2,Hard to believe it's from Oxo,"After years of an Oxo hand can opener, and a kitchen full of their stuff we decided it was time for a new one. This one should not have been it. Hard to turn. Everyone who picks it up needs instruction in how it works (and they invariably ask why we bought it). We wanted the safe edge aspect for the grandkids... but we'll look elsewhere. Watch for this baby on Woot."
5,Strange but Awesome Can Opener,"This thing is weird to figure out how to use, and the can lid comes off strange, when you're used to a typical can opener...but it is easy to use once you figure it out, turns easily, and leaves a great non-sharp edge. I recommend it!"
3,great easy can opener doesn't last,"I have really enjoyed this can opener - while it lasted - about 1 1/2 years. My original review: ""I use this can opener daily for cans of dog food. It is very smooth and easy to use - no strain on hands. You cannot cut yourself with the edge of the can because it opens the top with a perfectly smooth finish. I highly recommend it."""
4,Persistence pays,"This can opener was a gift, but at first a frustrating one - I was unable to open any can with it!!! I was ready to pitch it, but instead sat down and read some of these reviews. A few reviewers said it worked so effortlessly they thought it wasn't working at all. SO I tried again. Lo and behold the lid came right off with those great little pliers! I'm really glad I waited until after the holiday rush and tried again. It was also helpful to learn that the can itself is not sharp - I had assumed it would be. SO FAR I like it. I'll amend this review (or write another) if it gives out in less than a year."
3,Not as easy as it looks,It took me several tries to actually be able to open a can ... then could not get the lid off and had to use the old-fashioned can opener to accomplish that. Maybe it's me.
1,Bad product from a usually reliable company,"I purchased this can opener to replace my older smooth edge can opener made by a different company, one that had always worked really well but simply gotten old and needed replacing. I expected to really like this Good Grips opner, as I have of their other kitchen tools, so I was really surprised at the at the poor design and problems with this opener. First, one complete revolution of the can NEVER is enough to completely open it. You have to do it two or even three times. Even then, it is very difficult to remove the lid with either the ""beak"" on the opener itself or with your fingers, leading to spillage. I've had it a month, and I'm about to go out and buy a similar smooth edge opener from a different manufacturer. Very disappointing."
1,Beware - needs to install proprietary drivers!,"Amazon doesn't provide compatibility information on this product,so here it is:- it works only with Windows (98 and up)- if you don't install Addonics proprietary drivers, only CF slot will work (even Addonics tech support wasn't sure about that!)- basically, you have to install their drivers if you want to be able to use it- NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LINUX or MACAddonics had a good idea with interoperable memory card readers but failed to make it compatible with standard USB mass storage driver. The need for additional drivers makes it unusable anywhere else but in Windows and it's a common knowledge stability of Windows greatly reduces with additional installed drivers and sw.Due to lack of compatibility and flexibility I don't recommend this product. Amazon has done a poor job in documenting this product, I had to return it! BEWARE, you can't return it once you opened the package!"
5,Just what the little guy needed.,"This was a great find for me. My son had a gecko but wasn't sure what kind or any details, as it turned out this was a great starter kit for food and supplies for in tank. Poor little gecko was hungry!"
3,Middle East Islam 1900s,"(from a seller's review)""The Moslem World of Today"" edited by John R. Mott, Chairman, International Missionary Council. Published in New York by George H. Doran Co., but printed in the UK; 1st ed 1925; 420 pgs. Each section is by a different author, including: The Mystical Life in Modern Islam; Movements in the Life of Women in the Islamic World--India, and an accompanying piece on women in the Near and Middle East (Palestine); New Trends in Moslem Apologetic; The Issue between Islam and Christianity; Influences toward a new art in Egypt and Palestine; Western Education in the Moslem World; Ferments in the Youth of Islam; The Impact and Influence of Western Civilization on the Islamic World; The Renaissance in the Moslem Near East; The Caliphate Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow; The Institution of the Caliphate and the Spirit of the Age; Islam and the Race Question."
1,Beware! This Isn't The Superman Pictured!,"Be aware, before you place your order, you should know that the Superman figure pictured above is not the one you will get. The figure above is the first Mattel DC Superheroes Superman. You will get the second Mattel DC Superheroes Superman (which is a rerelease from a few years ago.) The figure you'll get has a lot less articulation and the sculpt is nowhere near as nice.I ordered four of the figures to give them away as gifts. I was quite dissapointed when they arrived!"
1,False Advertising,"The super man in the Picture is not the one you recieve, Its a different one with way LESS articulation, very, very upsetting. i will Alert amozon and the sender."
5,As necessary at the pattern itself.,"I find myself using this book at least once for every garment I knit. I keep it with my current knitting project. This book gives you several different methods of the different techniques you encounter while knitting a garment - casting on, increasing, decreasing, seaming, etc.. It also gives you the pros and cons of eash different method (i.e. long-tail versus cable cast-on). The illustrations and explanations are extremely helpful. If you have room in your knitting bag, I highly suggest this book."
2,too little information,"This book has many detailed pictures and instructions on cast-on, cast-off, increase and decrease techiques.. which is great.HOWEVER, not enough information on the FINISHING techique. If you really wanna learn the finishing skill, your money will be better spent if you buy another book.The author's pros and cons comment on the different knitting techniques are great, but can be repetitive(eg. Three needle bind-off. Cons: require three needles... DUH!)"
4,The Knitters Book of Finishing Techniques,It has information on how to finish your projects in a very nice way.
2,Worse than before.,"I bought this book because I agree that most what makes or breaks most hand-knit items is the finishing. So I tried a new ""tubular"" cast-on technique offered by Wiseman as the ""most professional, beautiful, elegant"" cast-on possible. The only drawbacks she identifies for it are that it takes more yarn and more time. Well, I'm all about taking more yarn and more time to get it right. So I closely, carefully followed the instructions, did everything right (which I knew because the ""discard"" piece of contrast-color yarn I started with pulled cleanly out of the tube) and I ended up with a RUFFLED edge that flares out away from the hips. And not in a good way. Gah. Why didn't I just stick with the old dependable long-tail cast-on I've used for 20 years?"
3,Book binding- spiral bound,"This is not a comment on the content of the book (which is very good) but rather on the binding. The spiral bound copy is poorly made- it squeaks and creaks (equivalent to nails on a chalkboard). I know it sounds crazy, but it is so bad I am going to exchange this book for another... that I will actually enjoy using."
3,"Acceptable, portable book for finishing","I'm currently working on my Master's Level 1 hand knitting program and purchased this book for reference material. The book is ok. There doesn't seem to be much there that isn't in other reference books I have. I do enjoy that it is spiral bound and hardback. This makes it a great book for travel. Since many of my other reference books are not formatted for travel use, I see this book being in my bag most of the time."
4,"From ""knitting"" to ""finished garment.""","If you have a closet full of bags with knitted pieces and you are stumped as to the steps to get to a SWEATER, this book can help.I have a simple pamphlet about knitting finishing which has been my standby for years. But this book is much nicer, as it has a lot of color illustrations that really show how the finish should look. The photography and choice of yarn colors lets you see clearly how to pick up stitches for a band, how the sewing should look, how to insert a zipper. The spiral binding is hand for laying down flat as you work a finish as a swatch or for real on your sweater. The book is small enough to fit in a normal tote bag, but not so small as to be hard to read.If someone is a knitter in your family, this would make a good gift--even though I've been knitting for years, this is a very handy thing to pop into the knitting bag and carry along. I really like it."
4,Knitter's book of finishing techniques(Nancy.M.Wiseman),"I have been knitting for 70 years and I belong to the knitting guild and I do own many knitting books and enjoy most, the ones about techniques.( I am not a machine knitter)I just got this book but I can see that I will get many excellent ways to improve my habitual knitting.I like the easy to turn spiral pages, the colorful and easy to understand pictures and I appreciate the hard cover.I also have ""Knitting tips & trade secrets"" and I thought that the information in the 2 books might be repetitious,they are not I would say that both are very helpful and enjoyable and would be good for whatever level of knitting expertise of the knitter."
5,Short and sweet,"I agree with all of the reviews in that the basics are largely covered and the photographs are excellent. The only thing that I wish to point out is that if you have a basic knitting reference on your shelf, you will find that this book does not cover anything new. What it provides is a quick reference to the basics that knitters use frequently in a package that you might be willing to lug around in your knitting bag. It isn't small by any means but it is a heck of a lot smaller and lighter than Vogue.If you have been knitting for a while and don't need a reference for basic techniques, I'd pass on this book. Be sure to take advantage of the ""Search Inside"" feature to look at the Table of Contents. That should be enough to tell you if you'll find this book a useful addition to your library."
2,Knitter's Book of Finishing Techniques,I'm a bit disappointed in this book and I agree with a previous reviewer. I already know how to knit - I bought this book to learn about FINISHING. I don't really find much in it that will help me with finishing.
1,"Wrong Cover, Blah Book","WARNING The cover art is wrong. This is not the book that you will receive if you order this. This is the same as the other Nancie Wiseman Knitter's Book of Finishing Techniques with multiple sweaters on the cover. WARNINGNote that this is very basic book with little challenge or inovation on finishing techniques, the promise of how to do rolled riges on the cover is not included. If you've been knitting for a while you probably know what's included in the pages."
5,Great book!,This is the best knitting book I've come across so far. It goes everywhere my knitting does.
3,Just not what I thought,I ordered this book thinking it was going to be more then it was. overall though this is a good book it just wasnt what i was looking for.
4,Great Resource,"I've had this book for several years and just bought a copy for my son and my other son's girlfriend, both new knitters. The pictures and instructions are very clear. It also covers many situations found when finishing products. It's a good addition to any knitter's library."
2,Stick with Vogue Knitting,"I like the fact that this book explains the pros and cons of individual techniques in a systematic fashion and explains when each technique is useful. But I found that in most cases, this book contains the exact same information as Vogue Knitting, but with diagrams that are harder to follow. In some cases, Vogue Knitting actually contains more information.For example, this book describes a Kitchener Stitch bind off that you can use for 1x1 ribbing that is very elastic and good for areas like the neck where you need a lot of elasticity. Among the ""cons"" the book mentions is the fact that you can only use this bind off for 1x1 ribbing. While that statement is, strictly speaking, true (you can't use this exact bind off for 2x2 ribbing), Vogue Knitting features a modified version for 2x2 ribbing that this book does not have!Bottom line: Go withVogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Bookfor better diagrams and more info!"
4,Great book but misnamed!,"This is a great book for knitters who are trying to improve their skills. I bought it because my finishing skills need to be improved. However, the finishing techniques are not as detailed as I would have liked.But this book is much more than a finishing book. It is an excellent instruction book for at least intermediate knitters or perhaps someone who just wants to have their projects look a bit more professional.I have used it again and again. Different ways to increase and decrease are well explained.I can't give it five stars because the book doesn't really do what it says it does. But I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their knitting."
5,Great.,"Great for details on finishing. Limited topic, but there is no sense in making a nice project and not know how to finish it nicely. This book covers that nicely with good photos."
1,What a disappointment!...,"I am an experienced knitter but always need help with the little, but very importent, finnishing details. However, when I bought this book it was a big disappointment. The amount of information was minimal and you were always referred back to previous pages so that working with the book was not as simple as the spiral bound format would lead you to believe. There are better books around to treat this subject"
5,Initially I was skeptical BUT...,"Initially I was skeptical of this work, afterall, Vogue's referenceworks are the de facto standard in the knitting community, but Iwas pleasantly pleased when I received it. This compilation oftechniques is simply spectacular with it attention to details. Eachtechnique (several variations of cast on and bind off, increases anddecreases, button holes, seams and even picking up stitches) isclearly explained including a list of benefits of this technique anddrawbacks. Multicolored illustrations demonstrate the methodsshown to make the products which are clearly photographed fromeach section. All in a spiral bound format that fits easily in yourknitting bag!"
2,Not up to par,"PROS: priceCONS: short lifespan, incorrect fitIt seems most Saturn upper engine mounts collapse within a few years, including the OEM Saturn mount. With that said, this part collapsed in about 12-15 months of average ""soccer mom"" driving. While the price is great, I would pay 50% more for a part that would last over 2 years.I agree with the other reviewer that the part did not fit correctly. The chassis hole mounts were spaced too far apart. I had to dremel about 1/16"" to fit without stripping bolt threads."
1,These are junk pure and simple,Bottom line this product is a cheaply made Chinese knock off. Anchor makes their video and waxes about the product like it's the best thing since sliced bread. Don't believe it. It is NOT a good buy. This part will collapse in short order and cause noise and vibration like you never heard before. An old OEM part with over 200000 miles on it is still better than this new one. Shame on Anchor!
4,Good part good price good shipping,Part worked well.... some rubber flash but just trimmed it to fit. I asked my mechanical and he uses same Anchor brand in his shop. Looks OEM quality. Fast and Free shipping and can't beat Amazon DELIVERED Price.
2,Just a little off,"The mount seems to be made well and price was excellent. Shipment also good. But it did not slide into place as the original. It's a little ""tight"". The dealer said it needed to be replaced for almost $200. Videos and forums described how easy (and much cheaper) to replace.After installation, the engine has a vibration that was not there with the old part. ASAP I plan on replacing the old part to see if the vibration is in fact from the new mount."
3,KMFDM dance: House & Gabber,"This EP blew me away at first. It's electronic dance - very little rock. The Anarchy remix by Skold stands out. KMFDM do Gabber/HardTrance? Unbelieveably hard & fast! A radical remix - you'll hardly recognise it! The rest is good too, especially the DJ Talla 2XLC remixes of Megalomaniac. Housy... I'd give it 4 stars, but this single wore off quickly."
2,"If you like Angst, Nihil, and Xtort, you will hate MDFMK","MDFDMK shows the softer side of KMFDM, and frankly I don't like it. The usual sounds of KMFDM's jamming guitars are nowhere to be found on this album. In Anarchy and it's mixes, MDFMK just plain doesn't sound like good old KMFDM."
3,Great recipes but Robuchon is not God,"The photographs and the recipes are undoubtedly amazing. I just wish the author of the book would have just let the food/recipes speak for itself, implementing Robuchon's philosophy that ""less is more."" I found the constant brown-nosing of Robuchon by Patricia Wells in the first part of the book tiresome, repetitive and irritating. She was clearly ""ga-ga"" over Robuchon and it certainly took away from integrity of his story."
5,absolutely superb!,"OMG, where do I start? Utterback's virtuosity is hair raising, and yet the melody always reigns supreme. Yes, there is a thicket of notes at times but I was continually amazed at utterback's unfailing music taste and remarkable piano tone. The piano used in the recording is glorious, among the best I've heard. Utterback's own compositions range from bittersweet to fun, how sad the first two are not notated!!"
5,Shine On Boxset,A must have box set if you are a fan or collector of Pink Floyd. One of the original Pink Floyd box sets and a must have.
5,A Must Have for the Pink Floyd fan.,"This is truly one of the best box sets I've ever seen. The attention to detail in the packaging is second only to the digitally remastered sound quality on all of the CD's. Personally I would have dropped a couple of the CD's in the set and replaced them with others but it is worth the price as it is. As for the ""critics"" words above, I don't know who this person is but they are definately NOT a Pink Floyd fan, what a ludicrous review!"
1,What?!? One Star?!?!?,"Luke, you ask, how could you give this boxed set one star even though you love everything in it?!? It's what's not in it that I don't like. I got this boxed set (which costs just as much or more as buying the individual cds), then I got all of the albums that didn't make the cut, like The Final Cut, Obscured by Clouds, Atom Heart Mother, More, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn. While the book is interesting, it doesn't say anything that can't be learned on the internet. All in all, this set ISN'T all in all. It leaves out 2 of their best 4 albums, and only because Dave Gilmour didn't like them. Guess what, Dave: The Division Bell is a real letdown! This is just a more complex and expensive way of getting Floyd albums."
5,the best,Just about the whole set was good they should of had more of the newer stuff in it but over all it was really really good
1,shine on box set,"Not everything was in the set that was said, if anyone is to buy anything always buy new, NOT USED. I have bought other box sets from Amazon and had no problems but they where new."
5,New transmitters for old garage door openers,"New transmitters for old garage door openers:Skylink 318K (and 318R) transmitters (and receivers) provide an easy fix for a worn out transmitter, allowing for a new transmitter to operate an old garage door opener."
2,Works fine but needs better batteries,The product works as advertised but the load on the batteries is pretty high during the brief moment when there is a transmission. The batteries included where not up to the task (their voltage dropped by almost 1.5V) especially in cold weather. Everything is now fine but the weather is not as cold as it was and that's why I would hesitate to recommend this transmitter. Same remarks for the Skylink keychain transmitters.
4,"good, informative read","This book was quite interesting. Told from the perspective of an Englishman who was living in Korea at the time the Japanese invaded and began their ""colonization"" of Korea. It can get a little bogged down in names as people come in and out of what's happening and there are many different names thrown at you, but the information was very enlightening. The author's final caution and call for action in the Asian theater is frighteningly prophetic when we look at the time this book was published and the series of events that would lead to WWII in the Pacific. So you know though, this book is available for free online as a PDF through the Gutenberg Project."
3,Slow Read,"This book is very well written, from the standards of the early 1900's. (which is when it was written) Sometimes it's difficult to read because the story is FAR too detailed with names of people and city/town names. If you're looking for an overview of Korean history this isn't the book for you."
5,Get what you want -- and avoid conflict,"This book is full of practical tips on how to ask for what you want without conflict. Learn how to coach employees, talk to your kids and get more out of your relationship with the five laws of conscious conversation. A good read!"
3,Gracious but predictable offering,"Worthwhile entry into the slow-core genre may find fans of Low, Idaho, Codeine and even Slowdive in love with the repetitious electric guitar minimalism. The production may not always compliment the sometimes similar sounding compositions, but more often then not (particularly in the greater 1st side) most of the seductively haunting qualities that give the sub-genre it's lingering effectiveness remain in abundance. Timonium may still have a ways to go before breaking out of a musical mold that sees to much borrowed from, but their full length should please fans of slow, introspective alternative rock, even if it does not overwhelm."
1,Cracked crystal mug,"After only 45 days, one of the mugs was cracked top to bottom when I removed it from my freezer. Disappointing and not worth the hassle to return. Tom Nelson"
4,"Not a coffee table book, but practical guide","this book is a good accompanyment to other Japanese gardening books. Definitely not to decorate a coffee table, but to practically show one options (various bridges, paths, fencing, ponds, etc) that one can incorporate into their garden for a japanese feel. I especially liked the detailed garden sketch at the end of the book showing an example of what to plant where. I would have assumed much fewer plants from the pictures than what the author sketched in. This will come in extremely helpfully come planting time!"
4,Great dictionary,It is a different from of sign language that I enjoy learning about very much especially since Signing Exact English is true to it's title.
5,Easy to use,"This is a great book, easy to understand, easy to do the signs, love that is spiral bound, pages easy to pratice with."
3,"Good guide, but...","Wish it was a little better indexed so you can find a particular sign without already knowing it. That said, I do use this in my profession and it has come in handy when needed. Small size is a plus, too (even though it's quite thick and not exactly ""pocket-sized"")."
4,This book is useful and nicely illustrated.,I have found this book to be useful in the classroom. I have read in Modsigns Press that they have a spanish version of this book. I was wondering if you could send me a catalog so that I could order this version of your book. I think it would be helpful for the spanish students in my classroom.
1,Haven't Received It,"I ordered this the beginning of Nov. and still have not received it. I have emailed seller, but no response yet."
5,It's a Book.,"How can you give it less than 5 stars? It's a book that says it will teach you S.E.E. if you read it. That's what it does.The signs are clearly illustrated with comments clarifying how each sign should be presented. With a little effort you can certainly master a broad range of signs easily.Is it magic? Nope, but it is a dang fine book for learning or teaching SEE sign."
5,Opened doors to more learning!,"About 10 years ago I took a six week course through the town where I teach (in a private preschool). This book was required and used by the teacher (who works at a local school for deaf children). I would never ever be even close to her ability and speed...but found that this resource has been used successfully each year in our classroom. The children love signing, and we've found that it has increased their knowledge and awareness. Children ages three to six just love the ""hands on"" experience and are quick to share it with their families. What started as a new addition to our room's curriculum has now spread into all three classrooms in our school. The parents are thrilled, the children are happily learning, and the teachers look forward to learning with them. Thanks go to this great book (and the entire effort to put it together)! The introduction is also very useful. I would highly recommend this reference book for anyone at all interested in signing!"
4,Great for new Modes,"If you don't have any Depeche album, this is a great buy. All of the songs are top quality stuff. If you (like me) are a long time Depeche fan, skip this and buy the new single instead. It has two new songs; ""Surrender"" is one of the best songs they've released in a long time."
4,Still miss Alan,GREAT SONGS LOVE IT BUT THE DIFFERENCE WITHOUT ALAN IS NOTICEABLE BUT HEY TOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Depeche Mode est si bon!,This compilation of DM tracks is incredible. The group's music has delighted the masses for two decades and this set gives twenty-one (+4 bonus) concrete reasons why. This album is a must for any music fan.
4,A Strong Document of One The Greatest Bands Ever,"First off, I rate this album as only four stars instead of five for the simple reason it too effecient. Good Depeche Mode records are a little sloppy here and there. Even though this only a singles compilation, it still seems a bit of a let down that so many good tracks are not on it. But regardless, it is a killer album. From the grinding riffs of ""Barrel of a Gun"" and ""I Feel You"" to the soaring near-gospel of ""Condemnation"" Depeche Mode hold your attention fast and pull you on a journey through electronic nirvana. My favorite track here is ""Stripped"" which has a towering chorus, and I even get a real kick out of the sputtering engine in the intro. Casual fans of Depeche Mode or Techno Music should get this album, and even though there is only one new song, serious fans should consider this too. It's a good way to reminisce a little about the good old days, at least."
4,A recent fan's review of Depeche's latest singles,"Well...I have been a fan of Depeche Mode for about three years now. I purchased this album before I bought the albums containing the original songs. I must say that sometimes I like the newer versions of the same great stuff, but I like the orginal songs better at different times. ""Strangelove"" sounds better on the Music for the Masses CD rather than the Singles CD always! I wish that the more recent versions didn't cut out some of the neat intros to the orginal songs. Other than that, this is a great double CD for any new or original Depeche Mode fan!"
4,Missing a song,"Where is ""I Want You Now""? Can't be a complete 5 star item unless it has this single. Maybe I'm just an idiot and didn't realize that this was not one of their singles. Nonetheless, it is an important part of their image that is totally absent from this compilation. CATCHING UP WITH DEPECHE MODE, SONGS OF FAITH & DEVOTION, and VIOLATOR remain significant points in their career. Latter day material is just the group trying to reinvent themselves. I would rather listen to mope music of early Smiths or The Cure. You figure it out..."
3,hmm...I or 2 good songs and a ton of slow ballads.,In my opinion the best song in this cd is Everything counts. After that everything is wayyyyy to slow. Thats it.
4,ANOTHER GREATEST HITS CD?,"With only one new track, this compliation is a bit stale. Though none of the older songs are bad, it's just that I've already heard them all (even the ""remixed"" variants included here and there). The sole new track ""Only When I Lose Myself"" is probably DM's most romantic song other than ""Enjoy The Silence."" Sure, it's just another compilation, which is why it got only 4 stars from me, but ""Only When I Lose Myself"" is definitely worth buying the CD for!"
5,"Depeche Mode's Best, all in one package!","The Singles 86>98Of course in a DM greatest hits album you would have Personal Jesus, It's No Good, I Feel You and Never Let Me Down Again, but to hear Walking in My Shoes,In Your Room, and Enjoy the Silence makes my day.This is the kind of album that you can play while driving, while walking down the street. while working out, or while cleaning your apartment. Now I mean that in a good way. It puts you in an energetic mood, and sing-songing away while you work is a great way to get things done. In that way, you can think of this as a motivational album, LOL.I don't think this is for sitting around the house though. There are better albums for contemplation...:)The ""81-84 singles compilation"" is also great, and in a similar vein. If you are a fan, this is a great addition to your collection, and hearing hit after hit, back to back really reminds you of how good DM is."
4,One of the best electronic bands,"Depeche Mode does their brand of electronic music very well, with songs that are catchy and stick in the head and are a few times even emotionally evocative. This is a 2-disc compilation, with the first disc being the stronger one, probably cuz it's the one with the radio hits. But the second disc definitely has some gems too. Good stuff on disc 1:Never Let Me Down AgainPersonal JesusEnjoy the SilencePolicy of TruthWorld in My EyesDisc 2 meritorious melodies:Barrel of GunIt's No GoodEverything CountsIf you like sythesizer, you'll like this."
5,"5 Stars, most definitely","Great CD. Practically every song on this is good and enjoyable to listen to. If you like Depeche Mode, you will most definitely like this. Depeche Mode is a great group. They have great vocals and the music is like no other. There is a reason why Depeche Mode has been around for over 20 years. Their music is top-notch."
4,DEPECHE MODE,"DEPECHE MODE'S LYRICS SPEAK THE TRUTH their very heartfelt and true, add the awesome guitars the great voice and everthing else they have and you have a great band this is there only cd i have so i dont know much except its good"
5,Beautiful!,"Absolutely wonderful! A friend of mine introduced me to depeche mode, and I must say, I'm hooked! Since I didn't own any of their previous CD's, this was a terrific way to start my collection. The variety of music is great, the lyrics are beautiful, and the tunes themselves are stunning."
5,best road trip album,This has so many good songs. I cant go on a trip without bringing it. My kids know all the songs.
2,Overrated.,"Okay, so this band put out some songs that got a lot of radio airplay. Big deal - their music is largely boring and depressing. Except for 3 or 4 noteworthy songs, the rest can give you a headache and make you want to put your head through a wall. They seem obsessed with dark themes. For a more uplifting experience, check out Orchestral Manouevres In The Dark (OMD)."
2,depeche mode [was bad] from the years 86-98,i bought this because i really liked depeche modes early stuff but i only liked one song on this albuum thank god i really loved that one song in my arms is a great song
4,This will 'Never Let Me Down',"This is a great double CD that has some of Depeche Mode's best songs on it. While I'm not a BIG Depeche Mode fan, I know great music when I hear it. This let me in on some their songs I've never heard like 'Stripped' and 'Question of Time'. DM were one of the first synthesizing new wave bands that I can think of and a lot of bands (even some of the ones that are out today) that came out after them were obviously inspired by this group and you can hear some Depeche Mode in their music. My favorite songs on this album are 'Never let me down', 'Home' and 'World in my eyes'. Even if you never thought of yourself of a Depeche Mode fan, I would at least reccomend people to buy this album or at least find it in a library. END."
5,Great way to re-live your old DM memories,"Even though there really is only one new song on this two CD set, it is just a fantastic way to both get into the music of DM (if you have never heard them before) or revive your memories of the songs. I got chills when Personal Jesus started and it reminded me of the first time that I ever heard that song. If you already have every DM CD, this is still a great way to organize all of those great singles into one package - highly recommended!"
4,First Timer,"This is the first DM cd that I have purchased. I recognized several of the songs from hearing them on the radio over the years - others were new to me. Some reviews here state that the first cd is the better of the two - however, I prefer the #2 cd - especially the songs ""Walking In My Shoes"" and ""In Your Room"". Overall, a very good cd - one I would recommend to the casual DM listener."
3,Problem is if you already have all (most) of the albums....,"Don't get me wrong, I am a die-hard true fan of DM ever since I first heard and saw them in concert over 12 years ago. My problem is that I cannot see shelling out 25 some-odd bucks for songs that are already on the multitude of CDs I already own by them. It's just redundant. I also can't justify buying it for the couple of new songs, so I am probably going to get the singles of those. BUT if you are new to DM and want a good quickie intro that spans thier many years of music, buy this CD. I do agree with the other reviews on the songs that should have been but were not included, however. It's not as complete as it should be - but then again, what compliation ever is?"
1,Compilations are a big let-down,"Hey, don't get me wrong here. I love DM. It's just that I think bands should add that different thing to motivate old-time fans in purchasing it. For a 2-CD set, this compilation brings too little for anyone who has their CDs already..."
2,"Ok, but there's better compilations.","I bought this about 5 years ago. Between the 2 discs there's about 8 songs I like, and I skip all the rest. I hated the remix of In Your Room on this disc; the original was MUCH better. I found a few gems I hadn't heard before that I really like, but all in all it really wasn't worth what it costs."
1,Ugly stik.,"This is just terrible. It is not in the least bit the rod in the picture. I recieved a red gold and black one. The ""quality fuji"" reel seat is CRAP. It is so loose it could even fit a penn 8000 reel on. Thats the biggest spinner. Its so so thick! twice as thick as any other 10 foot pole, so bulky, dont buy, Ugly stiks are so overrated. And when i bent the rod i could here cracking. Penn and shakespear are usually great, but this is just a dissapointment. I returned it for a refund, lets hope this goes smoothly, Amazon usually has great refunds."
4,great rod but too long,"13-year-old nephew adored rod even tho his commercial fisherman dad thought it was too long for him. Long-story-short, kid used rod for 3 weeks before deciding dad was right. Wise mom told him too late for that kid, lesson learned. Still a really nice rod and we'll keep it."
3,Nothing particulary new...,"I read Ancient Future Faith and was really blown away at Webbers insightfulness. Most authors have one book in them and then they continue to write other books that are spin offs of the main idea. This book is attempting to deal with evengelism in the postmodern world, but unfortunately it left me wanting. I didnt feel like I left the book with any practical way of implementing his ideas. In fact, I would have been just as well off with just reading Ancient Future Faith and leaving it at that. Chapter 3 was a good chapter on Evangelism and he has a great bibliography in the back of the book, but I would just read that chapter and not buy the book."
4,Close but we need a new book,This is a fast read. It flows nicely with good illustration. The combat between Doria and our Khayr ad-din was very tense almost in a dramatic sense instead of a history book or even a biography. Well done by the author.On another note. It seems to vary from the memoirs of Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha (at this point not yet available in English). It is time a new book on the greatest sea captain of the age was written.
1,Do not waste your money,This a very badly made corset the front metal strips tear out cutting your skin not deep but it makes for pretty uncomfortable experance the satain tears out in the sides in genral its a total disapointment I really im dissatisfied
3,90'S SOFT-CORE QUAD,"If you like the 90's quad sound, but a little more softcore, this is a good album for you. I like it, nothing spectacular, but there are some catchy tunes for body movin'. Adding this to your collection of ""alternative"" sounds in 2005 would be wise. I can't really get into music when it first comes out, because everybody else is listening to it and I get burned out really quick on it. So an album like this allows me to escape back to a time when life and music was more simple."
4,Starting Over,"After spending twenty years with Mercury Records, John Mellencamp left the label for Sony due to Mercury not putting enough support behind his efforts. His first album for Sony finds a man pushing fifty with a wiser outlook on life. The album is his first after he suffered a heart attack and the songs reflect the fragility of life especially in songs like ""Your Life Is Now"", ""I'm Not Running Anymore"", ""Days Of Farewell"" & ""It All Comes True"". ""Eden Is Burning"" is the sequel to ""Jack & Diane"" and we find the couple grown up and facing midlife. The album has a dark, haunting sound and Mr. Mellencamp's voice perfectly captures the theme and feel of the record."
5,Why haven't I been paying more attention to this guy?,"Mellencamp has always been one of those artists I hear on the radio and find myself singing along. I haven't bought a CD of his since Scarecrow and thought I had outgrown his simplistic songwriting, until now. The songs on his latest are surprisingly strong and rich. I simply can't stop playing this CD and am kicking myself for dismissing him in the past. I won't make that mistake twice. Mellencamp has made my list of artists I buy without hearing. Thanks John for showing me how wrong I was about you."
3,The old dog still has it,"Forced to seek refuge at Sony after his old label all but ignored him, John Mellencamp's eponymous release proves that he is one of the most consistent rockers of the past 15 years. Whether it be the semi-comical ""I'm Not Running Anymore,"" the reflective ""Positively Crazy,"" or the uplifting ""Your Life is Now,"" Mellencamp draws on his Heartland/Everyman roots almost as well as Bob Seger or Bruce Springsteen in their heyday. Only the last tracks of the album sound forced. ""Break Me Off Some"" is an ill-advised hip-hop attempt and ""Summer of Love"" sounds like a reject from American Fool. Minor stumbles aside, John Mellencamp, the album, demonstrates that John Mellencamp, the artist, still has a lot of bite left in him."
2,At best mediocre,"John Cougar Mellencamp have been very uneven throughout his long career with the exceptions of the brilliant ""Lonesome jubilee"" and ""Scarecrow"". On this album it seems that Mellencamp is trying to start fresh and the self title is sort of evidence of that. The music have more of a modern approach but I don't think it work at all. It's very hard to find any song that immediately catches your attention, and ""Your life is now"" is the closest Mellencamp get in that department. Even straight after listening to this album, from the beginning to the end, it's hard to remember any of the songs, since they are at best mediocre."
1,Disappointment,"The beginning of Mellencamp's Old Man rock phase - complete let down from his ""Mr. Happy Go Lucky"" album - Although I did like ""Fruit Trader"" and ""I'm Not Running Anymore"" 2 good songs out of 12 does not make it worth buying - I have not listened to this album in years"
4,One of the best...,This CD is definitly one of the best I own. A wonderful variety of old fashioned rock-n-roll and new soul. A must for any one who appreciates good music. Mellencamp really broadens his horizons with this CD.
3,Background instruments obscure vocals/stretches are few,"I am a long-time fan, and have seen JM in concert a few times. Let's face it, many of us haven't listened to some of his CDs more than once.I, like you want to hear Mellencamps voice tear through the guitars and violins. Unfortunately, it seems like he's hiding his voice under a cloud of new instruments in his latest release. In short, he just doesn't seem to push hard anymore.I've been waiting for Mellencamp to come up with a flash of brilliance that would skyrocket to the top of the charts. It appears that the jar may finally be empty."
3,cologne,"great scent, but it fades after a few hours. usually mugler perfumes will stay, so I'm questioning the authenticity of this one. I shouldn't have to reapply it by afternoon!"
5,Never disappointed!,Always get great deals on this product and my hubby gets so many compliments when he wears it. Worth every penny!
4,Gets the job done!,"So far, I'm pretty impressed with these funnels. They've held up great and the non-slip feature is fantastic. The only thing I really don't like about them is the hole is SO small it takes forever for thicker liquids to get through. Overall, I'm happy I have these."
4,Nice product,What can you say about a funnel? I like the fact that the strainer stores by snapping into the bottom of the funnel (no digging in a drawer to find the smaller part). It could be a little more generous in depth but the semi/translucent funnel makes it easy to see the progress.
3,Oxo No Grips Funnels,"I am really disappointed in the lack of sturdy handles on both funnels. There is not much to hold on to when straining hot gravy, etc. And the strainer insert is very flimsy! I bought this set to qualify for free shipping. If I had seen the funnels in the store I would not have purchased them."
4,Excellent kitchen untensil,"This funnel set was more than I expected. Great high-temp plastic can with-stand high heat w/o melting. The strainer 'clips' into the larger funnel so that it doesnt get sloshed around by your liquid and fail to do its job. The strainer also snaps into the tip of the smaller funnel so it doesnt get lost while being stored. The rubber 'accenst' are actually desigend and placed for 'gripping' the vessel you are filling so that you dont have to worry about the funnel falling out. Nice wide 'mouth' on each funnel for fewer spills. I only wish that all 3 pieces would 'snap' togehter for storing the whole system together. Otherwise, this is the perfect funnel set."
5,It's a funnel...,"What can you really say? It's a good quality funnel set and I do like the little rubber ""grips"" but I'm not sure how much good they really do. Regardless, this is a necessary addition to any kitchen!"
2,Not good for any normal uses in the kitchen.,"I bought this set as a kitchen tool, but it did not work as I expected. I would read the product dimensions carefully and consider what you need. There were two main issues:1. The diameter of the outflow is very narrow. So far, I have used it twice and it did not work for:- a pureed carrot soup with no major chunks- refilling my pepper mill with whole peppercorns - they clogged the funnel.2. The diameter of the bowl is not big enough. You can't pour say, a large pyrex bowl, cleanly into it. We have a storage container with a 6"" diameter and that is too big to easily use this as well.I would use this for freely flowing liquids only - no soups, no whole spices."
3,B U L K Y,"This is a good funnel SET, because both funnels are attached, so there is no way to lose any. Also, the strainer come in handy for straining unwanted solids out of liquids. However, these funnels are SO big! Unless you want, or need, to pour a great deal of liquid at once, I'd suggest getting a smaller, stainless-steel funnel set. Or, get this one JUST for the third-piece strainer, (that I've seen no-where else, although I'm positive other strainers must have them). These strainers take up extra room in your kitchen storage, that may not be necessary to use."
3,ok i guess.,it has a funny looking filter (???) that comes with the funnel. it's a strainer. stretching it to call a tiny little thing a stariner.
4,Nice; Filter is Confusing,"These are nice. The two sizes nest and kind of do a clicky thing that makes storage pretty easy, for such odd-shaped things.My only question is around the filter. I'm not sure how it works. I mean, I think it just sits in the funnel, but if that's the case it moves around and is pretty impractical (unusual for OXO). However, I can't figure out any other way, any locking mechanism, etc.This wasn't a big deal and they're great as funnels, I just don't know they'd be great as a strainer."
5,Great second book! Kingsbury does it again,"In her second novel, Suzanne Kingsbury brings beauty and hope to this story of the drug world of Atlanta. And she manages to do it without an ounce of cheese, melodrama, or unreality. She shows us how this world affects not only the primary narrator - the poor, black, and sympathetic Gracey Fill - but also the rich kids of Atlanta's white elite. The landscape of this novel is gritty and frightening, but full of heart and humanity. Kingsbury has obviously done some hard research, and the fruit of her work is this dark and painful, but ultimately hopeful, story. Her characters breathe and love and suffer on every page. They, along with the elegant prose, carried me swiftly and effortlessly to the book's end. Kingsbury's passion and talent once again shine."
3,"Nice, but don't fit to correct size","If you normally wear a 10.5, you should try and get the 10. The shoe runs larger than normal"
2,look great; run very big,"I agree with the other reviewer -- these are mis-sized. I wear an 11.5 or sometimes a 12, and due to his/her review I got an 11.5. The shoes are far too big for me and I'll have to return them."
4,Great stories,"My daughters (ages 5 & 6) love these stories. The CDs are a lifesaver when we are in the vehicle. I agree with a review I read previously, though. I truly wish there was only one complete story per CD. It's a big inconvenience to change the CD mid-story. I burned a 2nd copy of the stories onto separate discs to make it easier."
5,Wonderful!,"The audiobooks are so good. The children love to listen to the stories while we are in the car and, honestly, I love these stories too. The author herself reads the stories and she does a wonderful job. There is a strong educational component to these stories as well. Lots of historical facts made so interesting in these fabulous stories. I have 5, 8 and 11 year olds and all three of them listen with rapt attention. We bought multiple collections up to book 40. Will likely buy more when we finish these. I would recommend this item!"
5,My kids can't get enough!!!!,"Wow. My wife and I were going on a long car trip with a 5, 3 and 1 year old, and wanted an alternative to the DVD player and Disney movies. What a find!!! Our 5 and 3 year old were silent and tranfixed on these stories for over 4 hours. that was 3 months ago. Now, our five year old spends her ""quiet time"" in her room, coloring and listening to these great stories. They are not silly or sassy (like some others), they are educational, smart and riveting tales featuring strong and confident children. For our girls, it is especially gratifying to have them listen to stories featuring a girl (Annie) who doesn't talk endlessly of princesses and dresses. A huge bonus is we actually like listening to them also!!!! These books on CD are simply amazing. On Saturday mornings, our girls get up and listen to the stories in their rooms, while playing quietly!!!! We have found the holy grail of parenting, and it was hidden in a Magic Treehouse!"
1,Not for me,"My 5 yrs old did the hearing, not me, but she was not that intrested as she was in many ohters which where short and her age appropriate.I am not sure how the stories where, becoz i didn't get to hear them, but i returned it, since she didn't get to enjoy them.But their was sure lot of good reviews, so i can't rate the cd based on its storeis, the rating is based on my kid's liking."
1,Name tracks is not ok,"Dear:This isn't possible. I believe after years disappointments with customers (view 1 star) I think thats problem solved..BUT NO. I received new products and the track names are not equal to the contents of the readings. Only two of the 10 CDs are right!. I bought 1-8 audiobooks too. Please, I want to return the CDs, but obviously these are already open.Thanks"
2,Not very sturdy.,Flimsy. At best you might be able to flip a small fried egg. I believe the latter model is the non-stick turner.If the gripper (handle) part is heat-resistant that would be ideal.
2,flimsy,"This is flimsy at best, and because it's so thin, I found it actually sticking really bad to my griddle and it stuck to pancakes. It seems like it would work well, but it just doesn't. Sorry OXO, I generally love your stuff, but this is not going to be used or recommended."
4,Large Flexible Turner,This turner is very good for turning food in a skillet. I used it turn some sticky carmelized onions and it handled the batch very well. It also cleaned up the edge of the plastic turner I was using. I am going to try it on some more items in the near future.
3,Limited in applications,"I was hoping this would replace a standard spatula, but it is too flimsy to handle anything other than eggs and light pancakes. Nice for cookies."
3,Not the same LTJ,"I picked this CD up and listened to it, at first it was really good, but then I got bored. This CD doesn't have the renewing quality of Pezcore, Losers,Kings and Losing Streak. From a standpoint of view, this is a really good album, if the band wasn't LTJ. LTJ's great, but they've put out a lot better stuff than this, also I miss jessica, (no offense to Pete). For anyother band, this would be a great album, but the standards are higher when your LTJ, their still great. But pick up all the albums before this one before you pick up Rockview, oh and be warned, true to it's name, rockview is more about rock than punk/ska. Not that that's bad, but the horns on it aren't as blaring as in the previous albums. Anyway, this is still a good album, my fav songs are Big Crash and Al's War and as far as message, this is the best of the lot, so it's in the middle, hence 3 stars"
2,This is a pretty good cd,"This is ok. I love LTJ. I have loved them for years. I wasn't has impressed with this cd. though. If you think this is the best cd you most likely are not a true fan of them. Just listen to losing streak and losers,kings,etc... THose are both awsome cds."
2,Disapointing,"Come on, did nobody else not like this CD? It had very little ska, and overall, it didn't sound like Less than Jake, more like an over-produced imitation.The horns were probably the worst part. They sounded like a synthesiser set to ""concert brass."" And besides that, there weren't enough of them. What there was, was extremely repetetive and boring.Some songs, like ""Five State Drive"", and ""Scott Farcas takes it on the chin"", sounded vaguely like classic LTJ, but overall, this CD is probably their worst so far."
2,this is not the LTJ i know,this album has good lyrics. the band has matured but their sound has gone down hill. it sounds like it was recorded in some big studio with a bunch of company bigwigs who wanted to make money off a younger generation. a true LTJ fan would not find this album pleasing
3,What's up with the horns?!?,"I bought this cd thinking i would be getting a great cd (all of the customer reviews said it was great), but it turned out to be a huge bust, mainly because the horns in the background sounded fake! They totally messed this cd up by changing the sound of the horns. Besides the horns being fake, the songs aren't even that good. The only reason this cd gets a 3 star rating is that the cd would be good one to see live, because the horns wouldn't fake (probably). This is Less Than Jake's worst cd."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING-Might as well be Goldfinger,"Face it, if you are a real LTJ fan then you have to realize that this album is horrible. You want real LTJ, listen to Pezcore. Save your money"
3,"Pretty Good, but Losing Streak is Better",I thought this was a pretty good album that I bought after I got Losing Streak. This was a little dissapointing but otherwise it is kinda cool. The best song is definitely Nervous in the Alley (song 5).
5,I love this Band!,This is the first LTJ CD I have ever got and I'm glad I did. I could tell from the first song that this CD was awesome. I love almost all the songs. Go buy it! If you like this I reccomend Five Iron Frenzy and Reel Big Fish!Skank On!
3,dissapointing,"less than jake has always been one of my favorite bands, but when i bought hello rockview i was somewhat dissapointed. this album is good, but definitely not their best. if you want to know what real ska-punk is all about, buy one of less than jake's older albums"
5,And the award goes to...,"Hello Rockview should be in the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame. Quite possibly the highlight of Less Than Jake's musical career, it puts out the absolute best music they have ever created. It should win massive amounts of music awards, and frankly, I'm surprised it doesn't. From tracks to album art, this CD is the some of the best Skaa I have ever heard in my life. Slapstick, Reel Big Fish, Mighty Mighty Bosstones... No, The award goes to HELLO ROCKVIEW!!!"
4,Not Too Shabby...,"This happens to be my first Less Than Jake CD and believe me, Im not disappointed. Its catchy, fun to listen to and its got a nice ska/punk sound going on. Im definently gonna pick up the other LTJ CDs. The majority of the songs, like Last One Out of Liberty City, Motto and Scott Farcas Takes it On The Chin are good but some of them are annoying like Great American Sharpshooter and Richard Allen George...No, It's Just Cheez. And afterawhile, it gets kinda dull and you really dont want to listen to it that much anymore. But nonetheless, its a good album and I really enjoyed it even though theres nothing that terribly special on it. Id recommend it to anyone into the ska/punk scene or someone whos just looking for a fun, catchy album to listen to."
5,Great Album! Perfct surfing music!,"On ""Hello Rockveiw"", Less Than Jake are back with a vengance. ""All my best friend are metalheads"" and ""History of a boring town"" are clearly the best songs on the ablum, but it's hard to find a song that's not good engough to release as a single. What it's lacking in quantity, it makes up for in quality. There are no ""Space-fillers"" on this CD, and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I have."
4,An Excellent CD,"Losing Streak is by far a better CD for all of you just getting into LTJ. Rockview is also excellent. Buy it as your 2nd LTJ CD. The more you listen to it, the more you love it. The band has/is developing their sound which is making them slightly more mainstream. This doesn't diminish the quality of Rockview. Excellent LTJ work."
5,its nutricious and delicious,"So far, my favorite LTJ album. It just feels like it has substance, something that a few of their other albums lack. It's kind of in the gray area between ska and pop-punk and regular rock. They went on to lean more towards the pop-punk and rock in their next CD, Borders and Boundaries, but right here, they have the perfect mix of the three. Every single song is good (except for maybe Motto), but the ones I would recommend the most are:--All My Best Friends are Metalheads--Five State Drive--History Of a Boring Town--Great American Sharpshooter--Big Crash--Scott Farcus Takes it on the ChinGives those a try, see if you like them. Less Than Jake really are one of the most talented bands out there today. Look for their new one, Anthem, coming out soon! Oh, and try counting how many times they say ""woah"" on this CD...crazy....Hope that was helpful!"
5,BEST CD OUT THERE,"After hearing one off the songs on this CD (all my best friends are metal heads), I desided to buy it. After a couple of trips to various stores, I finely fond it. I listened to it once, and then again, and again. I loved it. The songs are great and have catchy words and rythems that will make you want to listen to it over and over. I bought this CD for $..., and let me say, it was well worth it. BUY IT! favorite songs: All my best friends are metal heads History of a boring town Scott Fracas takes it on the chin Al's war Great american sharpshooter"
4,u gotta get this 1!,"""Hello Rockview""...great-sounding release...you've really gotta get it for its ska and rock sound."
4,Their best CD; but not exactly 5 stars,"Less Than Jake's '98 release is a great CD, but it isn't worthy of 5 stars because it doesn't last 40 minutes, some tunes get old after a while, and isn't as much ska as ""Losing Streak"" and ""Pezcore""."
4,more than jake!,less than jake is probably the one of the radist ska bands in the world. i would highly recommend any of their cd's especilly this one. by the way Rage Against the Machine is not punk or ska at all for who ever said that.
4,"by far, the best Less than Jake album yet","okay all you stupid punk rockers, go buy this cd. we all know that this bands other albums have been pretty lame, but this one is great. it is less poppy and more rock, just what they needed."
2,Very dissapointing,"This is not the Less Than Jake I thought I knew. Sure some of the songs are melodic and the singing is still great, but it is too mainstream. It ALMOST sounds like Less Than Jake without the horns, but the guitars just suck. The ska is completly killed on this album. There are no ska riffs on the guitar, and only one little horn solo on the beginning of Nervous In the Alley, which isn't even fast. I guess if you like crap-rock, this is a must!PS If any of you have Losers,Kings... please email me. I dont know whether to get it or not."
4,Hello Rockview,"I love less than jake. My favorite cd in the world is losing streak and i did not think anything could top that but hello rockview comes pretty freekin close. My favorite song on this cd is ""All my best friends are metalheads"". If you like less than jake then you should try out ""the bouncing souls"" they rock too"
5,One of the best ska punk cds i have ever purchased,"Well...I have been a huge LTJ fan for quite some time now and I could not wait for this CD to come out. I was looking forward to it but still slightly skeptical because I thought nothing could beat Losing Streak (their previous CD) but I was pleasantly suprised to see that it is just as great if not better!!! Every track on this CD is great! I would suggest it for any ska or punk fan and probably even people not into that music might like it! The best tracks are ""history of a boring town"" ""great american Sharpshooter"" ""scott farcas takes it on the the chin"" and ""al's war"". This band has a wonderful horn section along with great vocals too and everything else! Plus they rule live so check them out!"
3,"Not the best, but still ok","When I first bought this CD in 2000, i was dissapointed. It just doesnt have the ska sound like in Losing Streak. It is totally more punk than ska, and Borders and Bounderies is the same way, all punk and no ska. Since LTJ is known more for their ska than punk, that was what most people were probally expecting. But if you were a true LTJ fan, I would get this CD, because, well, it still is good, but if you like LTJ because of Losing Streak, then I wouldn't reccomend it along with borders and bounderies."
5,"Gets a big, fat A","A-material. The horns are stronger than in any of their other albums. I hate to say this, but Jessica leaving does even out the horn section. The trombone and saxophone parts are perfectly matched, and complement (or is it compliment?) the songs immensely. Buy this, I don't think you'll regret it."
4,"Less Than Jake, yes, but still...","I must say, this IS an awesome album. The music is great, the lyrics all say something true to LTJ. And yet.. And yet..In my opinion, ""Losing Streak"" is their best album to date. There are some raw parts, and there are some catchy parts. ""Hello"" is very pop, very mainstream in *comparison*. I'm not saying that's a BAD thing, but it's there."
5,This is great ska-punk music that's awesome to listen to,Less Than Jake has put out yet another great album. Good lyrics with even better sounds and the same great humor that Less Than Jake always puts out in each of their albums. This is a great CD and if you like old Less Than Jake you will like this album.
4,less than jake at its best but not as good as losing streak,the new less than jake cd kicks. all my friends are metalheads and history of a boring town are two of their best songs. i like the change from losing streak but i still think thats a better album. get this album-u wont regret it!
4,Emperor of Hemp,"Interesting and informative video of Jack Herer, noted hemp advocate. Well worth watching."
3,Not Long Enough...,It's a bit too brief-- it's the one time in my life where I thought a documentary could of been longer ... It left me wanting more.
5,"Great quality, European style","All the titles in this Andersen series from Europe are excellent in quality and content. I think we bought them all: The Tin soldier, The Snow princess, the Nightingale, the little Mermaid..My son, age 3, likes them all and so do I.Spanish accent from Spain."
2,Not a terrible transfer but not the best DVD,"This DVD release of THE SHOOTING from Passion Productions is NOT the version that comes with trailer and commentary released several years ago. This release has absolutely no extras. Yet, if you can't find the other (as I haven't been able to do), then this version is a decent transfer and it's certainly worth it to see this odd, esoteric, existential Western from Monte Hellman.Let's hope the previously released version with commentary from Monte Hellman, Millie Perkins and the American Cinematheques Dennis Bartok is released again. The commentary for this and RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND were terrific."
3,Can someone please explain the ending? What happened?,"For a low-budget movie, I found the plot of The Shooting to be engaging and suspenseful. But I was disappointed that the ending was vague (who lived? who died?) and the relationship of the bearded man and the woman was never clarified.If someone has managed to figure this one out, please email me and let me know. Thanks."
3,"Millie, what an ice woman","Good movie, although the cowboys in the movie ought to have had less hesitation in slapping that ""Woman"" Millie Perkins to the ground. What a horrible woman."
5,"""Where's the Fish?""","What can you say about a boat flag? Well, this one is cute, well made and easily visible. I am sure we will be using it for many years. Taylor made products last. And of course, Amazon is great with the pricing and getting it to you in a timely manner."
5,Next best thing to being there.,"If you can't actually go to the Aquarium, this really is the next best thing! We try to go to local aquariums whenever we travel and this one is absolutely the best. It's just amazing. Be sure to watch all the special features. You actually get more visuals of the various aquariums from the extras than you do from themain documentary, although the main feature give you all the ""backstage"" stuff you don't get to see when you're actually there."
4,More Flamenco please,"I enjoyed most of the songs but found Nina de Fuego to be more of my liking. I however do love Concha and recommend this CD to all interested in her work. I would like to say "" More Flamenco Please Concha"""
5,Sensational Singer / Great Music,"Concha Buika in the hands of Javier Limon. Two great musical minds. Buika's smokey, silken voice is filled with sincere feeling. She brings a flamenco sensibility to jazz and soul and other genres. Limon's orchestrations and solo guitar elevate the expression. Very wonderful and masterful music. I would also recommend Buika's and Limon's most recent collaboration, Nina de Fuego!"
1,As usual there is a stream after the widely accepted.,"I'm always surprised on how nobody dares to discover when the king goes naked.Every record I hear singed by this woman bore me more than her former one.I really would LOVE to find something on this. But i don't.Someone said ""flamenco redefined"".Really far away from this definition, stand this sound.There are far more consistent names ( both male and female ) deserving that goal and buika is not one of them.If you are lucky enough to fall in a mighty producer hands then almost half or more of te way is done.I'm afraid that is the case here.Listen to Ojos Verdes sung by the first woman to translate it into jazz, Martirio, and try holding Buika version far thanfive seconds if you can..."
2,concha buika mi nina lola,not as expectected. boring. i like spanish music but she looks like crying in her album. maybe she did other better albums!
4,captivating,"i first became exposed to concha buika in 2002 when i heard her singing a fantastic house music dance mix called EVERYDAY and right then i knew this lady had what they call in the biz: ""it"" . She is one of the most gifted and talented performers i have seen in the last decade. her versatility in singing ballad, flamenco,afro-cuban,house,techno,dance,and other genres is amazing and do them all well.Ipredict her the next up and coming. Americans are slow to impress sometimes,but be patient,talent prevails.THis cd is all geared to the slow primitive jazz flamenco compositions all emotive and spiritual. great cd ."
5,great music,the new relics is an awesome band. they have a great sound and put on a great live show too! any one who likes any kind of music will love this band!
2,A SAD LITTLE MOVIE,"Please don't waste your time watching this sad littlemovie. OK, it's directed by a fine director with a finecast, but even given those odds, it wasn't able to impressme in the slightest. The actors do their best with what isgiven to them, which isn't much. Granted, you can't getwater from a stone, but somehow Meryl is able to do soin one scene, which is impressive, given the weakness ofthe script, but her tears do not save this dog (sorry to dragyou into this morass Fido). Even the cinematography failsat points, making me feel bad for Benton (or is it mad?).I actually did feel mad at Benton at the end of the moviefor letting me down. Fortunately, I checked this movieout from the library, which, if you want to back up thisreview by watching it yourself, I would recommend checkingit out. But actually, I would recommend just watching KramerVs. Kramer for the third or fourth time and skipping SOTN."
1,Waste of money,"Wow, I liked My Last Day by Kim Hiorthoy a lot so I decided to pick up his other albums and the only one that sucks is this one. Most songs are complete silence. It sounds like someone brought a mic outside and just recorded. Just listen to the samples and you will see what I mean. I wish I would have listened to the samples before wasting $9 on this album.Hopeness, Melke, Live Shet, and My Last Day are great but For The Ladies is a joke. No actual music on entire album."
4,Nice Product.,This is a good product for the price. My only concern is when changing batteries the adhesive tape might be useless and must be replaced. I recomend it for use in the closed or in the kitchen under cabinet.
1,don't waste your money,"this is a terrible product. The self contained battery quickly runs down & then the unit is worthless. There are similar products that cost about the same, have brighter lights & replaceable batteries"
2,Major problems with this toy,"In addition to the net not staying on the hoop, and the suction cups not working AT ALL, the biggest problem is that the ball does NOT FIT through the hoop unless you push the ball really hard. Rather pointless if you plan on putting the hoop a little higher so the ball can be thrown in rather than dropped in. I will be returning this item."
3,Hoop is good...ball is bad,"The ball just barely fits into the hoop and it's so bouncy that if it hits the rim at all, the ball will bounce out. We're going to try some dollar store balls instead of the ball that comes with it to see if that's easier."
1,Poor Quality,The suction cups do not stay stuck to the glass so it is constantly falling down but the main thing is that the basketball that comes with the net is too big-it does not fit through the net when completely inflated which does not make any sense. I would not recommend.
4,Nice to combine,"I play guitar in a kind of punk band, this pedal is good for those who plays in a band, dont want a lot of pedals, but want them with analog signal, so here you have a nice pedal who combines both overdrive and distortion. The sound when you combine both is very good and dynamic, you can use the color knob to get cool sounds; but when it comes to one effect is not that good. The overdrive has a better sound than the distorion, but when you use the overdrive with low drive the volume of the effect is very poor. As you use the distortion you put the highest pick up of the guitar and put the highest tone on the pedal and the sound is still dark. But at the end is a very good pedal for beginers."
5,Scots Wha' Hae,"I'm a Scotsman, so anything that pokes fun at the English has to be good, but seriously; this book is witty, entertaining, informative, and (as are all Shah's books) full of teachings you're not likely to find anywhere else."
4,Great for the size,"As soon as I saw this was released, I had to have one. I owned this item for almost a year and I'd have to say I have only one complaint. Not enough battery life. But even with that issue, I still love this thing. Simple computer interface with the ease of drag and drop to transfer songs is great. No extra software is needed, which is a real plus. The sound quality is fine, I've been able to listen to it on airplanes with no problem. The navigation while playing is simple enough, though it does take a few steps to change from one album to another. This item is all about the size. This cube is tiny! you hang it around your neck with the supplied headphones and you barely know you are even carrying anything with you. This won't replace your IPod, but it is the most portable MP3 player that I know. Well worth the bucks, this is a great product."
1,Zero Customer Service,"Its a nice product and you will probably enjoy it. As others have stated though, BEWARE their customer service.... there is none. I sent mine in to be repaired/replaced two months ago now, they will not respond to my emails or phone calls.Nice product as long as you don't have any problems with it."
1,"A cute, cool piece of junk","I have bought two of these in the last six months and both have completely stopped working. I am an electrical engineeer with 25 years of experience and can say with confidence that Mobiblu has a class 1 quality issue. I will be returning one to Mobiblu, but judging from the customer support feedback in the other reviews, I will not be holding my breath."
4,Cute and it functions well,"Ive had this MP3 player for over 6 months now and I really like it. At first I thought it was a piece of junk because after a month or so, it kept shutting off and then wouldnt play anything. But I realized that you have to plug it into your computer every so often and do the MP3 update (if you click the right option, it wont erase all of your songs). If you do that, it functions perfectly! The sound is good too.It comes with a neat set of headphones that you can wear around your neck, and its light enough to just hang there.The downfall: I personally dont like the way it looks hanging around my neck (or chest/stomach actually, it dangles down pretty far), but the square design makes it to awkward to put in your pocket or even under your shirt. If you wear it out though, you will get attention...people will be pretty suprised that its an MP3 player. Overall, I really like it."
4,mobiBLU,"I was really fond of the mobiBLU and super excited to get it! However I say WAS because I lost it this past weekend. It was really small and we were on a car trip and I got out of the vehicle to care for a crying child and next thing I know...300 miles later, it was missing. Needless to say I probably won't get it back, but I really liked it while I had it. Although it was hard for me to get to the exact song I wanted. If I had another $130 to spend I would reinvest in a new one."
5,Good Read,"What a fun bunch of stories! Mussler has a good command of the language, as displayed in the last story ""Forever Yours"" with the witty back and forth of the guys playing racketball. These stories go from sweet to surprising. Never a dull moment!"
4,PollenAid,I've been taking this product for about a month now. It seems to be doing what my doctor said it might. I'm ordering more.
2,Help for prostate enlargement,"A friend told me about this becasue it was recommended by his Dr. It has apparently been a big help to my friend. However I've been taking it faithfully for about 2 1/2 months now and have not experienced any relief so far. So while it may be effective for some, it was not effective for me. I will finish my second supply, but will not purchase this product any more unless it begins to make a difference."
2,Oh crap...a mix I wanted is not here.....,"THIS CD WAS SOMETHING I THOUGHT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BECAUSE THE 12"" MIX OF SHINY SHINY WAS A GREAT DANCE TRACK BACK IN 1983 WHEN I WAS A WORKING D.J.BUT THE AUSTRALIAN 12"" MIX WE HAD IS NOT ON THIS C.D. BUT THE INFERIOR AND LAME ""DANCE MIX"" WHICH DOESN'T REALLY RESEMBLE THE WONDERFUL CLIVE WHITSTANLEY/ALAN LANGER 12"" REMIX WE HAD IN OZ.I WAITED 4 YEARS TO GET THIS C.D. SECOND HAND AND IT HASN'T GOT THE ONE TRUE GENIUS 12"" REMIX....WHAT WERE ""RAZOR AND TIE"" THINKING WHEN THEY COMPILED THIS C.D.????""JOHN WAYNE IS BIG LEGGY"" REMIX IS ALSO JUST A PALE REMIX OF THE ONE WE HAD IN AUSTRALIA BACK IN THE 1980S.IF ANYONE CAN FIND THE ""REAL REMIXES"" OF SHINY SHINY ON A C.D. SOMWHERE IN THE WORLD PLEASE CONTACT ME AT: TOMWYNN007 <AT> HOTMAIL <DOT> COMI'M SO SAD, I PAID $82 AMERICAN DOLLARS FOR THIS PILE OF LESS TAHN AVERAGE FILLER.TOM WYNNAUSTRALIA"
1,ripped off yet again,"OK so this is the second time I have ordered a Haysi Fantayzee CD thinking I would finally get the extended version of Shiny Shiny...but NOOOOO this CD contains another version made by some second rate tape editor who just fiddled a bit with the single version and added an extra minute of guff repeated over and over.....YECH!.....the only place so far I have found the real extended version is on an Aussie DVD called Countdown-The Wonder Years. So it looks like the real 12"" of Shiny Shiny is lost to us all. Shame on the person who put this CD out, it is plastic landfill. Sad customer from OZ, Tom Wynn."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this album because I was once a fan of Holdsworth's work back when he was with the British band Soft Machine. No longer having my old collection of vinyl, I decided to take a chance on this CD. Disappointing. His style has obviously changed in the intervening years...and personally, I find this album unlistenable. I can only describe the contents as jazz-fusion muzak, fitting for a fancy sushi restaurant in downtown Tokyo. The only glimmer of quality are the female vocals on disc 2.Overall, a definite thumbs down. Review by Michael Zimmermann (not Svadhina Devi)."
2,This has no appeal unless you love virtuostic guitar playing,"This is not endearing, unforgettable music but... WOW is the guitar playing daring, adventerous, multi-dimensional and exciting. This is an exercise is how many directions a guitar player can take his music."
3,Great music mastered too loud!!!,"I like the selection of tracks on this collection. However the sound quality is impaired compared to some of the originally released versions of these tracks. The mastering engineer used too much compression/limiting when assembling this collection. The sound lacks subtlety and texture as a result. (Try comparing the ""Spokes"" track with its original version on the Secrets CD)Don't get me wrong - this is great music by a great musician. It's just that it could have been sonically better. Non audiophiles are unlikely to notice."
1,[expletive deleted]!,"I thought I would give a real review of this CD, because I used to be a huge fan of Kyuss, the band that started the genre of music that this group belongs to. First off, there is absolutely nothing on this disc that makes you want to go back and hear it through again , unless you are really stoned and you weren't paying attention. There are no hooks or melodies that make you want to play air guitar to or hum along to. It is just a slow, loud, chaotic mess. The drums are horrible, it sounds like the guy has two left hands. The vocals are out of place with this kind of music, and the bass is almost non existent. There are hundreds of bands that are playing this ""stoner rock"" and there are(were) only about two or three that are truly great. This is just another band that seems like they got bored of smoking pot, so they decided to start a band."
5,It's a 5 scoop ice cream cone!,"I initially bought this CD for just the track ""Dirt"", but after listening to the whole CD, I love each and every song! The intro to ""Dirt"" was taken from an annoucement at the original Woodstock...""from now on, this is a free concert."" Dead Elvis is like getting a 5 scoop ice cream cone with all different flavors and you love each and every flavor. I hear songs to this CD played alot as background music on MTV's Realworld/ Roadrules. It has lot's of variety - something for everyone!"
4,Good typing music,"I really liked this CD because it got me in the mood when I was working, like on homework and it kept me awake on those long nights. It was really good to hear music like that."
4,Great CD,"This album takes you on a nice sonic trip. And I do mean trip. this is a headphone album, or a sit and listen album. It is too varied to be thrown on at a party. Great content though."
4,"""Karma"" is a great underground indie single!!!","The beat to ""Karma"" is just mesmerizing: it accompanies the brothers' flows to a T. This song should have gotten more attention than it did. Headz, don't sleep (it's already been slept on), cop this CD Single, it's well worth it!!"
5,Cincinnati's finest by far,"For real though, this single is hot, mood is hella tyte. I've met these cats, and seen them perform live. Help these brothas get some royalties please, cop this single or their LP doom. Any True hip hop head won't be disapointed with either."
2,"Mostly in b&w, static picture, sound could be better","This documentary, mostly in black and white, shows the artist playing violin solo, with accompaniment, or in concerts, but the scenes are relatively static, the quality of sound could be better, and the picture in not much richer than a slightly animated slide show, unless the objective is to see the artist's technique. There is no much advantage of watching this documentary over listening just the music from CD."
4,Swank swing from wartime France,"Michel Warlop""Modernistic: 1933-1943""(EPM Records, 1993)---------------------------------------------French violinist Michel Warlop came onto the booming Parisian music scene of the 1930s as an accompanist for such stars as Germain Sablon and Maurice Chevalier; in his own work he pursued a more swinging style, drawn to the ""hot"" jazz of gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt and his longtime partner, violinist Stephane Grappelli. Warlop also indulged in somewhat riper, more romantic material, popular dance music with an orchestral hue -- this generously programmed album gathers fine examples of both styles. Among the any musicians are Django and Joseph Reinhardt, Alix Combelle, Andre Ekyan, and a host of French jazz and pop luminaries. Nice collection of a lesser-known French jazz pioneer. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To French Music)"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"This book really took me by surprise. I wasn't enthused about reading it, as I didn't really believe it was a spy story. It starts a little slow, but it builds up and up and you're practically on the edge of your seat! The characters are believeable, and the story is gripping. This book gave me a lot of respect for the Polish people and what they went through at the beginning of WWII. Helen MacInnes really treats her audience like an intelligent friend, and her books are easy to read. This one I couldn't put down until I had finished it!"
2,Short and disappointing,"The book doesn't take long to read, but I found it inadequate to tell what is an intriguing story. Its chronolgy leaves something to be desired, and I at least would have appreciated more footnotes, more explanation of the importance of the historical figures who are involved in the swindle, and a more documentary-like account. In my (1958) edition of the Encyclopedia American there is a one-paragraph account of The Humbert Swindle, but in my (1940) edition of the Brittanica I find no mention of the affair. Is this because it involved people who were Dreyfusards rather than anti-Dresfusards? I really think this swindle deserves a better book, tho I suppose Hilary Spurling will say that she has told us all she could find on it. But in view of the extensive press coverage I find that hard to believe."
3,Another scandal of the Third Republic.,"I am interested in the Third Republic period of France, and this book detailed another scandal from that period. The book details the life of Therese Daurignac who married a son of the founder of the Republic. It details how Humbert, his son Theodore, and his wife committed a fraud on the French nation by pretending to be rich when in fact they were peasants with no money. Eventually, their scheme of borrowing money to pay other creditors collasped, and Therese and her husband were sent to prison.If there is a criticism of this book, it is the brevity of it. 132 pages cannot bring to life how thousands of people were cheated out of their money, so that Therese could live the good life. For other books about scandals in the Third Republic, read Prisoners of Honor, The Dreyfus Affair by David Levering Lewis and The Panama Affair by Maron J. Simon."
3,"Great Story, Mediocre Writing","Who was Thérèse Humbert? She was part Heidi Fleiss, part Frank Abagnale, part Don Juan, part politician, part Nelson Rockefeller, part Jackie O, part social Niccolo Machiavelli and part dumb lucky.The tale of Thérèse Humbert's ability to build a career of fame and fortune out of completely nothing is better than Spurling's ability to tell it. A better writer would taken this intriguing story and made it into a great book.To credit Spurling, she did her research well, but she writes with the method of a common feature journalist. The story is strong enough and compelling enough to keep any reader interested.The story, in the end of it all, is a historic tragedy -- a sad docudrama put to print. Quickly read, it totals roughly 150 pages with ample leading and margins.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
3,cool,"this CD is good , I hate israel but I think this singer is originally arabic because of her name , it has some great songs ,give it a try and buy it!"
4,Pyramid is a great game. This version not so much.,"""The $25,000 Pyramid,"" no matter the dollar value, is a great game. Created by Bob Stewart, the man who created ""Password,"" ""Pyramid"" started out in the early '70s and has endured in one form or another ever since.Kind of a rapid fire version of ""Password."" A team of two is given a catagory, and one gives clues to the other to get them to guess all of the terms in that catagory.This home version isn't nearly as good as the several editions that Milton Bradley put out during the initial run of the show. Those can be found regularly on ... auctions. What you would pay for a well kept old version would still be less than this and is well worth the hunt. Endless has done this one on the cheap. Except the outer box, which again looks great, but masks the lack of quality inside."
3,Fun game,I enjoyed playing this game and it was exactly what I needed for a theater production I was working on.
1,Got the wrong one.,"The tubing cutter I ordered is not the one I received. Yes, I know what you are thinking, just return it. Well, I don't have the time or the patients for that. Watch out for this store, I would not buy from them again. The cutter I got is not a nice as the one in the picture. It does work, but it is not a professional tool like the one listed."
2,Needs work,This tool could use improvement. I have one that has a ratchet action that is much better than this one.
2,Not what I expected from the product's description,"This barrette is promoted as being best for those with thick hair. Although the pattern of the decorative 'onyx' is attractive, the actual holding mechanism for your hair is not nearly sturdy enough or made well enough to warrant the price. I could not get all my hair into the barrette at the same time to create a nice, low pony tail. In a nutshell, to all out there with truly THICK hair, this barrette is not worth the money and good luck getting it to do what you want it to. As a side note, I also purchased an inexpensive Goody hair product along with this order. The Goody is certainly not as fancy as the France Luxe but it holds all my hair without any problems and it was less than $7."
2,it was a bit smaller and not quite as sturdy of a clasp,"I purchased this because I was looking for a large barrette that would hold thick hair. I had purchased less expensive barrettes in beauty supply stores, but the clasp was usually glued to an ""anchor"" which was then glued to the decorative piece. Because my hair is so thick, I would usually break the barrettes in the struggle of getting all of my hair in it. The clasp of this barrette appeared to be connected to the decorative piece (rather than an ""anchor""), so, I thought it would work better. At $30, I expected the clasp to be of higher quality than the less expensive barrettes. It was not. The clasp on this $30 barrette was exactly the same, poor quality as those on my $5 barrettes. I was deeply disappointed."
3,Unfortunate change from harpsichord to piano.,"The programme on this CD is beautiful and coherent, and the playing is superb. Unfortunately, Schnittke's sonata, originally orchestrated with strings and harpsichord accompaniment, is played here with piano rather than harpsichord from midway the second movement onwards. Daniel Hope explains his decision in the booklet notes, as due to balance problems with the harpsichord (which I did not notice in the movements harpsichord was used), and to preserve some interesting effects from the original version for violin and piano (which I had to listen to really attentively to notice). Although I prefer the crispness of the harpsichord in this setting, and its easier blend with the strings, the piano does sound good also. The important annoyance, to my ears, is the incoherent change in sound world midway through the sonata."
4,Local Girls give a typical Chick book conclusion,"This book is a nice little read if you are looking for something comforting. Hoffman's book could have easily been rewritten with the title 'Everything will eventually be all right'. A nice little coming of age book, this portrays the story of a young woman as she matures. She conquers many things, such as her parent's divorce, her brothers decline from genius to FoodStar Employee, her best friend's unplanned pregnancy and her mother's untimely death. But, surprise surprise, she comes through it with flying colors and attains everything she had wanted with just a few setbacks. So if you are looking for a nice quaint book, check into this one. It runs the line of a lot of Oprah books, except this one ends well."
3,Coming of age story,"Local girls tells the tale of a young girl named Gretal Samuelson who is growing up with a nonexistant father, an ill mother, an over-involved cousin and an irresponsible brother. Hoffman traces her life from the age of about 16 to 25 in which many things happen to Gretal and her friends and family...as is the case for everyone in those years. Although it is enjoyable and easy to read at first, after about page 130, it gets into a sci-fi mode and then it goes straight downhill. The writing from the beginning is no better than average which it makes up for in a solid story line. When the story line goes to pot, however, the writing becomes unbearable and the book becomes difficult to finish. Good for an in-between book to browse but don't expect much!"
3,Local girl reviewes local girl,"This is a novel about a girl named Gretal and what it was like for her, her family, and her friends growing up. You are with her as she struggles with many issues including her parents divorce, her mother's cancer, love, teen pregnancy, school, drugs, and her brother's death. The setting is a little town where everyone knows everybody, and by the end of the book you feel like Gretals neighbor. It is a book about real relationships, tragedy, and devotion. The plot flows well and you see the characters very vividly. I feel it was a very enjoyable book. It was not difficult to read or to follow. It is filled with emotion of all kind and although the book is a fiction, the relationships were very believable. I recommend this book for anyone who has ever been happy or sad."
3,"Almost, but not quite....","While this book definitely had it's moments, overall, I must say I was rather disappointed. Not quite a novel, not quite short stories, it was terribly disjointed and the change in viewpoints served little purpose. One chapter in particular seemed to be a waste of paper, ""The Boy Who Wrestled with Angels""...ridiculous. I couldn't even care about that character...let alone his downfall. Not a wonderful read, but maybe worth a glance from the library."
2,Depressing. Didn't care for it.,"As a mother to a teenager, I try to read everything on her 'must-read' list. I didn't care for LOCAL GIRLS. It was depressing. What could my daughter possibly gain from reading this book? How to score drugs? That no matter how well you do in school, life will bite you in the behind? If only the writing had been better, there would've been something to hang on to, but it basically blew as well. Very disappointed. Why is a teenaged girl to read this?"
4,Wish there had been more,"I really desired more in this book. I longed to know Gretel more than she let us. I have loved every book that I have read of Alice Hoffman. I love the way she can make you really feel and believe the characters. I reccomend this book to anyone, especially Hoffman fans."
4,A welcome return,"An interesting little collection from a woman whom along with Ann Tyler and Amy Tan is surely one of the premier female novelists in America.These snipets of the lives of Greta and her family are full of the wonder and realism that fill Hoffman's novels. It is true that the decision not to tidy up the narrative does at times threaten to detract from the overall joy of the book, but in the end it still leaves you with a smile."
5,Wonderful,"Beautifully written. A story of surviving adversity isn't a new one, yet Ms. Hoffman manages to do so in such refreshingly simple prose. Though divorce and death has the power to crush many a spirit and writing about it is often somber, Ms Hoffman manages to do so w/ realism, grace. More importanly, however, she also manages to realistically heal its characters and that of the reader. Wonderful reading!"
5,Life Changing,"""Local Girls"" was assigned as our last required reading assignment in my tenth grade English class just before summer vacation. My English teacher reminded us to read the novel carefully, because it was ""symbolism 101"". While I took notes and recorded all symbolic passages, I fell in love with this novel. The quotes, the events, and the characters are why ""Local Girls"" is one of my absolute favorite novels. I bawled reading, my heart and soul ached to read of Gretel's losses, and after 4 years, just looking at the novel gives me chills. This novel definitely impacted my life."
4,Life in Long Island,"Alice Hoffman truly is a great author. She made me feel as if I was there. Gretel, the smart one is the main character in this story was an inspiration to the way she looks at life. She doesn't take things for granted and she sees everything as an oppurtunity. Gretel's best friend Jill is the beautiful one. Jill and Gretel really need each other to in life, they really look up to each other in different ways. Frances, Gretel's mother is diagnosed with cancer after her and husband had got a divorce. Jason, Gretel's brother ends up ruining his life by getting deep into drugs. Everyone in Long Island is basically looking for love. They all find it in the weirdest ways. This book leaves you hanging and wanting to know more."
2,This book is just too depressing!,"This book did not knock my socks off. The short story format within the novel was interesting, and at least progressed in a linear fashion, and Ms. Hoffman definitely writes beautiful, lyric prose. However, the characters just were amazingly depressing, especially because you could see how impaired they were but no one did anything to reach out and help. It's really hard to care about the characters who do nothing to help themselves, or each other... How can a young man accepted at Harvard turn into a grocery clerk cum drug addict in this day and age without anyone at least attempting some type of intervention? Why is it okay for Jill's husband to passionately kiss our heroine while we are reading that the marriage is working pretty well? This book is about wasted lives, and their is little redemption for anyone. Is that the point? I don't get it."
3,"Enjoyable, but wait for the paperback","I enjoyed the book in general, but I felt that there was a lot left unaddressed and undiscovered. It's a good book but save your money and wait for the paperback."
2,More like an outline of a good story than a book.,"Local Girls could be a meaningful story with plenty of quality characters and events, but the author is so brief and jumps from one event to the next in ""outline form"". I wish the author would have gotten more into the feelings of each girl as the events occurred. When the book was over I felt like I had read the book jacket and still needed the heart of the story."
2,Almost but not quiet,"Started off with maximum potential. However the plot never really took off. There wasn't a magor conflict in the story, and I kept anticipating when one would be created. It was defintly a page turner, but only because it got interesting and then nothing really ever happened."
1,a real let down,I really like AH and have enjoyed each one of her magical books. This book seemed like an imitation of her. Not much to it. I don't understand the raves.
2,Too depressing with very little,Started out OK but just didn't quiet take off or maybe I just didn't like the direction it took off too. Either way it just didn't make it for me. Too depressing with very little hope. Read TURTLE MOON instead....it's her best.
3,"Too many snippets, not enough depth!","I do like Alice Hoffman's writing. I was especially enchanted by Practical Magic. However, this story was too abbreviated for me. So many interesting things happen in Gretels's life, yet not enough time was devoted to any one of them to make it memorable."
3,A Nice Short Read,"This is an engaging lttle story and quite articulately told. The book, however, has only 197 pages; and to my way of thinking should properly be called a novella rather than a novel. Many of the pages are blank or contain only a chapter title. I read the whole thing in less than 4 hours, so don't take it on a long trip and expect to be entertained for hours on end."
2,A collection of short stories..,"This book was just that...a novel put together on short stories. While the stories connected and showed the life of Gretel who grows up throughout the book, I just didn't feel that there was enough development of the entire story or the characters.The story is about conquering life..the will to live despite the hard circumstances that exist and I wanted to know more about what motivated the characters, especially Gretel's brother Jason. I realize that with this sort of writing formula you must infer a lot of what goes on but I just needed more depth to the characters.I preferred Here on Earth to this one. I will seek out more novels by this author."
4,A great beach read!,"It is always a pleasure to read a good book. Alice Hoffman is a literary ""witch"" who weaves a little magic into each of her novels. Although this is not one of her best novels (try TURTLE MOON or HERE ON EARTH)---it's really a little too short to explore any of the character's psyche or motivations---Ms. Hoffman has given the reader another pager turner full of glorious prose. She makes ordinary life extraordinary in each of her novels, and she has fast become my favorite author."
4,"A very nice story, easily read in just a few hours.","The abrupt changes in point-of-view from the 1st person to the 3rd person for no apparent reason was rather disconcerting. And the unfolding of events as a series of short stories gave it a clipped and superficial feel. Yet in spite of these ""issues"", Alice Hoffman beautifully tells the sad, coming-of-age story of a young lady and her torn apart family. And in a way, it was nice to use my own imagination and creativity to mentally fill in the details as the story flowed quickly along. As a Long Islander, I think the book is authentic to this area and timeframe."
3,Made me cry,"Gretel and Jill are best friends, growing up in Rhode Island. This novel explores the affect that love has on us all. Our desire for romance, and our need to be loved are dissected and we are shown what we are all willing to do for love, or not do. Meet Franny, Margot, Jason, Eugene, Eddie. There is an incredible scene where one character decides to go out and find, and purchase her own cemetery plot. Made me cry."
2,A Bit Boring,"Local girls was promising, but ended up being a flop. Maybe it was because there were other, better books awaiting me, but the book just wasn't very great. There were a few good, even captivating parts. but, mostly it was full of sections that were much too short (although they felt very long) and did not fully describe the atmosphere of the place where the main character lives. I never truly felt the yearning that she wanted to leave her small, stifling town. As a girl who would like to leave her small town ASAP, I just felt Alice Hoffman didn't deliver."
5,"So Different, So The Same","Just this morning, I was talking about my teen years when I first fell in love with another woman. How I was closeteed, not because I wanted to be, but becuase I had no one to tell. Bars were gone, victim to women's need to pair up and domesticate, soon to fall vicitm to the ""gay virus."" The Internet did not yet exist. I knew *of* Lesbian Pulp Novels, becuase I was capable of doing research, I read so many books looking for myself among them. But I was not there. I am not Lon, or Violet or John or Mary. Now, I look back at these novels and realize I was never in them, but I'm gld to have read them...and glad to let young women know they exist. They may not tell our stories, but that's a good thing.Let us be reminded, and never let it be that way again."
3,"Words, but little else.","I purchased this book for an upcoming trip to Catalunya, and for my own desire to learn Catalan. While the dictionary has served its purpose adequately (i.e. defined vague road signs and words in the hotel), it lacks in two areas.First, there are no pronounciation guides. This wouldn't be a problem, but the only ""Teach Yourself"" book on Catalan also lacks in the area of pronounciation.Second, the dictionary is too abridged. Now, of course adding to it increases the size, which makes use for travel unwieldy. However, if it is going to be marketed to the traveller, then it should contain more travel type words than it does.In short, I would recommend the dictionary to the traveller, but only because its the only Catalan Engligh Dictionary I could find in such a small size. However, the serious student is going to need something more."
3,of limited use to travellers,"Having just returned from Barcelona, we found that this little book was not useful at all. The book is divided in half, first a Catalan to English section and then English to Catalan section, which lists words alphabetically and includes the part of speech and the counter-word, but little else. There is no pronunciation key, which is really important for the Catalan language. Neither were there any phrases or sections of particular use to the traveller. In Barcelona, we found that most people spoke a little English or were able to use Spanish, so we didn't use this dictionary at all. We used smaller books that contained travel phrases and gave some hint to pronunciation instead."
