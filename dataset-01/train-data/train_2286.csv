3,Good farm description,This story is about the sad demise of a farm family and their farm. It is a tragedy and unfortunately there are many such Iowa tragedys.
2,A Thousand acres,"So this book was OK it didn't have to good of an ending like why did Jess stay with Rose and did even say bye to Ginny there was no closeing ,but I would recommend this book to a friend."
3,I guess I'm missing something,"I thought this book does a good job of portraying the lives and the cultural millieu of prosperous (albeit hardworking) midwestern farmers. But the story just degenerated into sensationalism. Possibly I lack the sensitivity to appreciate the incest/recovered memory issues. Moreover, I did not think that the scope of the book and the quality of the writing merited a Pulitzer prize."
3,"Ms. Smiley, write about something else!","The author achieved a clean, flowing manner of writing. The only problem was that I didn't particularly like the subject matter (incest, infidelity, family feuds). I also thought that the main characters (the three sisters and the dad) had inappropriate reactions to things, i.e. Ginny's supposed lack of knowledge hence lack of response to her dad's incest, the dad's completely cutting off Caroline due to Caroline's pronouncement ""I don't want the farm"" (and later forming an alliance with her when it suited his need), Ginny's non-communication with her dad due to and in spite of her dad's mental instability, and Ginny's plotting to kill Rose over a supposed love for a man with whom she had slept one time. Get real!"
4,"Excellent novel, BUT READ LEAR FIRST!","I loved this book. Some have complained (on-line) that it was boring. My guess is that these folks have not read King Lear. I found that comparing and contrasting Smiley's character's etc. with their Shakespearean equivalents made the book very interesting. So, if you're up to it, try reading King Lear before A Thousand Acres!"
2,Needs some serious editing,"The premise is good, and the there's nothing wrong with the overall story -- in fact, I rather like the idea of approaching King Lear from Regan and Gonoril's point of view. However, the first half of this 300 page book is INCREDIBLY boring -- about the most exciting thing that happens in the first 150 pages is the purchase of some cabinets. I understand the need to start slowly and build a sense of suspense, but 150 out of 300 pages? Give me a break! And then in the last half everything happens so fast that it's a little disorienting. In short, the action could have been better distributed. The first 150 pages could have been easily reduced to 50 without really damaging the novel's integrity -- in fact, it would have made the book a lot more bearable to read and a lot more engaging. Sometimes, less is more."
2,A Thousand Acres,"In a nutshell I describe this read as ""a long road to a small house"". Altough Smiley writes well the slow pace to a smarmy and unresolved plotline made me hurry and want to get the book over with not savor it."
2,Disappointing,"Despite my friends highly rating this book, I just couldn't get into it. I found it unconvincing with weak premises and I failed to establish a strong bond with the characters. Very disappointing."
1,Longwinded boredom.,"By the time the author got all the characters onstage I no longer cared about them. The characters were flat instead of fleshed out with something about them to interest the reader. This overblown retelling of King Lear only manages to recommend reading the original, and that is the only thing that recommends this novel."
1,Isn't the Pulitzer supposed to be given for good writing?,"Worst book I've read in 10 years. Here is an actual sentence from the book: ""Jessie lifted his t-shirt to wipe the sweat from his brow, revealing a perfect stomach and chest."" Look for this book at your nearest supermarket."
1,I Can't Believe I Made it All the Way Through!!!,"Mish-mash! No motivation. Whiny, lame characters. The only reason I cared about the characters was in the hopes that their story would be told in a worth-while manner. It gets a two (instead of a one) because I made it to the last 50 pages which held prose of interest. I can't imagine what ""Let's Hear it for Girls"" was thinking when including this novel in its 375 best works. It's hard to imagine the future of our young women growing up thinking that any of the women in this novel should by their ""she-roes."" Real She-roes are Franny from Irving's Hotel New Hampshire and Daisy from Shield's Stone Diaries. I'm still not sure what guidelines juriors for the Pulitzer use for making decision - ""Acres"" can't compare to Stegner's ""Angle of Repose,"" Shields ""Stone Diaries,"" Morrison's ""Beloved,"" or Welty's ""Optimist's Daughter;"" it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath. S. Rea"
3,Not my cup of tea,I couldn't get into this book. I'm not sure if it was just timing on my part or the subject matter. Didn't keep my interest at all.
4,A wonderful..,"book full of rich descriptions making you feel as if you are there. I couldn't put this book down. I do however feel that I didn't understand the dad fully and wanted to know why he was really acting that way in court etc. Caroline's part could have been developed a little more, but that is life! All in all a wonderful read!"
4,excellent,I had to write a brief review to level the playing field. The lone crabby reviewer shouldn't be able to reduce an excellent novel to one star.
2,A thousand acres,DISAPPOINTED IN THIS HAD HEARD GOOD REVIEWS BUT NOT IMPRESSED. was quite boring kept waiting for it to get exciting but that didnt happen.
2,Boring characters behaving inexplicably,"Not one character in this book is sympathetic or even more than mildly interesting, even when his or her behavior is puzzling and implausible. I got the impression that the author stitched together a fabric of characters and relationships and narrative modeled loosely on those of King Lear and then struggled to stretch and poke that fabric to make it fit over the King Lear framework. The result is a drab, boring story saved - (just barely) - only by excellent writing skills."
3,Not the best but not the worst,"I really liked the detailed descriptions behind farm life in this book. The author created very clear visuals for me. The story was decent, at a few times not very believable. The dialogue wasn't written with enough references as to who was speaking. I often had to back up to see if 10 dialogue lines back started with ""I said"" or ""she said"", etc. due to losing track at who was saying which short response. I also think the author fell short on plot twist delivery. I felt like many were downplayed, mentioned in passing. I suppose the aim was to startle you unexpectedly but the technique wasn't pulled off very well in this novel. I got very engaged and wanted to read it (I think due to the rich imagery), but at the same time I would hesitate a bit before recommending it."
1,This Book is Rated R,"I was reading A Thousand Acres it was on the recommended reading list for a Sustainable Agriculture program I am interested in. I was eager to read this book and find out how Smiley portrayed life on a farm. I was excited when I started the book and thoroughly enjoyed the author's style. However, as I read, I was shocked that there was a lot of cussing - I could overlook that though. As I read on, the book contained graphic nudity, complete lack of any kind of sexual morals and it all seemed totally shameless. The worst part is that none of these elements seemed at all necessary (especially to that level of graphicness). I did not finish this book - I didn't even make it half way through. I wish I hadn't read as far as I did as what I read was quite disturbing."
3,a worthy skim,"i didn't like it much - thought it was pretty flat and long and unspecial - a worthy skim. although i thought jane smiley could write well, i felt the whole subject was mediocre and kind of negative - all the characters cheating and lying and double-crossing each other and never being honest...it's like, why would a writer put out such energy to create a quality book about people who just ""live life"", and are on nothing resembling a spiritual journey? Very little redemptive about the book. i guess that's where jane smiley's at on some level...kinda stuck."
2,boring and awful,"I gave this book two stars, because it's not actively offensive, but I found it to be next to unreadable because it is so boring! It's about what happens to these people who live on farms (in midwest America I think) and all sorts of family crises and estrangements. I'm new to the midwest, so perhaps I'm missing something, but I found all the characters to be unintelligent and drippy. They spend a lot of time moaning about, and not a lot of time actually doing anything proactive. It's yet another story about weak, passive women who come to the realization that they are Victims. For baby boomers only."
4,A Thousand Acres,"I have read very similar novel before, which was by Russian author and it was very helpful to understand this story. Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres"" is truly a powerful novel. Although it starts slow, the pace grows quicker and stronger. A Thousand Acres is a novel about a family torn by anger, dark secrets, and avarice. This is a wonderfully written book about a family living during the 1950's on a small farm in Iowa trying to deal with their pain of the past. This novel is a drama to the extreme. The thrust of the story is the relationship between the three sisters as they deal with their monster of a father and his decision to give the farm to his three daughters.After reading this book, I felt as if something had been added to me, as if I had been enlightened somehow. It shows that even the perfect life can have its problems. I became more aware about how a one step can ruin the whole life."
1,Dreadful,"It was a travesty when Smiley won the Pulitzer Prize for this dreadful book, an insipid soap opera masquerading as literature. Smiley bastardizes Shakespeare out of recognition when she turns King Lear into a movie of the week set in the plains of Iowa. Smiley decides to give the ""Oprah"" treatment to Shakespeare: she relocates the responsibility for Goneril and Regan's odious actions from their own sinister personalities (they are two of the Bard's greatest creations) to the Lear character, in this case a (gasp!) patriarch who (what else?) abused the girls as children. By the time you get to the scene in which the daughters, in a laughable excuse for dialogue, announce to each other, ""He abused me!""--""Me too!"", it's all too embarrassing for words."
4,"Compelling reading, great for a summer read.","I didn't even know about the ""King Lear"" parallels until I got well into this book and my mother mentioned it to me. In any case, this book stands well on its own, with well-developed, sympathetic characters. I especially liked that the characters are not perfect but are still likeable even though they are flawed.As a side note, the book is MUCH better than the movie, which also got much hype and acclaim."
3,Certainly not to uplift,"Having grown up in Iowa, I found myself relating the the descriptions of farm life and the habit of continuing life despite any family tragedy or scandal. I disliked the characters and was disappointed that there was no resolution for any of them. It was quite a heavy book and quite often unbelievable."
3,If you like this type of book,"This novel was well written and insightful, but not entertaining at all. This is by no means the kind of book that you ""can't put down"". Though Ms. Smiley had some very good ideas and insightful thoughts, I found the pacing and characters very boring, especially Ginny, who I found to be far too meek for any lead character. I thought her character had absolutely no life or colour. Fought to finish it. I can understand why it won the Pulitzer, but I personally don't agree with the selection."
4,A powerful story of one family,"While this book deals with almost too many issues-incest, infidelity, sibling rivalry, domestic abuse, alcoholism, losing a parent at a young age, just too name a few-the characters are richly drawn against the backdrop of farm life in Iowa from the 1950's to 1970's. The family and ever-present, ever-judgemental townspeople leap to life on the pages of this heartwrenching novel."
2,And this won a Pulitzer Prize?,"The only reason I finished this book was because it won a Pulitzer Price. I kept figuring--it's got to get better. As a fellow midwesterner I found the story and characters believable but not very poignant, entertaining, or inspiring. A lackluster book"
1,Dull as dishwater,"I almost feel guilty criticizing this book since it got the Pulitzer. Almost.I've read other books by Jane Smiley and they bored me too - most of her characters have the bland sameness of university professors and her books have the conception of life's dramas that you get from an introductory level college lit class.I couldn't get through the first fifty pages without suffering narcoleptic fits. I finally gave up and decided that Dorothy Parker could sum up for me - this is not a book to be tossed lightly aside but rather hurled with great force.The Pulitzer committee must've been reading Smiley's press releases about this book, not the actual book."
2,Contrived,"Jane Smiley's ""A Thousand Acres"" is a clumsy retelling of the old King Lear story set in midwestern USA farm country. The story is too contrived at times; odd things happen that seem were written just to make the story fit in with the King Lear premise. There are no characters that I came away caring about; Smiley plays with our emotions too much by hiding important developments until the last minute, and being too quick to send the plot through chaotic twists and turns. It feels voyeuristic; you watch these people's lives but at the end you haven't really accomplished anything. Smiley is a talented writer (try ""Moo"") but this book certainly did not deserve the Pulitzer Prize."
4,A Thousand Acres,"This was an interesting novel that I enjoyed. The tragic events that occur throughout the book stunned me. Some things may seem to be unrealistic but that didn't ruin the story for me. The main character narrates her story and as the ending of the book nears, exciting and crazy events occur. I honestly could not put the book down at points it was so engaging. The feministic views of some characters in this book upset me and that is what makes a book emotionally involving. I would recommend this book to anyone as it is a quick and easy read that will make you think."
4,Very very very very very very strange.,"A good friend recommended this book to me. I'm glad to have read it, but will not likely go back for a second read.Not being familiar with Smiley's other books, I can't say how this one compares. However, as far as this book is concerned, there's some very disturbing elements that make it a difficult, yet engaging, read. Perhaps a little too strange for my taste, the reader cannot help but feel some of the pain the characters are going through.If you're looking for a ""feel-good"" book, stay away from this one. However, if you are looking for an emotionally-challenging book, this is worth one read. (But perhaps not more than that)."
4,Great read,"I chose to read this novel as my ISU novel in school, and I did not regret my decision. I feel that Jane Smiley is brilliant because she is able to create a contemporary story on one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. The characters are well drawn out; Ginny and Rose make readers sympathize with their emotions, whereas in the play they are the evil villains. One thing that was unexpected is the scene when Ginny makes the sausages to kill one of her relatives; I don't think that really worked, but everything else makes up for it. Initially, the story starts out quite slowly, but picks up the pace after Larry hands over his thousand acres of land. Wonderful read."
1,I just don't get it.....,"I have 9 sisters and a mother that are better examples of women growing up on the family farm than the three wimpy, whiny women in this book. I bought it because I thought it might be fun to read about growing up on the family farm; which I did. I had trouble finishing the book but, I persevered......and that is what growing up on the farm is about"
2,Skip it.,This book was extremely depressing. My advice is to skip it completely. Spare yourself the revulsion you will feel after you read it. Trust me this book isn't worth a plugged nickel.
2,"Not bad, but Shakespeare's version was much better...","If you truly like this book, then do yourself a favor and read King Lear. Same story, much better"
1,A 1000 Acre Swamp In Need Of A Drainage Ditch,"I purchased this book because it won a Pulitzer prize for the author; my respect for the Pulitzer committee is now vanishingly small. Perhaps this book could have been a good cautionary tale about the hazards for young women when they do not develop their abilities and instead hang all their fortunes on well-meaning promises of youth. Or this could have been a good tale of how to develop a quality life after experiencing a father with a fixation on being in control, and who prefers to ignore his sexual abuse of his daughters. It might have been a lot of things. As it is, the only lesson I could precipitate from this story is ""trust no one"", which in this case includes the author because the personality profiles drawn in one part of the book conflicts with a later profile of that same personality (authors who uncaringly contradict themselves are themselves abusive, because the time their readers spend in such mush is deemed of no value)."
1,Pulitzer Prize??? .....Wellllll Sooooooo Whaattttt!,"I desperately tried to find this book interesting and struggled to the near end. So much detail was given to settings, farming, unessential nonsense. There was No character building! Boring book, probably even more boring movie! The author writes well but I never did get to know how and why things happened. Boring!!!"
2,Lifetime Movie Time,"Started out as a good idea, I supposed, to update ""King Lear"" to Iowa. But I found the book about as deep as a soap opera, and the language unremarkable. I promised to read it for a friend, and about a third through lost all interest and had to force myself to finish it. I expected more from a Pulitzer awarded novel."
2,A Thousand Acres-prize worthy?,"I, too, found the book to be something akin to a Harlequin romance. I also resent the fact that one reviewer mocked another as a ""silly young girl"" because he/she didn't agree with her review. I thought her review was incredibly articulate and insightful. She sounded a lot more level-headed and intelligent that many adults whose comments I've read. So the book won a prize--that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book that people will enjoy reading. The people that give out those awards are usually looking at more esoteric criteria than the average person when choosing what they consider ""good"" literature. The same is true of any medium (think of how many ""critically-acclaimed"" movies, for example, are bombs at the box office). Many books that have won awards with such accolades as ""masterful imagery"" or ""searing portait of..."" turn out to have little to offer in terms of just pure enjoyment.Thank you, Poor Parallels, for your great review."
2,WHOAH!,"Well, I must say i enjoyed this book, although not from the start, i havent read any others of Smiley's books, but i feel that she took too long to get into the story, i read this book for my literature class, and at the beginning, i regreted my choice, although it did get better as it went on, but as most books, it has its faults."
2,Just okay,"As a work of literary fiction, the prose was not particularly well-written and the characters were at best a collection of stereotypes. Most glaringly, I felt as though this was taking place now and not during the Carter era. Perhaps there was a lot of talk of organic farming, the brain chemistry/causes of psychological illnesses and informing children of the dangers molestation among farmers in the late 70s. I personally do not remember any of those issues being popularly discussed until the late 80s.This is the sort of marginally entertaining book that will hold your attention for the 3-4 days that it will take to read. However, there are far more interesting and moving books out there."
3,Lacking in character development,"This book held my interest enough for me to finish it over the course of 3-4 days (I have two toddlers so that's an accompishment!), but by the end of the book I thought there were way too many unanswered questions, particularly due to poor character development and the relationships among the family members. I kept waiting to understand why Caroline was so distant from the family, but there were only mentions here and there but not enough of an explanation. I feel the author could have added so much more to the story regarding the death of their mother when they were young children. There was no depth or dimension to the characters of Ty, Pete, or Rose. Ginny, perhaps because the book was told from her point of view, was the only character I felt like I really knew. The story had the potential to be better but it was difficult for me to invest in any of the characters."
4,A Compelling Read,"I've heard of references to King Lear but as I read on, I was also struck by similarities to ""Wuthering Heights""...families torn asunder, too, and some outlandish emotions. Dramas played out against an unforgiving landscape, and the sense of isolation. But the detail to every-day life, such as the narrator attending to the process of keeping a farm and farm-house running, both makes it more plausible and keeps us anchored. When Ginny plans revenge on Rose, her actions and methodical, painstaking steps she takes, are ghastly but have a certain dark humor, too. I read this in just under three days, and had to force myself to stop at times, just to attend to details of my own household."
2,Tried my best to enjoy it,"A classic example of what is wrong with modern literature. What starts as an interesting premise (King Lear set in Iowa -family turmoil, etc.) ends up being a patchwork of Opra Winfrey and Jerry Springer episodes, combined with extensive descriptions of farming. If Smiley wanted us to hate the male characters, she succeeds brilliantly, from the alchoholic molesting father to the hippie loser boyfriend who is painfully one-dimensional. A depressing waste of time and energy that has been adopted as a college standard. Read Smiley's Greenlanders instead."
1,"Boring, very difficult to finish!",I was very disapppointed in this book. There were so many major events that occurred yet there was no detail given. The reader does not get an understanding of why the characters act the way they do. I finished it only because I'm in a book club and wanted to join in on the discussion.
2,Who acts this way?,"Incest, recovered memories, alcoholism, marital infidelity,miscarriages, breast cancer, attempted poisoning, family land feuds,cancer causing pesticides - is this a Montel Williams episode and Lifetime channel for women movie rolled into one or what? I read this in a weekend, and not because I particularly liked this refined midwestern melodrama. There are some absorbing themes - I thought the connection between the pesticides that destroy the fertility of the land and the people and the poisonous legacy of rampaging patriarchy that destroys a family was interesting. My principal problem with this book is that people DO NOT ACT the way these characters do. There are explosive scenes between family members, and then days will pass as though nothing has happened. It's as if all of these characters were pod people imitating the emotional life of humans. This book gave me the creeps."
5,An excellent adaptation,"When I first read this book, I was horrified. The first hundred pages were wonderful, then it started getting really really ugly. After I found out if was adapted from King Lear, my mind was changed. This is an excellent adaption of Lear and one of my favorites. Smiley is a great writer, she's exquisite with details and with the really intense relationships that develop in this book. It's certainly not an uplifting story, but one that's I feel is important."
1,junk,These lcd tvs are just junk (can I put NO stars?). Cheap and you get what you pay for.I bought a 17 inch unit and it flickered from the start (I didn't return it immediately because I thought it was a problem with the signal not the tv). When I upgraded to a satellite signal I still had the problem so I called Westinghouse and asked about the warranty..what a joke. They'll diagnose it if I ship it to California at my expense...thanks! No Westinghouse ever again forever!
3,Not too impressed,The cord is too short to be of much use as i can't plug it in and put it where I want to. The bulb was broken the first time I received the item but amazon did a really great job taking care of the return and shipping out another one the following day. As far as the black light itself- I'm honestly more impressed with the actual black light screw in bulbs you can get from home depot
5,Very pleased,"Delivered on-time and in perfect condition. I'm very pleased with this product. It's inexpensive and lights up a large room, with great effect."
1,Broken,"Well I should have read the reviews, but really how hard is it to ship a package? For one you dont use a box 5 times the size of the light and only fill it with a few sheets of packing paper. Its my 21st bday in two days and was hoping to have it light up my room a bit more, but hey maybe i should have just bought it at a store. I sent for a replacement but if it comes back broken again im getting a refund and buying from someone else who is competent enough to handle putting a box in another box"
2,range is very limited,"range is very limited. You have to be close to the bulb to see it working. Depending on the size of your room, go for something more powerful."
2,Disappointingly dim,"Bought 3 for a blacklight party thinking it would at least light up a small room at night with all the lights off. I have to admit, I was disappointed in the brightness - a small 18 inch blacklight I've had for 5 years was brighter than all three combined."
1,No bulb?,It says blacklight tube and fixture but there is no tube. There was a tube covering but no light. Also there were a few pieces of blacklight glass in the box. Complete waste of money. Will return
3,"Cheap chinese product broke immediately, but was still usable","Be careful with those end bits, as one slightly drunken pull instead of a careful twist and disengage will pop the cheap plastic instantly. But if you tape it back down, it'll work most of the time, and having a huge blacklight made parties instantly more awesome!"
2,VERY LOW LIGHT OUTPUT,"The light itself exerted very low light output. I can't tell if it's broken or not, but the tube itself seems to be fluctuating these rib-like patterns across from one end to the other.My generic, 18 watt 2 ft blacklight outputs way more light than this."
4,Alot of CD-Rs,"If you are a enthusiastic burner, and get through a lot of CDs at a time. This is the product you want. I normally get through my Imanation CDs pretty quick because I only get a 20 pack. Now they have made this, I want to get it, because it is a great deal! I have only had one problem where the CD didn't work in the end, but I know how to fix it. With my HP burner, these CD-Rs are better than the TDK. For some reason the TDK just don't have as good enough sound quality as these. Another thing good about this is that you can buy this if you have a burner with a write speed 1X to 12X. Great CDs!"
2,"""A Not-Unhappy Ending""","Stanley Kubrick was quoted in several books as saying, ""I would never argue with (any) interpretation of (my) films.""Smart move. What's been interesting about the criticism of Kubrick's films over the years is the sheer volume and diversity of the interpretations. I remember reading a long Film Comment review of THE SHINING in 1980 that delved into the film's symbolism about America's troubled history of Native Americans and the breakdown of the traditional family.I thought it was supposed to be horror movie.For the most part, I enjoyed this BFI book about EYES WIDE SHUT but I thought the volumes about THE EXORCIST and LAST TANGO IN PARIS were more interesting since they were less abstract about their subjects. This particular take on EYES lost me when it tried to say that the film was from the point of view of the son of Tom and Nicole who hadn't been born yet. Huh?But it's a Kubrick film.And who can argue with any interpretation?"
2,lyman powder drippler,"Disapointed. First have to remove bottom and load with lead shot other wise it tips over. Very, Very slow on measuring out the powder. Have to turn the handle many turns to drop the powder"
2,Ok book,"If you like reading a bunch of short stories, this is a good book. I will agree some of the ""discrimination"" wasn't exactly called for but it didn't play a key part in the book. It's not a novel as it states. More of a combination of different short stories into people's lives. It's a great book if you have nothing else better to do or read."
1,Offensive,"First of all, this is not a novel: it's a collection of stories about people who live or work in the same Upper East Side building. It annoys me when publishers try to sell a book as a novel when it's not one.The writing is good and Ms. Leff clearly knows the people she writes about (her bio points out that she grew up in a building on Fifth Avenue). But what I really minded about the book--what I found simply offensive and bigoted--was the fact that of all the characters in the book (poor, rich, happy, miserable, educated, ignorant) the only two who break the law (and, in the case of one of them, end up in jail) are, of course, the Latin Americans. And we are not talking of poor, desperate immigrants, but of two prominent and wealthy South Americans who break immigration laws and launder money for reasons only known to them. I found Ms. Leff's portrait of Latinos totally unacceptable and offensive, which is the reason I won't be reading her next book."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"The Blue Bistro is the first novel I've read by Elin Hilderbrand, and now I can't wait to pick up her other books. I couldn't put this one down!"
2,Not bad...but,I am a fan of Hillenbrand's books. The book started by catching my interest but fizzled shortly after.Adrienne is trying to escape a bad relationship and to fit in. She is a very likeable character with strong family ties.She steps into a very important role in a restaurant's final season without any training. Her boss is a recovering alcoholic but insists that she drinks with the customers. I felt nothing towards many of the characters. There is no developing of them. At the end of the books I felt like I knew what went on in a busy restaurant more than I knew the characters. Adrienne is attracted to Thatcher (her boss) and then they become a couple. I felt so blah about their relationship because the author tells us nothing of their relationship other than she loves him and they sleep together. She really know nothing about him (and neither did I) other than he has a strong bond to his childhood friend who is the chef.I couldn't wait to get to the boring end.
2,Book was great until the ending.,"I loved reading this book. I learned quite a bit about the restaurant business and my mouth was always watering reading about the delicious meals prepared and served. I'm a huge fan of Elin Hilderbrand's novels. However I felt unsatisfied the way she left the characters relationship hanging at the end of the book. For a novel that I read in one day this was a huge disappointment to me. I suppose we,the readers, are expected to conger up our own ending.If you enjoy reading novels with an ending that leaves the reader hanging, this is the one for you!"
2,I only liked the food,"I feel like I must have read a different book than alot of these reviewers. The only thing I liked about this book was the food descriptions, beautiful. I did finish the story, but felt like these were some of the most selfish, shallow people. I was left feeling flat and depressed. Oh you might think Thatcher was selfless, but I only saw a stilted man, who could only feel one thing at a time. Fiona, was the worst, leading him around like she owned him, she was an awful person. Just wow, even the customers coming to the restaurant werent happy in their lives. Sorry, I cant recommend this unless you like depression with your food."
3,It was just Ok,"I read this book because of the good reviews. This is the first book I have read by this author. I thought it was ok, but kind of forgetable. The ending was not good at all. I will probably not read this author again."
5,Wonderful!,I devoured this book in a weekend. Hilderbrand creates characters you truly care about. I couldn't wait to pick the book back up to see what would happen next. Very enjoyable.
2,disappointing,"I have read many Elin Hilderbrand books. I enjoy them because they are light reads, great for passing time during soccer or dance practice, yet are usually engrossing. THis one just does not ring true. A grown man, so committed to a friend that eschews all other women? Never dates, never goes out? Ane when he does fall in love, he tells his love interest she will always come second and she agrees? Would this ever happen?? HIs devotion is lovely, but I just can't imagine is being real. And what type of person would hold him, refusing to marry him or have a relastionship because she is dying, yet keep such a hold on him that he can never have a relationship with anyone else? I found myself not liking any of the characters. Fiona is selfish, Thatcher can't make a firm commitment, and Adrienne is a doormat. Not one of her best, in my opinion."
2,predictable,I do enjoy reading Elin Hilderbrand but unfortunately I'm finding once you've read one you've read them all. I do not think I will be purchasing another Hilderbrand book :(
3,So So,"Enjoyed the book- wasn't one of my favorites of Elin Hilderbrand, but none the less I enjoy her style of writing. Easy read"
2,Unbelievable,"This book came highly recommended, so I stuck it out to the end. I liked the restaurant's back story. But the main characters never seemed real to me. The chemistry just wasn't there in this love story. Actually their relationship seemed creepy!"
1,Never again,"..will I waste 100 pages reading a book like this. I have never been so bored in reading anything before and I have read some pretty boring books. The characters are dull and the storyline is null and void. I was hoping, as some others reviewed,that this would be a light, good, fun read and it is not. It's just boring."
1,"Read this book if you like shallw, selfish characters","I purchased this book at the end of July for my vacation .. saw it was a `good beach read' .. yea right .. well September is approaching and I just finished it - in fact I made myself finish it. I read all the 4 and 5 start reviews and wondering if I read a different book than them. The characters in this book were the most shallowest, selfish, self-centered characters I have ever meet. I live in Massachusetts and we are not this kind of person. On top of all this the ending was awful ... it kind of just ended. This was the first and last book I will read by this author .. glad it was rather cheap!"
4,Blue Bistro but RED Sox,"This was a well-crafted story that kept me coming back for more. I loved the Nantucket aspect-- terrific setting-- transported me to summer. Also enjoyed the food descriptions and wished the restaurant was real so I could go there some August. Oddly, I couldn't form a clear picture in my mind of the two main characters, Adrienne and Thatcher, but I was interested in their journeys regardless. I think the author could do a better job differentiating between the dad and love interest in terms of dialogue (they almost seemed identical character-wise). Gripe: she writes about the White Sox at Fenway; this book takes place in Massachusetts-- it's the RED Sox!"
4,Great Beach Read!,Very moving story. A great beach read leaving you wanting to keep reading to find out more about the mysterious characters.
2,"Great food, bad ending.","I live in Massachusetts and was really looking forward to reading a book set on Nantucket. I found the description of restaurant life to be very interesting, but the rest of the book left me wishing the characters weren't so damn depressing. I saw NO chemistry between Adrienne and Thatcher, and even less between Fiona and Thatcher. I really didn't like Thatcher at all, in fact LOL. I think there was overkill with regards to Adrienne's past, and more about her relationship with Thatcher and what made them so attracted to each other, because I couldn't figure it out. I'm hoping the next book I read from this author is better."
3,"good summer, beach read","3.5 starsThis story is about a woman named adrienne who goes to Nantucket to start a whole new life and ends up finding not only a brand new career but a brand new life as well. She is immediately offered a job as assistant manager at the blue bistro which is one of nantuckets finest restarants. She is soon drawn to Thatcher who is one of the owners, but his unique friendship with the other owner Fiona always seems to get in the way.I did really enjoy this book but found it a little predictable. The characters were all unique and I liked them but the storyline itself I guessed all along. I did enjoy elin hilderbrands writing style and would def. Be interested in checking out some more of her titles."
5,Loved It!,I've read several of Elin's books and I think this is my favorite. I loved the relationship between Thatcher and Fiona. Such a vivid description of the meals served at Blue Bistro. Hated to see this book end. Would love a sequel.
3,not the best of Hilderbrand,Elin Hiderbrand is usually a can't put down read. This was slow with the characters not developed enough to like or dislike them.
4,Couldn't put it down,Not your typical summer romance novel but great nonetheless. I gave it four stars only because the ending is sudden and vague for the reader.
5,Love it!,I have read this book a few times and it is still definitely a favorite of mine. I love the relationship between Adrienne and Thatch. I love the relationship between Thatch and Fiona. I found it hard to put down and a very worthwhile read.
1,DO NOT READ,"The Blue Bistro is an abysmal book. I picked it up because it looked like a nice, light summer book, but I stopped 80 pages before the end. Although the description of the restaurant business was interesting, I did not like any the characters and there was absolutely no chemistry between Adrienne and Thatcher. Overall, I was incredibly disappointed that I had wasted my time."
3,VERY disappointing,"I could hardly put this book down. I loved the story. I did feel like Thatcher and Adrienne were not meant to be (someone else described them as having no chemistry, and I agree.), and I wasn't interested in the details of the cuisine. But, I still loved it.The ending? A complete disappointment. It left me hanging at the end. I actually thought maybe the last chapters were missing from my copy. I've read a couple of really bad books that had such a great ending that it was worth the trouble of having gotten through the whole book. This book is the opposite. The ending ruined everything."
4,Hard to put down!,"This was my third novel I've read by Hilderbrand and so far it's my favorite one. I enjoyed the character of Adrienne, who has moved to Nantucket with the goal of earning as much money as possible. She was encouraged to work at the Blue Bistro even though the has no restaurant experience. I enjoyed watching her learn the quirks of the business and develop a relationship with the owner. I took this book everywhere with me! Very hard to put down. I found the ending a little awkward and for that gave it 4 stars."
4,Great read,"The Blue Bistro is a love story that keeps you engaged throughout the entire book. The relationship that builds between Adrienne and Thatcher is rocky, but because of this relationship with Fiona. At times it is frustrating as to why Thatcher refuses to let go and fall completely in love with Adrienne."
3,Not her best by far,"This book never grabbed me. I was somewhat interested and did finish it, but I agree with other reviewers that the ending was flat. It left me saying - What? One big event was very predictable, the rest, unsatisfying. I do think this author has improved immensly since this, one of her earlier novels. I think I'll stick with her later works, and skip the others."
5,Loved it!,"I love summer beach reads and this is one of my favorites! not only did i enjoy the story but the part about the restaurant made the book special. Very cool to see all the different roles everyone plays to make a fantastic ""show"" every night. Really love Elin Hilderbrand, her books get better and better each time!"
3,Easy breezy book to read...,"It was okay, not something that I will read again. The story was good, a bit vague in areas. Like most of the characters, and the story line was simple. Not many surprises. Easy read for the summer."
3,"Light, summer read","This is my first novel from this author -- I merely wanted a light, summer read and loved the idea of the restaurant setting. But I almost quit reading about a third of the way through because it was so claustrophobic. Poor Adrienne seemed stuck at work forever, the plot seemed to be going nowhere, and I wanted OUT of the restaurant myself! There seemed to be a lot of drinking going on throughout which was annoying, especially toward the end. I was also disappointed that I didn't learn much about the restaurant business and the it was just the same food over and over. But the book mostly held my attention and the characters were mostly likeable interesting."
4,Could not put it down!,"This was my first EH book. I loved it...could not put it down. The relationship dynamics are deep and complicated. However, the ending was rushed. However the book was SO Good it took me a Month to get over it! Deep stuff! Wish there was more to the end."
5,The Blue Bistro by Elin Hildenbrand,This was a very engaging story that I found very enjoyable. I especially recommend it to fans of Elin Hilderbrand.
5,My favorite CD of all time,"I bought this CD and immediately fell in love with it. This is a very fun musical and so romantic to listen to, perhaps because of the French language. The lyrics are heartfelt and beautiful and Damien Sargue, who plays Romeo is extremely talented and has an absolutely amazing voice! The best songs are Verone, J'ai Peur, Les Rois du Monde, Les Beaux, les Laids, Et Voila Qu'elle Aime, On Dit Dans La Rue, and Avoir une Fille."
4,got me!,"I am not the most romantic person in the world... rather down to earth and no non-sense, but this musical really got me. The feelings are expressed in a way that sounds true without being ""soapy"". It is a very moving piece... God knows I would be put off if I found it ""gooey"". Even my friends who do not always understand french, love it and find that the music and the voices alone will lift you up somehow."
1,blah,"how do i describe this soundrack? i really cant think of words to describe how bad it is. I mean, this is so bad, I laugh at it when i hear the music. but perhaps my vision of this soundrack is skewed since ive seen the production in Paris last spring, although I did hear the soundtrack before I saw the musical, and hated the music then. Let me put how I feel about the musical in this way: it is the only play/musical that I have ever seen that I wanted to walk out of, mostly due to the fact that the music made me want to vomit and the choreography and costumes were horrid."
3,not his best,"This is not L'Amour's best book, by any means. The main character is unrealistically mature, even as a child. I frequently had trouble determining how much time had passed between chapters. The early chapters seemed to be during the late 1830s, while Johannes was a preteen, but after they got to California he was presented as an adult at least in his mid 20s, which would have put the action during the late 1850s. However, the action described reflected the situation in California during the 1840s, before the US took over that territory. Also, there were too many philosophical asides, some of which reflected beliefs that did not become known and accepted until later in the 19th century. In the 1830s-1840s almost everyone was a young-earth creationist. All in all, if you are interested in California history during the transition era you might like this book; otherwise, skip it."
4,Exciting Story of the West,"19th Century California revealed in an entertaining, smartly written tale by a great writer. L'Amour includes all the ingredients of a riveting tale in The Lonesome Gods.From beginning to end the story is full of action and intrigue with characters that run the gamut from good to evil, simple to mysterious, heroes and villains.There is nothing disappointing in the novel. The only shortcoming for me is the hint of the ideal in the protagonists. The father and son and heroine seem too good and well-rounded to be true. I think the protagonists fulfill the roles of an ideal man and woman by doing the right things, being independent, strong fighters, and also philosophers and full of wisdom. The one fault in the development of the protagonists is that they are faultless.Besides this one sliver of criticism, this book offers exceptional, eloquent writing and a superb story.This book will transport you to the time and place as it captivates and entertains."
1,I bet they're lonesome,"This is only the second L'Amour novel I have read, the other being Hondo (1953). It is absolutely amazing to me that an author can spend thirty years telling stories and forget more than he learns about storytelling. Sadly, The Lonesome Gods is inferior to Hondo in every respect, especially brevity.But if you like a transparent plot, cardboard characters and dialogue lumpier than cold chuck wagon oatmeal, this may be just the novel for you. Remember, ""They're good people, but...""."
1,Another wild west story,"Unimpressive book about a teenager who is able to out smart the ""dumb"" indians and californio's. Pretty offensive actually. While the names of early Los Angeles are used, the story is set in the Texas landscape. Truely a waste of time."
4,Should be 4.5,"This was one of L'Amour better books. I loved the way we grew up with Johannes. This book was well written (I didn't give it 5 stars because there were a few parts I rolled my eyes), but other than that, worth the read.The spirituality the desert and Indians brought to the book was one of my favorite parts. There is life bigger than us - L'Amour was able to express it in an entertaining way.Unlike one of the other reveiwers I felt he expanded on the characters of the book - and the last 50 pages or so I couldn't put it down - always a sign of a good book."
3,"Ok, but not what I expected","Louis L'Amour is a great story teller, but he lacks depth. The book has about 10 storylines that somehow all come together in the last few pages. I do not agree that the characters are realistic. It is a good entertaining book if you like westerns, but the writing and development could be better."
4,My Two Year Old Enjoyed It,"Checked this out from the library and my two year old loves it. It is easy to read and has colorful, expressive pictures that are interesting to look at, even the 16th time in a row. I plan to use it with my 2 year old class to teach/ introduce the idea of ""One"". My 2 year old quickly caught on to holding up her ""1"" finger with each ""one more"" spoonful. Nothing earth-shattering, but a pleasant read showing a positive mother-child interaction."
3,"Good price, mediocre product",doesn't look as good as those round ones.lid opens with little effort since there's no handle.price-wise is okay...
1,"""Tai Chi for The Elderly"" is more like it","I was so let down by this DVD that I almost gave up on Tai Chi. Why they chose a cast of people that were all over 50 is beyond me. I guess it's to appeal to that demographic. Paul Lam speaks too slowly and the group of seniors (to whom I mean no disrespect) move akwardly, out of sync, and barely stay 'true-to-form'. I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone who can stand up on their two feet at a moment's notice and walk up and down stairs without help should look into Kathy Smith's DVD. For those of you who are finding it hard to gain mobility - this is the DVD for you. I did not mean to offend so forgive me if I've been rude."
1,Really disappointed,"When I've bought the DVD, I was thinking about learning Tai Chi. The training has too much dialogue and I was thinking about learning the 24 forms; the problem is the DVD only teaches the 6 moves needed to learn Tai Chi and 3-4 Qi-Gong moves. This DVD is ideal for someone who wants to pay a DVD more than 30$ for nothiWhen I've bought the DVD, I was thinking about learning Tai Chi. The training has too much dialogue and I was thinking about learning the 24 forms; the problem is the DVD only teaches the 6 moves needed to learn Tai Chi and 3-4 Qi-Gong moves. This DVD is ideal for someone who wants to pay a DVD more than 30$ for nothing. I really don't recommend it."
2,Too much dialogue,"I bought this DVD to engage my 92 year old mother in some simple, introductory exercise. I have done Tai Chi in the past and thought she'd enjoy it. Paul Lam's style involves visual example and verbal description, and the older participants he uses were good for her to identify with. However, even on the first viewing the amount of dialogue made it difficult to deal with, left my mother & I standing and waiting impatiently for him to move on to the next pose. Since with DVD you can't fast-forward past the dialogue, it would have been better to demonstrate the moves without so much discussion before going on to putting the sequences together."
4,Good start for Tai Chi,"In reading some of the reviews, I can't help but think some are missing the point. While I am only in my early 30s, the silver-hairs did not distract me from learning Tai Chi from this DVD. While some of them don't move as smoothly as some can, Dr Lam does move quite well and provides an excellent example of the proper form. As for the dialogue, after you listen to it a few times, you should be able to do the moves at your own pace and if you get ahead of the DVD, simply stand and meditate and wait for it to catch up. I use the remote on my DVD player to rewind and fast forward so I can do things at my own pace. If you are starting Tai Chi, this DVD should work for you. If you are more experienced, then this may bore you quickly. All I know is that I have slept better in the last week than I ever have (I do Tai Chi at night, right before bed). I now awaken fully refreshed before the alarm goes off!"
2,Laura Pozzo,"The front cover of the book tells us that ""Laura Pozzo"" is a pseudonym. And I believe ""Laura Pozzo"" doesn't exist at all but the author made her up."
2,good info but dont pay more than 0.99 for this title,"this book is a 5 page excerpt from the book, ""How to make money selling books on Amazon"" which is what you want to buy if you are looking for info on how to sell books on amazon."
1,Very generalized,"I bought this book to help deal with my 6 year old's nightmares. There wasn't really anything about that in the book. I thought the name implied the book would mostly be about bedtime fears but really it is a generalized book about 30 or so fears a child may have so it really didn't help me at all. There doesn't seem to be depth of analysis of any of the fears and I can't imagine the book would be useful to many people.I don't necessarily think this is a ""bad book"", I just didn't find it helpful for me and don't see it really being helpful to most people, but if you just want a book with a little bit about a lot of fears, this would be a very good book for you."
3,Wimpy,I guess that's the way to describe this lock as I wanted something on the bigger size. I plan on keeping it as I did buy it but more for back-up
4,Works for me!,"Product works as intended. i have no problems with it. I find it easy to use and the orange reminder cable is a must!! i almost rode off with it on, sometimes you tend to forget.Great product!!"
1,Stopped working,I purchased this from WalMart for $20. The lock failed to open after 2 weeks of use. I managed to open the lock with some difficulty but I won't use it once I get some other disc brake lock. This lock is heading to the trash.
2,My backup Lock,This lock feels flimsy to me and I worry that it wouldn't take much to remove it. I use when I'm at the grocery store but wouldn't trust it for higher security when parking my Vespa on the street. This lock is light weight and easy to install. I like the cord and use all the time regardless of the lock used.
2,"Works for short while, if oiled","Purchased this as a replacement for a Bully lock. Liked the low price, trusted the name. Shouldn't have.This did not get one star because it did work out of the box. This is not an outdoor lock, nor is the mechanism sound, even new. Without taking a photograph of the inside, the individual plate tumblers aren't spring loaded, and dont reset, which means that the key wont even fit all the way in.All locks rust, but this lock seized up almost immediately. WD-40 left it working for a while...until that dried out. You could use this lock if you sprayed it out once a week, and didn't leave it outside...you know, on your motorcycle.The metal quality seemed fine, but I couldnt use it enough to find out. The metal for the key was extremely soft and bent under normal pressure when trying to unstick the lock."
3,"Nice lock, questionable warranty?","So I have to send my motorcycle VIN serial numbers, a bill of sale for my bike, and provide all my insurance company information just to receive a $1,000 warranty that only covers me if the lock is compromised and only up to one year? No thanks."
1,Does nothing but look like a lock,This lock is broken easily with the weight of the vehicle and a thief !! it is like not having anything at all to anyone who has stolen a bike before !! do not buy this unless you wish to give away your money.
3,Picture is actual size.,I didn't think the lock would be so small. This would be good for scooters but not sport bikes. I use this as a secondary lock. I would never trust it by itself. The size of the picture is literally the size of the lock.
2,sort of works,"This sort of works, I have to fiddle around with the lock for it to open , I spent anywhere frlm 1-2 min getting it open, it sucks"
2,Center pin issues,"Center pin is kind of thin. i pushed my bike and didnt realize it was locked. The wheel turned and the lock did what it was supposed to do, it stopped the bike, but when i removed the lock and inspected it. i saw the locking pin was bent, so i hammered it back stairght, it locks the bike but i think if i started the bike and throttled it, the lock would probably fail."
5,Teacher,"I havent read this book, I plan to. Scott Hicks was my Latin Teacher, which is strange to hear he has a book out, so im definately gonna be reading this"
4,A trial run for Amelie,"If you've seen Amelie, you will recognize the ""revenge through petty things"" theme in this movie. A jilted young girl teams up with two sisters who con older men out of their wallets, together they conspire to ruin her former lover's life.The movie is well done, but lacks the maturity of Amelie. The concept works, but, at times the scenarios are a tad too contrived.Worth watching"
3,Complex tale about a dedicated teacher,"My favorite part of this book, a long complex novel about human themes like love and betrayal, set in a school, is the list of books that one of the teachers wants to have as required reading:""1984. That should be required reading for all the ignoramuses. That and Fahrenheit 451""""Banned. Both.""..""Removed from the school library shelves ...along with Huckleberry Finn, Brave New World, A Farewell to Arms. The Catcher in the Rye, The Merchant of Venice...""and the list goes on. Every book that has something to teach on the human condition. What better way to illustrate conflict of progress versus the establishment than that list."
5,An involving and complex saga about the human condition,"Set in a public high school in upstate New York, starting in the year 1980, Those Who Give is an involving and complex saga about the human condition, as Alyssa Matthews, Jean Tevarro, and Bonnie Mason are caught up in the conflicts between greed and ethics, love and the fear of heartbreak. With a wicked string of irony running through turbulent passions, Those Who Give is commended as being a deftly written and sharply insightful novel, as author Rosemary Cania Maio combines tragedy with comedy, history with prophecy, celebration with indictment, and epic storytelling with memorably identifiable characters."
5,Beautiful cookware for a lifetime,"I own this exact same product and love it. It is very beautiful and quite large. It can handle dishes even for large gatherings. The interior is gray so it wont stain. It holds heat and is great to take to an event just leave the cover on and carry with oven mits. I always receive complements because you can tell it is high-end cookware. Clearly this is a piece I will have for a lifetime, there is just nothing you could do to damage it. I spray the inside with cooking spray and always hand wash it quite easily. It is an investment but you will love it too! I make roasts, potatos, mac and cheese, lasagne, ziti, roast vegetables etc and have not trouble. It is sturdy as a rock a bit heavy but quite manageable."
2,Runs SMALL! Not a little but alot!,These are not True to size. Do not order unless you order up a size or two. I ordered a 31 fit more like a 29! Wish I hadnt ordered these. Guess they will get passed on to my daughter who does not need more clothes! I DO!
4,Buy a size bigger!,"I love these jeans. I first bought a pair in vintage wash, and had to get another pair. Fits great, hangs on the hips, gives a really flattering bottom, and ends with a nice slimming silhouette. Well, at least I think so!Thanks to some of the other reviews here, I bought this in one size larger and it fit perfectly.Great value for money!"
5,Definitively worth the buy,"If you're a fan of Futurama then this is a must have. This includes all the seasons, except for the ones that were aired on Comedy Central, and all the movies. The bender head is awesome too and should be displayed with pride. The only problems are that the DVDs don't have a play all feature and it doesn't include the recently released seasons, but it is a must have for any fan."
3,Baffling decisions at the production level,"I love this series, while I always felt that the Simpsons was superior due to its rich cast of characters and terrific writing, Futurama is just as good in every other way. That said, how can those in control of DVD production justify the decision to not include a ""Play All"" feature in its first two volumes and NOT add it in for this repackaging? My guess is that if a ""Man on the street"" survey were taken, 95% of the respondents would know to include this feature yet those who I assume were paid very well for the DVD production could not get that most basic principle worked into their decisions. Totally inexplicable."
4,for true fans,"i bought this Bender head for $107 with my tax refund. best decision ever :P haha. it is a great bender head. the little antenna is in a little area right above it so if u keep it in the box you can't see it, but i recommend that you do keep it in the box so it can look like those heads with the water in them. plus its a cool box to keep. the dvd's do sometimes get stuck so i just decided to put them in a cd case holder and put the head on dislplay. the reason i gave it four instead of five stars was cause the dvd's get stuck and because sometimes its a little hard to open the Bender head. it includes all the episodes and movies! i really love it."
2,Damaged discs both times,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and we were both very annoyed when we opened it. None of the discs were in their slots, they were all over the place and sure enough, two were bent and didn't work. I contacted Amazon and they did an excellant job working with me, so we exchanged it but had the same problem with the replacement they sent. We knew it was going to happen before opening because the box looked damaged. This time, three discs were bent but luckily, they were different ones. So we just traded them out till we had a full set of usable dvds."
4,Awesome Collection,"This collection is awesome. Only problem was when it arrived, all the disks were out of there slots. Not sure who's fault that was, Amazon or UPS, but the disks stil play great. Some of the disks also don't have a play all function. About half of them do and half of them don't. Would be nice if they all had it. Overall, a great buy."
5,Perfect,"The only downside I see in this product its how hard its to take a dvd out and put it back in sometimes.Other than that, the case is really high quality and its design is beautiful. I'd recommend this to all the futurama fans that don't already own it."
5,Futurama Complete Collection,I ordered this collection for my husband's birthday. I was worried after reading the reviews that it was going to be hard to open and difficult to insert the dvds. I was very relieved when it came and I saw I had worried for nothing. We had a lot of the individual dvds from earlier purchases but we love the Bender head storage/display. I would recommend this collection for any Futurama lover.
5,A time to Re-Bender!!!!,Great collector's gift all first four seasons of Futurama plus the four movies. The packaging is incredible!! A life-size head of Bender with all the discs inside that can be opened from behind. A must for every Matt Groening's fan.
5,Good news everyone!,"Futurama is one of those shows that goes beyond just being an entertaining TV program. One can find themselves quoting a line without realizing it in just about any scenario the day can bring. Finally the show is all together in one incredible aesthetically pleasing Bender's head case. Inside of Bender's noggin lies 4 seasons and 4 movies of one of the most entertaining and intelligent shows in the history of television. The set lies proudly on my living room shelf for everyone to admire. Do yourself a favor, buy this set now before they run out. Only a limited number were made and no fan should have to live life one more day without having bender's shiny head in their home staring knowingly back at them with the promise of hours of unadulterated entertainment."
5,"I love Futurama, but this collection is not user-friendly","I'll admit that I am a total Futurama fanboy. I love anything and everything Futurama. I already own the 4 seasons and all the movies on DVD, but when this complete collection came out I said ""me want!""*UPDATE*: I originally complained that there was no episode guide; however a helpful Amazon citizen posted that there is an episode guide in the box... thank goodness I didn't throw it away!"
3,AN O.K. BOOK,"This book wasn't very good, but it wasn't horrible. It could have been MUCH better and it is much better than some of the other Black American Series."
5,"SIMPLE, ELEGANT MIX OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY, INCREDIBLE UNSPOILED SCENERY AND ACTION","In the first ten minutes I thought it was just okay;then it did nothing but get better for the next 177 minutes. Director King Hu was a visionary;no wonder so many contemporary movies have explicitly and liberally lifted his ideas.Unlike so many martial arts' movies, character reigns;the plot is intricate, evolving and and motivates the action.And the natural locations make me want to take a very long walk around China. A feeling of reality and naturalness prevails in every scene.If you buy this, and you should, read the bio of King Hu Jing-Chaun; amazing what he's done and the lasting impact of his work. His genius really shines in Touch of Zen."
5,5 star film - 0 star DVD,"But do not let this keep you from buying this, get it while you can because this could be the only DVD version this film you will ever see. It really does anger me, the big gripes here are not so good audio and during the night scenes you really have to strain to see anything. Serious martial arts films that don't star Bruce Lee are always getting shoddy cheap releases and something should be done but you know nothing ever will.Other than that this a great film, one of the greatest films. I am sad that this film is pretty unknown even by most hardcore martial arts and even fans of Asian cinema, this film deserves a full blown 2 disc Criterion release. Oh well, see this dvd and hope one day it gets a real release."
2,Waiting too long for English,"This movie was released in 1969 which makes it thirty six (36yrs) years to this date, and there is still not an ENGLISH version. I was so ""pi...pi...pi...pi...piss-off"" when I popped in this DVD and .......... Movies are meant to be WATCHED not READ. Otherwise, this movie seems promising.And Amazon, can you PLEASE put an alert on DVDs that are not in ENGLISH....especially foreign films. This would be a BIG help."
4,Lotus Smartsuite 9.7,"Lotus Smartsuite 9.7 is a nice upgrade for the Lotus users.It has powerfull utilities that make the intagration of files from other programs a snap.The installation process and compatablity with Windows 2000, XP and ME not a problem.4 stars from me"
4,Basic but does the work,"It is a basic unit, but it does its work (making you sweat).The little computer helps you to keep track of you exercise routine.Easy to store.No specially noise as I read in another review."
4,Nice but squeaky,"I have been using my XL Stepper for a month or so. I am pleased that it is very solid, sturdier than the mini stepper it replaced. That stepper had a cable that broke; this stepper is designed without a cable, so it does not have that ""weak link."" The step and calorie counter has worked fine from day one.The only complaint I have is that this stepper has squeaked badly since soon after I got it. I have sprayed it liberally with WD-40, but the problem persists. Occasionally it goes through a few minutes without squeaking, but most of the time it makes noise.Overall I am happy with this device. It helps me get regular exercise, improving my heart's health and keeping my waistline under control.Update April 8, 2008: After a few months, I finally tried a teflon lubricant from a bicycle shop. Applying this to the bolts is very effective in eliminating squeaking. I have found that an application every month or two is adequate."
4,Did the trick,"The steel could be a bit harder as the star edges wore pretty badly on the first use, albeit a tight lug."
4,Great for occasional use,"I thought these would be a little larger, but they are rather small. Still a great buy, and handy to have. I know the write up says they are tough, but I am skeptical to put them to the test."
5,Just what I needed,"Purchased two, one for home shop and one for my truck toolbox. Works great to remove seats and interior parts on my old YJ Jeep."
4,Cheap wrenches.,"They worked for my intended purpose but do yourself a favour, spend a couple of extra bucks, and buy the socket set of star wrenches. I used these to chance a lift gate support on my Jeep and it took an awful lot of cranking. Plus it stripped the bolt on one of the supports so i am unable to crank it down any further. I do realize this is mostly my fault but these wrenches are an off brand and not constructed very well."
5,Very Nice,Nice high quality set. They make a great addition to any tool set. Just as good as the tool truck brands for a fraction of the cost. Buy them. . . you won't regret it!
4,A Nice Coloring Book for Golden Books Character Fans,"This is a nice coloring book which features three stories about the Tawn Lion, Poky, and Tootle the engine. The stories are actually quite good for a coloring book. The art is simple and there is a good variety for coloring fanatics from big pictures that are easy to color to more detailed pages for the more adept coloring fan."
4,Phenomenal help and guidance for ABA / DTT behavioral therapy!!,"First, if your autistic child or client is not able to speak, do NOT use this book as most lessons require a child to be able to have some prior language skills. Although I may not agree with the exact order in which to target each lesson goal, mixing the sequential order to accustom it to how your child or client is able to grasp concepts the quickest is still possible. This book provides cards and customized blank sheets for you to copy and use, as well as various scripts! I am currently a behavioral therapist and purchased this book to help me out with creating new targets. If you are buying this book and have never done ABA or DTT data collections, this book might seem a bit overwhelming at first... BUT it is not impossible. The challenge arises from consistency."
5,This book is absolutely amazing!!!,"As an educator for children with autism, I read A LOT of books because my job is to learn skills and strategies in order to train people. One of the most requested things that teachers need help with is how to teach social skills to their students on the spectrum. This is by far the best social skills training manual that I have gotten my hands on. It gives examples of what to say to the child and why that skill is important. A lot of times, social skills books will contain great programs that you can implement, but not everyone is proficient enough to actually get them started because the instructions are not very clear. All I have to say is, you need to get this book for yourself if you work with children with special needs!"
5,The Ultiminte Collectors Item,"I got This toy for my 8th birthday. I Like it. Good Toy and good modile . All Toys in this series are NOT waterproof . I'f you want to have a poor shark with no color you can be like that. Otherwise on the bright side this toy is super reastic and a great collecters item. If you don't like sharks, They have a Killer whale about the same size . If you DON'T like whales I don't know what to say. I Think my schleichs whales and sharks are speacial for these reasons: 1. They where made in Germeny .2.They where colored with special paint .(That's why you can't put them in water.) These sea animal toys/Modles go realy well with safri L.D. Sea animals . (Which have a bigger varitey and can be put in water.)"
5,Beautiful Shark,"This is a nice size shark and has a nice weight to it, not too heavy--just feels very solid/durable. I am sure this will be a favorite for a long time. Glad I purchased this for my son!"
3,feels good,"you can never expect too much from creams. . . phyto estrogen or other wise, but this product gives you your money's worth. . . just in the feeling. something extra is in the formula and it just feels good."
5,wonderful feel on skin,"I love that it contains no parabens, smells and feels wonderful, and I seem to be sleeping much better all night long."
2,"Its weak,company is not responsive to bad batch!","I am a user of cremes,and this one brand has changed its formulaor I got bad batch. It was not working properly,and I was inmisery,could not figure out why...stupid me,I bought thetesterone also ( it for sure is crap) but to be fairI don't blame any storefront...I blame the manufacturerwho did not even write back,or request the batch for testingI prefer for those who know the difference,to let customersknow...this new estrogen came today from ...........unsaid companyas soon as i dropped in on my skin...7 hrs later..I FEEL IT.without getting too personal....my ""organs"" made noise ok>USE life-flo product...IT WORKS!!!COMPANY GAVE ME NO REFUND OR NO COUPONS..NO RESPONSE."
1,heavenlymel,This product did not help my perimenopause.....my doctor told me to stop using it has it has not been studied and it wa making me bleed more than normal
5,Hot flashes are gone!,"After dreading hot flashes for months and not wanting to pop any more pills I tried Source naturals Phyto-Estrogen cream. I am not a true believer in anything and was very sceptical. - What a nice surprise - the first week instead of having 15 to 20 flash episodes , I went down to 5 to 7, maybe 2 at night.After 3 weeks I maybe have one to 2 per day in total and they are a lot milder! One tip - apply it on your inner thighs down to your knees instead of neck or arms. I could not handle it on my belly area. It smells slightly like nuts or almonds and might interfere with your perfume."
1,Source Naturals Phyto Estrogen cream,The product estrogen doesn't work. The smell is not great. It doesn't feel great.I don't recommended. It is a waste of money.
4,WANTED IT TO WORK,"This started off well for me, the cream smelled and felt nice and I was hoping for some relief from my PMS symptoms, acne and facial hair. At first my skin felt nice and soft where I applied and I felt it looked as if it had a healthier glow about it. I felt calmer and more relaxed. Anyway after using it for a week I developed the worst spots and acne I have had in years so I stopped the cream, this was about a week ago and the acne is still active,a coincidence or me reacting to the additional hormones maybe someone else could shed some light on this? I will retry the cream to confirm this once this acne clears up (hopefully it will)."
3,oestrogen,Not sure of results yet but am giving it a try. Hope it improves my hormones and skin in time.
3,Ultra 'simple' case,"If you can get this case for a good price, this is a simple but good computer case. As you can see, the front of the case offers a clean design with the case door closes which is a plus in my opinion. The blue color looks black in my apt. There is also a front slot that can be open and close that contains usb and firewire ports. The side vent for the cpu's heat dissipation is useful, although it is not particularly attractive; it also make for a nosier computer. The lower rating is for the fact that the hinge for the case front door is easily broken. It is made of plastic; regular use especially with force will break it. I was able to repair it, but I will open it with care."
2,What!?!?!?!?!?,"Fewest Dropped Calls my A**! In some of the most important places I go in cities, I get dropped calls! I think it has gotten worse since they merged with AT&T. I don't know if any other providers are much better...."
2,terrible in San Francisco,"Happily, my contract is done, and i'm free of AT&T.; I'd always assumed that all providers were the same, so when ATT had a phone my spouse liked, i agreed to switch. I regretted it everyday for 2 years. i live & work in the san francisco bay area, so that's all i can comment on, but here, the coverage is TERRIBLE.lots of dropped calls, terrible reception/ coverage, tons of junk mail (they are still sending me piles of junk, years later), challenging customer service.a 2nd star just for decent prices and convenient plan options, and reliable billing."
1,minutes,"way to much money for what little you get for minutes 450 for 70.00...I have 1,000 mins for 55.00 so do the math. I Would stay with unicel but they just got bought by att&t so i have to find a company by december."
4,Spelling Does Count,"I bought the initial edition of this book in 1975 and at the time was totally perplexed. How could an author write an entire chapter about Count Fleet and misspell the last name of his jockey every time (""Longdon"" instead of ""Longden"")? And how could an editor not catch this error when the chapter contains three copyrighted charts from Daily Racing Form that have the jockey's name spelled correctly. Flash forward three decades to a new edition of this same book and ... Longden's name is still misspelled every time. Didn't anyone in 30 years tell the author or publisher that the name was misspelled??? This belongs in another book -- ""Believe it or Not."""
2,Misleading title,"This DVD was well done, but mistitled. It starts with the three types of grips, and that if you are a serious bowler, you may want to get your own shoes. It doesn't get any more basic than that. There was NO discussion of throwing a strike ball, Lane reading or lane breakdown. No mention of adjustments, ball selection, or proper angle to the pocket. I would only recommend this DVD to very young or new bowlers that have no clue about the game."
5,beyond the bowling basics,I purchased this book b/c I am a left handed bowler like parker bohn the 3rd. it taught me alot i would recommend this book to all left handed bowlers.
5,This book is awesome,"This book has unbelievably information on how to have more energy in your life. I have read the calm energy section so many times to remind myself on how to have more energy. His recommendation on stretching BEFORE getting out of bed has helped me tremendously. I have found with my arthritis that this helps me be able to function better before I even get out of bed. It is chock full of info like this. More people need to try his suggestions to have more energy. This is not a cure all book, it is a book to improve what you do have. None of it is hard to do. The suggestions are simple things you can incorporate into your life. None of them harder than learning to stretch before getting out of bed."
2,High Energy Living,It wasnt bad... good reminder. I think all the descriptors were a bit over the top and the book didnt quiet hit that mark but it was a good skim.
1,"Product is fine, seller doubles its money on shipping charges regardless of # of items shipped","I did receive the bottles, they looked fine. I cannot comment on the efficacy, since I will use them as a gift.I was very surprised to learn that even though I ordered 3, which shipped together in an envelope with USPS First Class service, that I was charged $22.45 for shipping. Shipping could not have costs the seller more than $5. Be warned that the seller doubles the cost of the product through the shipping charges. I complained about this, even would have been happy with half of the shipping costs back, but I was refused. I cannot endorse the seller or his products."
5,Javelina,I received the plush javelina doll very quickly and in perfect condition. Well-made and life-like. Recommend it for anyone looking for this type of toy.
5,"Realistic, Helpful and eye opening.","First off i would like to commend the Author for having the courage and the wisdom to put serious life issues in writing.I cant recall another book that is as realistic and brutally honest that offers step by step support on how to deal and cope.What's interesting about this real life ""tell all"" is that it is just as helpful for the one in need as it is for the person trying to understand what a loved one may be going through. And throughout this woman's journey of overcoming a lifetime of abuse, she always offers HOPE.Something we should never lose sight of! Without Hope there is nothing.I strongly reccommend this book to anyone who is or knows someone dealing with life struggles, addictions, and abuse!!!!Read it twice!"
2,No more pain,It was another book of someones personal journey. I think we could all write one. There was not much in there that would really help someone with BPD. The best part of the book was that it was God who was her helper when she couldn't help herself. I think she should have gotten into that part more than all the gory details of her cutting and lesbianism. Lea
4,Lightweight and convenient,"We took the mugs, one plate, and one bowl with us on a recent 6 day camping trip. We knew they would be light but we we were pleasantly surprised to see that the mugs in particular reliably held liquids. There is a fill line and the mugs will leak a little if overfilled, but otherwise they worked great. For the bowls/plates, we tended to prefer the ones that closed with folds vs. the ones that closed with snaps. The insidious sand on our coastal hike made it hard to keep the snaps clean enough.The items pack easily because they unfold flat but they do begin to assume a bit of a shape over time (especially the mugs) and can be a bit hard to fully flatten out. We also liked that we could bend them to put them in stuff sacks for hanging at night. We did bring an additional small cup for measuring and serving which was quite helpful.We recommend Orikaso for hikers concerned about weight who are looking for a cost-effective alternative to titanium."
4,Shakespeare Coloring Book,Great for the classroom or at home. Children are never too young to appreciate the gifts of these timeless stories.
1,Are you serious?,I cannot believe this movie got so many positive or even average reviews. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I usually love low budget movies with off story lines. But this was just horrible. HORRID acting slow plot and just bad filmaking all together. Please dont waste your money. Im sad that I wasted mine.
2,"Disappointing, Contrived","Perhaps it was sooooo built up as this amazing gut buster, that I viewed it with too high expectations. I was actually bored. I thought the writing was contrived and the acting so over the top that it was hard to find a shred of believability. Also - SHRILL goes a long way. I'm from Texas - I grew up with hicks and these characters were sub-standard imitations. I always miss that magical mix of the absurd with characters that you empathize with in Del Shores writing. One positive note, the slapstick element during the coffin scene helped pick things up a bit."
2,Sordid Lies,"Did audiences really need another gay-is-okay shrill-fest--particularly one that brands fundamentalist Southerners as stupid and silly for their resistance to the movie's message? As humorous as is Leslie Jordan's cross-dresser portrayal, it quickly becomes apparent that most of the fun being poked is aimed at his hillbilliness and not his swishiness. The only character presented as normal is a Texas-born hollywood gay whose acting in nude, homoerotic productions is treated as artistic--while the implication is that the homefolk are low-brow and ill-bred. Yet, half the characters show no sign of sordidness, and some are straight-laced and preachily moralistic. About white trash this movie aint. It's about everyday rural people whose actions and comments are--as in real life--occasionally funny. But the film's theme turns it all into a propaganda piece that is long in the tooth and longer in the telling."
4,LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN!,"This movie really is a hoot! Just like the cover says. A great ensemble piece that whacks the funny bone in the most hurtful, hilarious way. Watch it tonight and watch it tomorrow night and count the things you missed the first time. No less than ten for me. I'm glad I missed it in the theatre 'cause I probably wouldn't have gotten it."
4,Trenche de 'Sordid' Vie,"To say that this film is filled with bizarre people and circumstances would be an understatement, but there are some common Truths, with which we can all relate, that resonate throughout this film. Like many of Del Shores's works, the locale is set in his home state,Texas. He is a talented and prolific writer and director. Those, who write the film off as ""silly"" or ""amateurish"", are missing the point. If for no other reasons, the film is a 'must see' for the costumes, designed by the late Jim Echerd, CDG; and for the performances by many of the actors, who helped create the play from which it was adapted. One of the notable actors, Leslie Jordan, has the opportunity to wear some really wonderful costumes by Echerd, as ""Brother Boy"", one of his signature roles. Those, who enjoy this film, should rent Shores' ""Daddy's Dyin'. Who's Got The Will?"" And, watch for the planned feature, ""Southern Baptist Sissies"". Both are adaptations of successful Shores' plays."
4,What if John Waters Grew Up In Texas?,"Then ""Sordid Lives"" would have been what he came up with. It's really that wonderfully tacky/funny. I was not fortunate enough to see this in a movie theater, but some friends recommended the DVD to me over the summer. While overall an uneven film, the best parts are fall off your chair hysterical (Brother Boy's psychiatric therapy sequences in particular) and Delta Burke is always worth seeing.A lot is being made of the film's gay central character ... That's really not the point of ""Sordid Lives."" Like some freakish time warp to a Texas Trailer Park family reunion sitcom, the best laughs here come because you empathize with the humanity of these people and their absurdities, not because of their ignorance. If this movie had better production values - watch for the boom mike swinging through a few scenes - I'd have given it five stars and it would be stashed right next to my DVD of ""Hairspray."""
3,a laugh a trailor trash,"a rauchy ride through the coming out of a young gay man to his texas trash family, at his grandmothers funeral."
5,Best movie ever madew,"Touching, funny One of the best acted and written movie ever made.You will laugh and cry and think about it for years to come.We have to watch it every few months I am on at least the 35 viewing."
5,Sordid Funny!,"I knew by the title-Sordid Lives, and the trailer on the cover, this had to be a funny movie! We all know someone who resembles the characters in this film from the the in-the-closet son to the neurotic mother of the in-the-closet son. It's side splitting funny and Delta Burke puts in a fantastic performance of the put upon wife! It's a must see film!"
5,The Funniest Film I've Ever Seen !,"Sordid Lives tells the truth about a bunch of white trash southerners,and you will never forget it and maybe die laughing.Dr.Eve is unforgettable ! Brother Boy and Aunt Sissy do just fine in making me laugh also.This film is one you will reccomend to your friends too."
2,NOT like the series.,This is a movie that finishes up the series and I was expecting BETTER.The series is hilarious- would recommend to anyone. Several of the actors are changed in this finale and are not suited to their roles like in the original.Basically not worth watching. Save your money and find out how it all ends by reading the reviews or something.
2,What a drag....,"I expected this movie to be halfway good since it had some familiar celebrities like Beau Bridges, Delta Burke and Olivia Newton-John. However, this movie falls short of its ambition to be a must-have in any gay man's library. The movie starts out somewhat convoluted and you don't know which direction its quite headed. Although there are brilliant acting performances, the plot doesn't seem to capture interest and the dialog misses the target when it is supposed to be funny or moving. The Tammy Wynette impersonator is way over-the-top too. You'd be better off borrowing this DVD from a friend if they happen to have it rather than spending money renting it or buying it."
5,loved it,"i have watched this movie 5 times and just love it....funny funny funny,,,,i highly recommend when you are feeling down,,,plug this in....it will change your attitude...phil"
1,Completely Unwatchable,"About halfway through this movie I was torn:Push the STOP button on the remote.ORHurl a brick into my television set.Since I wasn't in the mood to go out an buy a new television set, I chose to push Stop. This ""movie"" is SO incredibly BAD and UNWATCHABLE that I can't even begin to dissect it. Just do yourself a favor and don't waste even one second of your precious life on this excrementally horrid... thing. If someone gives it to you as a gift, just use the DVD as a drink coaster or pretty frisbee."
1,"Gay porn scenes, fake accents, horrible acting, bad writing.",Easily the worst flick ever made. I had to pull the disc out of the player during the graphic gay orgy scene. Olivia sings the B word and the S word. The acting and writing are so bad as to be bizzare. The best way to put it is this movie is like 400 pounds of poop stuffed into a 5 pound bag. It is really full of it.
5,A Must See!,"This is the kind of film that, once you see it, you want everyone you know to see it! There are characters in this film that we all can relate to. Especially if you are from anywhere in the south. The quote on the cover says it all: ""A Black Comedy About White Trash!"""
3,Amusing,"Calling this movie laugh out load hysterical is a bit of a stretch unless you are starved for entertainment. Think ""Daddy's Dying and Who's Got the Will."" Formulaic; mildly amusing -- there are dozens of other movies out there just like this one."
5,THE NEXT BIG CULT HIT,"This is my new favorite movie. For those who enjoy comedy off the beaten path, this is for you. Rocky Horror move over, there's a new film in town and it's called ""Sordid Lives."""
5,A black comedy about white trash,"Thats the tag line for the movie. This a movie you will want to watch with your friends again and again, with one liners you'll be constantly repeating. Everytime i see a rubber band now, it makes me giggle."
4,SORDID LIVES,IT'S A WONDERFUL FILM AND SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED NATIONALLYNOT JUST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
3,Sordid Lives,"Great fun with goofey, disfunctional characters, but now, this many months away, I don't remember much of it with pleasure."
2,A few laughs but a poor man's Steel Magnolias,"I watched this with friends the other night having heard wonderful things about it. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations but I thought the characters were a bit too over the top and the dialogue was pretty bad. This movie is stock full of wonderful actors who used to have great careers but you would never know it from here. Oliva, who I have always been a fan of seems stranded in a seperate movie until the last scene and the rest of the actors seemed to have been told to chew up scenery at every turn. Sure there's a few amusing bits but by the time it came to the end, I was just plain bored.If you want a funny movie about a bunch of whacky character, rent Steel Magnolias."
5,This thing is amazing,"The first time I watched this, I would have given it maybe three stars, but it's one of those that the more ya watch, the more ya get out of it. Being from the South, I can appreciate the trailer humor down to the last ""bless her heart"" and Bonnie Bedelia wanting to know if he son is ""the man or woman"". Delta Burke is superb and does have some Suzanneque moments. This movie is a great opportunity to see some actors in very different roles.... Olivia Newton-John is very amazing as Bitsy, plus it showcases that still great voice she has. Get this and watch it a few times.... you'll get hooked, bless your heart!"
5,Sordid Lives Movie,"Excellent movie----I still laugh every time I watch it. I would recommend this to anyone. Also, get the series as well, but watch this one first, or you will not understand the series."
3,A Cult Hit,"Maybe it's because I'm from New Jersey, but, this movie feels like there is an inside joke that I am not being let in on. The acting by the entire cast is great, and I can think of MANY worse ways to spend a few hours. I reccommend this for anyone in Palm Springs, Ca. or any gay/gay-friendly people south of the Mason-Dixon Line."
3,Funny great but the series is 5 stars this movie is 3 stars,"I loved the series so I bought the movie,This is so funny but the series is so much better than the movie,watch the series firstThen watch the movie,Thats the way to go so I give the movie 3 stars,And the series is 5 stars,,,Dan"
3,Sordid Lives DVD,Weird. Almost like a Cohen Brothers movie. Very funny in spots but more of a black comedy. Glad I saw it.
2,A Sordid Sendup,"The characters are real ""characters"" but somehow they're hard to care for. That makes it hard to care for the film. However, if you like family skeletons falling out of the sexual closet you may find some campy amusement here. So-so acting, so-so script, so-so result."
5,You must see Sordid Lives,"I saw this movie in Provincetown Mass. at the beginning of this past summer on the recommendation of a friend. Since then I've become a ""Sordid Lives Groupie"". I have seen the movie six times. The first time you see it you miss so many of the best lines so you must go back and see what you've missed. As of October the movie was still playing in Provincetown and has become a cult classic in town. I have seen so many people doing there brother boy impersonations and reciting lines from the movie. I highly recommend this movie, you will not be disappointed"
5,FUNNIEST Movie I have ever seen!!!!,"I've watched it NINE times and still laugh my a__ off every time.It's a Must see....over and over and over....It's just too comical for words, and will let it go at that."
5,Fast and Perfect,I would buy from them again and again. The movie is flawless (and for $2.99) and it came in the mail in three days!
5,I Laughed So Hard,I can't remember when I have seen a funnier movie. The casting is perfect and the one-liners are worth remembering. It's worth seeing again and I want the video when it comes out. Unfortunately it's only playing in Palm Springs.
4,verry good,Sordid Livesmovie was verry funy i laughed all the way through it would recoamend it to anyone that likes a good comidy
5,A MUST FOR ANY CULT CLASSIC COLLECTION !,"JUST AN INCREDIBLE WACKED FILM WITH A CAST OF SEASONED HIGH PROFILED CELEBRITIES . IMPECABLE WRITITNG, DIRECTING ."
4,Great Quality,"Cat5e cable is great, but connector is cheap. Whatever the Belkin 300ft Cat5E is working for me. It's pretty good speed when I done my project, wired is more secure connected and trusted than wireless. Also, I am using Belkin N600 DB router for short range (around 150ft) signal connect for portable gears. Both working perfect !"
5,Hilarious Cookbook!,"Not only did I love the recipes, Mary's Knees, St. Croix Breeze, I loved the humor! This cookbook made me laugh! The author, Alexandra Wentworth, is hysterical! Truly one of the funniest books, let alone cookbooks, I've read! Have fun while cooking and enjoy!"
5,"You will ""Feel It""","This is a great dvd featuring the video from Beenie Man featuring the one and only Janet Jackson, it also includes a making of and great audio mixes of the song, a great addition to any Beenie Man or Janet fan."
5,A Beautiful Score,"If you've had the pleasure of seeing the beautiful film this score is from, which unfortunately was not released in the U.S., then know that the music alone is just as heartbreaking. Regardless of whether you've seen it or not, it is still a score worth buying. The base theme is beautiful as are the interludes. The musical selections by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin are beautifully rendered and fit nicely with the rest of the score."
2,Just listenable,"The soundtrack is mildly pleasant and not especially gratifying. One's attention could easily wander past the generic, sometimes meandering themes and orchestrations of Bacalov's design, not helped by the presence of music by Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin that is more attractive and serves to liven things up with musical nobility. The Orchestra of Rome performs, featuring capable piano solos by the composer. Photos of Isabella Rossellini are a plus, I think."
3,Nothing Special,"Aidan Quinn was horrible. Kelsey Grammer made the movie. If he wasn't in it, I might not have made it to the end. On the upside, the bonus A&E Biography on Arnold was good. Watch it before you watch the movie."
3,COULD'VE BEEN WORSE!,"""Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor"" is a good film. Even though the editing is a bit messy, and I really wasn't 100% convinced of Kelsey Grammar's portrayal of Washington (Jeff Daniels was better in ""The Crossing""), it had some good battle scenes and decent storytelling. I also wasn't 100% happy with Aidan Quinn as Arnold. But it is worth a look or two! Grade: B-"
1,Woof,What a dog of a movie. Bad acting compounded by overacting built upon atrocious casting. Burn before watching.
1,A&E needs to wake up!,"Again, an eagerly anticipated evening's enjoyment watching an excellent movie about an important part of America's history, is thwarted because of no sub-titles. The product details mention ""closed-captioned"", but I need sub-titles. A&E has lost another sale. I bet I'm not the only person who needs subtitles!"
3,misses a major benefit,"I've only been using this for a short time. One great feature of good language learning products is the ability to compare your pronunciation with that of native speakers. Since intonation is critical when speaking Chinese, I expected this would be of tremedous help learning Chinese. However, I happen to have a deep male voice, and the only voice they provide for comparison is a woman with a high voice. As a result, I cannot match that voice print. They mention this issue in the fine print. I think having only one native speaker to compare to is a problem with this software; they should provide multiple native speakers so you can pick the one closest to your own natural voice for comparison. I very much like the approach except for this."
1,Rosetta Stone V2 China,I immediately downloaded the Rosetta Stone V2 China and found that the earphones that were in the package did not work. I have not been able to utilize the product.
1,Not Clear at All!,"I guess you get what you pay for. I had a more expensive screen protector before, but it finally got wrinkled and messed up after 10 months of use. I just put the BoxWave Clear Touch protector on this morning. Dust, dirt and hair sticks to the surface. After only a few hours of use the screen is a mess. It still has bubbles and the edges never did stick down. The surface has a lot of drag which takes away from how cool the S-Pen is on the Note. I had high hopes for this screen protector but it turned out to be a lesson learned. I am ordering the more expensive different brand tonight."
4,Intellectual viaticum,"This series of lectures are simply interesting and entertaining. Not only is Campbell a great writer, but he is also a witty lecturer. His breakdown of Joyce's distinction of art vs. pornography is especially entertaining.Beyond the lectures themselves, I am a bit shocked that the sellers are offering this product for hundreds of dollars. I suppose the marketplace controls price, but unless this is some kind of collector's item it is certainly not worth more than twenty dollars. I bought it on clearance at Barnes and Noble for about four dollars. If you want to experience Campbell's lecture try to check it out of your local library."
3,Ok,"Ok book but overly simplistic. Maybe a little naive. My personal experience as a MAT Commanded in the delta in 1969 was that the ARVN units/officers I observed were not as competent and professional as this book makes them out to be. Also, many of the operations I participated in were not so flawlessly executed as these in the book described."
1,"GREAT CD, except a song is missing that was on the LP, but not on the CD",I was disappointed that Jump Shout Boogie didn't survive the migration process from LP to CD. One thing that I despise with a passion is when the record labels got cheap and omitted the artwork and songs that appeared on the LP copies of albums and just left us with cheap imitations. The record labels should still do better!!! I give this ONE star to reflect the lack of thought and effort of the record labels to stiff us fans with selling us watered down CD's.
5,"Very Readable,","The story is nearly epic in it's scope and yet its not a really long book. I enjoyed reading from the first page to the last and it was also fun as an EverQuest player to see the encounters taking place in familiar territory. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good magic and intrigue adventure story. Even if you don't have a clue about EverQuest you will still find it enjoyable. If you ever did play EverQuest and especially if you tried the enchanter class this is a must read. It is well written, has a good pace and leaves you wanting more when you are done."
3,Another EQ novel falls short.,"This book came out in October 2005. It's now the end of February 2006, and I'm going to be the first person to write a review? That's pretty sad, but I guess so many readers were burned by the previous lackluster attempt at an EQ novel that no one bothered with this one.I was an avid Everquest player for 5 years, and the Ocean of Tears was one of my favorite areas...plus I've been reading fantasy since I was a small child. As I browsed through the bookstore the other day, I noticed this on the shelf and figured I'd pick it up and see. I'll keep this short and sweet...don't waste your time. If you want a real EQ experience, play the game. If you want real fantasy, dust off the Tolkien or Goodkind or Eddings."
2,nothing new,I have come to realize the selections for instant video that do not have the release year are not the best. The description makes note of using 3D imaging and that's the reason I decided to watch. The 3D was so basic any 7 year old could probably get the same results. The video and sound quality are straight from the 80's and the information presented has been done to death and far better. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
4,Kinght coching,Season on the Brink is a great movie about Bobby Knight because they dont try and sugar coat who he was they show is ture colors witch are not always plesent . James Lafftery who protrays Steve Alfred who was one of coach knights best player . You may also know James Lafftery for is role as Nathan Scott on One Tree hill.If you like sports movies you should check it out .
4,Pretty good for the money!,"I have owned this item for about a month and been using it almost daily. I am a pretty big guy so I'm a bit concerned with the construction holding up over time but so far it has delivered, especially for the price. My only real concern is the seat and rail system it glides on. That feels a little cheap but so far it has performed fairly well. The resistance is smooth and I think it's a worthy piece of equipment for anyone not wanting to spend a lot of cash."
3,Overall a good buy.,Overall the quality is appropriate for the price. I decided I'd rather buy this rower then one of the more expensive rowers to see if I would stick with it. My biggest issue is that the resistance is not easily adjusted. I was expecting to be able to adjust it on the fly like some of the rowers I had used at the gym were able to do. With this rower you have to disconnect the resistance cable and loop a strap either less or more to your liking. Not the easiest thing to do.
3,Not long enough chain,"I purchased this row machine for my husband, and I never used it myself. He used it approx 10 times and then stopped. I asked him why he doesn't use the machine any more, and he complained that there is not enough length in the chain for him to get a full row (he is 6' tall). We have hardwoods floors (which aren't perfectly level), and as he rows the entire machine slides across the floor."
4,Excellent value,"At this price point there really is no comparison to other rowing machines. at 6'2"" and 235 lbs, this piece of equipment feels solid and like it will last for quite a while. The fans aren't adjustable and the rollers for the seat are not quite as smooth and the $1,000-$1,500 machines are, but since I could buy 5-8 of these machines for the same price, this is not an unreasonable trade off.Assembly instructions were complete and it was pretty easy to assemble. One bolt pre-assembled was slightly off kilter (it was a bolt threaded on both sides and it wasn't centered properly) but not enough to cause any failure other than a small asthetic one.The onboard computer seems very generous regarding the amount of calories burned.so far I'm very pleased with this purchase and am starting to put in solid work outs every other day."
4,Rowing,I had used a commercial rower previously and bought this one for home use. I am well pleased with it. It is more substantial and solid than I had anticipated. About my only complaint is that the meter does not seem to work very accurately. It records burning far more calories than I believe I do (based on the rower at the local gym). If however you row by length of time you would have no issue with the equipment at all. It is easy to assemble.
1,Serious assembly issues,"Maybe this is indicative of my mechanical aptitude, but I've found this rower very difficult to put together. Specifically, attaching the chain.The instructions are useless on this. Very frustrating. So I now have a almost, but not quite assembled rowing machine sitting on my floor doing me no good whatsoever. Just a word to the wise."
3,"A good machine for the price, a few minor flaws.","Just got this in Dec. assembly wasn't difficult although instructions were less than clear. Very light weight (slides all over a hardwood floor without tethering or non-slip pad). Works good with a nice smooth motion. There is no tension adjustment, just the fan resistance and the digital readout is rudimentary at best. With rowing machines you really do get what you pay for and this machine is the best one I have run across under $300. Folds up (which is a bit more complicated than it could be) for storage. It is a bit louder than some others but not really loud, just the fan noise with each pull. Great exercise, despite slightly light resistance for me I can get a decent cardio workout in less than an hour with the machine."
2,Machine worked great for a while...,"...but a part broke and I went to order a replacement part <which you can only get from the company directly> and it has been over three months. All they say is ""sorry, it will ship some day"". That is a big help. Worst customer service for a company I have ever dealt with. Great machine unless you need to deal with the company.Hope this helps."
2,Not what I expected,This is not the fault of Amazon or even the product. I wasused to a gym quality rower (conceptII) which allows a lot of resistance. The Integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance. I am in the process of sending it back. The machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge. An expensive lesson.
1,Junk!! Don't Buy any Gateways,"Horrible customer service. my buddy bought this laptop at bestbuy for $1000. thing broke 3 times during first year. now its broke again 4th time same part mother board and they won't do anything. 2 months out of year warrenty. gateway sucks. buy a sony or toshiba instead!!!!! buy the way im a certified network techinicain (college degree, mcsa 2003, a+, ccna, cna 5.1, dsce certifications) i know what im talking about."
5,Video of the wonderful Tokyo '96 CD,I saw this listed on AMG and wanted it but couldn't find it here under Keith Jarrett. Eventually I discovered it under Jarrett/Peacock/De Johnette. Hooray! If you know and love the Tokyo '96 CD then you know what to expect as this is that very concert from March 30 plus about 20 mins that didn't fit on the CD.The full track listing is: It Could Happen Yo You; Never Let Me Go; Billie's Bounce; Summer Night; I'll Remember April; Mona Lisa; Autumn Leaves; Last Night When We Were Young / Caribbean Sky; John's Abbey; My Funny Valentine / Song (all on the CD) plus All The Things You Are; Tonk.Typically excellent Japanese production to match the trio's typically excellent performance. It's a winner.
5,The trio in peak form.,"One can argue over which is the best Jarrett-Peacock--DeJohnette recording, but no one can argue that Tokyo 1996 isn't one of the very best. ""Never Let Me Go"" and ""John's Abbey"" transport the listener (and viewer in the case of the video format) from ballad to bebop heaven respectively. And the 10 other tracks are of like quality. This concert as a whole was a masterpiece of both trio interaction and individual creation."
3,Smile,I don't see much of a difference when I use this product. I'll keep trying to see if it brightens my teeth.
5,Great to have/Great to give,"There aren't enough good things to say about this book. The premise is that in losing the 'hearth' in a home, the whole family and whole culture suffers. Cooking is a sacred act and it nourishes so very much more than nutritional needs in a family. This is a global truth as the writer explores in chapters about Buddhists, ancient Goddesses, and modern families."
2,Disapointing at best.,"What starts out as fresh and witty soon becomes tedious. There is no doubt that McEwan posses a wicked sense of humor. However instead of capitalizing on it the reader is ""treated"" to the same joke over and over and over.Is it funny? Yes. Is it worth reading? Probably not. Which is unfortunate cause the book has a tremendous amount of promise."
5,Live In Switzerland/Abe Laboriel and Friends,"Great funk/jazz. He's got an appreciative audience, justifiably so, in Switzerland. That's where I got turned onto him, thru a funk/jazz student/artist-friend, Lorenz."
5,My Daughter Loves This Video,My daughter is a 14 year old with a mental disability and she loves this video. She enjoys most shows with music.
4,Art History's History,"This is a great little summary of the discipline of Art History. It's a concise & well-written overview of the place of Art in Western History and Academia, from Ancient Greece to 20th Century America. You'll find it to be an easy but very informative read. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in Western Art, Philosophy, and/or History."
3,ROBERT MUNSCH GREAT STORY'S,The book of Aaron's Hair is one of the funny book's I read. My favorite part was when her hair went down the street and got on top of the statue. I liked that part it looked almost like a real person or as a ghost. My favorite character was Aaron because she looks silly without hair. The funniest part was when the hair was on the lady's stomach and she said that it was growing. I think that the illustrations pictures were great.
4,GOOD JOB ROBERT MUNSCH!!!!,I think Aarons Hair was a great book. I think it was a great book because it had funny things. My favorite part was when Aaron got bald and his hair ran away. The funniest part was when the hair was growing on the man's bottom. My favorite character was Aaron because he was bald and funny. I think that the pictures were great because on each page everybody say's Hair I hate you. The book didn't remind me about anything. I recommend this book to everybody.
5,It was a fantasic book,"Aaron's Hair was a good book for fourth graders and teachers. My favorite part is when Aaron said, ""Hair, I Hate you?"" And my favorite character was Aaron. The funniest part was when the hair jumped off of Aaron's head. The illustrator drew very good pictures. I recommend to read this book to my mom."
5,Aaons's hair is the best book I ever read,"Aaron's Hair was the best book I ever read because it was funny and hysterical. My favorite part of the story is when the boy said ""I hate you hair"" that's my favorite part of the story. My favorite character is the mom because she said ""! Aaron I found your hair.!"""
4,you rock!,"The thing that was perfect for me because I love when he screams he book was. The thing that is funny is when Aaron's hair runs away. My favorite character is Aaron because he's bald. My illustrations is when the man said, the hairs is growing from my behind. It did make me think about it. I recommend Robert Munch to read this book."
3,Aaron'sHair was boring,"The book Aaron's hair was boring because it was not that fun or hilarious. Also, the part that I didn't like was when Aaron says, ""Hair I hate you."" because when little kids start reading this book they will start saying this word and they are going to start getting themselves in trouble. Also the funny part is when Aaron turns bald. My favorite charter is Aaron. Alan & Lea Daniel are good at drawing and I like their pictures. This book reminds me of when my cousin cut his hair bald."
3,Aaron's Hair was little boring,"Aaron's Hair is kind of boring. One example, it keeps on saying I Hate You! It is kind of annoying. My favorite character is the hair because he knows how to hide. The pictures are kind of funny. The book reminds me of me when my hair is long. I think it would be for people that like funny books. I don't think it is for children under 6 because your children might learn the words ""I hate you"". This is my opinion."
5,Aaron's Hair,The first time I saw this book was when it was told in sign language to a group of deaf children. The narrator was so demonstrative the whole room was in stitches. Then the children acted out the story in sign and it was hilarious. It has become the favorite book of both my 2-year-old and 8-year-old grandchildren. The story of Aaron and his hair is so funny. I have not read a better child's book in my 40 years of reading them...and I have read many.
3,Aaron's Hair,"I have enjoyed several Robert Munsch stories and enjoy them all very much. I love to read them with the children that I care for as well as my own Son. As many of you are aware when reading these stories there is always a key line that the children can remember and share while reading aloud. I was dissapointed however, that the strong line in this story was ""Hair! I hate you!"" I thought that this is a very negative and strong word to teach young children."
2,Aaron's Hair was not a good book.,"The book Aaron's Hair was not a good book, because Aaron's hair cannot jump off Aaron's head. What I didn't like from the book was the last part because Aaron's family grew beards. There was only one good part that I liked. It was when Aaron's mom told him why he was bald. The only character I like is Aaron because he was a little bit funny. I think the illustrations were nice. This book kind of makes me think of my hair too."
4,The nieces like it more than I do.,"Robert Munsch, for the uninitiated, writes a number of cheerfully absurd books. This one is about a boy who hates his hair, and finds that saying that hurts his hair's feelings so much that it runs away. Sentient hair!Frankly, I find Aaron running around telling people to tell his hair that they hate it so it'll stop growing on them to be a bit tasteless, but my nieces *adore* this book and ask for it often, so I can overlook that part.If you're concerned about use of the phrase ""I hate you"" you may wish to read this book before you buy it."
3,"Man, How I Wanted to Love This","In the back of my mind, for DECADES, I have wondered why ""When Things Were Rotten"" was cancelled so quickly. As a kid, after all, I loved it. After buying this tape, though, I now know. Despite the wonderful site gags, the off-topic lines by characters directly to camera, the much-beloved comic geniuses who guest-starred, and despite the fact that it came from my hero Mel Brooks -- it's just a lot more stupid than funny. Even the theme song isn't as funny as I remembered it. And the sets look like a high school play. Oy!So should you buy this? If you love Mel Brooks as I do, then yes you should. After all, there are a ton of funny gags and lines that even Richard Gautier's really poor delivery can't kill. The potential was here, but didn't really come to fruition until ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" many years later.A disappointment? Yes. But some pain can only be exorcised by putting yourself through it."
3,Fine -- does what it needs to,"Solid lock, at a fair price. I think, in retrospect, I should have just bought one at the local hardware store, though. Same price, less shipping materials used, and same product."
1,Depression CAN be a choice - should be the title,"You have depression caused by circumstances and you have depression caused by chemical unbalance. You can treat yourself out of the depression if only you are sure that it is not a chemical unbalance. If you find that your depression is certainly caused by something that happened to you (loss of a loved one, etc.)you can make a choice where you can be depressed for the rest of your life or choose to accept what cannot be undone and move on. This book should be read with open mind but should not be taken as an absolute solution to this problem. However, one thing is true, mind is a mood controller... how you feel depends on your mind's perception of things."
5,I Love the Positive Concept,"I love the positive concept, ""Depression is a Choice.""It's so uplifting!Us women should all say that together to clear the air."
2,It's that simple,"Basically Curtiss's thesis is this: Depression IS a weakness and a character flaw, caused by self-pity and unproductive living. She doesn't seem to understand that not all depressions are the same. She fails to understand how high-achieving, productive people still get depressed, or that some diseases are biochemical (like manic depression) and that unhappiness can't always be cured by happy thoughts and yelling ""Green Frog!"" If you weren't depressed before you read this book, you may be soon afterward."
2,"Not a Prescription for Everyone, Especially Suicidal Persons","I read this book hoping to find a solution to a long and nearly fatal battle with manic-depression. I came away from the book feeling a little inspired but mostly empty. Ms. Curtiss has some good insights but the whole idea of abandoning all drugs in an effort to rid oneself of depression might be dangerous for some. It was for me personally! I went off of my prescription, thinking I could win the war with depression without the aid of drugs. Within days I fell into a deep and desperate (suicidal) depression that refused to budge. I went ahead and got back on the medicine and have not felt that low ever since! Medicine is unquestionably not for everyone, but it is for many."
5,Finally someone says it,"For me, it was a great relief to be told to take responsibility for managing my moods and to be given some very specific suggestions about how to do it. The author states her case very strongly, but it didn't really bother me - and I found the repetition, the examples from her life, and the references to literature, etc. to be actually rather helpful in etching new thoughts into my brain. I have always felt - in my own case, at least, that drugs were not the anwer and that in some way I simply was not taking enough responsibility for my self. But I needed some help in figuring out how to proceed. Therapists - who push drugs or the repetition of painful stories from childhood - have not helped me. This book has and I recommend it. I am saddened by those people who are so scared of challenging idea that they have given it a negative review on the basis of the title alone - and have lacked the courage to read the book and see what it actually says."
5,A powerful learning tool for living the life I want,"I first read this book thinking I could pass the ideas along to help others who grapple with depression and bipolar behavior. What I learned was Curtiss's methods of managing the mind are useful for everyone. By using directive thinking, I disrupt my poor behavior impulses and replace them with better choices, such as in the area of food management and also helps in eliminating fears that hold me back. Curtiss's method is simple and sensible. Success lies in the practice. This book is an excellent self-empowering tool and deserves to be read by anyone interested in understanding how to use the mind to lead a more satisfying life."
3,Bought used - thought it was new,"I bought this thinking it was new and while the action figures were in perfect condition, the packaging was not. The cardboard backing was in pretty good condition but the clear plastic was yellowed as if it had aged in the sun. Recommend the action figure but only if you can get a guarantee that it's new if you're looking to collect it."
2,"Romance, nto up to par","Though the take on the story is original, I wasn't that impressed with it. The plot itself has a nice twist on teh amnesia trick but the twist of timetraveling really didn't live up to its' premise for me. A good, lazy, easy read that shoudl be purchsed used and new."
5,I really enjoyed it-couldn't put it down.,"There are two main reasons why I picked up this book to read. One being that I enjoy thrillers. The other being, it's set in my home state.This is my first Steve Thayer novel and I'll be sure to pick up his others.From the beginning I figured out who it was. Which was a disappointment in a sense but as I read the book, Thayer made me second guess my opinion. Which is what, indeed, made it an excellent book.I was getting worried and frustrated towards the end, as I felt that the killer wasn't going to be identified. But at least, he was in a creative ending.Overall I felt that I got to know the characters as well as the setting. The ropes of newscasting & the weather-Thayer researched a long time about the roles to be informed of what he was writing about. Which gives him 5 out of 5 stars!"
5,I really enjoyed this one,Fast paced and interesting. I like novels where I feel liked I've learned something as well as been told a good story. Thayer seems to know his weather and news. I passed my copy along to my my dad and brother and they enjoyed it as well.
2,"A Decent Read, Nothing Special","I found Thayer's accounts of the Minnesota weather, and the workings of a television newsroom, to be engrossing and enjoyable. However, other than the protagonist, Rick Beanblossom, none of the characters are very deeply drawn. I did not find the book to be very suspenseful; it bogs down in the middle to the point that you begin to lose interest, and the author never really gives you an alternative to the obvious villain.Having said all that, if you have a few hours to kill on a plane, this is a decent story and the writing is a cut above the usual mass market thriller."
3,A dual purpose for this book,"By the end of the story I was still unsure who committed the crime. The author tantalizingly hinted that Andy Mack or another serial killer in another state did the crimes Dixon Bell were convicted of. There were sub-stories of the other characters that cluttered the novel: Per Ellefson, Jack Napoleon and Old Jesse. IN the end, I learned the author worked at a newsroom for three years so it was probably his desire to invlude what could probably be the colorful lives of some of the people he met. Altogether a good read because of the author's incredible knowledge about TV newsrooms and weather forecasting, after only three years of on-the-spot experience. The love story of Rick Beanblossom was particularly poignant and is, to me, the sentimental touch in this mystery."
3,A decent read with plenty of twists,"It kept me guessing right up to the end. I enjoyed the characters, flaws and all. The story moved along at a nice pace."
3,Not really worth it...,"Ok, It starts off pretty interesting... but it gets really slow and very predictable. The ending just leaves you hanging"
3,"Good, Fast-Paced Writing, But Ultimately A Total Let Down","This is the only book I've read by Steve Thayer. I loved the writing-- it is wonderfully descriptive, yet concise and to the point. There are genuine spooky moments in the book, but they don't string together to form a compelling mystery/ thriller. It is more of a character study, and a very good one. He throws in too many red herrings that are exciting and yet disapointing because in the end there is no mystery twist-- it ends just as you would expect. It's a really weird book --it is wonderful at examining and juggling a handful of characters and because of that I'd give it five stars if it had not been marketed as a thriller. I liked the writing so much that I plan on seeking other titles by Thayer."
2,Was not quit worth my time,"This book was so,so but it does have some suspense in some places. If you want to read a good mystery with suspense, romance, mystery, and evrything you could possibly want that will keep you on the edge of your seat, I suggest reading Bloodline by Jill Jones."
5,Excellent writing,I loved this author's writing style! So many books with great ideas are written without much style - or with so much that it's tedious. The story was good but the writing was excellent and I'll be looking for more of his books.
1,"""Duh""","If Stephen King reviewed this..catastrophe...it had to be after his accident.As a writer, and teacher, the last thing I would do is to repeat a ""main character's"" name.To be honest, I made it through 140 pages. That was 100 pages too many (but I did need reading material while on the john).At this point, I wouldn't care if my mother was the murderer.Go back to school, Thayer.Ratings? You didn't offer less than ""one"". ""one star"" was a gift."
1,Hated It!,As soon as I finished this book I through it accross the room in disgust! It was terrible!
3,"Less random nonsense, more biographical info please","...High on padding, low on truly insightful detail, this is a sad attempt at a biography by a man who seems to have only grasped the superficial aspects of the Harry Potter books anyway.I look forward to the autobiography that I'm sure Joanne Rowling will be encouraged to write sometime in 2006 when the whole series is finally out. I do not recommend this book as being a particularly good substitute, but it's the best we'll get till then, I suppose."
2,Blech,"Definitely skip this one by Foster. The plots were stupid, the dialogue was lame and corny, there was no emotional depth, and the women were flat-out stupid. Foster has written much better."
4,Wonderful reprint of two older stories,This book lived up to all of my expectations! I particularly liked Scadalized as the story builds upon a pre-existing relationship. I thought both female characters were great and found myself laughing with Shadow often in Sex Appeal. The male characters were smart and sexy and definately left me wanting more.
5,Great Product,This stuff works. Made my tight lock work better than it did when it was new. I will always keep a can around to keep everything working smooth.
1,Product Received without nozzle and therefore is not useable,"This product was ordered and promptly delivered to my wifes paents that live in Georgia. They then visited my family in Mozambique, Africa over the Christmas holidays and brought the product to me. I just went to use it and uon removing the cap the nozzle is missing. I cannot use the product. Unless I can get a replacement this was a waste of my money."
3,works but i've had better,"i've used a different brand of graphite lube spray that had a much higher ratio of graphite to evaporating solvent than ags le5 lock ease has. so it works, but not as well as it should will buy alternate brand next time"
5,EASE OPEN YOUR DOORS AND LOCKS,"This product was recommended to me by the locksmith and it is terrific. My door locks all over the house, car and my horse trailer work with ease and not gummed up by other products that many use thinking that they are for locks. This product was made especially for locks and will keep them working effortlessly for years with no problems."
5,Awesome! You get to hear Dick's voice which is exciting.,"More great video from/about Dick. It's true, theres a lot more wildlife and nature footage than One Man's Wilderness, but the cabin's already been built so what else is there to show?! One of the best parts to me is getting to hear Dick's voice doing some of the narration, he's got a very unique and interesting cadence that I get a kick out of. If you watch close he also shows you how he prepares his sourdough biscuits."
3,Different Take,"i enjoyed watching this film as a follow up to ""One Man's Wilderness"", which I viewed on PBS. This documentary contains the actual narrative of Dick Proenneke, something that gives the film a unique feel. There are also more shots of the wildlife that occupied the area, and Dick's perceptions on these critters is interesting for the viewer. I did miss the more in-depth look at how the cabin and tools were made that ""One Man's Wilderness"" provided, and think I will have to add that DVD to the collection as well. Both ""The Frozen North"" and ""One Man's Wilderness"" are worth having in any collection as a look into the human spirit."
4,adventure,A look into how hard the life in the wilderness is and why only a few live to tell about it.
5,An Excellent Read,"While waiting for an airplane I happened open this book. It was a great read! Two thirds of the way through I was still waiting for the hero to appear, but couldn't put it down! This book will draw you in and also make you realize how bad drug addiction can be. This author must have done his or her share of drugs.Nonetheless, if you want to get lost in a great story that you can't put down, read this book."
4,Good But Program Menu on The Getaway is only Japanese,I wish I could show the Program Menu on The Getaway in just Japaneese. I tried everything to bring up the English. I could not do it.The other two movies are fine and the movie The Getaway self is just great.
3,"5 Stars for the songs, 1 Star for the sound quality.","This is an amazing album, the songs are great. The HUGE problem with it is the mastering. The sound quality is awful. Lisener fatigue sets in with me after a few songs. It is way too bright and phases all over the place. I am sure that all of the Max Webster Anthem CD's suffer from the same problem (although) I have only heard this one. It is too bad because this is a great collection of songs and includes one from his 1st EP (which I would love to have on CD). Anyways, if you have orginal albums, hook up your CD player and record it yourselves. If you work at Anthem or whoever owns these songs, please redo this collection in a listeanable version.In Toronto with the Tonto's and Here among the Cats.."
2,Best of Max Webster,Basically has two OK songs on it. One has Getty Lee on vocals. Not at all what I expected after I heard one of the two Ok songs on Sirius XM.
4,Great thought provoking material,"I love David Toop and any work he's involved in. From music to academic writing, this guy knows his stuff. He's very well versed in music and has done his research thoroughly you can tell.. He has a unique way of explaining sound and its magic, definitely grab any books he's written on the subject of sound."
4,Liked it a lot,"If you like ambient, or....atmospheric music of any sort you should give this book a chance as it a nice erudite survey of the various genres and musicians that are linked to..or been influenced by ambient music. It is not a linear survey thru time, but rather this book reminds me of a map which Toop rolls around visiting here and there with a few jumps now and then as he discusses how in the last 100 years ""music has reflected the world back to itself and to its listeners"". The writing is enjoyable, and full of poetry, such that I kept finding myself underlining odd bits and pieces every few pages and I wound up compiling them for myself for future reference. There is also a nice bibliography and discography at the end of the book."
4,Good...so far....but stolen!,"Briefly, I read two chapters...took the book into a MacDonalds...and read while waiting to order my take-out! Put the book down while getting catup and walk-out without the book! Drove 35 miles and was so determined to get the book bac that I drove the 35 miles or so back! When I arrived at MacDonalds...the book was gone...no one saw it! So, someone is enjoying the books or so I hope so...and my notes ought to help them, too. And what will I do? I will purchase the book again!Why? Because what I read sounded like good advice."
2,Weak,"I was actually looking for something to record a ring tone, this item really doesn't sound anything like a realy cricket...maybe a kid might think so...I actually found some good sounds on the internet - NOT those ring tone sites either, more like nature sites."
3,Great Sound Does Not Cut It!,"As a severe storm lover, I eagerly awaited this DVD. The opening sceen starts out wonderful with beautiful DTS sound. Then it quickly goes down hill from there. It interviews a few ""Hurricance Experts"" and chasers, shows video of them flying through the eyewall of Hurricane Emily. From there, well it really does not show much more on Hurricanes. Then Tornadoes are discussed. Video of only one tornado and the chase! I was disappointed! I was expecting lightning, towering thunderstorms and a few more tornado videos. If you want an excellent storm video, get National Geographic's ""Natures Fury"". It is superb compared to this. More footage and great sound."
2,"Lame footage, great sound","I expected to see some spectaular footage of storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, especially considering the creditionals of the director. Instead we are shown some pretty lame footage and some barely interesting descriptions of the methods and equipment the stormchasers use. Sound was pretty good with the right setup, but at 38mins you do want to be ""blown away"" by the content. This just does not deliver. Check out ""Everest"" if you want to buy an IMAX DVD."
2,"Great sound, good video, little content!","I'm not sure if it was the huge screen, or what, but when I saw this feature in Omnimax it was much more impressive! The video is good, the sound is awesome on a surround sound system, but there is little storm footage. If I wanted to watch the people who chase storms, I could turn on TLC or the Discovery channel.Spend your money on Twister if you're looking for a storm flick! Sure the tornados are Hollywood-made but at least you get to see them for more than 60 seconds!! This DVD ...! I want my money back!"
2,So-So,I was disappointed by the lack of drama. It was like watching a boring version of the eleven o'clock news.
1,IMAX Stormchasers,I was very disappointed with this video. There was little actual storm footage. Mostly about the weather equipment.
3,"Very nice appearance for a while, but be careful.","The manufacturer claims that the planter has ""effective drainage,"" but not really. Yes, it does have a bottom water tray, but I will tell you that you must place a significant amount of crushed rock in the bottom before you fill it with planting soil. I didn't, and the soil must have clogged the bottom weep holes. The planter filled entirely with rain water, which I noticed only when the plants started to die from root rot. I had to drill one inch holes above the water tray to drain the water and salvage some of my plants. Now, the planter no longer has that nice appearance. This Fall, I will empty the soil and use the bottom rock layer trick. Unfortunately, the holes will have to remain. Too bad that Dynamic Design didn't warn of this potential problem in their ad."
2,Its OK!!,"The other customer reviews sounds satisfactory. The pot is a small plastic worth couple dollars. I am new to gardening, and I have a baby plant. This pot is okay for short run."
4,great pots - lots of sizes,"I first bought these pots at our local garden center, then on Amazon to try to get better price. They look great, they're sturdy. Love that the saucer is attached to the pot - makes it easier to move the pots around. Also like that they come in lots of sizes so that all my pots match (I have a container garden on my patio). Only negative is the pots don't have good drainage. Just have 3 holes or so and the plastic isn't cut all the way through, so you need to poke them out yourself. To make sure my pots drain well, I remove the saucer and drill additional holes in the pots before using them. Price on Amazon is slightly cheaper than at our garden center for 12"" and 16"", slightly more expensive for 10""."
4,Great Starter Guitar,"Perfect for my nine year old, who is just learning how to play. Looks cool and comes with everything you need."
3,It's allright.,"I like the footprint/handprint part it comes with, but everything else seemed kind of ""stuffed"" in the book.All the other babybooks I've seen had organization to them but this one had the holidays jumbled up, the growth chart way towards the back after ther 1-5 birthdays, etc..The fact I still, after 14.5 months, have to flip through the pages to find what I'm looking for is quite annoying, but all in all it's a satisfactory babybook. Not something I'd buy again though."
4,Beautiful baby book for first moments.,"I recommend purchasing this book to capture the firsts (coming home from hospital, first holidays, etc), and then another book for just holding photos. This book is great, very easy to re-arrange the pages and use the photo corners. The only thing is that you can really only fit a few photos per page if you are using 4X6 standard prints. So you can document the event and write the details on the page to the right and then include a few sample pictures on the page on the left. The page on the right also does a great job of listing out what moments you should write about, and how. I'm sure you can purchase additional pages to hold more photos, but there really is not enough room to add them to the spine once the existing pages have pictures on them.That said, I do love this book and am happy I bought it. Writing this review as I search for another, more basic photo album just to place more photos in."
5,Amazing idea,"If you don't like the same old baby book, this one is for you. The quality is good, the pages are informative and fun to fill out. This is a must have baby book."
2,Disapppointed,I ordered 2 because I have twins. The books are very nice looking and there are plenty of pages. I had one big problem the entire contents of both books pulled out of the spine before I got passed writing on the first three pages. Very disappointed in the construction.
5,baby book,"Item was recd. in record time, and was just as described in details I couldn't be happier. It was a gift and the recepients were thrilled with the product also."
2,"Pretty, but easily damaged","The book was pretty and the page inserts looked like a helpful guideline for what to include. However, the cover is made of thin fabric and paper and it really doesn't look like it will hold up over time. The book I received had two smudges on it already, so I returned it and will look for something similar, but more durable."
3,"Cute, but pages bent.","The book is okay. I haven't used the ink pad yet and I haven't started to put photos in. What bothers me is that the bottom right corner of the book cover is bent and all of the pages are bent at the corners. Not impressive. I would return it, but I don't want to go through the hassle."
1,Decent if uninspired content but horrendous quality,"I read many reviews on the product and assumed the comments on quality were overblown or stated by an unlucky few. Turns out the quality of this baby book is far worse than I could have imagined. When I received this and opened it up, I found the inner binding (where pages attach to cover) was tearing. I want a memory book that lasts. Unfortunately, this is incredibly fragile. Content-wise, I haven't seen many other baby books, so I can't compare, but my sense is that this book is pretty basic. It just lists a bunch of ""firsts"" and gives you space to put in a picture and fill in when the event happened. It gets the job done but is nothing special. Disappointing. I'm not looking forward to sifting through Amazon and other websites for reviews to find a better product ..."
3,OK.,"This book has the things you'd want in it. It is however, very simple. There are really just words and lines on each page. If you want to go minimal and as simple as you can, this book is for you. I was looking for something with a little more character. The footprint idea is a great one but the book itself is not overwhelming."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this in blue and pink for my boy/girl twins and I'm very disappointed. The hand print/footprint kits are okay, though I wish it came with more cards for mistakes since it took us many tries to get a good print for either baby. I like that there's a place for a picture and hand print/footprint on the cover. I don't like how the pages don't lay down nicely and you have to bed the page to get it to lay flat. This is especially a problem since the places for pictures are on the back sides of the pages and if you're using photo corners to add a picture, you really need the page to lay flat. I also wish there were more prompts for things like baby's first ______.I'm going to get rid of these and use Hallmark's baby book instead. It has more prompts, it's has three ring binding so the pages lay flat, and there are places for pictures on both sides of the pages. This book, unfortunately, made for an expensive hand print/footprint kit since it's going in the trash!"
5,LOVE IT!,I just received this book today... After reading everyones reviews .. I new I was gonna LOVE IT! Its exactly like a couple ppl describe.. Absolutely WORTH THE MONEY!!
4,Confirming the first review.,"The chairs are yellow, not really beige. The color fortunately worked in my décor, but may not for others. The assembly was not difficult. I have had the chairs for six months without any issues with regular use."
2,Not well made,"I knew from other reviews that these chairs are yellower than the picture indicates. What I didn't know is the fabric is much shinier, making them clash with my other furniture and just look cheap. They are also not well made, and the pre-drilled holes don't match up well. We had to make adjustments to them to get some of them to fit together, and more adjustments for them to sit level. I'm disappointed in them. The only positive is that they are comfortable to sit on once you do finally get them together. I would not recommend them and wish I hadn't bought them."
3,"Still, it's a Pertwee!","Whether you agree or disagree with the overall story being good or bad, this is still a good way to get your Jon Pertwee/Katy Manning fix. I first saw this on PBS, luckily one episode each Saturday, in 1976.This is probably the weakest story of this particular season, although it promised a lot by being the first Pertwee adventure away from Earth. I think that too many elements were added for this story (Master, colonists, mining company, natives, Doomsday Weapon...eliminating something from it actually would have created more interest). The ending of Episode 2 is actually a fun cliffhanger.It was fun to note that Jo Grant's reaction in the TARDIS was no different than most of the other companions before her (bigger inside than out, NOT ON EARTH, OH MY!)."
3,"""Doctor! Come back at once!""","The Doctor gets a reprieve from his exile on Earth, only to do the bidding of the Time Lords. Landing on a planet with Jo Grant, the Doctor gets involved with some colonist close to starvation . Meanwhile, IMC, the ruthless mining corporation from Earth, is trying to remove the colonist from the planet. A very early politically correct/socially aware Who serial. It's also very padded and dull, but still fun. There are some silly-looking natives throwing spears and stones and a mud-fight. Captain Dents's hair-style is way cool...NOT! Not really much to say about this one, but it is far more interesting until the obligatory appearance of the Master arrives. Still, it's got it's moments. You just have to wait a while for things to happen..."
3,I agree with the other guys,"This story is typical of most 6-parters in Dr. Who, strong through the first 3 episodes but then dragged out as if it were really intended to be a four part story but they had to stretch it out.As I have been collecting Dr. Who videos since the Mid. 90's, and I'm hoping the BBC will release the rest here by 2004, buying or not buying this video was not the question.The biggest thing that stood out was the photocopied wall in the Doctor's TARDIS, which looked cheap.Unless you're a collector like myself, I wouldn't recommened this one."
5,A good story.,"I mainly purchased this one because the master is in it (Roger Delgado). He doesn't show up for the first few episodes but that's ok. The story features Jo's first trip in the Tardis and the first appearance of IMC.The special feature ""IMC Needs You!"" features interesting behind the scenes stories. Also ""from the cutting room floor"" has historical 16MM footage from on location filming - it's well preserved with great color."
2,Half Junk,"Sure I read some of the bad reviews but decided to go forward since I'd always had good products from Master Lock. Sure enough, half of the product was junk. The bad half is the smaller adjustable bar with blue jigger on the end. If you don't need that, no problem, the other part seems to work ok."
1,"Master Lock 2848DAT Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks,",got this lock set used it twice then the hitch pin stopped locking very cheap built would recommend spend a little more money and buy a good one
5,Perfect set for my camp trailer and truck,I didnt know you could even get a locking coupler bar. And keyed to match is so cool. I'm a first time trailer owner so theres a lot i dont know i'm sure but when i seen this set i had to have it. Been put on trailer and truck. All working good!
1,Any Key Will Do,Beware any master lock key will open this set. I have two different master lock pad-locks and both of their keys would open these locks. It seems that any master lock key will open this set so if security is important I would not buy this set.
4,Worked great for our needs - glad to have both sizes,"We purchasedPro Series 63153 Black 60"" x 24"" Hitch Mounted Cargo Carrierfrom Amazon in May 2011.The only thing we needed to purchase was a latch lock in order to lock it to our hitch on our Nissan Xterra (2001). We purchased this set from Amazon because we weren't certain of the size we needed. We ended up needing the smaller size - but now we have both. It worked great on keeping our carrier on our hitch. I would highly recommend."
5,"Works fine, as advertised","Works fine, came quickly, looks just like the picture so I'm not sure what some others are complaining about. I only need the 1/2"" lock now so would not mind having paid a little less and not have the others, but it was a decent price anyway."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"The PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT IS PICTURED. Amazon has shipped a different item EVEN after i called the to confirm that what i see is what i get....other reviewers has said they got a different than pictured locks. So i called them and WAS ASSURED that the item was as pictured. Tony said it was correct...........so i guess they either lied, or just made a sale from information they did not have to check.WHY PUT UP A PHOTO OF THE ITEM YOU WANT TO SELL AND THAN SHIP SOMETHING ELSE NOT EVEN CLOSE.It has been returned at their expense......If i were a marketplace sellerand did this i would be kicked off Amazon for deceptive practices"
3,Item isn't what is pictured,"The reason I ordered this was, the picture shows the key 90 degrees to the shaft... when I received the locks the key is inserted from the end in line with the shaft."
3,Be Careful!,"The receiver lock is OK but there is an issue with the hitch lock. It can appear to be locked but is not. After installing the hitch lock, checking it and thinking it was secure, I arrived at my destination with the pin still in place, but the lock had shaken free some where along the 30 mile trip."
3,Date-filled cookies,"This was a gift for my father, while he was in a temporary nursing home, which he shared with the others in the home. It was a success."
4,Suprisingly...It's Very good!,"I was shocked I enjoyed it so much but it took me about the 1st 15minutes to understand what it was. I'm not sure if it was a documentary or a film. Once I just went with it, I really enjoyed it. Chanda Fuller did a great job Directing the cast because I'm still not sure if it is real or not. The film was probably done with very money but it doesn't matter. Beverly Lynne and a couple of other girls, who I don't remember their names, are adorable..."
4,Interesting,"I primarily play with brushes, so I thought I would give these a try. While I would not recommend them for someone looking for a brush sound, they would work great for someone trying to quiet down their stick beatings. They are a little floppy, and they don't have much rebound, but I can safely say that I believe these will last forever, unlike similar sticks made of wood."
2,Multiple Camera Angles and Audio Tracks My Butt!,"Am I missing something? This title said there were both multiple camera angles and multiple audio tracks. There aren't. It's just a normal DVD with one camera angle and one audio track.Also, what was up with the segments? All but one of the segments were over in just four minutes! These were far too short. However, the last segment goes on for twenty minutes! This was far too long.This DVD is too tame and lame. Stick with ""Pets in Paradise 1 & 2"" and ""Penthouse Gentleman's Club"" for your fix. Those titles are much better."
2,zzzzzz,"I had great expectations for this Penthouse DVD, but I was quite disappointed. The girls are great, locations are great, but the acting and editing lacks a lot, sadly. These girls are pretending,(and) they are not at all convincing, it is quite boring in the long run. No juices running... I was looking forward to see Aimee Sweet having her way with those beauties, she can be very kinky..this time around she did not show that much, she is playing along, nothing more. I am not going to tell you about the details, it might be enough to say that the titles, like ""wheel of torture"" fi is far more promising than the final result. The girls make the two stars, Tera is a cutie!..."
1,[Disappointment],"This DVD doesn't offer any multiple angles or audio tracks and is shot really fast,leaving the viewer with two minute scenes and the last scene is too long.This DVD is as terrible as the cover with Aimee Sweet(yuck)but now she looks worse with already a tatto... In this its nausating to see her and the others were pretty but you only see them a few seconds or so due to terrible editing."
2,Peu utile,"Rien d'inoubliable. Son généralement très (trop) filtré et terne, au spectre étroit, mme dans les enregistrements les plus récents.Tous les chefs ont fait mieux en studio (Walter dans Beethoven -Sony-; Monteux dans Tchaikovsky - RCA-; Kertesz dans Schubert et Dvorak -Decca-; Solti dans Petrushka - Decca, avec Chicago!-; Tilson Thomas dans Jeux - Sony-; Abbado dans Berg (DG)). La 5ème de Tchakovski par Solti est la grosse déception du disque, moins emphatique et froide que ses versions de studio, mais neutre et insignifiante, avec une très ple 6ème de Schubert par Krips (écoutez Abbado - DG-!).Le beau Cockaigne de Prévin sauve la mise, mais les bonnes versions de cette aeuvre sont nombreuses. Le reste n'est destiné qu'aux archivistes."
3,Didn't find it that useful,"I am a foreign student studying medicine at a university in Japan. I don't know what it is but I just feel like this book is lack of something. I think the author has done a good job but even though it may be a good text book, it's not a book that you can use as a quick review. But well, it's worth the money buying because the text is easily understood especially for a foreign student like me who seldom use English in everyday life."
2,Practial guide to ecg interpretation,The book is very basic with little explanation of findings. It is less than I had hoped for in a book totally dedicated to one test analysis of heart heart function.
3,So so,"Its okay, kind of boring. I would recommend it if your in school but if your looking for something more in depth dont get this one."
2,Blows,This book blows. I read to book cover to cover and it misses alot of the key concepts covered on the exam. It dosen't go into enough detail in areas that need to be and goes into to much detail into subject such as utilities such as OEM. I don't even remember the book covering NLS topics. I suggest ordering a different prep book for this exam and buying STS software.
2,A decent but below average exam guide,"I used this book to study for the fundamental I exam. I read from cover to cover and basically this is a 8i book with a few pages on 9i new features. I don't think the author spend too much time incorporating the 9i materials in this book. After barely passing the exam, I have decided to buy the Sybex book for my fundamental II exam. Enough said."
2,Guide? Guide me to what exactly?,"- Lacks typical reference structure, making it tedious to find information.- Index is sorely lacking and doesn't have enough terms in it.- No quick reference lists or comparisons to differentiate 9i from previous versions.- Paragraphs used when bullet, numbered, or outline lists would have explained the concepts better.- Only a minimal amount of 9i specific information is included, which can be good/bad depending on one's experience level.Conclusion: Buy it used if you must indeed buy it."
2,Very poor guide,"I made the mistake of purchasing this book instead of the sybex study guide by Biju Thomas. The sample questions in the midst of each section are horrible, they ask stuff that wasn't covered in the chapter and are poorly worded. Half the time I don't really trust their answers.I used the sybex guide for the 9i SQL test and was much happier with that book, so I decided to buy the sybex guide for Fundamentals I, even though I had bought this book."
3,Average book for OCP Fundamentals II,"This book does not cover all the details for Fundamentals II. It is a good source for reference. The CD accompanied with the book has wrong answers for the questions. You may need to refer additional book(s), may be sybex one along with this one."
1,Many errors and misses the scope of the exam,"As per the previous reviews, there are many typos and misleading info in this book. At times the author loses track of 9i and speaks as if the book is about Oracle 8i (perhaps missing new 9i enhancements?). The book covers all the basic subject areas needed for the exam, but goes into detail where it doesn't need to and then completely misses the details that are required for the exam.I would have expected better from the Oracle Press."
3,Decent OCP book,I used this book to prepare for my Exam 1z0-031 but not as main reference. I used it to supplement the Sybex Study guide. It has some errors but I would say it is a decent book to use as preparation tool. I liked the practice exam questions. I did not have to buy any sotware for my practice exam questions. Those already in this book helped me.I give 3 stars and I will definitely recommend this book as supplement to the Sybex study guide if you are preparing for OCP exam Exam 1z0-031.
4,"Some problems, but helpful nonetheless","Although I haven't taken the OCP exam yet, I have been using this book (which I got with the OCP Oracle9i DBA Certification Boxed Set) as a reference during my training. Since the classes are compressed and fast this book has cleared up a lot of information that was only touched upon by my instructor.Since I have not taken the exam I cannot predict how useful this book is for preparation; however, it gives clear information and has more than once allowed me to understand concepts that I was unable to get in class.Note: there are editing flaws and inconsistent writing that do make this book ponderous at times. There have been times when I wished the authors and editors had paid more attention to the book, and other times when I silently thanked them for clarifying a concept."
2,Oracle 9i DBA Fundamentals I - Not Ready for Publishing!,"This book does a poor job of preparing you for the OCP DBA Fundamentals I Exam. The text book and accompaning testing software is loaded with grammer/syntax errors. In addition, the explanations are very brief and inadequate. Most importantly, the questions are not in line with the questions you will encounter on the exam. This latest book from author Couchman is a vast improvement over his previous works on Oracle 8 and 8i which were really simplistic. Although this is the only book at present for Oracle 9i certification, I strongly recommend waiting until the Sybex series are published. If the Sybex 9i books are anything like their predecessors - they will be EXCELLENT for preparing you for the real exam. In addition, the STS testing software is much more suitable than this books BeachFront quizzer. My advice is don't waste your money on this book."
1,Use something else for OCP exam preparation,"The book contains many typos, mistakes, misuse of therminology.A person new to Oracle would need to do a lot of extra work to decipher it.Look for other books to prepare yourself for OCP exam.BTW, the other book by J.Couchman, ""OCP Introduction to Oracle9i: SQL Exam Guide"" is no better."
1,A lot of mistakes,"I read this book...I found so many mistakes, that I never see before.In a concept of oracle, in examples of questions, just typeeverywhere. I don't know how somebody can use this bookfor prepare to the OCP DBA Fundamentals I."
2,Rushed,"The book is useful if you want to have an idea about what the new oracle 9i OCP exam is about. However, the book was obviously rushed. There are many inconsistencies and wrong information. The same applies to the attached CD. Really deplorable for a book that is supposed to help you get the right answer at the test.This book (at least in this edition) does not compare to the excellent standard of the much more reliable material for oracle8 and oracle8i similar OCP exam.My advice to the potential buyer: Get the book to have an idea of the scope of the exams, but make sure you get the appropriate information from Oracle documentation (Administration Guide).My advice to the author: Please, review your work!"
3,Not enough of a good thing.,"Peter McHoy is a MOST prolific writer and has covered all aspects of gardening. Why then is this book so thin? There are 4 chapters: 3 are a only few pages each and cover maintenance, how to purchase healthy trees, pest and disease control and how to care for the tree. All good material, but there could be so much more.The rest of the book is a directory of about 40 trees. Nothing wrong here either. There is a beautiful full page color photo of each specimen. There is all the information on the conditions the tree prefers. I like the sketch of the mature specimen, showing shape and size - very handy.So - why 3.5 stars? Simply because of the QUANTITY of information - not the quality. This may be a good addition to your gardening library, but you'll probably want more."
3,Modern Theological German,"I was assigned a translation from German to Spanish.I found the book very useful and almost all the vocabulary necessary. Unfortunately,German asa technicallanguage isnot easy to translate.There are very complicated sentence and paragraph constructions,usually much more difficult than bible citations.I recommend the author to touch upon articles taken from specialized theological where complicated constructions publications are usual.I coudn't find equivalences for 'Machterweise','der erhoehte Gott', and many strange verbswith the prefix 'ver'.I surely hope later editions will be more elaborate."
3,"Good, but...","My first choice is to get ""Manton's"" work on the same subject since Manton, from what I was told, covers German grammar, whereas Ziefle does not. The book starts off with translating German Bible texts, ones that the author assumes you are familiar with, and then goes on to more difficult works (Luther, Bonhoeffer, Barth, etc.). The problem that I ran into was that since I have zero German I had a problem identifying certain words that were not included in the dictionary in the back (which lead me to purchase a German-English dictionary). Also Ziefle does not cover any grammar, which means that you have to go out and purchase a grammar text. In the end you are spending more money then what you thought you would. If you can get a hold of ""Manton's"" text, I am told it covers grammar in it as well as some of the other stuff, do so. Unfortunately Manton's text is out-of-print so you will have to resort to spending lots of money on a used copy."
2,All action with many loose ends,"I just finished reading High Crystal this morning. It's the first time I have read it in about 20 years or more and to be honest it was a little disappointing.By the time you finish the book, you think that it has been edited down from a larger story, there are too many questions left to answer. Who is Odd Fossengan? What did he know? Who was he working for? Who killed Major Ryland? What did they learn from the pyramid? The list of questions goes on!Some of these questions are even asked in the book, but they are never answered, leaving the reader to wonder why they were even asked.All in all, the book appears to be an unfinished work, rushed out for publication and could even have been an episode in the 6 million dollar man series.So I would reccommend Cyborg but neither Operation Nuke or High Crystal."
1,Awful,"Our family recently saw some Iranian movies at a film festivle so I thought it would be fun to see more. However this proved me wrong. This film was horrible, weird and very boring. I do not recommend it."
5,An aptly presented and profoundly insightful collection,"Collaboratively compiled and edited by M. J. Daymond, Dorothy Driver, Sheila Meintjes, Leloba Molema, Chiedza Musengezi, Margie Orford, and Nobantu Rasbotsa, Women Writing Africa: The Sou-thern Region is an extensive, 554-page work detailing (from a distinctly women's perspective) the history, culture, social issues, and modern-day living conditions in the southern region of Africa. Countless personal testimonies form the core of this aptly presented and profoundly insightful collection. Women Writing Africa is enthusiastically recommended for African Studies and Women's Studies reference collections and reading lists."
4,The Great Pertwee,In this story I feel Jon shows why his Doctor is so well liked. It is his acting with Roger Delgado that keeps it moving and fun to watch. It is a great treat to see the late Ingrid Pitt looking beautiful and doing a decent job in the acting area. All of the cast does well and it is still Pertwee and Delgado that steal the show. Ending leaves you a little empty but all in all a great show. Fun for all!!!
2,"A great plot, but not enough action.","The Master is attempting to summon up Kronos, the Eater of Time, in order to gain the ultimate power. But in order to do this the Master will have to travel back in time to Atlantis. Now the Doctor and Jo must follow him in order to stop him from unleashing the greatest threat to all of time itself. A great plot, but it's ruined by not having enough action in it, a script that seems to drag on forever, and some corny parts added into it. It's worth watching, but not worth wasting your money on. Not recommended!"
2,NOT one to put at the top of your buying list.,"This is definitely not ""Doctor Who"" at its peak. This show could do both serious sci-fi drama or undemanding kids entertainment, but I don't think it managed to get either one right here. Even the high-camp Pertwee era, which was aimed straight at the kids, was usually much better than this. It is entertaining in its way, but despite being full of action and event, I thought it really went nowhere and didn't take an interesting route getting there.I could really pick it apart, but I won't bother. If you're a Doctor Who fan, you're probably familiar with it enough to know whether you want to buy it. But if you're not, I'd definitely reccomend you pick up something else first. ""Doctor Who"" was an amazing TV show, but precious little in this story will give you any idea why. Save this one for later."
2,"""I'm sorry to hear about your coccyx, too, Miss Grant...""","Before ""Battlefield"", there was The time Monster. A mix of sci-fi and Atlantean mythlogy. The Time Monster strarts out decent enough, with the return of the Master working on TOMTIT, sort of a temporal matter transmission machine, while the Doctor hunts him down with clues he had in a dream. there are some interesting ideas, and our friends from UNIT have some humor included. But, like all Pertwe six-parters, The Time Monsters comes to a complete and sudden stop when they reach the mythological Atlantis. A few good lines can't help the last 2 episodes. The scenes betwen the Doctor's and the Master's TARDIS are amusing, but this can hardly salvage one of the worst of Season 9."
4,A very good intro book,"While there are some small errors (ie: spelling , etc), as others noted, I found this overall to be an excelent intro book. The fact that Morelli covers each subject from multiple angles is a GOOD thing , espcially in an intro book. Not all of us learn the same way after all. Now, perhaps I am a tad biased, as I go to Trinity (Professor Morelli is a CS Prof. here). However I must say my initial reaction to using a ""locally"" written book, was one of worry. I was, of course, pleasantly suprised to find the book very well written with plenty of examples, lots of neat little ""tidbits"" which are clearly marked as non-essential if you're trying to find the key theme.I wholeheartedly recommend this book for classes as well as for reference , heck, this almost puts the teacher out of work !(a star is taken off for the occasional typographical error)"
2,Review - What else?,"This text is very wordy, over 950 pages from cover to cover. While I do not dispute the accuracy of the content, I am not swayed one bit by the way the author presented it.The author writes the text like a novel, trying to lead the reader into certain conclusions with the hope that the impatient reader (like myself and the many others who need to pick this language up in a jiffy) will understand it.For those who have the luxury of countless of hours to read 900 pages, then this is an excellent book."
1,Now that's bad quality!,"I bought this book for a Java programming class that I was taking. Upon opening the book to chapter 4, the glue in the binding broke with a loud snap, and the book now sits as if it's two books tethered together with a paper cover. I opened the book to a later chapter (probably around chapter 6?) and the glue in the binding snapped again! Now it's like I have three books tethered together by a paper cover. Later, I flipped to a chapter a few after 6, and the binding broke once again, so now I have an even bigger mess. I highly recommend that you avoid this book if possible. What a rip off."
1,Wordy and Pooly Organized,"I do not recommend this book. I only continued to read it because it was assgined reading for the course. The content could have been covered in less than half the number of pages, and with greater clarity and organization. As a reference, the book was virtually useless. Information on important topics was scattered throughout, coalescing around case examples in various chapters. Certainly not worth the $70, or whatever price is being asked."
5,Excellent as a Text Book,"It is very clear that the authors of this book have taught the subject many times and have shared their sucessful approaches and experiences with us via the book. The concepts build nicely throughout the book and the examples build in complexity as well. I particularly apreciated the optional sections covering graphical user interfaces in the early chapters. The early introduction of Object Orientation is a plus as well. Because the book provides a great deal of detail, it is an excellent compliment to lectures and assignments in a beginning Java course."
5,Just To Let Everyone Know...,"Most, if not all, of the errors pointed out in other reviews are from earlier editions of the book. I've found no errors in the Third Edition (so far). So don't let those dissuade you from buying this book. :)"
4,Baby Soft Skin,"Wow Mustela Ultimate Hydration is one of the most luxurious lotions I have ever used. I am 27 weeks pregnant and just started using this. I slather on the lotion after I shower and within minutes my skin is as soft as a baby's bottom. No joking. The only down side, and I have to agree with other reviewers, is the scent. It's not fruity and it's not floral.....it just smells like really sweet perfume. The scent is strong after application but after about 10 minutes you really can't smell it anymore. I love the texture of this lotion. It is thick like a boby butter and not greasy at all. I have never used a lotion that absorbs quite as well as Mustela. Highly recommend. If the scent was less strong or scent-free I would have given this product 5 stars."
3,Bring back the Old Scent!,"I agree with Elena, I loved the old scent of the Mustela Ultimate Hydration lotion. This is still great lotion but unfortunately I will be returning it due to the new fragrant scent."
3,Interesting Information,I am very interested in the Jewish religion and their practices. This book was enlightening and worth the read.
3,Why can't he be less irritating?,"There are some okay things in this book if you can get past the author's unbelievably irritating, smug, self-congratulatory, psuedo-intellectual style."
2,Why can't I like this book?,"I found Rabbi Smug-Married Boteach's prose to be too didactic, too condescending to take to heart, 'scuse the pun. I couldn't get all the way through the book because his incessantly complacent writing style got on my nerves. I can't accept that love is a necessity, not from someone who says ""I am the Love Prophet"" to send his points home. I think he has some thoughtful and worthwhile observations about the difficult situation us singles find ourselves in...as a society we are all finding that love is an increasingly more and more precious commodity that we dimiss as a luxury item. But it's hard to get past the lines of attitude that his language draws. ""I saw a woman on a plane, she had a problem, I said the exact words that delineated her problem and I know I made a difference in her life."" Yay for you, Schmuley."
4,It offers a different perspective...,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers...this was a provoking book. Rabbi Boteach's humor makes this rather insightful and ""heavy"" book an easier read. His focus on relationships as something sacred is refreshing...the idea that you are on your search for your ""true love,"" rather than just ""dating."""
3,What about the turndown?,"While much of what Boteach has to say is very true and relevant for serial daters he off handedly mentions the ""quiet guy"" or the ""shy girl"" who are on the sidelines of the dating scene. However, very little in his book applies to these individuals or would help them find love. They are often not commitment phobic, they are often not searching for flaws where there are none, they are simply never asked, or often turned down. Much of his advice could be useful to them if indeed they had someone to apply it with. Also, his notion of a ""two date minimum"" needs to have a better definition of ""obvious exceptions"""
4,"From a ""The Rules"" fan","I recommend this book as a way to help single people look at things we can change in our lives to fall in love. The luxury/necessity thing that others have mentioned is a big insight, as is the ""good enough"" marriage -- although he says he disagrees with Fein/Schneider's ""The Rules"" there are a lot of similar recommendations between the two books; just with different underlying reasons. I'm sticking with ""The Rules"" but it was still a good read and I will look for his other books."
4,Fast & Easy Waffles!,"My daughter loves these waffles, she did not like the Van's waffles at all, very hard and almost ""stale"" like. These are made in the microwave and taste like fresh waffles. The first time I made them, they were a bit doughy, but I just microwaved a few seconds longer and then toasted--so delicious and EASY!!"
3,Not much like your typical waffle,This product is edible but no where near the texture of a toasted waffle... More like soft non-fully cooked dough.
1,Oh my goddess... it's so bad.,"I really tried to like this book, and I just couldn't. Then I tried not to loathe it, and I didn't succeed with that one either. The plot, the writing, the characters--there's just nothing to like. It's painfully bad but not even so-bad-it's-funny. Oh dear."
2,Not a mace,The figure is holding a flail and a very poorly designed one at that. His cape or cloak would also be more of a hindrance were he actually in a fight.
1,Awful,this has got to be the worst singing by someone who has terrible singing voice.this was NOT Gary Puckett singing.
1,"Better, maybe, but still awful",I keep reading these books hoping for a return to the real Destroyer but it just isn't happening. The writer can tell a decent story but he just can't write Remo and Chiun. The only good thing I can say is thank goodness Gold Eagle is almost through with the series. A new contract has been signed with a new publisher that puts Warren Murphy back in charge of the books and Jim Mullaney will be back as the writer. We only have to suffer through until next April when The Destroyer returns for real.
5,Happy Again!!!!,My husband and I started to read these books right after we were married. But during the last few years they were very hard to find. Once more I can get them. Amazon comes to the rescue again.
1,This is the study guide and not the actual book,Don't make the mistake of buying this if you want the actual book. Amazon should mark this item clearly as a study guide.
5,Raymond Chandler at his best,".....even if these novels are by Leigh Brackett.If you, like me, love Raymond Chandler's detective storie and think it's a pity they are so few- Good news: Leigh Brackett, who had been called by Howard Hawkes to help John Steinbeck with the screenplay for ""The Big Sleep"" is a very, very good Chandler. Remember ""China Town""?One of the best Chandler adaptions I know, even if the story is not by Chandler himself.Brackett has long ago established her fame as an outstanding SF and Fantasy author.Well, she also did some glorious Westerns (Rio Bravo, for example) and her chandleresques Noirs.Don't miss them!"
5,Too good to be a book,An excelent overview of the political justice at Puerto Rico and how they dramatize elections events on the island
4,Best in Stable,"If you are new to Martin Hegwood, this is where to start. Other novels in the series are better than fair and worth the time( I prefer Green-Eyed Hurricane), but the necessary set-up information is here. Jack Delmas, divorced drop-out banker, private eye ( why are these P.I.s always retreads?) mixes with smugglers and bombers in an island setting in the company of a good ole boy ""bubba"" deputy sheriff with a high wheeled, swamp truck. Tavern brawls, parties with Jack's ex-wife's pre face lift crowd, and a next door group of costal undergraduates on weekend binge duty spice up an island inspired plot. This is a quick read, traditional who done what, that moves to a neatly prepared conclusion. Perfect book for a long plane ride or day at the beach."
2,"Ok, if you aren't baking layer cakes","I purchased 3 of these pans so I could bake layer cakes. The sides of the cake pan are slanted. When I baked a cake and started layering it, there was a definate Christmas tree look. Not what I want when layering and decorating. If I keep these pans I will have to trim the sides after the cake is layered and before it is frosted. To save time I will be looking for another set of cake pans."
1,Very sad,"The book is very basic and filled with alot of useless information. Also about 8 of the pages were completely blank. Someone was asleep during printing. As for the title clinician's handbook, well to be honest I found the same information in books such as guides for first time owners. I was looking for dose rates and more information on protozoa and parasites for my breeding colony. I found nothing in it. There was some information on bloodwork but not alot. Most of the information was on food values for iguanas. I dont have iguanas. Dont bother and waste your time on this book. You will better information if you get a ""Reptiles"" magazine."
1,You think THATS funny?,"Whats the point of making a movie about a Megalodon if it is only the size on an average white? I THOUGHT that the filmmakers were ripping of Steve Alten's MEG, but if they had actually READ the book then maybe they would know a thing or Two about Megalodons.. Not so.It would have been a helluva lot more cool to have an animatronic shark instead of footage, so that it could interact with the actors. Hell, JAWS did it 1975, how hard could it be to create a decent one nowadays?"
3,"The Crapiest movie in ""Z"" Movie History...","But - THE LINE - more then makes up for it! I have no idea who else was in this movie and honestly I didn't care. I bought it because I am a HUGE John Barrowman fan! During a TV interview, John admitted he did the movie because he needed the money. I think he should have just let the creditors have him.This is truly a Guilty Pleasure Movie. The CGI completely blows - one scene where the shark eats a man while in a motor boat looks like he was swirled down the shark's throat! It was also shot in Latvia (I think) but the setting is supposed to be Mexico, so EVERY SINGLE ACTOR'S VOICE IS DUBBED! Except for John and his two co-stars. The worst being one of the first scenes where the heroine is supposed to be talking to a night watchmen who is white, but speaks with a African-American jive accent. If this movie had been billed as a comedy, it would have made millions!"
1,Horrible,This movie sucks. It acting is god awful with a predictable hero by the name of ben who teams up with aplastic surgery disaster gone wrong paleontoligist whos name is Cat. Do not waste your money on this unless u want a few good laughs and enjoy low budget discovery channel shark attacks.
1,What do you say I take you home at eat your.......,"This movie has the most random movie line ever! So bad it's good! If you love crappy, campy movies, you just have to spend the money and get this. Don't watch it sober for even extra laughs! Raise you glass at the end when he asks ""Where's the cocktails?"" This movie makes it safe to return to the water!"
2,"It's a big shark , what else do you want ?","Was unaware of some brief nudity, but it was quick. Ordered for my son & friends. My son is a shark nut & is doing a report on megladons. Why I thought this was a documentary is another story. Any way, it sure did entertain my son ! The special effects have some really lame moments, but what can you expect ? No one really knows the whole sotry of a prehistoric shark livig in the modern world. That is the appeal of this b movie !"
2,Cheesy,"I just finished watching this movie on t.v. and I have to say I am disappointed. I love shark movies but this was just [bad]. I would not recomend that anyone purchase this movie-I wouldn't even pay to rent it. Wait till it comes on t.v.-You probably won't want to watch it again. I like watching shark movies for the shark-This ""giant"" shark was a normal sized shark they tried(and failed)to make look bigger. I can't count the number of times I laughed at the cheesy dialog. It was OK if you really, really like shark movies-but once is more than enough."
1,Terrible!!,"Not only did they not get the color right-all white-a simple but important detail, try watching this terrible movie on regular tv-with all the terrible voice-overs!! Fudge you, Gosh darn it....why did I finish watching this terrible movie-well maybe because I wanted to see how they painted this brutal, prehistoric, and interesting shark....Wouldn't pay a dime for this movie-as a matter of fact-they should pay me for the waste of my time watching it!!"
1,Don't even bother with this awful dud!,"One star is being WAY too kind to this dud!I had read ""MEG"", a great paperback that I highly recommend which was about prehistoric Megaladon sharks being pulled to the surface by accident and then wreacking havoc on modern man and thought this movie was based on this novel.To say I was sadly disappointed would be an understatement. All I have to say is that this film was made with some ""C"" grade actors and filmed in Bulgaria pretending to be Mexico with some really bad dubbing.This is one fish that should have been left in the deep..."
5,Hilarious!,"Loved it!It`s not scary at all!It`s funny!I mean,a man rides his Jet Ski right in to the sharks mouth!HAHA!You`ve got to see this!"
3,B MOVIE FUN,"While not of the ""caliber"" of the earlier shark attack movies, it is yet another fun escape from reality. Megalodon is a true B animal movie at its finest as giant prehistoric sharks attack. Definitely not oscar material but it is a fun way to waste a few hours. If you go in thinking it will be a great movie along the lines of JAWS you will be disapointed. But if you go in thinking its a B movie that will entertain you, you'll enjoy it."
3,cheesy acting but decent for shark lovers,"shark attack 3, has a lot of stale dialogue and cheesy acting but overall a decent movie for the shark lovers at heart imagine if you will a 80 foot long great white shark with a bad attitude! well thats what the film delivers, off the coast of mexico a beach resort is plagued by a number of unexplained shark attacks while out on a liesure dive our main guy ben finds a tooth buried in an underwater cable come to find out it belongs to a species of shark thought extinct for almost 30 million years, (carcharadon megladon) the great white shark's long lost relative, good action sequences, lots of gore and some good shark footage make up for some very bad acting and dialogue but as i said before if your a shark lover its worth a look but thats it, i wouldnt recommend buying this just go to your local video store and rent it for it holds very little replay value"
2,eh...,"Okay, I have never heard of any of these people in this movie, and I think that's a good thing. Beacause they can't act!! You see the sharks and they're like Oh my god. Look, its a shark. Like they don't really care. I think the idea of the megs being down deep and coming up is right out of the book MEG. The effects were pretty good, to take away from the crummy acting, but it was a bit cheesy when the giant shark came up. But if you're filming a movie with a 60-foot shark near people, it's hard not to be. The two stars are for the shark, in case you're wondering."
2,Bad,"I love Shark movies...I was too young for Jaws, but I always rent new shark movies. I saw 1 and 2. 3 interested me because this is the second shark movie about a megalodon shark. Well, trust me. Get the other one. This has bad acting and it's vaguely soft-porny. These people are begging to be eaten! It's basically about- once the damn story develops- a rift in the ocean and megalodons once thought to be extinct are protecting their eggs. The story centers around a baby and miscommunications, villains, and misconceptions. There's not much of a story. It's kind of; oh this thing underwater opened and here they are back again.I did read there is a NEW Megalodon movie coming out July 2004, so wait for that."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAH.....no,"I will put this bluntly: have seen better acting in porno movies, really I have. This movie is so horribly amazing that is makes watching the decay of the leftover popcorn on my living room floor look intersting. I honestly wonder what the director was on when this movie was created, because whatever it was...he should have refrained from offering it to the cast and the shark."
3,Nice story,"I started this book to counterbalance reading We wish to inform you tha tomorrow we will be killed with our families, but it turned out that By Bread Alone, despite its gentle title and lovely cover, is a pretty dark book, too. The characters were quirky and the plot was just slightly to the left of expected. There was a small forced quality to the story that made me lower my overall evaluation of it, but while it detracts from the book, it does not ruin the book."
2,Light reading,"I found it hard to relate to Esme - she just seemed so dizzy and was so over the top about things. I thought about not finishing this book, but it was fine for reading on a long journey with nothing better to do. I'm glad she finally grew up at the end."
1,0 for 2. Book worms dont know auto parts!,"I should have listened to Stephanie. What I received was not what I needed, not what was in photograph at all, not even for same car manufacturer. Not even worth one star. Total washout. It's what I get for buying auto parts from a book store!"
1,Wrong product wrong picture wrong company to buy from,Dont do it! I will never buy from Amazon again. I have had nothing but problems. I got the same wrong product twice and it took me about 20 calls or more to get my money back. Never again.
1,Book in need of an excorcism,"This book is a nightmare, all attempts of trying to use it as a text at the colleges where I teach were abandoned (sp?) three years ago. The text has simply become incomprehensible. Why there is an example of a secondary NINTH chord in chapter tow is beyond all logic and reason. I would suggest finding a used 1st-3rd Ed. (ALL supervised by Piston at a used book store) For something more current try Gauldin's wonderful ""Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music"""
1,The Perfect Fourth,"I am a composer and teacher of music theory - and have been for many years, both in an institutional and private basis. I have been using the Piston Harmony books for nearly thirty years, starting with the 3rd edition, onto the fourth, and then the fifth.When I got into the fifth edition I found that much of the clarity was destroyed and much superfluous material was added. The third was too terse, with not enough helpful explanation. The fourth edition is by far the best harmony book I have ever seen,and although I have not seen all of them, I find no reason to change from a perfectly clear system to anything else.[...]"
3,"for beginners/self-studying, hard to understand...","if you have NEVER studied harmony before, it is probably the best place to start. this book does get into the very details and advance level of harmony, but it does not give much explanation. would be beneficial if someone is coaching at the same time."
1,The most over-praised musical textbook of the 20ty centruy,Piston's Harmony was the worst book I used in six years of classes on the undergraduate and graduate levels. While there were many reasons for this one of the most important was that Piston's theory of harmony makes no sense. The figuring taught by this book is useless for anything but showing your teacher that you can write the numbers under the chords.If you are lucky enough to be able to choose your own textbook Roger Session's out of print Harmonic Practice is a far better book.I didn't really learn anything about harmony until after doing counterpoint exercises (from Jeppesen's Counterpoint) at the keyboard. Eventually learning to play from a figured bass and training your ear is the only real way to learn diatonic harmony. Short of that try to improvise. Just about anything which deals with actual music making is better than Piston's note drawing exercises.
1,inferior college textbook,"This is tedious, but I suppose it must be said. Unlike Mark Harrison's ""Contemporary Music Theory Level 1"", for example, this book is not intended for amateur pop musicians; it is a college textbook intended for freshmen music students. Thus useful reviews will be addressed primarily to college teachers, those who assign textbooks. On the other hand, a prospective student may wish to choose his teacher by what text he assigns or he may wish to supplement his assigned text. There are many freshmen harmony textbooks available. This is not more ""serious"" than any other, but its current (fifth) edition and the edition preceding it make a complete botch of teaching harmony.(Self-styled autodidacts beware: The essence of harmony is part-writing, and part-writing skill can not be acquired without objective and independent critical evaluation of part-writing exercises--you can't learn it solely from a book.)"
1,The Bane of my Existance,"I had this text for my second semester for 5 part diatonic harmony. There are those texts where one underlines or highlights parts of the book. This whole book was underlined and highlighted. Gives vexing tedium a new definition. I know, I know ""It's a college text"", it was still a very difficult text to digest."
4,The Best History of The Wall to date.,This is a History Channel production that lives up to their expected high standards. I believe this is the best history of The Berlin Wall available in The US and will not disappoint. Excellent computer generated graphics that describe the amazing design of the wall and death strip.
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"This was an extremely difficult DVD to find on the internet; that is, until I checked Amazon.com! With one click shopping, my order was placed and promptly received. This was a surprise gift for a friend of mine who actually worked on building the Berlin Wall. He was elated and couldn't believe I had found what he had been looking for for months!! Thank you for being who you are and doing what you do!"
5,great candle,Lasts as many hours as it says. Has a great smell to it and came a a beautiful box. I always order these candles!
3,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I loved this tapestry and wasn't thorough enough in reading the detailed description. This is nearly SQUARE. This is not the long, narrow shape as pictured. It is, indeed, beautiful, however, do be cautious! Read dimensions carefully."
3,Doesn't Fit in Hole!,"I bought this lock pin to go along with a cargo carrier for the back of my 2004 Mercury Mountineer, which has a 1.25"" hitch receiver. The lock itself is a fine product, but the issue is the thin gasket that the lock needs to actually lock onto the pin -- the gasket was just enough to keep the pin from fitting into the holes in the hitch and hitch receiver. Once I ripped the gasket off the pin (rendering it useless as a lock) it fit just fine. So, be prepared for it to be a tight (or non) fit."
1,Same problem with the O ring,I hoped the O ring problem on another reviews was an isolated incident. Lesson learned. Return costs almost as much as the item so I just have to suck it up.
1,Piece of garbage...doesn't like MN winters,This lock did not hold up to the MN winter. Road salt got under the cap and into the lock and had to finally drill it out to get it off. Just my experience.
3,Nice lock! -- but --Dosen't fit Bike rack 30901 EZ-2,"30901 EZ-2 hitch platform 2 bike rack does not allow clearance for this locking pin, AND SHOULD NOT be avertized as being sutable to use with this bike rack, This bike rack has a ""bolt"" to attach to the car's hitch and is secured with a 3/4"" wrench and not too many ""bike rack theves"" carry a tool set with them. So needless to say this will not work on this style bike rack, the bike rack is fine, it's just this will not work on the 30901. I'd send it back but it would cost more than it worth to return.I feel safe bolting the 'rack to the hitch' as theives are inherantly lazy and don't usually don't have a 19mm or 3/4"" wrench to undue the rack from the hitch,NIce lock Just won't work in this application!"
5,Good good product,Easily accessible. I've had it on for several months through every type of element and the lock mechanism works perfectly. I couldnt say that for the product I replaced with this part.
3,Quality Lock,"This is a fine lock for the price, but is only good for locking on my hitch cover. I didn't realize my bike rack mount needed a specialized locking bolt only available from the manufacture (Thule)."
4,Solid Locking Option,"Works well to secure the hitch and the peace of mind that occurs is well worth the minimal cost. The unit comes with 2 pins and the rubber ring on the 5/8"" pin was very loose and basically useless. It would get pinched outside of the lock and defeat the weather-proofing purpose of the ring. I had no need for the 1/2"" pin so I swapped the rubber rings and called it a day. The rubber cover around the lock is great for keeping the elements out and prolonging the life of the lock. Comes with 2 solid keys and the lock portion rotates easily to lock and unlock the unit. Overall, I am happy with it."
2,"The 1/2"" pin is loose","The 5/8"" pin fits nice and snug in the lock and seems to be well made but the 1/2"" pin seems to be loose and I'm afraid that water or dirt will be able to seep in. And of course this is the one that I need for my hitch. I will update my review later after I see how long it lasts."
5,Finally! A pin I can use,"I have an '07 Ford Explorer with a heavy duty Class IV hitch and electronics. This is the third locking pin I have purchased, and the first one that would actually fit. Because of the location of the electic ""plug,"" none of the other pins I purchased would lock. I needed a locking pin because I hae a very nice receiver cover and I didn't want anyone to walk off with it. The pin was just what I needed with the swivel lock."
5,Don't Lose Your Keys,"This is a solid lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers. Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it). The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers. The larger pin works with Class IV. I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys. The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility. This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price."
2,NOT A THINKWAY BUZZ LIGHTYEAR,"If you are looking for quality Woody and Buzz Lighyear toys, look somewhere else. The original Buzz Lightyear toy was and is made by ThinkWay. These toys are cheap copies at best. The Buzz doll is very light when compared to a Thinkway and appears to be cheaply made. Buzz's wings aren't even opened by the button on his chest (the ""button"" on his chest doesn't do anything) as you would expect, but rather by a button on his back. In addtion, there is a small clear plastic removable thing near Buzz's helmet which could be a real choking hazard. The Woody doll is so stiff you can't really call him a rag doll. We purched this at the Disney Store for $9.98 and about 1 hour after opening it we sent it to the grandparent's house."
5,amazing scholarship written with clarity and grace,"This book is clear enough to be read by a lay person like myself, but offers so much scholarly depth that a specialist would find much to learn."
3,Not suitable for turntable,"It's pretty (I have the cherry one), but it will vibrate front to back, and there's no way to brace against this. To make things worse, mine seems to resonate with the turntable, so that once it starts shaking, it doesn't stop before bouncing the arm right into the air. (Think Tacoma Narrows Bridge.) Nice piece of furniture if you're all digital, though."
5,Very entertaining British series,"This is one of the best comeday/drama series to come out of Britain. I have seen several episodes on PBS but there is nothing like having the DVDs to watch at your leisure. Great actors, great writing and excellent stories make for an entertaining hour of TV. The show has a serious side but the focus is on the very subtle comedy this four people convey on screen. There is a very good chemistry among the characters and they are all unique. The ladies man, the neurotic, the wise old ""leader"" and the excellent Detective Superintendetn Pullman. If you are a fan of British comedies or light police procedurals then you will love this series. I just wish the DVDs were released more quickly to the USA. Great show."
3,Poor quality case,"Enjoy the DVDs, have seasons 1-5 but the packaging is of very poor quality; the insert that holds the discs has broken where it attaches to the case on three of the five cases. They were already broken when the cases were first opened, before they were ever handled."
1,Not Family Friendly,"After carefully reading the reviews and noting that some of them said this series was ""family friendly"" I ordered the second season because it cost the least. Today we watched about 15 minutes of the first episode of the 2nd season and not less than 6 times there was foul language, men peeing in the men's room, very unpleasant innuendos that I suppose were suppose to be funny and a man who had a sex change. Fifteen minutes was all we could take and thus we are out the money paid for a ""family friendly"" series."
4,New Tricks: Season 2,"This is part of a British TV crime series. It is about a woman Metropolitan Police supervisor, who is a rising star in the department, but due to no real fault of hers, she is sidetracked into UCOS. A brand new unit to solve cold cases, but she will be the only active police officer in the squad. Her squad is to be retired detectives. The characters are all played beautifully. The various cases run the gamut, and it combines beautiful humor, with the true frustrations found in police work. The cases and the trails to discovery are well done and believable. A really enjoyable series. The only flaw is we have 22 episode per season in most of our programs, and they have 9."
2,A Little Disappointed,"Love my Lodge cast iron dutch oven and was anxious to try some new recipes to cook up in it. However, this book is designed for those using it on a campfire (although kitchen conversions are available) and there is way too much emphasis on wild game and desserts. All but about 2 or 3 of the recipes simply don't fit our tastes."
5,My favorite cookbook!,"I've was looking at different dutch oven cookbooks and I'm so glad I purchased this one. Most of the recipes are simple and easy and some a little more complicated. It's a great book and I'm extremely happy with it. I've already made some of the recipes and I'm looking forward to making more of them, if not all!"
5,Great Cookbook,"A must add book for every Dutch Oven library. Order one now, you won't be disappointed."
4,review,THE BOOK GIVES VERY USEFUL INFORMATION.THE CLARITY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS IS AMONG THE BEST.THE ATTENTION TO DETAILS IS IMPRESSIVE.
1,Egyptian Secrets??,"Bought this book figuring it would talk about the ancient gods of Egypt, magics and spells from those times etc.What you actually get on the other hand is a hodge podge of reciepes for getting rid of diarrhea and such. All of it calling on the power of Christ, the son and holy spirit.. yada yada yada...Nothing Egypt about this book. No great secrets. Just a boring let down."
4,Fo' sho!!,"Last time I heard this was on LP and I was 13 or 14 years old. I still remember most of the tracks by the sheer impact they had on my soul. Very, very funky album...It was a hit on 8 track and they didn't have fast-forward---needless to say it's all real music. Go on and cop that, you won't find it in stores."
1,Lowering quality with rising price -> Disappointed,"I weighed new shirts and they contain significantly less cotton than shirts that I bought years ago and have been wearing and washing! They are definitely not what I wanted or expected. Quality is going down as price goes up! Disappointing! I'm willing to pay top prices for top quality, but please don't sell me crap for the same or higher price!"
2,Bad Quallity-High Price,"Calvin Klein Men's Basic Crew Neck T-Shirt, 3-PackBefore wearing, I washed these shirts in the same load with new Calvin Klein men's briefs. The shirts turned pink while the briefs remained white. After numerous washing they remain noticably pink. I would think twice before buying this product again."
5,Great Undershirts!,Bought these undershirts as a Christmas gift for my husband and he was thrilled. They were high quality and will certainly order more.
2,Just Another Baggy T-Shirt in my Closet,"These shirts used to be great because they fit so well. But I'm afraid there has been a re-design and now it's like putting on a tent. The shoulders are right for a large, but the torso is huge. I feel like a formless blob in these shirts."
5,nice,"The package arrived on time and without any complications. Excellent article, 100% recommended. thanks alot for your service and stuff.thanks again"

1,XXL is no good,"These shirts are short and wide, leaving more room then needed but too short. These shirts are not like the ones i ordered last year. Very disappointed, seems like the maufactured location changed and decreased quality."
1,bad fit.,"I bought these shirts (black, medium) to wear on a daily basis, and I am disappointed. First off, they don't fit like the old CK crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washings, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from CK. I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts. I'd rather pay more for American Apparel or Banana Republic."
1,They shrink; another attempt to cut costs loses customers,"I agree with other posters. These used to be great shirts. Not any more. Five cycles through the washer/dryer and I can't tuck them in.I am so tired of this experience. These were the last, good tshirts that I could find that wouldn't shrink (Jockey let me down a few years ago). I had a difficult time paying so much for tshirts, but was willing to tolerate it since the rest shrink. I might as well buy cheap tshirts every year. At least then I won't be left with expensive rags!"
2,The Quality is Dropping,"These were my favorite t-shirts in the past - nice and heavy weight, very good quality cotton. I just got some new ones and they immediately felt thinner. I took and old one and put it on the kitchen scale where it weighed 6.0 ounces. The new one came in at 5.4 ounces! I went to the CK website thinking maybe I ordered a different model number than before, but there was only the one 3-pack, classic crew offered, which the single reviewer there gave a rating of a 1 for similar reasons."
2,Not-so-white white,"I ordered a couple of 3-packs of the white t-shirt and they all had a noticeable pink cast, and it didn't come out in the wash. Quality control doesn't seem to be what it was."
3,"High price, middle quality","I do think quality and value is going downward with these CK tee's. I recently bought 3 3-packs & almost every shirt had a string unthreading itself at the arm. I'm afraid to clip them or yank them for fear of my shirt comming apart. It's especially bad after washing & drying them. The do shrink a bit after the first few wash cycles, but not excessively, in my opinion. Or maybe it's just that I'm putting on weight :)Overall, however, they are fairly comfortable tee's and I like that there is no longer a tag at the neck: it is an iron-on tag.These tee's are overpriced."
3,Boots on valve cover,"These wires are nice; they are identical in length when compared to the stock wires. The leads for the spark plugs are very good quality; however, the sealing boots around spark plug tubes on the valve cover are too small and do not fit as the stock wires do."
4,tv turntable,"This TV Turntable is exactly what I wanted. It work very well, a smooth action. I an very satified with it."
4,Works as advertised,"Sanus Systems TV27 TV Turntable (Black, 27 Inch)Product has worked well. It was easy to assemble, but I wish that I had purchased the attachment for the DVR!"
4,KG 200,Excellent book with photos of a little known World War 11 German unit. For history readers it's a informative book and well written.
3,Needs a bit customization for door mount option,"The product is good. The frame etc. is quite solid and only wobble from side to side slightly when pulled. Beware though if you want to consider the door mount option with theRev-a-Shelf Door Mount Kit for RV Series White. The screws included in the door mount package don't work. You'll have to use flat head screws (6/32) to secure the mounting kit to the slide. This way, the screw head will be leveled with the slide bar and the whole thing can actually slide around freely just like without the door mount."
4,right size for my under sink cabinet,"This is the only pull out trash bin I can find to fit into my under sink cabinet with less than 9"" in width. Taking out one point for no cover. If I can find a matching cover to close the top while not in use, it will be perfect."
4,the small one,"I should have given the gift of the larger model, but the small was the one requested. If you want to hide your trash and save space. . . this is for you."
5,Works like it's supposed to,"So far so good, we ordered this a couple months ago and installed it under our sink because that is much more convenient. We pull it in and out very often, cause we do a lot of cooking. Slides smoothly and easily, it seems like the sliding mechanism will hold up, hopefully."
5,Fits perfectly,I had bought a taller product previously and it was too tall for my kitchen cabinet. This fits perfectly under the sink plumbing and no more scraping up the bottom of my cabinet from sliding the wastebasket.
2,You get what you pay for,"Warning, this product doesn't work with the Rev-a-Shelf Door Mount Kit for RV Series White (see my reviewRev-a-Shelf Door Mount Kit for RV Series White). After quite some extensive customization I was able to install both the pull out bin and the door mount. Since I have a narrow cabinet door, the only other option I had was the Häfele hardware, which is much more expensive. This one works. Sort of. It is a bit wobbly and doesn't have that smooth, solid feel of the more high-end furniture hardware."
2,"Not as advertised, and not worth the price.","The packaging was horrible, it only came with 4 screws and no instructions or documentation. I should have just bought this locally. Unimpressed."
4,Good Bargain,"This is a functional razor. I don't have a heavy beard and get a good shave in well under a minute's time.Easy to clean unlike my last Norelco.Only problem seems to be it needs a charge every week. But it charges right up and you can shave with it plugged in if necessary.If you're looking for a good electric razor at a very reasonable price, you can't go wrong."
5,love it,"Beautiful satin gown. It was exactly what I was looking for. Lace in the back center of the gown. I ordered the black, but may also get the blue."
4,Husband LOVED it!,"This is beautiful, and feels great. I gave it a 4 star because it was a bit tighter than the sizing chart lets on."
4,"Great entry camera, Great portability!","This is my second digital camera. The first being a much more expensive, larger SLR-type camera. Frankly, I ended up getting rid of the expensive camera and keeping the Fuji. It's small, takes great photos, is easy on batteries and easy to use. The controls are easy to use and not intimidating for beginners. The 1.3 megapix resolution is very good and better than most need for the majority of situations. This camera is so compact that I find myself taking it more places, more often. Definitely recommend a USB Smartmedia card reader to speed up transfers to the computer. I recommend NiMH batteries (2 sets of 4) and a NiMH battery charger."
4,A Great Product For the Price,"I have had this camera for several months and really enjoy using it. The picture quality is excellent and the controls are easy to use. You will definitely want to heed the other reviewers' advice and get a card reader to speed up the transfer of the pictures to your hard drive.I use this camera indoors and out to take pictures of my orchids and have no complaints in either situation. If you are looking for a low-cost digital camera, give this one a try."
2,I've had problems,"Besides the lag problem mentioned in another review, I've had an issue with the camera not staying on when switched. I miss about 80% of the shots I'm trying to take because I have to keep turning it back on, taking out the memory card and/or batteries and replacing them etc. Bad frame errors are haunting. Once it starts working, I can usually take many pictures in a row, but in the beginning it's horrible. This is all probably my fault for trying to snap a picture when the dial was turned to the viewing mode. But that shouldn't have harmed the electronics! One can't always remember to get the dial in the right position."
5,Extremely interesting...,"If you read this historic novel, you will come as close as possilbe to actually enduring the entire Long March and Cultural Revolution in tact. I personally find 20th-century Chinese history to be some of the most interesting (and altogether important in understanding its future) and this novel is packed with history that will build a base for understanding modern China. Sure, like most works, it has bits here and there that are hard to believe, but all in all, this book not only informed me, but it encouraged me to visit Beijing (Peking) which I did in Nov 2004. Wonderful!"
3,trial #2,"Product has helped with crustiness of area, is not greasy copared to other products. No remarkable change seen otherwise."
1,Not loud enough,this is total trash. it is not loud enough to get anyone's attention. look for something else.
5,Disco by Albert Goldman,"The origins of disco music are the central issue of this book, which was written in the late seventies. The idea of discotheque was originally created in France and was taken to America in the early sixties. The first disco DJ in America was Slim Hyatt. DJ Terry Noel, however, took deejaying to another level and eventually, in the late sixties, Francis Grasso introduced the technique of slip-cueing, which orginated modern mixing. Also, very popular discotheques like Studio 54, Loft, etc. are treated here. Besides, Goldman focuses on the disco stars, i.e. figures like Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Cerrone, Alec R. Costandinos and so forth. Highly recommended if you are interested in how disco came about."
2,Interesting,"This album is about 2.5 stars. I really can't stand it when people put 5 stars on sub par albums just because they like the group or because they want people to buy the album.The CD starts off well, but then kind of just puts you to sleep or makes you want to fast forward. Near the end though it picks back up.The other review is pretty dead on about the amount of eclecticness (If that's a word). However I prefer to call it a mish mash since it at times sounds like a compilation of demos. I mean only about %20 of the tracks actually sound polished. Overall the rest sound like bands with potential, but that will be destined for anonymity.It's a good effort, but I'd say that one should only pick this album up if it's cheap and if you one wants to sample some MFR tracks that range in quality just as much as they range in genre."
4,"Einstein of Sex, Foundation of the Gay Movement","Magnus Hirschfeld may not be a name well known in the U.S., but his studies and institute in Berlin advanced the gay movement as much as the Stonewall riots - and this was in 1943.This biopic of a great man is very well done by director Rosa Von Praunheim. The DVD offers a documentary in addition to the film and an interview with Von Praunheim.The film is in German, with English subtitles. There is quite a bit of male frontal nudity, but this is far from a pornographic film. It is a very well researched, well done biography of the man who coined the term - transvestite.Definitely recommend this film for anyone's library. It is an important record of our gay history"
4,Works great,"I purchased a 22"" television for my office which had to fit into a space under a hutch. I wanted to view the tv from different locations within the office and had to manually turn the tv as it did not have a swivel base. I searched local retailers for a swivel base but was unable to find one. I located the turntable on Amazon and found that even with the additional height I had a whopping 1/4"" space between the the tv and the hutch. Coudn't be happier."
5,Does What It Claims,Can only say that this turntable rotates smoothly and DOES ITS JOB perfectly. No higher praise! I use it to hold a bedside radio to combat nighttime fading
4,Great module to explore a different culture,"This module was originally an official tournament module at one of the big conventions in the 70's, hence it's narrow focus on a one-dungeon setting and seeming lack of plot. Designed for a small party of 3rd - 6th level characters, it can be played through in one or two sessions.What I found most appealing was the introduction of a completely different, Meso-American setting highlighted by the included supplement depicting various rooms and features of the dungeon. Erol Otis' artwork is especially well-suited to this mileu, just as his was to the H.P. Lovecraft mythos in the first ed. Deities and Demigods.Problem-solving and wariness are critical to success in this adventure; don't count on a whole lot of hacking and slashing."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This adventure is a random collection of encounters tossed together with no logical pattern, rhyme and/or reason. What makes it annoying is why all of these monsters are living together in such a confined space. No explanation is given. This is the sort of adventure that you come up with for your friends when you're 12. Just a bunch of monsters and fighting, and it isn't a complete adventure. There are places in the book where it is up to the DM to fill in the details. Sound nice in one sense, but you are paying for the book. You could've saved your money, and made up stuff anyway."
4,The Prince and the Pauper,The book very well authorized the life of two different boys. The situation had split them into the monarchy and the very por class. When these boys switch places they are in for an experience they may never have wanted to see. The saying goes the grass is not always greener on the other side.
4,Victory DVD,"this dvd has 13 songs from many victory bands. as for a record label dvd it is nice it has the songs as well as a few special features, but i would like more such as commentaries, but beggars cant be choosers. overall a very good dvd if you are into hardcore music or Victory Records."
4,A Look at the Legion's Growing Pains,"The second volume of the DC Archive Editions collection of the Legion of Super-Heroes, DC's premier heroic team of the future, shows both the strengths and the weaknesses of their early comics. While there are some important tales here (such as the resurrection of one character), there are also too many asides as various supporting characters from Superman's world take over. Add the assorted adventures of the Legion of Substitute Heroes and the Legion of Super Pets and the volume goes a little adrift. There is an excellent introduction from Paul Levitz and fans of the team will enjoy it. But, to be candid, this is not a book for everyone and even a good number of comics fans will not like it and it is a little pricey unless you are a die-hard Legion fan."
1,Weak content,"As a graphic designer, I purchased Logopower for an indepth look at designing logos. What I got was a watered down overpriced book that really disappointed me."
5,Awesome Book!,"this is such an awesome series...easy to read, but fun, too! Has some cool recipes, chicken piccata is the BEST!"
3,its ok,"Its just like any other powder. nothing special about it. i only used it once because i prefer baby powder. another thing, the whole of where the powder comes out from is like a shampoo hole and not tiny hole for easy spread out."
3,Facial exercises,DVD is complete and explanation very clear with even a short version when you have limited time. Time will tell whether it really makes a difference.
3,darling design,"These plates are a fun novelty item. The designs are just great. However, if you're looking for excellent quality, this is not the right item for you. They break easily and two were broken when I opened my package. However, Amazon gave me a discount and I was happy with the way it was handled. Everyone comments on these plates and enjoys them. I recommend them with the caveat not to pay too much."
1,Terrible taste,"I am a huge fan of the V-8 100% vegetable juice flavor, and even the lemon-enhanced flavor, anti-oxidants and calcium-enriched ones but the low sodium? Ptooey! I didn't realize having 75% less sodium in the bottle would make such a huge impact on flavor but it sure does. Both my husband and I bought a huge bottle and after two glasses cannot stand the flavor. We're likely going to toss the rest down the drain, what a waste!"
5,GREATNESS!,"What a story great story on the best to ever grace this world. Can't say enought so i just keep saying great, great and great again."
3,Could Be Better,"This is a strange concert. The actual footage is great; Black Sunday is played flawless, especially. However, the need to have stupid ""concept"" pieces ruined parts of songs, and songs are cut and left out and the special effects are awful; witness mirroed a thousand times during the first singing section of ""songs from the wood"" which is, by the way, began in the middle. if you get the A remaster, dont' bother with this."
3,Didn't work for us,"My daughter is very limited in what she likes and she eats very small amounts. She's never refused to eat so I wondered if it would be the right book for us. I was looking for strategies to increase her diet variety besides the usual ""try it over and over because it takes 15 tries"". I have been down that road and I end up frustrated, and dd ends up still eating only cheerios and yoghurt. The book was a little difficult to follow, and as I suspected was not for our situation. I think if you have an extreme feeding situation with your baby or child, this may work for you. For less drastic situations, I liked Ellyn Satter's ""How to get your child to eat..but not too much""."
3,Mixed feelings,They flashed brightly and looked reasonably well made but most of the bulbs caused my blinkers to flash fast. I bought some amber Sylvanias at the store (for a much higher price) which worked perfectly.I did not return these bulbs because I dropped and lost a few of them between my car and my front door. I've decided to save the rest of them just in case.
3,A Mixed Review,"It's a brilliant addition for the working jeweller. Easy to follow and with clear instructions with a step by step format.It allows you to produce excellent paint ups for customers and for your own decision making.The drawback is that you need the templates, which are not available from Amazon, and cost an aditional $60."
3,Not at all like the book,"I love Tony Hillerman's style and characters. I also love Robert Redford as a director. So I was totally at loss when I watched this movie,which possibly had 3 things that had been in the book. The actors were good and I think I would have liked some honesty from Hillerman and Redford acknowledging that the movie and book had little in common, but the characters. However, live and learn - watching the movie again, (not as a Hillerman book) -I have to admit it wasn't to bad - except for the teenage gang and the hand in the soup"
2,"If you have read skinwalkers, don't watch it!!","This movie barely has any parts that are similar to the actual Tony Hillerman Skinwalkers novel! Some important characters are taken out of the book, while new characters were also added! The Murderer isn't even the right murderer! Leaphorn's personality is all wrong and Chee gets to angry! This is only a good movie if you ignore all the differences between it and the book. If you haven't read the book, it will be a good movie. But, the book is much better!!!!"
1,Misinformed Writer,"Hillerman does not know Navajo life and culture, and the plot is totally alein to Navajo people and culture. Those actors and actresses in the movie are not Navajos, do not act or look like Navajos, and the scenecry is not like Navajo land. This is a story about a fictive tribe and culture that exists in the minds of Hillerman and Redford. The Navajo Nation totally rejected this movie when it was shown to them, and that is why it was not filmed in Navajoland and does not use Navajo actors."
3,Skinwalkers,Really good movie -- and you just can't see more beautiful landscape. Movie filmed on location and on the Rez which only added to this movie. Definitely recommend.
4,Great Mystery for mystery lovers,"The Director has given us a wonderful version of the Tony Hilerman novel. It is a wonderfully refreshing view of both the modern and traditional Indian way of life. How both of the main characters interprete the clues to this mystery keeps you wondering ""who done it"" along with them. It was an extremely enjoyable watching experience."
5,Amazing story.,This is one of my favorite Korean movies because its a beautiful film. I would recommend this to everyone. This movie made me cry.
5,Great Workout!,"This is an awesome workout! I own or have used just about every single fitness DVD know to man, and this is one I keep going back to. The workout has a nice, fast pace, but not so a beginner couldn't keep up. Lindsay does a great job combining fat-buring cardio with muscle sculpting weight lifting. She really targets every single body part, so you feel the burn! I would recommend this to everyone, because the workouts are as intense (or light) as you want them to be!"
3,is this supposed to be a core workout?,"I have really liked all of Lindsay's workouts, but this dvd is way too slow. If this had been called core fitness I would have thought it was pretty good. But, ""shed 5 fast""? No way. Do the bootcamp workouts for 30 minutes if you wanna shed 5 fast. This is a very slow paced workout with lots of non-cardio moves.Too many ""jabs"" and punches. too many standing side oblique crunches!!I really like the screamers and the lumberjacks in workout 2, but other than that, nothing is challenging.Bottom line:If you are a beginner, don't have much weight to lose, and want to get a decent workout where your heartrate may elevate for a short period of time, try this workout."
3,Good for beginner/intermediate levels,"This dvd was OK. It would be good if you're tired & don't have a lot of energy or have never worked out before or just starting out. Although there are different levels, at the end of it I didn't feel as winded & tired as I would've wanted to be, especially if this is to ""shed 5 fast."" The strength training intervals were good, but the cardio was weak - if you don't like kickboxing I wouldn't recommend Lindsay's dvd since she does a lot of kickboxing for the cardio portions."
5,Love it!,"Lindsay Brin has helped get me in some of the best shape of my life, first with Post Natal Bootcamp and now with Shed 5 Fast! With this video I have continued to get stronger and leaner. Not only do I look good, but I am doing pushups! Not even girl pushups, REAL pushups! Lindsay is a great motivator, knows her stuff, is not annoying and is clearly in excellent shape herself. I love that this video is 30 minutes. I really needed a quick but excellent workout and that is exactly what this is. There are 2 great workouts so you don't get bored. I love the variety of exercises and that there are new exercises I have never done before on this video. Thank you Lindsay Brin for kicking my butt! I feel amazing and strong and that gives me great confidence!"
4,Good workout!,"I really like this video. I haven't started using the second workout, but the first is challenging. (I'm an intermediate excerciser) There is a lot of emphasis on inner thighs, but it works your whole body, including abs. It's a good, complete workout and seems to go by quickly. I'd recommend it."
4,A good general stand - not high end,"Bought the cherry version of this and currently have a 32"" TV on which is heavy 175LBS and the stand handles it but always seems a little scary when I get near it and wonder if the glass will break. It should hold it but I would shy away from this stand for very heavy TVs. Solid construction and no blemishes even though it is another made in China product. You cannot beat the price since other wooden stands can cost 2-3 times more but only look slightly better. If price is an issue this is a good buy."
2,Not My Best Read Book on Wicca,"While it is okay, it is just another book written with the same information as many other basic book on this subject... not much for the mind to dwell in, but a decent book for the beginner, or curious."
4,"OK as Wicca 101, Great for begginers in Herbalism","This was the first book I read about Wicca. It's OK for someone who knows nothing about Wiccan holidays etc., The problem was that at some point it started to be boring, it starts to be all about Herbalism - with charts and lists.If you are interested in Herbalism - this is a good book for starting off.It didn't live up to it's title."
5,Great service and great fit.,The shoes were delivered as stated and felt as good on me as they looked in the photo. Great
4,Great for kids older than 1 1/2,"I enjoy reading this book to my daughter. I thought I would try to see if I could catch her interest. She is almost a 1 1/2 years old, but she enjoys the pictures. Its a little too much for her right now, because she can't do the hand signs, but it's never to early to flame a child's learning ability."
5,Good book,Got this for my daughter and she loved it. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner.
3,the book on sign language was not what i expected.,"i was disappointed in the book that i purchased. i wanted a book for a little baby who could do the first little signs like milk and water. i got the idea from the move the fouckers, the baby who signed for milk. the sign for milk was not even in ths book that i purchased. i should have been more careful in what i was buying."
5,wonderful sign book for kids,"This is a really good, cute book for little kids. It doesn't have tons of signs but it is a fun way to learn the alphabet and a few signs for each letter."
5,great first signing book,"We have used this bood with my granddaughter since she was about 10 months old. She is 2 now. She loves looking and identifying the pictures and consistently uses several signs. It was really helped to avoid meltdowns when she wants milk,etc. because she could sign the words before she could speak them."
3,Good book...if this is what you want!,"I gave this as a gift and I was expecting it to be something different than what it was. It's really just like a concordence for the bible, organized a bit different and with more unique headings. It does require a Bible, however, if you want to read the passages as they relate to a particular item.If you're looking for a great gift for someone who's a minister or a devote of the bible, it's the perfect gift. It's also ideal for that person who likes to ""debate"" over dinner with friends about what's real according to the bible (e.g., the second law of thermodynamics concerning energy deterioration: Ps. 102:26, Rom. 8:18-23, Heb. 1:10-12).The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I do feel that it wasn't properly represented, If Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature had been offered on this item, I WOULD NOT have purchased it."
4,NOTE: 'Vinyl' is very different from the traditional Duck Tape Material,Make sure you want the Vinyl tape. It is not as strong or durable as traditional Duck Tape.
2,vinyl duct tape,maybe because it is vinyl - but this is not like regular duct tape - this does not stick very good - but I needed black and did not have many options
1,Read description carefully,"This is 3M #3903 duct tape. This tape is manufactured in Taiwan.The tape's 3M label is clearly marked as being ""LOW-MEDIUM ADHESION"".The tape is rated by the 3M company as ""LO STRENGTH for ADHESION"".The tape is rated by the 3M company as ""VERY LOW BACKING STRENGTH"".I should have researched this tape on-line.... instead, I read the part of the product description that read ""Typical physical and performance properties include; adhesion to steel"" AND ""Highest tensile strength for highest demanding jobs"".Unless you are already familiar with a products specifications.... read up on the SPECS before buying an item for the first time. My mistake, so I cannot in all honesty return the tape.... so now I have an expensive roll of masking tape for painting???"
1,key word: vinyl,This is not what the average person thinks of when they think of duct tape. This is garbage that just doesn't stick even in good conditions.
3,Not duct tape!,Although good quality 3M tape.... it's not Duct! The vinyl makes it weaker and more prone to come free. O.k. for black only apps. with moderate holding needs.
3,An unusual romance,"Evergreen is set in the 19th century and revolves around women's prison reform. Not your typical premise for historical romance. I wasn't quite prepared for this. However, in a genre with many ""done to death"" settings, this is interesting stuff, assuming you are expecting it.The romance takes a backset to the politics of this book. It didn't capture my attention.The book also has a moderate dose of Christian fundamentalist undertones which may be hard for some readers (like me) to handle.All the same, I can see why this book won a Reviewer's Choice award. It's a little bit like the Oscars. This is an original and different book. It may not be something you'll like but it deserves recognition for it's courage in trying to write of new and unusual themes."
5,Another excellent book in the series,"If you are reading this, I can imagine no recap is necessary for the series. This is another excellent installment of the Young Wizard series featuring all of our favorite characters. The ending with Kit and Ponch is very sweet and overall this was one of my favorite series growing up. However, if you are new to this series, I do not recommend getting this book as your first one. This series is nothing like Harry Potter and in many ways is superior to that series both in terms of its complexities as well as the subject matter and varied topics."
5,The YW series is great!,"So, I've been reading Diane Duane's book for a year or so and I really like them. I loved this one because old characters and new characters are meshed together. Plus, Carmela is really funny! The only thing with these books are...having patience to wait for the next book to come out. I've been waiting for a while for WoM. Yeah..."
3,Consequences are scary...,"This book was interesting, it explained well how we got where we are philosophically. It was crammed with forethought. Good read, it was dry, but it's philosophy, what do you expect?"
3,A mix up on difinitions,"Weaver's book, one of the foundations of the Conservative movement in the US, could have had a better title. After reading it, I thought a better title might beIdeas have Implications, Actions have Consequences.As to a foundation of Conservatism, it is easy to see, after reading this book, that Conservatism is rather shallow. As followers of Edmund Burke, they take the English, royalty and nobility position versus the French, Voltaire position of turning the government over to citizens."
2,Lets get back to the bad old days.,"Although this book does have some insightful criticism of our society, it is largely a justification for getting back to the bad old days. Just bring back realism and traditional religion and everything will be fine. No mention of past religious wars, inquisitions, rulers sacrificing their subjects for pointless conquests, slavery, the oppression of workers, women and children. Lets get rid of unions and the free press. The privileged and the wealthy will have their way and the rest of us will have to obey. Wonderful!"
5,Fulfilled Prophecies,"Professor Weaver, writing in the late 1940's, clearly analyzes the cultural trends of his day. Furthermore, he translates the form of those trends into the logical consequences they would embody if left unchecked. Read this book;you will find yourself pausing ever so often to ponder the current state of our culture, as it mirrors these words written over 50 years ago. His writing and style are clear and profound. I often would find myself trying to strectch my reading times because the ideas expressed were so compelling."
4,Conservatives think; socialists make noise,"A philosophical essay on the maladies suffered by modern man that cause him to behave and think more and more in uncivilized ways. The author exhibits an amazing wealth of culture and common sense over things that we -as used to faulty thinking as we are- took for granted.In very cultured (may I say dense) language he stirs our thinking towards first things, to how things were meant to be in the first place, to the origin of many of our stupid actions; this way we are helped to retrace our missteps. A question we should me making a lot through this book is ""what would you expect thinking like that"".If I missed a lot of what was implied in the dense indictment of Mr. Weaver it is mostly my fault, as it requires pause and rereading. No wonder this is a fundamental pillar of Conservative thought.The reason why we don't think straight, I would say, is because we allow it to be done by others. We reap what we sow."
5,Festive Cakes,"A very convenient cake pan, perfect for Halloween or any day during autumn. Very good value, high quality, nonstick pan. The cakes are so adorable, however when (and if) you frost the little pumpkin shaped cakes, you don't get to see the intricate details. So I recommend you use a very flavored cake batter such as marble cake so you don't need frosting, it also looks nicer when served this way. Nevertheless the shape still resembles a pumpkin even if you frost. I really recommend this pan, it is a great value and offers a fun shape cake that everyone will love. I also suggest the snowman and Santa pan's, those are good too."
5,Great product,This shelf is very well made & very easy to assemble.I would highly recommend it.It looks great & blends in well with the furniture.
3,A little rickety but does the job,"I have a 32"" HDTV and therefore got the 32"" turntable. I also bought the separatedly-sold vcr shelf that goes under the turntable. I should have gotten a much smaller turntable because my 32"" is on a stand so its footprint is actually much smaller than 32"". Now I have to return it and get the 20"", which is the smallest turntable that the vcr shelf will fit with. Also, the side pieces on the vcr shelf are wobbly. I tightened it as much as I could."
5,Great item,"This piece was purchased as an adjunct to the TV turntable--needed somewhere to store the DVR. At first I didn't think it was going to be easy to assemble, but I was very wrong. The total piece looks as if I spent a lot of money to provide a new piece of furniture just for my TV and DVR in my bedroom. I love it!"
5,Greatest diaper bag ever!!,"I purchased this product for my wife and 16 month old daughter. It has been a godsend for my wife. It is so convenient,lightweight but strong. It has so many easy to-get-to pockets and is comfortable to have on your shoulder. I will keep this thing forever(or at least until the 2nd child is born and then i'll give it away). A definite buy even if you have only one child. Having the double instead of the single makes a big difference."
5,Great diaper bag for multiples!,This bag is great for twins! It has many compartments inside and out and is very easy to keep organized. A great feature of the bag is that it can be hung on the handles of my Maclaren Twin Techno. I have received many compliments on this bag from other mothers who see it on my stroller. The camo is a great and fun pattern - especially for my 7 month old twin boys!
4,A fantastic work,"This work, Silence of Snakes, is an extremely well crafted piece of prose. Set in the North Carolina mountains early in the 20th century, the sense of place is incredibly strong and faithful to the land and the people. This is a beautiful combination of a study of mountain folk, the redemption of a drunken newspaper man, and a gruesome murder. Mr Green's voice is true and steady throughout the book and he does not disappoint. The story and the images will stay with you for a long time, like a disturbing, comforting, gritty echo of long ago."
1,Not very compatable,"I purchased this unit as a 'great idea for a laptop' especially since most of my new laptops come without a floppy. However, this unit did not work on any computer I tried it on. And if you read the user support forum you find several people waiting for answers on why it doesn't work.The tech guy suggested a driver upgrades and disabling devices to get the unit to work but other than messing up my machine the unit would not work. He suggested getting another unit since it must be a bad card reader but the second one responded the same - floppy works, but no card readers.So far two different explanations have been floated. One is that it doesn't work with XP Pro machines - which seems to jive with my experience and the second is that it is a USB 2 issue. One of my machines is a USB 1.1 and it didn't work there either.Bottom line - buy and try - make sure you can return the unit when it doesn't work on your machine."
4,A Wonderful Introduction to Psy-Trance,"A well laid out collection of trippy trance cuts, with few downfalls. The songs are not mixed, they simply end, and the last disc is best left unheard. For the remaining 3 discs, the tempo and energy combine to give anyone a very good sample of psy-trance. It has enormous replay value, and for the price, it really can't be beat. With the likes of Seti Project, M.O.S., Jerry Parsons, and Chris Organic, it is a solid start or addition to any trance collection."
2,Not for pre-schoolers,"While their music is great my grandkids (pre-schoolers) didn't really get into the DVD. If there were more animals, or kids enjoying the music (jumping or dancing around) it would have been more fun, but a lot of the DVD was just a ""live concert"" feel and didn't hold their attention. Perhap grade school kids would do better with it."
5,Redbirds: Memories from the South,"Redbirds, as all of Rick Bragg's work, is hard to put down. Rick Bragg lives life, sometimes wildly, as all his family does, but has fun with it.He has become my favorite writer and I ordered everything he wrote from Amazon.com. I've almost finished all but one.Maybe it is his ancestry that I seem to share. He uses words like ""rurnt"" which I've heard older family members use, as well as ""Ava's Man"". My grandmother referred to her sons-in-law like that."
1,Redbirds: Memoirs of the south...,"I just wanted to know where it is???I have ordered books on line before through Amazon, but this seems a little extreme to not have received it yet. Christmas is over, as is the New year and Valentines' day is fastly approaching! If I were to order another book on line I am seriously thinking about not going through this vendor, this is not typical service. This vendor, I feel, needs to be evaluated. Thank you and I do look forward to getting this ""present""."
1,Inaccurate Omega--especially for the price,This Omega watch is beautiful to see but not accurate on time keeping. This may be because of the self-winding property but it was losing 20 seconds a day which I find unacceptable in an Omega watch. My old 14-year old Omega seldom lost 4 or 5 seconds a month. I returned the new Omega because it far exceeded the guaranteed accuracy.
3,WBL Artists,Lulu Belle & Scotty first appeared on the old WLS National Barndance and were fixtures there for many years. These recordings are from the old Starday cuts they did in the mid 1960s. It's not bad but not up to snuff as the original 78s they cut in their prime. At one time there was a CD available through some obsure source which included most of the better 78 cuts. Scotty penned a lot of the songs the duo sung. His most famous composition was Have I Told You Lately That I Love You. The Lulu Belle & Scotty arrangement never made the charts but the Bing Crosby/Andrews Sisters cut turned into gold.
5,Excellent condensation of an often misunderstood theory,"Hinshelwood provides the clinician with an important synopsis of Mrs. Klein's approach to the understanding of the patient's unconscious. His digestion and presentation of her theory of the development of the mind and symbol representation enables even the neophyte analyst a wonderful insight into the world of Klienian theory. Rather than assuming the reader is well-versed in the terms of Klienian theory, he provides a easy to read primer of her concepts of the development of the mind. In addition, one would profit from this tome if reading other challenging authors such as Bion who assumes his reader is conversant in Kleinian theory."
4,"Excellent quality, easy to assemble, good looking.","Didn't give it 5 stars because cable cover is difficult to set-up and snaps out easily. Ended up leaving my stand without the cable cover, but cables are against the wall, where nobody sees them. I strongly recommend this stand to anyone who would like an open stand for an A/V system."
2,Was expecting better,"I just got my new Zefal Air Flash Pump. Initially, it looks good and mounts as expected. However, as I had gotten several CO2 cartridges, I decided to test it out. The 16g cartridge is way too big to store in the pump as advertised. The base of the pump can only engage a few threads before it punctures the cartridge. So if you want to store an unpunctured 16g cartridge, you run the risk of the pump coming apart while you're riding. Second, as soon as the cartidge was punctured, it started to leak inside the pump. You'd need to be ready to use it right away and you still won't get all the gas into the tube. Last, when I took it apart, the seal had moved and covered the punch such that without tools, it would have been useless if needed for a second cartridge. Overall, very disappointing. Then again, what do you expect for under $20. You get what you pay for."
5,Read as a Child,I read this book as a girl and I was very sad when the library took it out of circulation because of damage. I decided on a whim to check and see if I could find it on Amazon. I found it and ordered it right away. I love this book!!!
4,Insightful and interesting to hear first hand about Whitman,"Whitman, Ginsberg and Dylan are three of America's greatest offsprings. And while Ginsberg and Dylan are of our times and can be appreciated in the here and now, and nicely preserved thanks to modern technology, Whitman remains in a time that seems more and more distant as America changes, what seems, hour by hour. Whitman, that great poet (Leaves Of Grass) and humanitarian (his efforts to comfort soldiers injured during the Civil War) was a great inspiration to this kindred and sophisticated spirit from England, Edward Carpenter (also a poet). Carpenter offers some of the most insightful and poetic glimpses into this giant of a man. You can almost see Whitman's reflection in the mirror Carpenter holds before you. This little book is a must for anyone interested in Whitman, and what WW was really about."
4,Great Information- Keep it Handy!,This has been a great book for referencing all different types of literary criticism. It is easy to read and comprehensible; this book is something I will keep with me as I go into my Master's English Program. Highly recomended for those who like clear cut information on literary criticism.
1,Exceeded shipping estimate date,"The shipping estimate was Sep21 - Oct14, book showed up on Oct 21. Since this is a new text for a newly started online class. I was late submitting my paper on literary analysis paper."
5,Works perfectly!,"This really makes watching TV easy. Our large, very heavy TV can be turned with no effort for watching in different parts of the room. The price was a little high, but if you need to adjust your large TV, this is the only way to go!"
5,A fine product,This item fits together with the bottom portion to make a completeturntable and it is a wonder that they are not combined originally.
5,Great product,Better than I expected- nice and sleek design. Really fast service!! Black finish blends great with the black finish on our new TV. Would definitely order this product again.
3,"Functional, but the 27 inch would have been better","A few years ago, I purchased the Sanus 27 inch turntable for my 27 inch TV. I was happy with the product. Now, I needed a turntable for a 32 inch TV (NOT flatscreen) since we were moving to a new house, and we wanted to protect our entertainment center surface from scratches. I debated over the sizes, but finally ordered the 32, thinking to match it to the TV size. When I opened the box, the front corner of the turntable was scratched and marred, despite the styrofoam packing. Too big an item to fool with returning it. I think that it's a bit oversized for our TV, and wish that I had ordered the smaller size. OTOH, we will eventually move up to a flat screen, so maybe the 32 inch base will make more sense, then."
4,Great buy......one small flaw,"Overall, this is exactly what I was looking for. It works great, swivels smoothly and it's just the right size. Unfortunately, it suffered delivery damage. It was gouged through the thin cardboard box it was packaged in - a small 1/4"" gouge in the most visable spot (center on the front edge). A black magic marker helped to make that less noticeable. I use this at work to support 2 side-by-side computer monitors and it does the job. I would recommend this to anyone - worth the price."
1,Inacuracies Spoil Substance,"While a worthy topic, the incredible number of inacuracies (e.g., in the same paragraph, both Jeff Fell and Jacinto Vasquez were listed as the rider of Pleasant Colony in the '81 KY Derby. Nevermind that the rider was actually Jorge Velasquez...) make the book a frustrating and difficult read. The author also repeatedly calls colts ""she."" Wayne Lukas is a very complex figure, both loved and scorned. His tale deserves to be told, but it should be done much better than this."
2,This book breaks slow and never recovers,"Inaccuracies aside and there are a lot of them (Northern Dancer being referred to as Native Dancer, etc.) This book is poorly written, nonlinear storytelling being a major fault. The author jumps back in forth in time when discussing horses and races. There also is nothing really new revealed in this book as it's mostly a rehash of already well published facts. Finally it doesn't help that Wayne comes off as humorless and unsympathetic here as he does in real life."
1,Outran--Absolute Glue,"A true shame. What purports to be a definitive biography is mostly a paraphrase of several articles and passages from other books.No trainer in this lifetime influenced the Sport of Kings more than D. Wayne Lukas. His story deserves the treatment of a quality writer and editor. However, the team that conditioned this offering either lacked those qualities (which I honestly doubt), or they simply didn't care to get it right. The book is filled with inaccuracies and misspellings. It is disjointed and frustrating to read.Readers will find themselves constantly composing a letter to the publisher in their mind. If you are thinking of purchasing this book, wait for the softcover. Instead try Joe Drape's recent account of the triple crown series or try to find Sports Illustrated articles about Lukas.Specious at best."
1,As entertaining as a soap opera,Save your money...This book isn't worth the paper in which it is written.
3,Functional but........,This short patch cable is functional and works as intended. But would it have killed the manufacturer to use a heavier gauge wire? It feels cheap in your hands because the wire gauge (diameter)is so small. Probably no line loss due to shortness of the cable. Plugs are large and easy to grasp. Just can't get over the small diameter of the cable.
2,Poor Quality,This was the shortest male to male cable I could find. The cord is very VERY thin and the quality is terrible. It's unusable.
2,1 out of 2 works..,"I ordered 2 of these.. one of them worked, the other did not. I did not return the item. I bought it for use is car and the performance is as expected."
1,Poor quality,I bought four of these little cables since they're so useful. All four of them have poor connections that require you to fiddle with them to get sound.
1,Don't do it,Ive only had this cord for 30 days and already doesn't work. It has come apart at the end of the cord going into the plug. It lives in my car and is almost never touched so I don't think over use is the issue but just a poorly made product. It worked great for the first 30 days though.
2,Poor connection,"Works OK, but the connection is poor. Any slight wiggle causes the right channel to fluctuate. A firm press back into the jack combined with a careful removal of my hand causes it to work well until the next time it is wiggled.I have a number of other cords that work much more reliably with the same devices."
1,Also bad connection,I had the same problem as some other reviewers. The cable worked fine for a few weeks and now the cable will not work unless you bend it and play with it to make contact. It is past the time I can return it. It was cheap so not a big deal but it is either a bad run or just a cheaply made product.
3,Too Short,"The cable works just fine, but is only five inches instead of the twelve inches needed to connect my components."
3,Does the job,"This is an extremely low priced cord, and it gets the sound from point a to point b. There is some static if you move either device or touch the cable. There is also some interference. Not an option for fans of high fidelity, but if all you need to do is get sound from your mp3 to a cheap broadcast port, this will do the job on budget."
3,Not a bad cable - however not 1 foot in length,"Does the job, but a lot of suppliers here cut corners in length. This is 9 inches long, not 12 inches (a foot). I had very specific measurements for a system I wanted this tied to.Its not that I feel cheated by 3 inches, just that the cable is short and pulls everytime I hook my component.Why not say 9 inches instead of a Foot ?"
1,Crackles from the first moment you use it.,Used it for about 10 minutes and threw it in the trash. Guess I'll go to Radio Shack and get something that at least works.
1,Failed quickly,"One of the connections where the cable meets the plug failed after a month of light use in the car, resulting in the right channel cutting in and out. This is not a reliable product."
3,"Good, but short","I can't complain about it, given the fact that the size is quite well specified in the description of the product.So, what can I say? Is it good? Yes.. but it is very short!!!"
3,"Well, they worked...a little too well.","I had these applied at my local 'pet store'. My cat had been scratching my hardwood floors when he ran away from things (he was born feral). Cutting his claws didn't help, because they were still sharp enough to scratch the floor. I had these put on twice. The first time, they worked well. The second time, he got the ones off his back claws in a couple of days (those were the claws we were worried about). Over 2 months later, the ones in front are still there! He can't get them off, I guess his claws haven't shed, and we can't get them off! We keep cutting at them as his nails grow, hoping that they will just grow off. In the meantime, he makes clicking noises everywhere he walks. I can't imagine that it's comfortable, but it doesn't bother him enough to actually chew them off. I don't know. I just decided to refinish my floors with something more durable, so I don't know if we will try these again."
2,To each cat her own,They're very easy to use and keeps them from scratching and the cat doesn't seem bothered...at first. but after a few days my cat started hiding again because she didn't feel safe anymore since she couldn't scratch. The glue is extremely strong and difficult to remove.
5,my favorite color for these nail caps,love this color for my cats. My cats love it too. The nail cap arrived on time it was a very fast delivery. my cats love them too.
2,they don't stay on,I used these after getting new furniture however my cat has figured out how to get them off. So now I guess I'm going to have her declawed. Which I really didn't want to do.
5,Wonderful alternative to declawing,"This product is a GREAT alternative to declawing. They are easy to put on (if your cat struggles, wrap them in a towel with only their head and foot you're working on sticking out) and last for weeks and weeks before falling off. The colors are great too. One word of caution: the glue will instantly bond skin like superglue."
3,Works fairly well,"Works fairly well, just could use a few extra glue adapters for the times when you only need to replace a couple in between the full replacement times. One of our cats is fairly laid back and it's really easy to install the other you have to sit on and have someone help you install."
3,"If you can get them on properly, they're okay","My cat won't chill out long enough for me to properly get these on. I've had 3 different people try but she freaks out. When we finally manged to get 8 of them on they fell off fast. I think the longest that one of them lasted was about 3 weeks. The other 7 were off anywhere from a few hours to a few days. I don't know if it's due to how hard it was to get them on, or a product issue though. My parents have had some for their cats (different brand) and they lasted a lot longer than these, even when their cats wouldn't sit still."
2,Not that impressed...,"I have tried so many different self tanners and I was hoping that this product would be the one that I stuck with. Not so!! I will admit the product has a great scent, but that's about all it has. I followed the directions and I still don't know why this product has such high rating. I exfoliated, moisturized and then waited about two hours to let that set. I decided to use the product before I went to bed. I used gloves, started at my feet, and worked upwards. I let it dry for about two hours before putting on loose clothing. When I showered in the morning ALL the color went down the drain. I was as pale as I was before I used this product. I tried using this again the following night and in the morning after showering I was very spotty. I had to use an exfoliator to get rid of the spots. I must stress that this product is NOT good for the FACE and NECK !!! SPOTS...SPOTS...SPOTS !! Not only does the product go down the drain when showering, but so does the money spent."
2,"Goes on blackish/greenish, leaves uneven tan.","I have fair skin/light eyes and hair. I've been using sunless tanners for years. I really don't care for this product. You cannot put it on and go out the same evening, because it has an odd odor and goes on with a black/greenish tint (which you must wash off in the shower). It's true that you don't look orange, which is why I didn't give it a one star; but for me the resultant tan is splotchy at best. It seems like my hair folicles get dark and the rest of my legs are still light. Not going to purchase again."
1,Sun self tanning lotion ultra dark,I bought the sun self tanning lotion ultra dark and i didnt like it because once i put it on yes i got darker but the next day when i shower it all came off in the water and on my towel. It does make you dark though so thats good i just was looking for something that would stay on better.
5,Great Self Tanner,this is one of my favorite self tanning lotions its instant tan & also over night darkens more this comes out bronze so you have no problems seeing where your applying it it also gives my face a glow it has like a shiny glow to the face when applyed to your face i love this product its so resonably priced & you get a nice amount of product the tan lasts a week & gradually goes away doesnt lok blotchy & iccky as it fades it just gets lighter & lighter like your just loosing a real tan & has a nice smell not a yucky self tanner smell you can also chhose from light to meduium to dark i like the dark but everyone has to pick the shade that suits them the best :)
3,Average,"The application is smooth and the smell is decent.. at first. I allow for the lotion to set for 3 hours before washing it off. It smells great in the bottle; however, after 3 hours, I smell like I just got out the tanning bed. It does give me great color though (I'm very fair skinned). The only problem I have when I apply it is my hands and ankles looking orange. It turns orange when it wears off bc all the movement throughtout the day. I stopped using it bc I could never figure out how to apply this product without my hands looking orangey. I cant seem to wear a watch either. One day I wore a watch when it was hot out and the sweat took the color right off. It looked like I was on vacation in the sun and never took my watch off. I hope this product is working out for you guys a little bit better than it did for me. :("
2,Great at first,"Loved it at first after my 3rd application the color faded then did nothing. Tried it again this year did nothing. I bought 3 more bottles, because of the way it worked at first. My skin info pale do not tan burn, so really wanted this to work for me. Gonna try million dollar tan now."
5,Sun self VS fake bake!,"First let me say I like both products very much. But to compare the two - both smell really good but I like the smell of sun self better! It smells like cherry while the other smells like coconut.. Application- I think fake bake is easier to apply, but I think you have to use more of the fake bake product to get the same deep dark color as sun self. Sun self you definitely don't have to use as much so that means you have to buy it less often! Both of the color results are beautiful, but sun self is sooo deep and so natural looking so as far as color goes they are almost even but sun self just looks so much deeper. It takes longer for me to get sun self on though, I don't like that. Sun self takes me about 25 min to get it all rubbed in and even. Fake bake takes maybe 10 min. Either way you can't go wrong - just be careful with the sun self, could easily be streaky, while fake bake is goof proof ( so easy it's unbelievable )"
1,Orange color and sticky feeling,"I have natural olive skin. This product makes my skin orange and with a sticky like feeling the whole day. I apply it during the day (it's smelly and my husband doesnt like it), so it is pretty uncomfortable. It also stains clothes. I don't like it and don't recommend it."
2,Streaked and uneven,"I was tanning using a bed and sadly, my legs didn't tan as deeply as the rest of me was and so I bought this product based on reviews. This product sucked! It did not go on evenly and dried so fast that as I was applying it that there were streaks. I still have over a half of a bottle of this and it is going in the trash. The color isn't too bad, but I will try another product next time I self tan where I need to. Also, don'y get it near your hands or feet or you will look like an oompah-looompah."
4,Dark Tan,"This tanning lotion does smell good and it will get you really dark BUT you must wear gloves when applying it. I have never had a tanner get me as dark as this did, but I had to purchase latex gloves to apply it and be very careful what I wore while it was on."
5,Never try anything else,"This stuff gives you the most beautiful tan ever. I am very fair and like to look like I am alive, especially during the summer. I just exfoliate in the shower prior to using it, then rub it all over. I wait about five minutes to dry and apply a moisturizer over it to seal it in. The color last about 3-4 days. I always get a bunch of compliments whenever I use it. Sometimes during the winter, I will use it under my makeup just to give my skin a little bit of a healthy glow."
5,LOVE IT!,"I am pasty pale and have a HORRIBLE time with streaking but i have to have a tan i live in ARIZONA for goodnes sakes lol... I've tried St. Tropez, XENtan, jergens and a bunch others which were just not working for me...BUUUUTTTT...I use this product with a self tanning mitt and it gives FLAWLESS results. It serously is not orange... more of a brownish green if anything. Its a beautiful color. I promise. The smell is good, i personally dont like cherry and almond but it doesnt last and like i said its ok... better than that stinky self tanner smell.I use it along with the Amir Touch of tan lotion and omg i have the best tan ever. ORDER THIS STUFF!!! :)"
4,nice tan hard to apply evenly,This product will give you a nice color but it is very esy to leave streaks. Even when completely dry to the touch will come off on fabric. applying at night before bed use dark sheets. Color washes offin the shower but leaves behind a nice tan. I would purchase again until I find something I like beter.
2,Dark tint from color guide but no developed tan,"I liked how it looked when I first applied it, but once you wash off the color guide, there really seemed to be very little actual tan there. I am extremely white but I can get some color from other brands. I was really hopeful about this one but it was not worth the money at all."
1,Ultra dark my ass,This is no comparison to fake bake. Can't believe they actually call this ultra dark cause it barely took me down one shade.
1,SHIPPING IS RIDICULOUS,I ordered this item on March 10 and I'm still waiting for it to be shipped to me(March 27). This is a great product but I will not be ordering it from the same place.
4,great,"product worked really well, took a little long to dry. Smells great when you first apply it but a few hours later it smells like classic self tanner. other then that it gave me a great tan!"
1,Could be better,I found that it when on uneven and the color is okay but not great. Will not be purchasing again.
4,sun in a bottle,"I am new to sunless tanners but not to beauty products in general in addition to aesthetics. In fact, I have only really tried two sunless tanners: commodyne wipes, and this. i am pale, pale pale mostly and the color of this looked fine, the only reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the clump factor. however, i would not recommend this for an ""amateur"" so to speak, simply because it is so messy and the color so dramatic- but the color is fantastic, not orange but rather seems to have a more green base."
1,Big Orange With Arms and Legs,"This product was such a let down. I have been using self tanners for over 9 years and consider myself to be very good at the application process. This product was an absolute horror to apply. Its very thick and soaks in so rapidly that it looks streaky. The more you attempt to fix it the more streaky it becomes. I applied mine at night and let it dry with faith that the streaks I was seeing with the color guide would not reflect in my end tan. When I woke up the next morning I was fairly suprised at how evenly tan I looked. Then I took a shower. Now I just look like a big orange with arms and legs who stinks of self tanner. What a horror! I am still a fan of Loreal's Sublime Bronze. Its literally $7 and is the BEST self tanner I have found to date. Save your money, unless you want to look like you were born in a Florida orange grove."
2,Average,"I have tried several other products and tried this because of great reviews. I feel this product was average. I was not happy at how fast the product dried, making it extremely hard to blend. I was real blotchy and uneven even after showering, shaving, exfoliating and moisturizing right before application. It did look natural and NOT orange the next morning. It was harder to blend around the knees, elbows, ankles and feet than my favorite kind. Product fades extremely uneven and then looks very unnatural. Even with the fast drying, there was still the same amount on my pajamas and sheets as the slower drying products. I did apply at night and showered in the morning with the same amount of runoff as the other product I currently use. I even loaned the product out to a family memeber to see how she liked it. She felt the same as I did; very natural looking but streaky, hard to blend and faded very uneven."
1,Not What I Expected...,"I bought this tanning lotion the other day and tried it for the first time today. I was so excited to try it because of all the good reviews, but I have to say I'm not impressed. It did give me a lot of color, but the color was more orange than anything. When my family saw me they all asked me what the heck I did to my face...not quite the response you want to hear when you use a tanning lotion. And yes it does smell good (at the beginning), but honestly I'd rather have a self tanner that smells bad and works than one that smells nice and turns me orange. Anyways, I'm going to stick to my Tomas Tanning lotion from Salley's; it smells bad but it works."
3,It's an ok alternative to tanning,"I am VERY pale and I got this product to try out sunless tanning again! I have tried other product before but I end up looking orange! I read great reviews and I was super excited to get this! Once I got it, I don't know if I expected too much but the tan I got doesn't look as natural as I would like it to. I don't look orange (unless I over-apply) I have to be very careful on how I apply it or else it might not look even. The color looks super dark on my ankles which screams out SUNLEES TANNER!!! Maybe I just need a lighter tanning lotion? Otherwise,it's an ok alternative to tanning. I might have to keep looking though if I want to look more natural!"
3,not what expecting,"There is little to no smell with this stuff, which is great, however the color seems to just wash off in the shower. i am a fair skinned red-head so I expected this stuff to be almost too dark for me. But it isn't. It is annoyingly light. won't buy again but will finish off the bottle to see if it grows on me."
4,Has made a difference,"I have white spots on my face (no pigmentation), so I bought this product on my dermatologist's recommendation and was pleasantly surprised as to what a difference it has made on my appearance. My face looks a lot more normal and the white spots are not as obvious. Very easy to use this product and it blends well with your skin. Just make sure you rub it and spread it evenly. Better than the other brands I've tried."
5,great product!,This self tanning lotion is great! I have very fair skin and this darkens my skin within one application. Excellent product - worth the money spent!
5,excellent self tanner,"When you want a tanning lotion that does not streak or make you ""orange"" then this product is for you. My son has been using this now for at least 8 years and continually uses it.............highly recommended ."
5,"Better than ""Regular"" Brushes","Preserve Toothbrush, Soft / B000MUDJBUI bought these toothbrushes because they were made of recycled plastic, and I feel enough guilt over the state of the planet as is, without having to stress over toothbrush purchases. What I did not expect, however, is that I would end up liking these brushes better than the ones I was using.I was concerned when I saw the curved shape of the toothbrush, but within seconds of using the brush for the first time, I felt that the brush was easier to hold and use than the straight brushes I've used all my life. I was amazed at how quickly my fingers adapted to the new shape! The bristles are also wonderfully soft, perfect for my sensitive gums. Brushing is now less painful and more efficient, and it is easier to reach my back teeth with the curved handle.All that and I feel slightly less guilty about my toothbrush. And I don't have to drive all the way to the store to pick these up! I couldn't be happier with these brushes.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,"awkward shape, glad its good for environment",The design of this toothbrush was a little awkward to me. I guess its subjective but never feels exactly right. The angle is wrong for the way I am used to brushing my teeth. The case is nice and doubles as a travel case so don't throw it away. The bristles are fine. The toothbrushes come with a mailer so you can mail them in when you're finished with them. Thus completing the recycle process.
5,Excellent toothbrushes,Great toothbrushes that are recycled plastic. Lots of color. Soft gentle bristles for sensitive teeth and gums. Another plus: they fit in my toothbrush holder. The heads aren't too big so you can maneuver them easily
4,Great eco-friendly toothbrush!,"Love the concept of using the yogurt cups to make these toothbrushes. The curves of the brush is not too much of my favorite, and I prefer other conventional toothbrushes better, but rather than the unique curve, they are good and also to know that you are using recycled products, they are worth it."
3,Cruelty-free but doesn't hold up to wear,"I purchased this 6-pack of toothbrushes as I am trying to phase out my household cleaners, etc. and replace them with items from cruelty-free companies...the fact that these brushes are made from recycled yogurt cups was an added bonus. I have been using one of the brushes for about 3 weeks and the bristles began falling out last week while brushing and I've almost swallowed them. I was extremely disappointed as a standard toothbrush should last 2-3 months. I believe I will be looking for a different brand of cruelty-free brushes moving forward."
4,Easy to Read; Helpful Exercises,"I got this book for my Semantics and Pragmatics graduate course. It was easy to read and had helpful exercises at the end of each unit. We used this book mostly for the semantics; the progression of units through this topic was logical, and no doubt, the units buld off of one another. For pragmatics, we used Doing Pragmatics by Grundy (which is also a nice book), so I can't say much about that portion, but I would imagine it is similar to the semantics part.The book itself is small and easy to carry to class or the library."
5,A real pageturner...,"I had my reservations about the topic, but I must admit Sloan got me hooked from the start. It's a fast read, a definite pageturner. Looking forward to reading more from this new author!"
4,A Gripping and EngagingTale of Suspense,I stayed up all night reading this novel. It had me on the edge of my seat from the intriguing beginning all the way to the heart-stopping conclusion. I recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense!
3,"Overall, a good read","The book had me from the opening chapter. By the middle of the book, I was bored to tears, but then it began to pick up again, although slightly redundant, and pretty much predictable. I thought that the concept of the story was lame, but the way it's written will definitely get your attention.I'd reccommend."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"Yes, it is a must read.....I can't wait for her next novel. It takes the reader along for a ride that equals or surpasses a runaway freight train."
2,"Oh pleeeze! sophomoric, juvenile, bland. Shall I go on?","After reading the amazon reviews and being one who enjoys suspenseful novels, I bought the book.I should have bought lottery tickets. I've read 200 pages and don't think I can finish it. Was the author's brain soaking in syrup while writing this? Spare me the mother's high-horse, crap-don't-stink behavior. And Karen's childish dialogue becomes silly and laughable fast; serious in one breath, joking in the next. Please!The worst part about this story (there were many to choose from)is that the author relates nothing in the dialogue to allow the reader to know when events are taking place. had the beginning not been prefaced with ""dec. 1962"", there is no way of knowing that's where this begins. And this flaw does no justice whatsoever to teh conversations amongst the characters.Should I finish this book (doubtful), I may write a sequel to this review. But with so many books out there, I don't know..."
2,Did I miss something?!!,"After reading all of the glowing reviews, I thought maybe I had read a different book. I found the writing amateurish, the characters nothing more than stereotypes and the plot totally predictable. Not much of a thriller -- more of a snoozer.If you want to read good, well written legal thrillers by a women authors, I would recommend those written by Lisa Scottoline or Perry O'Schaughnessy."
4,Well worth reading,"I was delightfully surprised at the depth of characterization I found in this novel. Susan Sloan brings the characters off the pages and allows the reader to truly empathize. Those of us who were young through the sixties and seventies can understand the ""why"" of decisions made by them. The author is also able to draw a despicable antagonist. So many of us know someone with his attitudes or conscience. His fate is simply his ""just desserts."""
2,Paramount start... swooping end,"Albeit the book's first half is an excellent thrilling, as you start the second half the book is long-winded and boring. By the last quarter you won't find any thrilling plot at all. So you can choose better books than this one."
1,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear","I honestly cannot believe that the other reviews here are serious. I got this book for free and I still paid too much for it. I don't think I've ever read anything this cliched and embarrassing in all my life, and I read John Grisham books. The characters are puerile, one-dimensional and utterly stereotypical - there isn't an interesting soul among them. The dialogue is consistently irritating, and the pace makes an asthmatic sloth look like Carl Lewis! People, I implore you, do NOT listen to the other reviews of this book. Save yourself some money, and go and buy something really good. The only way you'll be able to read this is if you're desperately trying to avoid doing revision.(sic)Oh, and a final thought for Warner Books to put on the back of the next reprint - This book has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever."
3,Hand mitt,My only complaint is that I wish it would stay hot longer. I also use a sock filled with rice and that stays hot for quite a long time.
3,"A collection of jackie's best and worst, but a good bargain","This collection in my opinion is a great bargain at 55 bucks and is a must have for any jackie chan fan. Despite Fearless Hyena 2, To kill with intrigue, and new fist of fury are all pretty bad films. The great fearless hyena and the entertaing half of loaf of kung fu and spiritual kung fu make this collection worth buying for the avid jackie chan fan as jackie show off his trademark comedy/kungfu and charm."
3,Consider this,"The J. August Everything Pencil comes in about six colors. This makes sense. So why is it that the EraseZit Pencil comes in one color for everyone? My skin is very fair, so I wear the ultra-light Everything pencil which works well. However the EraseZit pencil made me look as though I had an orange blotch on my face no matter how well I blended. YUK. I suspect that it would blend well with medium toned skin. It also smelled clean and had a nice texture. I doubt that I would risk it on dark skin."
2,Dissapointing,"Billy Cobham is one of my favorite drummers, but unfortunately he wasn't the best speaker at the time he made this video. His speaking style is choppy and a bit long-winded. I was hoping for some lessons on how to do some of the things he does(beats, fills, etc.), but there really isn't much of that at all. It's really just Billy going on and on about things that aren't very interesting, and then playing a drum solo after every segment. Not worth the money at all."
4,Good tasting teas,"It took a while for me to receive them, I believe based on bad winter weather but they were worth the wait."
4,This video version is in widescreen?,"I saw this film ""The Sleeping Beauty"" with the Kirov ballet in 1968, opened in Mexico City in a superb 70mm widescreen print.whit full stereophonic sound. In one of those wonderfull movie palaces of the era. Months later was given a ""general release"" in 35mm monoaural but also in a 35mm widescreen CinemaScope versión. In this DVD version, in the ""production notes"" says tha the Aspec Ratio is 1.33-1. this means is a fullscreen cropend version of the film. Anyone can tellme if the DVD is in widescreen or not?"
1,NOT ready to use,Currently the amazon description says this is a 50/50 ready to use mixture. It is however the concentrate! 100% antifreeze so you'll have to mix it yourself!
5,Judy Garland and Liza are magical together!,"This was Judy's last concert at the London Pallidium and was Liza's first on-stage appearance (excluding TV). Although the B&W video quality is poor, the magic of the two on stage is excellent! If you are a fan of Judy or Liza, you owe it to yourself to add this tape to your collection - just seeing the love between Judy & Liza as they sing ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" is worth the purchase. And as another viewer writes, ""Over The Rainbow"" is magical. Yes, Judy's career was sadly coming to a bitter end and it comes through in this concert - but the audience stood and cheered as Judy closed the show with everything she had singing ""Chicago"" with Liza at her side. There was a special bond between these two wonderful ladies!"
3,"As usual, Judy gives what she can when live on stage.","I love to watch Judy work a room when doing a concert. Her natural wit and spontaneity are always entertaining. I have however seen her in better form. But Judy fans know her history and overlook it. I have never heard a audience so rude! I bought my copy on VHS. Other customers who bought DVD, is the quality any better?"
2,Sub-par tape quality matches sub-par Garland.,"Sadly, Judy is merely an echo of her former greatness in this concert with rising star Liza. Her vocal chords, irreparably damaged by this point in her stormy life, sound husky and over-medicated. Judy appears wan and tired, gets testy with the audience and down-right jealous of daughter Liza who sounds at times like a screeching cat. Abbreviated version of live Palladium concert include ballads not pulled from Judy's own songbag. Unsatisfying all-around."
1,Judy & Liza @ the Palladium,"I wish the listing had shown the date of release/performance!! Played it about halfway through, then trashed it - the worse recording I can remember hearing! Without the date, I had no way of telling that Judy was WAY PAST her prime in that she seemed to have almost no voice left. They both seemed very uncomfortable, and sort of bumbled along. Find something way earlier in her career."
4,Memoirs of Madame du Barri,"This book is not actually by Madame du Barri. It is edited (and probably written) by Lamothe-Langnon in the early 19th century. It is, however, a fascinating book. It recounts the intrigues and machinations of a court that plays at petty one up man's ship while the ship of state heads steadily for the rocks of destruction. The book is well written in the first person singular from an original written in the French. We see here a Madame du Barri as probably she was- a lover of pleasure, an easy spirit, jealous of her prerogatives and at constant war with Louis s family.I enjoyed this work- it helps to put a human face on those characters who too often end up on Olympian heights to be truly alive."
5,Death to ex girlfriends !!!!!,"I would kill to get hold of a copy of this! I lent mine to a girldfriend who never returned it.This is classic horror from the golden age. There Shall be no darkness is a great film waiting to be made Hollywood!Seriously, if you find it, get it and treasure itBarganax"
5,Guild Wars,This is a fun game for online play that does not cost to play. The graphics are cool and unique.
5,complex online role-playing,"great game, very flexible, a bit like diablo with bigger scale, much better graphics and a lot more flexibility. it doesn't cost to play online like others. you can either play by yourself or other peoples or hire computer gen char to play with."
4,Guild Wars Revisited,"All my nephews are on this game, and so I decided to plunk down some cash to see what all the fuss was about. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the graphics were better than anyting WOW has to offer, and there is good multi-player interaction. As others have written, it really is meant to be played with a group of like-minded cadres because there are situations where you cannot pass on your own (for example, a friend has to hold a gate open for you). This actually caused me to give it 3 stars for fun, since I grew up with games like Wizardry, Betrayal at Krondor, and Baldur's Gate that allowed me to adventure by myself. Still, for an older game, Guildwars is masterfully done and deserves praise. The only real addition that could be made is linking via headsets, if this hasn't already been incorporated."
5,Great RPG MMO - and NO fees!!!,This game definitely allows you to focus on battling and encourages that you link up with other players (uh...thus the title). You won't find yourself having to develop a trade skill before you can start adventuring like in some other MMOs. The interface is effective but simple enough so it doesn't clutter the screen. GW may not have as much variety in the character classes as other RPG MMOs but there is enough there for diversity.I can't believe how well done this game really is considering there are no monthly fees. That was the real reason I bought this game. Now I can see why every game site that has reviewed this game give it a great rating. You can't go wrong because of the fun factor of this game.
3,Excellent MMORPG,"If you love MMORPGs, then this is certainly the game for you. The player character is widely customizable and the gaming environment is massive in size.The reason I rated the game lower is because, unless you have a group of friends you always play with, you spend too much time trying to find a party to play with. Then, you can't always trust them not to leave you behind or share the loot.If gaming companies came out with a single player (with or without Net play available) RPG with the huge customizability of the player character and the massive size of the playing environment - well, I'd buy it."
5,MMPORG without the dweeb factor,"Guild Wars is the first of the MMORPG to eliminate most of my complaints about the form. First of all there is no monthly fee, a huge plus if you are like me and the ammount of time you have for playing any gien week veries greatly.Secondly the other issue I have with a lot of MMORPG is the other players, Guild wars stops a lot of the annoying behaviour of players from other games. When on a mission you only see players in your party, but you can see and interact with all the other players in towns & outposts. There is no stealing from other players and if you wish to fight other humans on line you can do so in the arena.There is a promise of more content modules being avilable in the future, but if you want to still play in the existing areas you will not be forced to buy the updates to play."
3,Average diablo like game.,"I went in to this game thinking it would be an amazing mmorpg. To my shock, it was very similar to Diablo, repetitive, and got old very quickly.Nothing ground breaking except for the no monthly fee part.""Crafting"" is as much as collecting items that you trade to someone. It kept my attention for about 2 weeks and then was uninstalled. I will say if you are looking for a mmorpg that will keep your attention for more then a few weeks this is not the game for you. I have played many different mmo games. Everquest, EQ2, WOW, City of Heroes, City of Villains and FFXI to name a few. I would say give one these games a try before buying Guild Wars. Many of them have free trials you can download from their sites."
3,Guild Wars,I haven't had much time to play this game.The scenery is beautiful but I think there could be more instructions for beginners.
2,Boring,"This game has great graphics, but it's very limited in functionality. A game that makes a fantasy world feel limited. That kind of says you're putting a limit on imagination. I'd say, try it out first from someone who may have it before you buy it because the person who used to live here in my room, a previous tenant, I heard from my roommates played the game a lot, so I guess he liked it."
4,"Impressive technology, but repetitious plot",The graphics of this game are very nice but I have found that play rapidly becomes repetitous. To reveal your code to unlock the game you have to rub off a protective gray coating on a card. My coating was defective and half of the text rubbed off with the gray coating. It took tech support a week to figure out my secret number before I could play the game.
3,It was fun for a while...,"This game had an interesting (though slightly predictable) storyline and relatively decent graphics (not as good as World of Warcraft). Some of the NPCs have tiresome dialogues that seem to ramble on forever. It's good that this game doesn't have a monthly fee to play because the levels go so quickly that you're left with nothing to do besides pvp afterward.For the price though, I'd have to recommend it if you're only interested in a quick amusement until something else comes out."
5,This has gotta be a great game!!!,"Guild Wars was recommended to me 2 weeks before launch by a friend. For now, all the Amazon reviews on this game state real highly about the game. RARELY does a game ever attract so many users to give positive feedback. This game is extremely fun, and it is my second day playing. It is absolutely a blast, its free which is even better, but as far as the game goes... leveling takes awhile. Even on level 3 which I am at right now, its very slow but its fun! The graphics are great, I've seen better in a different MMORPG called PristonTale. I believe they have the best graphics ever!! But this is Guild Wars we're talking about, sooo if your looking for a EXCELLENT game, and easy to understand game, I would definetly go for this game! Its a bit high in price, but its extremely fun.Additional info:- You can minimize the game!- NO lag whatsoever...- Broadband Connection recommended- You will have fun !!!"
3,Wow older game,I didn't remember even ordering this from here but it was a fun game and was free to play which made it even better.
4,great game,"This is a very interesting and fun game to play. But it's also very hard. The mobs tend to overpower the player even with the henchmen who never level unless you are in a different area ,which makes it very frustrating. Everytime the player dies, he has a dead penalty, the odds are not in favor of the player. But overall the game is great."
4,Guild Wars,"While most MMORPGs force the players to pay every single month, whether they are actually playing the game or not, Guild Wars does not force such a burden upon the player. For me, I am in college and thus do not have plenty of time to waste on a game, but small chunks of time. Guild Wars helps me out here in that I don't have to worry about my character in that I am paying big bucks to have him still be around, so I can take my time playing and enjoying the game instead of rushing through it to get my money's worth."
3,"Bells and whistles, not much community","The graphics are great, the fighting does take different strategies depending on the opponents, and strictly player versus player is a blast. The missions, both extraneous and storyline, are also easy to find and occasionally interesting. Unfortunately, because of the pvp emphasis and the no monthly charge this game is over-run with the l33tspeaking puberty-humor demographic. Good luck trying to role-play your character.The storyline is also less fun because everyone is just out there to 'unlock' skills and items for pvp anyway. Few care what the script is, and in joining a random multiplayer group you can be sure the plot will be summarized as 'go here, kill stuff, return asap'.Another thing about this game is that unless you're in a top guild, there's not much of a way to leave a lasting legacy or make an impact on the game world the same way there is in Star Wars Galaxies or EVE online. So if that's how you get your jollies look elsewhere."
5,Awesome!,This game is like a never-ending mystical adventure!And it's FREE to go online! I recommend all the ultimate gamers out there to get this game.
5,A great game,Guild Wars is a great game for people who like all out fighting and roleplaying. And if you like games with swords and shields this game has more like magic and much more. Another thing is you get to make a guild or join one and do guild battles. Go to [...]for more info about this awsome game.
2,Another honest review,"My views on games are always fair so I say this to be completely firm and honest.Don't buy this game unless you aren't looking for a MMORPG.This clearly isn't one. When I tried it out, I wasn't impressed. It was boring. The limited cities. Only encounting other players IN cities. No feel for real growth in my character. No real endgame or set purpose in leveling. Again, this may be good for a quick log on and play but I wasn't even remotedly impressed overall.Now the graphics are really nice but unless you are seeking a arcade type game. So Id have to say, all the other reviewers are blowing this up more than it is. I found it not fun and rather boring."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"Do not purchase this game,you will be dissapointed. The manufacturer of this game is CONSTANTLY changeing the abilities of characters and strategy of play. For example,you may aquire an item or skill for your character,after MANY HOURS of play,just to find that skill has been significantly changed,(weakened) the day after you aquired it. Basically,the company is in what appears to be a constant state of ""UPDATEING"". Unfortunately,the updates consistantly make your characters weaker,and the game ""monsters"" stronger. The company calls it ""skill Balanceing""..LOL..what a joke. NOT FUN. pick up a copy of diablo 2 or any other online game if your lookin for fun. This game is about as much fun as playin chess,and about as exciting as chess.OH,by the way,u ""must"" play this game online,there is no other way to play it. no stand alone version. and u must play as part of a group,u will die rather quickly trying to play solo."
1,fun for a while... then CRASH!,"I bought the game with great expecations, and it lived up to them.... however, once I got about 1/3 the way into it... My computer crashed and restarted at the exact same point in a level. Drivers are up to date, neither my cpu nor vid card are getting hot. Apparently this is only a problem with some people, and the makers arent doing anything about it. Kinda like the awful netcode for command and conquer generals... an awesome game.. but crappy customer service."
1,What's wrong with you people?,"I have played this game and I have also played World of Warcraft. This game is a horrible attempt at creating an MMORPG. My reasons are the environment and adventure part. This game fails in doing the one thing I play MMORPGs for... to be able to interact with people. In real life, when I walk out of a city all of the people will not have dissappeared from the face of the earth and then reappear when I go in the city again. This concept is flawed and creates a boring game. If you can't find a group, then you are screwed. There is a limited amount of player interaction outside of cities, unless they are in your group. The overall concept of this game is just plain flawed."
1,GREAT IF YOU DONT HAVE A NETGEAR ROUTER,This game is incompatible with many netgear routers. since its an open pc game i had to fight to get my money back. they didnt post it on the box so i didnt know. they make you spend your money then say OOOPS WE DONT SUPPORT YOUR ROUTER!!!
1,at least there's no subscription,"this chapter of guild wars is poorly done. they have focused on trying to push you into pvp play by making the pve very, very difficult, you no longer earn skills by doing quests, and the hunts are almost impossible, especially if you like to hunt solo, ie farming.another thing I didn't care for was how you had to search to even find where to do your quests. yes, the npc's have the exclamation mark above their head, but finding them has turned into a chore. I guess they've decided if they make your work hard to earn your fun, you'll appreciate it more.I would've guessed they could have made so much more out of this game. I mean, they sold over 2 million copies of the game retail when it first came out, I'd bet they sold half that of the following 2 expansions combined"
1,I feel bad for spending $50..,"This game is so BORING! The interface just plain sucks. I've only played one other MMORPG, and that's World of Warcraft. It's $15/month to play, and a friend told me to try Guild Wars since it's free. Well, I can honestly say, you get what you pay for. There are very few pluses: Well, obviously, it's free, the graphics are nice, and you don't spend a lot of time travelling. It lacks content and personality though. The characters are completely flat, and it's just not entertaining at all. I guess I've been spoiled by WoW and must be biased towards traditional MMORPG's."
5,THE BEST,"Guild wars is the best game i have ever played.The only regret that i have is that i did not get the premier collectors addition!I really think that guild wars is very well put together and playable and the fact that it is free to play is bonus!I only wish that i had more time to play, but i guess it is not feezable to quit my job so i could devote more time to play so will have to play when i can. lolThere are just not enough hours in the day."
5,Guild Wars,"I t is an excelllent game fun to play and pretty easy to work with, I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys stratedgy/rol/playing games."
5,Awesome,"This game is worth your time and money. It has numerous quests for you to complete, with or without other players, plus it has an amazing pvp (player versus player) mode to go along with them. This game is great for short, quick plays, and it's also great for long play-sessions that last into hours of the morning that you didn't even think were real. (Like 4 A.M., since when is that an actual time??) There are a few shortcomings, such as the little amount of customization and crafting. However, the fact that this is a one-time buy, that's right, there are no monthly fees, evens this out. All in all, this is a game for mmorpg lovers and single-player-rpg lovers to spend time on. Also, as stated by another, DO NOT buy this game used, because the game is fully installed, and you can play without the disk. So, somebody could sell you their used copy, and then keep playing, while at the same time, you would be at a $40 loss. Buy it new, and have fun!"
5,Game comparable to World of Warcraft,"This game is very good with its graphics. Better, in my opinion, than WOW or DAOC. But a lot of repitition in killing monsters and limited in quests for the beginning part of the game. You have to go into the more dificult second sequence of the game to find any good quests and items to use for your character. Upgrades for your charcter are hard to find and without help from other players, are nearly impossible to find. Other than that, it keeps you on your toes in excitement and fun."
4,Free online and great fun,"First of all, yes the online play will be free! Big thanks to these people, the price of paying for an online game subscription is ridiculous.This is a review of the october world preview.The graphics were decent and I had no trouble playing it with a simple GFX5200/ATI9000 on medium to high detail.I tried various classes and combination of classes for 3 hours each, I think there is still some power balancing to be done. There were a few bugs but it was good enough for a beta preview to be almost at a perfectly playable level. The main drawback was the lack of a structured systyem to explain what to do and where to go for a quest. The crafting system was interesting and I like the spell system too.I found that leveling was much to quick for a game which allows you only to get to level 20. Within 3 hours I could easily go from lvl 15 to 17.Overall I am preording this game."
5,The Best RPG Since Diablo 2,"There really is only one way to describe Guild Wars; Fantastic. It is by far the best game I have played in ages.For starters it is the first game in a long time that I have not had to wait for a patch in order for it to work.The game play is incredible, and the graphics are great.One thing please pay attention to the system requirements on the box. Many people don't and then wonder why their games don't work."
4,Want an online game that gets to the point?,"This game offers user friendly commands and ""easy to get into"" atmosphere. The best of all, the game has a built-in guide to help you to move the story along. I know, some people would say ""What is a point playing an RPG game if you cannot explore yourself? That is fun of the game."" That is understandable, I like to help people who still like playing with other people online, but do not have a lot of time like before. Yet, still achieve some kind of accomplishment each day. I felt this game delivers this aspect. The graphics are very nice. The sounds are good as well, but not the best I have heard. The music is excellent to provide that ""Fantasy-like"" feeling.I am a gamer on consoles and pc for a long time now. As I get older, I get more ""time concious"" because of work and family and less time for myself. I cannot play online games that require too much exploring with no sense of direction anymore (ex. Everquest and WoW)"
5,Love Guild Wars!,I have been playing Guild Wars off & on for about 2 weeks. I am still in the early part of the game and learning what character combinations I prefer. Have my money's worth for the game already and look forward to many more hours of fun IF I can get the hang of playing with other live people. This is my first on-line game and I'm learning slowly. I have used Google to get very helpful suggestions on how to play. I'm a stay-at-home empty-nester.
5,Guild Wars,"Not since CS first came out have I been so obsessive about this game. Amazing graphics, good PvE game play, an engaging story arc, and possibly the best PvP experience I've ever had.Be it a random arena, Tombs or Guild vs Guild battles, I find it intense, strategic and highly entertaining.This game is easily one of the best PvP games I've ever played."
5,Great Game!!!,"This is one of the best games out there right now. It is a great alternative to WOW, since there are no monthly fees. They are constantly updating the game, and even support the original game as well as the expansion(s). A great by at a great one time price!"
5,All the great things about MMO's with out the monthly fee,"This company has finally done what needed to be done to online gaming for a long time. They have provided a quality product with out a monthly fee.I started playing right when the game first hit the shelves and since then I havent noticed any substantial slow down or anything that would detract from the game.This game is a great experience, its easy to learn and you are not always looking over your shoulder for those PK (player killers) players that just want to spoil the game for everyone.the combat system is top notch alowing for dodgeing, archery, magic and sword and sheild all in one package.I would definatly recomend buying this game if you are even remotly intrested in MMO's (Masive Mult-player Online games)good luck and good gaming."
2,"Graphics are Great, Gameplay is lackluster","For fans of World of Warcraft, this game is pretty similar. The graphics are really pretty impressive, and the world is well developed. I however did not care much for WoW, and found this game to be too similar.On the one hand it is a free online multiplayer game. However the game promised that it would reward skill as opposed to hours spent playing it. I found that to not be the case. Ultimately it boiled down to a Diabloesque click fest. That is okay from time to time if a good story line is layered on top of the game, but I never really got hooked on the story."
3,Great title if you have cheap and fast internet,"I played this game when I couldn't sleep and spent hours without knowing it. It has great graphics and one original class, Mesmer, which I love dearly (psst: create Mesmer/Monk).Since game downloads stuff all the time, you have to be ready to pay flat rate adsl or something like that, otherwise it becomes expensive.Some missions require lotsa time, which I don't HAVE. There are shortcut keys, but you have to learn it through tutorial, you don't get manual in box with disks.It would be nice to have Guild War offline game, and play it alone like Diablo. I simply can't make a team with human players.This way, it is another addictive game via net which dowloads a lot.Oh yeah, if you play alone, warrior/monk seems to be ok...graphics is soo cute!!! Diablo III should look like this!!!"
4,Hours of fun,"I'm pretty impressed with this game thus far. There are many more quests with the first campaign than the second. Many hours of missions, quests, items, and more. This game is the best game of the year version and includes lots of items that you can find that were not in the original version.I definately recommend this if you cannot afford monthly subscription games. Anet hacked monthly fees and all you ever pay for is the game itself. $40 is a decent price for a game with as many hours as this one includes. In my opinion, it is up there with World of Warcraft. There may be a level cap at 20, but there are no further fees nor do you have to find your body after you die. That is a great bonus in my opinion, as it can take hours just to recover your body in other PVE games.This is a must-have for all gamers and even better for younger audiences. A definate for a tight budget. You'll enjoy this!"
1,waterd down Diablo,This is a poor excuse for a MMORPG. It's to much like the worst parts of diablo 3.Wish i could get a refund for this one.
2,NOT WORTH THE $$$$,"My 10 year old daughter loves Yorkies. Yes I read the specs and realized it was only 8"".I guess seeing it arrive in a plastic sealed bag inside a book sized mailer made me realizethis would hardly satisfy her. It's more suitable as a dogs toy. Very rigid. Not soft."
2,new england cookbook,Recipes were fine but I am still appalled that this small paperback was $30.00. A ridiculous price for a cookbook that I was able to carry in my wallet. The book was probably worth $5.00 at the most. Beware buyer!
1,Interstate Batteries,"Received the wrong batteries, they were difficult to return, and would have been very unhappy if I had purchased directly from seller as communication is extremely poor. LOVE the safety of shopping thru Amazon! Once I contacted Amazon the process went quickly and smoothly. Thank you, Amazon!"
2,Incredibly overpriced and worthless,I was in search of a good old fashioned ballet box but couldn't find one so I settled for this. I was incredibly disappointed when it arrived. It was only about four inches across and could never hold a real pair of ballet shoes. Good thing it was a gift for a four year old that wouldn't know the difference.
2,pretty but not practical,"looks great for decorating the table but for one, the little votive under cannot keep things warm for long and secondly because the dish is made from glass the food gets dried up and burned (depending on what the meal is) versus if you used an actual metal chafing dish in which case the food is not directly in contact with heat but rather with warm water."
4,Expensive way to replace the std.,"This mute is great because you don't need to fumble with those annoying clips of the standard bucket, but I was hoping for less buzz, in the sound. The sound it generates isn't that much different from what the standard bucket makes, I thought the copper would make it more mellow."
4,Note to author,"Just wanted you to know how much I enjoyed the book. In so many of the books, I have to skip pages when it comes to violence and/or sex. So it was a pleasure to read a book written about a gentleman by a gentleman. Can we expect a sequel?"
3,Not all that thorough...,"I bought the wrong book...a friend had an awesome rash book and I thought this was it.I got this book in the mail and it has some pictures of rashes, but I found that it didn't cover all of the rashes or what to look for to find variations of the same rash. It was just okay for the basic stuff, but not all that helpful with unique rashes. Not to mention...I wanted to see some closeup pictures of the rashes which the book doesn't really offer. This book is just okay and probably worth the money if it can help you solve one rash which otherwise would have sent you to a doctor. However, you may want to do further research before buying this one and go to the bookstore to check others out first. If you saw other books, this probably wouldn't be your first choice, but admittedly it is quite a bit less $$$.Try to get one that actually helps you eliminate possible rashes and can help you narrow down your potential causes to ID one rash."
3,A Big Fat Disappointment,"After all the hoopla, I was let down. The tape starts promisingly enough, with a fantastic version of ""Hello Bluebird"" completely on par with her film version of the same.Her synergy with her two co-stars is quite nice to watch, spontaneous and relaxed and genuine, unlike the totally weird concert with Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra, also available thru Amazon (but not worth it!)But Garland is not at her best apart from that first number, and the extremely long ""comedy"" skit near the end fell quite flat."
5,Brings back old memories.,"Our granddaughter was the recipient of this game. I am 67 and still have my Uncle Wiggley game from when I was a child. When my granddaughter comes to visit this is the game she most likes to play. We gifted her one for Christmas and was very excited for it. When we first began playing it she couldn't read words, but could read numbers. So she knew how far to jump her Uncle Wiggley, then I would read the card to her. Now she reads and can do most of it herself. I feel it's a good game to ""grow"" into and also fun. I still have many classic games from my childhood, unlike today's generation. I hope she will keep hers and love it as I did."
5,Great game for kids!,"These stories are great, who couldn't love a rabbit with rheumatoid arthritis! I got this game along with one of the books as an Easter gift for my niece and nephews. I had received the book and game as a gift from my aunt when I was a child and wanted to continue on the tradition. I am told that Howard Roger Garis is distantly related to me, I wish I knew more about the family tree but I take comfort in knowing that I am passing along the little family history that I know."
4,Uncle Wiggily,"I had this game when I was a kid and shared it with my daughter, she is now 27. In one of our many moves during life, we lost the game. I purchased this game again to give to my daughter as she missed it."
3,great game,great game kids loved it. Brought back memories for me I had this as a kid & really liked it
2,not a learn to read game,"I was disillusioned. They bill this as a ""learn to read"" game, but it is not that at all. The cards are written at an advanced level of reading and it requires an adult to read the cards. However, kids can ""play"" by simply moving the number of spaces indicated."
5,Kids learn to read the easy way,"Uncle Wiggily has the same appeal as a Dr. Seuss book. The characters are whimsical, the art appealing, and the rhymes help struggling readers. As a high school English teacher, I sometimes get asked by friends to help their children who are having trouble learning to read. I always bring out my Uncle Wiggily game, which has been in my family for about 30 years. Now I am delighted to be able to buy a copy for a friend's family, whose children always ask to play the game when they come over. Call it nostalgia or call it Peter Pan Syndrome...I still enjoy the game myself!"
4,fun little poems lead to Dr. Possum,"A winding pathway of one hundred steps takes Uncle Wiggily, the long-eared hare, to Doctor Possum's house. Players pick cards, read the little poem and travel the number of spaces specified. A few spaces tell the player to go back three spaces, but otherwise the action is all forward with no strategy or skill involved. Kids like the rhymes and this is good for those who are learning to read. Family fun, though not much challenge. Nice game board."
1,NOT the old Uncle Wiggily - SIMPLIFIED,"I was so disappointed when I played this new version of the game. I loved the old version. This one is so simplified it is stupid. The old game was not difficult to play there were just more possibilities.There are no more cards directing one to go to a particular place on the board (moving you far ahead or back depending on your location), just numbers of places to move.There is no mention of Uncle Wiggily's rheumatism or why he is going to the doctor's at the end (which I always found intriguing as a child).This is not entertaining for any child except the youngest and then they can't read the cards (though they even dumbed that down by putting the number in large print at the top of each card.I guess I have to look on ebay for an original game as this one is too boring to play."
3,The magic flute,"The music of Mozart is so easy to listen to, that even not musically talented people can enjoy it. many reviewers over the centuries analyzed the libretto and read many hidden meanings into it. Schikaneder, the actor who wrote the libretto never would have been known, were it not for Mozarts music. The magic flute is so much fantasy and so colorful, that all opera-houses compete to bring something different to their production. With DVDs you can watch performances from all over the world. This one is neither imaginative, nor colorful, which is disappointing to me. Therefore I give it just 3 stars."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Worth about $18.00, but not much more.Firstly, the picture quality is quit grainy on my 42"" 1080 HD TV...probably shot on non HD Video. Looks almost as bad as a VHS tape...The lighting is too dark in many places. The opera has only one sparsely decorated set. The costumes are OK, but not great.The singers, none of whom I know, are again OK, but none are memorable.The directing and acting routine, orchestra all OK, but not memorable....The English is OK, but there are no subtitles and I cannot aways understand the words..All told, I would advise to spend more on a blue ray disk, with a better cast, and you would enjoy this great opera better."
4,A man called Ham,I recommend this book to adults. This content seemed pretty real. I think he has had some of these experiences. It was an interesting story line. I enjoyed talking about it with my co-workers. I think it was well written. True to the time.
5,Liked the first season? Then you'll like this one too.,"It's a great anime with great visuals and awesome audio that you'll just want to turn up your home stereo.This Blu-Ray comes in a box that has an extra slot so you can put in your First Season Blu-Ray in it and save a little bit of shelf space.Expect the same or more fan service in this season and a great time watching it with your friends or family (if they don't judge you ^,^/) because even Hollywood is getting old :p"
4,good.,well written and animated series. suspense sequences are ab bit too long for me. after a little while the intended effects lose their potency but while the climaxes have you in their grip it is an awesome emotional ride!
3,Funey Good Time,I injoyed it Emensley. Good Lafe all a Rawnd. Exsiting and Theriling. Non Stop Acshin and Comede. A Good Lafe
5,STRIKE WITCHES FTW!!!!!!!!!,"Glad to know they are finally putting out season 2 and even better a Blu-ray/Dvd combo pack, I can't wait to get it, I'm excited ><"
4,Good History of the Interpreting Profession,"While this book could stand an update, it is a good overview of the interpreting profession with lots of helpful information (granted, some of which you can find by doing simple Web searches). Anyone thinking about becoming an interpreter would do well to read this book to get an understanding of the history of the profession or to perhaps effectively advocate for better pay rates or working conditions for interpreters. (most of an interpreters work is done in the prep time for a job, but interpreters only get paid for actual on site interpreting time... hmm, perhaps a paradigm shift should be in the works, if all interpreters work together to make that happen.)"
2,tapered hole,"The 1"" dia. hole for the hitch ball was tapered. It was 1"" at the top and at least 1-1/8"" at the bottom. It should have been rejected by any honest inspector."
3,Episode Titles:,This 2 VHS set only has 4 episodes (2 for each VHS).They are:Gracie's Vegetarian PlotGracie Gives a WeddingProperty Tax AssessorChristmas Episodebut no dates are given for the episodes.
5,Common Sense,"I found Black People in the Bible to be clear, concise and obviously culled from reputable sources. Some aspects of the book did what so few other documents seem to address...the application of common sense. It is unfortunate that a book had to be prepared to show that the original humans, Africans, can be found throughout the Bible. I thank Randolph Jackson for making the obvious even more apparent and user friendly."
2,Exercises in Ultrasonography,"I have to say that I thought this book would have more review questions in each chapter. Once you get passed chapter 1, you may get 15 to 20 review questions. I had hope to see more questions. The author failed to give an explanation to the questions and answers. Each chapter starts off with review questions. I would have expected to have read about the subjects before seeing the review questions.In the instructions for students the author says ""Pay attention to the key words and objectives"". Well I was certainly dispointed because I did not see any key words and objectives.The book contains unlabeled images and illustrations for every chapter but it failed to identify and describe the parts of the anatomy in the image. They leave up to you to figure out the parts of the image.I am certainly disappointed.MCP"
5,Disappointed,This book was recommended by Beth Moore so I'm certain the book is awesome. I'm disappointed that it's not available for purchase.
3,"Familiar, yet still pleasant sounding...","This music is very Stevie Wonder-ish, circa 1970s. That shouldn't be a bad thing, except for the fact that so many musicians(secular and gospel) have dipped into this bag. While PJ's voice certainly isn't all that dynamic and lacks range, it does have a quality that makes him easy to listen too. Easy listening...hmmm.Because many of PJs stylings sound trite and cliche I doubt this album will be on repeat in my mp3 player. Still, I'd recommend this to adults who like urban-flavored Christian music. Adult Urban/Contemporary...hmmm. I sense a theme developing here..."
1,False Advertising,"False advertising, these are not the complete seasons. Just volume 1 and 2 together for a total of 20 episodes."
3,This is what it is described as,"but I missed the day to day calender at the Peggy Sharp workshop last year at it isn't available on line if at all. That was the kind of calender I was looking for and this is not it. It has great artwork and some birthdays, but not a full calender of children's literature. So for anybody in the market for that style of a resource keep looking. If your looking for what is described then you will be please as punch."
1,Don't waste your money,"This shelf is flimsy and made of plastic. The T.V. is not stable on this shelf, it cannot handle any significant weight let alone a television. I got the exact item from Overstock.com and am sending it back."
1,Part Does Not Work On Most Engines,According to Edelbrock and Cloyes technical support experts;this timing chain and gears were never intended to be used on engines with cam shaft balance systems. Once again the Amazon parts locating system has failed to make the proper recommendation to me. This added additional downtime to a vehicle restore job.If you order here be sure you attempt to install your part very soon because the return policy is only 90 days.
2,Not very technical,"Although I appreciated the fact that I was viewing actual/real footage of the sun, I was very disappointed at the lack of technical information provided by the dvd. Too much time was spent on cultural references and the suns impact on them."
4,New Recordings - Don't Expect Yes,"I would have to say that the title is accurate, as I can't think of what other music I might want on 3 CDs. It's also interesting to hear someone other than Jon Anderson sing those Yes songs. However, the reason I don't give 5 stars is that time and the opportunity to massage the music does not result in improvement. These were great songs before and they still are, but the changes do not enhance the experience. In fact, for 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth,' I think the original with full chorus and orchestra was MUCH better. However, for those of you wanting a new twist on some real classics, give it a whirl!"
1,Gak!,"Another Bad Book from this ghost writer. I'm really looking forward to the ""new"" Destroyers from the new publisher and team of Murphy and Mullaney. M&M; - great candy, great authoring pair!This book on the other hand, should have melted the word processor it was thrown together on. This is not the Remo and Chiun we all know, the plot was lame, and it is best forgotten."
2,This Book is About 10 Years Out of Date,"Cellular Mobile Radio Systems: Designing Systems for Capacity Optimization contains some good basic communications theory, which would be useful to a sophomore engineering student. However, in my opinion, the content is woefully out of date and of little use to a contemporary cellular network engineer. Most of the references cited are from the 1980's or earlier, there is little mention of GSM and I could find no discussion of the North American TDMA-136 or CDMA standards. This was especially disconcerting given the 1997 copyright date. For the purposes of determining the ultimate capacity possible from any of the modern cellular radio standards, this book falls short."
5,Erno Lazlo product,Product quality related to the marketed one. Fast shipping. Will recommend to others to use this site. Thank you for the good service.
2,So-So,"I know Barnard is supposedly a very goodwriter but I just cant seem to get intohis books. They're not ones I ""cant put down"". Also the title is, Death of a Literary Widow. In an apt bldg live twoelderly women who were both married to thesame man. They seldom talk to each otherprobably becausethey cant stand each other.The first wife living upstairs he divorced.The 2nd wife living on the first floor shebecame a widow when he died. Excuse me forgiving anything away but the first wife gotkilled in a fire in the bldg. She was thedivorced wife. The 2nd escaped the fire.The title would seem to denote that it should be the 2nd wife who dies as she isthe widow-to my way of thinking she shouldbe the one that gets killed as she was thewidow of their husband. I tend to analyzelittle things but just wondered if thisoccurred to anyone else."
3,Decent book for first timers,"There isn't a lot in here for someone that's been running any kind of sports practices for a while, but it's a good beginners book."
3,Silver salve for healing,I've used a lot of silver salves or colloidial silver gels and i don't think this one stacks up to others. It is quite watery. I would buy the ASAP brand over this product.
3,"""Best if used by...""","Just received the anxiously awaited product. It took me several uses before I realized that the bottom of the jar read: ""Best if used by 2/11"" (!!!) Wow, I received it on 08/23/11. I contacted Amazon Customer Support via email. This morning, it looks as if they're sending out another one. If that is the case, I will ammend this review. C'mon guys...Quality Control? Besides, this is an item that can almost ""disappear"" if not kept tightly closed (I've read in some reviews of many brands). Does anyone really want to start off w/a product that is months past it's most effective date. Updates to follow.Update:Contacted Amazon Customer Service via email. Two (2) days later, new jar arrived with expiration date of ""2/14"" I upped from 1 star to three (3) stars to commend Amazon Customer Service and the amazingly fast replacement. Didn't even have to contact seller. KUDOS, Amazon! Let's see how the product works now."
1,Out of stock,"I don't know why these sellers advertise as in stock, when after you order then you have to cancel because it never was in stock in the first place. What a hassle."
5,Every houshold needs this.,"I have used this product for the past 5 years and another one like it for 20 years. It is the single best healing agent you can put on burns from flames or burns from sun. It acts like a natural antibiotic and I think in the past silver collidial was once used as such in the liquid form wich i have used as well. but this topical form is perfect for blistering and pain and It helps all sorts of infections, funguses bites,etc. I keep it handy in my kitchen and bathroom for cuts, burns anything that could get infected. when I burn myself with a curling iron, I apply a small amount immediately and I promise you.NO Scarring and pain subsides with in minutes. It really is awesome produt to have around. I even bought some for my work at a coffee shop for burns we tend to get. It lasts for a long time as long as you keep the lid on tight. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
5,all around good stuff,works well for small cuts and skin problems. it even works well for minor burns and the silver in it increases the healing time
1,Careful with allergies,"We tried this salve on an open wound since the collodial silver bandaids worked so well to promote healing. Instead, my wife went the urgent care facility with chemical burns from the product. Stay away if you have sensitivity to citric products."
3,Just okay,I got this book for a literature class. It has a great collection of stories but was very hard to get around. The lack of orginization made it difficult to enjoy.
4,Wonderful!,"I read this 'spiritual novel' in a day. Wonderful! I'll read it again soon, no doubt. If you are interested in personal growth and you are gay, this is a inspiring and affirmative book about life and being gay. The spiritual lessons taught to the main character, who is trying to find his place in the world, are Universal and for everyone of us, but the fact that the guy is gay makes it just a little bit more special and personal...well at least for me. A wonderful job from the authors who include their life pupose and mission statement in this book which is obviously something very near and dear to their heart."
4,Great spiritual lesson,"This very easy-to-read book was both entertaining and informative. The story deals with a gay guy who is working at accepting himself and also deciding what he is supposed to do with his life. He meets a mentor that helps him realize how to find the answers to his situation and direction for his future. And along the way, he learns how to seek and find his value and purpose in life. Great spiritual lesson written in a way that is easy to comprehend and accept. Whether you are straight or gay, I would definitely recommend this book."
1,9 of the 10 Commandments?,"Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron describe the 10 Commandments are like ""10 loaded cannons,"" but only 9 are ""loaded"" - if you go by the logic that the 7th day Sabbath doesn't matter to God. It is the only commandment that tells us the following:1.Who to worship. 2. Why to worship. 3. When to worship. 4. How to worship (by keeping the 7th day holy) and 5. Remembering to worship.(The Sabbath was made for ""man"" Mark 2:27 - ....not The Sabbath was made for ""Jews"")Also, I wish that the authors would have addressed these verses about hell because God says throughout the Bible the wicked will be annihilated - reduced to nonexistence...Malachi 4:1-3""all who do wickedly will be stubble.And the day which is coming shall burn them up,""Says the LORD of hosts,""That will leave them neither root nor branch.""Matthew 10:282 Peter 3:10Psalm 37:10Isaiah 47:14Malachi 4:1-3Matthew 3:12"
3,it's over when you have just started to sweat and enjoy it,"Somewhat dissapointing because I like her earthy moves but routine is short. She is easy to follow so you feel better that you are getting into. Then, just when you are getting the endorphins, it is over.

1,Arrived in horrible condition,"I wonder if the people who packed this gift even looked at the box prior to shipping. It had black scuff marks and obvious black fingerprints all over it, plus weird orange spots all over the front.This was a gift and I not only had to go through the trouble to return it but also had to go out and try to find a replacement at the last second. I'll never buy another product from this manufacturer again."
2,Ok read but...,I was a little disappointed about this book. I have read Ms Washington's books and loved them all. I couldn't get into this book it to me a week or longer to finish. The love and the romance was great as her other books but I just wasn't feeling this couple or the sub characters in the story. The start was hard to get into. The story was ok but to think we still have men acting like the cave man was a hard grasp. One the story really heated up it went back cold. I give this book a two. Maybe next time. Don't be put off by this Ms. Washington other books are great.
4,Finding Love Again- Great Read,"I enjoyed reading Finding Love Again. I thought it was a wonderful book. It started off a little slow, but once the story heated up, I couldn't wait to get to the next page. The love scenes were exciting and sexy, and the storyline had me hooked. I'm a fan of Ms. Washington's previous book, Guarded Love, and I'm sure you will love this book also. I give it 4 stars."
2,very poor video quality !,From the start the video images are fuzzy and the color is awful. Anything in black appears green. Judy's hair appears grey.....I could go on and on The sound is great but the color and fuzzy images make it hard to enjoy. I wished for something much better. I would have liked to know that the video had been altered from the original black and white.And it should be noted that the images are a mess.
2,"JUDY,FRANK AND DEAN ONCE IN A LIFE TIME","ITS GREAT TO SEE THEM ALL THREE SIGNING, BUT NOT A GREAT SHOW."
5,Best intro on the subject,"I looked at several introductions to Egyptian and this seemed to be the easiest and clearest entry into the subject. The text by Collier/Manley is more detailed and gives more information from a structural linguistics standpoint, but I would read this book to get an understanding of the alphabet, basic symbols, diglyphs, triglyphs, phonetics, and word overall structure before tackling their book. The book also contains sample translations and exercises to test your comprehension, and it's nicely illustrated with actual inscriptions from cartouches and Tutankhamen's tomb, so you get the real stuff.Although I have a pretty strong background in both applied and theoretical linguistics, I still found this book valuable before reading the more technical works. After reading this you'll have a good background for the more advanced books. All in all I highly recommend it as the best starter text around."
3,Very Basic,"While this book is easy to read and entertaining, it doesn't provide much insight into the structure of the Egyptian language. It mostly teaches the meaning and vocalization of a few signs, and provides some examples of how these signs would be combined into an inscription. This book would be good for people who are curious about the hieroglyphs, and want to learn the real basics. Anyone with a deeper interest in the Egyptian language/culture would probably find Collier/Manley introduction to the hieroglyphs more helpful."
3,Barely adequate,"The cold pocket is so small, it barely holds the insulin. If you are using the pens, count on just carrying one, in the space at the zipper. The cold pack is so full of air, I worry it will break. The meter and accessories area is adequate. A holder or some area for an ink pen would be nice for those keeping a journal. It does the job, but I'm going back to my converted belt pack."
4,Handy 2 pack,"I bought this for a friend. Good product, good price, fast delivery and handy to have an extra on hand."
4,Still gets me,"It's been awhile that this show had been on the air back in 1997 I believe and I still remember it still today.It Does not need great acting from it's cast. Just be fun action and adventure just the way I love these type of low budget show that air many years ago.Takes place inAcapulco,and what an great place for some ACTION,girl in bikinis evrywhere and low TEC special effect.The second series is just as good as the first one back in 1994. All the ACTION in that show was also great and I do have the first season on DVD too. Any guy or gal who loves Action Adventure in the tropics this the show to get. So rush out and buy it;or get here on Amazom.com."
5,Succulent poetry,"I thoroughly enjoyed Gottlieb's second poetry collection ""Why Things Burn"" (which was a Lambda Literary Award nominee), and have been looking forward to reading ""Pelt"", and now I just don't know why I waited so long. Gottlieb's poetry is vibrant and succulent. This is poetry with tongue (sharp and biting, speaking truths, caressing and loving, devouring the reader in return). Covering topics from childhood to womanhood, from relationships to the world at large, ""Pelt"" is an amazing book exploring the true things in human experience."
2,"Limited usefulness, states the obvious.","This is a book that contains lots of words, but little insight. It merely puts into words that which is obvious...declare your committment to your kids, set aside time for them, etc. There are no secrets here. The author suggests that ""fathering support groups"" are popping up all over the US....groups of dads are getting together at coffee shops to talk about fathering. We must not frequent the same shops, because I just don't see it. Don't waste your time on this book."
2,dry as the desert wind,"This movie was a huge letdown for our entire extended family of all ages. There are so many ""dry"" spells you almost fall asleep. One good laugh every 30 minutes isn't enough for me. You hardly see Kirby Heybourne, the famous ""Mormon"" actor. The leader in charge of the shooting range was the only ""out there"" character in the whole movie. Very amatuer movie altogether. No wonder it was not marketed for theater release. If you have boys that want to see what scout camp MIGHT be like, then this is the movie for them. And the truth is, they may never want to go after watching this."
2,scoutmom,"We ordered this after seeing it displayed at the National Jamboree this year. We were not very entertained, as we thought it was a bit dry."
1,Awful,"Yes I am a boy scout. Now that we have that out of the way, I am a film Major and have to say that is a horrible piece of crap. Why say that? Because its an insult to scout camps around the nation. If this ""director"" had actually been to a camp, he would have learned WONDERS on how to portray camping for a week. The acting, script, cinematography, music are all OVERLY BAD and look as though it was made with $5.AVOID AVOID AVOID."
1,Zero stars was not an option.,"First of all, they stole my band's music and didn't even put us in the credits.Second, the movie sucks. Seriously. In the words of one of the characters, it stinks so bad it, ""made my nose hairs curl and die"". WORST. MOVIE. I'VE. EVER. SEEN."
2,Kinda lame,"Was hoping for a fun show for my boys, but it was rather flat and pointless. I was hoping for something like RM or Down and Derby, but didn't meet the hopes."
3,Scout Camp - Fun,"I have 3 scouts so I bought this movie as a Christmas gift to them. Movie definitely wasn't Oscar material but still fun. Boys got some laughs out of it. Being in the scouting environment, you pick up on little flaws here and there, but overall it was worth the buy. We've brought it to a couple of scout movie nights and the other boys liked it too. The boys favorite part was the extras and the music video included."
2,High hope - low result,"I really wanted to like this movie, previewed it and wasn't sure if it would hold the scouts attention. While on a road trip to camp, tried it out and the scouts elected no movie over finishing this one."
3,VANILLA,"I actually showed this movie to a group of scouts (11-13 in age) at an actual scout camp during a boy scout camp week. Although there are a few memorable moments that the scouts could actually relate to, most of it did not hold the scout's interest very long. The plotline related to the disappearance of the ""spirit stick"" might reflect some of the camps out there, but not this one. Much of this movie was pretty dry."
1,Poorly Done,"This DVD is not worth $20 or even $10 to say the least. Please save your money! The acting and filming are terrible. I had very low expectations of this movie and was still very disappointed. I bought this movie for my Dad for Christmas, my Dad is a scout master so I thought he would love it, and no one in my family liked it!"
3,Pretty silly but it is what it is,This one was fairly ridiculous but I guess that was to be expected. The story was weak yet still somewhat entertaining if that makes sense. It is what it is. We still enjoy watching it once or twice a year.
4,Excellent book for those that the stories of warriors,I found that this book is well written and very close to the truth on how things were. The author is as good as W. E. B Griffing
2,Chemical smell and sticky,"I have tried this product on my arms and legs to help my Keritosis Pilaris, the product has worked some what but the chemical smell put me off. Also when I first put the cream on it dries sticky and made my skin tingle. It didn't get rid of the KP (I'm still using it as I can't afford anything else) but a combination of using this cream and exfoliating has made it slightly better....not the miracle I was hoping for though :0("
3,Excellent for dry skin but not for KP,"I found this lotion to be great for dry skin, but I've used it for a month and seen no visible results to help the red bumps of Keratosis Pilaris. It did smooth the rough part of my skin. The lotion is also thin and a little sticky, but effective as far as moisture goes. If it was helpful for those with KP I'd give 5 stars."
4,Effective Overnight Exfoliant; Less Than Ideal for Daytime Use,"Very effective exfoliant, but as others have said the ammonium scent and the slightly tacky residue it leaves on the skin make it somewhat less than ideal for use during day. I find it best to apply it at night, then shower it off in the morning and use Cetaphil as my daytime moisturizer."
1,Does not work for KP,"If you are considering buying this to treat Keratosis Pilaris, then dont! It does not work! causes reddness and itching too!"
5,It seems some people aren't listening...,"Chick's Ultimate Adventure is aptly titled. I have nearly EVERY recording he and his associates have ever done, and I have been to every performance they've done locally. How anyone could think this isn't the most phenomenally composed and performed recording he has ever produced is beyond me. Did you listen to it ONCE and write the review? I've been listening to it almost daily for months and the depth and breadth of this recording always reveals something new. I've told friends that if they bought it and didn't love it, I'd buy it from them. I don't think I'm prepared to offer that here. Sorry. I guess if you don't ""get it"" you don't get it. I doubt he loses any sleep at night wondering if sales are going well. In fact, after talking with him several times, I know sales are not what motivates him. Chick is an amazing person, and in my opinion, the ultimate musician!"
2,"Boring, but better than To The Stars","Chick Corea is wonderful. However, his last two efforts, To The Stars and The Ultimate Adventure, are boring. It ""feels"" stale. All of the tunes sound the same and Chick uses some of that horrible sounding keyboard effects. A lot of flute with melodies that are all over the place all the time! Nothing sticks in your head. There's no recognizable melody to identify the tune and the playing seems to lack any emotion. Just a bunch of notes written down for great musicians to read. This album is probably as boring as the novel. Buy Acoustic Band, Friends, Now He Sings, Now He Sobs or Three Quartets. This is garbage."
2,Like a beautiful cake that has no flavor---one taste is enough,"I like my music with more substance than detail. On ""The Ultimate Adventure,"" Mr. Corea lavishes the music with layers of detail delivered by a galaxy of talented musicians. The songs are glittering, polished, fluid, and slick.But despite the glitzy trappings, the final product lacks substance and is neither engaging nor inspiring. (Haven't we all heard this conflation before and put to better use than spinning aural yarns tied to a pseudo-fantasy novel?) Put another way, this recording is like a beautiful cake that has no flavor---one taste is enough."
3,Chick still won't come in from the cold,"Chick Corea is one of those musicians who is constantly trying to reinvent himself or, at least, reinvent his music. Sometimes, he forgets to make music. This is not one of those times, fortunately. This CD is rich and lush and full and vibrant. Each song is meant to evoke some sort of exotic, faraway, unfamiliar place and time, and each song succeeds in doing that. The problem is, you end up nowhere in particular. Spain? No. Africa? No, not really. Some island somewhere? Maybe. If the idea is to confuse the listener into unquestioning submission to Chick's musical will, I guess he has succeeded. When Chick's record company does an updated version ofBest of Chick Corea, none of the songs from this CD will be on there, but just the same, there is enough of interest here to say this CD might not be a complete pass for a typical jazz music lover."
1,same warmed over crap,"I liked Chick's early stuff from the 70's because it was so ground-breaking. This stuff is just too busy; a bunch of fast runs and scales that are not compelling at all. Maybe Chick's gotten into a rut and needs to go back and write children's songs for piano. The emotional aspect is missing from this CD. I've listened to samples of all the cuts and there is no soul on any of them. Sorry Chick, this CD doesn't cut it for me."
2,Lame . . . what you wouldn't expect from Mr. Corea,"My sympathies to Chick and his family. Evidently Chick was involved in some sort of accident that left him musically incapacitated. As the owner of at least 13 Chick Corea CDs, this one is at the bottom of the list (actually, on the trade off list). Boring & musically uneventful. After reading the reviews I thought ""I must get this CD (""Inside Out"" was the last one I bought). I was hesitant and I should've gone with my instincts (it stinks). Forget that the music is uninspiring and the melodies forgetful, there's not even enough technical acrobatics to amaze if even for a moment. I suggest giving this one a miss until Chick recovers."
5,Inspired piece of music,"I'm a huge fan of Chick Corea. The previous album ""To the stars"" was not as great as this (although I watched the Electric band perform those songs in Toronto and was amazed by the performance). At first you listen to the songs and it somehow sounds the same. Then, as you play it over and over again you start to discover the depth of the compositions. It reminded me of when I first listened to ""The Leprechaun"", I was not impressed but kept listening and now that is one of my favorite Chick Corea albums. Sometimes it takes time to really appreciate something. If you love good instrumental music buy this. The musicians are outstanding."
4,Oh yeah!,"Andrea ""Andy"" Kendricks had never been the deb her mother, Cissy Kendricks, had hoped for. Andy was a web designer who enjoyed taking care of herself and living in a small place, rather than being pampered and living in a mansion.When Andy?s old college roommate, Molly O?Brien, was accused of killing her boss, Bud, Andy rushed to help. Molly had worked at Jugs, a type of restaurant where the waitresses made those at Hooters look like children. To prove Molly innocent, Andy must go undercover?padded bras, tight pants, layers of cosmetics, and all!**** This is the first of a new mystery series. The author gives the reader a bit of humor to tweak the seriousness of typical mysteries. The result is a delightful new type of mystery that will entice its readers and leave them eager to see what Andrea will do next. Recommended! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
5,AWESOME Debut Novel - First in Anticipated New Series,"Sheer delight to read. Enticing from the first chapter and keeps you reading. A great ""Who Dunnit"" which will suprise you at the end who the actual killer is. GREAT and a definate must read.Author Susan McGrath is a delight. She's written back to me to let me know that her 2nd installment to this new series ""THE GOOD GIRL'S GUIDE TO MURDER"", will be out in February of 2005. I can't wait.Please DO buy this book, you will not be disappointed!"
3,An Ok Book...,"I wanted to like this book, but found it to be a little boring. The author writes too much dialogue going on in the main character's head. Boring. Andrea continually asks herself the same questions over and over again. I find myself skipping ahead to the real dialogue...and not just the stuff in her head. I also don't like weak characters who can't say no... that's very frustrating!"
2,"Cute, but No Challenge.","This is a fun ""workout"" but it is certainly not at all challenging and definitely made for beginners. Lindsay Brinn is a decent instructor and the moves are pretty fun overall, but if you are looking for a challenging workout (or simply one that will actually raise your heart rate), look elsewhere."
4,"Fun, easier workout","I like this DVD. I usually do this workout when I need a break from more intense workouts. There is a section that shows you the moves, but I wanted to get right into the workouts, so I skipped it. It took me just a couple of times and I easily caught on to the steps. This DVD is great for beginners or for those of you looking for an easier DVD to add to your collection."
1,"Wow, Please tell me they stopped selling this!!",One word - HORRIBLE!!!! Did not work. Complete waste of money and time.
5,Supreme Magic!,"Mary Wilson's sexy voice shines on ballads produced by the Holland Brothers, formerly of Holland-Dozier-Holland who produced most of The Supremes' early hits. Soaring sopranos from Scherrie Payne and Susaye Green, tight harmonies and intricate vocal interplay, good songs and the Motown Sound make this one The Supremes' tightest (and best!) albums ever. Sweeping hypnotic rhythms and jazzy charts on the dynamic ""High Energy"" title track launch The Supremes into stratospheric new territory and ""I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do The Walking"" became a Billboard Top 40 hit in 1976 despite little or no promotion from Motown."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this for Christmas because I bake a lot more then and I like to give baked goods as presents. I like it because instead of using all those little pans and having to figure out balance in the oven etc, it saves me that time. Works something like a popover pan as opposed to individual ramekins. Plus, saves me from having to reach way back to pull out little pans, instead i could pull this out easily- saves on potentially getting burnt. My one peeve is the size is a little too small, but that could be just my take on the size. i would probably get another one, just because they are so convenient"
4,Great find!,"Zuchini is abundent this year.. My daughter wanted this pan to be able to make zuchini bread easier to handle for bake sales and sharing with neighbors. This is a great pan, easy removal and cleanup. Would recomend this item to anyone. In fact, we gave a friend the information to order because we cannot find it in stores."
4,Mini loaf pan,Great for individual meat loafs. I had one prior to this one that rusted and looked all over to replace it. This one is perfect.
3,Petite Loaf Pan,It would have been nice to know the size of the individual loaf before I bought them. I was looking for a slightly larger loaf.
3,Not as nonsticky as I hoped!,"In my opinion a good nonstick baking pan does not need to be sprayed with cooking spray to prevent sticking. This one definitely did. It's a well-built pan, though, and makes cute sized loaves."
5,MULTI USE PAN,I LOVE THIS PAN! MAKES PERFECT MINI CAKES & BREADS FOR GIFT GIVING AS WELL AS FOR MY FAMILY. ALSO GREAT FOR INDIVIDUAL MEATLOAF SERVINGS. WILL USE FOR YEARS TO COME.
2,cute but not durable,"The size is great, and I love being able to make mini-loaves. However, the non-stick coating has just started flaking off my SECOND set of these pans. I use them about every second week, they've never been in the dishwasher and each pan lasted about 2 years before peeling.Non-stick is great until you discover the banana bread you've been feeding your toddler has pretty silver flakes all over it... I'll look for some other brand for the third set."
2,Non-stick coating flakes off,"This is a fun product at first. Mine lasted about two years before the non-stick coating started coming off in big flakes. I was conscientious about cleaning the pans only with a nylon scrubby and I never used metal utensils to remove the bread from the pans. Always hand washed, no dishwasher. Now my two pans will serve as parts sorting bins in my husband's shop, because that's all they're good for. I'm disappointed."
4,SURPRISINGLY PLEASED!,"Purchased product for $6.45 and have no complaints. The mini breads slid right out of pans after baking with non-stick spray. Searched a longtime for a reasonably priced mini loaf pan to try, since I was very unhappy with my farberware."
5,Wow!,"I'm so sorry that the reviewer in El Salvador feels that Ramirez' work has been ""destroyed"" in our effort, feeling its moods as dismal. In fact, the tempi and moods in this one and those in Ramirez' own recording made in Argentina when Misa Criolla was much younger, are not all that far apart! The biggest difference between ours and his is our adaptations of the instrumentation, legitimate in a still-evolving work like this one inspired by folk music, performed and recorded before with one tenor soloist. Ours has three, along with the extra excitement their ensemble singing provides, and the traditional and modern instruments are played in our recording, as in the composers, by specialists from Argentina.I love this music, these performances of it and this recording, The more I still listen after having long completed the lengthy process of recording then preparing it for publication, I continue to hear in it new things to savour.Curt Wittig, recordist & mastering engineer for this CD"
5,stimulating new music,"This is extremely exhilarating and energetic music, played by wonderful musicians. I throughly enjoyed it on my first listening and now im hooked. I love the first movement of ""Travels"" and listen to it while driving. The serene third movement of ""Travels"" is played with a great emotion by the group and is a must hear."
5,"GREAT FOLLOW-UP, CAN'T WAIT FOR U.S. VERSION!","This CD deserves to be #1 ALL over the world, and hopefully it will be released in the U.S. Jan. '07 as planned (it was originally set for an August 29th release, but then it was postponed because of failed radio play). The first single ""I'm Not Missing You"" is one of the best songs I have heard in the past 3 or 4 years and it deserved to be recognized as being so (at least in my opinion it did). Here is a track listing:1. So Simple2. I'm Not Missing You3. Dream You4. Easy To Luv You5. Save Me6. Take Me Away7. Babygirl8. Wait9. Is It Me10. Don't Ask Me To Stay11. I Can't Give It Up12. Beautiful AwakeningAnd there is an enhanced video of her single supposedly, all the more reason to order this CD, I couldn't wait until Jan. '07 for it so I ordered my copy last week and its on its way to me as I write this. CAN'T WAIT!"
2,Different from her 1st CD,"I don't know what was going on in Stacie's life or did the record company interfere, but God was left out of this cd. Nice vocals of course, but wasn't what I expected."
4,Reciept-delivery,"Awesome quality and excellent delivery timeframes. no complaints, no concerns. lksdjf sdfkjlkj sdkfjsdoif sdlfkjoiju dfiosdfj sdflidsofiju sdkjweoeirulk dsofil dsofio Thanks."
5,THE BEST EVER ALBUM FROM JOURNEY WITH STEVE PERRY,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. Steve Perry with Jonathan Cain writing most of the songs made the album more credible than their previous work. Faithfully is by far my favorite song of all time. I can listen to it and I just fall apart and cry because Steve Perry sings it with such feeling you can feel the passion pouring out of him. Separate Ways, Send Her My Love, After the Fall, Troubled Child, Edge of the Blade and Rubicon are all my new favorites on this album. I love the bonus tracks especially Only the Young and Ask the Lonely. Steve Perry gives new meaning to the phrase LEGEND. That's what he is with this album and his other album either solo or with Journey. He will be remembered that way forever with future generations to come. Journey without him is just another band but with him it is legendary."
5,Journey - At Their Peak,"""Frontiers"" is what I consider the last great album of the Steve Perry era of Journey. The following album ""Raised On Radio"" would see a significant change in personnel and much more of an R & B influence which was not a great move to my ears. ""Frontiers"" still contains the elements of what made Journey great, and contains several of the band's all time best songs. Two of the singles released from this one, ""Separate Ways"", and ""Faithfully"" are as good as any that they ever put out, and the songs still get tons of radio airplay to this day. The rest of the album is also solid, with ""Back Talk"" being the only clunker in the bunch. Journey was at the peak of their powers when this album was released and the material has held up quite well. In addition to the original album this CD version contains 4 bonus tracks, all of which are winners. ""Only The Young"", ""Ask The Lonely"", ""Liberty"" and ""Only Solutions"" are all solid songs that really add to the quality of this collection."
1,Fell apart after 3 months,"These shoes were the best pair of boots I ever had until about 3 months into wearing them. I picked Dr.Martens because I heard someone mention the lifetime warranty, so without researching further, I figured I would pay the high price of these pair of shoes. Bad mistake, as a little less than 3 months the bottom of the left boot began to split apart (it was obvious it was a manufacturer defect). I looked up the return policy...and I cant return after 60 days, especially if they have been wore. I tried the lifetime warranty....WRONG...only on certain shoes, their ""lifetime"" line. So frustrated at these shoes costing so much and getting so little out of them."
5,Copper Canyon 10 Review,"I purchased this tent for mostly summer camping trips with my girlfriend. I've used it 3 times so far and am thrilled with the tent. It sets up in about 10 minutes with two people. It easily fits our queen air mattress with room for bags. It rained heavily 2 days in a row and the tent stayed completely dry inside. Features like the power port, large windows on all four walls, and bathtub floors show that it was designed with care. Though it's minor, the burnt orange color is quite nice. I would recommend it 100%.Pros:- Easy set-up- Great ventilation- Spacious for 2 people- Stays dry- Solid frameCons:- Thin floor material. Laying a heavy-duty tarp under the tent will solve this problem."
4,Good Family Tent,"This tent is good, it has lot of space because of nearly vertical walls. I could fit my intex airbed in this easily. It is easy to get in and get out because of height.Required two people to set up the tent and it took almost 20 minutes to complete. Setting up rainfly is little tricky but we got it at the end. My family was really happy with this tent. I would recommend this to anybody who want to tent camp with family."
3,great tent but no zipper warenty,I think this is a wonderful tent however I had two issues on our two of them as in year one we had a bungee cord break on one which eureka replaced for free and now a defective zipper which eureka sent a replacement zipper which shows they know of the problem but that did not fix the problem so now I have to send it to them to fix at my cost of shipping plus 60 dollars to fix for a life time warranty tent as zipper have no warranty which many leave me with no tent for my next event
4,Room for the Bed and my head,"Set up was pretty easy, no fights with the wife at the camp ground :) Lots of room for our Aero Bed plus room to dress and stand up. I like it."
4,Great all around tent!!,I purchased this tent to get away from the low dome type tents. My wife really didnt like to camp with me till I bought this one. We now use a raised queen inflatable mattress and still have plenty of room to spare. It has held up in wind and rain and drys fast!I would have rated this tent five stars...but i am a little dissapointed in the flooring material. It is very thin (I recommend a ground cloth/floor protector)I have heard other reviews complain about the screened roof in cooler weather conditions. I cut a heavy ground cloth into 4 triangular pieces and affixed magnets to the edges. thenI hold them in place with magnets on the inside. works great and allows me to control the venting in all weather conditions.Buy some heavy tent stakes...the ones supplied are worthless!!
5,very happy,"we bought this tent last year and used it 3 times so far. We are only 2 and the tent is big enough for us, we put our queen size bed inside and have room to walk around, my husband also fits his luggage in.The windows are big, ours doesn't have the zipper at the bottom though but didn't matter. Easy to assemble be careful when handling the poles, the elastic broke in one pole but we fixed it with no problem.We love it"
1,Poor Warranty,"I've had a Eureka tent for some time (20+ years) and I've used it about a dozen times. The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing has started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been ""stored indoors in the original bag"". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible.Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."
4,Great Book!,"I actually met and spent some time with one of the elders that this book is about. We tend to over analyze cultures and look at them through a certain ""gaze"", possibly an anthropological one. However, when we do this we overlook the brilliance in some of the aspects in cultures and specifically books, we must read against the grain. If you've never spent any time in the north or with Inuit people, it is easy to misundertsand a lot of things. It's easy for a person to write a review strictly on the book and decide from one certain perspective that it doesn't meet their needs. I think this book is great and it must be noted that some understanding of Inuit culture might help you in looking at things in a slightly different context."
5,Now this is the future of Thrash!,"I bought this cd knowing only that they supposedly sounded like Testament. and well this is the best album Testament never recorded. this has all the good elements from the melodic death metal scene and all the best elements of thrash metal. Not only does the music kill, I mean some of the best flowing songs and solos I've heard in a while. but Susperia have one of the best vocalists in the scene right now. Along with Bio-mechanical, and Nevermore, Susperia are the future of metal...and the future is looking bright."
3,for the metal heads,"Now if youre a metal head and were into the older beginnings of Susperia, then this album is not for you. All of the melodies are there, but the guitar work and growls are not. Besides the lyrics are absolutly retarded sometimes. Such as on the song ""Off The Grid"": ""Are you one of those people that still believe that unicorns still exsist, youre officially off the grid."" That just makes me laugh!This album is great, dont get me wrong, but compared to their album Prdominance, this is a peice of s***. I enjoy their older stuff more, but if youre a first time listener, listen to Predominance first, or even Vindication, which is OK.Theres better metal out there, but this album will stay in my car for those emo metal moments."
5,Possibly the best album of 2004...,"... and that's becoming a bold statement with awesome releases from God Forbid, In Flames, Fear Factory and Decapitated also vying for the title. Anyway, with Unlimited, Susperia deliver a great pure metal album reminiscent of old Metallica and Pantera. Though this might top even the best from those bands. Think very fast, hard hitting, melodic death metal mixed with the bands mentioned above with a guy who could pass as Phil Anselmo singing. Made up of people from Dimmu Borgir and Old Man's Child though this is far removed from those bands. There are no death metal vox on this album and nothing about satan on here. Everything is awesome on this album and you should buy this today if your a fan of old metal like Pantera and Metallica or are a fan of guitar. I recommend checking out Soilwork, At the Gates, Withering Surface and Meshuggah in addition to this."
5,Wow,"This is, without a doubt the best Metal album of the last few years. If you like extreme metal, with just enough melody to keep all the songs from sounding the same, this is your band. The closest I can come to describing this album is Testament ""The Gathering"" era meets a faster, heavier Opeth. The music is pounding and aggressive, but contains a fair amount of guitar melody ala Arch Enemy, but with a darker more gothic feel. They have Opeth's creepy vibe but with a much more Pantera-style hammering. The production is incredible. If you have a sub-woofer in your car, beware of the windshield. A band that can blow your head off with sheer power, while still writing memorable songs is a rare treat indeed, Old Metallica and Slayer could do it. Testament and Opeth still can, so can Susperia. Buy this thing, believe me."
2,Don't let the album cover fool you...,"Yeah, cool album cover, but the actual album is to dissapoint. Actually, the music is good...the musicians are awesome...they blend power metal with death metal kinda like Children Of Bodom. However, the vocalist is terrible!!! The singer sounds like he's the guy from Disturbed, and the lyrics are verry, verry, verry stupid...or should I say ""stupified"". This album is a capital NOT for fans of death metal. Maybe if Susperia looses this lame singer they will become something...but for now....yuck! It's pretty much just a basic radio freindly heavy metal band only without any hits."
4,Just wish it was hard cover,"I gave this book as a gift. It is beautiful. The pictures are absolutely gorgeous, and the writing is wonderful. I just wish it was hard cover."
1,Can you hear me now?,"Totally not worth it. I and 2 other colleagues at work have these and we are constantly on the verge of screaming into the headset so that our customers can hear us.Buy this if you don't mind the person on the other end of the line asking you to ""Please, speak up!"" Absolute garbage as far as I'm concerned. I've used $20 headsets that work better."
5,Good Stuff!,"These headsets are the right thing for our police department dispatch personnel. After buying three for some of them to test, the requests came rolling in from the rest of the crew. Good price from Amazon!"
2,It was great for a year,"I am the kind of person who when I spend big bucks for something, I expect it to last. This was not the case for this headset. I had this headset for just under a year. I use it daily. After five months, the mouth peice covering had fallen off. This wasn't too bad, because it was mostly cosmetic. Just last week, I had to stop using the set alltogether, because wiring in the headset had become so bad that the people on the other line were not able to hear me anymore. It would work, and then if I would move my head....it would not work anymore. I paid almost 60 dollars for this about a year ago. I LOVED it at first....but after this time.......I am very disappointed. I went to Walmart and bought a Sanyo with all the same features for 14.99. If the average life span is 1 year for this....I can buy one every year for four years for the cost of the Plantronics......Very disappointed."
4,Loved this!,"I loved the quirky characters, their interactions, and the sense of humor that shines throughout this novel. It was a good introduction to small-town life in New Mexico, and the author's love for the state is apparent. I have also read The Clovis Incident, which I liked as well, and have ordered The Socorro Blast which I hope to have in hand this week. I'll definitely keep my eyes open for future books from this writer."
4,Eureka! Copper Canyon 1312,"This is a great tent. Our family of 5 had plenty of room. Set up with my wife (new camper) went without any problems. We has room for a double portable bed on one side, and a queen air mattress for our 3 sons on the other. Lots of additional room for luggage. I'm 6'3"", and could stand up and walk around, no problem.We didn't have any rain on our trip, so I cannot comment."
3,nylon floor!,"I bought the copper canyon 1512 which is the same as all the copper canyon eureka tents-essentially just different sizes. The one HUGE complaint I have about these tents is that the floor material is the same as the tent walls and not the brown color but the light cream. Hmmm...cream colored floor while camping. Not only did the tent always look filthy but the floor was permanently stained after one camping trip. Yes, you do want a heavy duty tarp floor!"
4,Love This Tent! But What's With the Awning?,"First, let me say that our family doesn't go camping much so we're not experts with the tents. However, this is a GREAT tent for beginners; went up easily, lots of floor space, and plenty of head room. In fact, all of our expert camping friends were ooohing and ahhhing as we put up our tent.I would have given this AWESOME TENT 5 stars but I'm taking one away because of the awning! What is up with that thing? We could not figure out how to get it up! We had everybody looking at it and it didn't seem to make much sense to anybody. In fact, I noticed in all of the pictures posted, none of them show the awning. The picture on the box shows the awning poles going down to the ground being held up by nothing! This seems to be the only flaw with the tent."
4,WARNING! DO NOT USE THIS TENT WITH THE STAKES THAT ARE SHIPPED WITH IT,"As you will read in several reviews, DO NOT use the stakes that are sent with this tent. I did during my inital setup in my yard and ended up with a shredded tent that blew away after steady winds. I can not understand how Eureka can sell their tents with these stakes. They are simple smooth wire 1/8"" diameter metal and will not hold your tent down in wind. Make sure you purchase good quality (even the plastic ones at Walmart are okay) stakes and tie the tent down as suggested. Again, several hundred dollars for a tent and they can't provide proper stakes?So I purchased a new rain fly for about 88 bucks from Eureka, patched the holes in the screen and will say I love the tent, just a shame it doesnt look very new!"
3,The view from a distance vs the other side...,"Very enlightening. However, the author is higly disillusioned about his past faith, although he is still a believer. I would recommend reading Bishop Shelby Spong's works: they are less pessimistic."
5,Life's Greatest Lessons,"If you loved this book another great book is Life's Greatest Lessons: 20 Things That Matter by Hal Urban. Orginally titled 20 Things I Want My Kids To Know, it was originally published in 1992 and is now in the Fourth Edition, and it won Best Self-Published Inspirational Book of the Year 2000 by Writer's Digest Magazine.It also was written for his children and other people of all ages. It talks about the wisdom of the ages and other life lessons and truths we do not learn in school about how life works and character education for kids, teachers and parents.It is sure to be a classic that will enrich everyone's life and should be in every home."
4,Crude death from Puerto Rico,I really don't have so much to say about Serpenterium except that these latin pioneers really live up to their word. After purchasing this album I realized that Puerto Rico has what it takes to put a lot of the Swedish bands in the dust.Also check out more Puerto Rican death such as Godless and Sacrifice.Great job for Serpenterium. Now let's work on a front cover that will attract more eyes.
2,Re-recorded versions of songs,"This was originally released on cassette after Del Shannon died. It has two of his songs ""Runaway"" and ""Hats Off To Larry"". These are not the K-tel versions but better sounding true stereo re-recordings. The songs besides the above two which are also re-recordings are""Corinna, Corinna"" (Ray Peterson), ""Sea Cruise"" (Frankie Ford), ""Rockin' Robin"" (Bobby Day), ""Go, Jimmy, Go"" (Jimmy Gilmer) -originally a hit for Jimmy Clanton, I'm not sure who is singing this version-, ""This Diamond Ring"" (Gary Lewis), ""Charlie Brown"" (The Coasters), ""Sugar Shack"" (Jimmy Gilmer). Nowhere on this CD does it say they're re-recordings."
4,4 Original Dragnet TV Classic Episodes In EP Mode,This VHS set is composed of 2 video tapes and 4 episodes. The tapes are recorded in EP mode by Madacy Music Group. They are the original Dragnet shows in B&W.; Episodes included:1. Big Deal2. Big Net3. Big Crime4. Big Lift
1,Not much here,I'm not sure what the purpose of this book is. It is way too sketchy to be a biography & too chear-leaderish to be taken seriously.
1,Once again disappointing,"Ladislas Farago has written considerably better books on Patton, and this book cannot hold a candle to those books, on which the academy award winning movie 'Patton' was based.Charles Province, a self-proclaimed 'expert' on Patton, has founded the Patton Society on the Internet in which, for a sizeable contribution, you can have a rank in his 'club'. This book really reveals nothing that other books on Patton don't. Province once again tends to idolize Patton and it shows."
2,is ok,"Good material, you just have to be able to understand the technique that they are trying to describe. I would not recommend for untrained people. I shouldn't recommend for trained individuals but its a good desk reference for those whose training has lapsed."
3,reminds me of aikido,"Not many photos or techniques.I expected lots of photographs and lots of techniques as in every other book I had previously bought in Amazon.However, as I have looked at it deeper and due to training, I realised that to teach self defense you may not need to put lots of techniques into your arsenal, but those you may apply at any moment or situation.I now find this book much more interesting and valuable than 3 years ago. Not lots of techniques, but you may not need many of them.All you need is to practise a lot the ones collected in this book so you can apply them well from any position, as aikido people pretend to do."
4,Unique but incomplete,"I am a translator of the Old Testament. I found this book unique of its kind, and very helful for my work. I did't find another similar work. It is a good work. The Hebrew words are written above in every entry and are proceeded the Greek words of the Septuagint. The Greek words are also keyed to the classic Hatch-Redpath Concordance. But I would be more satisfied if there were keyed also with the Strong's numbering system. I think that this is a deficiency of the book. The size of the letters is also small. I would prefer it larger. But generally the work is good, and deserves its price!"
3,Congoleum Advantage vinyl tile ZPV-14,"I installed these tiles on my kitchen floor 9 years ago.It looks very nice, but don't use where heavy traffic.It wears very fast."
4,Moving,"I came to appreciate the difficulties of being an honest and good NYPD cop.This book helped me realize that all the heroic things cops do are ignored by the media, while the few mistakes are constantly highlighted.Since 9/11 the media and the liberal left have improved somewhat, but not enough.The courage and selflessness required to be a NYPD cop are amazing. While the NYPD is not above criticism, I think much of the criticism is misplaced, misleading and a result of misunderstanding.I dare Al Sharpton to read this book -- maybe it could expand his world view a little bit more."
2,Too much politics,"I was disappointed in the book. Unless you are interested in the political history of the area as it relates to the police department, you will probably be bored. It needed way more cop stories."
4,Worth the investment,"This book may be very tricky for someone who has not a background in finance or economics. The content is very condensed but sometimes quite pleasant to read (the authors have a good sense of humor...)According to me, they give a good overview of the financial industry in a structured way. Moreover, this book is extensively used by the top business schools. I'm an Harvard grad this book is also used at MIT Sloan.This is definitely not a practical book. You need first to digest the content and read it again and again.I would say that the CD-rom attached to it is useless..."
4,Must Have for Business School Students,"This is the main text used in most of the top undergraduate business programs in the US. Now in its 7th edition, Brealey and Myers still do a good job updating their already thick book to include new and relevant topics. I have read the 5th and 6th editions too, and they were fine books. The books are written for a general audience, and requires only a basic background in accounting. The rest of the material is pretty self-contained, but the treatment of some topics is quite shallow. I like the capital budgeting part of this book, as it provides a very good discussion on the subject matter."
4,Course Material,"This book was assigned to me to support Myers's finance class. It is a difficult book to read on one's own. The book is a great reference if you are already taking a course on finance or already have some academic background. However, if you are determined to gain a solid knowledge of finance then this is the right reference. The book gives excellent examples of financial decisions from real life and draws particular attention to mistakes managers regularly make. A must read if you are trying to catch up with MBA material on your own."
3,Not for beginners !!,"Studied this in Corporate Finance class in MBA - instructor was a big fan of this book and mentioned it is directed to beginners. Once I start reading the book, language is good but the structure and the layout of the chapters are extremely bad. Get a book on the basics and dont take this book as the only resource for your corporate finance studies."
3,Dry but useful,"This is a well-written book and useful, especially in understanding legal requirments of fiduciaries. However, for a tour de force of writing and exposition on ethical theory and practices in business, see Berumen's Do No Evil."
2,Impossible to read,"True, I am not a business school student, I am just brushing up on Finance for an actuarial exam. But I am no dummy I tell you, I can read almost anything, and this book I cannot read. If you are looking to get a quick grasp on Corporate Finance, this book is not for you. It is incredibly long and verbose. You skip from one topic to the next without seeing how they interconnect. This is one book where one can read fifteen chapters and still not know a single thing."
1,A Miserable Excuse for a Textbook,"Perhaps for finance graduate students this book is appropriate but for the rest of us reasonably intelligent folks this book makes no sense at all.Simple concepts should be explained and then used as building blocks for more complex ones; this book starts complex, the authors then rant about whatever they like or don't like, and then go on to something else even more complex. All the while leaving the reader befuddled about what these guys were talking about in the first place.I suspect they're doing some grandstanding, trying to impress us with their intelligence. All right I'm impressed, now how about teaching me finance?Professors, have mercy on your students. Use a text that offers clarity and supplements classroom lectures; this book does neither."
3,Not a book for Finance newcomers,"This book is good, but only for people who know at least some Finance before they read it. Believe me, I have taken Corporate Finance at the MBA level before, it's not an easy book to read."
1,Poorly written book - will not recommend,"This book is very difficult to understand even with a basic background in finance and economics. There is no structure, no clear definitions or definitions at all. I do not understand why the majority of instructors chose this text. There even are errors in the solutions for the practice questions."
2,Book ...,"This books [is bad] primarily because it is called ""Principles of Corporate Finance"". This is NOT AN INTRO book to finance. An intro book would have spent more time going over basic concepts like balance sheets and income statement. Also the sample problems at times can be really hard to follow. I highly recommend using Fundamentals of Corporate Finance by Ross, Westerfield, and Jordan as a supplement to this if you have no finance background."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my son, who loves snowmobiles and Bob the Builder. I thought this would be great. It wasn't. Scrambler and Zoomer behave horribly through most of the movie only to come to their senses towards the end of the movie. It's too much bad behavior to watch again."
1,poor book,"Nihil novi sub sole. Everybody could give advices like those included in this book. And the funny thing is: according to author, do not attempt to use those exercises if you cannot benchpress 185lbs. (for men). Phew! Very extreme workout, indeed!"
3,As others have said,"As others have said, this book is a reference book. You cannot sit down and read it per say. It has a lot of information but for a novice trying to use it to even identify an engraving it was hard for me using the books, ""walk through"". Some of the pictures appear to be hand drawn and are very very close to each other so you can't really decided if what you have is A or B."
3,What Episodes Are Being Offered?,It would be nice to know specifically what episodes are being offered.Don't want to buy the same ones I already have.
4,Good product,"The product is really good. I use it every time after I do a long run and it works really well.The only problem i see, is that the gel gets warm pretty fast, but it's enough time. Moreover,they send you two gels, then you can replace it. In summary It's an excellent product for this price."
1,Wrong Product - Good Condition,"This item came and was the Alstott in the white jersey. The listing specifically says red jersey. The item was in good condition, but it is the wrong item. I already have a white jersey, so this will be returned."
5,Just what every mom needs!!,This is a great video! It is short and to the point while working all the major muscle groups. I could feel the results after the first workout. With it being only about 20 min it makes it so much easier to fit a great workout into your day.
4,Mini Fluted Tube pan,The pans were as expected. They were nice size and the cakes were easilyremoved and in good form.
5,great pan,I love this pan. It makes beautiful looking mini cakes and they come out of the pan very easily.
3,Pan is fine but damn that label!,Pan works fine and all. Feels well made but why must they use 2 pounds of super glue to put a label over the pan. Tried everything to scrape it off with no luck.
5,Classic,Excellent cerebral pop for the self-effacing sarcastic music lover. Wouldn't part with my copy for anything.
2,Shipping costs more than the item.,"My kid loved it, so I don't have a complaint about the toy. But its shipping cost was more than the toy's cost. Moreover it shipped from a third party which delayed it."
4,Fun sword,Nice little sword. Makes noise and changes 3 colors which the boys absolutely love. In a house full of toy weaponry this is one of the favorites.
2,"Good recorder, Obsolete software","This recorder has good sound quality. However, it comes with version 7 of Dragon Naturally Speaking, instead of version 8, which has been on sale for over a year now. The new version is much more accurate; the old version produces a lot more errors, and correcting them is tedious and time-consuming. I would wait until Sony starts packaging the unit with the current software."
4,Good Service,I received the book reasonably quickly and the book was in good quality. Would buy from this seller again!
4,Walther PPK 7.65mm. Delivery like a brick through a plate glass window.,I really enjoy this replica. It is definitely not a toy. I bought one and played with it too much. The metal wire inside that allows the hammer to cock and release with the trigger broke. I bought another one and have been much more careful with it. It is a beautiful replica. It's as heavy as the real thing.A must for any James Bond fan.
5,Absolutely the best reference for programmers new to Perl,"I am not new to programming, but was new to Perl when I took a job that required a ton of pattern matching based scripting. I immediately convinced my boss to buy a bunch of Perl books, including this one. Usually, I am the type to use Google more than any book when learning a new language, but this book has been indispensible. I go to it first anytime I want to know how to do something in Perl, and 9 times out of 10 it is the only resource I need. I agree with other reviewers that this is not the book for beginning programmers, but I could have saved my boss a lot of money had I just had her buy me this one. It's all I've needed."
2,A good book to make one frustrated,"Hello Everyone,I dont have any good comments to make about this book. I read this book and at the end couldn't summarize what I learnt. It only left me with confusion and questions. The language seems cryptic and sentences are convolved. I guess this is the book for Perl experts and not for someone who truly wants to learn the language. And I bet, its gonna create some confusions in an expert mind as well. To summarize, dont waste your money."
3,I sold my book back,"The humor was too much for me. I tried to be calm and focus on learning Perl. But I gave up after three chapters. The authors take it too casually like a walk in the park, and try strange attempts too seriously to compare Perl with english language. I sold my book back on Amazon and lost nearly 20 dollars in the bargain. But still give it 3 stars because there are sure people who like to do things the light way. As for me, I like books who talk sense, I dont have time to waste reading jokes and silly footnotes."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"I think the real reason Larry Wall wrote this book was just to brag about his baby creation. 80-90% of this book is just Larry going on and on about how Perl is the greatest language ever because it loosely models human languages. The real content of this book is so watered down it's as if O'Reilly told Wall, ""Sorry, 200 pages is too short, try to go for 1000 so we can sell the book for [price] rather than $30.""Larry should take a note from Dennis Ritchie(the creator of C) and his book ""The C Programming Language"". Ritchie DOESN'T go on and on about how he's the greatest genius in the world and how C is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Ritchie's book is 250 pages and documents EVERY TINY DETAIL of the C language. It takes Larry 1000 pages to do the same for Perl, a MUCH simpler language. That's just sad."
3,I should have believed other reviews,"I thought the language's original creator has to have some deeper insight to share. Instead I got too much not so funny humor instead. It is pretty complete for everything you want to look up for, but that is all that may be worth something."
5,"Excellent book, a true classic","This is an excellent book and not just the best book to learn Perl with but also a true showpiece of technical writing. This takes a slightly unconventional approach compared to other Perl books you may find and some may find that it focuses on obscure language features a tad too much.But all that is more than made up for in the way it covers the Perl philosophy, culture and it's overall style and tone. It is not often that you find yourself laughing out loud while reading a programming language book.Highly recommended."
2,The author talks too much,"I had read only 5 chapters and didn't tolerate it anymore. The author talks too much.. each 10 lines he wrote anything about his life. I had gotten nervous. Buy it by a humour book, dont a programming book."
2,"bible, sure, but over-rated","I guess I just prefer a book better from someone who DIDN'T invent the language. That is, a book from another perspective seems to point out the idiosyncracies of a language, etc. The only chapter of this book that I use is the 200 page one on Functions which, as its name implies, lists every Perl function and a basic couple of paragraphs about using that function. I've used Perl for years, but only resort to O'Reilly when I'm desperate. I expected a lot more from a book that is so well know.While not nerely as comprehensive, I prefer the book Cross-Platform Perl. I guess it's more of a tutorial (probably similary to O'Reilly Learning Perl).Only get this book if you're looking for a reference and already know perl. If you're looking for a book that will both teach you the language and serve as a reference after that, I'd avoid this one."
3,It really isn't that good,"The book is written by the creators of Perl, but the truth is that the book is not nearly as good as it's cracked up to be. It suffers from the ""fish describing water"" syndrome, where the authors find it hard to know what to talk about and what not to talk about.The book definitely is useful, but it's not as useful as a book written by more skillful technical writers would have been. It's very ""ivory towers"" and it badly needs more simple example scripts rather than ""head in the clouds"" discussions.Unfortunately a lot of people who want to be ""macho"" about computers will say that this book is much easier to understand and useable than it really is - they'd probably tell you about how wonderful the emperor's new clothes are too.It's not a bad book, and it's definitely useful, but I'd recommend borrowing a copy of this book to have a good look at it before buying it."
4,This is the Meat and Potatoes of Perl,"I really enjoyed this book. I have a limited knowledge of Perl, yet Larry Wall has a way of describing the language that is informative and instructional without trying to be cute or overly simplistic. I found that everything in this book was useful and very informative. This book explains how to use and program such things as loop statements, passing references in subroutines, as well as a section on common practices showing common goofs of novices as well as other beneficial information to make your scripts better.If you are looking for a book that will give you more of the meat and potatoes of Perl, instead of leading you by the hand, this book is what you want."
3,you have to put up with a lot of annoying chattter,"It is a good book and you can learn a lot. However, the ""comedy,"" which is really just a lot of annoying chatter, get in the way a great deal."
2,oreily perl book,"NOT FOR THE BEGINNER TO PERL!!!! I have spent 3 days with this book and do not know much more that i did 4 days ago about perl. It is way over my head and i am a VB programmer. The book is well written for an advanced user, but that wasn't/isn't me."
3,"its ok, not the best though","The book was just ok, and not the best though, I expected it to be much nicer"
4,Good book if you can get past the language.,"Make no mistake about it, this is the Best book to learn to Program Perl. It teaches you the Language in the best manner and teaches you what Perl is which is - There is more than one way to do it.But the problem is the writing which is a bit boring and confusing.It will take some effort on your part but once you ignore that it is a Great Book No doubt about it."
2,Very complicated book,"Though I have a lot of programming experience, this book really got me confused. This author jumps ahead with each page leaving the readers perplexed. There are no examples showing what the commands, functions are supposed to mean."
4,"A Complete Reference, But Not For Beginners","Programming Perl, also known as ""The Camel Book,"" is the ultimate reference guide, written by the creator of Perl, Larry Wall. As one might expect, this guide covers every nook and cranny of the Perl programming language. It's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness: useful nuggets of information are buried everywhere throughout the text. This is a strength in that, when looking up a particular topic, you'll often stumble upon a useful morsel of information. It's a weakness in that you have to slog through often dry reading to find these hidden gems.It should be noted that this book assumes a working knowledge of Unix, in addition to some previous programming experience. If you are new to programming, or just new to Perl, you should check outLearning Perl, Fourth Editioninstead. It is a much easier read, and ranks in my mind among the most well written technical books. Programming Perl makes for a great second book, as well as a desktop reference."
4,Programming Perl,"This is THE BOOK. If you need to learn perl, this books explains all the insides of the language. The book will explain why everything is the way it is in perl. Now, if you are looking for examples to practice, you should get Learning Perl. You can read both books simultaneously."
3,"Great as reference, terrible for learning","I will keep this book for reference, but will go find another one in order to learn. They take a 'bottom-up' approach and start with ALL the detail. So if you just want simple examples to start with, you are stuck. You must read for hours to figure out anything. Instead of starting with easy stuff and building up, they just jump right in with all the way cool tricky stuff. As a reference book, it will be excellent."
5,The Bible,"I wouldn't say this is simple the Perl bible, but the Bible itself! I mean, it only covers Perl, but it should be used as an example for all books.It covers every nook and cranny of perl, from regular expressions, to object-oriented perl, to obscure overloading procedures. It even has a (brief) section on Perl Poetry.Not to mention, Larry Wall's writing style is that of a true genius. It's flowing and easy to read, and f**king hilarious! If you're a programmer but not interested in perl, look at a friend's copy of this book just for the wonderfully funny footnotes.I recommend this for a programmer with at least one language of background. That or experience with BASIC (seeing as how I said 'language'). Even if you don't have interest in Perl, start reading, and I assure you, you will."
2,"big book, lots of material, but a tough read","I'm not all that enamored with this book. I have many years of programming experience in various languages, and even with that background this book is difficult to follow. The author keeps making idiotic comparisons between ""natural, spoken language"" and PERL syntax. To me that just takes up space and isn't useful at all. Then when he discusses important concepts which differ from other languages (e.g. the way PERL handles variables), I find his explanations difficult to follow.Surely there must be better books than this!"
2,Poorly written disappointment,"You get the impression that Larry Wall thinks he's one clever author. But his writing style get tedious really quickly and is mostly a waste of paper. Well, I do like the regular expression section, but other than that, I would say skip this book. I recommend the Learning Perl along with the Perl Cookbook."
2,Step down from Leaning Perl 2nd edition,"This book is good neither for learning nor for reference while Learning Perl 2nd edition was well suitable for both. Too many words, too little sense which, on top of that, is well hidden. Unless you want to support authors financially, don't buy it."
2,Senseless book,"I bought this book, and believe me, it's a waste of money!!! I thought the book was great, but it has no sense at all. It has a total of 0 examples, it's about 1,000 pages and each command is learned separately, which has no sense at all. You cannot learn from this book, i assure you guys!!!."
5,Definitive manual for Perl,"If you are programming in Perl, this is a required book to have. It is the definitive manual on the language written by the author of the language, yet is very readable."
5,Universally Regarding as the Bible of Perl,"This is THE book for perl, plain and simple. I've seen people refered to specific page numbers in this book on IRC when they have Perl questions. If you do any significant amount of Perl programming then you really should get this."
3,Not as informative as you might think,"Despite being written by the language's creator, this book is not as informative as you might think. It is very verbose, but it's structured so poorly that it's not suitable as a tutorial nor as a reference.Don't get me wrong. I love using Perl, and this book is very interesting at times because Larry Wall is an interesting guy. But the discussion is a little dithering and philosophical.It also has very few example programs. The book recommends that you use _Perl Cookbook_ (from the same publisher) as a companion. While _Perl Cookbook_ is a very good book, it's kind of silly to buy two books if you just want to learn intermediate Perl concepts.As an alternative to _Programming Perl_, I highly recommend _Intermediate Perl_ from the same publisher (it has an alpaca on the cover). _Intermediate Perl_ is more concise; more informative; better structured; and has more examples."
1,Wrong Item Shipped,The company sent a different brand of the item they advertised. I called the company to tell them we received something different and they said that brand was no longer in stock. I asked them to please remove that item so other buyers don't think that is available too.
1,cheap,this item is cheaply made..my daughter will not even wear it. I tried multiple times to contact seller to return it ..only to get no answer.
2,no suction power,"while it's nice and portable it pales in comparison to the medela double pump, it takes twice as long to get the same amount of milk and who wants to spend any more time pumping than absolutely necessary?"
4,Awesome product,"I bought the Avent Isis iQ last month because I decided to start donating my breastmilk to babies in need. I had previously been using the Avent Isis manual, which I also liked but I wanted something a little more efficient. It's so nice to be able to do something other than just sit while pumping and no more hand cramps! It does take me longer to pump than with the manual, but I get a lot more using the iQ- my first time using it I got 2oz more than normal. Well worth the price."
4,Better than the rest,I used a Medela Hospital rental ($50+ a month!!!) when i realized it would be cheaper to BUY this one. I really like it. It is MUCH better than the hard plastic Medela. I find the comfort 'cushion' a must have. I use it occasionally and haven't had any suction issues. I have no idea how well it would hold up if used everyday but it does come with extra seals to maintain suction (and you can order more). The ONLY reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because I use it only occasionally (1-2 times a week) so I'm not sure about it's durability.
2,sucky pump,"this is a sucky pump... a waste of money. the electronic part of this pump sucks, i could barely pump enough. but they give you a conversion kit that lets you turn it into a manual pump that works well. the manual pump is just tiring to use. spend your money elsewhere!!! this pump is a waste of time!!!!"
1,Hated it!,This pump was a very painful experience for me and the silicone inserts which are supposed to add comfort stuck to my very sensitive breasts and peeled at the skin when I would remove the pump from my breast. I took the pump with me on my visit to the lactation consultant who said I was doing everything properly but that the pump was just not working with my breasts. It is also very difficult to dissasemble and clean. I would defenitely not recommend this product.
3,"Okay buy, but should have researched more","This pump is great, although they make it sound so much better! Everything worked correctly and efficiently but the Avent bottles that you have to use with it tend to leak (all of them, it's not just a fluke!). I bought the 4oz and 9oz bottles and milk storage bottles, the pump, etc and for the price of everything.. I really wish I would have spent the time to reseach other systems. It is definetly not worth the price you pay. And you CANNOT switch out with other bottles. When I started using the bottles when my baby was about 3-4 weeks old I found that he was swallowing a lot of air and the latch on was not so easy for him.. he had a very hard time switching from bottle to breast. I have since had much better luck with another brand of bottle."
2,pretty shoes but!!,"Look just like photo, pretty shoes, but are no where near sized right! I order a half size bigger just in case and there is no way it was a 8.5M more like a 7.5 M. but time you pay to send back, not worth it in cost.barbara"
2,NOT first quality!,"Was excited to receive this pan and expected a first quality product. However, as soon as I took the pan out of the box, I noticed a huge area that looked defective/unfinished/splotchy. My husband immediately noticed, too. He rarely notices things like that, so for him to notice, the problem has to be very obvious! Tried washing the pan to see if there was just something on the surface. Nope. Defective area was still here. So it must be a defect in the surface itself.The defective area is very large, about the size of my two fists combined. An inspector should have seen this defect. It should never have been sold as a first quality item.I expected better from Nordic Ware. Very disappointed. :("
2,"Ok, but warped after a couple of uses.","Very heavy duty aluminum, but the bottom warped - the pan will spin like a top on the bulge that developed in the center of the bottom. I had been careful not to overheat the pan or subject it to sudden temperature changes, so I am somewhat disappointed."
2,NOT Stainless Steel,"Although the product description does say this is made of aluminum, I did not read it carefully enough and bought this product after searching for ""Stainless Steel Baking Sheet"". I will be returning it."
5,completely functional,"the right size and a nice weight, hasn't warped yet. what's not to love about a new baking pan? buy it.."
3,Baker Sheet - Dont use sharp objects,"Sheet worked great for the first couple times. Be careful using any sharp objects though. A family member used a pizza cutter on the surface of the sheet and now a very noticeable line is on the Sheet. Worse, is that you can actually feel the cut, it is not just a surface thing."
5,nordic ware,Had some racks that needed a bigger pan. Have nordic ware already so I new these would be of good quality and made in USA. Do not twist when heated on high heat. Will last a life time.
5,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for more pans to use for baking cookies, since I make quite a few batches for Christmas. I found this pan and ordered one to try with the silicone baking sheets and I loved it so much I ordered a second pan. I don't think I will ever go without. I have also used for baking rolls and they came out so much better than on the nonstick dark pan. I would highly recommend this pan."
3,Requires Longer Baking Time,"This product is sturdy, and cleans well, but it requires a longer baking time than most other cookie sheets that I've used. Used in combination with other sheets, you have to time the baking time separately, which is rather inconvenient. Because our other sheets were old and blackened, we opted to buy another of these to use when baking cookies, and are able to adjust the cooking time for the pans, but I avoid using this when I am using new recipes, because the times provided will underestimate."
3,Description misleading,I Thought I was ordering an all stainless steel pan. It is not. Amazon made it right with me which is why I like shopping here. I gave the pan To my son.
2,Disappointed!,Haven't use this product yet but was disappointed because when I took the cellophane off there were already scratches on the sheet.
2,All that gray stuff?,"Was just looking for stainless items and noticed your ""gray"" matter. Have to tell you ,that is aluminum. Stainless doesn't leach like that and you are eating that too! Look in the description of that baking sheet.It's aluminum."
3,Nordict pan,I am happy with this pan but I do have some words of caution. Only use plastic scrubbers on it or you WILL wear of the non stick coating.I own two but we almost ruined one by not cleaning it properly.
5,Cookie sheet pan (Cookie Momster Likes),When we recieved the package it was obvious it was better than most pans because it was sturdy and not flexible like most you see in the stores. It was wrapped great and it shipped fast.... We could have had the cookies setting out when we ordered because it seems like thay came overnight.... Very happy with this and would recommend to anyone because of the quality and performace...
5,Fantastic Pan!,"I love this pan! It is sturdy and durable, cleans fairly easy, not flimsy like some other brands, but not so thick that if effects the cooking of the food."
3,"Generous size, but not as heavy or solid as I'd expected","The half sheet size is useful when you need a bit of extra space, and the rims on these sheets are reinforced to deter warping and twisting. But the aluminum is thinner and lighter than I had expected for this size baking sheet. It's okay, but I would not rush out to buy it again when there are heavier-weight more industrial-strength options available from other manufacturers like WearEver."
5,Best baking sheets. period.,"These baking sheets are heavy duty, take a licking, and stay in excellent shape. I have had a few things overflow and burn on these, add a little Barkeeprs friend and warm water take it all off quite easily. I always use Silpats (which fit perfectly end-to-end) to keep them clean. I've had my set of two for about 3 years now and just ordered another two (with silpats) as a Christmas gift that I'm sure any cook would enjoy.Very durable, High Quality, Definately recommended."
4,Does what it says,"I love the size of this sheet pan but it does scratch very easily. Cleaning some of the gummed on, hardened items is difficult. Works great with the criss-crossed wiring for draining all fat from meats while baking and also great for hand-breading your own foods."
2,It's a baking sheet,"When I wash my pan, my sponge is covered with grey residue and there is grey residue in the sink. Manufacturer refuses to address this problem. Happens every time although the pan is shiny and clean before I use it."
3,Dented because of Packaging,"I received this item today, as a highly reviewed item I thought it would make a great addition to my kitchen. However after opening the package as packed with a skillet I ordered, the skillet had dented and partially damaged the bakers pan. Not that it's entirely a big deal, I feel as though there was no thought of packaging these items today. Disappointed that it arrived as it did."
2,Disappointed,I bought this a couple of days ago I have not used it yet. It has four dents in it when it arrived. In order to see the dents i had to open it and take the paper off of it. Wanted to send it back but Iam not going to because I dont want to pay for shipping again. I think it will be alright to cook on it with the dents in it but not happy.
2,Not Worth Owning!,"The filmmakers claim this is based upon the orginal movie, ""The Exorcist"" but I cannot see how this can be. I never heard of a priest going to kill himself during an exorcism in order to save the person who has the devil driven from them. I think a lot of things were made up. The acting is poor and even the effects are too. No one ever found the other dead teenage girl who killed herself. The script needed work. Linda Blair has nothing to worry about."
1,One star for some acting,"I give this one a single star just because the women playing Gail and her sister are pretty good.As for the rest, it claims to be based on the story that inspired the Exorcist, but that is not necessarily accurate. Also, the production quality is horrible and the exorcism sequences go on and on and on and just become tedious more than frightening."
2,Overpriced movie!!!!,"Amazon/CDnow is asking over $20 for this movie? No way! The acting, the effects and even the script is all poorly done. Portions of this movie do not make much sense. I rented it using a freebie coupon at my local video store. Glad it was not a paid rental. If someone ever does a redo of this movie, I hope they redo it with better actors, better effect and much better written script."
3,Good for the traveller,"This book may be good for the traveller. Looking at old Finnish books and trying to figure out the captions under the pictures is a challenge with this dictionary. Also, translating internet Finnish writings is very difficult."
1,Wow . . .,"The author's thesis, quite simply, is that images affect people in powerful ways. Apparently no one has ever noticed this before. Shockingly, the image's power has something to do with the fact that it is accessible to visual perception. Images have a magical presence that previous scholars have simply ignored, denied, repressed, dismissed as mere superstition, or explained in aesthetic terms (aesthetics is bad for some reason)."
4,Lots of fun but one drawback,"We really love this game and so we were eager to buy the expansion decks. Unfortuantely, there are repeats in the various expansion decks making you feel a little cheated. There are an endless supply of nouns and adjectives so there is no legitimate reason for the repeats. Otherwise, a great game."
4,Good for Seniors,I plan to use this game in a Workshop on Intergenerational Communication I am designing.
3,Ok but not worth the extra money,This is a very user friendly piece. The only thing I have against it is that I can't tell a very big difference between this one and a cheaper one. I'd save the extra $100 bucks and go a little cheaper.
5,Delivery,"The service that the company provided was so unique that ewerything else is in the shadow.I was wery happy to receive the metal detector but it is not as easy to use as advertised, but imstill learning.Might be (surely my fault).I will not buy anything from anybody else after my experience of this seller.Thank you again."
5,had it a week made about 30 bucks from it....,just take your time with it...be patient treat as a hobby that pays i recommend getting a small garden shovel and a hand sifter and one of those pin pointers..it pays to go to the high end areas use common since with it....
3,Good but not great,"Now before i start, i must say i am a garret fan (i have a Pro-Pointer AT PRO and AT GOLD and Ace 250) let me also start by saying this is a good machine for the price,However this lack of a VID and IMO the belltones are pretty annoying,i have used this machine for over a month and i have found a 1962 Silver DIME!but however one of the drawbacks of this machine is i was getting small pieces of foil registering at 25c and 10c so that was a little disappointing to dig 4+ inches and find a small piece of foil,i have a little trouble with the pinpointing feature on this machine,but however this is a great machine for hitting coins in the yard or park,but i do prefer the Fisher F-2 over this machine any day,the F-2 is such a great machine so give the F2 a try the 250 is good but the F2 is great."
4,very good tool,"We have really enjoyed using this detector. We have found several items in our yard, it takes a little bit of time getting adjusted to the sounds but once done it is great!"
3,Not better then average,"Not bad for a first detector,very easy to operate but impossible to descriminate a pull tad from a gold ring so expect to dig out your share of pull tabs, coin shooting seems good for americam coins only, a Canadian dime i identified as foil, depth indicator is so so, the tracker IV is as good of a machine for 100$ less."
3,Customer Service?,"It seems to work as advertized. When I first got it, I left 2 messages on Garrett's answering machine, 2 days apart, asking them to call me, as I had a question about the wrist strap and how it worked. No one ever returned my call.Other than that, it seems well-built."
3,You get what you pay for.!!,"What I have read here I see that my old (W) was worth every penny!!But at 600+ I never had a faulty reading. Now here in tx I had some ??Readings but , in Nc worked. But will not get a a cheap one .a lot of diggingIs not fun!!!"
1,"Bioshock, antishock","This program never ran for me, even though I have the state of the art cpu and video card. The mouse never worked, customer support never got back to me, and a new mouse didn't make a difference. I returned the game to Amazon for a refund."
1,Will not work with ATI video cards!,"I have a recent ATI Radeon video card in my Dell XPS gaming system and this game would not run until I searched and located a ""hack"". Even then, very poor performance and artifacts everywhere. Exclusivity agreement with Nivdia? Maybe.LOL, see it's down to $14.99 now. Still overpriced, IMO...Didn't know about the DRM thing -- great, now I have to go scrub my registry...STAY AWAY."
1,limited activation,"I played this game on my friend's Xbox 360 and LOVED it. It was innovative, creative and wicked fun. It's not every day you find a game that is genuinely new after you've played a lot of games. The plot was well done, the graphics wonderfully creepy, and the weapons cool. I was looking to buy this game for the PC since I don't have a 360, and am utterly disappointed that the game is DRM. It has limited activation. If I pay for a game, CD, DVD or what ever, I should be able to install it where I want when I want. You can't play it without the CD, so what's the problem? The only people this DRM process punishes are the honest consumers who purchase original copies like I do. I would give it zero stars if I could, that's how much DRM irritates me."
2,basically you are renting this for $50,2 installs means no reformatting no installing it on your future computers i think 360 owners should go with that version as i have both but have yet to install this on my pc i will play the 360 version because i feel like i actually own what i paid for and the 2 stars is for each install if i ever bother
1,My computer won't play game,Not happy at all got the whole game downloaded and now it won't work on my system so I wouldn't recommend to anyone
2,BIOSHOCK .,BIOSHOCK IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE AND UNDERSTAND AND PLAY. HE GETS STUCK IN A ROOM FILLED WITH FIRE AND CAN'T ESCAPE.
3,"Intense game, gets old though",This game was a lot of fun the first time through but even toward the end I started getting tire of it. I like that they added choices and consequences but that was only to a limited extent. I thought the graphics could have been better too. I'll stick to Doom 3.
2,"Had promise, but not very fun to play.","This game would have been fun had the developers placed more ammo around the levels and perhaps put some thought into the story line and installation. Seriously, why would a single player only game need a long, difficult affirmation process just to install the f*****? I had fun with this... for a while, until the game just decided to not use sound anymore (I still don't know why or how this happened). Eventually, I lost interest.Gunplay 2.5 stars (out of 5)Grahics 3.5 stars Come on 2k, its 2008!Story 2.0 stars Boss battle after boss battle, whoopee."
3,BioHype,"I read all the reviews and couldn't wait to play it. I thought I'd love this game, but I didn't. The graphics are phenomenal, but the game play itself is mediocre at best. Please download the demo before you purchase the game. I know a lot of folks praised this shooter, but to me it was nothing but a lot of eye candy."
1,DRM needs to be protested,"Just as everyone else is saying, the console version for this game was great. When I bought the PC version, I was distressed to learn that I could only install in 3 times. This is not worth your money, we must protest DRM in PC games."
1,"Over-hyped, overrated, lousy tech support. Don't buy it!","The game is so unplayable that it really isn't worth your time. The game play is so fractured by crashes that you can never get into it. I don't have the most powerful system and graphics card. However, I do have way more than the minimum system requirements that 2K demanded. Even people with totally loaded game boxes are frustrated.To ad insult to the whole miserable experience, 2K support is virtually nonexistent. They have stonewalled every request for a patch status. I can't remember running into many companies that treat the customers so shabbily. Save your money until you hear that a 100% working patch has been released to address the multitude of show-stopper problems that exist now."
3,"Awesome action, sound and graphics, but at a cost!","This is an incredible game with stunning graphics, sound, and playability. Multiple difficulty levels, ability to save anywhere in the game, a cool story, sets and characters.However, even though my system met or exceeded all the requirements, I could not play the game when I installed it.I had onboard sound and a GeForce 7600 GS, but neither of these could handle the game. I upgraded to a SoundBlaster Xtreme Gamer and a GeForce 7950 GT, and now the game screams; but it cost me $300 to get there. :( Still, it has a memory leak somewhere and locks up randomly. A good idea is to stop every so often and reboot.It takes FOREVER to load (seriously, like 3 or 4 MINUTES), but once loaded, you can play for a long time before you need to load again.I know there are people out there who are afraid of SecuROM, but it hasn't given me any trouble that I know of.So if you think your PC can handle it, you will most likely enjoy it."
4,bioshock is great,"Bio Shock is simply one of the best games i have ever played(and i have p;ayed at lot). There is everything u want in this game, entrig,ation,a little comdey and lots of fun. You never know whats around the corner. The story line is simple yet complex. It seams like it keeps changing depending on what you do. i highly recommend this game to anyone."
5,Outstanding Originality and Fun!!!,"I'm an avid PC gamer so I know a decent game when I come accross it. This game is a fantastic single-player FPS adventure. The theme, storyline, atmosphere, player interactions, choices, and pure mastery completely place the player in this obscure, underwater realm. I dare not speak any further of the plot as I can make an analogy of this game to a really great book! The level of creativity, detail and originality in this game will likely become a lead in its own class! There is no multiplayer option which isn't a disappointment because I already knew about it and now so do you. Don't miss this game and enjoy!"
1,NO MORE INTRUSIVE AND CRAPPY DRMS PLEASE,"I am VERY interested in this game and was about to get it until I read the reviews. I'm not going to buy this and any other that comes with crappy and problematic kinds of drm, the funny part with this is that it just makes people run away and get pirated and cracked copies instead.That's all I wanted to say."
1,PC version unplayable! (console version was fun though),"I bought this not from Amazon but from Steam. I've tried on three different OS installs, not a single one will get past the SecureROM DRM nonsense! The tech support is nonresponsive, I can't return it, I'm basically out $50 (I bought it when it came out).I eventually bought it AGAIN for Xbox360. Although I hate playing shooters on consoles, the game itself is quite fun and well done. Not sure how to rate it though -- 0% for unplayable PC version, 97% for a playable version."
2,"Yes, I own it","This game is sexy. No one can argue that fact.Sadly, it has a lot of performance issues. Yes, yes, my dear fanboys I realize my computer is causing the performance issues. Choose to believe or don't but I have a top of the line computer. Save your money on the PC version and buy an Xbox 360 and Bioshock, it will be more expensive but a hell of a lot more enjoyable."
5,Awesome,"Best game i've bought in ages.Very good gameplay, graphics are stunning (specially on my 30"" dell) and the controls are easy."
5,Ignore the other reviews.,"Now, I have read the Customer reviews saying that they will not install this game on their PCs because of the DRM root kits. This is BullSh**. The rootkits are there, but if that is the reason you are not going to allow yourself one of the greatest gaming experiences of all time then you are the grandest of morons. By the way if you are thinking of buying this for Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, they too have their own DRM stuff so either way you can't escape it. Bioshock is perhaps one of the greatest games ever made, 2K did a fantastic job. The story is great, the graphics are phenomenal, and the game plays very well. Rapture is portrayed perfectly as a decrepit, decaying city under the sea. I have played this game through three times and my experience changes each time. If you are looking for a game that will continue to entertain you for a long time, look no further. Now if you will excuse me I hear a Little Sister around the corner and I need some more ADAM."
2,Bioshock smells like it had more than one in the stink,"Bioshock is a great game....for about 40 minutes. After that its story gets convoluted and tries to be smarter than it is. And like most things that fall into that hole, it throws in a M Night Shamalayn patented ""twist"" into the mix, which fails miserably.This game had promise, it has an interesting mechanic and decent graphics, but the story leaves a lot to be desired and the combat is repetitive and boring.Its a shame as what I read the original story was going to be, involving cult deprogramers and the like, was scrapped for this horrible stuff.Download the demo, it will leave a better taste in your mouth and you won't get to the crap nougat center of this game. And you can avoid all that license protection stuff too. Fun times."
4,Game of the Year?,"This isn't the funnest game I've ever played but it is still pretty entertaining.I can say, they could've done more with the game like more than 2 different endings, make the levels a bit more vertical as you see the surrounding buildings and structures are."
4,excelentes graficos,uno de los mejores juegos del año en cuanto a graficos. aunque me hizo recordar los antiguos juegos que podias cargar inumerables armas. (quizas sea la parte negativa) pero en lineas geenrales muy bueno.
1,waste of money,dont like this game at all wont play it agian either. wish I had my money back game was no fun at all.
4,what a cool game!,"lots of fun, i would rate it second after crysis.. but still fun!!! and a very creepy setting! (i love that part)"
2,"Hype = Fun? ....lies and deception, I tell you!","I literally just finished Bioshock less than 10 minutes ago and I am almost ashamed to admit I played it. The graphics while mind numbingly gorgeous and the effects incredible, a game needs more than simply being pretty to be entertaining. The voice acting is also very well done with lines and voice-overs that aren't the typical ""CUTSCENE! TURN OFF THE SPEAKERS QUICK!"" type. However, the combat system is terrible, the creatures take tons and tons of ammo to kill, but ammo is very hard to come across. So for the majority of the game you carry a wrench around trying to hit things that are running and shooting at you. The ""adaptive learning"" system that was so boasted about showed nothing different in my play experience. The creatures still ducked/bobbed/weaved the same as the beginning. After the 10 hours I just spent, I demand a refund or raincheck for those 10 hours wasted. Bioshock gets nothing more than a 3 out of 10."
2,Atospheric is all it is,"I cannot begin to fathom why this game is so highly praised. It's a clunky, slow-moving, boring, albeit extremely atmospheric shooter. The developers had all of Rapture to play with and have interesting relationships with various characters, yet they sidestepped any possibility at making this game what it could have been. The only communication with friendly people in Rapture is via radio.The city has a plethora of tape recordings lying around to discover, containing insight on the history of Rapture. However, there is no point in listening to them.The game is too easy. There's no shortage of ammo and upon death you simply respawn in the area as you left it. You can fight a Big Daddy with your wrench if you so desire and die many times in the process at no penalty.Overall, the game had a huge amount of potential, but neglected it and Bioshock became just another shooter."
3,***Not as Fun as 2***,I made the mistake of playing 2 first and then liked it so much made the plunge into the aquarium again in hopes that this one would fulfill my what ever it was I wanted fulfilled but it droops in comparison or however you spell stacking up so in my humble opinion I give it a solid three stars. Do yourself a favor and just play 2 and don't look back.
3,Many old tricks,"The first machine I tried this on, everything was very jerky and the controls sluggish. Went on-line and found how to alter the video performance, and it helped some. Then my computer crashed and I went to a new Windows 7 machine and the graphics and flow work flawlessly. Much of the game feels 2D though. Some of the puzzles are really ""old school"". It is frustrating to not be able to figure how one weapon will work versus another, as nothing seems to be consistent on how they work on killing the different bad guys. Fairly linear in progression, but sometimes I have had to go to a Walk Through to try and figure out what was required ""next"" (three times I think). Middle of the road type game, not good enough for me to consider the Bioshock2 though."
1,This is no System Shock...,"I recently bought BioShock through Steam because it was discounted. Basically, you can't own this game. You either buy the physical copy and have limited installs, or you buy it through Steam and be forced to log in every time you want to play.So after I asked Valve for permission to play the game I just payed for, the real disappointment set in. I've read dozens of articles that describe this game as being like System Shock. It has exactly three things in common with System Shock: The word ""shock"" is in the title, there's hacking (or is it plumbing?) and there are multiple types of ammunition for each weapon. The game goes for a retro atmosphere, but it only succeeds at this by looking like it was made in the late 90's with an outdated engine. I gave it two stars for ""fun"" because it inspired me to play better games.""BS"" is a fitting abbreviation for this game. It was a HUGE disappointment."
4,Positive and negative aspects of Bioshock (PC),"+ Good story quality.+ Very good graphics (beautiful water effects if you're using newest gen GPU).+ Deep atmosphere.- Forces you to install copy protection SecuROM and to activate the game online - creates unpleasant installation limitations.- Problematic game stability: The game crashes on rare occasions, the framerate reaches 1-.7fps at certain points but is totally smooth otherwise, and some users have reported total loss of audio.- It would have been advantageous to cut the game length by 30% by removing the most annoying and boring parts (to preserve high overall game quality).- It would have been advantageous to remove the manual saving feature from the game (to avoid excessive reloads and increase the much criticized low difficulty of the game, thus improving general gaming experience)."
3,Confusing Saves,"A real good looking game with some different elements that are enjoyable. However, some real drawbacks, the biggest of which is the confusing game saving design. What kind of schmuck did this to an expensive game? You run in a circle every time you close it out, only to find yourself locked in a previous chapter when reopening . . . .pretty lame for fifty bucks. Don't be fooled, unless you've got plenty O cash & time."
3,"some hype, some good...","Suffers a bit from overhype. a 360 port they should have worked on a bit longer to stabilize. The look is wonderful, it's soul is missing.. No real new gameplay is offered as you roam around using your magic powers in what may as well be Doom3 levels with a different paintjob.. Lack of enemy varieties and weapon balance is bad, You can wrench your way through the whole game if you want and get resurrected without penalty over and over again.. Any traces of the RPG qualities it's successor SShock 2 had are erased so a friendlier, linear story can unfold to a bigger audience which is all that mattered. The masses ate this up so expect more steampunk games with spiffy soundtracks and magic powers in the future.. Nearly good, just ok.."
1,Won't Play,Avoid this game. Not worth the trouble.I bought it and it installed alright. Played a bit and closed the game. Now the game is installed but my DVD drive won't read the disk. Went through weeks of tech support (2k and Securom) to no avail. Very mad about this one.
5,FPS fun,"A typical FPS except for the plasmids, gene tonics and story which do a lot to add to the game play. My biggest complaint was that the cannon fodder type enemies were too difficult on hard (and the Big Daddies too easy on Easy) so that the weapons felt underpowered later in the game even after upgrading them, so I was left using the wrench for most of my kills. Sure it's fun to crack a few skulls with a big chunk of steel, but sometimes I want to blow someone's head off with a shotgun in ONE go. Still a lot of fun though."
5,GREAT game,"The game was great. Look forward to playing sequels. Product came on time, in good condition and at a good price. Fantastic. I hope these developers stay away from releasing them on Steam!"
5,Great game!,"I got BioShock from the Steam service last year shortly after release and played it through 3 times. Twice on a 5 yr old WinXp machine and once on a new Vista quad core machine. Zero problems with either. Its not a perfect game, but for me to replay a game, it had to be fun and a bit different each time. (Well, the story is the same each time, but you have many(!) ways to do the combat>) Its a bit on the easy side even with the patch which allows you to disable the super easy continue feature. I've heard people in general have had less problems with the Steam version, but that's just anecdotal. If you have any doubts, just buy it from somewhere that will let you return it if it doesn't work."
1,Bioshock Disappointment,"Have struggled with Bioshock for several weeks now. I am finally throwing in the towel. Amazing art work and scene sets cannot compensate for the frenetic, shadowy and fleeting fps combat situations, all taking place in a dark, poorly lit (albeit artistic) underwater civilization. Give me the light and air of Half Life 2, or Crysis, or FEAR. My sense is that this a game for gamers--especially younger gamers, who might have the endurance and inquisitiveness/inventiveness to traipse through an endless array of beautiful, but ulimately obscure rooms/locales. Bioshock is beautifully crafted, but dreary, uninteresting, and not nearly as engaging as an fps as reviews had led me to believe."
2,Poor Programming,"Basically, this game does not work on most video cards (at least for the PC version). If you have an ATI card over a year old...don't waste your money on this game...it won't play on your system.2K Games should have advertised IN BIG LETTERS that this game requires an SM 3.0 card instead of just putting it in the last minute README file.If 2K were smart, they'd pull the game...Anyway, wait a few months...this one will be in the $5 bin soon enough"
1,Game will exceed the capacity of your machine to run it successfully,"This game was built for only those customers that have the newest (less than one year old) and most expensive graphics cards. Do not buy it unless your PC's capabilities can exceed the recommended requirements. Minimum requirements don't matter, it will be so slow and lacking in detail that you will be unsatisfied. There are also hidden graphics requirements (like the shader problem) that could make it impossible even to play the game at all. As someone that has bought over 250 games over the past 20 years, I was sorry to see that 2K software didn't understand understand the basics about shipping software that meets customer needs."
3,Would of rate it higher but hate the online connection required to activate the game,Bioshock's game play is excellent though the game is not that hard overall. What annoyed me was that you need an online connection to activate the game. This is one of the most annoying problems with modern games. Not everyone has access to an internet connection. Namely those of use currently in Iraq. Due to this I will not be buying anymore games from this company just as I won't purchase anymore of the Half Life series.
1,Research before you purchase!,"I already had Bioshock in my shopping cart, when I learned about its 'copy protection scheme' and how it requires its installation to be verified through the Internet. This process prevents the game from being installed more than 5 times, which is something unnacceptable in my opinion. Buy at your own risk."
1,"Kids, just say no to DRM and Sony rootkits","Wow, Sony just can't seem to get enough of the rootkits. CD, USB, and BioShock (SecuROM). For anyone who installed the game or demo (yes, even the demo has the exact same draconian drm/rootkit combo) get a rootkit revealer and clean up your system. Even with all this DRM, I bet a hack will still come out. If so, the pirated version of BioShock will be the best one. Go figure?"
3,Bioshock de-activates me,"Starting out the game was pretty cool, but the constent activation request were getting toe real fast. For instance, you have to activate it the first time....no problem there, but then I cameback to play the game the next day and it wanted me to re-activate it. It was pretty much the same routine, it had to be re-activaded everyday. So I jabs uninstalled it and haven't got around to re-installing it.The graphics were pretty impressive, kind of made you feel like you were in a differant time era.Sounds were spot on and sounded good and crispOverall I liked the game, but the constant activation really ruined the experiance for me."
1,"Buggy Game, Horrendous customer service","BEWARE! Although there are several good reviews about this product, I played this and got stuck in a buggy loop. I contacted the customer service and they assigned a case and completely ignored me. After 10's of e-mails, they just went silent. I even told them that I'll send them my save of the game so that they can play it /fix and it , but no hope.There are several bugs with the games 2K manufacturers and if you're unfortunate enough to get stuck in one of them mid way through hours and hours of play you're doomed. They don't even have new and proper patches for these bugs. How can they, if they don't listen to customer issues.It's too unfortunate that they're getting all these good reviews. The game is reasonably fun to play. But not as much as fun, when you get stuck after playings for 10's and 10's of hours and have to forfeit.I'm never buying games from 2K games again."
1,Sent it back for a refund,"Received this game and tried to install it, everything seemed OK during the install, but right after the install was completed, the game connected immediately to the game's web site for some type of a patch file download. It downloaded the patch file from it's own web site, then told me that the patch file was not digitally signed and the complete installation was aborted and deleted immediately by the install function.No matter how many times I tried to reinstall this game, the exact same thing happened. I finally said screw it and I sent it back for a full refund."
1,miserable experience trying to get the game to run!,"This is not a review of the gameplay, because I can't play the game!The ""online activator"" application does not accept the serial number printed on the back of the manual. I sent email to their support department yesterday and still do not have a response. I called their USA tech support number (800)638-0127 and receive a strange phone company message ""this number can not be reached from where you are calling"".This is ridiculous. I don't expect to pay almost $50 for a game and have it not work."
4,Don't Buy this Great Game!,"Great Game! But I highly advise you not to buy this version. The security crap (read the other reviews) has utterly disabled me from installing it properly. My only disc drive cannot read the disc... And now if I want to pay, my only option is to buy it again?! Of course there are other methods...If you want to play this game (especially to prep yourself for the coming sequel!), I suggest you do one of the following:1. Get it from Steam [...]2. Get it from ""somewhere else"" (assuming you know how and what I mean)Just don't buy this version!"
1,"Do not buy,","Do not buy! Did not come with activation codes or manual, cannot play. Bought for Fathers day with 2-day shipping, waste of money."
4,One of the Best Games this Year,"After anticipating this title for a few months prior to release, I had high expectations. Just about all of them were met. If you've got the hardware, this game is visually stunning and the atmosphere is great. The combat system is fun and the integration of puzzle solving keeps the gameplay fresh. Definately a must have this year."
5,An Amazing Take on Story & Gameplay,"This game is a really awesome game. The story starts off with a bang and does not stop during the rest of the game. It continues to keep you on your toes. Graphics are nice. You get more powerful through upgrading plasmids which are the highlight of the game. It really is true that you and your friend will play the game completely different. So many choices make a replay just as good as the first time around. I have had no problems with running it, just make sure you meet the recommended requirements and you should be fine. Have a friend who plays it on a PIV 3Ghz, 7900, and it runs fine. Excellent game, you have to experience the game of the year."
1,BEWARE SecuROM!,"Don't get me wrong, BioShock is an amazing game, I absolutely love it, but it installs SecuROM on your computer which is NOT a good thing and it limits the amount of times you can install the game until it's a paperweight. I was very disappointed to disover that BioShock installed SecuROM on my PC, if you have an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 buy it for one of those... but not PC.BioShock is a deep and rich game that will keep you immersed in its strange underwater fantasy world for hours at a time. You never know what is going to happen next and strange noises lurk around every corner of the city of Rapture. If you are looking for a thrilling first person shooter to occupy a bit of your time this would be the game to buy. 9/10."
5,Great Game,"I was disappointed in the delivery, was told it would be delivered by December 24th and I did not get it until December 27th. I had ordered other items from different sources through Amazon at the same time and received them well before the 24th."
5,Entertaining and Challenging,"This is by far one of my favorite games. The graphics are outstanding and the game play is thought provoking. The environment allows a player to use objects creatively to eliminate threats. The plasmids are very fun to use and provides hours of laughter. Having recently rebuilt my computer, I have found that a 2gig, 1.86 Intel Duo, NVIDIA 7600gt, allows for full settings at a decent screen size. I have had no issues with frame freezes or experienced lags in frame rate.The AI is pretty good and provides more of an overall challenge. The characters seem to be part of the world and do not simple appear from no where like other games. (Doom) The game does not feel forced as far as open ended vs. linear. There are plenty of areas to explorer that are not necessarily required to complete the game.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. (Mature audiences)"
2,DO NOT buy it for the PC!!!,"It is hard to install and does not work on all computers (including mine) it is a GREAT game but buy it for XBOX 360, and if you dont have one save up for it!"
1,"Great Game, But It Is Not Worth The DRM Scheme","This game uses the same horrible DRM scheme that is found on Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Crysis Warhead, Spore, Dead Space, Sacred 2, and Red Alert 3. I refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game. There are several games that I own that I have had to install more than five times for various reasons. That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme). The only thing this DRM does do is prevent this game from entering the used game market."
1,won't run on HP DV9535 and demo will cause Intel(R) Core (TM) 2 Duo machines to crash,"The game won't run on HP DV9535 laptops with Intel(R) Core (TM) 2 Duo processors with Nivida graphics cards 8600 GS, 2GB RAM and 1.5 Ghz processor. The DEMO version installs a driver AMDLLD.sys. As soon as you reboot, the system crashes with a blue screen. Which is no supprise as this is a INTEL machine. You need to delete the file in safe mode before rebooting the system. I wonder how a company can sell such a poorly developed product? I can't even return this lousy product as the ""copy right"" seal is broken."
4,Bioshock PC,"This is a fun game overall but can get a little repetitive. It seems to go cheap on the cash you can pick up and to not have a very good variety of enemies. Plenty of action though. Graphics are ok but the audio in this game is awesome. If you haven't played this yet and your computer can run it fine, then I would say give it a try. It's no Crysis but worth the money."
4,Great Ergonomics on this Keypad,"I have looked at the others, even bought a different one when I mistakenly thought it wouldn't work on an xp machine. I much prefer this style of keypad to the flat wafer looking ones on the market. For anyone used to a regular adding machine style calculator layout, this is the best one I've seen.I think I have an older model but it looks exactly like this one. It says its a KU-9880.Now, a usb hub would be a cool addition to it, but... I'll sacrifice it for the ergonomics."
1,Had to give it one star because of this.,"I have been using this at work for the last week or so. They supplied it so I did not buy it, but if I did buy it I would have returned based on one thing. It DOESN""T have the backspace key in the upper right hand corner. I was using it for the first time and I was thinking something is different with this but I can't put my finger on it. Then a made a mistake and went to hit the backspace key on the number pad and said wait a second there isn't one.So if you are using a laptop and you make a mistake punching in numbers you have to go over to the laptop keyboard and hit the backspace. Is this not totally ridiculous? I do appreciate them giving us a bigger addition symbol, but to take away the backspace button in favor of it is crazy.Yes i do like it, but I cannot use it because of the backspace issue. I mean unless you are a perfect number puncher and never miss a number you need the backspace key."
5,Works on OS X Snow Leopard MacBook Pro,"I bought this because from other reviews it seemed it might work on OS X. I have a MacBook Pro, and I didn't want a wireless number pad because I don't want to bother with batteries for this kind of peripheral. When you plug it in, OS X tells you that it doesn't know what kind of keyboard it is. You can't complete the wizard it gives you, but if you just close the window, it just works. The numlock button doesn't seem to do anything in OS X, but it's not the most important thing, since you already have arrow keys. In WMWare Fusion, the numlock is recognized by Windows."
4,Fine for the price,"I bought this for use with an HP Pavilion laptop, and have had no trouble with it. I wish it had a delete or backspace button on it, but otherwise no complaints."
2,Hold on to your wallet and find a cheaper source...,"If you have played the game for more than ten hours and still have questions, find an unofficial internet source. MUCH of the book is filler. It does explain stats a little better and gives merc interactions... thats about it. It didn't say how and which items to merge and what they do. I've had more success with online FAQ's."
2,BEETLE CAR PURIFIER,"WHEN I GOT IT IT MADE MY TRUCK SMELL LIKE A NEW VEHICLE THE 1ST 2 DAYS. BUT IT'S BEEN 3 DAYS AND THIS MORNING I NOTICED THAT IT SMELLED LIKE SMOKE. I HAVEN'T USED THE AIR FRESHENER BEADS YET, SO MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE."
2,Didn't resist my thumb!!!,"I didn't know that a manual pencil sharpener could be that cheap!! My thumb litteraly went through the casing while trying to close it! And when it's closed,it feels very lose!! The shipping was pretty fast tho and the product looks very clean before going further more!"
5,Now This is a pencil sharpener!,"I was having a bad week. Everything I did turned to mush. I went to sharpen a pencil and my manual crank plastic pencil sharpener broke off the wall in my hand. It was a piece of junk to start with but still it was distressing. This time I found a far better selection of manual pencil sharpeners. I decided to get the metal pencil sharpener that I remembered from my parochial school days. I picked this one because it was all metal but not too expensive. When it came in the mail, I was instantly pleased. It is shiny and sturdy and does a nice job of sharpening pencils without requiring a battery or power cord. What more do I need? It is a nice trip down memory lane for me. Lots of mischief happened at the pencil sharpener in my school. And it works like a dream!"
3,You get what you pay for!,It sharpens very well. The biggest problem is getting the cover back on after emptying it. It is extremely difficult and I have had many problems with it falling off in the middle of sharpening and it isn't so great to clean up lead and shavings all over the floor a couple of times a week. I have yet to find one that works as great as the one I had growing up!
2,"Close, but no cigar.....","This is an okay pencil sharpener, but it sharpens only one side of the pencil. It takes effort to sharpen a pencil with this thing so don't think children will be using it with any success. You will be the primary pencil sharpener here, and it is no easy task with this MISS of a thing. We have had it one year, it still 'works', but good luck finding a pencil sharpener that actually does. Let me know if you do find one that works properly and last longer than three months, I would be interested."
4,Works like a pencil sharpener,The screws that came with it were pretty small so we used our own. The case itself is kinda difficult to get back on each time after emptying the shaving. Other than that it works great. Reminds me of school when I was a child.
2,average,Pencil sharpener is not that well built. Sharpens pencils unevenly and is hard to remove and re-attach bin. For the price it's worth it.
2,Does not sharpen large pencils,The sharpener sharpens pencils to a very long taper to where when you write the point breaks off. You almost have to hold the pencil perpendicular to the paper to prevent breakage. It would not even sharpen large diameter pencils. I tried inserting the pencil while I had the cover removed and I could see that the blades do not even touch the pencil no matter how hard I pushed it into the sharpener. Another piece of trash made in China.
3,I didn't expect...,that there is only 1 cutting blade. I do have to say that is does sharpen really well. I got this for Christmas and THAT is when I found out that there was only 1 cutting blade.
2,Pencil Sharpener Struggle,"This may not be a fair review. I'm looking for a sharpener for my pastel pencils. What I found with this sharpener is the tips of the pastel pencils break easily (as in most sharpeners) and I have to take the case off to dislodge the point in the mechanism. What I found with this model is it's difficult to put the case back on once removed. I tried many angles and rotations to get it to snap back in. When I think I've figured out how to get it to snap back in, it doesn't work the next time. I struggle with this regularly."
3,Not the quality I'd experienced with the older and heavier ones,"Just OK. If you really want one like this, spend a little more and get a better quality pencil sharpener."
5,Sharp,"I like this pencil sharpener very much.. It doesn't sharpen endlessly as most do, some kind of stop mechanism. And the point is truely amazing. I hope it's durable to last a long time."
2,Not impressed.,"Very flimsy pencil hole guide, only ONE cutter inside instead of two, and both the handle and hole guide wobble. It works okay on regular sized pencils, but fat pencils for kids will not go deep enough to sharpen. Also, when pencils are sharpened, the taper of the cut is really long. Much longer than the taper of a traditional sharpened pencil you would get from an 'old school' style sharpener. Overall, I would not buy this again and will look for another sharpener. This isn't the one."
5,Just like elementary school,"Every household should have one of these. If you ever use pencils for drawing, get one! The ease of use and reliability make such a difference. I sharpened a couple dozen pencils as soon as I got it, and every one came out with a perfect tip; not once did I get a break. The crank is very satisfying to use, and feels very sturdy. You can feel a release of tension when the sharpening is done, which helps prevent over-sharpening and shortening your pencil.The sharper, longer pencil tip that you get will last longer than handheld sharpeners, and provides finer drawing lines.I've read that the case is hard to open to empty shavings, so I haven't even tried- it's VERY easy to simply remove the entire case and empty shavings through the grinder hole. I just hold it over the trash and poke a pencil in and spin it around a bit. Easy.Great product!"
3,Okay but not like the old ones,"I bought this sharpener because I remember the ones we had in school. It only has one cutting blade but seems to work fine. Not as sturdy as I remember, but what is these days."
5,So far So good,"Over the past few years I have bought various pencil sharpener's from Wal-Mart and the like. They all ended up in the trash. This one seems to be trustworthy just like the one's I remember from school. I have had it for around a month now and my quite destructive 7 year old son enjoy's using it, and has yet to destroy it--so I am happy."
1,"Too much trouble to return it, so into the trash it goes","The good: makes a nice, sharp point on the pencil without breaking the lead (unlike a lot of cheap sharpeners).The bad: does not center the pencil, so that lovely lead is surrounded by a shroud of wood that renders it useless.The verdict: utterly useless, unless you think sharpened pencils make good decorations.In addition, the metal housing is so flimsy that it might as well have been made of paper -- it crushes when you try to open it to empty the shavings. This is NOT your old school pencil sharpener.Too much trouble to return it to Amazon, so I threw it away.Anyone know where to get a real pencil sharpener?"
3,Only one cutting blade,"The description refers to ""Solid steel cutters and gears,"" but there is only one cutting blade. I decided to return it and buy something with dual cutting blades."
5,My FAVORITE Mother's Day gift,"I've been blest with THE most thoughtful daughter-in-law imaginable. I work from home and constantly have my phone headset on. She obviously had noted that my (now) old headset's ""boom"" had become loose, hung down and had bad voice transmission. What a surprise when I opened the box from Photoland NY and saw this headset! Tried it out immediately ... the result is crystal clear transmission and reception in total comfort! I love this headset (and my daughter-in-law!)Mary Ann WrightFlorida"
3,Not very durable,"Although this headset does its job well and it is light and comfortable, it is not very durable. After about 1 year, the volume adjustment started to fail. Later, the plastic clip broke off on its weakest part (the part where it attaches to the wire). Then the head size adjustment broke and it moves freely instead of staying fixed where you left it. I've had it for 2 1/2 years and had used it every day but recently the volume adjustment failed completely and I can't hear anything. I think this kind of thing should last longer than 2 - 2 1/2 years."
5,Great book for new author Chris Dolley-highly recommended for sci-fi fans!,"Wow! This was an amazing book! I raelly liked it: I could not put it down. The idea of parrallel dimension/alternate reality was different that one usualy finds in sci-fi books, and it made this book memorable. I don't want to give away the story with spoilers. The characters were great, especially the main two: Graham and Annalisse. They really came alive for me. This book should become a classic science fiction book. It is hard to believe that this is Chris Dolley's first major novel! Keep up the great work!From the other reviews, I am the first one to read the ""mass-market"" paperback, not an advanced copy. I am not sure if there was anything different. You should go out and buy this wonderful book! Also check out Chris Dolley's second book Shift"
2,Resonance,I kept thinking this will come together shortly....it bounced around so much...which I realize is part of the concept of the story...but just stayed too confusing for me. I finally gave up after completing 61% and felt I had wasted my time...I really can't recommend this book.
