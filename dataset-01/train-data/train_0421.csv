5,This book is great!,The art in this one was great. Naoko really did it right! The book covers the end of the first series of Sailor Moon and the beginning of R. YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!
4,"""I can't get enough, of those Funky Horns!""","This is my all-time funk group and Kool & the Gang at their best! I love the JT era, but this CD is who Kool & the Gang really are! I can't get enough of those horns! My favorite song on here is ""Hollywood Swinging, but the best song on here is ""Who's Gonna Take the Weight"" Aw man, the Gang was in a zone on that song! Couldn't nobody touch them on the horns! Get this CD now, because it is a real Kool CD!"
3,Kool jazz by kool & the gang,"Great improvization and horn section work. Kool is an underrated bassist, the vocals arent the best but in who's gonna take the weight, summer madness(live) and kg is some of the best music of the era."
4,The one to have.,"If you like pre-J.T. Kool and the Gang, this has most of what you need. Heavy on the funk, not as slick, just the way I like it. They should've put the studio version of ""Summer Madness"" on instead of the live version, though."
5,"Funky, cool, jazzy...","Essential for the casual Kool and the Gang fan. This CD contains many of their relatively early hits. It makes an excellent complement to their later work as contained in the ""Millenium Collection"" series."
4,Sentence-level advice and an overview of legal analysis.,"The author of this book is a respected writer and a teacher of legal writing. He knows his way around grammar, and it shows in this book. It contains a lot of detailed advice for constructing readable and sensible legal sentences. In a few places it was, in fact, perhaps a little too dense and detailed for the typical lawyer. Still, lawyers need to know how to create clear and correct sentences, and this book shows how.The next part of the book discusses ""the content of legal writing."" It addresses the basics of legal analysis in the context of a traditional legal memo. Though the treatment is fairly general and short, it does present a lot of basic and reliable advice for writing a legal analysis."
4,Mind's Shadows illuminated,"Another stunning book by Sir Roger Penrose. It's really a five star book discounted here by one star because those lacking physics and mathematics will find some passages hard work, even though the author is being as kind as possible in a book of this calibre.The book is a neat sequel to his ""The Emperor's New Mind"", extending the central theme that our little-understood human consciousness allows us to think way beyond the computational and mindless world of artificial intelligence.In doing so, we have a marvellous survey of classical and modern physics, including the mysteries of the quantum world.Sir Roger raises the question 'Will we ever be able to truly understand our own Nature-provided brain and its processes in terms of our own science?', and argues that, somewhere out there beyond our present reach, there is a unifying Platonic view of the Universe.This book is a tour de force on several planes. Highly recommended."
5,Very Good,I got this book in a very good condition. My book arrived just in time. Price was low.I am very much satisfied buying this book from amazon.com.
2,Too complex!,"I'm sorry, but this book went way over my head. Was this the plan, or am I just not up to all this?"
2,The wild-eyed boy from freecloud,"Whatsoe'er word that Penrose has written, THAT word shall I read. For it is my solemn duty to imbibe the ideas of another person, and come to grips with them. This I style philosophy. Thank goodness I have Rog' to ""argue"" for a ""philosophical position."" And of course there will be lots of people arguing against him. They will all be jostling around like stock-brokers on the floor of the exchange, waving little slips of paper, sweating, grimacing, their faces a gray screen with hustler faces moving across it. But lets see, let me furrow my brow and adopt a serious expression when the words ""Physicalism"" and ""Mentalism"" are bandied. Let me puff on my pipe and say ""Hmmmm"" at irregular intervals. Let me hear mention of John Searle with a straight face. For this is the stuff of life."
3,"Quality product, but didn't fit","High quality drawer glides, but the ""undermount"" style wouldn't retro-git to my current cabinetry. I'll be returning them for credit."
5,Why do the best books go out of print!?,"I bought this 4 years ago for my 1st son, it is the ONLY comprehensive medical journal of its kind, easy to organize, keep track of important milestones, prompt you on doctor visits, etc. I took it apart and put it into a 3 ring binder w/ divider tabs w/ pockets, to keep all prescriptions, vaccine inserts, etc. to have documentation of everything the Dr. gave us at each visit. The book is no longer in print, which is a tragedy. It's so important to remember critical health information for future reference: I hope they reprint this invaluable book."
4,Nuts is not nuts,Nuts is one of babs best performances.Imagine not even an oscar nod dreyfuss and staplton are standouts in supporting roles. A gem
4,Nuts,"This movie deals with a topic very few will dare to even talk about. It is about parental sexual abuse. It is handled with truth and honesty, not hiding the awful, sometimes life-long damage and wounds inflicted on its victims. A very real and compassionate movie."
5,Disturbing but immensely powerful,"Disturbing but immensely powerful. . .Top-quality acting from everyone, and a perfect script. The subject is disturbing but kudos to the movie industry for having room for such dramas amidst its brainless entertainment.Not pleasant but unforgettable and must-see watching."
4,Better than Critics rate it !,"This movie is pretty good. The casting is possibly the best of any of Streisand's movies, Outside of Prince of Tides, and the performances put together by Streisand and Dreyfus are easily the best of their careers. The court room scenes are sterotypical of any courtroom drama, but the story outside the room is what keeps the film moving. Recommend it to anyone looking for a good Streisand or Dreyfus film."
5,Nuts,"Barbara was very good in this movie, she did a excellent job. I was on the egde of my set. I like the story very mush. Other would really enjoy this movie. Dreyfuss was very good as the defender. The courtroom was the best."
1,Barbra as a hooker?,"Rent it for the hilarious moment when Babs walks into a restaurant and the camera follows her--in profile--as all the men in the place leer at her. Ah, the movies!"
5,"Barbara, Barbara, Barbara","So much talent, Every body makes every body work in this one. This was the right cast through out and Barbara carries the field."
1,Extremely disapointing,"When I saw the pictures for this eyeshadow, I thought it would be great...after purchasing it, I wish I could take it back. The ads make it look really luminous and have a metallic sheen. I bought the silver color and it came off looking like just plain gray. Did not look metallic whatsoever! Thought that maybe I needed to apply more but instead it just became a darker gray and creased instantly. Even blending with my finger did not help, it just looked horrible. I ended up wiping it all off, would NOT recommend this product if you are wanting the look in the ads."
4,the early step,"""The Next Step"" was my first KR album. KR does stand out from the rests as he chooses his notes to speak, rather than just going over some chord changes. In this (mostly) standard songs, he and the band managed to bring the music up the average jam session by their ability and mastery on their respective instruments. It still has the jam session feeling, enough balance of relax-tension to make it a good album."
2,Dissapointed,"I saw K.R. live a few years ago with Ben Street and it sounded great....very fun jazz...like Marc Johnson or Bill Frisell. This album was not at all what I expected.It might just be a matter of personal taste....this was way way too ""straight ahead"" ""wynton marsalis-like"". He's a great musician... ....I just didn't like this album."
3,Attractive drippy teapot,Attractive teapot with an unfortunately drippy spout. I actually quickly replaced this teapot with another because I just wasn't able to pour a cup of tea without dripping on the tablecloth.
5,Easy on the ears music by melow artist,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to ""The Island"" by Thomas Allan. It's a smooth piece of music with just the right accompanyment. Slow jazz at its best. Would be great to cuddle up in front of a warm fireplace with this album playing softly in the background."
4,Will take you by surprise,"A really great fantasy series from the early nineties. This book pushes into something quite grand at times. Sometimes I wish for more consistent character development, but the author's use of language and tight plot-threading is superb. An absorbing, enjoyable read, without resorting to becoming overly-grand."
5,I wish she was still like this,"Don't get me wrong, I loved her next three albums and anticipate her next one also, but she had something here that was just so raw, so unhinged that it almost feels like she was someone that I dated, loved and was screwed over by. This record is beguiling, inviting you in and then ripping your head off (or ""twisting"" it off, as she says in the title track). She confronts feminine iconography from the 50foot woman to Tarzan's Jane to Adam's Eve, blazing a path through a man's world. Yuri G, for those not nerdy enough, is Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. I also recommend Blonde Redhead's ""Fake Can be Just As Good"", another blistering record from some guys who have softened up lately."
3,Rid Of Me!,"Don't get me wrong. I Like this album And I think it's good.the only thing that bothers me is that you can't hear everythingPolly Jean says on the album and sometimes it gets a littlefustrading trying to hear what she says because there are no lyrics with the album and two songs on this album about Man-size annoy me sometimes but overall this is a good effort. The production is somewhat well you can hardly call it that but it gives good space for the melodies and the music which has to be the main keye of the albums aclaim. This contains raw emoitions, great guitar riffs and very interesting version of Bob Dylan's track Higway 61 revisited. Overall a good effort that any real music fan should have in their collection."
3,Making a splash,"A recording whose reputation begs influence and historical significance (and not without a handful of flat-out brilliant songs), but a release which nonetheless comes across too ragged and underdeveloped to warrant the kind of perfect reviews ""important"" records get. Harvey works the bare-bones, Albini-helmed attacks well, but would vastly mature as a songwriter throughout her career."
3,Dark,"Guess PJ was going through it when she wrote these songs. Really dark and moody. CD would go well if you had a really bad day and a large bottle of something. Some good songs, but think you have to be in the mood. I am a huge PJ Harvey fan, so don't get me wrong!"
2,Maybe not.......,"Ok. I will admit that the first time that I came into contact with Harvey's music was with Is This Desire. I was blown away and thought that it was brilliant. Obviously I had to try her older work, so I got Rid Of Me. What a disappointment! I know that other reviewers have commented that they enjoy the sound on this CD, but I think it is terrible. It is overwhelmimgly repetitive, not even vaguely aesthetically noisy and impossible for me to listen to.......and believe me...I have tried a few times to get into it....with absolutely no success. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it is PJ and maybe this paved the way for a work of pure genius...ie...Is This Desire. Well, time now for me to rid myself of this"
2,Overrated,"This is easily the most overrated of P.J. Harvey's records and is perhaps one of the most overrated alternative records released in the 1990s. The production and song-writing is as shoddy as it gets. With the exception of the misplaced experiment with violins, ""Man-Sized Sextet"" (which was better executed on later records), and the melodic, ""Missed"" (reminescent of her debut release, 'Dry'), the simple punk/riff which works on some of the tracks (""Rid of Me"", ""Yuri-G"", and Bob Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"") becomes tiresome after a short time.NOTE: Whether you agree with my assessment of this record or not, people who really seem to like this record also seem to like her new record (""Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea"") but not 1995's ""To Bring You My Love"" or 1998's ""Is This Desire"", both of which represent far-better productions by Flood. Depending on where you are on the P.J. Harvey fan spectrum, beware."
5,The single greatest rock album of the '90s,"This is one of the very few albums which demands its place on your shelf. PJ's pest work to date is a full-fleged demolition of the throbbing pain of love, obsession, etc., as well as a broad, epic satire of societal gender roles (50 ft. Queenie and Man-Size are the quintessential post-feminist anthems, and real howlers). This aside, the musical virtuosity of the 3-piece is astonishing---no other band in history has ever made better use of the rich history of rock 'n roll, and with such depth and originality. The raw power of the album---which is solid in Steve Albini's flawless production---is grand opera, from the whispery, chilling title track to the distortion-heavy, sobering grand finale, ""Ecstasy."" Put any alleged gender politics aside; this is the purest, most passionate rock album of the decade, a haunting but VERY darkly comic work of inexplicable brilliance from start to finish and beyond."
5,The most amazing album ever made,this is by far my favorite album. each time i listen to it there is something new waiting for me.
4,"Works well, but are a bit bulky","I love the BluMotion products.Mostly.And these glides work VERY well. When used with the Universal rear mount brackets, they can handle some otherwise tricky installations.Downside: They're rather bulky and will steal at least a half inch from the height of your drawer (possibly more, depending on drawer construction).BE ADVISED: If you want to be able to get the drawers out without a screwdriver, they require their own locking devices, and matching the device to the glide is critical. I **strongly** recommend purchasing glides and locking devices as a single unit."
5,Excellent Product,The product was delivered immediately and works great. I will purchase more in the future.
5,Awesome,"Absolutely my favorite seasoning of all time. My entire family orders and uses this stuff. It is great for all kinds of food. I haven't found anything I don't like it on. An absolute must try. Everyone always asks me what I season my food with. I tell them there's just one thing and nothing else, ""Slap Ya Mama""."
1,Wish I'd realized it has garlic powder ...,"I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of just the few reviews. Fresh garlic is great. Garlic powder is insidious. You keep expelling it for days. And that's what this has, alas."
2,"good live show, bad sound quality","this is the 1st meteors CD, i bought, being a tiger army fan. the songs sound good and meaty, but theres too much feedback and the sound quality is messed up. i am embarrased due to my lack of research on this one."
2,This movie is called Ninja Wars,"I don't know why these companies always retitle these movies. So this is a movie with Sanada, Chiba, horrible dubbing, and a full screened presentation of course.I did not enjoy Ninja wars that much. Not enough Ninja's, nto enough action, and the movie is just plain hard to watch."
1,WARNING!,"Be careful. This cable is not your standard USB Mini A to B cable. It is a specialized A mini 4P to B cable and the smaller end is shaped differently and will not work with camera upload/download, nor cell phones or backup devices of the normal USB mini variety. It is a specialized cable and is more rounded."
5,Sistah Robi No Ka Oi,Anyone who is in da know loves this CD. Sistah Robi is the voice of the islands.
2,Not really made for a XV6700,"This is a well-made item, but definitely NOT made for a Verizon XV6700! It's simply too small--you'll have to jam it in--and how will you answer a call quickly? The phone won't slide out easily.Also, the hole at the top for the antenna nub is on the wrong side, meaning your XV6700 external screen will be facing you--and making phantom calls. Mine called my boss on a re-dial--twice. Very embarrassing.You'll need to look elsewhere for a case for the XV6700. Like one REALLY made for this sweet ""pocket PC"" cell phone."
5,question of book,"is there any mention in this book regarding the region of cosenza in calabria, my mother's hometown? i would be most pleased if i could find anything about cosenza in this book or any other you may know of. in the very near future my husband and i will want to visit and it would be nice if i could get any information prior to our going there. thankyou for allowing me to ask this question. linda tremonti"
4,Stress Busters for the Soul,"Fr. Champlin offers a collection of 101 spiritual messages, each accompanied by a suggestion for reflection and a prayer taken from the psalms. The introduction discusses the stress-reducing effect of even short meditation and offers techniques for using the book effectively. Meditation topics include forgiving others, being a Good Samaritan, learning from painful experiences, and developing our gifts. This would be a good resource for leaders of faith sharing or bible study groups. The leader could open to any page for an immediate discussion starter, complete with suggested actions and prayer."
1,Beware!!!,"I purchased this little book, hoping it would be helpful as a stress-reducer for myself and my clients.Instead, I was appalled by the author's extolling the praises of President Bush because he ""prays"". Perhaps. There was another little story of Condi Rice praying with the insiders at Camp David.All of the stories are meant to be heart warming, and are, by and large, anonymous and therefore more universal in appeal.However, with the current state of our nation, I would have much preferred to keep out current politicos.Otherwise, the book is a lightweight. You can do better with many other books out there.One highlight: the author will refund your money if you don't have a reduction of stress or increase of stillness in your life!"
1,Tastes like cough syrup,This tastes like horrible cough syrup. It is nothing like cherry cola. I tried using it several ways and it is just awful.
5,Soft bristles- big broom,I have a large area kitchen floor and this broom saves me so much more time compared to a normal sized broom. Fine bristles aren't hard on the vinyl surface.
4,Great for quick cleaning,I can't stand sweeping but this makes the job alot easier. Because it's so big and bulky I have to sweep the corners and around awkward spots with a regular broomstick broom and then after i've swept all the corners and crevices I just sweep with this pushbroom and it gets all the dust and debris quickly and efficicently. Definitely a must have for someone who has to constantly sweep their house.
3,"Great Value, Great Tracks, Could Do with Some Remastering Though!","As is the case with many compilation cds where material is taken from various dates and hence recorded on various equipment and by various sound engineers, the tracks here suffer from contrasting sound qualities. the first 7 tracks by Debussy were recorded in 1987 and the volume levels are very low; so much so that you can barely here the music.However, for tracks 8-11 by Ravel which was recorded in 1991, the sound quality is very good and you get to appreciate the pieces a lot better. Overall for the price you pay, this is an average disc and is worthy of 3 stars just for the Ravel tracks alone. If you are looking for a well recorded Debussy, look elsewhere."
2,Leg And Wing Rack Stainless Steel,"The Product review paragraph states ""has folding legs for easy storage"". This is not true. Storage space was an issue for us, ergo we gave it a rating of 2. There are other Stainless Steel Leg And Wing Racks available for around the same price that I would have purchased. Other than that, all is good. I am rating the product not the concept."
5,better than this? No way----,"This bbq rack is awesome. It would be very hard to screw it up, put this rack on the grill,full heat, and 50 minutes later----perfect every time. I kid you not.Robert"
5,Very nice,"Excellent helmet! Very sturdy! Covers the whole head! Looks very nice, so my kids like to wear it!Got 2, black and pink! Both are great! Should last a long time! Wish the price was better! I did see them on sale at target for $11.00, otherwise excellent!!!"
4,Great helmet - stylish for the kids,The boys loved these helmets. They look great while protecting the noggins. Good value for the price. Have already withstood some roughhousing.
3,These helmets are HUGE!,When I opened up the box for this helmet I was very surprised by how large it is! I was pretty disappointed by the size because it really looks pretty ridiculous on my kids' heads (though I would never tell them that). I give it three stars because it definitely seems rugged and durable. Just be aware that if you are buying this for a preschooler they might have balance issues because their heads are now the size of a beach ball!
4,A Great Biography of John McLoughlin,"In the introduction, Richard Montgomery states ""...where facts were lacking or where reasonable doubts appeared, I was content to advance opinions frankly stated as such."" I found this very true, and am not sure whether I like or dislike the many occasions where the author ""filled in the blanks."" Also in the introduction, the author wrote ""...my principle aim was to collect, between the covers of a single volume, such information about the 'White-Headed Eagle' as has heretofore been accessible only to the more enterprising students of western history."" True to this aim, Richard Montgomery delivers a wonderful account of one of the greatest heroic figures of the Northwest, Dr. John McLoughlin. This book is definitely worth your while."
5,Lovely Book,"This book is full of lush photographs of Stickley homes. I bought it because it was well-designed, as well as informative. The photo references are impressive, and overall the book pays the same attention to detail that Stickley did. For example, I was impressed that beneath the dust jacket, the cover of the book itself was a beautiful print of a Ginko Flower textile. Almost every page has full color images, and at the back there are individual photo references for furniture, lighting, and decorative items, much like a catalog. The whole thing is indexed as well. Useful as a reference book for research, or an art book to just enjoy."
2,Lacking Quality,"No hooks, no strong instrumentals ... the band is becoming the backdrop for David Thomas' effete and pretentious attempts at dadaistic dinner theatre. A sad finale to the original run of Pere Ubu."
1,Full of misinformation,"Adams is either a liar or too gullible to be allowed in public without his nanny. The most laughable mistake of ""Next World War"" is Adams' story of a printer virus supposedly used in the first Gulf War. He got the story from an April's Fool joke printed in InfoWorld magazine. Duh! For a detailed analysis of the wildly false stories of this book, complete with references, see http://www.soci.niu.edu/~crypt/other/adams.htm"
3,"A bit confused, and bored.","I read this one really expecting to read about futuristic wars of all kinds. No way, the narrative was long, formal and quite boring. I found that it also was a bit disjointed, in nature and not worth the asking price of over $20.00. I would certainly not buy another book written by mr. Adams. I was not pleased with this one at all. As a total effort, it would have to be rated average, at best."
4,"Gripping, but thorough and careful. Chilling.","This well-paced, careful book merits careful attention from policymakers and the general public alike. At times it reads like a novel, but it is very serious stuff indeed."
1,Better to call it the Strategy Crap,"I would expect that the authors of a book that purports to tell companies how to successfully execute their strategy would have a track record of doing the same with their own companies. Apparently that is not a safe assumption. The company that sponsored these authors was acquired last year for a fraction of what the company was worth five years earlier (interestingly enough, that was just about the time two of the authors became senior executives at the company). Save your money and skip over this 200 page piece of marketing material for a failed company."
1,A Bad Bootleg,"This is a bootleg recording of a 1969 show in Toronto. This collection is available under many, many different names including, Science Fiction, Freak Out, Freak Out Song, Painting a Picture, etc., all of which are available from Amazon. The last two songs ""Going to the River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman"" ARE NOT Alice Cooper songs, nor are they performed by Alice Cooper. (You can confirm that with Alice's assistent, Brian ""Renfield"" Nelson.)This is a very poor album. Save your money."
3,Snorting anthrax,"A very old album with low quality sound. Tracks one and six are by a different band who used the same recording area. The song Painting a picture is on Pretties for you under a different name. A version of this is essential for all Alice Cooper collectors.This is a recording made in 1969. It has loads of different names; Snorting anthrax, freak out, science fiction, nobody likes me, nobody likes alice cooper live, ladies man, toronto rock revival '69. All versions have eight tracks apart from Nobody likes Alice Cooper live, which has a medley as a ninth track."
1,Freak Out In Disguise,"I am such an Alice Cooper fan I buy anything with his name on it. What is sad is I already had Freak Out and still bought this album which is the exact same thing. This album is some early Cooper tracks recorded in 1969 but two of the better songs Ain't That Just Like A Woman and Goin To The River are not Alice!!! They are some unknown band who performed with the ACGroup that night in Toronto. This album keeps poping up in different forms but as great as Alice is, unless you are like me and wants everything that says Alice Cooper, avoid this."
2,Puts out too much material,Even with the lowest volume tip it put out too much material for me. Might be ok for decks but wastes too much for outdoor furniture.
4,Very satisfying,"Actually, I didn't read this book but rather listened to it read to me by the very talented Alexander Adams through Time Warner's audio version of the novel. I got caught up in the storytelling on a long trip and found myself urging the narrator to get on to the next chapter so I could find out what happened next in crime-ridden Harlem or war-torn Europe. Being a fan of the movie and fully aware that most sequels bring disappointment, I was hesitant at first to purchase this audio-book, but my curiosity at what the author, Michael Walsh, envisioned as the outcome of events following Casablanca and glimpses into the past of most of the major characters, overrode my concerns. I'm glad I took a chance. This is a very creative and well constructed book, and the author is clearly as big a fan of the movie as anyone. He seeks to enhance our appreciation of the film, I think, and to me he did so very well."
4,Very good storyline!,"Well to try to write a book to what happened after the movie Casablanca ended cannot be easy. However I feel that Walsh made it very good. The book has all the feelings, the characters and the conversation that we saw in the movie. Sometimes it might be to obvious, but overall it is very good. What I found most interesting to read in the book was the flash back to Rick's New York years and the reason to why he had to leave the country. If you are a Casablanca fan, this is a book that you have to read. Who hasn't wondered about what happened after Rick and Capt. Renault walked off into the mist......"
4,as time goes by,"Overall, I found this book a great read. The one major problem ihave is in the movie, it is Victor who says he had to meet with Berger, but in the novel Ilsa tells Rick she was the underground agent that was to meet with Berger. Other than that, this story very well could be filmed as the long awaited sequel to Casablanca."
3,Not a bad sequel...,"For someone who loves the film ""Casablanca"" as much as I do, I was prepared to really pick nits in this book. Believe it or not, it was pretty good, and kept my interest.This takes up right after the end of the film. All of the major players end up taking part in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, which then leads to the massacre and destruction of the town of Lidice. There are flashbacks to Rick's past in New York (which explains why he can't go home again), and some twists and turns in the plot to keep it interesting.A good read, and ""Casablanca"" fans will have some fun spotting the references to the film. Enjoy!"
3,Good read,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good read. The end seemed rushed somehow. I didn't quite understand why some of the things happened the way they happened to bring up the end. I think the author had basically run out of ideas to stay to the ending he anticipated. I guess that's because I could picture an ending wtih more finality and he left himself open for further stories in the future. Also, I had trouble picturing Humphrey Bogart as the character of Rick as this author portrayed him. If one forgets that it is based on CASABLANCA, then one might be tempted to rate it a 4."
4,Open your minds,"I have watched Casablanca for years and have enjoyed the film tremendously. When I first saw this novel on the bookstore shelf, I hesitated. I thought it would be a cheesy sequel to a classic film. But when I finally broke down and bought it, I enjoyed it throughly. I could hear the voices of Bogie and Bergman as though they were still alive and living the parts of Rick and Ilsa. The book was well written and dialog was true to the film dialog! Obviously, you can never replace Rick and Ilsa with other actors and I agree this book should remain a book and not be filmed.... But I thought the story an interesting take on the continuing saga of Rick and Ilsa. I thought the book was worth reading just to hear the immortal charactors of Rick and Ilsa come back to life. It's a fun read..."
2,"Just like any other sequel, only more so.","Like most people who buy this book, I am a huge fan of the movie, ""Casablanca"". I purchased, ""As Time Goes By"" to it to bring back the emotions of the movie. As I began reading the book I almost stopped myself many times thinking I was cheating my cherished Casablanca memories. The story or my love for the original movie kept me reading. Mr. Walsh did a good job of creating an interesting past for Rick, however his future was pretty hooky. Some of the characters headed into unbelievable areas. Victor Laslo turned very dark and jeopardizes Ilsa's life for his obsession. Mr. Walsh cheapens his tale with tongue in cheek references to Humphrey Bogart's career and cause of death. All that said it was not really a bad book. I hope it is not made into a movie so that I will not be tempted to see it."
1,A constant torture!!,"One star is a far too good rating for this terrible piece of writing. This is the worst book I have read for years, if not the WORST EVER. A ridiculous and pathetic performance in any respect, how could an editor let this one possibly pass? As time goes by I hope this very bad ""novel"" will soon be forgotton..."
1,"why, why, why, why, why?","Why muck with a classic of one medium, try to force it into another, and then make matters worse by telling us what happened after the fadeout when a key reason CASABLANCA is so popular is that we all have our own ideas of what happened later."
3,Not completely bad,"I have always loved ""Casablanca,"" so I decided to give ""As Time Goes By"" a try. It had its good points as well as its bad. I must agree with others that it was lacking in emotion. It seemed that Walsh was so concerned with facts and with making everything fit together properly that he forgot Rick and Ilsa. I loved the way that Rick was portrayed in the movie. He pretended to ""stick my neck out for nobody,"" while in reality, he would risk his life and happiness for those he loved. In the book, he acts only out of selfishness, and won't allow Ilsa to be a heroine. I did like the way that Walsh tied in real life events (Ilsa's birthday was the date of Ingrid Bergman's death), but I did not find the book satisfying as a sequal to the movie."
2,Not an abject failure,"This book is blessed with an interesting storyline and uses historical references quite well to tie itself into World War Two. There's one basic problem, however. Its success hinges upon Rick following Ilsa through Portugal to London, which in my estimetion devalues his self-sacrifice at the end of the movie Casablanca. The ending of the movie is valueless, in my opinion, without Rick having to knowingly give up Ilsa in favor of the greater cause, but herein he's simply separated from her for a little while. Worth skipping if you want to keep the mystique of the movie alive in your mind."
3,Desecration of a classic; not bad as a novel,"It has almost nothing to do with the movie except stealing a few great lines and using them poorly. As a novel, I could have gone with it if it hadn't been totally contrary charachter wise to Casablanca. If you don't know much about the movie, it is nice brain candy. (took me 5 hrs), but if you want a suitable sequel, look elsewhere, such as your imagination."
3,A fun read If not taken too Serious.,"Casablanca is a Classic not to be messed with! BUT, because of the love I have for the characters, I did enjoy envisioning them coming to life once again. At first I was worried that the story could change my views of the original movie. After reading it I realized it's really not a bad story, which could be the bases and conclusion for the main story. Walsh does stick closely to the feel of the movie. I think if you love the story, and just crave more, you should read the book. Just as long as no movie is made!"
1,A terrible sequel,"I know that writing is difficult, and I look for the good things in a book. But I really thought that this one completely failed to capture the magic of Casablanca. The characters, the settings; you could have put different names in the story, and it wouldn't remind you of ""Casablanca"" at all. I think that Time-Warner wanted to make a buck on the renewed interest in Casablanca and put this out. You'd get a better ""Bogart"" story by reading Dashiell Hammett's ""The Maltese Falcon"" or Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep."""
1,Murderer! Murderer! Imagination Killer!,"I echo the comments made by Kevin Nenstiel and would like to add that in direct contradiction to the end of the movie which left much to the imagination, the end of the book sews up every single loose thread ad nauseum. I resent the fact that Ilsa is hinted to have slept with Rick after she knew Victor was alive. Victor is reduced to a simpering vengeful coward who is taken in by the British, and Renault's political conversion is demoralized."
3,"A good, imaginative yarn","Apparently I enjoyed this book more than some others. I was a young teenager when 'Casablanca' was first released. I thought then - and still do - that it was a remarkable love story with a war setting. It was a film that grew better with the passing of time. But, I have never worshipped the film or the story.Walsh's novel, As Time Goes By, refreshed my memories and added an exceptional new twist to the character's background and to what just might have been in store for them after they parted so dramatically.I enjoyed the book and recommend it to others."
1,"Poorly written, unconvincing development of characters.","This is a bad book. The characters you know from Casablanca transform radically - for unknown reasons, and extremely unconvincingly - into someone else. Rick takes sides and becomes involved in a lunatic plot, with Laszlo becoming his co-conspirator and SHE the super-spy, infiltrating the enemy. Please. On top of it, it is very poorly written, some dialogues actually hurt. No good."
2,"good, but not amamzing","I think this book didi a good job of capturing the spirit of the movie, but fell a little short in the execution. I am glad I now know where Ilsa and Rick came from, but somehow the book just doesn't do the original story justice."
4,DID SEEM TO MAKE DIFFEANCE,USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 6 MONTHS AND NOTICED A DIFFEANCE IN HAIR GROWTH AND COLOR I AM STILL USING IF AMONST FRIENDS
3,Hair Loss,I hoped this product would help my hair loss. I took the whole bottle but didn't really noticed a difference. I think my hair loss is from messed up hormones. It might work for others. I heard it has helped some women.
3,Did no harm,I read this helped in an article and gave it a try. I received as advertsied and took the entire bottle (not at one time;). I noticed no positive or negative effects. I would not buy again only because it did nothing for me.
4,Ok but,Everybody is different. I tried it but it did not really do what I expected. I was hoping it would help tinnitus. I don't think I will order another bottle.My recommendation is to try it. I found Turmeric was more effective. I used it to help build resistance against the flu. I think I avoided the flu taking Turmeric and extra C.
2,it really works,"I have just started using fo-ti in addition to eleuthero all by natures way for four days now and I am experiencing its effectiveness. my lower back pain, knee pain and light headness are reduced. i hope by the time I finish one bottle each evertthing will disappear.My heart has also stopped palpitating. i did not experince any diarrhea from using the fo-ti rootI am from Ghana"
4,"No visible results yet, but no harm done",Someone in their review mentioned the product contained magnesium stearate and gelatin (animal derived). This is absolutely correct. To work around this (sounds stupid) but I remove the powder off the capsule and ingest only the powder. The magnesium stearate is in the capsule and not in the powder. I avoid animal derived products as well so this is the best work around for me.
3,Picirilli's worst,"Well written, as usual, but stretched to the limit, the end result being that it gets rather boring and full of unnecessary details.The plot is okay, the characters are typical Picirilli characters, but the pace, my God, what happened to the pace?! It plods on and on untill we reach the end we crave for.I guess a master writer has the right to underperform; I still swear fealty, in any case, having read so many wonderfull books by this Author."
5,Another fantastic book from Tom Piccirilli,"This is perhaps Piccirilli's most mainstream novel to date but that doesn't mean it lacks any of the quirky characteristics of his earlier work. The Dead Letters is still chock full of odd characters caught up in surreal situations, all told in the unique and lovely voice that so many have come to adore. I highly reccomend this book to new and old fans alike, anybody looking for a great, dark story with real wit and style."
5,"Solid Gold, a Glittering Gem","In my long lifetime, I have read dozens of books about how to write. Some have been marginally helpful, some have been amusing, some have been frustrating. Not one, however, has told me--clearly and convincingly--HOW to write. That changed when I picked up Caroline Joy Adams' ""The Power to Write."" This book is solid gold, a glittering gem. Ms. Adams begins by building the reader's self-confidence, which she calls Key 1 (""Know That You Have the Power to Write""). She then explains and illustrates--with six additional keys and writing samples--the steps to producing quality, high-energy, inspired writing.I treasure this book. I think it's the best of its genre on the market. And it comes with a bonus--Ms. Adams' elegant calligraphy. Bravo!"
2,Not that good,"I, too, stumbled upon this book on the bargain table. I am giving it two stars for a couple of ideas I gleaned from this slim book but I'm SO glad I didn't pay full price! I think it would have benefited from story examples by other, better writers. The author used only her own stories and ... she's not a good writer. Long, convoluted rambling sentences - more than once I had to start reading the piece again to try and figure out what the heck she was trying to say. When she said in ""March Morning"" that the police would not look for her missing baby for 24 or 48 hours or some such nonsense, she lost me completely. Obviously she's been sniffing too much ink. When a child or baby is involved, ANY law enforcement agency in this country would immediately start a search. So, if read it you much - try and find a copy at the library - or in the bargain bin."
2,Cumbersome to say the least,"I thought Civ 2 was slow to play when you got up in the advanced stages but this takes the cake. It's also very bloated on my hard drive. The interface and the game play is cumbersome and missing a lot of *autopilot* features that would help things a lot (if there is a city governor, you wouldn't know it by looking) Nice units and maps but the tech logic seems spurious. Wait for this game to hit the Sales Bin of your local walmart (or here if the animal exists ;-)) and don't pay full price."
1,LINUX Civ Call-to-Power doesn't work,"Sounded like a great LINUX program - but loading/installing instructions poor. Once I got it installed, than setup it crashed back to desktop was soon I I clicked play. Since it was a gift - a real downer! When I went on Internet for hints, found many had the same problem - crash to Desktop when attempted to play. All the websites with patches were down.Civilization: Call to Power"
2,Feel very different from CivII,"If your looking for CivIII then this isn't it. Completely different feel to the game, such that even as an MAJOR fan of CivII, I have not liked this at all. Game play seems slower.On the good side the game adds new units with new powers, new givernments etc."
4,The graphics and advancements totally outweigh the porblems,"The game play is average for Civ games, you need patince, stamina, and above all time. These games are very time consuming and somtimes very adicting. You will need superior tactical skills to play this game, it is a bit harder then the rest. The Comp. usually cheats in the harder levels, but not to the degree that I will need to whine about it. And it sux when the terrorist ruin your Wonders without you knowing about it. But if your having that hard of a time with it, cheat.It is a dirty some what unrealistict fighting atmosphere, where horse men and warriors can attact futuristic battalion and win. But if the game is all that hard, I guess you wern't picked to rule the world, so don't whine."
2,2 1/2..Best of isnt really the best of,"Coal Chamber had a great sound with their first album, and even though they were in the same class as Deftones and Korn (at the time) they took Nu Metal to maxium with Dez's Great vocal range. There is just a few good cuts off of this Best Of CD, and you can really feel the difference between Coal Chambers older and newer material. The newer material is what really ruins this album, and probely is what ruined Coal Chamber. I suggest if you want a better feel for the band and a more ""Vocal"" Dez, then stick with the first 2 releases."
2,Not enough info to buy,There really needs to be information on these sorts of products on the amount contained in the jar. Many people like to know how much per ounce they are buying.
4,Rules for the way Golf should be played.,"I love Golf. It's the Rules I don't get. I mean none of us are Tiger Woods ... After 8 strokes just pick the ball up. Who cares who closest to the hole , Just putt the ball. That said ,The Official Exceptions to the Rules of Golf is a book made for the way I play golf. If more people follow these rules maybe I could get a round in in less than 3 hours!"
4,Very entertaining but not excellent..,This game must be played by everyone at least once. It set the standard for the hack and slash genre ported to console. Although not as entertaining as some similar type of games that followed I still enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone.
2,Couldn't finish this one,"Like another reviewer, I just could't get into this one, although I tried repeatedly. The writing didn't flow for me, making the story difficult to follow, and I just didn't find the characters that interesting. Too many sterotypes as well. I finally gave up on trying to find out what Vera's Point is."
4,How Timely...,"What an excellent first novel. Just when society thinks being gay is cool...here's a wake up call. the author makes us all keenly aware that simply loving another human being has risks that the majority of society doesn't face, let alone even know about. Like HB751. Perkinson draws the reader in using characters we can all relate to, yet forces us to think in new ways (dual destiny). A great read!"
2,Couldn't get it to it,"Sorry, I just could not get in to this book. Her attempt at humor just did not click with me although I noticed the other reviewer enjoyed the book. I suggest you buy it second hand and then you make your decision. Frankly, a lesbian writter who uses ""sexual preferance"" seems rather out dated. As if we had a ""preference""...orientation is much more acurate."
1,It sucks,"The bands are no-namers, which wouldn't have been a problem if they had the guts to do daring interpretations of the songs. Instead all we get are Bowie songs that will make you wish you were listening to the originals instead... I could not recommend this album to anyone. Don't buy it."
4,Some good tracks but overall it is only 52 minutes long,"I am a Loop Guru fan and have waited long for a new album to come out. When I first listened to this, I was a little disapointed but on a second and third listening it got a lot better. Overall it is missing a direction that most of the others seem to have. Since this is a remix of a previous release I hope that they are working on new material for another release soon."
4,yard butler weeder,"I purchased the weeder thinking it was something other than what it turned out to be. However, when I started using it, I found it did remove yard weeds very well. My gardners saw the weeder & started using it. They then wanted to know where to buy it!"
2,There must be better options,"The design is fine, in terms of the prong location and angle...but there are two serious problems with this:1. The handle slips off and so you have to push it back down all the time.2. The prongs bend very easily; so far, I can just bend them back into place with a pair of pliers, but at some point, they are just going to fall off. This is only about 2 months old, and I just use it on regular soil with a moderate amount of small rocks. Doing that, I'll have to unbend the prongs after maybe 20 minutes of use.There's surely a better weeder product out there."
2,There are better products like that out there.,"It is fairly heavy, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the cover on the handle slides off so easily that it's impossible to do any work with it. Plus the 'hoe' part of it is smaller than in similar products. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the 'weed pulling' end of it works pretty well."
5,Great brand!,"My first bottle of these softgels was from the local health food store. I purchased a bottle of 90 and paid more than I did for this bottle of 180. It is high quality oil that is a combo of fish oil, flaxseed oil and borage oil. It contains a high concentration of EFA, DHA, omega 3, 6 and 9. There is no fishy after-taste or horrible fish burps from this brand. There are no directions on how to take this supplement, but 3 softgels are considered one serving. I have found through trial and error, to take one pill at a time with food. If you take more than 1 at a time, it may cause an adverse reaction (diarrhea). I would recommend this brand and will purchase it again."
4,More impressive oin computer screen,I wasn't as impressed by it when I actually got them. But it's o.k.
2,Jewelry is stained after only minimal wear!,"The piece is beautiful and it's comfortable to wear, looks GREAT. But after only a couple months the pendant is worn out looking and stained. Looks awful. I won't wear it anymore."
3,For those small-towners at heart,"So I am a sucker for all those downhome novels celebrating small-town life. Oh well. This book fits that niche of mine well as it blatantly declares to the world that even the most simple of places may be hiding something extraordinary. Granted, the discoveries made here would probably be the mock and scorn of more civilized areas, but they held a sweetly strong spirit that appealed to my sense of story-telling. The writing is bright, cheerful, and expressive. I was impressed by the assortment of well-drawn characters complete with their personal drama, humor, and mysteries. I expected a pretty caged plot, but the story was loose enough, depending on its characters with their individual stories, to let itself become entrenched in emotions. It's not at the level of Kate DiCamillo or Richard Peck, but Ms. Birney did make something pretty darn sweet."
1,awful my son hated this book,this has to be one of the worst books in the universe. it is so boring. it would be tourture if you made your children read this. do NOT get this book.
5,Memories of My Youth,"This book by Ms. Maistros brought back so many images of my younger days. I grew up in New England during this era and could identify with many of the visual images that she created with the book. I can remember the cold and snow. We share the same ethnic background and family customs. As I read this piece I would laugh out loud. Thank you Ms. Maistros for giving me a portal back to my youth, to a time when we thought life was tough. If we had only known what was to come. I too appreciate that life."
2,cheaply made grill,"My older Meco grill was built much better than this one. There is alot thinner metal on this new grill. It is not as sturdy and the metal gives more. It is alot lighter than my older one. It cost twice as much as my old one but, it was made alot cheaper. It is hard telling how long this one is going to last. Keep this in mind if you want to buy one of these. I was very disappointed with this grill."
4,Great Grill for the Price,"Meco, a great American-made grill at a reasonable price. I have purchased Meco grills for the past 25 years and have never been dissatisfied. This current grill has lasted 5 years and is still going strong.This model, while excellent, could benefit from a wooden fold-out tray on one side. Those models are available, but at a greater price.If you don't need a wooden fold-out tray to hold plates or barbecue accessories, then this is a fine grill with three air-vent ports, and three levels of heat over your charcoal.A bargain for those of us who still enjoy the taste of real charcoal grilling."
2,"clever design, but...","I read the numerous reviews with paticular regard to the lack of locking nuts but took a chance and ordered it figuring that (a) they would have rectified this problem by now--11/2010--or (b) Amazon would have stopped selling a product they know to be defective. A 20-minute call to Meco may have resulted in my receiving the missing parts, or not. Other reviewers were correct--the instructions were virtually worthless. Given that these were not her issues, my wife used it last night and loved it--but I get to do the reinstall if and when (2 weeks) the missing parts arrive, so I can't recommend this otherwise satisfactory item or similar grills, and Amazon should stop selling them."
3,You can do better.,"I bought this shovel along with the ""Union Tools ToughBuilt"" shovel that Amazon sells, and this is not the winner. This shovel has its handle connected to the head of the shovel via fiberglass. The Union Tools shovel has piece of tubular steel that connects the two parts making a far stronger shovel. I would be scared to stand on this Seymour shovel and give a good yank: it might snap in two. In addition, if you watch, the Union Tools shovel is usually cheaper than this one."
2,big disappointment,"wow. this is horrible. i love Gene's past records and have been following them as a fan since their debt Olympian; but there is barely anything here that has any feeling or any sign of musical substance. the only songs that i can halfway enjoy are the opening ""Let Me Move On"" and the closing number ""Somewhere In The World.""the remainder of these songs just sound completely dull, flat, contrived, and just plain uninspired. Martin Rossiter's voice seems to be strained and weak and his lyrics are even weaker. especially on the turgid crap songs like ""From Georgia To Osaka"" and the laughable ""We'll Get What We Deserve"" where he tries to write an anthem to the working class citizen; with lines like: ""we party so hard and we work even harder."" all of this sung over a faux-reggae backdrop...no kidding! it's that bad!Gene, i ask you: what happened here?"
1,"Gene, Gene, Gene - What were you thinking","This CD is borderline awful!! ""Olympian"" and ""Drawn to the Deep End"" were both fantastic CD's. Something happened on this one. I did not get the ""Revelations"" CD but I have a feeling based on another review it is similar to this one. The first two albums, which were basically the Smiths of the 90's, were brilliant, send shivers up you spine, works of art - Classics - Epiphany recordings. However, since I last heard Gene, they changed their style - tried to get away from all the Smiths comparisons - Yikes!!, If this is what you get?? I will tell you that Gene is a brilliant band and would love to see them in concert - Hopefully they would not play too many songs from this album. It has little to no emotion compared to their early works. However, the opening song ""Let me move on"" IS the early Gene and should be downloaded at once if you are a true Gene Fan."
2,Not my favorite Uggs . . .,"These are not as comfortable as other UGGs I have. There is a strong possibility that these are knockoffs - the lining, supposedly shearling, feels manmade. All in all, I should have saved my money and gone to the UGGs store at the mall. Disappointing!"
2,disappointed,"The authors, due to space considerations, do not include the nature and source of incomes used for their comparisons. Without this information, how can one determine if they fit the profile used.Without knowing the amounts of various sources of incomes used,I find the book of little use."
4,A good PC game overall but needs a powerfull system,"Sure its a little dumbed down for the console crowd, but its still fun. Word of warning it does take a good computer to run it well. I dont think it supports SLi yet but it should be patched in soon enough. There is a trick to get the SLi to work though. After I did that I was able to up the settings a bit and still get decent frames. I was a huge fan of the Raven Shield series and I wasnt to dissapointed with this game."
2,Terrible graphics and performance,"I was kind of stunned when I first started playing the game. Everything looked dull and flat. FEAR and GRAW look 10X better and a lot smoother.I was getting very low framerates with my 8800GTX, Intel Core 2 Duo at 3.2Ghz and 2 Gb of RAM.Graphics are nasty along with performance. Poor coding I guess."
2,Weird,"Well, i never really got to play the game on my computer because my computer has Windows Vista, and the game requires it not to have Windows Vista. And it also required other stuff that i had to buy in order to play the game. But my friend has it and and i was o.k. But, if you really like violence a lot, the this is a game to purchase."
1,Serious problems,"This is the only time I have ever felt screwed over by Amazon. They provide NO info on system requirements for the game. After trying to run it on numerous machines unsuccessfully, I now have a system powerful enough to run it and I cannot get activation codes from Ubisoft, the publisher. Their site which is supposed to resolve these issues does not load at all. If I had known exactly how demanding this game was with hardware I would have waited to buy it. Now I have it and a PC that will run it and the game refuses to load, and the company's support is worthless."
1,Unplayable,Please note that this game will not run unless you have a top of the line video card. It would not work with a Nvidia GeForce 6200 card.
2,Miserable,"Good graphics, lots of action, an ending that is impossible without a lot of luck or cheating. After trying to finish for the 25th time, I wiped the game from my hard drive. Will never play again. Games should be fun and a little hard, not hard to the point of pure luck. Some of the fights are totally un-realistic. In real life, they would be suicide."
5,Let's fire Las Vegas up!,"Great graphics, great story line, lots and lots of action, great combat system, and actually your teammates are not that stupid!The game it's great, it gives you a lot of options to approach your missions, from stealth to rock and roll.Certainly awaiting the second release"
3,TO BE CONTINUED,"No Ending. Thanks Ubisoft. To Be Continued. Weak! The graphics are great and the weapons are fun. The AI is weak and your team says the same things over and over again. Annoying. The levels are straight forward and bland. Dantes Inferno is the worst level and they saved it for the end of the Vegas levels. This game could have been 5 stars with better AI, a lot more sayings from team mates, more civilians running away and maybe some good one liners, and an ENDING! TO BE CONTINUED ... what a rip."
2,Should Be Called Rainblow Sux Mexico,"I am a fan of the Rainbow Six series, and this game falls way short. If you want this game, get the 360 version. Its a direct port from the 360, but its very disappointing on the pc.Gameplay: You play forever in the streets of Mexico. This game should be called Mexico, because you play the first 2 hours there. Controls are basically the same as other games, but there is no jumping. What were they thinking. You can't jump over stuff, without being pressed against it first. This really took away from gameplay for me.Graphics: Vegas on the 360 is very impressive, but on the pc its not. It sux even with with my 8600GTS overclocked. There is no AA option, and the game looks very dark. After you get in Vegas it looks better, but all the Mexico stuff just doesn't look good.Don't bother getting this game because its not worth the $$$. Get one of the older ones instead. Ubisoft laid an egg with this 360 port."
4,Tom Clancy always a good choice,I have been playing Rainbow Six games for a long time. I always have a good time with these games.
3,New Era,"Its a good game for a console tactical shooter, i origionaly had this for xbox360, and it was fun, challenging and the graphics seemed great. I got it for pc, thinking it would be that much better, but its the exact same game, graphics and control system as console. its pretty obvious who the developers are advertising to now and days.. other than the fact that the pc version is obviously just an offspring of the console game, its challenging and fun, the ai gets repetative and sometimes doesn't initalize, so you have sitting targets..if they'd put more time into gameplay it would be a good game, get it on console if you have the chance."
5,Extremely informative book -- from cover to cover!,"Miniter's pen is mighty! He provides evidence and includes sources which has enabled me to become better informed, and that's what it's all about. Everyone should read his books. He has what it takes to report as it should be done not as the topic of the book states is."
4,Disinformation,"I am 80 years old, and have read all my life, but only became interested in politics when I could vote at 21. Now I wish I could be president, or raise a son to be, or a grandson to be!! I don't read much fiction anymore and this was a very interesting read, and it makes me sick when people do not stand for this Country and the boys who are fighting for it. I will try to keep up on the latest things. Thanks for sending it fast"
1,Biased drivel,Minter is yet another biased hack who portrays himself as being unbiased and an investigative journalist when his role is to be a lackey for the right-wing. The man went to Vassar- what a waste of a fine education. Avoid this book if you are looking for the truth.
1,Right wing crappola,"Saddam had 17 violations against him and Israel has thrice that amount, each time aided by the veto power of the United States.What happened when Saddam gassed the Iranians and the Kurds? Rumsfeld went and shook his hands. They simply did not care! The current regime all of a sudden took pity on the people of Iraq, just decided to go *liberate* them? Oh yeah.If there were all these ""evidences"" linking Al-Qaeda and Iraq, how come they havent been exposed to the citizenry yet? Come on, show us something!The truth is, Iraq is a gashing wound and the Al-Qaeda maggots have *now* gone there. IF that was the intention, to create a bleeding wound to attract insects, I'm afraid the tactic has worked very well indeed. Iraqi citizens be damned.Minter dude, good try though."
1,Independent author or Government egg?,Disinformation is indeed disinformation. Save your money and get a good book! If I could get my money back I would!
2,Who do you believe?,"If any author researches enough, he/she can find a source to back up just about anything. Do we believe Minter or do we believe others who have sources that say the opposite? Can he possibly have found all of the sources of information to debunk these ""myths?"" It's a slightly entertaining book in the research of terrorism. But in the end, to stop terrorism, we(Americans)need to give the world less economic empirialism and more humanitarianism. Who's going to bomb nice guys? Why isn't Canada terrorized? Wouldn't Muslim extremists go after the Vatican if it was just about religion? I think these are the important questions to answer."
1,"""Disinformation"" says it all","It is an aptly named book. Why? Because this book is FULL of disinformation. Just another book written to perpetuate the lie of why we ""need"" the so-called ""war on terrah"". All of the ""myths"" this author outlines have already been debunked over and over again by better researchers via other publications."
1,Just what America needs. More rabble rousing.,Miniter takes advantage of the American ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole. Maybe he could get together for a book with Ann Coulter?
3,T. Murphy..nice try with your tripe,"T. Murphy's review above (1 star out of 5) is laughable. Check his other reviews and...lo and behold he gave an absolutely GUSHING review of ""The Lies of George W. Bush"". Yeah....what an objective reader. This book has its pros and cons, but you can't take the 1 out of 5 review of a clearly closed minded partisan robot like T. Murphy seriously.T. Murphy..you have been weighed...you have been meausured....you have been found wanting.Try again...."
3,Broken zipper,I got the Green set and i was absolutely thrilled when i got it as i was all ready for my trip back to Trinidad. when i attempted to start packing i observed the broken zipper on the bigger of the 2 suitcases. In summary it was practically unusable and it was a clear reflection of the price paid.
3,Lime green luggage not as pictured,"I got the product and it is lime green with BLACK trim and handles. It looks nothing like the picture and nothing on the luggage is gray. The largest suitcase I got also has a noticeable rip on the top corner. Overall the luggage is ok. Quality is not great, but the price was cheap. Bealls Florida will not refund any of my money for wrong items/damaged product unless I want to return the items and pay for the return shipping myself. That would leave me with less money and still no luggage. Poor customer service and lack of ownership on their part. I would not buy from them again."
3,Looks fun but not the best quality,"I purchased this for my girlfriend for her birthday. She's a huge cowboys fan and we really needed to get some helmets of our favorite teams in the house. She also loves to host parties and make snacks like chili and cheese dip and smokies and all that stuff. This would be perfect right? Not really... The construction is really flimsy and the lid falls off all the time. The stripes are just two pieces of tape and they aren't straight. And the front of the helmet, where the food goes, is kind of awkward to use because it really doesn't hold much and reaching in there to ""load up"" just makes a mess. This thing now sits on a shelf proudly displaying the cowboys logo as a funny looking helmet and not much else."
3,just ok,i bought this a christmas present and i wil say i was disappointed. the chip holder and the trays are pretty small and it's made out of cheap plastic. i would not recommend it to anybody
4,Very cool!,"I was worried it wouldn't be large enough to fit a good amount of snacks, but to my delightful suprize its actually pretty big. Can't wait for football season to roll back around now and use this thing!"
5,Jaguar Snack Helment,This is a great item my son is a Jaguar fan he uses this item to store his fan cards or small items of collection. He takes the helment with him when he goes on play dates with his friends they all all love it. It was one of the best items i've every bought for him.
5,A must have for any Lions football fan!,"My boyfriend loved this gift. When it's not in use and filled with snacks when he's watching Deteoit sports, it sits right on his end table next to his couch. It also doubles as a great conversation piece"
4,"Good, but missing something","It's still TFF but without Curt there. Something's just seems a little bit off not enough to knock this CD too much. As the writing is still as strong as ever and the vocals on various tracks are what keep me interested in Elemental...really enjoyed the last track ""Goodnight Song"" more than most of the others. But they are pretty good in there own right. Nice one."
2,Oh Please,"The only remotely inspired thing on this morose album is Fish Out Of Water, not that I have nothing against Curt. (He took it in his stride - calling himself a happy fish! A welcome riposte to what was then the pompous Orzabal - probably his defense mechanism of a lack of his former brilliance as a songsmith).Come on guys, like most great bands they had their 3 brilliant first albums (this 4th not being one of them), and it's time to let go.Nothing they ever did individually or together after Seeds could touch their first 3.Even the initially catching Break It Down Again exposes big holes in the songwriting after repeated listens - unlike anything in their first 3 this sounds just dated.Tears For Fears, like the Beatles, is gone. Get over it. Every few years dust off The Hurting, Big Chair and Seeds, and prepared to be amazed like yore. And that's more than enough."
3,"All and all,...it cannot compare to the earlier TFF","I think that Roland Orzabal is an amazing singer/songwriter but he seems to have lost his focus with this album. The songs are kind of weird in my opinion (""Dog's a best friend's dog""?)and the sound is lacking from the days of classic TFF in the 80's. ""Cold"", and ""Fish out of water"" are great songs and the album DOES grow on you after a while but it is quite unispired compared to past efforts ( I am a diehard TFF fan but I must admit this )Maybe I feel this way because all of the delightful melancholy and cynicism that was the forefront of ""The Hurting"" and ""Songs from the Big Chair"" simply isn't there; in fact there isn't really ANY theme to this album really. It's a good cd to have if you're a serious fan of Roland Orzabal but don't expect too much out of this one."
2,Less than a sum of its elements,"Roland Orzabal was always the main singer and songwriter for the group, but after listening to Elemental, I wondered if I had been underestimating Curt Smith's contributions. The sweeping production is impressive, but it only serves to distract from the thinness of the material. Only ""Fish Out Of Water"" and ""Power"" have melodies strong enough to stand on their own."
4,"""When the going gets tough...""","Let's be honest, Roland is one of the good guys. He speaks from the still point inside of him and this is his talent. TFF is still one of the bands that you grab off the shelf without even thinking about the possibility that it might not be good. It is always a nutritious experience. No more Kurt, Roland moves on seeking answers for the unanswerable like a warrior."
3,"Honest, soulful work.","Somewhere in my upper half of TfF catalog. Gritty, honest work that has some definite inspired moments. Album seems uneven with strong tracks and some forgettables."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE DECADE,A SURPRISINGLY ADULT RECORD FOR THOSE WHO REMEMBER WHEN TALENT AND ABILITY OVERODE MARKETABILITY. AN DISK FOR A TRUE FAN SEEKING GROWTH AND MATURITY FOR HIS MUSIC COLLECTION.
5,Wow this album is addictive!! Great Job Roland!!,"I have been a huge fan of tears for fears and I am a bit late with this review. Elemental is my all time favorite TFF album. It proved to us tears for fears was Roland Orzabal only. I am more than convinced curt smith was no more than a backup singer who cared about his looks(fish out of water) more than music. The elemental concert was wonderful, and curt smith was not missed at all. Rolands album Raoul and the kings of spain is a masterpiece as well. I am happy curt and roland are friends again, but I hope roland doesnt put up with him like in the past, because he doesnt need him. We found that out in Elemental."
3,Hot and cold,"3 1/2Elemental remains the sleek early 90's production job it initially sounded of, though can putter off on autopilot, while vocals grow increasingly grating, in its cheesier moments. Thankfully, TFF never leave entire songs stranded for too long, with mushy pace often subsided by broad electronic strokes to help clear the palate when needed."
1,save your money,"for hardcore tff fans only. orzabal has balls to go on without curt smith. unfortunately, his brains can no longer keep up--the old stylistic skill remains, but the inspiration is gone. be warned, unless you think vh1 is cutting edge."
3,he almost pulled it off,"While it's not a concept album as such, ELEMENTAL does seem to flow musically. Still, it sounds like an unfinished album. ""Gas Giants,"" ""Power"", and ""Brian Wilson Said"" sort of just meander together with no apparent point-- they would have been best left separate. Sometimes, meandering works, though. ""Mr. Pessimist,"" even though it has several different sections, darkly mutters thru the best six minutes on the album. When he's focused, Roland nails songs like the title track, ""Cold,"" ""Dog's A Best Friend's Dog,"" and ""fish."" More of that, and a little more cohesiveness, would have made this the ""Sgt. Pepper"" that TFF tried for (and had already almost achieved on SEEDS OF LOVE, anyway). Nevertheless, like all TFF, this is an album well worth owning and still better than 99 percent of what's on the radio today."
4,good book,"Great book, I didn't read it, my brother is the one that wants the book, he said he read it in the library, and after finished it, he wanted to buy one to keep it..."
4,acting choice,"i thought that this was a realitively decent movie, and watched it in 2011, after sheryl (aka Lisa Niles) had a 2 1/2 year stint on a soap that i have been watching since the 60's, general hospital. i think its wierd to see an actress that is nearly or is killed, raped, tortured, or murderous on one movie, then in a show like a show or reality tv."
2,"Commonsense advice, but author's heros sell dubious products","If you believe Cohen, all the people who ever hit it big in ""mail-order"" did it selling some sort of ""how-to"" books (Hmmmmmm . . . . .). There is some useful information here, but it is not a guide to becoming the next L.L. Bean or Amazon.com. If you have studied marketing and business in general, you don't need this."
2,Outdated,This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today.
3,Mail Order is Still a Good Business,"Today there are many new channels for building a mail order business. Much of it online. I own this book, and many others, but I like the information from the National Mail Order Association (NMOA) the best. It's produced by mail order practitioners, not research writers."
1,terrible packaging,"The birds eat the stuff, the only reason it isn't a 0-rating.The ""easy-peel"" packages are totally worthless - 90% of the packages are sealed so tightly that it is impossible to open the pack without using a knife and getting greasy-gunk all over the place. A simple baggie would create far less mess, and be easy to open without requiring tools. The only reason I can think of to create such a lousy package is that they pour the hot suet directly into the lower tray of the pack, and thus save time at the expense of consumer annoyance.I will never buy a Heath-brand suet product again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone but an enemy."
5,Flexible and focused,"I loved having software that allowed you to choose which nursing topic (peds, cardiovascular, substance abuse, etc.) or nursing process (assessment, evaluation, planning, etc.) subject to focus on! I could really concentrate on the areas I needed help in, and rationales are provided for each answer, including why the wrong answer is wrong (usually they just say why the right one is right). This was my biggest help in preparing for the NCLEX."
3,average,"These guy's sure seem to have learned to party. I think that this cd, while it has some good points is on the whole very average. I much prefer the later stylings of ""Lets Face It"" but if you're a MMB fan, it's well worth the cash."
4,Good Ska for a Groove.,"Its not 2-tone, its not strict 3rd wave. Its Bosstones! I love it, and I live for it. The vocals aint exactly Sinatra, but who cares. This is damn good! YEA!"
1,Great band - bad album,I'm a huge BossTone's fan and this was the last one to buy for my collection but I was VERY DISAPPOINTED! No wonder the used copies are dirt-cheap. Very little ska influence in this one :(
5,Unbelievable,"This is one of the best albums I own. If this did not have ""A man without"" and ""What was was over,"" it would be a perfect cd. Songs like ""Don't know how to party,"" ""Holy smoke,"" and ""Anything goes"" show just how incredible the Bosstones are. This cd is absolutely phenomenal. The horn section is really tight, Nate's inventive guitar playing is obvious, and Dicky's voice is at a pefect growl. Buy this, you couldn't possibly regret it."
2,Too Pricy,"Churches of Rome covers only a small amount of the 800 Houseof God in the Eternal City. The presentation is good and coversthe history of the edifices.I give two stars for this book for two reasons, only few churchesare covered and the hefty price for such book. Several literaturesexist that discuss more of the Houses of God in Rome but for acheaper price."
4,BEVELED TOLIET SEAT REVIEW,THIS IS NICE & GOOD FOR THE PRICE. I LIKE THE CHROME HINGES. MORE SANITARY.
4,Women in Hip Hop,"Women in hip hop get their due. This book covers a lot, but focuses on a chosen few. It is the only book of its kind that I am aware of. For anyone interested in getting a broad overview of mainstream (for the most part)women in hip hop I suggest purchasing this book. A must for any hip hop head because we all know that ""The ladies run this mutha!"""
4,"solid, stable, but Buggy??","This monitor has the capabilities that you would expect for business and home use alike, it doesn't produce much heat and you won't worry about cutting the power to let it cool down or anything, and there is a sufficiently large area for gamers, CG artists, etc... to work with,simple and nice on-screen configuration panel, just like the older Compaq productsThis monitor is also compatible with any software combination I've tested, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the problem that I have experienced and that I don't know exactly if it's a bug in the whole brand or just in my monitor, the viewable area seems to stretch differently in different resolutions and I can't fix that no matter how I tamper with the configuration panelSo If your gonna buy this you better test it thouroughly!!!"
4,Blue Cheer - 'Outsideinside' (Mercury) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in late 1968, this was their follow-up to their debut,'Vincebus Eruptum' record(see my review). It was also the second and FINAL album with their original guitarist,Leigh Stephens. Tracks here that I thought more than carried their own were their semi-Hendrix like ""Sun Cycle"",""Just A Little Bit"",""Gypsy Ball"",their so-so Stones cover ""Satisfaction"" and ""Babylon"". My only regret is that I guess I should've purchased that 2-lp's on-1 CD pressing of these two titles I've seen recently. A good classic late '60's hard rock title to own just the same.Recommended."
5,A glimpse into the reality of life in the Middle East,Dr.Hourani brilliantly describes both the history of the Middle East conflict and it's effect on generations of families. The story of his family is so vividly told that one feels that he wishes to know them. I couldn't put the book down. It is a real page-turner.
1,The worst of the worst...,"Not only has she NO uniqueness in her style, but her voice sounds like a squirel's voice. She should be taken off this web-site. She's horrible!"
4,Torx Bit Set,"This was purchased as a Christmas Gift for my son in law.I honestly have no way to personally rate it, therefore, I base my review on 'others' and the look on his face. <~ He had none and had to borrow a set from his father.Recommended"
1,Check torque ratings,"I ordered this set specifically for the T40 bit, in order to change out the arms on my Herman Miller Mirra chair. The chair doesn't use the secure type of Torx bit, just the regular Torx kind, but I ordered the secure kind for future flexibility.On my very first attempt to unfasten the arms, the T40 bit sheared clean off about 1/3 of the way down the shaft. That's pretty poor...So buyer beware - these may be okay for very low torque applications, but I question the quality given my experience."
3,Broke on first use.,"I used the T45 socket to remove two roll bar bolts on my CJ-7 and it seemed fine. On the third bolt it sheared. They look nice but they are clearly a light duty tool. Ordered a craftsman replacement as I need one that is going to hold up, I am in the middle of a restoration."
5,One Great set of Torx Bit Sockets,"What a deal and great value for the price, could not find anything for lower price than here on Amazon for these type of sockets and they work with all types of Torx socket fittings. I highly recommend these, I have used them repeatedly on cars and trucks to work on and have no problems at all, still look like new and fit well. And for less than half the price at major retailers I am completely satisfied."
3,okay book,tells the story of some pampered sons of the south who wanted to play soldier and that is all that they did - play
3,Disappointing,"As much as I have loved listening to Gary Peacock over the decades, this dvd has low educational value. Gary's ideas are either too general, as in the discussion of posture, or too obscure and poorly expressed, as in most of the rest. Having said that, it provides the welcome opportunity to see and hear Gary play, and this is something I have wanted to do since hearing Voices long ago. I do not regret buying the dvd for this reason. Perhaps a practicing jazz musician would be able to glean more information from Gary's tips, and perhaps even I will after a second viewing. The acoustic bass is a favorite instrument, though, and it was a pleasure to see and hear Gary at work."
2,incorrectly named,"It should be named ""how to writing SQL for MS Access, Oracle 7i and xxx"" since that is all about. It is weird to me why ""Design"" is in the title. There is absolutely nothing covered on what is inside a RMDB, man."
1,Too much and not enough,"I also had this book as a text for a database design class in college. While reading it, I kept thinking to myself that I had learned more about practical database design from ""Dummies"" books. As a professional application developer, I would have to say that this book's only value is as a (seldom used) theoretical reference."
1,Terrible book,"This book seems to be emblematic of the problems many technical textbooks suffer. Whole chapters and series of chapters seem to be there just to take up space. Entire sections of redundant or extraneous information, or no information at all, can be found everywhere. The useful information in this 1400-page book could probably be expressed in 100 pages. It would be much easier to understand in that format as well, since extracting it from this morass is nigh-impossible. Useless drivel is expressed in tedious detail again and again, while actual useful information is in one or two obtuse sentences that are easy to miss or misunderstand."
1,"It's a very, very bad book.","I had to use this book for my database management class at Sac State. Only one word can describe this book: horrid. This is the first time I was afraid of failing a class and I beleive that this book had a lot to do with it. It was too difficult to follow and I found myself frustrated and sleepy at the same time. There is just too much information and the examples are not helpful at all. For our final project we had to create SQL statements to query the tables in our Oracle database and during the 12 hours I spent yesterday trying to finish not once was this text helpful. I tried to sell it back too, but apparently no one wants it. Just as well I guess since I might need it again next semester (assuming I don't pass that is). :("
5,Old but good,"From way back in the day. This is one that has stood the times, great country-rock of the 70's. Good songs, good playing, a great cd for the road or just to kick back and listen to on the back porch."
4,Hot licks,"Vince Gill really breaks through here. Not only with his sweet vocals, but with his Telecaster solos combined with Jeff Wilson's additional lead guitar work on the uptempo songs. A star is born."
4,Pagan Polys Need This Book,"Kaldera took the time to interview people in poly relationships (or have them fill out surveys) to pull together information from a wide cross-section of the poly community. He does a wonderful job of presenting concepts and differing viewpoints on the same ideas. He's not very good about sourcing statistical-sounding information, but overall the book will be valuable to anyone considering or involved in a poly relationship."
4,intense song-poems.,"these are the songs of storytellers. poems standing in as songs, woven in intense, heavily layered music, full of rhythmic drive. the band sports two lead singers: one female (carla torgerson), one male (chris eckman), and a whole host of instruments on this recording: guitars, lap steel, accordian, mandolin, vibes, piano, organ, bass, drums, violins, cello, and even viola. standout tunes for me are: the powerful rock song ""glad nation's death song,"" ""long time here,"" which is a haunting vocal by carla torgerson, ""findlay's motel,"" a great ballad, and perhaps my favorite ""murdering stone,"" which is a beautiful mid-tempo tune with eckman and torgerson harmonizing on an oddly poetic lyric. all in all, an outstanding piece of work."
4,Good Starter,"Defenitely a book to add to your library. Covers enough of basics of COM and good discussion on Monikers, type Libraries, Marshal interface pointers and Automation. I started with no knowledge of COM and did pretty well."
1,Better books Available,"The book lists all COM buzzwords on it back cover. Unfortunately not one is covered well. The book is - simply put - poorly written. The Roger Sessions book had the same problems but it at least was some fun reading. This surely is not for beginners (Recommend ""Inside COM"") and for deeper issues, I feel ""Essential COM""(principles) and ""Advanced DCOM Programming""(practice) beat it easily in exposition."
1,Not Like The Book or Appropriate For Children,"I purchased this to go along with the story so that my students could compare and contrast the book with the film. I am so glad that I previewed this in advance because it was horrible! There was even a section where Olive ends up in a bar and you could see the characters drinking. Overall it does not represent the book or the holiday values that a children's film should. Stick with Ruldoph, if you are looking for a classic holiday reindeer film."
5,Olive the Other Reindeer,This is a wonderful Christmas book. The title alone made me laugh because many/most people say that very thing when singing Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer. The story is quite appealing and my grandbaby enjoys it.
4,Christmas Spirit,"""Olive, the Other Reindeer"" is a cute, cheerful, fun story about a dog named Olive attempting to save the world from a presentless Christmas. There are a few funny parts, as well as parts that keep you interested. The movie is a good one to glance at every now and then while doing activities such as decorating the Christmas tree, preparing for Christmas, or celebrating Christmas itself. I saw this movie on television a year or two ago, and found it to be much better then I had thought it would be. Small children will especially love the big eyed little dog and her sneaky but caring penguin friend. I recommend it."
4,Add to your christmas classics...,"Very cute. Very clever. Very funny. Adults will enjoy it as much as the kids. Olive (Drew Barrymore) is a dog who believes she is a reindeer. She never felt comfortable in her own skin. When Christmas may be cancelled,Olive heads to the North Pole to help Santa and save Christmas. The ""Grinch"" in the plot is an embittered mail man (Dan Castalanetta of Simpson's fame) trying to stop Olive from getting to the North Pole. They meet lot's of characters along the way. Lot's of fun!"
4,Olive the Other Reindeer,"Excellent video, even though it embellished the book...Enjoyed it thoroughly with my grandchildren!"
4,Cute,This is one of my daughter's favorite Christmas movies. We bought it once. Bought it again when it was lost/stolen. Then bought it again as a gift! Loosely based on the book. Michael Stipe is one of the voices.
4,A Jewel,"This is a spectacular Christmas special that people of all ages will enjoy, and it isn't like any holiday special that you have ever seen before. I have loved this quirky little film for years, which delivers an unexpected, fun, and surprising storyline. It is not your typical cliched special, it is not a several-hour commercial promoting any kind of product, it is not sickeningly sweet, and it is not annoying, all while still remaining wholesome and ending happily for the characters. If you watch this film, it will be prized by your family for ages to come, and it certainly deserves a place among the most famous specials of all time, like Rudolph or Frosty. It cannot become a classic until it's been watched and enjoyed for ages, so give it a try!"
5,Best New Holiday Program in a very long time,"This is our favorite, along with How the Grinch Stole Christmas. We had the book and nearly went bananas when we saw it on tv.It is a lovely story and always touches my heart!Any Christmas video and/or book collection lacking this selection is in need of update!"
5,Olive the other Reindeer,Last year I bought each of our grandchildren the Elf on the Shelf book and the elf. I purchased a female elf for our granddaughter. They have enjoyed it immensly for the past two years so this year I purchased Olive the Other Reindeer and they thoroughly enjoyed the video and the book. This was followed by Olive my Love.
2,Seems like a rushed Christmas money making effort,This seemed like a cool idea. Matt Groening and an animated Christmas special with a clever pun name? But it was like any other hurried low-budget Saturday morning cartoon intended for undiscriminating 8-year-olds. It wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't original. There was nothing special about it at all.
2,Nothing like the book,"I purchased this for my six year because she has the book and loves to read it at Christmas time. The movie however, is nothing like the book. While it's not a horrible movie I found it to be disappointing."
5,Fun for kids and adults too!,"I originally saw this when it aired on TV, years before my daughter was even born, and loved it! It's a modern jewel among all the older Christmas stories like Year Without a Santa Claus and such.This year I decided to buy it for my 2.5 year old. She watched it over and over and over. Sometimes three times a day! It's as wonderful as I remember. It is great for the kids and adults too. It's a must have in the Christmas video library."
5,Great for kids AND adults!,"This is simply one of the best animated Christmas specials in the last several years, perhaps even the last two decades! Ranks right up there with Rudolph and The Grinch - an instant classic!Sweet, funny and hip all at once - never strikes a bad note! Drew Barrymore as Olive is perfect. I wasn't very open to seeing this as most recent Christmas specials have struck me as lacking, but this puppy charmed and amused me to the point where I HAD to buy the DVD! If you're a fan of classic animated Christmas fare, give this a go - you'll be glad you did!"
5,Olive The other Reindeer,"Wow. This little movie is ssssooo good! I'm 16 and the oldest of 5 and this is a perfect family movie, (i think i watch it more then the little kids though. lol.) it puts you in the perfect mood for the holidays and it is so cute - a little dog who saves christmas - it's great! Plus it is only like 45 minuits and it has the vioce of Drew Barrymore of Olive.I could go on and on (i have to my friends belive me!)but this little writing box is filling up. i know i'll go watch it again!"
1,Disappointing,Disappointing if you're expecting an animated version of of 'Olive' that's as charming as the books are.
2,"Sorry to rain on the parade, but...","I wasn't too pleased. I bought this video for my three-year-old because he loves the book--which is sweet and innocent (Olive ACTUALLY does think she must be a reindeer) AND sooo beautifully drawn, but the movie is filled with mean people and animals who are anti-christmas, shysters or simply selfish. The entire way through the movie Olive is working her way against miserable characters. I had a difficult time watching this and finally turned it off after Olive got to the North Pole--the reindeer beating up on Olive in the bar was just too much. This isn't funny for a three-year-old innocent, it's just mean. I would not recommend this video for young kids, unless your child watches, and is used to, meanness and selfishness."
1,Not for young children,"This movie was brought home by my daughter, a kindergartener, from her school's library. This is definitely NOT for children. There is nasty mailman, a panhandling thing named ""Martini"" and behaviors that are NOT what I want to be teaching my small children. Characters punch each other, write ""I hate Santa"" and all sorts of other things that are inappropriate for children. The allusions are definitely for adults, not children. There SHOULD be a rating of PG-13 on this."
5,The Music of Mike Laure,"I was walking on a beach one day in a little town in Mexico called Chapala when I heard the most exciting music I'd ever encountered. Following the hot latin rhythm, I found myself in a place called The Beer Garden. On the stage was a tall, handsome man who was definitely as exciting as his music. I became well-acquainted with the group over the next months and was not surprised to learn that they already had several platinum albums to their credit. Cumbias Picosas con Mike Laure proves the man has attained new and incredible heights since that delicious day so many years ago and so many miles away. I salute you, Mike - El Maestro de Musica! Siempre Suya, Rani."
3,"Not Bad, but could be better","I wish they had more high energy tunes on this album, its good, but not the best of yes in my opinion."
5,Interesting and yet a little scary,"I purchased this book several years ago read it a couple of times and wanted desperately to contact a loved one through mirror gazing. I had in mind what I would do in order to make my chamber then give it a try. For some reason I have never made the chamber as I would have liked it but the book is in my library and every time I pass it I think ""I need to reread the chapter that tells you how to make contact and give it a try. I'm not sure why I don't do it because I really want to - I suppose I am a little fearful of what might happen but I find it strange that only one of the reviews I just read admits to trying the technique with some success. I wonder why others haven't tried it or will not say if they did or not. Great book with a pioneer in the subject having authored the book. I love Dr. Moody's life long devotion to this work and have always wanted to visit his lab to meet him and have expert help in having an OOBE."
2,"Raymond, Either Fish or Cut Bait","I know Raymond Moody is revered as the First Great Popularizer of NDE studies, but the more I read of and by him, the more credit I want to give to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. At least she was serious.Reunions takes a potentially serious subject and spins it as more of a form of entertainment for some, and grief reduction for others. For Raymond Moody, I guess that's all it is.Scrying, that is, gazing into mirrors or a crystal ball, has been used for thousands of years to ""see"" into the future. With Reunions, Moody presents his technique for using scrying by mirrors to encounter deceased loved ones. He does a good job of describing the technique, even providing a do-it-yourself guide. But he leaves the reader hanging on, wondering if he thinks the technique is valid or not. Sort of takes the wind out of the sails of the narrative."
4,Helps to see death in a different light,I actually brought this book for a very dear friend who had lost her son in tragic circumstances. Her physchologist suggested that she reads this book. She has said that the book is very thought-provking and has helped her see her son's death differently and re-inforced that her life is important and that she must help herself get over her depression and guilt. This book is certainly helping her.
3,Wasn't Impressed,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Paranormal/psychic research has been a fascination of mine for 50 years. So, I'm not a novice at attempting new things. The technique for speaking to the departed in this book didn't work for me. And if oracles could ""see"" the departed in a bowl of water, why then all the preparation that Mr. Moody suggests?"
5,love,I know it is important to rating produce so that is why I love the produceI did not dislike a thing from this produce.I would recommended this produce to my family and friends
3,Reunions: Visionary Encounters With Departed Love Ones,A bit of a disappointment. I expected it to have stories of NDEs but this is more of a how to book. Just over my head
1,It is forbidden to communicate with the dead,"Obviously if you are not a christian or a jew my words will be ignored. God specifically said that we are not to communicate with the dead. Period!I was going to order this book and right before I did I came across the term ""mirror gazing"" and looked into it before I ordered the book. Boy I'm glad I did. This is complete trash. A person who is grief stricken is vulnerable and probably easier to deceive by the enemy. I would stay away from this stuff like it was the plague."
1,REUNIONS,"I FOUND THIS BOOK BY MOODY DISILLUSIONING. I HAD READ IT PREVIOUSLY ANDFOUND MIRROR GAZING TO BE FAR TOO CLOSE TO FORTUNE TELLING FOR MY TASTE.IN FACT IT DAMPENED MY ENTHUSIASM FOR FINDING TRUTH IN NDE'S AND ADC'S MORETHAN I CARE TO ADMIT, EVEN TO MYSELF.GEORGE W. FRANKLIN913-362-8398"
5,One of husband's favorite's,The Statler Brother's Gospel Favorites is one of my husband's favorite cd's. If you like good old songs gospel music this is the cd for you.
4,Gospel,"This Album has some songs that I have never heard before, but I like it. This group fits gospel to a tee."
1,Beware,They require 3rd party vaidation and then start charging you other fees.... used to be a good product.. now it stinks....
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"Versacheck sounds like a great idea but unless the checks are printed with special magnetic ink, they are hard to use. Stores and banks often will not accept them because their check readers cannot read them if magnetic ink is not used. Versacheck sells printers and magnetic ink. The printers are cheap but the ink is very expensive. Moreover, the ink cartridges have a short life and Versacheck will not replace them if they are defective. i had two new black cartridges and neither worked but Versacheck would not replace them.All in all it appears that you save money by printing your own checks rather than having Intuit or another printing company print them for you. But in the long run, it costs more to print your own checks than have your checks prepared by a 3d party."
1,Unconvincing Evidence.,"In this book the author states because the symptoms of marijuana addiction are ""often subtle and difficult to identify"" marijuana users should be diagnosed as dependent even when they do NOT meet the American Psychiatric Association's very vague criteria for drug dependence.By this rationale, if I drink one beer, I am an alcoholic.I would give this book No Stars if I could."
5,Work great!,"I purchased this item to mount my Razr to the air vent instead of the windshield of my car. It took a couple of minuets to figure out how to mount it to the vent, but once I got it on, it works great. The vent mount is designed for many unit, such as ipod video, pda,etc."
1,Very Unhappy,"I have two major problems with this product. 1) The set up of the practice questions is confusing. The sections of questions are not defined by topic and are numbered strangely. 2) I expected there would be a full practice test at the end to help the student judge whether or not they were fully prepared for the actual exam, but there is none."
5,wow,"My father and his friends were much more interested in this era than I was, but I picked up the book one day and was instantly absorbed in the personal stories and remarkable heroism. The book is written in a spare, almost impersonal manner - but you cannot be impersonal with these depictions."
1,Not what picture shows!,"I ordered this expecting what is displayed, but was sent a place mat that is all white with 6 outlined boxes on it with 1, 2, 3 and a, b, c in the middle of the boxes in yellow and red. I think it is ugly and not what I wanted. I email the seller and they got back to me right away apologizing saying there is a mistake in the ad and will refund my money, but I have yet to see a refund (this was a week ago) and I see they still have not changed the picture to show what you will actually get."
1,Two words: SELL OUTS!,"I would have given this a no star rating, but the lowest it went was one star. Their pictures need to go up on the dartboard, right next to No Doubt."
3,Lights Out,great album returns to the bosstones earlier days Dickies grissly voice shines on this album.
2,Not compatible with Guitar Hero 2!,Loved it until we bought the sequel. The fret buttons only work on the original game. Ouch!
2,Doesn't last,"If you are quite a big player, this guitar might not be your best choice. The wammy bar broke after only a few plays. I opened the guitar up and realized that only a very small spring was holding the mechanism. No wonder it broke so easily! Not a very reliable product."
2,Overly harsh punishment,"A sleazy showcase of sadism, slapstick and sentimentality, this version of The Punisher is only marginally better than forgettable Dolph Lundgren version. Good performances from Rebecca Romijin, Ben Foster and John Travolta, and a cameo by Roy Scheider, don't quite make up for the way the film turns slaughter into a joke by veering drunkenly from the subfusc to the ridiculous.Reviews I've read suggest that the directors' cut manages to explain away most of the plot holes, but I feel no urge at all to see it: I'm not sure what comics readers did to deserve this, but whatever it was, we've been punished enough already."
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTING! ONE OF THE WORST MARVEL MOVIES,"remember buying the Amazing Spider-man issue that first features the Punisher. I was never a die hard fan,but certainly thought he was cool. I wanted to like this movie and thought it would be one of the better Marvel Comic films.......I was wrong! This movie was really bad and my 2 star rating is generous! I don't even know where to begin with what went wrong. They did not capture the dark,gritty essence of the comic book! The movie was almost laughable! I have not seen the director's cut yet,but I really don't think they can fix this one with some added scenes. If your a fan your gonna buy it any way,but I don't think it's worth the 1/2 inch space it takes on my DVD shelf!"
3,The Punisher,"Better than the orginal, but not amazing.Thomas Jane is a great actor who translates a physical role very well, unlike meatheads like Dolph. The action is solid and the violence is thankfully not wimpy PG13 material!The real flaw is John Travolta, he has no charisma in this filmat all. In his previous bad guy roles Face Off, Swordfish or even Broken Arrow he was very flaymboyant and mad as hell.Here he is like a old mafia don, redudant and boring."
1,The Punisher Blu-ray,"If this is the best that the Blu-ray people can come up with, then there is something terribly wrong with the way that this title has been ""remastered"". It is hard to see the difference between standard definition and the supposedly high def version, and I would strongly suggest that you avoid this particular title. I was that disapointed that Amazon have refunded my purchase price. It is now going to be pot luck when titles are purchased as to whether you get your dollars worth. Compared to the Blu-ray version of ""Under Siege"" with Steven Segal which is superb, this one rates as about as low as you can go."
5,DVD,Fast service! Excellent! I received it before the date that I was told it would arrive. Very nice to work with!
4,Nice movie,"I like this original Punisher movie. Not the best acting I've seen, but overall the storyline was good. I definitely don't like the new one that's out, kinda lame."
3,ok la,This is not the best super hero comic book movie but it's has one of my favorite wrestler at all time in it. Big Sexy Kevin Nash Baby! That was the only reason why I bought it :)
2,The Punisher,"The Punisher was disappointing for me as far as the story line. He says it is not about vengeance, but the result is the same. Of all the Avenger characters I can see why this one did not make the team. The action scenes were good. I wanted to like the guy. The scene that gets him started on his quest was more than a little much."
4,A good action movie to watch with the guys...,"Although this movie is not a 'masterpiece' it is still fun to watch with some friends. There are some great one liners (very cheesy, actually so cheesy they make you laugh)...and theres plenty of action. For those of you who arent familar with the punisher...he is an FBI agent named Frank Castle whose entire family was murdered by the Saints' family. They thought they killed him but as always...they didnt, and suprise suprise...hes a little pissed. The movie kept me and my friends entertained and we all thought the ending was cool when all the pieces fall in place to the punisher's plan. This is just the first of the trilogy, the next one is hopefully going to be realeased in the fall of 2005. If you love the punisher or action movies...I would buy this...if your not sure...rent it and if you like it...buy it...I personally thought it was well done. Overall: B"
3,Not the Best Blu-ray Purchase,"An excellent film and one I should have just purchased on DVD. The video isn't terrible, it's just not up to par with some of the newer blu-ray releases."
2,Disappointment from Marvel,"This Marvel production has one of the most disappointing scenes and story line I've seen that were written by Marvel. Too many corny scenes that tend to make the story weak and unrealistic. How does a person who gets shot at least five times, gets blown up, and thrown in the ocean, still survive?"
5,Punishment!!,This is by far the best of the 3 Punisher movies by far. The third one was more like a very bad D movie. The first SUCKED!! I liked how this one showed a different way on how his family died and how he got sweet revenge on the people that did it without even lifting a finger...almost. I loved the ending on how the Punisher got his and how big bad Saint realized his wifey and BFF were telling him the truth. Dude got powned! I enjoy the added scenes. Too bad they didnt make the planned sequel with the same actor. Supposedly Mr. Saints remaining son was supposed to be Jigsaw. Dont know how that wouldve panned out since he was pinned down holding a time bomb. He woulda been jigsaw alright...pieces of him all over the ceiling. ha ha. Outstanding revenge movie with a stellar cast that has TALENT in acting unlike the other movies.
2,Formula,"Lots of special effects don't save this movie that follows a predictable story line that ends up being another edition of an old formula movie. It was exciting at times, but overall dull and boring. :-)"
3,Castle for the timid,"this movie was a big disappointment for me. it didn't have the extremes that i'm used to with the punisher. i actually prefer the punisher film starring Lundgren over this one because it had more action, but i wouldn't recommend it as a great film either. i like how the punisher's origin was done in the film starring Lundgren with flashbacks to show how he's tormented and how it drives him. the Lundgren version also has a comic book/campy feel to it that makes it more entertaining and enjoyable.luckily there's another punisher film coming out that looks like it'll be extremely violent and over the top."
5,Awesome,"I thought the plot was great, awesome fight scenes, some humor mixed in made for an incredible movie. Definitely followed up to what I would hope to expect for a Punisher movie. Bringing back the Rambo bow to the screen was nice to see as well. I definitely hope they make a sequel considering I think this is a much better Marvel movie than spiderman."
3,Keep consumers in the dark...,"This directors cut was recommended to me because of owning the previous release. My complaint is if the movie industry knows that there are going to release another release that is usually better than the previous I wish they would advise the consumer. I am tired of owning more than 1 copy of a title for ""17 additional minutes!"" If I enjoyed a movie at the theaters I usually buy it upon the release as it goes to DVD....at this point I might as well wait! Same goes for audio CD's as well. Oh well...I know I am not alone on this matter...but I guess I just either wait or double buy...or just say heck with it and save my money."
2,great movie awful blu-ray,"This is one of my favorite movie's however this blu-ray transfer is the worst I've seen yet and I own over 40 blu-ray disc's.First let me tell you I use a new Sony S3000 blu-ray player with a Sony XBR Bravia LCD and it is all properly calibrated so I do know what I see,having said that this picture quality is no better than the standard DVD release,maybe very very slightly more vibrant colors let me say again maybe slightly.After that there's the audio there is no PCM uncompressed or TrueHD audio,only 5.1EX its good but again the same audio as the standard dvd release.Now here's the kicker its not the extented cut which adds about 20 min. to the movie and its a worthwhile 20min. adding a new sub plot to the movie.I rarely say go for the standard dvd release or in this case the extended cut dvd,actually I've never said that but thats what I would suggest you do here,oh yeh its cheaper to."
3,Bring back Dolph!!,"The movie looks alright, except for one thing--They should have dug up Dolph Lundgren to reprise his role as the Punisher. Maybe he was too busy making Masters of the Universe 2...."
4,Awesome Movie and DVD Plays Well,This is not just an awesome movie but the DVD recording and playback of it is awesome as well.Thanks!! Phil
3,The Punisher,I really like the movie but I was very disappointed that it was a cut version of the original.
2,HD SOUND?,"I'm so sick and tired of buying blu ray movies that don't have HD sound. The picture is fantastic but the sound is still in a compressed format of either Dolby or DTS. Why should we pay more money for blu ray dvd's that are not in uncompressed sound. This is a scam by the movie industry like Paramount studios. Recycle older movies with blu ray picture quality but keep the same audio format as the original dvd format. More profit for the greedy movie studios! Note to Amazon Please list audio format in description(Dolby HD,DTS HD or PCM)"
4,I liked it,"I liked this mainly because it never aspired to be any thing but what it is - a comic book.It was dark and violent and sad but it had its humorous moments as well. My favorite scene was Franks fight with The Russian. Yikes it was half shut-your-eyes violent and half laugh-out-loud hilarious. This not not easy to achieve. Kudos to the director for a brilliantly executed scene.Overall the characters were terrific. Thomas Jane caught the essense of Frank Castle perfectly. John Travolta plays his patentented psycho bad guy role. Will Patton is always appreciated and it even had Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in an unusual but well thought out role. She's always a pleasure.The rest of the cast was likewise well executed -pun intended.All in all this movie won't be winning any Oscars nor will it feature in Cannes, but it is rip-roaring fun but not for the whole family."
1,Nothing to write home about.,The image has a soft grain throughout. This disc is put out by Lionsgate and they didn't put an uncompressed PCM sound track on it; so the sound is the same as the DVD. Both of the Lionsgate Blu-Ray discs I have (this and Terminator 2) have a stutter when the image pans like frames are being dropped! I've told Samsung (I have a BD-P1000) and they are looking into it. I have not seen the problem with any of my Sony discs. I see no point in buying this Blu-Ray disc; the DVD is probably just as good or better (I don't have the DVD).
2,Where's the 140 minute version of the Bluray?,I have the extended cut of The Punisher and I want to upgrade to the Bluray but not this one so until the extended cut is released I will not upgrade!
1,ya it's free for prime member,I am just glad I didn't pay to watch this movie. I wonder who directed or wrote the script. great job on killing one of my favorite Marvel character
2,shameless,"The entire family death scene is a shameless ripoff from Mad Max. The chase of the wife, the runover sequence, even the running to the death site clutching a double-barrelled shotgun (almost with the SAME CLOTHES) scene.Play the movie and close your eyes, listen to his voice. It's Mel Gibson.Shameless.But kind of good, nonetheless."
4,Punisher,"I haven't watched it yet, so I don't know the quaility of this product. It was in great packaging, although a few days later than the rest of the order. All in all, no complaints"
4,A very unapriciated movie!,"The Punisher is one of my favorite comic book characters!This movie was well filmed and a well told story!What I liked about this movie:1. Tom Jane nailed it as Frank Castle!2. John Travolta was an excellent billion dollar villain!3. The battle sequences were well done!4. The battle between Kevin Nash and Tom Jane was excellent!5. The story is very realistic (about grief, sorrow, revenge, and crime)!6. I like how they did everything practical in this movie!7. The plot held the movie up for the most part!What I didn't like was:1.The pace was too slow at times!2. They could have used more action sequences than they did!Overall: This is a well told story! I personally liked it a lot!My grade: B+ or four stars!"
5,One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time.,"I've seen this probably 10 times, it's one of my favorite movies. Stop comparing it to the comic and just enjoy it. Perfectly cast, well done."
3,Decent action film,"I found The Punisher to be a fairly entertaining action movie. If I can recall correctly John Travolta is only in it at the end of it. Maybe a little in the front as well, but mainly towards the back end of the film. There is a lot of action and suspense that keeps you watching it. I don't know that the script is very original since it seems too many movies are being made with the exact same story, hunting down people for revenge. Guess that type of topic is good for movie making since it can bring a lot of interest to the viewer.Peter J. Miller"
4,One of the Best Marvel Movies to date,"I really love this movie. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This film was everything a good movie ought to be... it's suspenseful, smart, and dark, but it still manages to be funny and uplifting. Even though Frank Castle has lost everything, he still manages to find hope and purpose where he can. I thought the acting was good too. Overall... lots of explosions and guns, plenty of bad words, some flesh, some tears, some laughs.... I doubt it'll be up for any Emmys, but it was definitely worth seeing, and you can bet your life that I'll be buying the DVD in September when it's released."
2,Those scenes were taken out of the original version for a reason...,"I liked the Thomas Jane version of the Punisher. That said, all the new scenes included in this ""Extended Cut"" version ruin the pace in what's already kind of a slow-paced film. A whole sub-plot on who snitched on Frank's real identity when he was undercover is introduced, and while it's not a bad sub-plot, it seems to bring the movie to a screeching halt several times. The new opening isn't all that hot either and the Garth Ennis comic that came with the first DVD was a better treat. I'd just go with the original DVD."
4,How Many Ways,"If you liked the comic book you will like this movie. Except for Travolta's overacting and Stamos'over dramatic scenes, this movie is quite good. Thomas Janes proves he can be an action hero. There is a Russian Assasin who reminds us we still can't trust Ruskies comunist or not. Also Ben Foster keeps it Real."
3,Fun but wait for DVD,"The Director stayed true to the comic book but missed several key points that left me worndering. As a result, the plot had some serious gaps in it but in the end, The Punisher gets out there and starts doing what he does best: Punishing criminals. There are some fight scenes that are hysterical as the Punisher simply wont die. If you like the WWE or if you liked early Arnold Schwartzenegger movies, you will have fun in this one."
4,Not At All As Bad As They Say,"I saw this movie on TV last week, and despite bad reviews by critics, I liked this bit of violent silliness nonetheless. This superhero-- or is he an anti-hero?-- is in many ways a lot like the original Batman when he first he first started out in 1938 and carried a gun. I liked this movie's black humor, especially the closing shot with all the burning cars. Amazing!A great movie, my only regret is that unlike many other movies, this DVD wasn't two-sided so we could get the choice of seeing the movie wide screen or fullscreen without the letter box bars taking up a third of the picture.Ron"
3,the punishment is that i bout this,"i seen the trailer for the punisher and i was interested to see what MARVEL had to offer. it starts of well and good but somehow in the middle it loses its way. i never read the comic but im sure it was better than this. although the end was good, john travolta's talent was deffently wasted in this film the same for thomas jane. the movie did not use many special effects and sadly that was a bad idea. the whole film felt like a tv movie, another bad idea. good enough but a waste of HOLLYWOODS money, make more movies like the butterfly effect and donnie darko"
2,Sanitized revenge,"contains spoilersThis film is dumb - Hollywood dumbA man sees his entire family (even extended family) blown away and then in a fit of revenge does what? Pretends to torture someone to get information out of him!!! That's right, he hangs a guy up and pretends he's going to hurt him, even to the point of searing a rump steak so the guy thinks it's his own burning flesh.He confronts two killers and as in a western high noon waits for them to draw their guns first!This is lame revenge."
1,Customers Punished By Missing Commentary Track,"This has got to be the first time in DVD history that a Commentary Track, which exists on the original $5 bargain bin version, is now ABSENT from the ""new, improved"" $15 Directors Cut! What the heck happened?Just because a few more minutes were added, doesn't mean that they couldn't have also added a few more comments.And nobody cares about any hastily cobbled Iraq garbage, either. Let's leave the Bush family's sick oil scam out of this. So thanks, but I'm sticking to the original version, WITH the all-important audio track, and without the Iraq oil junk.BTW, studios, I also don't want to see the events of 911 added to New York, New York - in case you were leaning in that stupid general direction!"
2,The Punishment Was Watching This Film,"I stood in the video store reading the description of The Punisher. I was not familiar with the comic series and didn't pay much attention to the movie when it was theaters.The back of the DVD poignantly explained that this one man with no special powers, none of the recources Batman had and only his intellect to stand-up for the weaker of our society. Sounded promising.Kudos to that writer, he or she managed to get me interested. The movie barely resembled that portrayal. The movie story line was so predictable I was hardly able to stay awake. I could have used that hour and a half doing something better. I'll take a pass on this one folks."
1,One comic book movie too many,"The story is weak and the charcters weaker.The action is mediocore. If you want good comic book movies get Blade or Spider-Man. Save your cash and if you get this for a present put it in the trash with ""Hulk""."
4,Marvel Movie,"Another Marvel movie. Not as popular (or as good) as some of the others, but still very enjoyable to watch. It is not very deep and thoughful, but then again, it is not meant to be. It is the classic blow stuff up movie that all guys like. So get it, enjoy it, and then store it for another day when you wanna see things go BOOM"
1,The real story was much better...,"All of this movie rewriting wasn't necessary. The details of the comic book Punisher were more than sufficient. Okay, I can put my love of the comic aside and view this as a separate entity--Aside from bastardizing the great story, the action and acting were lackluster overall, and in some spots, just plain bad. I won't even bother with the details.Maybe what the Punisher needs is an indie remake by some real fans, this high budget shine and corny dialogue isn't working!"
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"First, let me say that I've always been a huge fan of Marvel Comics in general and The Punisher in particular. Now, on to the bad news. This movie was one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever seen. There was absolutely nothing good about this film. The acting; terrible. The writing; terrible. The special effects; I've seen far, far better lately. Even the soundtrack music was lame and boring. If you're 14 years old and you've only seen a dozen or so movies in your life, you might actually enjoy this. Otherwise, you'll be wishing you had your $4 Blockbuster rental money back, just like I am. If I had paid to see this in a theater as I originally planned, I would be kicking myself right now. I watched this movie by myself and actually felt embarrased several times; for the actors, who for some reason decided to be a part of this joke, and for myself since I was the one wasting two hours watching it."
3,Typical.,"Overall this film was good, though fairly predictable. I did have certain expectations being a comic collector in my youth, some were met, some not. The faults: again predictable, though Frank Castle says he's not in it for just the revenge, it's basically a revenge tale. Tom Jane did a decent job, but the casting wasn't really perfect. Travolta as always added nothing, and a hundred other guys would have made a better villain. Laura Harring, who was Travolta's wife, is smoking hot, and needed better scenes. The death of her and Travolta's best friend were lame. Also, this getting an R rating, and being The Punisher, It seemed rather tame, and I expected more violence, etc. However, it was still a good movie, and made for a good 2 hours of escapism."
4,Non-stop!!!,"I expected this movie to be good from the previews and it was good. Not Excellent but a good film. This was very violent and could be disturbing to those with a weak-stomach, but boy was this a great film."
3,The Punisher (Movie),It wasn't too bad but I wouldn't spend my money on it after seeing it. Just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.
2,Disapointing if not entirley unexpected,"This film is not bad. When comic books are adapted to the movies this will always be a case of hit and miss. Thomas Jane is not one of those misses, he gives an edgy, linear performance, but has not conveyed the tragedy of the Punisher. The woeful screenplay does not help his cause much.I question why this film is not set in New York, most probably to avoid comparison to Spider-Man and Daredevil. This avoidance only highlights the weakness in the story. The lack of any credible antagonist e.g. the Kingpin weakens the film even more.It must be remembered that the two writers, Jonathan Hensleigh and Michael France, were responsible for writing screen plays for ""The Saint"", and ""The Hulk"" respectively. This bodes no good omen.If you want to see a good adaption of a vigilante from Marvel Comics, watch ""Daredevil"". If your desire is that of gunplay of the exceptional quality watch John Woo's ""The Killer"". I very much doubt the makers of this film did either."
1,"Sorry, but","Hard to get into a film where the star is shot point blank through the heart and dumped off a pier...then ""recovers"" without explanation.I know some films have a plot hole here and there...but let's get real!"
1,The Punisher,"If you haven,t seen this film, please don't waste your time or money. The version of The Punisher from 1989 was a lot better."
2,"I apologize, I know many will not agree, but this movie was not good.","This movie was not good, a little better than the Dolph Lundren version. Not enough action and killing like the comic book character. The actor's hairline was all wrong, the punisher didn't have a hairline that high c'mon. I would have given this movie 3 stars if it wasn't for that hitman. The hitman who played the guitar was the best thing about this film and it makes me so sad that they wasted such a great character on a film like this. This Guitar playing hitman should have been used in Natural Born Killers, chasing Micky and Mallory or in From Dusk Til Dawn chasing George Clooney and his crazy Brother Q. Tarantino. He did not belong in this film. What a waste of a great character. I would love to see the producers of The Punisher make another movie about the Guitar Playing Hitman. I would pay real money to see that. Some may dissagree so in fairness it is worth renting, but not owning. But see for yourself."
1,The Punisher is soft....get the 1989 version instead,"This movie made me feel as if I were watching a PG-13 kids movie. There wasn't enough action to keep me interested.After having his entire family murdered, he recoperates himself and then creates an elaborate plan to slowly turn his enemies against each other. Why doesn't he just blow them all away in one clean swoop ? That would have been quicker.I wonder if the people who gave this movie a good rating, ever saw the 1989 version."
3,The Punisher DVD. 2004 movie,"The Punisher is a good movie, not great but good. Although I am not sure why Frank Castle is an FBI Agent or why it's based/filmed in Tampa? and Travolta? The Movie could have been alot better and true to the Comic Book and Frank Castle. Yet Hollywood messes up a Good thing as Always, It's worth Watching and alot better than the 90's Punisher Film."
2,I've seen better,"I was somewhat entertained watching this movie, John Travolta made it more interesting that it would have without him. However, it did not really impress me very much. It's the kind of movie to see only once, it's definetely not a collector's item."
3,NOT the EXTENDED CUT,"This is not a review of the Movie itself so may others have already done so.Rather It is to make others aware that this is NOT the EXTENDED CUT previously released on DVD. This is the basic version shown in theaters. The EXTENDED CUT has a running time of 140 mins, where this version is only 123 mins. Every other Marvel Blu I have purchases has been the EXTENDED, or DIRECTOR, or UNRATED CUTS. I was Disappointed that I did not check this info out before placing my order. It was my assumption this Blu would be on par with the rest of them.I hope this help others who might also prefer the EXTENDED CUTS of the films. Learn from my mistake =)"
1,Go with the standard DVD.,"I was really disappointed with this sucker. I traded in my Extended Cut version to apply a store credit toward this version. What a mistake! Not only is the quality of this blu-ray transfer no different than the standard version, but's more grainy with tons of digital noise. The menu system is underdeveloped (this was one of the first blu-ray releases) and confusing. There are no special features. I didn't notice one single hi-def image in the entire movie, and most of the background was soft, muddy and unclear. I almost thought this was defective until I read a few other reviews. Stay away from this one. Shame on Lions Gate for even calling this a blu-ray transfer."
2,More Like a Time Out,"The Punisher comes very close to being camp with silly humor following ridiculous violence. There are moments of actual tension but they are rare and overwhelmed by unconvincing acting, made for TV direction, a laughable score and a bizarre desire to work in references to westerns. In the last few minutes the movie seems to try to overcompensate for all the past silliness but it just collapses under the weight of cliches.If you have a thing for movies that include wacky housemates or you just want to see Thomas Jane standing around in dramatic poses this movie is for you. If you want to see a movie about a man devastated by grief and fueled by murderous rage try Punisher: War Zone."
3,"Great movie, but not blu-ray quality picture","No complaints about the movie, Punisher is a great movie. I purchased the Blu-ray hoping that it would look amazing, but it did not. In my opinion, it is not even equal to the dvd version upconverted, so if you are looking to buy this for the simple reason it is Blu-Ray, price shop and see if dvd costs less. You will likely be getting a better product.I viewed the Blu-ray on a 52 inch Samsung/1080/120hz, Samsung Blu-ray, and Monster 800 HDMI cable."
3,Great Movie But For An Early Blu-Ray Not Great,I also have this movie both standard and now the blu-ray version I'm sure most people know about the storyline of this movie if not read the Amazon info about it an that is the jist of what the movie is about. I just want to say to people that if you already have the standard dvd version thats all you're going to need. The video and sound quality are not much better than what you got with the standard dvd since this is one of the earlier blu-rays to come out and they haven't fully mastered the video and audio yet you won't see any clearer or sharper details or better sound quality with this blu-ray version. So again if you have the standard dvd Punisher just keep that one and wait until they come out with a remastered blu-ray version or just pass this one up..
3,Quite good and tough,"This is a simple piece of entertainment, that with the exception of a few key scenes you would never guess has anything to with Marvel Comics, unless you have read them. The plot as outlined many times before is that special forces guy Frank Castle kills a gangsters son in his last mission and the Gangster (John Travolta) attempts to kill all of Castles family as well as him in revenge. Castle survives and seeks his own revenge.Its reasonable well done, and certainly entertaining. I was particularly fond of Castles relationship with his oddball neighbours and the loyalty that they both show to each other in the end. However in my view it was let down by a slightly wooden performance from Thomas Jane in the leading role. I never really believed in him... I could imagine this role being done very well by Hugh Jackman. Naturally John Travolta is good in his role.Look out for Kevin Nash, an ex professional wrestler as ""The Russian"" who is almost a foot taller then The Punisher!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Unfairly maligned by critics, The Punisher offers a appealingly retro vigilante movie that slides nicely up against the Mad Max movies, (which it strongly resembles) albeit without the flair of Miller's trilogy."
3,regular dvd version,"while the movie itself is awsome, i ordered it to get the mini comic book as well, but there wasn't any. even after amazon had happiely sent me a replacement product there still was no mini-comic book"
4,Don't dare to deal with the patience of a simple man!,"The punisher is by far one of the most potent, powerful and hard to die thrillers in years.Because far beyond of its well known plot about a personal revenge, the movie is really a visual tour de force, and represented for Travolta one of his major achievements.Absolutely a must-see"
3,Good but not great,"The punisher was.. not bad. Certainly NOT the greatest movie of the century, but nonetheless fairly entertaining. The action is not overdone, and for the most part, fairly believable. Where it fails however, is in originality. Having never read the original comic book, I can't compare the movie to it. However, after watching it, I couldn't help but feel that it was nothing I hadn't seen before. By that I mean that there was nothing in it that made it feel any different from any other I-lost-someone-close-to-me-so-I-will-take-revenge type of movie. In short, there was nothing in this movie that I hadn't seen elsewhere.It was a well executed movie, but not really worth buying unless you happen to be a fan of the comic or enjoy revenge movies. If none of the above, consider renting it."
4,i liked it,"i liked the punisher! the action was crazy, and frank castle is an evil man! (i couldnt believe it when he put that C4 on the string and gave it to travolta's son. that was brutal!) my only complaint has to be that there is too much plot building, and not enough actual punishment. plus, it was so corny when at the end, the car bombs made the shape of a skull. oh well, the good outweighed the bad (the russian! scary!!), and i liiked the movie. even though it could have been better."
4,The Punishisher is Fun!,"The Punisher is a fun movie, it really is. The movie is 2 hours and 4 minutes long, but it doesn't drag on and on. For a lesser known film company, Artisan, the cast does a pretty good job. Thomas Jane is excellent as the not so cheery Punisher. But, my favorite characters of the film had to be his three fellow apartment tennets. They provide of a lot support for this one man that they rarely know. All three actors are superb.The story itself is okay. The beginning is heart-wrenching and the second half of the movie drifts into an Othello-like complication. The climactic confortation can definitely be better, but the movie is still fun anyway. I liked it, but I could understand if others didn't. If you have doubts of the movie, check out a matinee."
5,The Punisher Rocks,"I saw this movie on opening night and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!This movie in my opinion is the best Marvel Comics adaptation outside of Spiderman (off course). The action was excellent (the ending was spectacular) and the acting wasn't bad either. Sure there were a few corn lines thrown in. Thomas Jane was awesome as Frank Castle, and displayed a wide variaty of emotions. John Travlolta wasn't too bad either (boy he does love playing villians). In closing: if you love action movies and are looking for a good time go see this movie."
4,punishment,i CANNOT wait until the new punisher movie comes out. Thomas Jane is no Dolph Lundgren but we can't always have what we want. The punisher is the coolest superhero in the world besides Batman and this movie will do the dying comic book hero movie genre justice by reviving it's lifeless existence.Would have gotten five stars if Dolph was Frank Castle one more time.
2,Horrendous,"I came in watching this film with good expectations and 2hours worth of decent action. This film was terribly dreadful. The cast is poor, the script is poor, and the story is so inevitable from start to end. This film is degrading for John Travolta (a respected) actor. This film is certainly the worst he has been in (maybe he wanted some extra cash). The Punisher himself is unconvincing, and the only thing believable about him is his muscles. This film was a waste of money, and most defintly does not match upto any of the other marvel charecters such as spiderman, or superman. This film was overall a dissapointment, which has even led me to want to write this review about it.... What a waste of time. TERRIBLE.Rating out of 10*...3*"
2,New Face...plus the emblem.,"They are changing many things in the transitions from comics to movies. Stick(Daredevil's mentor)did not appear in the movie, his name wasn't even mentioned.Spider-man has natural webbing now, wich is cool. The Kingpin is not white(who cares?.Marvel wasnt big on movies in the early nineties(anyone remember the captain america movie?)I thought the first punisher movie in 89 was ok, this guy was tougher than bat-man, now i realize the punisher is just a guy with guns, that's it.Marvel has better superheroes, but i'm curious to see this new punisher in action. Funny, the guy looks like a younger Christopher Lambert(Notice it?)If there is a punisher soundtrack, i expect it to be HEAVY.Other soundtracks such as Spider-man,Daredevil and Hulk left something to be desired...oh well..one can hope."
2,Not helpful,"The only reason this book gets two stars instead of one is because it was promoted honestly as a source of inspiration and did not promise detailed instructions. The publisher should have known better, however, than to purposely omit weaving details. Such a format is of little use to those of us who have no desire to spend time experimenting. Further, there are inaccuracies; I resorted to telephoning one of the contributors when I was unable to reconcile the draft with the scarf -- because the draft as presented in the book was incomplete! I wasted an afternoon because of this error."
4,Not a pattern book,"As many have written already, this is definitely a book for inspiration and not a formula or pattern ""how to"" book. Since I had the chance to look through it before buying, I knew what I was getting into and have really enjoyed it. Some of the weaves are wonderful puzzles to try to figure out and mimic, some are just beautiful and astonishing (like those woven with sewing thread!). As a professional weaver, I have to respect the designers for retaining their designs, but a few more details to get me on the road would have been great!"
5,Don't you talk about Mem!,"You can talk bad about the way i review CD's, talk about how bad my english is.you can talk about my old beat up car. talk about my old raggedy clothes.you can talk bad about my house or my dog, ill just shake your hand and wish you well.you can talk about the way i walk, they way i talk, you can talk about how bad i smell.call me names when i leave the room, it dont matter to me about none of that, you can call me a big baldheaded sap sucking booger bat.you can call me a big fat ugly bum, But don't you dare talk about Mem's album!!!!"
3,Not a biography.,"I like it seems many other here bought this book thinking it was a biography of Thomas Paine. I enjoy reading biographies of the fathers and others of the American revolution and when a certain book is highly biased it tends to not be as enjoyable with the authors opinions spliced in here and there.Although I do not consider myself near a conservative I found the constant ""capitalism is bad and those who practice it are evil"" statements rather annoying and unnecessary. The book does give some in depth study to the life of Paine along with some objectivity of his works.All and all not a good biography but if you enjoy people trying to hijack the names of the founders either from the left or right for their own political opinion this book probably is good for you."
3,Objective,"I guess I prefer first, something that gives me a little more about what makes the object of a given biography tick (for instance, why did he quote scripture liberally in ""Common Sense"" but later write ""The Age of Reason"". What changed?). Secondly, I would prefer a little more objective viewpoint. This guy is obviously in love with Thomas Paine. Yes, Mr. Paine was apparently instrumental in sparking the Revolution, but I cannot help but wonder how accurate the author's viewpoints are when he is so carried away by Paine. In spite of the fact that Mr. Kaye offers some interesting thoughts on Paine, his love affair spoils the book for me."
5,Great read about the true father of the American Revolution,I heard Harvey Kaye on Bill Moyers Journal and decided to read the book on my summer vacation. A true eye opener about the true father of the American revolution and how the polictics of personal destruction pre-date the 24x7 cable news cycle.A great read about a great and doubt difficulat man.
3,On Paine,"This book is worth reading even for those of us who admire Edmund Burke more than Thomas Paine. After a pretty standard biography of the great figure from the Revolutionary War, Professor Kaye shifts to writing, from the commanding heights of the liberal university, on Paine's perceived impact on the various strains of America's social progress movements from the early 1800s to the present. The author closes by clearly yearning for a world anew, where a united, modern, and patriotic Democratic Party will do spirited battle with greedy corporations and powerful Trilateralists on behalf of the needs of the common person."
1,Don't take a look at this now,"As a huge Bill Collins fan (I loved him even when he was in Genesis) I was gutted that this CD does not have any of his greatest hits on it. How could the publishers miss off ""Sussudio"", or ""You Can't Hurry Love""?What about ""One More Night""? Or ""Groovy Kind of Love""?And, quite frankly, not including ""Against All Odds (Take a look at me now)"" is unforgivable.This CD is not worth the money. Avoid it."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this product to upgrade my DELL Dimension 4700 computer. It didn't fit! Product should have included information as to which computers it would fit into, with out additional components being required first!"
3,Not Perfect Copy,"I bought this thinking I would not need to re-load a bunch of software and it did save me from loading or reloading much of it. After I did a clone copy, I did have to re-load Outlook for my email and I did have to re-load my Roxio Movie Creater software. XP seems to be working fine. Not much help from the 800 number. This drive is fast and you get 93% of the advertized storage space. The other 7% goes to the indexes."
2,Fuzzy dvd quality!,"This is a captivating story to support teaching the Holocaust; however, the film quality is terrible. The fuzziness of the dvd makes it hard to watch. Too bad."
2,Poor Video Quality,"I am a high school English teacher and was excited to see that there was a ""made for television"" movie that closely follows the plot of the book. I was shocked at the poor video quality; while the story is very good, and the acting is ""totally 80's"", the video quality is very, very low. Additionally, the video quality degrades even more as it is played on a SmartBoard device. While there is little to no alternative to this product, and I don't think it is the seller's fault, I had hoped for a better product."
2,The Wave,"Although I received this dvd quickly, the product was kind of blurry, kind of like watching a movie through a foggy lense. If there is a way of cleaning this movie up, I would recommend it. Unfortunately, watching this movie through a haze took away from enjoying it."
1,The Wave,"This is my second try with this particular title (""The Wave"") by Alexander Grasshoff. This one, like the first one I purchased, will not work. I tried several DVDs all with the same result---intro music and no response to PLAY commands. Perhaps you need to reconsider products by BN Publishing---they won't play."
2,really too bad,"Quality is very bad, can see it only on computer, scaled down. Great film, but I'm disappointed.Toller Film, die Geschichte finde ich persönlich besser umgesetzt, als in der aktuellen Kinofassung (das Ende ist anders!) - leider in deutsch nicht mehr zu erhalten. Aber die Qualität dieser DVD ist dermaßen schlecht, dass man es nur in Miniaturauflösung ertragen kann. Bin enttäuscht."
3,Good but not as good as the new UK version,"I really liked the book. It reminds you that you always have to be very critical towards any leader. Only a democracy in which people are willing to stand up against any misuse can last.Anyway, the movie disappointed me a little. I think it fails to show all the drama that was going on in the class room back then. However, there is a new release from the UK which I liked much more. It has great actors and was made with a very high budget."
2,The Wave on CD,"I purchased this CD to accompany the book for my English class. I was very disappointed to see that it was nothing more than a recorded version from a made for TV movie (including dead air spaces where advertisements would be inserted). One would think that in today's world with modern technology, a cleaner version would have been available. Shame on Amazon for charging $22.49 for it! As for the content, the video followed the book very closely. A few details were added to the CD while some minor ones from the book were omitted."
2,The wave,I returned the first copy that I recieved. The quality of the film was not very good. I did recieve a new copy quickly and with no hassles. The quality is still not great (it is grainy) but I am sure my students will still enjoy the movie.
3,The Wave,Would have like to see a little more than just an obvious copy. Was hoping for a slightly more professional product. It would have been nice for the menu to include scene selection. Audio quality wasn't the best; too quiet in some spots and blasting in others.
1,Get the book,"Really, anyone interested in the subject should just get the novel by Todd Strasser because this movie was poorly done. The acting was bad and quite a lot important information was skipped."
5,excellent teaching tool,I am a history teacher and found this film to be an excellent tool to teach gang involvement.
2,"Good, but a little too abstract!",This was a good book but it was a little too deep for me. If you like deep books this is the one for you! It's also a little confusing. The piolt's drawing is very odd.
3,"Kinda weird, but has a special message","This book was kind of strange, and I didn't really understand it at first. Later in the book, though, I realized that it was about grownups, and how they are always so busy with life, and they never really sit back and enjoy it, and see it from a child's perspective. Figuring out the message was more fun than reading the book, though."
3,I don't see what the big deal is about this book.,"Read the book last night after reading the reviews here. You might come away with the reinforcement of one or two basic ideas that most people know already and ponder once in a while, althought the reading of the book itself is not enjoyable enough worth getting to the end."
3,Fairy tale or Complex?,"One thing i liked about this book was that it was short. But the problem was, was this a fairytale or was it a thick complex book that was summerized into pictures and quotes?i was amazed by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry because around that time there was a war going on, i beilive it was world war 1 but how could he want to right a book during a time or violance and distractions from almost every part of the world.Overall i think this was a simple book with a strong mess to life. i still dont understand the messege and i hope to read the book again in a few years."
1,Am I the only person who found this book inane?,"My husband bought this ""classic"" to include in our home library for our grandsons. Surprisingly, neither of us had ever read it. I picked it up, hoping to be charmed. After 48 pages, I was shaking my head. Yes, the king was amusing with his political theory of contributory rule, but not for a child. The story of a geographer who never went anywhere would also not mean much to a ten year old. I continued reading with my young grandsons in mind and know without a doubt that they would describe this book as ""dumb"" or ""boring.""I am mystified by all the rapturous praise I have read here on Amazon about this book (translation irritations notwithstanding). I am troubled by this kind of breathless panting over books that the illuminati have declared ""wonderful"" (Frantzen's CORRECTIONS comes painfully to mind) and the rest of us stand back and swallow our words ""but the Emperor has no...."""
4,Intelligent Classic,Little Prince is a classic well worth reading! A mature book that can be enjoyed by any age. Understanding and caring of others.
2,THANK GOD I OWN THE PREVIOUS ANNIVERSARY HARDBACKS!,"Accidentally bought both a small paperback as a gift and a lovely ""pop up"" art edition of The Little Prince this Christmas and took notice from Mr. Howard's self aggrandizing and patronizing opening salvo - a pedantic ""translator's note"" - his ""excuse"" of an explanation regarding the dedication to Leon Worth, it is instantly obvious one has had a prude's stick forced upon one... making this treasured classic of poetic nuance an unrecognizable, stiff and ornery translation.I am so lucky and fortunate to own both the Fiftieth and Sixtieth Editions of the Hardback Katherine Woods versions. While it is amusing to see the lovely paper work in the pop up book, it is not worth the ""excuse"" of reading it. Get your hands on the Katherine Woods version every time. Especially when reading this to children. Why ruin something perfect already?"
2,We did NOT need a new translation.....,"The pop-ups are wonderful but I sincerely dislike the new translation. If you fell in love with The Little Prince as translated by Katherine Woods, think twice about buying this. It is, after all, the story that we truly love."
4,Great pop-up book,"If you love ""The Little Prince,"" you'll love this creative pop-up version. However, I am not happy with the translation - earlier English translations are much better."
3,"I can see why this is a classic, but the author's other books are better.","This is a great quick introduction to Saint-Exupery's writing. I think this book is great to give to a 14-18 year old and to discuss over dinner as an introduction to adult life and higher thought.But if you really want to some amazing writing, check out my review of Airman's Odyssey."
3,The Little Prince (English paperback translation),"I had downloaded the original French edition (kindle version) and I had given it a 5 star rating. I bought the book so that I could read the story to my granddaughter but I gave it a much a lower rating, primarily because of the poor printing quality of the book."
2,disappointed.,"i have read this book a number of times, its a brilliant story. however, this is a terrible translation from the french. it is definately lacking in eloquence and poetic flow. if you are looking to buy this book in english,i would go with katherine woods translation.i bought this copy for a gift, and i am -so- disappointed that i am going to buy the older translation on ebay."
3,Old Version is Better,"I bought The Little Prince, which I have loved for 40 years, for a special present. Glancing through it I became more and more dismayed. Where is the wonderful description of the flower, ""unique in all the world?"" Where is the graceful and touching goodbye of the fox to the prince? This ""stunning new translation"" is a great disappointment. I am buying several copies of the older version while they are available since it is now out of print. New readers will not know the felicity of language that we older readers have appreciated."
1,WARNING WARNING!!,"I almost bought the new translation for a friend who had never read the little prince!! Fortunately I read through it first. OUCH! It reads NOTHING like the original; the beauty and simplicity of the reading has been replaced by something that seems written for a first grade reader. (Maybe its more readable for first graders, but not for those who care about words...).I actually went home and read my original to make sure I wasn't imagining the difference (maybe it wasn't as good as I remembered!)Caveat Emptor!!BFM"
5,Inspiring,"This is an inspiring book. Thousands of imaginable possible metaphors there make it as beautiful as misterious. As any uncommon book that allows you to reconcile with yourself, it deserves to be read."
5,Incomparable Parable,one of the top 10 or so books you must read in your lifetime. but don't expect to find a dry eye in the house when you're done. as sad as it is beautiful.
5,The inside love,"A little prince shows how we can do the small things seems better.If each of us cares about the next, we can live a pleasure life. The famous sentence ""Only see with the eyes, the essential is invisible to eyes"" is the most important phrase inside this book."
4,Great,"I haven't read the whole book yet but so far I've enjoyed reading it. My mommy told me about this story and, so I stated reading it although I haven't finished reading it I like it. I recommened this book strongly to others. By the way if anyone likes Morrissey in one of his music videos he is holding this book. So I think he'd recommened this book to."
5,Wonderful Book - Although it may start slow,"I read this about 2 years ago, before this book was popularised by the press. It's wonderful. Makes me realised how much I have become an ""adult"" and not being able to see things like a child. Don't get me wrong - I am not saying we shouldn't grow up. The truth is, we sometimes complicate matters unnecessarily just because it seems to be the ""grown-up"" way of doing things. If only we can combine the practicality of grown-ups and the clarity of children. This is a must-read."
2,Could not really get into it,"My teacher told us that this book was really about death. But for all the inuendoes hidden in a book disguised as a simple children's book, it just didn't interest me. I just found it bland and odd. It is a very short book, but even my patience was wearing thin in class. We had to read a chapter, then the teacher would discuss it in depth and its hidden messages. I just didn't care. I know many people love this book for whatever reason, but it just didn't do anything for me and I easily forgot about it after finishing it."
5,Just an answer for some reviews,"I would like to join everyone who mentioned this book as their favorite, and I may answer some question. Those who asked a question like ""When he entered Earth, how come he didn't burn in the atmosphere?"" probably never heard the word ""literature"". I really feel sorry for them. Novels of this genre are rarely based on the laws of phisics and other nature sciences. ""How could Dante meet Vergilius, who actually died ages before Dante was born?"": the same stupid question never asked. We are talking about literature and philosophy. If it's too hard to understand to someone, he misses a lot of great work of world literature. Sorry about the bad English."
2,Covers are horribly pixelated,"I know this is small, but it's something that really bothered me and might bother others. While the content is all fine in the paperback edition, the cover pages are terrible. The art is completely pixelated and it looks absolutely terrible. Actually, even the art inside looks simply like it was copied and pasted into a Word document, and they are somewhat pixelated and have a strange almost gray background."
2,Love The Content Of The Book But Condition was poor from Amazon,I bought the Pop-up book from Amazon at a really good price ($14.00) but was not told before hand that might have been due to damage to the book. Very Happy about the books content and price but my review and disappoint is for the condition which had a slightly crushed cover and a ripped pop-up design within book. Be careful when paying lesser prices with amazon.
5,Great buy and at a good price!,This book was delievered to me in a speedy fashion and in a great condition. You can't beat the price also.
2,Great book -- bad product,"I ordered this book as a keepsake, because it's my favorite book ever written. Unfortunately, this is a ""large-print"" version. That should have been in the title of the ad, because I missed it if it was in there anywhere. Actually, this version doesn't even contain large print. It's normal size text with lots of extra spacing between paragraphs. All drawings are so enlarged, they are highly pixelated. And there are numerous text errors throughout the copy. Great book -- bad product."
2,Read J.V.'s review,"The review by J.V. is a must-read if you're considering buying this translation. Save yourself the trouble of Howard's translation, and head to a used bookstore. I have read ""The Little Prince"" in its original French, and while Katherine Woods' translation is at times too literal, Howard's version is absolutely appalling. I once bought it for a friend without having read it, and seriously considered returning it because it was just that bad.""The Little Prince"" is my favorite book, but is not worth the money in this ""improved"" translation."
2,FIVE STAR BOOK NOW ONLY AVAILABLE IN MEDIOCRE TRANSLATION,"This new Richard Howard translation is a travesty when compared with the translation by Katherine Woods that publisher Harcourt, Inc. has replaced. Howard has reduced the text to its lowest common denominator which the publisher calls ""streamlined"" and ""new and improved"". I call it impoverished and completely devoid of charm. I can't imagine what the publishers were thinking when they chose to replace the classic translation which beguiled us all during its 57 years in print and am reminded of Coca Cola's ""New Coke"" fiasco...an error which was quickly remedied. The ONLY positive comment I can make is that the color illustrations in the paperback edition are an improvement on the black & white illustrations of its paperback predecessor.The only good news is that you can still obtain used copies of the Woods translation at Amazon or your local used book shop. Look for the white cover and a publication date prior to the year 2000."
2,Don't buy the new translation until...,"Don't buy the new translation of this classic until you have read David Kipen's review in the June 21st San Francisco Chronicle (available at the paper's website). Kipen goes into detail about the specific word choices that render the new edition charmless. If you want to enjoy this book and, more importantly, to turn on a new reader, stick with the Woods translation."
5,The Woods Translation is Better,"If I had to choose only one favorite book, it would be The Little Prince. I have read it over and over again across the years. The book touches my soul like no other. I do not recommend the new translation by Richard Howard. It does not have the same charm and impact as the original Katherine Woods translation. One of the changes I do not like is that he uses contractions (e.g., ""We'd"" instead of ""We would""). For new readers, please read Woods' edition first. On C-SPAN's Booknotes, Howard admitted that the book is not ""beloved"" to him and showed no passion whatsoever for the book. Oddly, he referred to one of the profound rose passages as one of the book's ""creepy"" passages! (?)"
1,Matters of Consequence rewritten,"If you would like to experience the Little Prince as the brilliant book it is, DO NOT READ THIS TRANSLATION! The translator obviously missed the key points that make this book the treasure it is. The ""Matters of Consequence"" phrase is changed throughout the story, completely destroying one of the main themes. Also, more complicated words have been replaced with simple words. Instead of elephants being very cumbersome they now take up a lot of space. Ack! Again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TRANSLATION! It is for silly grown ups who have forgotten what it is to be a child. Big words are okay, they help children learn. If we continue to over-simplify things, not only will we be robbing our children of a stronger education, we will have created a new form of literature that is boring for all. Long live the old version!!!"
4,Like it,I bought it as a gift for a Pay it Forward initiative. The gift recipients liked the book and hence the initiative was successful.
5,A classic,I got this product for my nephew's 6th birthday. He loves this book. I read it when I was a kid and still remember it. It is classic and all kids should read it.
5,He appears out of nowhere; life will never again be the same,"While St. Exupery's book The Little Prince may seem to be achildren's book, adults can learn a great deal from it about""matters of consequence"" and the essential things in life...Through the voice of the narrator who is stranded in theSahara with a damaged plane, St-Ex teaches us to look at theadult world through the eyes of a child. The little princegave the narrator the sound of laughter to accompanythe stars in the nighttime sky... he will be happy to sharehis insights with you as well."
5,A Book to Read for a Lifetime,"This book gets 6 stars! Antoine de SaintExupery, though writing at a level at which children can comprehend the plot, delves deep into a social and psychological discussion regarding the human experience. He has a profound understanding of the way 'adults' (modern society) incorrectly view the world, its citizens, and what they have to offer. Lessons taught by this book range from personal relationships to business, touching on the subjects of guilt, greed, power, and love. While all of these topics are thoroughly discussed, you never feel as if you're being lectured or hit over the head with symbolism. So much is buried between the lines that one reading of this book will not suffice to gain the infinite wisdom it possesses. Read it as a coming-of-age story for society: once every few years for the rest of your life. This simple, 96 page story about a little boy speaks volumes louder than you could imagine."
5,"This is a wonderful, wonderful book.","This little story is not just for children at all. I first read this book when I was 14, and I have probably re-read it more than 20 times since, once even in the German translation. It is simply beautiful and true."
1,"Unprofessional rendering of a book, looks like cheap Chinese knock-off","Couldn't believe my eyes when this arrived. One of the worst quality books I've ever seen. As you can see in the ""click to look inside,"" which I regrettably did not do before purchasing, the front and back covers are gigantic blow-ups of low-quality JPEGs. There is no copyright page. The ink is cheap; the whole thing looks, smells and feels cheap. It's an unprofessional rendering of a book that looks like a cheap Chinese knock-off.There is no information in the book itself on who could have produced this obscenity. That's no surprise; I'd be embarrassed to have published this, too. I will be returning it forthwith. I'm incredulous that this seems to be the only paperback version of The Little Prince on Amazon. It's godawful. Saint-Exupéry would be turning in his grave if he knew of this abomination."
5,the best book in the world!!!,"i was 14 years old and very lost when a friend who i had seen as a very wise person handed me this book to read. at first i thought eh its a chileds book, and it is if you don't READ it. when unraveling the lines and looking beyond the story into the messege i opened my eyes for the first time and saw what the world was realy about. now (as maney of my friends do) i carry this book around in my back pocket. we all have highlighted pages. this is truley the best book i have ever read in my whole life!!!!!!!!!"
1,sorry to say this but my friend never got the book!,Sorry but never got neither book no reply. And on top of that I payed for immediate shipment !!!Hope next time it will go betterRoberto Cugnaschi
3,It's a book - well written,"A very well written book with insight to morals in a demoralized world. I enjoyed the choice of words used by Antoine, however, do not feel that this is a book for a child to read, but to be read to. If you find you enjoy this book then check out the Holy Bible...you'll find some of the same philosophies regarding love for an individual and much more."
2,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"I found the little prince to be a complete waste of time. It is basically a book of protest of what makes society evil. If you feel th way the author does it isn't worth your time because you should be out fixing the world. If you disagree with it, it will just highly agitate you."
1,Is this stupid or what?,"What a really stupid book. For me anyway, it is very unrealistic. I mean like, how did the Little Prince travel from planet to planet with a flock of birds? Hey give me a break. When he entered earth, how come he didn't burn in the atmosphere? This book is just some sort of fairy tale. I know this book has some values to teach but the values are not taught in hte right way. How come it cannot just be said in a straightforward manner? This is supposed to be a kid's book. There are so many underlying meaning hidden within the lines which most of the readers don't even understand. Or, when they do, hey we know those things that this book is trying to teach already. Get to the point!"
1,"Boring, a waste of my time",I would rate this book with zero stars but I was unable to do so. Unfortunately I was forced to purchase this book for a class. It was a major waste of money in my opinion. If I had children I would NEVER submit them to this book. I found no point to the story at all. I wish I could get my money back as well as the time I wasted on reading it.
5,This book has inspired me since I first read it,I had read this in highschool and for some reason all the lessons that my teacher had explained about it really stuck with me. I can only look at this book with fondness and is the first thing that comes to mind when some one asks me what my favorite book is. Even if it is technically 'for kids' I think that is one of the points of the book- adults should be able to enjoy the same amount of joy and imagination as children.If you have kids I defiantly almost insist that you read this to them.
5,A Time Tested Classic,"If I was stranded on a desert island and could only take one book with me, it would be this one. It does not matter how many times I read this book over the years, every time I pick it up, it is as if I was reading it for the first time. I realize something new and profound with every reading.This little book is so compact with depth of meaning and wisdom, it is truly as timeless as wisdom itself. If you know of any child, please get them a copy of this book. It is one of those magical tales that is destined to become a lifelong favorite for them.No wonder it is actor James Dean's favorite book.... and I'm not one to argue with James Dean."
5,One of the greatest children's books ever written. . .,". . .and extremely profound for ""grown-ups"" as well.Antoine De Saint-Exupery's timeless classic ""The Little Prince"" should be on the shelf of every child -- especially the homeschooled child -- in America. It teaches love, friendship, commitment, perseverence, etc. all with a wonderful dose of humor aided by the rich illustrations of the author.The book is also useful for teaching children about the very real evils in the world: greed, hate, fear, etc. It also explores death in a serious yet incredibly tender way. Parents, get this book and read it with your children. You will never be sorry you did so.(As a matter of personal preference, I prefer the older English-language translation to the recent re-do -- but that is a minor point.)It is interesting to note that not long after writing this book, De Saint-Exupery was himself lost in a plane over the Sahara. Neither he nor his plane were ever recovered."
2,this translation is not the greatest,"The Little Prince is of course a delightful and meaningful book. I, however, am not fond of this translation by Richard Howard. At a glance, this and the earlier translation by Katherine Woods seem similar enough, but if you have seiously read and fallen in love with the Woods translation you can detect the ways in which the newer translation lacks in portraying the characters' personalities, and the story. The new translation just sounds like someone trying to make money off of an old classic without worrying about copywrite infringement. I seriously and desperately recommend you purchase the Woods translation if you can find it."
3,Amazing book but came with a small flaw,"The pop-up version is very well made. All the bits appear sturdy and they have really put thought into making each page to portray the story. The book itself is an excellent gift however, mine arrived with a red pen marking on the side. It's not a really big deal for me but that could be a serious flaw for people who collect books and etc. The seller needs to pay more attention to what is sent!"
1,Horrible Translation,"As this is my all-time favorite book, I have read (and own) several copies of this book. I was excited to see this newest edition until I picked it up and read it. This is a direct translation from the original French and that kills a lot of the beauty of this piece. My advice is to buy a copy translated by Katherine Woods. This is the translation that was originally published in English and is just beautiful."
2,another example of newest is not better,This newest version loses the feeling that made this book a classic. Also the illustrations were black drab and weak. Lesson learned on not doing homework when ordering a classic. Very disappointing!!! It only gets two stars due to its heritage!
1,Too Small A Book,A bit disappointed in this paperback edition of The Little Prince being so very small and the art work being so ill defined.Service was fine.
5,How stupid look like _SOME_ reader ?????,"Hi,Im born in Europe, where is born St-Exupéry. I read ""The little Prince"" when I was 7 yo, and this stories follow me all my life. I never read it again, but I listed lot of time the stories, at office, at home or anywhere. Sometime, I do not listen this storie during 2 or five year, but each time I listed her, I have always something. I read in some comment that some poeple see just a stories between a fox and a child. Other ask them how can the little prince be in Sahara, and other see a suicide...I can't figure me so stupid interpretation of the petit prince. And the life of St-Exupéry, with all other great pilot should be also reading. St-Exupéry is really a GREAT men, that have give is point of view with the simplest way as possible, and with the more in deepth subject. Sorry for my bad english."
1,"received a bootlegged, illegal copy","I ordered a *new* copy of The Little Prince from Amazon and received a bootlegged copy of the book. Most likely illegal. There are typos, and the illustrations are photocopied, black & white, reduced in size, poor quality, and pixelated. The book is not formatted or designed like the original. There is no publisher listed, no copyright, no information about who printed and distributed the book. What's worse is that I sent it as a gift, but luckily the person who received it understood what happened. I want my money back, and I don't think that the recipient should have to go through the trouble of returning the book because Amazon messed up."
5,The most soulful book on the planet.,"This book has been a guide in the main search of my life. It is a breathtaking soulful book that with genius simplicity makes you think! I must recomend it for readers of any age. Anyone would find something new, incredible and very important for them regardless of the reader's age, place in life, time in the universe and number of times read."
4,Le Petit Prince,When i read this book i was taken to a world of wonder. It could turn every bad day good.
3,Pretty good,"The story's pretty good, but it might be a little too deep or somewhat boring for the average young child. The messages the book sends are rather opaque, which may be why adults like it so much. I know a lot of adults like ""The Little Prince"", but I have yet to hear a preteen say they liked it all that much - most of them, I think, find it boring."
3,one scratches one's head,"I read this in ninth grade--both in English and (though I studied Spanish) in French--and I found it reasonably enjoyable, reasonably funny, and charged with a small number of reasonably significant life lessons. Other than that--though I've read it as an adult and, yes, even re-re-reread it--I honestly can't see the fuss."
1,Lost Me!,"I read part of this in French class in high school. I remember wondering why we were supposed to read it. Now as an adult, re-reading it I still wonder. I don't really see what the hype is about. Is it a childrens story? Is it sad? Hard to say. This premise is that there is a little prince who comes to Earth and meets adults. He finds most adults to be too interested in the day-to-day world that they live in. He wants to go home to his planet and care for his flower ... so he uses a snake to get there. Sound strange? Read it and find out for yourself."
5,New outlook on life,"At first, I thought this book was the strangest book I had ever read. I wondered why I had to read this. I was to old for this! I told myself. However, you don't get the true meaning of the book until you reflect on it. Almost every page has a deeper meaning than first meets the eye. The lessons tought in this book will change your outlook on life, and make you think about life in a different way. I am glad I read this book and would definitly recomend it to everyone, young and old."
5,Do you ache?,"Do you ache? Do you search the streets below and the heavens above, wondering, hoping that somewhere out there there is someone who thinks of you often, and longs to be close to you? I used to. Then I met The Little Prince. He taught me more about the nature of truth and friendship than I could ever put into words. I understand now that love is more than the feeling of wanting to be near, and that the pain felt in a friend's absence enhances the joy felt in that friend's presence. Friends are rare and they are precious. But once you meet them, they stay with you forever.Do you ache? Does loneliness make its home in the center of your chest? If it does, then let me help you. Let me introduce you to The Little Prince."
5,The most creative book I've ever read,"The Little Prince is such a hell of a work. I really enjoyed reading it! It's a very heart-warming work and I can't help falling in love with the story. I hope that everybody could read this, I know that even the adults would like the story. A great, inspiring work. I salute the author for coming up with such a creative story like the little prince."
4,a children's book in disguise,"You can read it to a child, but this is definitely not a children's book; you can have a long discussion about it with fellow adult friends. There are so many deeper meanings and inferences behind everything. It gets you thinking, the simultaneous simplicity and complexicity of the book stays with you; after finishing you might think it a bit haunting.Easily read in one sitting, it captivates you because you have so many questions in your head and you just have to know what happens next. The author's 1-page biography is also captivating, and only makes the story more meaningful."
5,Why Why Why?,"Why is this called a Children's Book? I just gave it to one of my grandchildren on their 12th birthday. Some computer program may tally up the vocabulary, the grammar, the sentence length and say it is 9-12 year old reading level, but that IS NOT COMPREHENSION LEVEL! ! !I had to think long and hard to decide this grandchild is mature enough to deal with this book now. I know many adults for whom it all just slides off and leaves them with only the question ""what's the big deal about this book?"""
1,must not read,"This is the worst book i have ever read! It is confusing! It is silly! it is WIERD! This is because its about a lunatic little kid (the little prince) who can talk to a flower on his planet. The flower talks back and says she wants a glass case. Then the little prince trys to find one but he goes to all these other planets where ""greedy"" grown ups are! the little prince decides greed is bad and hates the planets he lives by! So he kills himself. Then in his so called after life he is in his planet with his flower again. Happy happy the end!"
2,Was the author on something,ok another book book we had to read (and rewirte) in english. Basically the story is about a pilet who gets stranded in the desert and meets the little prince. TLP then tells him his life story starting on his own planet and then going on his trip to earth. Durring the book there are several refferences to drugs and stuff like that. It scares me that four year olds like this book. They are basiclly reading a book on how drugs are good.
2,The Little Prince...I Don't really like it.,"This books is just not my type of book. I did not really get anything from this book because I have to go over the metaphors before I can understand it. Anyways, this book tells the grown ups all over the world that they can still use their imaginations even though they have matured and have a job. This is some connections I heard from Einstein. Einstein said that Imaginations are more important than knowledge because Imagination creates knowledge. This book made me read it even though I wasn't very interested to it because it makes me think deeply of some words that are hard to understand and while I read the book, it reminded me of my childhood because I use to use my imaginations, ofcourse, probably all the kids use their imaginations. Now that I have grown, I forgot about imagining because I've grown up a lot. Just like in the book, when the little prince was growing up, he is losing his imaginations."
2,Be thankful this book is short,"I read this book (as an adult) since I heard it being so often mentioned alonside The Alchemist. The Little Prince is no where near in the same class as The Alchemist and I was sorely disappointed. This is truly a book for small children only...any adult (or child for that matter) with even a half developed brain will find this book ambigious, boring and even a little insulting...on the upside it reads quickly and the tedious pain is over quickly."
1,PPPPBBBBBHHHHTTTT!,"A flop of a book. Very structurally unsound. I see what all the hullabaloo is about, I can understand the symbolism, but I find it a very useless vehicle for points that had been easily made by other sources. I find it much closer to the French than the Katherine Woods translation, having had to read both of them very recently. I will burn ""The Little Prince"" copies I have in my possession as soon as I possibly can."
4,Book of Imagination,"This book is about a little boy who is from a planet far away discovered not long ago. The planet is about as big as and average sized house. Wow, that's small! This is a very interesting book, not a book that will excite you, but it is a fun book to read. It is not a very long book at all, but it is long enough to take about two days if you are an average reader. My favorite part is when The Little Prince finds the snake and talks to him. I think that this book is a bit confusing, but after I read all of it, it made perfect sense. This is a book I think everyone can enjoy. In this book you have to use your imagination. It will take you from planet to planet and all around the world and galaxy. I think you should read this great book."
5,No need to say...,"Hey~~ I think I have no need to say. Just read it, or I should say FEEL it. Don't use your eyes to read this book but your heart. The most essential is invisible to eyes, right?"
5,A once a year must read,Wonderful story about how to handle those silly adults concerned with very serious things - and to remember what is really important in life. I look forward to sharing with my children as they grow up.
1,"NOT the ""real"" english translation of this profound book!","The original Katherine Woods translation of this book is wonderful. This new translation by Richard Howard doesn't come close. Look for the original translation in used book stores or veiw it online. Some things should never be redone. This redo is the literary equivalent of the Michael Bolton version of Percy Sledge's ""When a Man Loves a Woman"". If, by reading this review, just one person ends up reading the Katherine Woods translation instead of the one by Richard Howard, I will consider the time it took to write it well spent."
5,"It's a ""must-have"" wherever i go","I love this book. I didn't get to read until i was already a grown-up, but that made it even more meaningful. It's the first book a ever read with my husband when we first married. I recommend it, not only for kids (because you will obviously find it in the Children's section) but for adults, for those grown-ups that want to stick this book in a kids shelf because they think it would be childish to read it. Read it. You won't regret it... and i'll asure you'll treasure its simple but deep teachings."
5,The Best,"If every person in the world read this book, we would live great times! My dad gave to me when I first learned to read... As I will to to my sons with I have any....And this edition is beautiful!"
5,Not Only for Kids,"Le Petit Prince has been written by a French aristocrat poet and writer known as Antonie de Saint-Exupéry and published in 1943.The little prince is the antithesis of human nature during the second world war with its loneliness, selfishness and blindess of ourselves portraited by the boa constrictor.The boa constrictor has the ability of enchant and then spread the seed of the selfishness in another organism like the little prince mainly because he has not been ""tamed"" by the humans.Politically speaking the little prince is a good politician because he takes care of his little planet and its inhabitants for a common good.Fortunately the description of the human nature is not yet at the end but inside us there is the hope of a better world with a reasons and ideals.In my opinion another symbolism of the human race is the ""baobas"" i.e. a sort of Babel's tower were the humans won't be able to communicate between them properly for a lack of a divine guide.CheersIP"
1,"10 Star Book, 1 Star Translation","Please, people, do not waste your time on the Richard Howard translation. It is childish, simplified, and simply awful. I really think that Richard Howard took this phenomenal, amazing book and tried to make it as devoid of meaning as he could. The new translation is almost like how a five year old would tell it- small, small words and small, small ideas.However- I had the Katharine Woods translation before I bought this one. Do not blame this new error on the author. The Katharine Woods translation is superb. Richard Howards- Not so much.This review has nothing to do with the book, just its differing translations."
3,translation cause story to lose some beauty,"I grew up reading this lovely story and when the pages fell out of my original I went to Amazon for a new one.However, the new translation took the beauty out of the story that I had felt in earlier readings, in my opinion.The story remains a wonderful one, but I would suggest reading the Katherine Woods translation for comparison. The language in the original translation is beautiful, creative and inspiring. I felt the newer translation was less poetic."
5,magical,"This is an almost religous book. I rate it as one of the best books I have ever read. It contrasts with complicated ""philosophical"" books as one which uses simple words, is a parable that can be understood at different levels, and contains a few profound ideas - but more than anything else - will touch your heart.If you wish to grow young again, read it andhis other ""Wind, Sand and Stars"""
2,not so good,"This is a copy of the original. Yet, it has the same price. It's not colored which was annoying because it has many pictures."
3,good gift,This was bought as a gift for a grandson and I have not read it but the reviews I have read were highly positive and I feel the contents of the book a fiting gift for anyone and any sex and any age!
1,Be forewarned.,"At first, I really liked this book. I didn't care about the cheap materials used to make it, because I only paid about [...] bucks for it. Then at about page 92 or so, it all of a sudden skipped back to page 33!! I was missing about 32 pages of material that had been replaced with material from earlier in the book! I was so pissed I could scream! I want to get a legit copy of this, because mine was so worthless I threw it into the garbage. Just to let you know, this is the only book with which I have ever had this problem."
2,Not What I Expected,"I found the book of limited usefulness because it addresses only a specific type of garden--the formal, country house garden, with clipped hedges, topiary, statues, paved pathways, and fountains. If this is the type of garden you are planning to create, you may find this book helpful--although the advice is largely theoretical, and directed towards garden design professionals."
4,Good study guide but be careful,"Book contains excellent examples to work from. It is written upon the premise that you are new to GIS and will walk you through the understanding of GIS process' without trying to sell you a specific ""software or program"" for GIS. I found what I felt to be one error and have submitted an inquiry to the publisher. Page 38 has an end of the chapter review type quiz (as each chapter has). The answers which are in the back of the book I felt did not and could not coincide with the actual data given for the quiz.Overall the book is effective at the process of familiarizing a person with the different aspects of the GIS community."
5,Great hoodie!,"My brother said his hoodie arrived very fast and was surprised by the quality of it. Also, the color is great!"
2,"Poor condition, could have done better.","I gave this item 2 stars instead of one because it did arrive on time. Other than that the hoodie was poorly preshrunk where the zipper doesn't align right and you have to fight with it to zip it up. And after normal wear, one week later a two inch rip has appeared on the inner seam of the right arm, a result from all of the lose strings that had to be cut away as the stitching in various places was coming undone when it was first opened. This shirt is warm I will admit and though it was very badly preshrunk, it was not faded. I like the oversized hood and simply wish the shirt was taken care of better on the factory's side. Their methods for prewashing do a number on the shirt and the seams could have been better sewn. At this price its a bad buy, this shirt is something you'd find in the $5 bargain bin in a department store and shouldn't be going for the $20 they're asking for it before the shipping and handling even."
3,Its Not That Thick,"This is a decent zip-up hoodie - for the money. HOWEVER (and its a big HOWEVER) its actually not all that thick. Its more like 'standard' thickness. I was specifically looking for a very THICK, warm hoodie (to help save on my gas bill). This one is even described by the maker as 'heavy blend' but its sort of not. However, it is a nice hoodie, and the price is about right, so I'm keeping it."
4,Zip Zop Zoobity Zap,"Very comfortable and durable. The zipper is solid and doesn't seem like it will break off, like my last hoodie's did.One thing I noticed about this hoodie is that is caused more static electricity issues for me than my old ones ever did. It might be worth getting some anti-static spray if you live / work in an environment where this could become an issue.This also isn't a replacement for a winter coat. It is certainly warm, but it is at its best in 40-70 degree temperatures. It also fits nicely under a winter coat if you really need to bundle up.The best feature of this hoodie is the price. It is a steal at $23.If you are looking for a comfortable, durable, and inexpensive hoodie, you can't go wrong with this product."
5,Nice,Warm and comfortable. Very pleased and a good price. Looked for one at some stores to thin and not as well made.
5,SO happy I got this!,"So my husband got a few sweatshirts a while back and loved them, but they began to pill up and just look bad, so we have been looking for months to find a replacement and had no luck locally. I did some research because he is a bit picky when it comes to the weight of his sweatshirt, too thick and he gets to hot, and too thin it is cold and falls apart. Anyway, this shipped SUPER FAST, and he has not even stopped wearing it long enough for me to wash it! It looks super sharp and it is the absolute perfect weight. Good enough to keep warm, but move around to do things. You will be happy with this purchase for sure!!"
2,Loved it at first.....,"Took a little bit longer to install than I thought it would, but I wanted it done RIGHT. First try after installing it and it worked great!!! It worked great for about 3 months, then the range kept getting shorter and shorter, till I had to be within 5 FEET of the vehicle!!!! (for locks AND starter) -- what good is a remote starter if you have to be 5 feet from vehicle?!Company DID replace the main box, so I didn't have to do any re-wiring. Just took the old box to the store and they opened a new one for the exchange. GREAT!!!! But the SAME THING happened. Worked for about 5 months, then the range got shorter and NOW it doesn't work at all. Even after LOTS of re-programing attempts, and re-grounding the system. Sure the price is right, but I still expect the product to work!"
1,"Poor product, bad service!","I bought a Remote Start System and it does not work. The switch is always conductive on both positions. The system can not be programmed. The instructions are inconsistent from the booklet and their pre-recorded tech support message. The CD doesn't provide any useful information. They don't grant warranty if you bought it from on-line. (even if they do, you still have to pay $20!)"
1,American Pie clone,"Sweet Potato Pie is an exact clone of American Pie, down to the sex scene with a pie. The movie is less funny than Pie and it's not as riske. Every scene has rap music, even if it adds nothing too the scene. Sweet Potato had potential, but ends up being a lame wannabe."
5,Great blades,"These blades are a copy of the brand Valeo who has had this style of blade when before Bosch ever made them. These and the Valeo's are the best wiper blades I have ever used and I would never go back to the old style. I had my last set of Valeo wiper blades installed for almost two years and they were still working perfectly when I sold the car. You can buy the Val,eo blades at Tirerack dot com for $19.95 each BUT it's buy one get one free so for about $10 for each blade, they are a steal. They will last you for a long time compared to the older style of blades. These type never streak, never squeak and are simple to install. You'll never use any other blade if you try these. That I promise!"
1,Cannot install.,"It would be most helpful if the description of this item included a list of car models that the adapters included do not work for. I have a 2003 Saturn LW300 Wagon, no dice."
4,Dynamite flashbacks,"Awesome. Cook breaks the rules with his dynamite flashbacks showing the relationship of childhood friends, Ray and Jackson. I haven't seen this done with such skill in a long time, and the ending was truly a surprise. As Jackson reconstructs the circumstances surrounding his friend's death, Cook draws in the reader effortlessly. If you like Thomas Cook's style and treatment of flashbacks, you will love Laurie Moore's new novel, THE LADY GODIVA MURDER. Mariel Watson"
3,Unfortunately,"Unfortunately I read this book after INSTRUMENTS OF NIGHT (which was published later). The two books are similar in plot and tone, but I liked INSTRUMENTS much better. Thomas Cook is always an interesting read, but this one didn't quite measure up. It was strung out a little more, more pointless details, slower moving and the mystery was not as riveting. It was still better than most books though, and I plan on reading all of this books."
2,"Slow, plodding tale with uninteresting main character","I was very disappointed with this book. It started off nicely with spooky atmospherics and some gruesome details. But once the plot actually got moving, it became bland and also disjointed. The prose obstructed the telling of the story. It was like molasses. Also, the story meandered, with little suspense. Finally, while it's not indispensable in a mystery, it would be nice to have a few clues, however abstruse, tossed into the plot as it moves along (sarcasm!). And now for a positive: if you want to read a good book, read one of Michael Connely''s, especially Void Moon, The Poet, Trunk Music, The Black Echo and The Wild Coyote."
5,Quite Probably the greatest,"When I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey I was positively amazed. I knew instantly that this would be known as the greatest film ever. The visual epic gives the sense of mystery and adventure as your mind embarks on a journey through the discovery of mankind and brings up questions you never thought of before. The film gives different impressions for each person, but for someone who knows film and metaphysics the impression is always positive."
2,Unhappy about the whole thing!,"First of all Amazon shipped me the pan and scan version instead of the wide screen version I ordered. Unfortunately, I did not realize it until I unwrapped the darn thing.Second, the quality of the picture was poor. For example, space scenes had white specks that were not stars.I would have given the tape one star if it wasn't such a good movie. :("
2,Why do this movie get so many stars?,"I was derrible dissappointed the first time I saw the movie. Many years later when I saw the movie again the feeling just deepend. And when I read the text in the reviews that gives it five stars, it is embarassing. - It seems like political correct talks that someone has lulled themself into believing it. - The movie has some great scenes. But I think the baloney about it may make someone red faced ten years from now."
1,A classic film?? I think not!!!,"The cinematography is the best there is, but why does it have to be so boring, don't get me wrong I really like science fiction movies and especially love Stanely Kubrick films ( A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket) there seem to be no story here. A classic film?? I think not!!!"
5,"Amazing movie, sacreligous packaging",WHY IS THE SPACE BABY ON THE COVER???????What next?A new edition of 'Empire Strikes Back' with Darth Vader cradling Luke in a maternity ward on the cover?'The Sixth Sense' special edition DVD featuring a picture of Bruce Willis with a sheet over his head?'Seven' - 2 disc edition with a 3D hologram of Gwyneth's severed head in a box?YOU PUT THE ENDING ON THE FRONT COVER OF THE DVD YOU KNUCKLEHEADS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR(By the way this is the best film ever made)
2,zzzzzz,"Just finished watching it. What a snooze fest. While ,for the time, the special effects for space were great except they did look heavy for being on the moon. The rest was sooo boring. So very disappointed. This sucked the energy out of me so badly i cant bother to write a full review."
2,Hummmmm,I'm not really a big Kubrick fan. It's soo long and the story drags me to sleep. I can't believe I spent money for this.
3,A Beautiful Transfer,"I have a midrange system. 35"" RCA TV with RCA connections between my receiver, TV and DVD player...and this movie looked phenomenal. I literally could not understand how the visuals in this film were done 30 years ago. Very few movies now can pull off cinematography like this. The DVD is visually stunning. Which is a good thing, because the story is slow, ambiguous, and heavily reliant on visuals to carry the pace. An important film, a milestone in cinema, and a movie you really need to be in the mood for to enjoy."
4,"I respect it, but it is not my favorite","I first saw this movie when I was about 12. I really didn't get it then....after watching it many years later for the 2nd time, I appreciate what is being done, but at the same time, the plot is very puzzling and leaves so much to the imagination that I really didn't enjoy it like Dune or other sci-fi movies of high quality. I wanted to really like it, but in reality, that was not the case."
3,I'm extraordinarily mediocre on this film,"Don't expect an action movie. There are no explosions, or take-offs for that matter. It's a fun look at what the future was like way in the past. ""Space Opera"" is the best description I've heard. The dynamics are what struck me the most. Half the time, the sound of the disk spinning (which I'd never heard before) seemed loud, then when the music comes up, you'd be hard-pressed to hear a train go by outside the window. I won't say the sound was terrific, but at least there is some surround and real bass. HAL is in your head."
2,Huh?,I'm sure there is something worthwhile in this movie but beats me if I can figure out what it was. Fortunately I checked it out from the library and didn't waste any money on it.
2,"The movie made no sense, despite awe-inspiring moments.","Sure, the scenes with the monkeys and the monolith held me in abeyance, but the movie made no sense. What was the director on? What the hell was the scene with the aged astronaut in the room toward the end of the movie? Even more baffling was the embryo at the end. A highly overrated movie."
2,Long and boring....,"Stanley Kubrick definetly forget the reason most people see movies.. it's to be entertained. I like the story but the scenes are drawn out and boring. Yes, it contains information that was way before it's time and it has great music but the movie itself fails to hold the audiences attention IMO."
4,intertaining,I always enjoyed any movie about outer space. This one was very interesting & had beautiful scene's. Even the very beginning with the apes.
3,Satisfied,"This is a fairly basic edition, nothing special in the packaging. Movie looks and sounds great. The only negative is that the case came with one of the clamps broken, so only the top snaps shut."
5,"my God, it's full of stars","When I was 8 years old, my dad took me to see this film in a theatre. My life has forever been changed. The questions it asked led to me becoming an English major and writer, the music has influenced my love of classical music. And the film inspired me to see other Kubrick films;Barry Lyndon, Shining, Paths of Glory. Too bad Eyes Wide Shut was so bad."
5,my god...it's full of stars!,"o.k. this is it. and i mean it! do you want to be really happy about spending the money to go hd? this is your movie.i already loved this movie, always have, and this was the hd transfer it deserved. absolutely fantastic!! i am too young to have seen this in the theater so the first time i saw it was on vhs. of course when i caved in and switched to dvd, this was one of the first movies i bought. now i have hd so i absolutely had to see what this disc had to offer.i was not disapointed.if you are a fan of this film, it is a must have. if you are not familiar with this film, there is a reason why it makes everyones top hd release lists. if you don't like this film... you are dead inside and should consider living in a cave in the wild so as to not interupt human evolution and progress."
3,remake without credit given,"This film looks so much like a remake of the 1960 Italian film, Assignment: Outer Space, I even have to wonder about the title; 2001: Space Oddyssey is even formulated the same way - word, colon, two words.Pretty much all of the ""ground breaking"" ideas in 2001, are already there in Assignment; from hybernation to make it through a long journey to a force to be reckoned with exacerbated by an out-of-control computer that kills a pilot. In Assignment, top secret military information is kept from a reporter. In the 2001 movies, the information is kept from HAL's inventor. Both characters end up solving the problem in the end."
2,ahead of it's time. but does not age well for a new generation,"Just watched this movie. Have been interested in watching all the Kubrick films since he is hailed as a top director of his time. Anyways... 2001 a space odyssey is fairly interesting. being a movie that i guess came out in 1968 I can see this being an epic mindblow of proportions. it has great scenes, soundtrack, ideas and visuals. so i can understand all the praise the movie has. but really if this movie had come out in today's age 2010 i don't know. think it would have been a love it or hate it movie that would fade away into obscurity. personally i dont' know... it's decent but nothing i would praise or watch again. i do and can understand people that watched this in it's origninal release still seeing it as great for what it is and i can understand that. anyways... epic for 60's. ok for 2010. the visuals playing orchestrated music did nothing for me. seemed like more of a way to make the movie longer and kill time"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Is this the film that made current film critics think they had a talent at picking good films because they liked this one. Maybe I'm off my rocker (actually I slept through most of this one in my rocker) but this film can't be the seminal moment in science fiction movies. This one makes almost as much sense as that other ""great"" science fiction epic, Rocky Horror Picture Show."
1,A film for the arts,"I really hated this film. It is the only film I have not been able to sit through and watch the whole thing.This film was recommended to me by a lot of my friends as a film that requires watching simply for the cultural value it holds. In this respect I'm sure it was a wonderful film and brilliant for its time.However, I really cannot see how half an hour of monkeys jumping around followed by a further half hour of haunting music can induce anyone to sit through the rest of the film without forcing themselves to.I felt obligated to watch it so that I would be able to reflect on the cultural experience it was trying to put across. However, the film just bored me and I just went out leaving it running.I didn't like this film at all."
2,Long and Boring,A saw this movie as a kid and didn't remember how boring it was. The special effects were great way back when but nothing special at today's standards.
1,"Forget Nytol, This is My Sleep Aid","C'mon people this really is not a good movie. I understand the ""groundbreaking"" aspects of the film but there isn't even a true plot. Symbolism is present as man grows blah, blah, blah. If Kubrick had wanted to create an art form on the growth of man through the ages then for Godsakes he should have written a five paragraph pamphlet. That would have been more interesting. I'm sorry to those that think this is the greatest movie ever, I'm not trying to insult you, I just think this is a waste of time.Try reading The Discoverers, by Daniel J. Boorstin"
1,this movie sucked,"i rented the 25th anniversary of this movie hoping id be amazed when it finished..i was dead wrong. i was bored throughout the entire movie. it basically had 45 mins of the entire damn movie that there was actual dialogue. the rest of the movie was pure music, and everybody breathing hard. 33 mins went by showing the stupid apes playing around with bones...and the rest was pure crap. no offense to kubrick, but i hated this movie, and i hope i never have to see it again...ever"
1,2001 A Space Drudgery,"Maybe it's because I was dropping in and out of consciousness because of the incredibly dull, uninspiring story, or maybe it went over my head because I was so mind numbingly bored, but i just don't understand the high ratings this movie has received.This is obviously a product of the 60s-70s era, the producer in his obvious drug induced hippie state, fell in love with a lava lamp and and decided to share the special effects of this lamp with constant and ridiculous monotony, what an absolute waste of 2 hours!I fell cheated, I would have had more enjoyment flushing my $15 than watching this piece of trash."
4,Sci-Fi Classic,2001 - A Space Odyssey [HD DVD]High Def quality gives superb added dimension to the creative cinematography already present in this movie.
4,2001 still one of the best for realistic special effects,"Despite the fact that not all of the elements of this film are from original sources, it still looks fantastic after 40 years. One of my favorite science fiction films. The new detail visible in the HD transfer had me trying to read all of the dials and panels just to see what they actually say. Color looks fantastic - especially the subtle changes in lighting throughout the spaceship Discovery. Fantastic."
1,God this movie sucks,I had to leave the room after about thirty minutes. I couldn't take it anymore. What the hell kind of jack a s s movie is this. Wish I could return it
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ Boring movie ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. It is mentioned in every film history book as being classic and one of the best films of all time. But after seeing it, I thought it was the most boring film of all time. There was no action. I sat through the whole thing and there was no real value to it. There was not enough dialogue and the movie was way too long. It was a boring watch. I don't know why it gets such good reviews, but it is just not a work of art. The cinematography was not even that great. The story was somewhat hard to follow. I would recommend skipping this one. It is not worth it."
1,Mind-numbingly boring.,"This film is a prime example of how ridiculous films most people thought were ""deep"" and ""conceptual"" in the 60s have proven themselves to be nowadays. This movie can be accurately summed-up in one word: boring. It is unbelievably dull, with ""arty"" subject matter, and entire passages of film up to 20 minutes long without anyone speaking! Who would ever want to watch this if they weren't hopped up on drugs of some kind? The answer: nobody sane."
2,You Call This a Movie?,"Reviewers call this movie ""puzzling, provocative, and perfect""; I found it baffling, bothersome, and boring.It is essentially a 2 1/2 hour long special effects display. The dialogue is scarce; the action, nonexistent. It is full of interminable sequences of ships drifting through space which do zilch to advance the story and could have been dramatically shortened without hurting the movie.The plot, if you can call it a plot, is difficult to follow and bears little resemblance to Arthur C. Clarke's novel. The story just doesn't hang together. Viewers are left waiting for an explanation that never comes. The bizarre ending is particularly maddening.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
1,2001 a space odyssey,"The book 2001,A Space odessey is a glance at the world from a different point of view. The book shows just how much we have evolved from the beging of time. From the first ape-man to the world today. It also shows just how litte we know about artificial intelligence and that there may even be existing life on other planets such as,Saturn, that have been in existance billions of years before us humans. Maybe we have been in denial, or even just to dumb to realize the clues.Now it's time to explor the unknown. David Bowman and his two crewmates Frank Poole,and a state of the art robot with high intellectual knowlege are on a mission to Saturn to find out more about a virus that can potentualy spred. They face some difficult challanges along the way, that's when the book changes. The book is not the most interesting book with lots of action and drama, but it doses give you the authors oppinion on the human race and mankind as we know it."
2,"Great film, LOUSY print","Imagine my annoyance to realize that the power of DVD, composite video, and all that, has been employed to capture a rather worn, scratchy, and in some places broken print of the film. Utterly bootleg quality. For example, seconds after the famous bone-to-spacecraft segue, there is an obvious white crack in the celluloid! There are other obvious scratches and video artifacts, the overall picture quality is poor, and the sound is muddy! They couldn't find a better print or clean up the one they had? I've seen VHS copies that are better and my vinyl soundtrack album has more depth! Five stars for the film, zero stars for the reproduction effort."
3,Steelbook is really nothing special,"Essentially, the Steelbook version of any movie is simply the movie in a special package. Check out this video of the 2001 Steelbook - [...]The packaging is nice, but the movie is the same and there are no special bonuses inside."
4,2001 Space Odyssey DVD Review,I had not seen the movie in a while.Despite the miss in predicting our space program'sprogress (no moon base or manned planetary spaceship)the story with Artificial Intelligence in the HALcomputer is still relevant today. If you ignore the2010 sequel and don't read the book the movie's closingscenes still raises questions on what it all means.
3,Very trippy.,"I really did like this movie. It was long, but i watched it since i was very curious about it. Glad i did. Now im in the know with this movie if anyone ever talks about it.In a nutshell its about:LifeEvolutionand Death."
1,Don't buy this DVD - Poor Quality!!,After having seen some excellent quality DVDs I have to say that 2001 has been done a great injustice. This DVD is a VERY POOR transfer with visible artifacts in many of the deep space scenes. I agree with the other reviewers in that MGM should remaster and re-release this DVD.
4,The best copy of 2001 Space Odyssey in Blu-ray....,Keep in mind how old this movie is and then sit back and be blown away of how good it looks on the new Blu-Ray format! If you've seen it before then this will give you another great reason to watch it again like never before. If you haven't seen it before it may be a little slow because back when the film was made they did not use a lot of ambient music and such to fill that uncomfortable scilence you sometimes get on the older movies. There seem to be more of those then I can remember on this film but it's still one of the greatest and inspired a lot of great now classics and newer films as well. If you have a good 1080p set and Blu-Ray player then sit back and drool....
5,Awesome,"Just a great flick! Most older movies that go to blu-ray still maintain their grain and poor quality-(cough cough, terminator, cough) not this one! crystal clear, great sound, great movie. If you liked it back in the day, you need to get this copy!"
5,Still the Grandaddy of Science Fiction Films!!!,This new 2007 Digital Transfer is the best home video version I have ever seen. Crystal Clear Quality even down to the correct aspect ratio that Stanley originally intended. The original print was not in 2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. It was the same aspect ratio that was used in Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon. All the special features on the other disc is an absolute must too!I think the quality is so good it looks like it was made yesterday! and I think if Stanley was around today he would have given 2 thumbs up!Highly recommend to any fan of this film and must for classic film collectors.
5,Stanley Kubrick's Greatest Film,"What can I add to all that hasn't already been said about this movie? The techincal achievements of this film alone make it one the greatest movies of all time. Even though its visionary path was not followed and things turned out differently than was predicted, the story remains one of the most thought provoking and original stories that has ever been transferred to film. It is the pinnacle of the sci-fi genre and it was all hand made, not character generated on a computer like all of today's sci-fi movies are created. Both the HD an Blu Ray versions of this movie are superb. One thing I noticed on my last viewing that I had never noticed before was at the end of the movie when the Star Child was returning to earth, his eyes actually moved as if he were actually looking at the approaching earth."
5,"Movies Were Born For Experiences Like This., 2 Sep 2007","Plot:At the dawn of man, a mysterious monolith triggers an evolutionary leap in primates. Millennium later, a monolith uncovered on the moon emits a radio signal to Jupiter and a manned mission is sent to investigate. The only drawback is a psychotic and self-aware computer called HAL...My Review:Inspiring, influential, mind-blowing, and pretentious. Just to describe the film from several observation points a la scenes that define this film. The compelling and awe-inspiring alignment of sun and moon above the rim of the monolith; the docking shuttle and space station's orbital waltz; the circular crew habitat of the Discovery. It captures hearts and minds.Verdict:This movie makes it worth wile in the whole living experience. 9/10"
2,Is This A Movie Or An hour Of Classical Symphony Orchestra???,There is no dialogue until 20-25 minutes into the movie after the dawn of man scenes....Then there is a huge quantity of shots of space with an entire classical musical score in the background for several scenes which gets very annoying at times....
2,"Boring, watch #2","This movie id just about the slowest thing I've ever seen in my life. The movie really doesn't make any sense. It is a little scary, but that doesn't lower the high level of bordom. Watch the first one and then the second one and then you'll like both together as a complete story."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hated this movie. It was boring and pointless, specially the ending. What was the point? I know I am going to be accused of being uneducated or not sophisticated enough, but hey, you like what you like and I hated this one. Dr. Strangelove however was a masterpiece."
3,bad effects movie,THIS MOVIE HAD REALLY BAD EFFECTS IT WAS ALSO REALLY BORING I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I EVEN GAVE IT A STAR. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD HOTTER GUYS AND PRETTIER WOMEN IF I HAD TO RATE THIS OUT OF TEN I WOULD GIVE IT FIVE OUT OF TEN.
3,"Feature is a Masterpiece, the Extras are embarrasing!","I would love to know who authorized the downright amateurish, nearly laughable extras presented on this and most of the Kubrick Blu-Ray films I've purchased. This is a cinema masterpiece! And for all the care they took to preserve the film in Blu-Ray, they totally screwed up the behind-the-scenes pieces for the disks. Not only are they simply terribly produced (the music was obviously created by someone on a 1980's Casio Keyboard), the graphics, animation and production 'value' are simply embarrassing about a filmmaker who so heavily influenced other filmmakers like myself, and created a completely new and original visual language for the artform.The next time guys, I'd be happy to produce them for you...for free!"
1,Horrible Film,"I had to watch this movie for a class, & it was the most exhausting 3 hours of my life. This movie is ridiculous. Slow moving, pointless, & nearly impossible to watch. There were parts, where I thought it was going to get better, maybe there'd be some excitement..but even the ""dramatic"" parts moved at the pace of a sloth. I think the dialogue in this movie consisted of less than half, maybe even a quarter of the movie..if that! Otherwise, you heard nothing. You were in space. There was no sound. (I guess the noise fits the setting, but man was it tiring!!) Only thing I will say is that the movie itself worked great, & it was easy to rent & I appreciated that. However, I would not recommend this movie to anyone...unless you are looking for a sleep aid..this might help!"
2,Lou,"Here's the deal with this movie. The reason why it has great reviews is because the majority of people that are reviewing it now were around 12-14 years old when it was first debut (1968.) It must have been a stimulating experience back in 1968, with no other movie of its kind paralleling the beautiful special effects. Now 32 years later, they still watch the movie to re-capture the experience they had when they first saw it. Those who never had the experience when it first came out and watch it now will most likely not enjoy it. The space scenes are spectacular, but they have been done some many times since then that it gets old. There is no plot, climax or suspense. It's a slow paced, visual/musical film with no action. Although, those looking for a visual stimulation while on a mind-altering drug, this movie is it; will rock your world."
1,why do I need to look at a guy in a monkey suit for an hour.,"Alright this is a good plot, with the evolution and the mans destruction by technology. But the director absolutley screwed up. Can somebody say cut. I looked at this guy in a cheap monkey suit for 20 minutes. Nobody should have to do that. the nazis went easier on the jews."
2,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz..........................,"watching paint dry,grass grow,counting lines on your palms,grains of sand,or the absolute cure for insomnia.i cant bring myself to give such a great director 1 star.anyone else......btw,are humans the only species to evolve?!?!?!?!?not to trash on anothers beliefs but common sense dictate that i do.even schools arent buy that unicorn of a theory anymore."
2,Acquired Taste,"It may seem odd that the only real redeeming factor of a film meant to be ""intelligent"" is the eye candy. Even now- especially for the 60s- this film is spectacular in its visuals, and proves to us the overuse of CGI is not the only way to make people gaze in awe. The music is also tone-setting, eerie at times. But that's about it. The rest of the film is pretty much a borefest of epic proportions that tries to depict as many ""scientific"" possibilities about the future of space travel (that were supposed to come into fruition by '99) as possible while throwing in an alien first-contact story to make things interesting.At least the concept of the monolith was vaguely interesting, although sequel novels took the great idea and made even it fairly boring.Not recommended."
4,The problem with 2001 on blu-ray... let-down.,"The problem with 2001 on blu-ray is that sometimes you can just see too much detail - like brush strokes on the backdrops. The eye just smudges those things up on the big screen (cinema, not plasma) but in the home theater I just couldn't help cringing at how obviously the spacecraft looked like models.In comparison, my other BD view that day (sans sFX of any era) was outstanding on my system.I give absolutey NO discredit to the movie and all the skill/craft/love that is in it. I had immense expectations for watching this on BD and was let down by the detail."
5,Incredible!,"2001: A Space Odyssey is not as classical as it is made out to be. Some people say it is the best of Kubrick. Others say the best of all time. That, by me, is not quite correct. However, this remains one of the best of Kubrick and certainly one of the best sci-fi's of all time.There are excellent performances from a largely unknown cast - Keir Duella especially manages to impress in his magnificent lead role. The storyline is not what 2001 is now like, but hey, you can't help but stand up and cheer for Kubrick for such hard work into his accurate direction and scripting. HAL9000 is the real key to this movie though, he is probably one of the best movie villains ever, and although a computer-generated machine, is still a memorable 'character' in this extraodinary piece of art.2001: A Space Odyssey: A"
1,Can someone please explain the ending!!!,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid more than 22 years ago. I had nightmares after watching the ending. This certainly shouldn't have a G rating back then or even today.The ending is more disturing than the whole Pink Floyd The Wall movie.
1,"5 star film, 1 star DVD transfer","This great movie deserves a lot better than it got from MGM. The opening sequence is really badly done with grain visible all over the place. The mission sequence is better, with the exception of the constant flecks and sometimes gashes that appear on the frames. The film is being released for 2001. Supposedly it is also being cleaned up. Lets hope so. I find this disc hard to watch for what it could easily have been if Turner/MGM had spent a little money on it."
5,Blu-ray and beyond the infinite,"Yes, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has been released on Blu-ray, and I'm here to tell you that it has never looked better. Kubrick was kind enough to shoot the movie on 70MM film as if he knew we'd be watching movies on gigantic hi-def TVs in our homes one day. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood provide an entertaining commentary track, but oddly, they weren't sitting together as they recorded the track. I'm surprised by this as many of us have seen them together at autograph shows. In any case, the commentary track provides us with many behind the scenes stories as if they have been talking about this movie ever since it was released (which is most diffidently the case). Fire up your PS3, turn off the lights, gather your explosive bolts, and watch the most amazing movie ever made as you've never seen it before."
1,HORRIBLE DVD Transfer,"I am a real fan of this movie. That is one reason that I am so disappointed in the truly awful transfer that was made to DVD. The space scenes are muddy, with the whites, greys and blacks all blending together. There is significant banding on all of the contrasty scenes. The sound-track is scratchy.Part of the problem is that they placed the entire (long) film on one side of the DVD, so I am sure that there is too much compression for some of the material. But even there, it is obvious that the quality control was just plain poor. Warner should be ashamed of this performance.Compare this with some of the truly great DVD transfers to see what you are missing. My Fair Lady, for example, is a 70 mm film that was transferred with skill and care, and it is just glorious. 2001 defines the other end of the spectrum! Believe it or not, the VHS version looks better."
2,A major disappointment,"2001 is a brilliant movie, and deserves far more respect than it has been given with this awful DVD version.The image quality is dreadful; the star fields ripple with artefacts, and the whole thing looks like it was hastily transferred from a VHS tape.If you already own this on video tape, don't bother buying it on DVD, and hope for a better release in the future."
5,Great sound,"Got the blu ray edition. Vivid color. And the sound track is wonderful. The music, the sound effects are great on my Bose 901 speakers. One of the great, underrated sound tracks of all time."
5,A Classic!!,"2001 is a classic film that is truly amazing at it's best!!Stanley Kubrick knows how to make a great and interesting film that is also colorful, yet it still steers right onto the path of realism and fantasy.I recently purchased 2001 on Blu Ray and I will say that the picture quality is amazing and the colors are even better than ever!!It's truly a classic that deserves to be watched again and again!!5 stars for blu ray quality!!"
1,You have to read the book to understand it.,"Apparently, the creators of this film figured that everybodywho watched this movie had read the novel. I've been told that themovie makes sense after reading the novel. Well I never read a novel, and I didn't understand it. What was with the ending? The ending doesn't make sense. It seems like they cut out different parts of the film and put them back together randomly."
2,"Don't be another follower, the movie isn't good","Be an individual for gods sake people. I can understand how some people would like this movie since they have grown up with people hailing the movie as a classic but really, come on, the movie is very poor. To beging with none of the concepts are original, evolution and space travel were alredy ideas, all this movie is is putting it into visual form, and in a very poor manner. It is a very empty movie, i feel that if people want good science-fiction watch starwars, if you want to learn about evolution, read darwins book, and if you are into space travel, well.. there is a alot of better documentations on space travel out there. The problem i raise about this movie is that in all three catagories it can be beat out! So why watch this movie which does a poor job of explaining all three! Don't just like it because people call it a classic, its really not that great"
2,Lethargic and Weird,"I waited 15 days after the year 2001 was over before finally seeing this movie. The only really charming scene in it was a father's video conference with his daughter, who was about to celebrate her birthday.The imagery was rather bland when it wasn't alienating (no pun intended), and while the film provided a great showcase for music by the Strausses, I had trouble staying awake during most of it. I would have preferred more dialogue from the characters as well.Generally, it's a fine film to watch for those who have trouble getting to sleep."
5,Beautiful...,"After reading all of the other reviews, I'm not sure if i have a very good television set, or a very bad pair of eyes. I just watched this DVD again, and must say that i found it to be a very good quality reproduction, i did not notice any flickers or ghosts, and the sound quality was excellent. I think it is a good buy, but rent it first, just in case..."
3,"Classic movie, disappointing transfer","The movie is great. Enough said.The DVD is good, but not as good as I had hoped. The sound is clean, but old sound is rarely good sound in modern sound systems. The video transfer is good, but I suspect the source material wasn't pristine since there is both graininess and some spotting. But it's probably the best transfer and picture you can buy for this classic (until a digital high-definition transfer and video replay equipment), so how can we legitmately complain?Too bad Amazon does not have separate ratings for technical quality and movie quality -- geek that I am, I'd like to see these categories separately. Widescreen Review (magazine) also rates sound and picture separately."
2,Quick Clip: Classic film...incredibly poor rendering on dvd.,"""2001"" is one of those relatively rare movies that are so memorable for many movie-goers, that they are able to vividly recall the occasion of their first viewing. Unfortunately, MGM's recent release of the DVD version of this film serves only to make one long for another actual theatrical experience (in Cinerama?), rather than the visually distorted and audibly unsatisfying rendering of the disc. Although the movie is still spectacular and amazingly prophetic in its vision of our ""future"" in space (and the included ""short subject"" of author Clark's comments is enlightening), I recommend that fans rent, rather than purchase, this offering on DVD."
3,Graduate College Student,"I purchased this movie because it is supposedly one of the greatest American Films ever made and I enjoyed the book immensely. The movie itself was visually stunning and the direction of Kubrick was great. I found the storyline lacking from what the novel presented, however. The movie would not have made much sense if I had not read the book. That's why I only rated it three stars."
3,lousy sound,The video was great and movie still fun to watch. I was disappointed that sound did not match quality of picture. No surround sound as far as I could figure out.
2,Not a family film,"This movie has special effects ahead of it's time. The story, however, is difficult to follow. I wouldn't recommend it for children or for adults who don't want to really concentrate on the movie! I watched it in a room full of people and by the end 2/3 of the people didn't have a clue what was going on!"
2,"Just as dull and boring as ""The Shining"".","But it's a little bit better. That's not saying much though. Just as he did with ""The Shining"", director Stanley Kubrick tests the audiences' patience here with agonizingly slow pacing, little to no story or character development, and dull visual details. The one interesting thing in this movie is the HAL 9000 computer. He is one of the great screen villians of all time, and the AFI honored him as such recently. His character and the classical music on the soundtrack are just about the only things I like about this movie."
2,superb nonsense!,There's a saying: great expectation brings greaterdisappointment-- and this is it (although I have high respect forKubrick's directorial talent). This movie may entertain the lessanalytical audience.
3,True Film - Impossible at Home,"2001 is one of the few, perhaps the only film that is a true artwork, impossible to conceive of in any other medium or time. Star Trek is for gearheads and Star Wars for fantasy freaks. 2001 is for true dreamers, those who feel the connection to everything.Alas, you will never know 2001 from within the safety of your home. It can only be experienced within a large, darkened movie theater where the final sequence surrounds you and bears you away. Why bother with anything else? Go into the mountains instead, and look up at the stars.Or come to San Francisco where 2001 is being re-released this winter!"
4,Fine cinema,"This is a remarkable film, although you will need to be somewhat patient. The big baby in the sky ending, however, still confuses me."
5,Second greatest film ever made?,"Everybody pretty much agrees that ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest film ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a good contender for second place... but only because it was made many years after ""Citizen Kane."" ""2001"" is a very unconventional film that defies the basic concept of movie ""entertainment."" This isn't a ""movie,"" it is a visual symphony on celluloid, a type of filmic sculpture where the artist doesn't use a chisel and hammer, but a camera lens and a microphone (and a host of other tools and special effects). No, 2001 isn't a ""movie,"" its an ""environment,"" and has be experienced as such to be fully appreciated."
1,Terrible!,"This has to be the most BORING movie of all time. And I've watched a lot of movies. Yes, the special effects were amazing- especially for the time it was made. But oh my gosh!! The whole movie moves soooo slowly!! I thought I was going to go crazy! Luckily I had the ability to fast-forward. I really pity those who sat through the whole thing in a theater. I really thought I was going to go out of my mind.I suppose it's because in 2007, we're so accustomed to a lot of fast-paced and action-packed movies. So we find it very difficult to appreciate slow-paced movies. It requires a great deal of patience. I don't have that kind of patience. In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time. There is virtually no plot! And the little plot there is, doesn't make any sense! It just leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. Who enjoys that? Not me."
1,Warning: This review is a Spoiler,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute. This is the legendary movie I heard about? Wrong! Here come the spoilers all.In the beginning, the plot is relatively okay. Scientists want to discover how man begins. Okay, I get that. But as this movie progresses, it gets SLOWER AND SLOWER AND EVEN MORE BOOORING!!! Finally the end comes after 2 long hours of boring. Sociopathic computer is shut down. What happens next? Does astronaut go back to Earth? NO! he finds a big black monoloth thing and goes through a half an hour color scene. Then he is old. Then he is older, then he's older, then he's a baby. Thats about it.Recommended? Yeah, if your STONED you might like this movie. You would have to be REALLY stoned to understand it. Do not buy this movie, you will not like it."
1,Boring,"""2001"" is the most boring SF film of all time. If it had been edited to a 15 minute film, including the docking of the Earth-to-space ship with the artificial satelite (the best scene) it would still be too long. In addition to which, I always have felt that it expressed a real dislike of humanity. Why this is still considered a ""classic"" I will never understand. And, the special effects have always been terrible. Also, to call the acting ""wooden"" is kind."
5,Classic goodness,It's a classic movie. What can I say? It's a great deal at just a few dollars so you can't go wrong.
4,A very good movie,"This is a really good movie, but probably will not be entertaining for everyone. It touches on many different topics including the origin of life, artificial intelligence and space exploration. There is not really any action in the movie. The closest thing to that is when Dave was trying to get back into the ship after HAL locked him out. It is very much a movie that required you to think more than anything else. The idea that a computer goes bad and attacks humans is one that would appear later in movies like The Terminator, but what made this version of that story work was how HAL interacted with the other characters. The movie looks about as good as it possibly can on Blu Ray. Given how old it is, it will not look as good as newer movies do. It does have some, but not a ton of extras. If you are a fan of the movie, and do not own the DVD release this is worth getting."
3,"Good, Not Great","2001: A Space Odyssey has been hailed as a masterpiece. I'm not denying the cultural significance of the film. It's a story of evolution, told with Kubrick's distinct vision. However, at a whopping 141 minutes, and with very little dialogue - I found this movie difficult to watch. At times is bordered on pretentious with the grandiose ideas it was touching upon. It's likely to polarize viewers. Hardcore science fiction fans should really enjoy this film, but it may be lost on the casual viewer. Unfortunately I fell into the latter category."
4,H.A.L. would be proud,"Having seen this film countless times on screen and video, I can safely say that this is by far as good as it gets. The picture quality is outstanding in terms of both clarity and color reproduction. In fact, it almost appears that in some cases there has been some color enhancement, especially in the first chapter, ""The Dawn of Man"". The sound is good, but could be better. All in all, this is a very fine disc."
2,So boring you should show it to your kids at bedtime!,I watched about 90 minutes of the begining of this movie and another 20 min of the end. Parts of it are interesting but each adn every scene drags on about 10 times longer than it should. There is no great plot for people to think about and the mysterious monolith is just something Kubrick put in to confuse you. This is nothing like the masterful Clockwork Orange. (the only other Kubrick movie i've seen) The only saving grace is a beautiful music score.Don't bother with this unless you have a sleeping disorder.
1,I Waited Forever to See This Movie . . .,". . .AND BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED! I watched it twice (a total waste of time) and still could'nt find a stinkin' point to the movie! I know I am not supposed to badmouth the work of a recently deceased movie maker, but I really hated it. I've seen a lot of artsy-fartsy movies, but this is the limit."
1,Not so special effects,"The special effects may have amazed audiences 30+ years ago, but modern viewers will wonder what happened to the plot. Dare I say it, the book was much better!Here is my recipe for film genius status. Make a boring, pointless and unintelligible movie. Pretend that it is a great work of art. Hint that anybody who doesn't appreciate it isn't intelligent enough to understand it. Watch pretentious film critics fall all over themselves to praise your movie."
1,I don't understand why people like this movie at all,"I don't understand why people like this movie at all! I saw the movie because of the recent death of Kubrick. I was with great expectation. However, I was totally disappointed. I only saw it for the first 30 minutes because it is so boring and slow. If it is not Kubrick, I would stop at the first 15 minutes. For the first 30 minutes, there were hardly any dialogue at all, just music. I have difficulties to keep my attention focusing."
1,I'm only giving it 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars,"I am a huge follower of science-fiction film and writing and watching this movie was a complete waste of my time. When it was over I felt dissatisfied and confused.My husband and I felt let down by all those who have praised this film as a classic. We ended up fast-forwarding through much of the non-dialogue (which is quite a bit of the film).If you are purely interested in film effects, you will like this movie.If you are a fan of classical music, you will like this rather long and drawn out ""music video.""If, however, you want an engaging story, a comprehensible plot, or a compelling drama you will not find it in 2001: A Space Odyssey."
1,I fell asleep!,"Man, was this movie boring! I fell asleep at least 3 or 4 times. Stanley...take my advice...make some action movies, please!"
1,Somewhere beetween hypnotic and immensly boring,"Now this film is like Opera and Ballet. No one really really likes it but a whole bunch of people say they do to be cultural. This film is the Opera of the film world. 2 hours of pure boredom, Unfathomable symbolism. Fine it may have special effects but come one. Where's the excitement. Where's anything for that matter.Tripe and unless you want to impress someone very intelectual don't get it."
1,Ugh! The most overrated movie ever!,"This movie was referred to in pre-production as the ""proverbial good science fiction film"". However, if you want to see a movie that actually lives up to that description, try Star Wars or Forbidden Planet. Even after reading the book, I still had no idea what was going on. Nothing was explained, and there was basically no plot at all. Plus, it has one of the most ironic things I have ever seen in a movie. The part where the computer goes crazy, by far the most interesting segment, has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film! I have no idea what the filmakers were thinking when they came up with this idea. I like movies that make you think, but I don't like having to carefully analyze every single scene to get even a vague idea of what I have just seen. If you're looking for a good Kubrick movie, check out Dr. Strangelove and stay away from this garbage at all costs!"
2,whats the big deal?,what is the big deal with this movie? it just rambles on with extreamly annoying high pitched sound and bright lights in on part of it all you can see for about 4 minutes is colours it is extreamly annoying
2,Missing Special sceens,"Just watching section 3 when the space stewardess is suppost to wall upside down, They cut the sceen out. What the heck are they doing! I wonder how many more sceens are chopped out!!!!!"
5,How man interacts with technology through the ages,"Books have been written about what this movie is about, but for myself, one theme that gets short shrift is how man interacts with technology.We first see man controlling technology (with a little alien help, of course) and using it to control his world.Then we see technology controlling man. This is by no means a comedic film, but one very subtly funny moment involves Dr. Floyd studying the instructions to use the ""zero-gravity"" toilet on the moon shuttle...complete with 10 separate steps and hundreds of words of text.The rest of the allusions to how technology controls our lives are obvious, such as HAL's rebellion against Discovery's crew.Incredible film, with something new to learn every time you watch it."
1,"Great Movie, Lousy DVD","This film is outstanding. It is my favorite film of all time.However, this DVD is terrible. There are two shades of black bars for the letterboxing, one just a very dark green, one true black. It looks like they've copied it from some intermediate source that did it's own letterboxing, and did it badly.One scene actually has a hair or some similar debris crossing the screen.All in all, this is a lousy DVD transfer, and a very disappointing treatment of an excellent film. If you have a VHS copy, including a copy taped off of television, don't bother with the DVD. It has no advantage over the copy you already have."
4,2001: A Space Odyssey - Special Edition,"2001 is the best known novel by my favorite author Arthur C Clarke. The movie adds visuals & sounds not possible via 2001 book alone. People either love or hate this movie. There is no in-between. If you liked the book, then this is a must-see. If you like science (rather than gore) fiction and/or complex stores that leave plenty of room for interpretation, then this DVD is for you. On the other hand, if you prefer things spelled out clearly or huge man-eating sword-swinging aliens -- you will not like this at all. The book should be read first to get the most enjoyment. As for the bonus content: I was hoping for some outtake footage, but instead we get a couple hours of clips, interviews, analysis of the scientific predictions, behind-the-scenes production stuff, archival footage of Clarke, special effects discussions, review of Kubrick's career, and an audio-only Kubrick Interview from 11/66)."
5,STUNNING BLU RAY IS A MUST HAVE,"A post modern cultural phenomenon. 2001 is a genre defining, trailblazing classic that changed cinema and influenced an entire generation of great filmmakers including Lucas & Spielberg. And this brilliant Blu-Ray transfer will turn you into a HD philistine. A magnificent presentation of one of cinemas all time great movies."
5,Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece that still lives today...,"I'll admit it: 2001 is perhaps one of the slowest movies in history, moving at the pace of a tortoise the entire way through. However it is also one of the most ingenious, original, and simply breathtaking films ever to grace the big screen. Stanley Kubrick knew he was making something special when he made this movie, and the only way to truly experience this sweeping view of life in the future is on the big screen. Unfortunately, it is a rare event to be able to see this movie in the theatre, but at least DVD is the second best thing. 2001 looks great on DVD and sounds even better. Amazingly this landmark film has managed to stand the test of time, and only seems dated with the hokey ape makeup at the beginning of the film. For all the film buffs out there though, you can't say that you are a true fan of Science Fiction until you've seen 2001:A Space Odyssey."
2,Great movie - poor transfer,"This was and remains one of the greatest movies made. Unfortunately, the transfer for this DVD is very disapointing. Images are blurred and colors are distorted. I hope a better product becomes available, but in the meanwhile be warned."
1,2001: A Space Odyssey,"This iconic, 5-star film has never been equaled, but the film transfer on this DVD is as poorly engineered as any DVD I have ever seen. Video compression artifacts abound, and the disc is a literal museum of DVD technology problems. Exposure errors litter the transfer, along with strange grids and patterns in high-contrast scenes, color smears, and false color modeling of objects (see the monolith in orbit around Jupiter). Save your money on this fancily-packaged product and buy an old-fashioned Criterion laserdisc if you want to see this movie as Kubrick intended (he personally approved the Criterion laserdisc transfer)."
3,"Masterpiece movie, terrible DVD image!","This review is just a warning about this DVD release: the image quality is terrible. Bad compression, awful color dithering (most noticed at the ending), and a lot of ""hey, that part of the screen is not moving!""... I put the DVD and VHS side by side (both the letterbox edition), and the VHS has a much smoother and perfect image, without pixelation and color gradient problems found in the DVD. I can't believe they released this MASTERPIECE in such a terrible DVD. If you are an image quality freak, avoid this release. If you are not, a must buy."
4,New DVD release MUCH higher quality than first one...,"If you have a widescreen home theater setup, then like me, you were probably very disappointed with the original DVD version of 2001 which wasn't anamorphic and had muffled sound.This new version looks a THOUSAND times better, and the sound is incredible, especially considering that the movie is 32 years old now.I only give it 4 stars because it doesn't have the Arthur C Clarke interview of the original DVD, nor any other materials.Now if they could just redo 2010, which looks like crap on a widescreen setup."
4,"2001, 2010, 2061, 3001 The whole picture.","Okay, so maybe the method that was used for the transfer of this movie wasn't the best you can get, maybe the original print wasn't the best they could use . . . I don't know what happened, but the movie is still good. But the DVD version is still a must see and the book must be read, and the other three books (which explains a lot) should be read. I think everybody's missing the fact that 2001, 2010, 2061 & 3001 (even though the books are not direct sequels of each other) are linked together, and give the entire picture."
2,Turner Wastes DVD Technology,"I was looking forward to seeing this film on DVD. However, in spite of having a good TV (Sony) and S cable connections, I was very disappointed with the quality of the DVD. I would agree with other reviewers remarking on the graininess of the video as well as other artifacts. Also, why have an essentially blank screen at the beginning and in the middle? Unlike a theatrical presentation, viewers at home can pause the film at any point in the film. Further, the ""interview"" with Mr. Clarke is really just a film of the studio press conference at the film's premiere. Shame on Turner for such a shoddy production."
2,"Beautiful, but boring (like many cute girls I've known)","Nothing much to say, Kubrick pretended to have something to say, but this movie was nothing but a bunch of nice looking garbage. He just crammed a bunch of things into this movie and kept it vague so people would be confused into thinking he was brilliant. It is I guess, people say this garbage is one of the best movies of all time.This stuff is getting me to wonder if A.I. was made slightly boring at parts in an attempt to emulate Kubrick. Speilberg is a better filmaker than that, now I'm starting to get it. This is the 1st movie I can remember seeing by Kubrick. If I've seen Dr. Strangelove I don't remember it."
1,2001: A Space Odyssey,"If you love special effects, then I recommend this movie. This is the slowest moving movie I have ever seen. The director stays on one thing too long so that it becomes frustrating to watch. I believe that it is not as thought provoking and intellectual as some people say it is. If you like intellectual science fiction movies with good special effects that are also exciting to watch and make you feel something other than boredom, then I highly recommend Planet of the Apes, AliensII, and ET, NOT 2001: A Space Odyssey."
2,BORING !!!!,"The beggining of the movie was great with the scene of our early ancestors, but from there it was the most boring movie I have ever seen. Very very dissapointed."
1,Just BORING,"Well this movies is supposed to be legendary, maybe you gotta see it in the theater and maybe you need to be really stoned to appreciate it. I have read the novel and I really enjoyed it, Stanley Kubrick just made this movie so so so so boring. It is the slowest movie I've ever seen. Read the book instead. I wanted to like the movie but just could not. The special effects and all that are amazing to this day though."
3,Two DVDs: One good -- one bad?,"Some people seem to be complaining about one of the DVD versions of ""2001"" -- so which one is it? Is it this full-screen version with the Space Wheel on the cover? They claim that one DVD version contains a poor quality film print in which the picture ""shakes"", the color is faded, and there are the ubiquitious white blips or smears appearing on the print. The other version [letterbox -- Collectors Edition] has an excellent picture, color, no major white blips. So, if you are looking for a good quality DVD version, it might be worth the few extra bucks to get the Collectors Edition -- letterbox -- with Keir Dullea in the space helmet on the cover."
3,"Great Film, Bad DVD","Since there is no way to properly sum up the greatness of experiencing this movie, I would like to point out how terrible the DVD version is:The video is grainy, shakes, and the resolution is unacceptable for a DVD. It reminds me of a rental VHS tape that has been played a few too many times. The trailers are presented with more care and respect. This is not at all a tribute to Stanley's work.The audio was digitally remastered which does add something to the experience. We can be thankful for that.Overall, I have to recommend the film because of the vision and philosophy it contains, but the anniversary edition on VHS looks much better. This is a movie that is very much dependent on the visuals to understand what is happening. The DVD version fails in this regard."
3,Better than regular DVD but not as good a picture as it should be,Resolution is great of course but image quality was not up to what a BlueRay image should be. Overall a great way to see 2001 but did not measure up to my expectations in visual quality.
2,I can't make any sense out of it.,"'2001: A Space Odyssey' has some brilliant sequences along with some of the most uninteresting characters and lame dialogue I've ever seen and heard. This is the only film I've ever seen where the machine is more interesting than any of the human characters. It is a visual treat to watch from beginning to end, but the film doesn't make any sense. Certain scenes are so boring you might as well watch a real-life space launch. It could be more informative and rewarding than watching certain parts of this movie. People have tried to debate the meaning behind behind this borefest. They don't realize that Kubrick made the ending confusing on purpose so people could go around trying to analyze it. They don't realize that Kubrick wanted a lot people seeing this movie. There is no deep meaning behind it. Kubrick just wanted to make extra bucks from people renting, buying, and seeing his movie in the theatres."
3,"Classic movie, but lousy premiere in DVD!","I can't believe MGM would release this phenomenal movie in such a poor quality DVD. There are several laserdisc versions of varying quality, but they're all better than this. Don't buy it--hold out for a better quality DVD version!"
3,I'm not sure what this is supposed to be...,"I'm sorry but this movie is boring. If you get your kicks from watching a 5 minute clip of an astronaut change out a component on a communications dish, you will really enjoy this movie. For the other 99.995% of the population, it is flat out boring."
1,"Good DVD quality, Bad movie!","The picture and the sound effect of the movie is great. the story itself *****, much worse than I expected."
1,An audio-visual assault,"I know that as a film student, it's my duty to like this movie, but I'm sorry. I just can't. I saw it in a theatrical setting (ie. hard chairs, full-blast surround sound, large screen, but only one bathroom break) and it was easily the most miserable 3+ hours of my life to date. Sorry, but I resent any movie that leaves me with a headache and sick stomach."
1,Great movie - lousy mastering job,This disc is not worth owning because of the poor image digitalization. The images are fuzzy and full of little flickering artifacts that make the movie unmatchable on any large screen TV. Don't buy it! I loved 2001 as a kid... I love 2001 as a movie now... but I hate this DVD.
4,2001/DVD A Space Odyssey,"This is an older movie but one that I wanted in my colection, I also have the second one 2010"
5,"Space, the Final Frontier","In space, no one can hear you scream. This movie is a jam-packed circus party of apes, aliens and super computers. It's like a buddy-picture set on the high seas, except that it is in deep space rather than the high seas. A classic of genre, this movie will be with us well itno 2001."
4,Fantastic... but few DVD features,"Beautifully remastered with incredible sound, but I was a bit disappointed that there weren't any behind-the-scenes featurettes. They could have included interviews with Kubrick or Clarke and maybe explored the impact of the film on sci-fi and filmmaking. This is a great gift for Kubrick and sci-fi fans, but it could have been even greater with those featurettes."
5,A short poem....,Through struggling dream of intuitionMan has seeked to encompass the final frontierBut Kubrick doesn't allow simplistic termsHe lets the our minds attain leverage to steerWhat lies beyond our confining realmPerhaps little will abide to careThen it would be a waste of imaginationLook another monolith over there!
5,One of the best stories ever put on film.......,"and definitely not for brainless pricks. I have read many ignorant,amateurish customer reviews of this film. The people who write those type of reviews obviously have the brain of a five year old. Anyway,there's nothing much I can say about this spellbinding film that other reviewers haven't already said."
4,Good I guess.,"For me, the best part of the entire film is the first twenty minutes that feature the dumb apes fighting over water. After that, it felt way too slow for me even though I knew it was made back in the 60's. Anyways, it's worth watching once so give it a go."
3,"OK, but not my style.","The price and service were fine. The movie was a bit unusual...not my preferred type of movie, but it was OK."
3,Essence without structure,"The problem with this movie is that it gives you the essence of Clarke's works without the structure. The structure matters because the natural world does have rules at an observable level. Even modern physics doesn't validate magic as some would think. This doesn't mean the rules are absolute, but they matter. Maybe the structure was there & I just missed it. If so it's a great movie."
3,Quick-Buck artists ruin a classic.,"The video detail and special effects are great. The aspect ratio is good, but the sound track has been trashed. No bass, garbled treble and a dolby 5.1 remastering that sounds as if it was recorded off a small radio in another room. The producers of this remake should be ashamed. The original sound track would blow you away. I was very dissapointed to say the least. What a waste! I wish I could talk to their sound people."
1,Waste of Time,I bought this movie reading reviews of top blu-ray movies to buy and it was the worst mistake of my life. Pros: the CONCEPT of man vs machine. Cons: Everything else. The first half of the movie I watched a bunch of apes (dawn of men) jump around and scream at each other. The 2nd half was watching toy spaceships / people slooooooooowly scroll across the screen. I actually started to watch the movie in 1.5x speed because of that crap. It was the most boring movie I have ever seen. This movie could have been literally 15 minutes long and could have got across the same points. The cover of this dvd is the coolest looking part of the movie.
1,Blah,"This movie is so ridiculously deep and so damn complicated that it's just not even worth watching. When I watch a movie, I want to be entertained, I don't want to have to sit and watch the thing over and over to try and figure out the meaning."
1,Very Bad Movie,2001: A Space Odyssey is the worst movie that I have ever seen. It is two and a half hours long and there is only a half hour of talking in the middle of it. The rest of the movie is lame visual affects and weird sounds. The first half hour of the movie is just a bunch of apes leaping about and screaming because of the monolith.
5,Great,"I am sure by now no one needs a movie review of this classic.It's so wonderful, with great acting."
4,HD refrence disc,"The only reason I did not give this a five star review is because I am not a huge fan of the movie. I must say, though, if you want something to show off your HD set, and to show just how good a 40 year old movie can look, this is it. The movie looks like it could have been shot yesterday using HD cameras. No film grain, colors are vibrant, blacks are true, edges are sharp and well defined, and background details really pop out of the screen. The sound is excellent for a film of this age, and will not disappoint. The sound field is rich, using all channels. Its not agressive surround, but it does make you feel immersed. The subwoofer channel is quite aggressive in some areas - really impressive for a movie this age.This disc is a must have for any HD enthusiast."
4,I feel very sorry for HAL9000...,"This story tells me the meaning of killing human. I love HAL and don't like ""that baby"", because the baby know nothing but killing perfecter who know everything. After all ""human"" kills HAL, who is rather kind, and smart. 3 people killed by HAL means a power of that we have to let us be. HAL was a symbol of God and the best.While It's a little educational story, which say ""human"" must be modest in deeper space.HOWEVER, there's something indescribably appealing on that!"
2,Still don't know...,I've watched this movie thre times and I still don't understand what is going on in the second half of the movie. Because of this I have no desire to read the book. I gave it two stars because of the second half of the movie.
2,A classic but boring,"More than 25 years later, I watched the movie once more and again I could not totally understand. Futhermore, my wife and my daughter found the movie so boring that I had to watch alone the last two hours part. The movie lasts 148 minutes but it is too slow that the message could be given in 1/2 even 1/3 time of the total duration. Anyway, I just watched for ""nostalgie"". Will I do this again? I don't know, if I ever have to start re-viewing my DVD collection, ""2001 Space Odyssey"" may take place in last three items."
1,A VERY BORING MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH.,I found 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY totally boring and a complete waste of time I even fell asleep during the movie. The whole storyline is completly dull I won't give it away just watch and see what I mean. My advice I'm sorry to say is to skip it.
1,"Dull, Plotless Nonsense","This film is not art nor a great cinimatic achievment. It has no story, dialogue, or acting. This does not deserve much recognition, and it's surprising that it's gotten what it has.It's a bore."
1,2001 deserves better,"Take a look at L.A. Confidential, Boogie Nights, and Starship Troopers and then look at the crummy treatment that this glorious movie receives from MGM. Most unfortunate is a missing line of dialogue from the Dave/Hal confrontation at the end. Don't buy this disc and demand that MGM release a re-master. END"
1,DVD - mixed bag,"I really don't see how this transfer is any better than the previous DVD, which has some well-documented screw-ups in it. But picture quality? I just watched the two versions side by side and I saw trivial differences that fall within the variations you'd get changing TVs from one viewing to another. The commentary track is absolutely trite: self-admiring thespians who can't get out of the way, or voice an uncliched idea about film or metaphysics to save their life. The 2nd disc is OK, but most of it comes off as the mediocre thoughs of a lot of mediocre hangers-on who didn't get the profundity of the movie then, and only want to talk about technical conceits they're associated with. And that includes Arthur C Clarke!"
5,"This movie is, ""Something Wonderful""","An outstanding work. In all my life, I've never seen anything so mind boggling and brilliant. Every second of this movie was exceptional. Stanley Kubrick is a great director. Truly a movie that that has stood the test of time. The DVD has taken the movie to another level with its exceptional sound and picture quality. Well worth every penny. If you're questioning yourself about picking this movie up, please do yourself a favor and purchase it. If you do, I believe you will be very pleased. The sequel is not that bad either."
4,"Classic sci-if at its best,","Stanley's masterpiece is a work of art.This tale fuses art with science fiction with what was at that time state of the art special effects.An A. I. computer named HAL malfunctions while on a journey to Jupiter, causing a series of problems for the crew.The movie ends with one crew members time-space mind trip never before shown in the cinemas."
4,Great Movie!,Even though this is an older sci fi movie it still a good watch. My husband & I watched it again the other night and it was very entertaining.
5,A Visual Delight!!!,"The sets, lights and almost everything about the movie seemed to have been meticulously (and intelligently) planned and executed to create a modern-day masterpiece! Akin to watching a series of paintings by Dutch and Italian masters."
3,Odyssey Indeed,"Yes, I bought a VHS copy of this movie. Why not? Lots of silence, lots of colors... seems like a great movie to drop acid to."
2,Another movie that hasn't aged well,Although I love some sci-fi like Gattaca & 5th element - this movie seemed boring and dragged out in comparison. Classics like this & Blade Runner I just don't get - they might have been top notch back in time - but watching it today just doesn't cut it.
2,What's the fuss?,"I remember a visit to the National Museum in Washington when I saw several people standing in front of a blue canvas debating it's meaning. Of course the conceit of modern ""art"" is if you don't get it you're somehow retarded. I'm no scientist, but I did earn a BA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a 3.3 GPA and a focus on Liberal Arts. As far as 2001 goes, there are few interesting ideas, that unfotunately are stretched to the limit, and it is technially proficient, but honestly I have considerable concern for the particular type of audience that views this as some sort of masterpiece. Have they ever kissed a girl? It may come as a surprise that this film was almost universally panned on its initial release, which was of course spot on, until drug addicts started to see it in droves while high. It' not quite much ado about nothing, but it's pretty close."
2,Oh dear!,"Never thought this classic would date - but it has! Long meaningful pauses in the plot. Special effects no longer so mind-blowing. Arthur C Clarke's original novel ""Sentinal"" is much more thought-provoking piece of entertainment."
1,Don't miss the epic excitement of the FBI copyright warning,"If you are looking for entertainment from this movie, you have looked in the wrong place. In a two hour movie there is maybe 10 minutes of action and 10 minutes of dialogue. You will be riveted to your seat by the dull corporate meeting. Watch the 15 minute display of colors as the astronaut lands on Jupiter. Listen as the background orchestra plays every of music it can find--just killing time, I suppose--until the actors decide to mumble some pointless line again. You will love the old couple singing ""Happy Birthday"" to their son. It's brainless works like this that send me back to '50's and '60's era movies when writer had creativity and a grip on life."
1,Rudolph Hates A Flawed DVD!,"RUDOLPH HATES THIS!! HD DVD in New HD DVD Player, played fine up to 1/3rd of movie. Then the picture broke and froze and would not continue."
1,Boring,"Space views are spectacular but not enough of them. Conversations ins1de the capsule are boring,"
1,worse movie ever,how can people talk about how great this movie is beyond special effects it sucks its probably one of the worst movies ever. I don't understand half the movie and in order to understand even half of it you have to watch 2010 you'd have to be high to like this movie or very stupid fittingly my roomate liked it because he is both maybe thats the reason I don't understand this movie because i'm not some stupid stoner man this movie is horrible and if i was a POW and someone made me watch this movie as toucher i'd tell them anything cause this movie is tourture the only thing good about it is the special effects and that song The Blue Danube thats it don't waste your time or money unless you run a POW camp then you'd probably like this movie remember jsut guard your eyes or your tourchering yourself to man this movie sucks
5,Inspirational,"I found this movie to be awe-inspiring. The images took my breath away, especially the gape-worthy stargate scene. I'm one of those kids who wasn't born when it was released so I was hoping that there would be 30th anniversary rerelease last year. They could do ""Star Wars"", they could do ""Grease"", they could do ""The Big Chill"" and ""Dirty Dancing"", but they couldn't do this? Horrors!"
2,"poor color, ghosts around objects, many screen artifacts",Very poor technical conversion to dvd. Lacks all of the power of the origional movie.
4,It's a classic,"It's a classic movie that everyone should have in theirs collections. The movie was optimized, so the quality is almost as good as a recent movie film in HD"
4,This is the version to get,"The additional features include a commentary tract with the 2 principal stars that finally answered a lot of questions. This is a beautiful film and has not aged at all. In fact, it looks as good now as it did in the 60's."
5,CLASSIC,"THEE original space classic. The monolith, the apes, the songs and HAL! Not for the younger crowd I noticed but to anyone who saw it when it came out, it'll bring back those good old sci fi times."
5,"Better than the DVD, just as good from the theater.","I would highly recommend getting this movie in Blu-ray. I have both the DVD and the Blu-ray, and after watching the Blu-ray and then comparing it to the DVD - you can tell a big differance. This movie over all is a classic, it's one of Stanley Bubrick first movies and one of his best next to Full Metal Jacket. I am kind of appalled by some of the 1 stars from people who say that this movie sucks - they may be young guys who have grown up with movies with CGI and other films with better special effect but you have to understand that this movie was made in 1967 also. I love this movie and it's a great film and I would recomend this to anyone who has seen this movie and has a blu-ray."
3,"Phenomenal movie, but sub-standard DVD mastering","Without a doubt, this is the most realistic sci-fi movie ever. I believe it comes close to capturing what space exploration could feasibly be like in the future. The cinematography is spectacular--Kubrick had major talent here. MGM should have treated this movie like royalty, and produced a brilliantly mastered DVD. Unfortunately, it appears MGM put a low priority on quality, and the DVD came out sub-standard. One can only hope they'll take seriously all of the negative feedback and produce a high quality DVD in time for the year 2001."
5,The Best Movie of All Time,"This was a movie that not only made you think, but also gave you space to expand your ideas without being bound to what one person believes. It was directed with great respect to science and was both an inspiration and an intellectually stimulating feature."
1,Wait for a widescreen version,"I love this move! I love it! And I was thrilled to death to see it on DVD. And MAN was I disappointed. It looks like a digitized version of a standard videotape. It still has all the artifacts of video such as contrast lines and color that is not up to the snuff of DVD. DVD can handle a much better much clearer picture than this seemingly quickly done version of this beautiful film. While the DVD does look better than videotape only by comparison, it just does not look good enough to warrant a purchase in my opinion. I cannot imagine this DVD being the DVD I watch the movie on in 5 or 10 years. Someone is going to have to come out with a remastered widescreen anamorphic version with better compression, I'm hoping before the beginning of the new year. Have patience. This is not the DVD the film should be viewed on."
5,Darwin's first great achievement,"On the voyage of the Beagle--before he had ever seen a coral reef--Darwin had deduced an explanation of the geological processes that created them by applying Charles Lyell's explanation of uplift and subsidence. Accordingly, he posited that the Chilean coast had been rising while the ocean floor was subsiding. When he finally explored some barrier reefs, he knew that since the polyps could not live deeper than 120 feet, and all the coral below that was dead, the confirmation of the reefs' great depth was evidence of subsidence--a theory that has stood the test of time. This is an attractive and affordable edition of Darwin's treatise."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed because the product was said to be sold like new and it didn't say it had an inscription. The product has an inscription which then I couldn't give it as a gift. Other than that the book was in good condition.
2,Didn't do it for me,Not quite what I was expecting - struggled through 45 pages and then gave up... Maybe hubby will enjoy it more?
3,Challenging and Beautiful,"While <em>Beautiful Losers</em> is a fascinating read, it was not exactly a page turner for this reader. Yes, there are faults in my reading patterns, so I am sure that I should have gotten more from it, had I been able to concentrate fully... but this felt more like three hundred pages of poetry than it did a novel. Images were stunning, passages lyrical, images burned into my soul. Plot was convoluted and characters with only voice and little in the way of body filled the pages.After my first experience with the authorship of Cohen, I will be sure to scour the used book store racks for more. I will buy them and hold them, and be ready to absorb myself in them fully before I take on the task of another of his books.I like the challenge of books like this, but all readers should be ready to tackle the intricacies of Cohen before cracking one of his books. I'll be better prepared next time, I hope."
2,"I Love This Guy, but He Really Should Stick to Music","I bought this book out of reverence for the man who wrote Bird on a Wire and so much other incredible, passionate music. It is a valiant attempt in the style of Jack Keroauc or Don DiLillo, but without the command of the genre or the ability to conjure and sustain images and moods of a truly accomplished fiction writer. I would suggest you buy a copy of Dharma Bums and listen to Cohen on the stereo while you read...and Leonard, I love you man, but I love you much better when you are singing."
1,YUCK!!!!,"I had to read this book for a university course onCanadian novels, so I couldn't throw it away or burn it as I would have liked to do. It is without a doubt the most painful and difficult book I've ever had to read. It is without question Cohen is a master at what he does--not just anyone could leave such a lasting distate in my mouth more than six years after I read the book! However, the subject matter, the style, the imagery, and especially the various kinds of loveless sex...everything seems to feel terribly sick and twisted, and the overall impression the book leaves is one of profound and lasting oppression."
5,An exercise book in self-appropriation.,"Cohen operates in many guises, balancing notions of beauty and brutal testimony like a clown racing to earth to his death. Beautiful Losers is a book that best illustrates this, in the worlds of discovery and recovery, where the author's imaginative surges do not discriminate. That is, his book demonstrates a courage whereby the writer fights to stay open eyed depite the object or direction of his consciousness.Similarily as a reader, I believe that such effort is required if the full impact of the book is to be experienced. Close the book, and you effectively demonstrate the central notion. Burn the book, and the inner embers of your life will choke you, before distroying you.Yet if you stick with the book, and endure its crudities, focusing upon the the strange journeys the characters make in their private lives... one might just overcome becoming a beautiful loser."
5,Wonderful and beautiful poetry,"To illustrate the wonder and beauty of Cohen's poetic prose I include a quote:""Edith Edith Edith long things forever Edith Edie cuntie Edith where your little Edith Edith Edith Edith Edith stretchy on E E E octopus complexion purse Edith lips lips area thy panties Edit Edith Edith Edith knew you your wet rivulets Eeeeddddiiiittthhhh yug yug sniffle truffle deep bulb bud button sweet soup pea spit rub hood rubber knob girl come head bup bup one bloom pug pig yum one tip tongue lug from end of bed of lips multiple lost sunk gone rise girl head small come knob splash sunk lostlick search nose help wobble hard once more lurk up girl knob bob bubble sunk in normal skin folds lab drowned lady labia up up appear pea bean...""and on and on.If that doesn't speak to you of the majesty and hopelessness of the human condition, I don't know what will."
1,Brave exploration,"The language in Beautiful Losers may not be as prolifically dirty as it might first appear and once again we bow our heads to James Joyce but only for a second as we attempt to mould something else that we hope will survive.Difficult to describe why Beautiful Losers is an essential read because it's difficult to analyse poetic prose. Cohen bravely wrote of love, relationships and sex without apparent blushes and restrictions so come and take a peek, open your flowers."
2,this is hard to write... but not as hard to read as this book,"I ordered this and The Favorite Game, taking advantage of Amazons buy two and get a deal policy.I didn't like this book at all. It doesn't feel as natural as Favorite Game, it doesn't flow like FG and doesn't delieve like FG.I don't know what Mister Cohen was trying to accomplish... James Joyce or Henry Miller lost generation of Montreal?The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is solely on my adoration of the author."
1,The absolute worst book I have ever read!,"This book could not have been worse. Not if a concerted effort had been made to make this some kind of intellectual exercise in jibberish. I have never wasted more time absorbing the absolute random thoughts of an author than on this book. There are pages of just random words, one with no more connection to the next.For these other fools raving about this book must either be misguided patriotism or vain attempts at psuedo-intellectualism. If you are reading this review - please save yourself the $10 bucks and read something else.I read dozens of books every year and have been doing so for 20+ years and I can never remember reading a worse book. The sheer futility of reading this book was similar to the feelings you experience right after you realize you have been ripped off.Worst ever!"
2,not very good shape,"The book was rated as very good condition, but it was yellow and soiled and not very good in my opinion."
5,"The new -soon to be- bestseller: TC, Watch out!","There's a new force in the world, Conrad Peterson (Ninja), and a new force in the world of spy fiction thrillers, Alex LeFevre. Only his first novel, Alex LeFevre has already managed to combine the art of dramatic story telling with the grittiness of today's headlines. An excellent read from start to finish, this novel is only the first attempt by an author we are sure to hear more from in the future. Grab your copy today and be sure not to miss any of the action from this top-notch author and his NINJA!"
4,Tien An Men Square Rebellion,"....This story is really well written because it is from the view point of Alex so you get a lot of additional input, which puts it into better words because he too is a high school student. The only thing I had a problem with was because a great deal of the names people and places are Chinese, name get confusing and you start to mix them up. The relationship between Alex and Lau Xu is really unique because he finds out Lau Xu is a spy but still he really looks up to him and thinks of him of a friend. When he died Alex was just so hysterical he fell face first on the street a few times. This is a really good story to read for some good information on the infamous student rebellion and it is a lot of fun to read as well.I would really recommend this book to others because it is a really good story that gives you a first-rate point of view from some one who was there and lived through it."
5,Thought-provoking and fantastic!,"Both as a teacher and as a literary critic, I rate this book at 5 stars! Thought-provoking and wonderfully insightful, the reader shares a horrific experiece with Alex and watches him come to the realization of what war, conflict, revolution, and death really mean."
4,The Best book a teacher made you read.,"When I frist started to read Forbidden City, It didn't seem that all interesting. It seemed lame and slow. But since we had to read it, I read ahead. I ended up finishing the book when the rest of the class was on pg. 60. The book really develops and is a great way to show teenagers what happened then, since it's through the eyes of a teen. You should definietly read this book, I have, and liked it a lot."
4,what to Exspect,"well the story I read, I thought was great. This book is called Forbidden City.This book is about these two people that is going to film an event. well two of the character named Alexander Jackson and his dad goes to Beijing to do a report on the event. His dad does this and is risking his life as well as his son. Alex was a history freak, he collected soldiers in his basement.well they traveled to where they were going and it didn't turn out the way they expected. When they got there it was ok until the event was going on. They took out tanks and killed people. While this happened alex witness his chinese friend's death. well through this event he recorded it and when it was over his father didn't know his son recorded it. Well one month after the incident chen xi tong the mayor of Beijing submitted his report to the politburo of the communist party of china."
1,Typical Textbook Novel,"This book had lots of promise. It could have been really interesting. Unfortunately, the author saw fit to explain things, such as the Chinese government, through pages of dialogue from a history book. Alex, though 17, has no clue of the opression in China, and I found that unrealistic, even in 1989. I also thought the part about his friends calling him ""Shan Dah"" was ridiculous. I didn't like this book because I didn't care about Alex."
3,Deja Vu All Over Again,"John Mayall ran out of meaningful lyrics about album number twenty. He ran out of original melodies shortly thereafter. He keeps plugging away, similar songs, trite lyrics, and the only thing that saves any of these albums are the great guest and session musicians who put their own spin on the similar melodies and pull Mayall's bacon out of the fire.Don't get me wrong, I love John Mayall's music, particularly the early stuff, before he became predictable and boring.This actually would be a good CD for those people who would like an intro to Mayall or do not have a lot of Mayall CDs.For some of us who buy most of Mayall's CDs hoping that somehow, someway, he will recapture the magic he had on Blues from Laurel Canyon, Hard Road, Bare Wires, Movin' On, USA Union, Bluesbreakers w. Clapton and Jazz-Blues Fusion, this CD is the same old song, different album or deja vu all over again."
1,Mayall is in need for a wake up call,"Blues can be very boring like in this case. Don't get me wrong, I like blues and in fact I think John Mayall's ""Wake up call"" is more or less a masterpiece in this genre. But on this album, ""Padlock on the blues"", Mayall is making things too easy for himself - it's just the same song over and over again and I'm getting so bored. I tend to think that even Mayall got bored since this one clearly lack enthusiasm.The music on ""Padlock on the blues"" isn't much better than the average ""hobby-bluesband"" you and your co-workers might have formed. A must better buy is Gary Moore's ""Still got the blues"", or if you lean towards the more heavy side of the blues - Pat Travers' ""Blues tracks"" and Rick Derringer's ""Elctra blues""."
5,Great for Beginers or anyone else,"This book is VERY interesting, it contains useful information about the throwing knife and the tomahawk (like the proper way to throw). it also contains great storys about spesific knife-throwing exprts and their extreme throws (like the longest known throw which is AMAZING), this is the kind of books that you start reading and cant stop, and after that youll find yourself reading through it agian and again (the storys told here are great for making people look at you funny and ask ""how the hell do you know all this cool stuff?!?""). and with all that you will finaly understand how to throw the knife and make it stick! before i had the book i couldnt do it, but know i stick the knife more than miss it (btw the book also has info about making your own target board in your backyard)"
4,Guide for Grandson,Purchased as a gift for my Grandson who is learning to throw a tomahawk. It has a beautiful wood handle.
3,Vocalization,"As usual, the music of AATW was outstanding even though this album was remastered from quite a while ago. The fellow who did the vocals (also played guitar and drums), should sit down and listen to himself and see if he agrees with me that he should stick to guitar and drums and leave the singing to Benson or some other vocalist. This gentleman may well be the nicest person on earth, but I don't think he did AATW any favors by singing. Of course, this is my own opinion but I played rhythm guitar and sung country and swing music for 45 years, so I believe that my feelings about this album are justified."
4,kids probably would like it,"I am a teacher and bought this book at my school's book fair. I actually really liked the cover. That is what caught my eye. Anyway, this was a pretty good book. Fairly dark and gloomy--not an uplifting book by any means. But, the writing flowed and I found myself reading on. My daughter is into fantasy books, so I believe this book would appeal to kids who like that type of writing. There are worse books out there that try to appeal to kids."
1,Bummer,I thought I would get all 5 but only the one dark one came in the mail... Who else ordered this please tell me if it's the same with you!! I'm very mad
1,Wonderful eau de toilette turned to alcohol!,"I bought Ivoire De Balmain for years in department stores in NYC. Loved it, always got compliments and requests for what perfume I was wearing. Because I received gifts for several recent years of another wonderful perfume I had not purchased Ivoire. But I missed not being able to use it; but could not find it at any department store in NYC, including Bloomingdales. So I went to Amazon. What a shock to discover Ivoire was no longer but a ""shadow of its former self."""
4,Gets Better & Better,"This is one of those films that gets better with each viewing.Like others, at first I asked, ""What's the big deal?"" Well,I gave it another chance, this time with the English subtitles on. I discovered what all those whispers and taped conversations said and it made for a fascinating character study and eventually suspenseful film.It's the study of a paranoid loner who is suffering a guilty conscience over the work he has done over the years, and what tragic consequences could happen with the latest project he's involved with. Without giving anything away, the loner's fears are realized in a shocking ending, but not in the way he imagined.Gene Hackman, as always, does a super job of acting. He dominates the film as the main character, ""Harry Call."" The topic matter - high-tech surveillance - was intriguing, too. After watching this film, I wondered what kind of surveillance tools are available now, 35 years after this film was made."
5,Wow! If Only Suspense Was This Good!,"I am only 13 and when I saw this film it took my breath away. This is now one of my top 10 good films, It deserved something. The reason why this is a good movie is Gene Hackman he is exceptionally good in this film, he is good enough to win an Oscar. This also is the spawning point of many good actors, Teri Garr (Tootsie) and Harrison Ford (The Fugitive). Francis Ford Coppola is a master at Suspense and this movie is intresting as it sucks the viewer into the plot. The gadgets and gizmo's are brilliant in this movie and it's only 1974! FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA I THANK YOU FOR THIS MOVIE!"
3,Sleepy Little Horror Film,"When was the last time you saw a movie with Gene Hackman as the good guy and Harrison ford as the bad guy?Yeah, this little 70's screamer is disturbingly horrifying. Even more so when you realize that all the surveillance equipment showcased as state of the art is Little Tikes compared to what's available now!It's worth watching for that reason alone, if it weren't worth watching for the scenes of the youngest Harrison Ford you've EVER seen, and the brilliant keyboard artistry of David Shires in the background if I read my DVD jacket right.Cindy Williams is straight faced like you've never seen her, but the doozy of a plastic opaque overcoat that Hackman wears is almost as creepy as the entire movie."
2,The Conversation DVD Review,"Movie: Boring and unexciting, with Gene Hackman totally wasted. David Shire's score has no suspense and basically consists of a solo piano.DVD: The 1.85:1 picture is enhanced and of high quality."
1,Long & Dull,There are a few moments in this flick that are useful but overall it's lonnggg and dullllll; I would not recommend it for entertainment purposes.
1,Snooze......,"We loved ""Enemy of the State"" and this was recommended as the movie that led up to it. BORING! This movie is NOTHING like Enemy of the State, it was slow, predictable and a total sleeper. The only reason we watched to the end was that we were SURE it had to get better....it did not."
1,Disappointed,"Although I liked the story line, I thought Jean Hackman's promiscuity did not lend to the theme of the show. The fact that there was no resolution at the end beyond the murder, made it a little empty for me. It was so so, but not worth the time in my estimation."
5,A brilliant take off on Antonioni!,"Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow up"" is about a photographer not being able to understand wheather a murder had occured or not. Coppola's film is about the same, only here he is a surveilance guy, but in both films (as in De-Palma's ""Blow Out"", a stated take off on ""Blow Up"") the philosophical question rises: ""Can we count on our senses to help us grasp what's real and what's not?"". And out of all three mentioned pictures, Coppola's does it best."
2,Strange Film,"I had never heard of this film until I saw a preview on AMC. I rented the DVD and watched it expecting some great story after reading all the reviews. All I got out of it was that Harry was a paranoid nutjob. The ending was good. Harry found out his own apartment was ""bugged"", ripped it all apart to find nothing, never realizing that it was ""bugged"" by the same device he called ""junk"" at the wire tapper convention! It was right in front of him!UPDATE **INTERESTING FACT!**While watching Hackman in ""Enemy of the State"", he is asked by Wil Smith how he got into the NSA spy business. His answer is that when he was a kid he tapped a phone and enjoyed listening to ""conversations"" and knowing that no one knew he was doing it. Coincidence?"
1,The Conversation,"The ConversationI normally love Gene Hackman's acting, so I began this film with anticipation. Thankfully, it cost less than $5.00 - or I would have felt really cheated.I know others highly praise this film, but I found it painful from the start. It is definitely NOT of PG rating - with nudity and Christ's name taken in vain.This movie is depressing from start to finish. I do not recommend it. And, yes, I get all the subtleties and the message... but it just left me totally disappointed."
2,Slow....... Very Slow!,"I tried watching this for about 45 minutes, and turned it off!Granted Hackman's character study is interesting, but the film was so slow... it's like one of those Kubrick films where the camera focuses on the subject for a whole 10-15 minutes.Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.If you want to watch this, you gotta be be verrrry patient."
1,Great Hackman; annoying movie,"Sorry, but with all due deference to those who liked this film, I found it slow, boring, and at times irritating (the constant replaying of the same tape segment, over and over, and over; Alan Garfield going on much too long with his annoying pestering of Hackman). The plot wasn't all that big a deal, nor was the contrived ""twist"" ending a terribly big surprise.Nonetheless, Hackman is terrific (as always) and the thing is well written and acted. Coppola is clearly using the film as a device to make a statement about privacy, but neither as entertainment nor suspense did it work for me."
1,What a waste of money!!!!,"Man I thought this would be an interesting movie because of Francis Ford Coppola, was I wrong. This was so boring, there was absolutely nothing interesting in this movie what so ever. If you want to see Gene Hackman doing some surveillance work just buy ENEMY OF THE STATE if you haven't already. What a dissappointment."
1,The Conversation...is a boring one!,"Ugh.....I was really psyched to see a film that would be juicy and all I got was a long-drawn-out, hollow flick written, directed and played out by big-time names! I feel like I wasted 2 hrs. of my life watching this thing. Two better films on intrigue are ""The Falcon & the Snowman"" and ""Three Days of the Condor""."
2,I REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE IN THE 70'S AND LIKING IT VERY MUCH,"So, when I saw it offered, I bought it. I don't know what changed, but this time around i didn't like it. It was slow, boring and trite. And I so love Gene Hackman. This one just did not work for me at all. I really can't recommend it."
3,"Classic, but a bit slow","Fans of Gene Hackman in ""Enemy of the State"" may find this Seventies movie worth a look. Any fans of spy movies will probably find this an interesting movie as well. When an electronics surveillance expert, played by Hackman, is hired to monitor a couple he becomes concerned for their lifes when he finds out the wife is having an affair. The husband is the jealous type and politically very powerful. The story takes a dramatic twist in the end that you probably won't anticipate. Good parts from Cindi Williams, Robert Duvall, and Harrison Ford. Well made movie with good cast, sets, and music. My only complaint is it seems to plod along and for a current young audience this may be boring. I recommend it as a rental but not to purchase."
3,Moral Quandary,"""The Conversation"" was made in 1974, and has a tremendous cast, featured and supporting. Gene Hackman plays a loner, who also happens to be a genius in surveillance. He is admired by his peers on his meticulous work and a policy of never getting personally involved. However, he faces a moral quandary when he suspects that a couple whose conversation he's been hired to record will be murdered. He does not want to get involved, but the surveillance tape becomes something that challenges his code of non-intervention.Slowly he succumbs to getting emotionally involved with a young couple he has taped. It is an interesting case and raises issues on Big Brother and technology in general.The paranoid lifestyle of a surveillance pro is examined along with a surprising plot. The supporting cast is amazing, as it includes Harrison Ford, John Cazale and Teri Garr."
2,Boring and Overrated,"Maybe I just don't get it. The reading of all these positive reviews baffles me. Did I see the same movie everyone else did? The beginning of ""The Conversation"" showed so much promise. I liked it and was interested. That lasted only the first 15 minutes. After that I struggled to finish watching it. I watched the entire movie only to see if it got any better. It didn't. The person I watched it with fell asleep. I was bored almost the entire movie. If you base the movie solely on the way Gene Hackman played his character it was great. Gene Hackman did a great job portraying a very paranoid man. However, it is everything else in the movie that makes it not enjoyable. I was glad when it was finally over. I much rather watch ""Enemy of the State"". Now that's an exciting movie!"
3,The Coversation DVD,"I have been wanting to see this film again for many years. Having the DVD now itwas surprising to see that the film had dated somewhat from the last time Ihad seen it but it was still great to watch again. The DVD package itself iswell presented with a good picture and sound quality. Coppola fans, like myself,will enjoy the period documentary on the film with many candid moments from theset. Theres also a film trailer. Watch out for a supporting role that has apre-Star Wars Harrison Ford."
4,Great suspense and movie!,"The Conversation is an excellent movie. It combines a lot of suspense with a good story line that just doesn't stop. Gene Hackman plays a surveillance expert, best in his field, in the throws of insanity. When a routine recording of two people in a park seem just a little too strange, Hackman who normally takes a disinterested stand in his work begins to read into it. He starts listening to the recordings and avoids the client. Already paranoid and living a reclusive life, his sanity begins to crumble as the tapes contents, the people, and the conversation play on his psyche. He begins to doubt everyone he meets and the entire movie takes a ""Rear Window"" type of feel. I definately recomend this to anyone who likes nail chewing, high suspense without the corny dialog movies. A lot of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat and there won't be a sound! Definately a great movie, even for the 70's!"
5,Amazing Movie,"This movie will take a few times to understand completely. I spent a long time trying to understand the tapes that Harry Caul records, but if you understand that the tapes are just part of a conspiracy and that the people who are recorded on the tapes know they are being recorded then the movie will make much more sense. I really loved this movie, Gene Hackman is great. It reminds me of his role in Enemy of the State. If you like survelliance movies then this is a must see."
5,Still Creepy After All These Years,"Question -- would The Conversation remain as brilliant as I remembered it from more than 30 years ago? Last Saturday night the emphatic answer -- yes. Yes to Gene Hackman as the ""best bugger"" on the West Coast. Yes, to watching a man's past turn on his present. Yes, to Coppola's searing flashes of fantasy in Harry Caul's mind. Yes, to the pleasure of seeing Robert Duvall and, especially, Harrison Ford before fame. Yes, to a movie that foregoes the easy photographic pleasures of San Francisco and gets instead its grit and its banality. The Conversation is a great movie for its time, for this time, and -- I suspect -- for any time."
4,"""Apt""","The best thing about the film is the particular conversation that happens between a man and a woman.To hear that conversation, repeatedly, you must watch this film just once. No, this film won't change your life but yeah it will make you smile that odd smile we go to the movies to watch. It's been 33 years and I should add this film has aged well. WATCH OUT FOR THE START. This is an ideal watch when alone. Don't watch it with Harry or Sally. A dog? Yeah, maybe. Cheers."
4,A must see for film buffs,"This is not an action-packed, slam bang film but it is very exciting nonetheless. Ahead of its time."
3,Over-rated,"Apres ""The Godfather,"" Francis Ford Coppola decided to indulge his artistic urges and this is what he produced. It's arty alright, but it's also very boring. Gene Hackman is wasted. A very young Harrison Ford is a hoot to see, though. There's a limited jazz soundtrack. It's primarily interesting as a film to look back at the very dated early '70s styles."
2,What's All the Fuss About??,"I think Gene Hackman is a wonderful actor and does not disappoint in this movie. But the movie itself is not at all like a Hitchcock film; I don't understand the comparison. It is slow-moving and lacks suspense. I know what Coppola was trying to do, show that the listener was now the one being listened to, but it didn't play well. His character is difficult to like. Harrison Ford shows up in a small role, but even that does not save this movie. You'd be better off skipping this one; another example of critics offering too much praise for a film."
2,"Some nice moments, nice scenes from back when","There were a few things to like about this movie, the nerdy surveillance experts, the girls they pick up, somehow, at a surveillance convention, the tricks they play on each other as they try to figure out each other's methods, but the music was dreadful -- it was loudly overused to cue the watcher to feel apprehension or whatever emotion they wanted you to feel. Extremely annoying and loud at the end. The story itself is dull and the directing is also kind of obvious with sudden cuts to things meant to shock. It's dated in that respect. Modern movies do this much better. The main character, played well by Gene Hackman, is not that exciting and the filmmaker would have done better to accept that and let it be more low-key instead of trying to, literally, jazz it up with jazz and your basic Jaws-like theme. Very weird to try to watch a serious movie with that music!The Lives of Othersis the movie to watch instead."
2,Too bitter for my taste,"I love tahini and regularly use it in several recipes. I usually buy Joyva tahini in the grocery store, but I prefer Amazon's lower prices. I recently ordered this brand based on the positive review. However, I find it unusually bitter, strong enough that it makes whatever I put it in bitter also, and I've had to toss out the food. It might be a matter of personal taste, but I haven't had bitter tahini before. I am disappointed with this purchase and wished I would have spent the few extra dollars for the Joyva tahini."
4,MECO Grill,"We've had the grill for a month and can't use it. The wrong legs were sent and we've yet to receive the correct ones. This after 2 faxes and 3 phone calls. Supposedly they respond within 24 hours. Not true.However, we have an old MECO grill that we're replacing with this one and expect it to work great once we get the correct legs."
2,Bad chain,"I had the necklace for a couple weeks and the chain broke. It was not a good chain to start with but since I only had it for a couple weeks I didn't expect to have to replace it so soon. The pendant itself is pretty, if you are okay with replacing the chain then its an okay buy!"
2,There are much better church history books,"I found it annoying that Frend mentions the new manuscripts found since his first edition yet he chose not to include them in this revised edition. One of my classmates noted it seemed a ""rough draft"". A history book is hard to follow when the author continues to move back and forth through time without any warning. Many passages have to be re-read in frustration to determine the decade or century Frend is discussing. The later chapters were more comprehensible than the first 15. Frend could have explained the developing theologies better."
3,Its ok,"Its a decent book overall. My biggest problem is you can see a lot of the Author's opinion which I would question throughout the book. But the facts he gives, and some of the view points are worth a look by those strong evangelicals who know the scriptures well."
1,You have to continually buy this software - stay away from it!,"I bought this software for about $30. Here is what you don't find out until later: once you print 200 checks, you are required to buy a validation code to print more checks at more than having some other vendor print them for you! This important information is not included in big type - only after using the product. It is like Microsoft or Adobe charging you each time you generate a document. Hopefully, we will see sham companies like VersaCheck go away. I have yet to see many positive reviews on this product including amazon, cnet, ebay and others."
5,"excellent, cheap & no special ink required","I purchased the software 10 years ago and have not upgraded so it sounds like the newer product has some problems but the old software works great and I have transfered it to 4 computers over the years with no problems at all. As for the check paper, that also works well and I don't need to use the special MICR ink, I use 2 different banks and have never had a problem with any of my checks in the past 10 years that I have been using it for the Church bookeeping and my personal use."
1,Do not purchase this product,I bought this product because I needed checks for my business. What they don't tell you is you need to purchase their additional software and their specialize ink (all separate additional costs). It takes more time and hassle and also cost more money than purchasing checks from your bank.I do not recommend this product.
3,Good Experience,I called customer service before purchasing this product. I was given the wrong information so I received the wrong product. I called customer service. They gave me credit for the shipping for the mistake. I will order from them again.
2,Stops working,This game worked great untill close to the end the game freezes and does not work!!! My whole xbox 360 does not do anything!!!
5,Braided chews are Belle's favorite.,"My black lab, Belle, loves the braided chews. These are a special treat for her when she has to spend a lot of time indoors due to inclement weather. Keeps her occuoied for a good amount of time. We only give her rawhide when we are there to supervise. Good product!"
2,Not what you need to start a business,"This book served as a general overview of the billing from home business, but does not give details on getting started. Not a good book to rely on if your looking to start your own business."
4,If you like this sort of thing,"this is the sort of thing you'll like.Back in the 1200s or so, a curious book was writtenabout sexual mores and manners in cosmopolitan,urbane Muslim society. Much MUCH later, it wastranslated into French. Somewhat later, theFrench version was translated into English. Thisaccounts for occasional awkwardnesses, but overallthis is quite readable.As Gay Sunshine Press is known for books of gay/lesbianinterest (duh), this book has been edited to emphasizethe sections of interest to that reading population.To be frank, most of this is of limited general interest;a recitation of jokes and snapqueen insults traded bypeople who lived almost a thousand years ago is ofnecessity a minority taste. The very idea that agiven society had a recognized homosexual subculturethat long ago is a big part of this book's appeal.There are a number of anecdotes and stories thatgive one a fair impression of this subculture.All in all, I'm glad I have this book."
3,Skid Row,"This is a pretty decent overview plus a couple rare tracks are nice, but where is ""Wasted Time""?....which just happens to be my fav Skid Row track; and they even had a proper video for it back in the day. Also missing are a few other favs like ""Firesign"", ""Eileen"" (Subhuman Race), and ""In A Darkened Room"" (Slave To The Grind).Even the song ""Beggars Day"" from the clean version of 'Slave To The Grind' would have been another great element to make this CD complete.Would have taken Frozen, Beat Yourself Blind, and My Enemy off. I must have a weird idea of what their great songs were, because it's hard to believe my 2 fav songs from Subhuman Race, plus my all time favorite song by them are not even included here."
5,White Limozeen by Dolly Parton,"I had the cassette ""White Limozeen"" and wanted to purchase the CD. Thanks to Amazon.com I was able to purchase it. I love Dolly Parton's music. The CD is great,my favortie song ""He's Alive"" is so uplifting it gives me goose bumps everytime I listen to it.Chuck Friend"
5,Very good cd. Listening to it now!,It has alot of fast songs which i enjoy. I've listened to this cd for a long time. As i type i'm listening to it.
5,The Best of Black 47,"This is Black 47's best CD. Black 47 is one of the best live bands around, always giving 110%, and this album helps you appreciate their original sound and their hard work. This is also their last album with Chris still in the band, and his voice and hip-hop influences are currently missed. Every person for whom I have played this album is now a Black 47 fan as well, joining the loyal family of followers."
5,Giving all they can,"LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY puts Black 47 in a time capsule. A band that feeds on audience participation and feedback, Black 47 is in its element here, jumping on Rudy Giuliani, yelling at the slam dancers, and making the audience work as hard as they do. The band is as loose as can be, reflecting Kirwan's sheer joy as a performer, the band going off on tangent's and other than telling the audience that this was being recorded, you get the feeling that this is the way the band always approaches a show and this is the way the audience always responds. Mixing Irish Ska with protests and reels, the band really doesn't fit into any category save one: a live band that gives the audience all they can ask for."
4,RAW,"Black 47 is straight up raw and unradio friendly. Its all about having a good time and being moved. This cd still doesnt come close to seeing them but I guess its the closest thing. Larry's guitar playing isnt the most skillful but when your lyrics and music are based on blood and love, they dont have to be. The cd is nice but see these guys live! James Conelly will bring you to tears every time."
4,Great!,Im not 21 so its hard to see Black 47 play live anywhere. This was perfect for me. Its a great live album capturing everything from these previously released songs. Each song is slightly modified as well. It was great. Well worth buying. I would have liked to see some other of my fav songs on here though. Maybe next CD.
4,Why almost all the same songs as previous CD's.,I am desperate to hear some new material. Why the same songs on this CD as on their previous ones.
3,One of a kind,"Black 47 is one of a kind and this album confirms it. This band needs to be heard live to be fully appreciated and this is the next best thing. The sound and clearity is superb for a live album. If you got young kids at home watch some of the lyrics or better yet buy Kirwan's Keltic Kids too. BTW, does anyone ever wonder that if Mr. Funky Ceili is doing so well why don't he send Bridie and the boy some stinking tickets. Yo!"
1,"Adds a ""Trivial"" Amount of Trans Fat","It tastes ok, but the hidden ""trivial amounts"" of trans fat, meaning less than 1 gram, adds up quickly. The package admits: ""Hydrogenated Soybean Oil (Adds a Trivial Amount of Trans Fat)"". I will stick with popcorn brands that care enough not to add oils that will not clog my arteries and theaten my life span."
2,Why Not Actually Read the Books?,Tolkien's books are brilliant. Why read cheat sheets? You can just enjoy the fantastic majesty of his novels.
1,Disgusting travesty!,"The Lord of The Rings is NOT a text-book! It is a book that should be read with love, joy and wonderment, not EXPLAINED with notes and NOT set as a text so generations of children will associate it with drudgery, compulsion and class-rooms. This is an act of cultural vandalism and barbarism by idiot teachers and rip-off merchants who have no feeling for literature, joy or the sponanious enjoyment of a great tale!"
5,"A wealth of information, strongly recommended!","The editors fully succeeded in their goals of creating a comprehensive, credible, and user-friendly dictionary of nearly 600 terms, grounded in basic and applied research. This reference presents the input of over 225 contributors with terms ranging from 360 degree appraisals and at-risk pay to learning organization, KSAOs, and workplace violence. The definitions are truly encyclopedic in nature, with much detail and each carries a bibliography. Nations, laws and associations are also included. A wealth of information, strongly recommended!"
4,"E. Greenville, PA",Twinlab vitamins are great and easy to digest. The Cran-1-Daily helps keep the urinary tract free from infection. Have ordered from the Vitamin Shoppe before and find they mail orders out promptly and in good condition.
2,not horrible...but why bother?,"I gave this ONE listen and I don't think I'll ever touch it again. This is insulting...even for Roadrunner Records. While I admit it could be alot worse, the bottom line is WHY BOTHER?!? This review is just my opinion and the majority of reviewers for this title seem to think it's pretty good but I would definitely suggest listening to the samples before you purchase this one, otherwise you might be extremely dissapointed."
4,Good punk rock.,Not groundbreaking but it definitely fits the bill if you're looking for some good punk rock. Whatever happened to these guys?
3,Not Bad,"Coming from a background that includes a lot of hardcore punk, it's hard for me to rave about this album. Not that it's bad. It's fairly good, especially for a proper debut. But it's nothing I haven't heard before. The songs are sure to excite those who like a good mosh album and incite those who like political lyrics. While they lack the great guitar work of a band like Black Flag or the melodies of a band like Bad Religion, they do a nice job of running a middle ground between the two. They also threw in some heavier, more metal elements to a couple of songs. My only big complaint was that their lyrics were hard to make out at times and what I did hear sounded like it was a bit general. My advice to them would be to sharpen up the lyrics and add some diversity to the song structures. Otherwise, this is an above average debut from a band who could be around for a while."
5,Must Read for Cochlear Implant Canidates,"Read about the emotions and real life experiences of individuals of all ages, who have lost their hearing or have been born deaf.You'll be in awe as you read about their miraclous journey into the hearing world through the help of cochlear implants.Wonderful book with inspiring stories."
3,"Interesting, eh?","Well, it seems that modern technology has made reviews for imaginary books possible. How ironic, the sellers of the book actually promoting the disintegration of real literitaure (not a spelling mistake, this is the original germanic root)....psuedo-intellectuals need not apply"
4,Neo-Bossa Nova,"If you love old school Bossa Nova, you will enjoy this eclectic mix of Neo ""electronica"" Bossa Nova. Sublime drum beats intertwined with horns, xylophone and classic Brazilian instruments. A true treat for the ears. It contains music from various artists with a heartfelt love and passion for the original Bossa Nova. Songs like Guaio a Caracas, Destino, and Listen Love will Wisk you away to the shores of Brazil. As the generations come and go, in time these songs will become classics as well."
3,Good Book for Parents,A good book for parents interested in succession of a family business. Not exactly what I was looking for - that's why the 3 stars. Still enjoyed reading it.
4,Keeping it Genuine,"The author holds nothing back and tells it like it is to work in a family business. It is extremely difficult and takes hard work and keeping a lot of what you are thinking to yourself. Good book - would recommend anyone reading it before they are getting into a family business or if you are already working for the family and need comfort that you are not alone. If you liked this book, you may also enjoy Sons in the Shadow, a book about a son working for his fatherSONS IN THE SHADOW"
4,More Truth Than Many of Us Want to Admit,"As a family business counselor and consumate reader, I continually look for new materials that can help clients--family members and non-family managers--better understand the family business enterprises in which they are employed...or enmeshed.The title of this book turned me off. I know of no family business that can avoid the ""socalled 7 deadly sins."" Family baggage is part of family business.Nonetheless, I recommend the book. My usual use of the book is education of non-family managers who work for family business. My favorite reading references for professional managers are by John L. Ward: Keeping the Family Business Healthy, and his revised, expanded update, Strategic Planning for the Family Business.Family members may be willing to read the book, although I have limited experience with that. I would refer them to books like Working With The Ones You Love by Dennis Jaffe."
5,A Bargain Investment to check your Family Business Health,"This book is a ""healthy"" reflection of time bombs unique to a family business. As a coach to family businesses, I can't stress enough that what can go wrong will go wrong at the time least expected.The book's title is somewhat a turn off - in my opinion, these are not sins, but human nature at work - something most people are aware of, but avoid to address - and hope they will magically resolve themselves and go away. Further, there could also be a lack of knowing how to avoid them - or they simply do not apply.However, I highly recommend the book based on it's content and for the topics covered. It is an easy read, and bargain investment, to figure out if your family business has committed, or is on the road to committing, one or several of the ""seven sins""."
5,brings back memories,What a great group! I wonder why they did not make together longer...I love this sound...
3,FINALLY,THE MOVIE WAS COOL. HAVE BEEN WAITING A FEW YEARS FOR IT'S RELEASE.MY COUSIN WAS IN THE MOVIE. PLUS MY BOY TURTLE FROM THE ENTOURAGE DID HIS THING. IT'S A GOOD BUY
2,Surprise ending,"This is your typical redneck comedy until the last comic, Ron Shock, does his bit about a suicide committed with a bolt-action rifle. Hilarious! Worth it just to see him - but it would be better to just get one of his DVD's from his website."
5,Redneck Comedy RoundUp,Fantastic DVD fast postage and in great quality! Highly rcommend both the DVD and the suppplier.
4,my friend flicka/thunderhead,Older movies but classic. Famous actors of the 50's. The books were well written. Enjoyed reading and seeing the flims.
4,A MUST HAVE FROM THE QUINTESSENTIAL DISCO LABEL,"This CD is worth every penny. It includes the PROMO ONLY of Donna Summer's On The Radio, a short but more potent version of Pleasure Island and the gorgeous -- Music, Harmony and Rhythm by Brooklyn Dreams. The only problem I have with the CRS Box Set is that two of the most gorgeous and technically advanced songs where cut to less then half. The two songs are Romeo and Juliet and I've Found Love. These two songs alone, in full length versions, would be worth the price. Romeo and Juliet was the first record to use 48 tracks. Alec R. did this by attaching two 24 track modules. I've Found Love has the most over-the-top 7 minute brake of any disco song. Of course they are out of print."
4,Casablanca Collection,"This set any of you DJ's will find is Promo Copies that are pressed on Cd - Great recording & editing ..as far as the Buck ? Donna Summer screams all over the collection , Village People , Liquid Gold - a rare track .. enjoy - sit back - and listen to "" Love to Love you baby "" its 16 min .. Enough said !!"
2,Unneccesary,"The DS charger that comes with the DS is the best charger you'll get. It's compact and serves its purpose. You won't need this, it's too bulky and does the job just as well as the included DS charger."
1,"Only for DS LIte, not as described for Nintendo DS","Bought this for Nintendo DS, as we only had a UK power cord. The item despatched is only for DS Lite, so had to return it. An image on the item description may have helped!"
2,Pretty crappy for such a great artist.,"I really enjoy Nick Cave's music and I have almost all of his CDs. He has a deep and poetic lyrical style that is rare in popular music today. So when I saw his DVD of music videos, I was intrigued. Man was I let down. Maybe two or three of the videos are tolerable, most are bad and a few are outright terrible. I am pretty forgiving to low budget productions in most cases. Usually I can get passed the cheap sets and poor camera work on videos, if they are creative. But something about these videos' cheap production was just plain bad. If you like Nick Cave, stick to his audio collection and just pretend you never saw this DVD."
1,The bad seeds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The bad seeds certainly! I liked Where The Wild Roses Grow, because the video is excellent. Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue are great in this one, but I figure that's just because I like Kylie and nothing else but Nick is good in this one! The only Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds video I like."
4,bad seeds don't fall far from the tree,"Videos are, demonstrably, not a strong point for the Bad Seeds. Neither are they a point of interest for the band. If you are interested in inspired and objectively interesting videos, look elsewhere. However, if you like to watch Nick Cave dance around while Blixa Bargeld looks very pretty in the background, you've found your match. The commentary between the videos is entertaining and offers a glimpse into the minds of the otherwise taciturn Bad Seeds. This is a collection for the collectors, or the über-fans."
4,A Mixed Bag...,"I love Nick Cave and his musical stylings and these videos are the best way to experience it beyond watching them live. Some of the videos here are better than others. Stagger Lee is great, campy fun, Red Right Hand is ominous and strangely creepy, while Henry Lee finds Cave and his former lover PJ Harvey giving themselves up to a one-take of visible passion and tension. Loverman (later covered by Metallica), is a loud hypnotic ride (literally) as the band gets filmed being put into a trance by a professional hypnotist.Other stand out videos include the behind the scenes road trip piece, Wanted Man, the live, I Had A Dream Joe and the beginning of the Mercy Seat shot in stark black and white. The rest are underbudgeted yet still worthy of a look."
3,Intriguing...,"Well, what can be said that hasn't been mentioned in the other reviews? Pretty much nothing...The photo quality of the videos is very grainy, mostly due to the fact that they were all mostly filmed on low-tech gear (my, how technology has changed in the past few years) except for the video done with Kylie Minogue. The difference is very apparant.Audio quality is fairly interesting as well. I don't know if the problem is on my end, or if it was a manufacturers defect with the encoding on the disk, but the sound (particularly the bass) has a lot of pops to it. I also purchased the God is in the House DVD, and had no problems with that particular audio facet. I also found spots to where the tempos changed mid-play.I would have rated this product lower, but I figured in the fact that the video recording gear came from the Stone Age...All in all, a good purchase still for any Nick Cave fan. Many of these videos are nigh impossible to find anywhere, so if you MUST have them, buy this DVD."
1,This bed doesn't come with a pump!,I ordered this airbed from Amazon and was surprised to find no pump. I had to rush off and buy an external pump that worked just fine. But be warned that this airbed DOES NOT COME WITH A PUMP.
2,Awful print!,"My husband gave me this DVD for Christmas, and we both watched it last night. The acting is good, but, as other reviewers have commented, the print stinks! The quality is so poor that at times it was difficult to even distinguish between Mary Astor and another young actress. The film is worth seeing, but do NOT watch this 1924 version until it is remastered and redistributed by another DVD company."
5,A fun book to read with your baby,"I bought this book when my daughter was only 6 months old and she loved it right away! The blue fish appears on each page and after reading the book a few times, she was able to point out the blue fish- the illustrations are so captivating that my baby paid attention to every detail right away! I am planning to get the rest of the series- I know she'll love them."
4,Best lab book,"This book provides comprehensive review of all blood profile diagnostics divided by cell-type. I use this book all the time because it is very easy and comprehensive in listing differentials for blood changes. It has a section on diseases and classic changes in blood profiles for each disease. The book also includes information on special diagnostic tests such as ACTH stims, low-dose dex suppressions, etc. I have seen other lab diagnostic books, and this one is by far the best."
4,Barbie's Beagle a BIG Hit!,"My 4-year-old niece hasn't been anywhere without her new puppy, dubbed ""Daisy"", since the night she got it. I hope it inspires her to be a veterinarian when she grows up!"
2,poor design,"This is a one size, fits all, type of kit, with a poor design. It can interfere with the action of the existing springs, and I was not confident that it would stay in place and not migrate. I made my own mounting kit that is clamped under the existing spring-to-axle clamps. This makes it more sturdy and reliably holds the super springs in place."
3,Pretty.,"This deck has some very beautiful and intriguing pictures.They are, however, very difficult to interpret, which tends to leave me staring at the very skimpy booklet with the deck. It includes some facinating artist info, some suggestions on reading the deck using the colored side and the black and white side, and then has one line card meanings. One line. This way, they can print one booklet with five languages in it. This is a problem with all of LS's decks that I've purchased.It may be that with a full book, this would be a deck that I can read, but for now, it's just pretty pictures."
2,Air bed review,"I purchased this bed few weeks ago. I had out of town visitors and ended up giving my bed to the visitors and I slept on this bed. Two complaints...1) it is leaking air, so if you pump it up at night to a hard bed, it is very soft or not sleepable by the am. 2) the area where it kinks up for a sitting up position is also troublesome when in flat position. There is a GAP there and you feel it when sleeping or should I say trying to sleep."
1,a terrible terrible product,..this is a worthless product. The mattress deflates in six hours even tho no one has touched it. The company behind it is very spooky and barricades itself behind the appearance of recourse which is actuallyWenzel Signature Series Insta-bed Premium Queen Size Airbeddesigned to be impenetrable. No one should buy this product.
1,Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed,"Due to the consruction of the top section, the edges of the bed stay firmly inflated, but the center portion does not and you ""roll"" to the center of the bed whether you want to or not. Also, this makes it difficult to climb out of the bed. The portion of the bed that you can raise is a good idea for someone who has just had surgery (which is why I ordered it), or for someone who likes to read in bed, but the manufacturer needs to work on the construction of the air chambers."
1,poor choice,I purchased this item for extra sleeping for guests coming in for Christmas. Set the bed up and inflated it to make sure it worked - by morning the top mattress was deflated by half. Refilled it and checked the next morning - same thing- with no one even sleeping on it!
1,not firm,"i recently purchase this item, i weight 140lbs. i used this product twice it become a bathtub where it sink in the middle and the both end corner rise up. this product is not supportive as they say from my experience."
2,it broke,Maybe not the best idea but i attempted to use this bed as my regular bed and after about 2 weeks it unsealed with a hole in a seam and that was that. it just couldnt be inflated for that long straight and be slept on for that long staight with a 150 pound guy on it so i give it a thumbs down for durability.
1,A Piece of S**T,"This was a big waste of money. The first day of use, my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night.I thought maybe it was because two people were on it. A couple of monthe later I had another guest sleep on it. He had to do the same thing. IHe ended up sleeping on the couch. He thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway.Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,unique but flawed,"While I really like the air bed for nightly use,Wenzel Queen Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed with Built-in AC Pumpthis one, with the unique feature of being able to raise the upper part to a desired angle, has a flaw. It's only good for one person to sleep on because it sags in the center. I've used air beds for a couple of years and found them to be great for back and joint pain. I finally woke up pain free once I started using them. It's still a comfortable bed, but would be much better if it didn't sag."
2,Deflates every time!!,This mattress has deflated on my guests since the first time I used it. Very aggravating because it's a pain in the you-know-what to send something this large/heavy/bulky back.
4,No complaints,"No real complaints to do with the shipping or handling of the product. Was shipped fast and had no problems with any of that. It's nice to go back to the old format, instead of 2007. This was required for a class I had to take to learn how to use Word and was exactly what I needed."
5,The voice of an Angel,"The first time I heard this album, I couldn't believe my ears. Her vocal range and sultry voice are like nothing I've heard before. ""Hold me for a while"" is by far one of the loveliest ballads I've ever heard. I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert, and that is a treat to behold."
5,THE Ultimate DVD,"Ok, after walking out of the theater, this movie was on the top of my DVD list. I loved it after watching it the first time and it was even better the second time. Different people watch movies for different reasons, but I think this one does a good job to try and make it interesting for a larger crowd. It's got an interesting storyline, clever jokes, and great action.I personally love the effects and sound. For anyone with a decent sound system, this DVD is a MUST-own. Whenever I go into an electronics store, I expect to find Titan A.E. being shown as a demo because it would be perfect to show of the digital 5.1 channel sound. You will not be dissappointed if sound and effects are your thing."
3,Another Waste of a Potentially Good Story,"Growing up with Japanese ""anime"" since 1968, I have seen many resembling this type of sci-fi. While the visuals are at the cutting edge of today's animated titles, the story was very ""rushed."" If this movie was indeed a series, I believe it would have been a much better feature. The story unfolds too quickly, and the emotions of Earth's destruction doesn't even settle before you're in the middle of an adventure. You barely have time to relate to each character before the story forces you to go on. As in most movies of this sort, character interaction is very predictable and lacks personality. It is indeed a wasted potential, as I really enjoyed the overall plot..."
5,space invadiors,"Props to Matt Damon he did his thang voicing ""Cale"" same goes for Drew Barrymore. This was not some disney sing along movie they played cool music one was the band ""Creed"". Fox may never do a cartoon with this kind of animation or minor nudity and a little blood like this movie that makes me mad. America could be doing cartoon's just like anime. This movie was about some aliens distroyed the Earth then years have passed Cale has grown up he has the map on his hand that leads to the titan that can create planet earth again."
5,Better than Disney (more teen than kid),This show was great. The music was way good and so were the graphics. Lots bettter than Star Wars Episode 1. I think the moviemakers are starting to see and aim movies towards the teen audiences. Not all movies have to be adult movies. Besides teens have all the time in the world to see a movie were as adults have work. Most peoples work schedule doens't include a summer break.
3,When will American filmmakers get it?,"Titan A.E. was a film I had been waiting eagerly for ever since I first saw it's previews on Star Wars I in 99. Although I admit I liked the movie, and would definately rent the DVD, I must say I'm still very dissapointed.American Filmmakers - get over your fear of putting adult content into animated movies! It worked fine for Heavy Metal! I do not believe the movie does bad in theatres because it is animated, but rather because the content failed to appeal to it's target audience! We are starving for decent anime, and it would be really nice to not have to wait a couple years to get the English translation from japan for once.thank you :)"
3,"3 1/2 stars, actually....","The only thing that really bothered me about this movie, is that the villains (Drej) are given no motivavtion to wipe out humanity. So, right off the bat, the plot is really kind of weak. However, as stated numerous times before, the animation was very interesting and the action scenes were pretty cool. Fans of animation should want to check this out at least once. Very entertaining, just don't expect a high caliber script."
4,Titan A.E.,"This is an American made anime, that said its very good, maybe that's just because I loved it when it first come out. That was quite a few years back, I picked it up because my vhs copy died on my. It looks great in the dvd format. Definitely a great addition to any movie collection"
3,Titan A.E. ...,"Fast shipping and delivery. It's not what i was expecting, but was pleasantly suprised anyway. Thanx."
5,"Lots of fun, easy to watch again, and MAN does it sound good!","This is one of those DVDs every audio nut is probably going to have. It just sits there on your shelf along with other necessities. Finding Nemo has some impressive scenes that give your subwoofer a workout, and so does this film.Animation isn't bad, and use of some CG helps keep it interesting and strikes an good balance between ""almost realism"" and the cartoon/animated portion. Overall the art direction is good, but if you have a sound system worth bragging about this movie is simply unreal. It will piss off your neighbors and let you know what's not tied down in your theater room.For the price this movie sells for, you simply can't not have it."
4,"Fairly Good, Some Missed Potential, See Once At Least","I think the music was a little flat and repetitive, and could have used some inspiration. The storyline could have been tightened to avoid slow spots and predictability. Personalities could have been developed more.However, I am a nitpicky perfectionist and even if I made a cartoon myself, I probably still wouldn't be satisfied. The animation is great; there is some bare skin and a little violence (Earth blows up, a big roach gets zapped, and a weird alien gets chop-chopped), none of which really bothered me but might be inappropriate for younger kids. I liked Chicken Run better but enjoyed this 'toon as well. See it once, why not?"
3,Maybe for Kids,"I don't know if this was what I was waiting for. (the box declares, ""the movie star wars fans have been waiting for"") Actually I didn't even know I was waiting for something. More likely than not this would better suit the age range of 6-15 than adult. However, the illusrations and visuals of this movie are outstanding. Great audio as well. Some of the best I have ever seen in an cartoon film or anime if you prefer."
4,The best since Star Wars!,"This movie is some kind of a mix between Independance Day and Star Wars: the Drej and their ships (including the mothership) remind me of ID4, but everything else is totally Star Wars only missing the Force, the light sabers and Darth Vader. Cale(voice by Matt Damon) looks like Luke Skywalker, Akima(voice by Drew Barrymore) is almost a Leia, but not a princess though, Korso(voice by Bill Pullman) is a rough Han Solo and even the Valkyrie is a mix between the X-Wing with the Millenium Falcon! It has some of the prettiest images of 2000, and the FXs are super. The plot is good, with an unexpected twist in the middle. But, it was a little unlucky on the box office. It had sucess but the money that Fox Animated Studios invested on this, meant their rupture. But I'm sure that we don't heard the last of Fox Animation Studios, and it will rise again to present us with more masterpieces like this one. 8 out of 10, 4 stars out of 5."
4,TITAN A.E.,"I just bought a DVD player and I wanted to watch something animated, but sci-fi in nature. This was a great choice. It was made for a large screen, but is breathtaking even on a computer screen. It is a little cliche on the dialogue at points, but it holds together well. It could have been fantastic (a classic maybe)if it's script was geared to adult audiences."
4,A Must See,"When this movie was featured at the theaters, I was not too excited to see it. While I was shopping for movies, I came across this movie on sale. I've been in a buying frenzy as of late, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was blown away by the art and storyline. I have not listened to the commentary yet, but the DVD comes with a variety of neat features like deleted scenes - it was nice to see the before and after look of various scenes. You will not be disappointed in the movie."
3,Titan After Earth,"The story was okay, but what I really loved about the movie, was voice acting and how characters were brought to life. It felt realistic like when they were moving and showing their emotions. Despite the fact that they are drawn, they were given life. I can't say I loved the characters, but they were okay and I definitely disliked the smart alien which was too annoying. The graphics and the world were not the best drawings. It's a watchable cartoon with a good soundtrack."
2,"animation good- story bad, bad","Perhaps I was expecting too much from the creators of Anastasia, where the background digital animation and characters seemed to fit better, but I was dissapointed in the effort (or lack thereof) in this movie. While many of the digital animated scenes are great, the somewhat crude character animation kept interrupting the great background work. The story itself VERY liberally ""borrowed"" from many other, better scifi films. The entire ""orphaned boy saves everybody"" has been done to death, starting with Star Wars, all the characters were stock cliches from other films, and the ending was taken right from Star Trek II- The Wrath of Khan. Anyone would be hard pressed to find any original ideas in this film, although there were moments where a good idea (even from someone else's movie) can come alive with the great digital animation."
5,Visually Stunning Artwork,"I caught this underrated movie on FLIX Channel, and it was avisually stunning effort. Some of the opening violence mayupset the younger set, but all in all, it is an involving movie.I would personally, in my opinion, consider this to be very close, if not at the top, of the arts of animation. By far andaway the best animation I've seen in years.Dialogue is a tad on the convoluted side, but stick with it, theending is a hair-raising race to the finish, and the ending isone of hope, something the world could certainly use.Scifi-wise, it was involving, as we don't really know who elseis out there, nor do we know if they are friend, foe, or a mor-tal enemy. Excellent visualization of the Drej, including tran-slations at the bottom of the screen. Good piece of speculativefiction. And well worth adding to your library."
2,Disappointed after all the hype,"I was hooked by this movie last summer when I was the trailer before Star Wars Episode 1, and after a year of waiting I couldn't wait to see it. I was first off disappointed that this movie was your standard pen and paper animation and not cgi, which the trailer led me to believe. Also, the special effects were a real let down, there were some scenes very well done, but many others that looked like they were quickly slapped together. I don't recommend buying this movie, just rent it first to see if its turns your fancy. For me I didn't like it at all."
5,One of the best!,"Okay so Don Bluth was one of the great animation masters of the 80s and 90s and always brought us such happy loving childrens stories into our eyes and hearts that made us melt in our seats. Titan AE did much more. It gave us the future that we wish for not to come but fear and know that it most likely will. This movie captures a revolution in animation and design and delivers a great signature for Don Bluth as an animator. He has brought dogs to heaven, Russian princesses back to throne, and fairies back home, but never has he brought us here to the brink of real fantasy as he did in Titan AE."
5,Reference quality DVD from FOX,"The video and audio quality of this DVD are amazing. The story is a rehash of a million other movies like star wars, matrix, total recall, to name a few. But it is not as bad as most reviewers seem to feel.The DTS track on this DVD rocks! If you want to show off your 5.1 system, this is one of the best DVDs to do so. Especially the last scenes in the ice-rings. The jaw-dropping CGI visuals come to life spectacularly in this DVD.The DD5.1 and DTS do not sound much different from each other, except that the DTS track offers a marginally better clarity. Both tracks are equally good.Congratulations to Peter Staddon of FOX for giving us another fabulous DVD."
2,"Nice animation , shame about the plot .","I saw this a few weeks ago , and was extremely impressed by the animation . The soundtrack was standard punk-rock fare . But sweetness , the plot was so utterly lacking , predictable and formulaic that it almost became a parody of itself . There were alot of references to other films here as well . You'll have to spot them .Lurrrvely animation though - See this one just for the cg ."
4,Remeber the Titan,"I first saw this movie on the day it was released in theaters and I was very impressed by it. It had a good story great effects and a pretty good soundtrack. It had kind of a Anime feel to it as well. Everyone keeps comparing this movie to Star Wars and Star Trek but it did not seem like it had too many elements from Star Wars to me personally. As for having themes from Star Trek I don't reallly know I'm not a big fan of the shows or the movies. I would say it would be better to compare this movie to some of the older Anime titles that involved outer space. All and all this is not a movie you would want to miss be you animation fan, Star Wars fan, Star Trek fan, Anime fan, or if you just like movies. If you have not already seen this movie then I suggest you buy it or rent it , you could be missing out on your next favorite movie."
3,Watch out ! It's animated movie.,"First, when I saw ""Titan"" as a recommendation for me, I noticed that next to the picture of it, there are names of ""Matt Damon, Bill Pullman"". Sci-Fi with these actors and DTS soundtrack certified by THX - no need more recommendations. How big was my surprise, when I played this movie and saw that it is animated! Well, sound is really fantastic. I give 5 ""stars"" for it, but this PG rate is just exaggeration. This is animated movie like Disney's for kids. One ""star"" for movie, overall are three ""stars""."
2,"The ""Heaven's Gate"" of animation!","It's hard to believe 20th Century Fox dished out 80 million dollars to make this movie (when they were stingy with a guaranteed blockbuster like X-Men). Anastasia was Disneyesque but only made a modest 60 or so million. I wish they would add to the DVD a videotaped pitch for this movie, it would probably be more entertaining than the movie itself. I always wondered how films like this get a green light. When was the last time an animated sci-fi film made money in the US that wasn't imported from Japan? If they wanted to attract teenagers, the film needed graphic sex and violence! Titan AE was a monumental bore with nothing new to offer that wasn't already used in ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", or ""Alien."" But the making of it may be something to see. My pitch for 20th Century Fox would be ""The Heaven's Gate of Animation!"""
3,"good ideas, bad script full of plot holes and devices","It ends up feeling like a series of videogame cutscenes, and most of the script feels like fast exposition to get from plot point A to plot point B. Everything is so predictable and characters seem to take on completely different agendas and personalities on the drop of a dime. I don't get the praise, because there definitely isn't much here AT ALL. Disappointing..."
4,pleased,I am very happy with the product I order. Came within estimated dates and was in decent condition. Would order again.
2,What was it exactly?,"Ok, I saw this in the theatre with my bro not expecting a lot out of it because of my recent history with anime and seeing that being so good. I walked out with the same feeling. I really felt like this was trying to be something it wasn't, some kind of action cartoon. I like Don Bluth and all but stick to mouses ok? I just didn't see it being very ""cool"" at all. And contrary to what some people might think, I beleive that the CG in Blue Submarine #6 is better than this. It may not be as high quality but it is definitely blended better. Just how they integrated it was much nicer, In Titan AE, however, it seemed to have a real gritty feeling and it even looked like it had some slow down.........But whatever. This is just my opinion and I'm stickin to it, so if your a big anime fan not expecting a lot from this, then your probably right and you won't get a lot out of it."
2,saw the digital theatre premiere in atlanta,"The expectations where high for what was an invitation to go see the first digital theatre premiere, with a purely digital presentation of a full featured movie.I felt that the presentation of the movie was indeed nice, a lot of work went into it.However, it seems that the story line is dragging on several occasions, and several people in my immediate audience felt drawn to their timepieces to check how much more there was to go.Eye candy is one thing, but I and several others needed more substance.. Rent, and then buy if you really want to keep it would be my recommendation."
2,Booooorrrrring,"My two stars for solely for the animation. Besides that, this movie lacked any kind of hook. I never grew to like any of the main characters particularly, the storyline was weak, and the ending was totally predictable. I wish we would've rented this one before we bought it, so we would've bought a real movie."
1,Embarassment to humankind,If Titan AE is our last hope then the human race is better off dying. This insipid story follows an unlikable brat and a crew of incompetents in their attempt to save humanity. The story is ham-fisted the characters unlikable. Children might like this movie but adults will need Novocaine to make it through the operation.
2,rip-off after rip-off after rip-off,"the effects and CGI were really good, even acceptable for a movie with actual actors (instead of cartoons) but that would have been 10 times more expensive. I didn't even know it was anime until recently because they advertise it as a movie and just show the space battle scene. Drew Barrymore stunk and Matt Damon well, I'll let you decide. It's clearly a marketing thing, they're not bad actors they just don't belong here. AND THE RIP-OFFS! Every science fiction story ever made contributed at least one line to this movie. Be original! and don't say this is the next star wars just because you blow up the earth in the beginning (see planet ALDERON). Death to the marketers! Give their money to the filmakers!"
3,Not what I expected but still entertaining,"When I first saw the teasers for Titan AE in the theatres last year, I got the impression it was going to be a live-action movie (there were no actual scenes shown in this preview). I was quite surprised when I learned it was animated! We bought the VHS version when it hit the shelves. This was the first time I'd seen it. I really enjoyed the animation, especially the Dredge! Great job on that, guys! My kids love it, although I would not recommend it for very young kids. The all-star voice cast did look impressive, but I agree with one of the previous reviewers' opinion that the voices were flat and inexperienced. I have to say that my favorite character was the chef at the beginning of the movie. :)"
3,Cool animation...,"Titan A.E. is an animated film that has some scenes too familiar to Star Wars scenes. The big fans of S.W. will pick up on them. So, so much for total originality. What this movie did have was pretty cool animation and some actors voices you may recognize, and a story line that held my interest long enough. It was hard to imagine Nathan Lane as a bug eating bug when(Hello, Lion king fans),after hearing him as the sidekick in Lion King. Remember he sang ""Haikuna Matata""? It wasn't too bad, worth a rental if you are a fan of animated films. It might be a little too long for the younger children"
4,Enjoyable film - hit and miss CGI,"Titan AE has an enjoyable story which reminds the viewer a bit of Star Wars, but it's a lot better than Phantom Menace. As an animation buff, I found the CGI effect used on the space ships to be disappointing. In most animated movies, all moving objects are rendered in primary colors while the backrounds are often dense paintings. Titan uses dense rendering on the ships which make them look like they belong in a live action film. Adding insult to injury, ""the making of"" extra feature made it very clear they could have animated the ships with more simple coloring but chose not to, who knows why."
4,Entertained a bunch of 20-ish year olds :),"I'll keep this short and sweet. I got the DVD after I really enjoyed it in the theater. I'm 25. A few days after I got it a bunch of friends came over and we all watched Titan AE. The youngest one in the group was 20. Most of my friends have short attention spans so I was surprized when they watched this movie all the way through, and even commented that it was an awesome film. Any movie that can do this for a bunch of 20 year olds will totally entertain the younger crowd, and likely the older crowd too. :)"
4,Originality lives!!!!!!,"This Don Blueth gem, the former Disney artist, creater of the legendary Secret of Nimth, gives the audience a look at what it would be like for humanity to loose it's home. There are not many movies that you SEE THE EARTH BLOW UP, but this scene haunted me for about a year. Had a vivid dream about a year before this movie came out, and never saw previews of it before i had the dream. This movie is GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, with action adventure and a message of hope. The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is due to the translation of the Nemisis of humanity. These aliens are saying things that were translated in subtitles, not very much to read so i don't understand why it's not included. I have seen this movie about 10 times over the years, it's a great buy to add to your Don Blueth collection. Originality lives!!!!!"
3,"Awesome on the eyes, hard on the brain...","Okay, I love sci-fi. If I could, I would eat, sleep and ... well, you get the idea. I love sci-fi. Correction ... I love *original* sci-fi.Multiple times during this movie, I found myself saying ""Wow"" at the visual wonder that was this film. Just as many times I found myself saying ""Yawn"" at the plot. Hearing the name Joss Whedon attached to the film, I had visions of Buffy-esque plot twists gone sci-fi. Instead, I got a church basement pot luck supper of a plot. By the last twenty minutes, I was naming the movies where I had seen this before. That, in itself, became almost amusing after a while, but that is another story.Look, get it because it is visual eye candy and don't expect much from the plot, and you will be content ... no more, no less."
3,DATED BUT WORTH A LOOK,This film was a financial flop at the box office and probably because it was sold as an adult film and then a film for children. The voices of Matt Damon and Drew Barrymore are the main human voices and yes it's focused on a scion of humans who have lost their planet long ago but the main character has a ring that will help him find the Titan A.E. which is machine that will create a whole new Earth equivalent. But wait there's these energy dudes who hate humans and what they might become so look out. Animation is done classically but some of the dialogue is below par. Interesting range of animal alien characters and the special effects are noticeably good. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B minus to B (but probably higher for its time); OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2011 (streamed).
5,Two thumbs up!,I received this item in great condition in a small amount of time. I'm very pleased with his service!
1,Terrible movie,Watching this was terrible . I started to fall asleep barely half way through. Its just so boring! It was really hard to care about the characters or the story...
2,No comparison to traditional anime.,"I have to say that I am glad I rented this movie instead of buying it as I planned. Disney has nothing to worry about as far as competition goes. The storyline was well-defined but slow. Find the Titan, and what became of its creator, before the boy's enemies destroy it and him. Drew Barrymore had a few good lines, and quick-witted responses, but the people who did the voices would have been better served in a Disney remake of an old classic. Traditional anime is not afraid of nudity or violence, look what they show on Toonami on the Cartoon Network every afternoon. Everything from ""Sailor Moon"", who transforms in the nude in the Japanese version of the show, to ""Big O"" has excessive violence."
2,This movie does not work,"No, I don't mean my dvd player is broken, I mean the whole plot, graphics, voice overs, they're just not that good. Ok half of the graphics are good, but the other half are [not]! If you're going to make a movie for its graphics, don't stick in pratically 2D charictars with 3D backgrounds! But the parts that were 3D were good graphics. As for the plot, it could be better.d with DNA bottles, it is massive, and when he first enters, he has no notion of the DNA. It just looks like gold. FASTINATING. MUST HAVE. FIVE STARS. and may i add, BIG TIME ACTION MOVIE!"
1,Unfortunate,"This movie shows little besides that The Iron Giant was more of an exception than a trend in American animated films. It has little respect for its audience, as it clearly seems to aim squarely for the pre-teen age group. Everything about it seems to scream ""MTV"". The animation seemed cartoonish and very overstated, in typical American style. The movie seems to have originated from marketeers, interested in targeting a very specific demographic, rather than resulting from any particular inspiration or creative vision.I fear that the most unfortunate aspect of this film is that it will serve to reinforce the public's preconceptions about animation, which I beleive explains why Princess Mononoke did so poorly in the US, despite being a big blockbuster in Japan.I had low expectations for this movie, though not quite low enough."
1,*barf hack puke*,"Never mentally fell asleep in a movie as quick as I did with this movie. Talk about a ""look what we can do film"" Story was okie I guess, just glad this is the last film that this animation studio will be releasing....good bye bad rubish!"
3,Ho hum....,"This movie had the potential to be stellar. It had a definitely workable storyline, tremendous animation capabilities, and a decent cast. Unfortunately, the storyline fell short. Don Bluth is, if you have ever watched his movies, known for cutesy, childish characters. In a movie where he is obviously trying to appeal to an older audience, Bluth has problems letting go of the childishness, and sappy happiness. In the right hands, Titan AE would've blown everyone away. It was a good concept, and, overall, entertaining, but inevitably annoying. Sorry."
2,The film that killed Fox Animation Studios,"Titan AE wasn't a BAD movie, there just wasn't much there. When comparisons to Star Wars come up, that probably more becuase of the character inter-relationships and jokes ripped off almost word for word from Empire Strikes Back more than the special effects or anything else.Easter Egg hunters: Check out the Death Star in the exterior shot of the Human Colony.For a movie was was supposedly more 'adult', it was very kid oriented. But it really couldn't decide what it was. The attempt at a hopeful, inspiring ending failed pretty badly. So did the attempts to mix cgi and traditional animation. To me, it just didn't look right.Rent it first, before you make a decision to buy it."
3,"""Stories For Boys""","In the minds of young boys (I'd say between 7 and 14), this movie ranks right up there with Star Wars. It's futuristic, features ""one of their own"", has great special effects. In short, it is a must-buy for this age group. However, (again, like Star Wars), the script is nothing to write home about. Parents will wonder why their sons love it so much. But love it, they do."
1,"Terrible, terrible movie","I'm pretty openminded, but man, this movie really really stunk.Don Bluth hit his peak with Dragon's Lair and The Secret of Nimh."
2,Brat discovers father,"Take a formula story; add celebrity voices to distract you, throw in graphics that you would not know was better if they did not yell it at you every chance they get. And you have Titan A.E.If this is supposed to be 3'D a D is missing. It is slightly better than the standard Anime. They fill in the slow spaces while the graphics are catching up to the story with crude imitations of contemporary bubble gum music.The story is formula. The characters are stilted and the technology is not.This is a very lengthy cartoon. Designed for people that would be better off with a computer game.Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"
2,i was bored,i see that almost everyone but me liked this. oh well everyones differnt. I found the plot boring. the supporting alien chacter weerre ten time more annoying than jar jar binks. in fact in one scene where one of yhis aliens looks like it dead i almost cheered because that would mean no more ofhim and his annoyingness.i do agree that the animation was p[retty neat .
3,Not overly impressed,"This film was not what Iexpected from a major contender like Fox, and if I hadn't already seen good things come out of that studio I probably would never venture to watch one of theirs again.This movie shows that Disney isn't the only ones with computer animation talent, but it shows that at least in this case they lacked the story writing abilities. I do have to give them credit for an original plot. The ending is a massive stretch of the imagination, but any science fiction fan could appreciate that. The music is all rock and helps keep the movie moving."
1,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT...BAD QUALITY","I purchased this beautiful quilted comforter after looking for the perfect quilt to match my decor for approximately 2 months. When I received it, I was so happy that it matched so well and it was absolutely gorgeous. After 1 month, I noticed that some of the stitches were coming apart on the quilted portion of the comforter. I tried to sew it back together, but I noticed that it was coming apart in so many different areas. I have replaced the comforter with one that is not as beautiful, but I will have to pay the drycleaners to reinforce the entire comforter with new stitching. Once again, BEAUTIFUL BUT...BAD QUALITY!"
3,Lacking,"Neher provides a decent overview of Southeast Asia, but anyone with even a scant background in the area will find it to be wholly incomplete. Although not innacurate, Neher's treatemnt of the region and its history is cursory, its numerous deficiencies really are inexcusable for such an author."
4,Best version of Windows for home use.,"For anyone looking for the best operating for their home, I'd recommend this. Most people have been raised on Windows software, and this is the best operating system Microsoft has out. I've tried every version of Windows (except 2000 DataCenter Server, but I have yet to meet someone who has) and this worked the best on my system and my peers systems. Use this OS unless you're more experienced and can handle Linux."
1,Agree with others that Win98 is Less Stable than Win95,"If you have Win95 don't upgrade to Win98 - It is less stable and many of the programs for Win95 just plain do not work. Maybe WinME is better but it is still based on DOS - Microsoft is always announcing that their next version is going to be better -Well, we're are still waiting."
2,Windows 95 bug patch,"Yum... yet another OS from Microsoft that is buggy, unreliable, and causes your system to crash randomly. I can't believe that I actually paid Microsoft for this product - they should be paying me if they want to do their beta testing on customers.Well, horrible architecture aside, the good things about Windows 98 is that it now has USB support, so not all of your dollars went to waste. Oh, and it includes another version of Internet Explorer - a very good product, by the way. Aside from that, if you have to use Windows to play your games, you were warned. I opted out, too frustrated from having to reboot constantly and now vow not to use another OS by this company ever again."
3,Good for home use but not for businesses.,"This Version of Windows 98 certainly gives me headaches when I hibernate with my computer. That is because sometimes it never comes back to it's original state. My computer always crashes, plus I get a lot of error messages. It's high speed, and has a lot of good features including some bug fixes. In other words, this is just for home use and not for business."
1,Hopes dashed.,"With all of the USB devices now available, I needed to upgrade my laptop from Windows 95 to 98. I purchased the upgrade, attempted to load it, and my system froze after an hour's worth of labor loading it. I called Microsoft's help line (a toll call, by the way), and wasted another two hours. The technician told me I needed to update my drivers. I did that, tried to load 98 again (another hour or more), and it failed just the same. This product has cost me more in lost time than the price I paid for it. I will be returning the product."
1,Bill Gates,"Okay...my Win95 is breaking down and unstable...and I feel like I'm being robbed having to buy this enormous, bloated fallacy...thank G-d I have RedHat, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD to work on getting used to instead. Hey...I wish they'd hurry up on that hardware support for *nix so I can remove all Redmond Rubbish from my box."
4,written review,"I have reviewed my item and I liked it, but I'm not able to use it because it's a 98 computer and I need a hard drive put in it, and a mother board. But I will use the software when I get those things put in. Thanks alot."
3,Can You Say REBOOT?,"This is one very unstable operating system! I'm not speaking relatively here, I'm just telling you what I have experienced with Windows 98 Upgrade. First of all, one out of five times when my computer starts I have some kind of error message, often I must reboot. My computer freezes quite frequently as well, when I'm not even running programs. Restarting because of registry is something that happens a lot as well. Whenever I get an error and have to reboot the computer I hold my breath because I just don't know if I will get one of those fatal errors that causes the system to crash (which has happened three times!)After all is said and done, although I do not have it installed, I would go with the full version of Windows 98 SE or Windows 2000 Professional. MS is pretty much a monopoly so u don't have much of a choice, but u really should avoid the Windows 98 Upgrade!"
1,This Software Does NOT work,"My company purchased this upgrade. We installed it on 5 of our PCs. On 2 of the PCs it kept duplicating and creating Temporary Internet subfolders and the cookies inside the folders exponentially locking up the PCs. On the other 3 if you went into explorer and tried to move folders the contents of the folders vanished. They were not in the delete file. They were just gone. On all 5 PCs you may be working and out of the blue you would get a message that said ""You have performed an illegal operation!"" and then the whole PC would lock up and would not respond to the mouse or any of the keys. If your work was not ""saved"" when this happened it was ""lost."" I personally never purchased this upgrade for home use and I never will. It's nothing but trouble."
4,Stick with the full version of Win98/ME,"My computer was made for Win98,but I wanted to test the upgrade on a older Compaq computer with Win95.So I bought a old computer at a computer show,and bought the upgrade of Windows98.It was very hard to upgrade to Windoes98 like the others have said,and once loaded ran worst then the full version that came with my newer computer.So Then I uninstalled the upgrade and installed Windows98SE cleanly from the cd that came with my newer computer.The install from the full cd version was more stable but yeah it still has a few ""normal Windows headaches"".So the bottom line is stick with the full version of Windows98/ME and for Godsake do a clean install!"
2,Expensive bug fix.,"For a company that has enough revenue to run a small country, I expect a lot more for an Operating System. Win98 should have been released as free bug fixes to Win95. The products are extremely similar and contain alot of the same core features. If you can get away with using Win95, it is not worth the upgrade.If you feel pretty confident in your computer skills, buy ReHat Linux!"
4,Worth the money,"If you have Win95 this upgrade is worth the money. Setup is a breeze, the new networking features are nice and the added hardware support out of the box is worth the money alone. All my old apps still run great and they seem to run even faster now (I think they did some work here). No crashes or hangs so far, overall a solid upgrade."
2,Poor poor Microsoft.,"How do you make an OS that in most cases is terrible...worse? You make an even more terrible update.This is a strange case (as is to me with most MS products) as some of the things added when using this update actually make Windows 98 easier to use...while also hogging resources, making the system more unstable and other things that the normal user wouldn't notice but drive me nuts.It is so sad that all the gamers out there must rely on such poor stability to play games that otherwise would be amazing if they didn't have to fight the OS for resources.Alas, in close, Windows is here to stay (Win2K actually looks like a winner though kiddies) so we may as well get used to it. Linux, BeOS, FreeBSD, et al. are newcomers on the block and will steal some of Microsoft's glory but it's going to take many years to knock out all of the companies that rely on being ""Windows Compatible"" to make them money. Yes indeed, it is here to stay."
1,windows 98 upgrade,"I tried to install the 98 upgrade second edition. My windows 95 system would not accept it reading ""must have a 98 system."" I need to get the complete 98 system, I guess.. Help! Help!Anybody"
2,Micro$oft... and thats all...,Its a computer O/S... i really dont like it but because Microsoft is so common and well supported i guess it will have to do... wann hint get a good book and buy linux it wont crash as much... it only gets 2 stars because it has so many programs that work with it.... Its my opinion that this O/S is not worth even 5 cents.
2,Windows 98,This software came in the time it said would arrive. It is great that it was online. It was a great price.
2,"Save your money, its not worth it","This package is another Microsoft cash grab. There was no need to release a whole new version, I'm sure all of the improvements could of been included on a patch which current Windows 98 users could download for free, but nope. If you are looking for a new operating system, I'd suggest buying Windows 2000 if you want the latest and greatest that they have to offer. This is just a waste of money."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"If you have win95, then it might beneficial to upgrade to win98 SE. However, the fact is that there is no difference with win98, with the exception for IE5--which can be attain separately for little or no cost. Most of the drivers and designs are still the same. Furthermore, OS is still crashing as regularly as the old. Currently, I am not even bother to use the win98SE upgrade that I have for my PC."
1,What a load of crap,"I'm a computer builder/repairman. I would not pay for this. If it was as revolutionary as Win95 was over win3.1 then it would be worth it. is a high price to pay for a couple bug fixes. I only hope the law eventually catches up the the master con-man that is Bill Gates. If you have Win95, then you will see a world of improvement, and you will probably think it's worth it. But not because you want it, but because that's the way Bill likes it."
5,Happy Camper,I was very happy with the product and especially with the seller who gave wonderful service and prompt delivery!
3,Beware,"The description of this item incorrectly states ""Platform: Windows 95/Me/98"". This is incorrect. The software in question is an upgrade to Windows 98SE from Windows 3.x and 95 *only*. If you are running Windows 98 or ME, you *cannot* use it to upgrade to Windows 98SE. So beware and get the exactly correct version."
1,Wait for Windows 2000,It is a complete waste of money.Wait for Windows 2000 instead of buying this one.It seems to be an attempt on the part of Microsoft to fill the gap between now and the launch of Windows2000 which has been delayed.
1,BUGS BUGS BUGS,OS upgrades stink. I resisted the upgrade to 98 because I knew it would be a pain in the rear. It was and is... half the time I can't even boot. I was fine until I did the stupid upgrade.
1,Keep your money!!!,"WIN98 SE is only a service pack, with added CAB files and proprietary drivers. It serves ONE purpose, Microsofts ugly lust for more and more money. Since anything you add to your computer comes with newer drivers, and the attempts to patch WIN98 B have only injected more bugs into third party software it's a waste of money and time. Also NT will not support any added hardware but is safe from invasion, so 2000 was created for more versatility with that security. Home users do not want 2000, its security features are detrimental. I needed to correct the mis-info of some other posts."
5,best electric grill,"love the size,perfect for 2 and plugs in on my porch, clean up is a breeze. Priced right, as always, on Amazon.com. Fast delivery"
4,Actually works,Currently living in a condo that does not allow gas or charcoal grills so had to go electric. Past experiences were not very good with other brands but the Meco actually works. Does not get nearly as hot as a gas grill but if you let it heat up for 15 to 20 minutes and do not leave the top open it does a reasonable job. Quick assembly.
1,No heat..Terrible Purchase,What a bad investment we made in our Meco Table Top Grill. It does not get hot enough to sear the meat. Grill looks good but hardly works. We have tried pre-heating for 30-40 minutes but that doesn't help anyone except maybe the electric company. We do not recommend it. The company has no suggestions and we can't return it because we did not keep the box!
4,Best for Apartment Living!,"Easy to carry, assemble, and operate. Instruction manual is thorough, though I didn't expect that it would come almost completely assembled -- that made setting up even faster and easier! I'm not sure why it didn't come with the cookbook it claimed was included, but that's a BIG deal for me, and wasn't happy it was missing.Otherwise, it's everything the manufacturer states; the grill marks on the burgers were there, the smell of grilled meat without the worry of carcinogens from charcoal. Quick to heat up and cool down. Definitely follow the instructions for first-time use and suggested temperatures for cooking to get the best results. I was never a fan of messing with gas grills, and since almost all apartment complexes don't allow charcoal grills on your balcony, this is THE BEST alternative.Happy Grilling!!"
2,OK for small meats,"Unit does not get hot enough to cook big steaks (1.5 inch, 1 pound) well unless you like well done and are willing to wait a long time to cook it. We live in a condo and can't do charcoal or propane, so this electric is the only viable alternative. It's definitely marginal!!"
4,Not A Bad Grill For An Electric,"I gave this grill to my son who cannot have an open flame on his apartment patio. I never thought much about electric grills. Always thought gas was the best for cooking. However, my son says he's very pleased with this grill. It heats up fast and cooks to perfection. It feels substantial and well made except for the base, which could be a little bigger for more stability. If you need or want to BBQ with electric, you should be happy with this grill. Very little assembly.Meco 9300 Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill, Satin Black"
2,Started out strong then fell flat,"Being a fan of time travel romance, I was excited to find a book that wasn't involved with Highlanders and Scotland. In my opinion this ""romance"" is pretty tame, as there wasn't a lot of romance involved and maybe one steamy scene between the two main characters. **SPOILER** The scene in which Jocelyn and Garren finally sleep together is so glossed over, I had to go back and forth and reread because I wasn't even sure if they did have sex. It also irritated me how much Jocelyn was insecure about her body and how she had to workout all the time. I get it, she was overweight growing up and worked hard to slim down and is insecure, but the way it was written just did not endear her to me. The ending also felt very rushed. I feel like this book had so much potential to be great, but it just didn't measure up. Sad to say I had to give it two stars."
5,Clever!,Virginia Farmer has found a new twist for time travel that is not to be missed. This award-winning author is on her way to the top!
1,The Sixpence Bride,"This book was highly recomended to me, unfortunately it was so slow and boring! The main character of Jocelyn was so scared to believe she had time traveled, then suddenly she has perfectly adjusted to the 18th century. Everyone loves her, though we never understan exactly why because they think shes crazy. This is one of those books you start and put down unfortunately I didn't I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't. Save you time and money."
4,Good Read,"This was my first Victoria Alexander, and I am happy to say, not my last. I really enjoyed the heroine being more independent and assertive. I reread the fencing scene at the end a couple of times, it was so good. It turns out, this was four different love stories in one book - for Pamela, Aunt Millicent, Clarissa, and Valentine, each with its own humor and sweetness. I would highly recommend this as a good romance read."
2,"Painfully slow, uneventful book","Had I not read other books by Victoria Alexander this would put me off her altogether. I am SOOO disappointed! Practically nothing happens. It was slow, painful to read and very boring!"
2,Disappointment,This sequel had so much potential. The secondary characters were great but the story line for the main characters was completely lacking. I purchased this book because I love Victoria Alexander novels. I even rushed to read this book prior to other books I have waiting to be read.This book gave me the impression Ms Alexander was rushed to meet a deadline. She needed to development the main characters more.
5,At My Wits End With My Hair,"BUY THIS BOOK!!!This is a great book! I bought this book and Curly Girl at the same time. This one was the best hands down. It has changed my life and now finally I have the tools to deal with my hair. Yes, she does talk about her own products, but you don't need them. I got the same results from using good products I bought at the local beauty supply store. Wonderful advice! Excellent hair nutrition guide. My hair has never looked and felt so healthy and alive. Finally, a hair guide us forgotten people with truely curly hair. You don't have to wonder if those magical hair treatments that your hair dresser is trying to sell you this week, are going to work finally. This book tells you everything that your hair needs and the chemicals and goop to look out for.If you know anyone with bad frizzy, curly hair GET THIS BOOK!!! It will change their lives."
5,Lets talk about curls,"This book has inspired me to take another look at my curly hair. Through years of ironing my hair, perming, reverse perming, straightening, etc, I have learned to take another look at my curls, and really try to make them work.I laughed when I read the ""Less is more"" idea. I always put globs of product on my hair, and it always comes out aweful. I cut down the amount I put in, and worked it in better, and it came out great.This is a must buy!"
3,good basic curly hair info,"Gave a nice overview of curly hair, for those who are at a loss of how to manage and care for their curls. Most of the information presented I already knew from web searches on curly hair. It's a good ""one stop"" book for those who don't want to spend the time diong internet searches."
2,Not worth the time to read,This book was mostly pointless. If you have curly hair you already know most of what is talked about. I wasn't impressed.
2,Very Ordinary,"This book didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know about hair care just from owning curly hair and wearing it curly for the last 23 years. The directions for making the hairstyles were very difficult to follow - I saw a hairstyle in the book and tried to duplicate it, but the instructions Ouidad had given confused me and the style didn't turn out. It kind of bothered me that she gave instructions for straightening hair. I want to make my curls look better, not damage my precious hair with straightening treatments! Overall, I was bored and annoyed with this book. Curly Girl is a lot better."
2,A paperback infomercial,"What a waste of time. If I wanted to buy overpriced products, I'd hit the mall. If I wanted to read some really silly testimonials, I'd buy a copy of The National Enquirer. Ouidad provided minimal information sandwiched between shameless self-promotion.Curly Girl, by Lorraine Massey, is a better choice."
1,sorry Ouidad :(,"I love Ouidad products, but I would not buy this book again. It really was just one big adertisement for Ouidad products.Don't get me wrong, I love what Ouidad does for my hair. I always get tons of compliments when I use their Deep Treatment but as far as books go, getCurly Girlinstead. Lorraine Massey is solely interested in promoting beautiful curly hair, not just her product line.There's also a newer curly hair line called JessiCurl. It's my new favorite.I say skip this book and invest in some product that will enhance your curls. I've tried Ouidad, Deva Curl and Jessicurl and they're all wonderful."
3,"Forget the book, try the products","I love Ouidad Deep Treatment as a deep conditioner and all of the other Ouidad products that I have tried; however, this book isn't all that helpful. For real help with curly hair, skip this book and spend your book money on Ouidad products. If you want a book about curly hair worth buying, buy Curly Girl by Massey."
4,"Joan, Jack, Ralph",I search of a jewel for a new book. They travel to many lands for it. And romance too.
4,The surprises keep coming.,"Not as brilliant as Romancing the Stone but The Jewel of the Nile is still quite enjoyable sequel. Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny Devito are back in this action-packed thrill ride, Jack and Joan are sharing their life on a sail boat and some unexpected things start to occur on dry land. I don't want to give away too much but if you like romance and action then The Jewel of the Nile is right up your alley. Happy viewing!"

4,Fun movie !,"Romancing The stone probably is a better movie as it is more exciting but its sequel ""The Jewel Of the Nile"" is every bit as entertaining. 3 principle stars (Douglas, Turner, DeVito) are all wonderful. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the DVD short comings. No Dolby 5.1 and the picture quality is below averae. A remastered edition probably is unlikely so grab this one as Fox already dropped its retail price from ..."
2,"Entertaining, but uneven","Sequel to the somewhat-thrilling ""Romancing the Stone"", this movie was more entertainment than adventure tale. It starts off well enough, with another of Joan Wilder's romantic tales, and segues to real-life where Joan and Jack are taking the cruise they promised each other at the end of ""Romancing the Stone"". From there the tale is fairly predicatable, and there are some action shots that will make you groan (the scene with the jet fighter is a particular groaner), but there are enough highlights to make the effort worthwhile. Danny DeVitto is terrific in this film and provides some much-needed comic relief in just the right spots."
3,"Fun, but not up to the level","of Romancing the Stone.While the chemistry is there between the principal characters, the plot is just ...thing and has moments that are forced for some over the top action and little substance."
1,A prime example of Why Sequels Are a Bad Idea,"While I could pick at one or two points about ""Romancing the Stone"", there's no reason to; it was a positively delightful and enjoyable film in every respect. A real gem (no pun intended, of course).But ""Jewel"" had absolutely none of the charm of its predecessor. ""Romancing..."" ended exactly where it should have ended -- what a misguided thought it was to pick up the story after the ""happily ever after"" ending of the first film. Some stories just end where they're supposed to end; with Scarlett O'Hara losing Rhett; with Rick Blaine nobly giving up Ilsa for a greater good; with Atticus sitting up in Jem's bedroom while Jem sleeps. Sequels for any of these would be a travesty (sadly, it's happened anyway for a couple of them). While ""Romancing..."" is not on a par with these books and movies, it nevertheless ended in a very appropriate way, and it's a shame it wasn't left there."
4,Great Classic on the perfect format,"This is a great classic Michael Douglas film. It looks the best it ever has on the blu ray format. The picture quality isn't as good as other blu ray movies from the same era, but it is much better than the dvd version. So if you are a fan of this movie definitely pick up this version."
2,"Skip this one. Just watch ""Romancing the Stone"" again.","Not too bad for a sequel, but this film has absolutely none of the ""magic"" of the original. Everything seems forced, contrived, and artificial by comparison. As others have noted, the story ended precisely where it should have at the close of ""Romancing the Stone."" Too bad they did not leave well enough alone."
2,2 1/2 stars for a lame sequel,"Following the footsteps of ""Romancing the Stone"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, it's easy to understand why the series stopped here. In the previous film, lightweight though it may be, there is no question that the chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner helps make it fun to watch. Not so here. This is essentially a lame attempt at comedy with some ludicrous adventure thrown in. Poorly written it doesn't work very well. I can't totally dismiss it, because of Douglas and Turner but come on."
4,Pleasing sequal,"Jewel of the Nile is not as funny and entertaining as Romancing the stone, but it does provide good action, good acting and lots of laughs and entertainment. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone looking for a couple of hours of adventure!"
3,The Jewel of the Nile,"Definitely not as good as the first, but still worth watching. I loved Romancing the Stone, and seeing what comes after Joan's ""happily ever after"" was fun."
4,A Great Movie!,"This move is great! It's not as good as the first movie, ""Romancing the Stone"", but this one comes in close! Danny Devito plays the role of Ralph wonderfully! I even got my brother hooked on the movie!"
4,Not Too Bad For A Sequel,"THE JEWEL OF THE NILE is a sequel to ROMANCING THE STONE. The director and the screenwriters are new but Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito are back in their old familiar roles. The cast also includes Spiros Focas and Avner Eisenberg.This time the adventure takes place in North Africa where Turner is invited to accompany a wealthy Arab to his own country. She soon finds herself caught in another big mess in a very strange land. Naturally Douglas has to rescue her as he did before in ROMANCING THE STONE.Danny DeVito's best scene comes near the beginning of the film when he suddenly emerges from a barrel on a dock with a rapid-fire description of his experiences in a Columbian jail. On balance JEWEL OF THE NILE is an entertaining movie but it does not quite recapture the magic of ROMANCING THE STONE."
2,eeckk,"this movie was ecky. it was all about some muslim African dictator and the abuses of his people. and of course there had to be a rebellious faction that was trying to over throw him. this had nothing to do with Romancing the Stone with the exception of having the same 3 characters. and perhaps seeing this back in the 80s when it came out it might have a hint of something new . . . after 9/11 and Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and Egypt and Yemen and Iran and Syria and Lebananon and Kuwait. . . I am not interested in this movie, its subject or its setting."
4,Romancing The Stone 2: The Jewel Of The Nile,"Okay, now I have no doubt that this is going to annoy some people and seem petty but the title of this one really annoys me as a collector. Putting this in alphabetical order in my collection really throws it off. Putting it alphabetically where it goes is no less annoying. It should have been called, ""Romancing The Stone 2: The Jewel Of The Nile"" but wasn't. Douglas and Turner are super in the characters, the story isn't a bad one and DeVito is always a thrill to watch. But it just does not compare to the original film. In this one Turner's character is invited to join the future leader of his people after having a fallout with her beau. But Douglas' Jack must come to the rescue when tales of the Jewel Of The Nile and fear of his lady come into play. DeVito and Douglas must make an uneasy truce in hopes of recovering the jewel and rescuing the lady. If you own the first you might want this one, just put it under ""R""."
1,NOT SO GOOD,"Hi, this battery is not well recognise by the camera.A message alert appears on the screen about the lit ion and each timeI have to restart the camera after it shut down by itselfe."
5,Frank and Bing were a great duo,"Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra were great together as well as individually, and this CD proves it once more. With many of the great Christmas standards here, this CD makes for terrific listening."
3,Sinatra and Cosby Christmas cd,"This cd does not automatically play the songs as listed. If you manually move it from song to song, it plays in the correct order. Otherwise, it plays randomly, sometimes songs over and over."
3,Its decent,"I liked this dvd but I have to say I wasn't too fond of the video quality. Plus, it would've been nice to seen more interactive camera angles to this particular dvd. The bonus features were convenient. Anyways, thats what I got off the top of my head."
5,"fascinating, absorbing first-rate murder mystery","Jan Henderson's 'Speeding Bullett' is a an absorbing, fascinating, first-rate murder mystery about the life and strange death of the actor George Reeves, star of 'THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN'. Fans of the classic television series and afficionados of true-life mysteries will not want to miss this page-turner.!"
1,Big Disappointment,"What a disappointment. I'm sure Mr. Henderson is an expert on his subject, and certainly there's an interesting book to be written about what may or may not have happened to George Reeves, but this is most definitely not it. This is a work desperately in need of an editor. It is filled with cliches, awkward construction and just plain bad writing. I would quote you some examples, but I gave the book away as soon as I finished it. Really, don't bother. And whatever you do, don't pay an inflated price for it."
3,It's a good Primer,"I have read three books on Online auctions so far (""Getting started in internet auctions""; ""Confessions of an Internet Auction Junkie"": and this book). I have to admit that I prefer ""confessions over the other two. This book is good for someone thinking about or in the early stages of planning a Internet auction business.The biggest draw back about all of the ""Auction"" books is the lack of information on how to structure the business. I really would like to know what to name a business such as this? What form of business is common...LLC, Inc., or what. I came away with a lot of questions. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book. It just left me wanting more. That's why I gave it three stars."
4,A Best Buy,Here a book that can inform you on what you should do and the things you need to know in order to get your online auction business up and going
1,good product poor customer care,"I like the product and the gel does wonders for my feet, however, I order mesh tubes that I could cut to fit and they sent me individual toe wraps which are too large for my small toes. I was not happy !!"
1,Omerta,"Its sad to say a big compagny like Amazon makes these mistakes not once but twice. I ordered The last chapter english with french subs and also Omert but both products where just englisch no subs at all. After i was glad finaly found where i was looking for so long i was realy sad finding out it was all i big bang. Payed al lot of monney shipping etc etc and did not even got 1 produckt i ordered.Still waiting on a refund and new products still thinking Amazon has them as they say, for now i am not happy with all they prommis."
4,Very useful but not perfect,"This book series indexes passenger arrival lists from US ports, giving names, ages, occupations, and sometimes places of origin for many German immigrants, grouped by families. It also lists the ship, ports, and the date of the passenger ship list. The quality of the transcription varies, and because of its inclusion criteria, it is to be considered an incomplete index to German passengers, but it still can be quite useful. Make sure you consult the original passenger lists also, because they often contain interesting and useful information not listed in the Germans to America books."
4,Good product,"I bought two of these, one for the front and one for the rear of the house. They are connected to 3/4 PEX and I would have preferred if the valves were 3/4"" as well. They seem more like 1/2"" judging by the flow but it's not a significant problem. A 1"" bit is all you need for the rough-in hole. The only other thing I can say is one of the two valves turns harder than the other. I took it apart and lubed it to try and make it turn smoother but that had no effect. It could be a QC issue but again, it don't consider it a significant problem."
3,gets the job done,"This sillcock creates a lot of vibration and noise from the anti siphon when you are turning it on. Also, the handle does not screw in tight and constantly needs to be tightened as the screw comes loose. I wish I had bought one that had a 1/4 turn on and off where this one takes over a full turn to get water running full stream."
1,junk,"I bought this with two expansion handsets 6 months ago. The ""on"" button stopped working (can't answer or call out). Swapped it with another handset and the 1 doesn't work on that. Two down , now the last one won't answer or pick up either. Three phones, none work. Am shipping to Motorola at my expense for repair."
2,Fabulous except it doesn't work,"Pros: These phones are very cool, I hated taking them back. The list of features is the best of any multi-handset system and the product design is stunning. The intercom function is outstanding. This is the only phone/intercom system where you can dial another handset -- have the other handset automatically pickup -- and switch to speakerphone so you can tell the kids in the basement dinner is ready.Cons: The phones don't work. The sound quality when used as a regular phone is terrible and the speakerphone isn't that loud either (what can you expect from a tiny speaker). Worst of all the battery needs to be charged several times a day.I purchased a Radio Shack model that is half is cool, but the sound is great and the batteries last forever (or at least 4 or 5 days with frequent use)."
2,"Great features, poor quality","I really like the design of this phone and the features it offers. I found it easy to configure and use. You can put 4 AAA batteries in the base station to keep it going through a power failure. However, the audio quality on both the answering machine and the handset is terrible. Messages that are left are barely intelligible. If the person you're talking to is speaking LOUDLY, then audio quality is acceptable, although there is some static. If the other person isn't loud, though, it requires a lot of concentration to listen to them.No doubt part of my problem is that I also have a wireless LAN, which shares the 2.4GHz frequency. If my laptop is on and communicating with the wireless LAN, the phone becomes unusable, even though the phone base station and the LAN base station are at opposite ends of the house *and* on different floors!I've been a long time fan of Motorola products, but this is one that I'm going to be returning."
2,Short Battery Life,"The phone is great except for the battery life. It is very clear, and the hands free option is wonderful. I really like the ability to add additional handsets so you do not need a phone jack in every room. Well, it's been a month and my additional handset does not even stay charged for 24hrs. This is without talking on the phone. If you talk on the phone, good luck running to your second handset. I guess this is why they added the feature to transfer your call to another handset. Trust me, you will need it. I had never had a cordless phone that has such a short battery life. It's such a shame because everything else about the phone is great. Too bad I ALWAYS have to place the phone back on the charger after a phone call or risk the phone turning off due to the short battery life."
3,Broke in 32 days!,"When I got this phone, I loved it. It has different rings, intercom, hands free, etc... I replaced all the phones in my house with the expandable phones that you can purchase. I spent alot of money doing this. After a little over a month, the ""on"" button on the phone stopped working. I tried returning it to the store, it was over a month since I had purchased it, so they told me to go to Motorola. Motorola told me to send in the whole phone, charger and all in to Motorola. Shipping paid by me. Now the other phones in my house are useless until I get the replacement in from the company. I hope this helps! Good luck!"
2,Don't buy this phone.,"I bought this phone due to the ability to conference other wireless phones by using the intercom feature. That works great!Now, for the bad points. The numbers on the phone become unresponsive and are very difficult to press. Also, the battery life is terrible. In addition, the answering machine has several quirks that are annoying. You can't delete a message until the voice stops introducing the message. In addition, the volume is either way too high or too low with a given setting."
4,Excellent,Bought this phone for Christmas with an expansion handset. So far so good. Both handsets are clear and the shared phonebook is very handy. Menus are well thought out and phone features are easily accessible. Most impressive is the clarity of the speakerphone built into each handset. This is a must have for people suffering from RSI or carpal tunnel syndrome.
1,Not Buying this Product,"First of all, thank you so much to all of the reviewers for their honest comment about this product. The phone looks really cool and I almost bought it, until finally i decided what others have to say about this product. After reviewing the comments, I absolutely change my mind not to buy this phone. I would rather go with non fancy looking phone but a working one. Thank you for saving my money, and the hassle that I might have to face with this phone."
2,An okay phone if you don't talk long.,I've had this phone for 6 months. The reception and features are great. It would be nice if you didn't need to program info on both the phone and base separatlty though. The biggest problems are that the shape of the phone hurts your ear after a few seconds of use and the battery life is horrable. My old corless AT&T from 1992 lasts me a week off the hook. This one lasts 1-2 days. So much for technology! My 1992 AT&T is still in perfect working order. We'll see about this one.
2,"Good features, poor quality","I purchased this phone because it had ALL the features I wanted, especially the base speaker phone and how you could set different ringing volumes on each of the handsets different based on the time of day. But the problems of this phone definitely outweigh its features. The handset speaker quality is sketchy - there's always a lot of static. I usually can't hear up to half of the answering machine messages due to poor quality, even with the volume turned all up. And its impossible to tell if there are old messages saved (so if your roommate already listened to them, and there's a new one for you, you have no way to know). When retrieving messages remotely, I usually have to call back 3 times before the pass code is accepted (I think due to the same answering machine volume issue). I'm generally sorry I purchased this set."
1,"Great features, lousy handset!","The handset is no longer usable - the buttons simply don't connect any more - there doesn't seem to be any way to get a replacement handset! Still, I got two years out of my purchase which is long than some of the other reviewers."
3,A thirty-something comes of age,"With some qualification, I enjoyed this novel about a youngish gay man (Sam) with some personal and professional issues to cope with. The book's strongest moments are spent at the Washington zoo, where Sam's job as a keeper and his relationships with colleagues are described with passion and compassion by the author. When Sam isn't at work, his personal life sags and so does the reader's interest in him. It's hard to muster much sympathy for his problems of self-esteem and with relationships. The author has done too good a job of presenting Sam as an attractive, intelligent and confident guy. Nevertheless, this is a highly readable story and even though you might want to give the protagonist a good shake and loud ""get over it!"", you still care about him through to the end. Alex MacLennan writes well and I will happily give his next novel a try."
3,mostly a good read,"I had heard good things about this book and picked it up to read. For the most part I ended up enjoying it, which is surprising as Alyson can sure publish crappy books. Sam the main character of the book is the monkey keeper at the DC Zoo and his life is stuck in a rut. He thinks he's found the man of his dreams in Dean, a semi-closeted local news anchor, but Dean is just the first step in Sam awakening from the cocoon of a life he has created with his best friend Laurel and his sister (who got pregnant at 16). The writing style is fluid and interesting and MacLennan has created some interesting characters scattered throughout the book. Though I do wish it was edited down a bit as some scenes did drag on, plus Sam's own thick headedness about his life's direction started to grate towards the middle of the book, which is why only the 3 stars. Overall I look forward to seeing what this author has next to read."
2,Good only for a few accent banners,"While the designs shown are very impressive, this book does not offer a very comprehensive selection. If you are looking to spice up your banner selection with a few new ideas, then this might be a great book for you (there's a beautiful baptism banner design). But if you are looking to make quite a few banners or have a specific need in miind, this book is very limiting (for example, there are no designs provided for the Lenten season)."
1,Not enough selection,"Had I been able to view this book before I purchased it, I would not have bought it. There's only a few banners shown and the artwork is too detailed for sewing."
1,not as good,I should of read these reviews before buying. Most about current quality are spot on. New 1 is so flimsy compared to my old 1. Much cheaper quality!!!
1,Either I'm an IDIOT or this Grill hates me!,"Day 3: I never thought I was an Idiot, but this grill has changed my mind, husband said just send back. Still not assembled. Old one lasted years, could not have been this difficult to assembly. Loved old one, ordered this, arrived quickly, good price, is taking forever to put together. Why can't wheels have cotter pins, instead of something that has to be pounded? Why doesn't right handed adjusting rod go flat (yes, in right side)? Why don't the screws go into wood slats? Why was the rack already scratched upon arrival? All I needed was ash dump and was too cheap to pay $10 postage on $17 purchase...IDIOT!"
1,Amazon uses bait and switch.,Meco grills are great. Amazon sold me a series 4100 model 4106. sent a model 4100 {no side tables}.I have no problem with Meco. Huge problem with Amazon. My first and last purchase from Amazon. Take my name off your email list.
2,"Nice features, but poor hardware","I like this grill. It has an adjustable grate and a removable ash pan. The down side is that the manufacturer decided that it would only furnish stove bolts and nuts for assembly. The hinges and ""air-sliders"" require acorn, or locking, nuts. I called the customer service number in the manual and was told that theydecided to eliminate the locking-style nuts, but assured me that they would send me the 13 nuts that I needed. That never happened, so I had to buy my own and ended up double-nutting the bolts that require movement. I'd have given 5 stars, because it is a real nice, value-priced grill, but the customer service/engineering fell short."
2,missing parts,"I don't want to mail back the entire item, but there seems to be no other way to correct missing assembly pieces. There are no acorn locknuts -- listed as included parts and needed for assembling the grill. We're going to buy the 13 needed locknuts instead of mailing back the whole thing, waiting for a new one, and probably ending up with the same diminished set of parts. So far we're really disappointed because instead of being able to build and use it when it arrived, it's sitting in pieces on the floor waiting for us to go out to a hardware store."
4,Very nice grill,Right price for a charcoal grill. Took a couple of hours to put together. Wooden side shelves are nice but not sure if they will last. We will see.
3,meco grill,"Meco sends you 4 copies of the assembly instructions: 1 each in German, French, Spanish, and another foreign language. But none in English. I don't think anyone can put this thing together without assembly instructions. Better think twice before ordering one."
2,I hope the bottom does not fall out,I am very disappointed with this grill. After it taking forever to put together....I was impressed with the look BUT after I BBQ for the family for Easter the paint has started to peel off the bottom of the grill. I have never experienced this with any grills and I purchase a new grill every year. I would advise another brand name and staying away from the cheaply made Meco Series. If the bottom falls out I will be returning it because I paid way too much for this grill for it to look ugly after the first use. Very disappointed...especially during a Holiday
5,Meco Charcoal Grill,I like this BBQ grill. This is one of the best ones on the market. This was shipped in fast time.
3,Worthy Companion Piece,"Minus the superfluous album version edit of ""Awfully Deep,"" you've got one new song, one live-studio reworking of the near title track with a little help from Gorillaz collaborator Damon Albarn, and a remix of each. The Albarn/Lampeth Blues version benefits greatly from the Blur kingpin's addition of a brooding piano as well as Rodney's more contemplative delivery. Joseph Mount's Metronomy remix of Damon's jam takes the cut back to an early eighties cheese-funk which kinda misses the point but Diplo's remix of the previously unreleased ""Seat Yourself"" recovers to a more appropriate sludgy bangin' vibe. All in all, it's a worthwhile companion to the full length of the not quite same name."
1,Full of untruths. I am a decent of the Sanks Family. WE ALWAYS KNEW of SANKSVILLE. We grew up there. LIES.,THE AUTHOR IMPLIED THAT SANKSVILLE WAS SOME LOST CITY.. IT MADE MY BLOOD BOIL; CALLING THE PUBLISHER AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.
5,Your Personal Reality Determines What Is True For You,"I read the book at the same time I was getting to know the author personally in Costa Rica. The book would lead one to believe the author is 'way out there', but in actual fact he is quite grounded, level headed, and intelectual. What impressed me about the book is his general style of writing where he said things to the effect that 'this will be true for you'...'or not'. The bottom line is that we all have choices. Choices to believe or not to believe. And that is the essence of our existence - what we ultimately BELIEVE to be true, IS true."
2,Historical Accuracy?,"It's an OK story. Worth reading. As to its historical accuracy, it is a novel which is a work of fiction. Most historical novels are not accurate--the novelist just takes a place and point in time and uses it to tell his/her story. Whether or not it is historical accurate isn't an issue-it is fiction."
5,Classic & Fantastic,"The Living Reed is, or will be, a classic. Pearl Buck intricately weaves the real history of the region, which I have studied for decades, into the fictional lives of the Koreans of the period. Yet, while giving us a glimpse of the everyday drama of the characters, the reader remains focused on the story line--the back drop of the complex political machinations that affected the lives of all."
5,Wow,"Since living in South Korea for the last 4 1/2 years, I found I understood the book a lot better than I would have before this but still found things that helped me understand the people better."
2,What a Shame,I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again.
5,AITF Season 3,"In Mike's Appendix,the episode where Archie says Doctors wear masks is because they steal from people,when they operate."
1,Substandard Video Capture,I recently purchased the Zio Corp Real Time Video TRNSFR -Vid to DVD capture card.After using for only a few days I immediately uninstalled it I had been using it primarily to capture video from my vcr. While some of the video looked good after capture other shots did not there were freezing problems and dropped frames. If you are looking for a video capture device to capture home video from you vcr or camera this is not the product you should even consider giving a second glance too.Look around for something more reliable and stable.
2,Less than expected,"The product is just OK. It is not compatible with Vista so I had to install it on an older, slower system running XP. Tried to install it on a newer faster machine running Win7 and it locked the machine up. Called support and they recommended a newer version of the software. Downloaded it and it still would not run. So if you have an old XP machine with lots of ram and lots of space on your hard drive this will work OK. It is not difficult to use and is somewhat intuitive."
5,Real,"After listening to a lecture that Kevin gave here at Auburn University, I immediately bought his book the same night. After reading the book in two nights, I wanted to call him up and thank him for writing my biography. His stories were real, so real that they brought back memories. His letters were touching, so touching that I cried, laughed and cried again. His words were so vivid, I could close my eyes and see what was going on. This book is a must read for any young urban african american male, and for anyone who wants to understand them."
4,Good insight from a young black author.,"In a time when young Black men throw up the saying ""Keeping it Real"", as an expression of ones ""blackness"", as well as manhood, Kevin puts an end to this expression through his insight. I think his thoughts were well put...perhaps the reviewer that commented earlier from GA, did not experience the same live as Kevin Powell and lived a life of priveledge, nevertheless, it is ashame that he did not accept Kevin's viewpoint. I do not agree with all Black opinion, but no ONE Black persons speaks for us all!!!"
1,"Great series, ridiculous Geneon prices","I love this series, but Geneon's prices are outrageous. They have long ripped us off with over-priced DVDs and they are doing the same with UMDs. Why would I pay over $10 for two episodes?"
4,Back on track. This album rocks,"Oh yeah! When Refresh the Demon starts you know you made a good purcahse. One of the best Annihilator songs right of the bat, but wait, it keeps going, Pastor of Disastor has to be one of the top 5 Annihilator songs of all time and Ultraparanoia, Awaken, Syn Kill 1 and The Box are all great. A Man Called Nothing really works well and it's definately a great song. I even dig Innocent Eyes, it's a great reflection of Jeff's honesty in his music.The album isn't perfect, the crappy City of Ice and Anything for Money really don't fit on this rather heavy album.Another Jeff solo project, but a definate improvement over King of the Kill.Definately add this to your collection"
4,good tunes,"one thing that amazes me about jeff waters is his drive to continue no matter the situation ....... even if he had to do everything solo (remains). i love his voice and guitar work on this album, still has the early thrash feel before the circuis diablo years which are great in their own right ....... but feels like a whole different band. highlights are the title track, syn. kill 1, ultraparanoia and city of ice.if u love annihilators early efforts this is a must have."
5,Everly Brothers - Still the greatest!,"I had this CD a number of years ago, but it got lost during one of my moves. It is still one of my favorites. It's amazing that the clarity is so fantastic, better than the original, I think."
2,How to Kill A Good Book,"First, start with some cool characters, a fun setting, a great topic (who doesn't love rock stars??) Spice it up with an edgy romance. Toss in some reference to awesome music like Depeche Mode, the Cure, and Jeff Buckley. Then have your character do something completely unbelievable - for shock value, for plot enhancement, and not for truth of story. Congratulations! You have killed your book!Sorry, I couldn't look past the completely ridiculous plot twist that made absolutely no sense whatsoever in terms of character. Especially considering the themes of art and truth that ran throughout the book, this just couldn't be forgiven.The one good thing I can say is that if reading this book makes someone go buy a CD of one of the aforementioned artists, then I guess reading it was worth it."
5,Loved It!!!,I have recommended this to several friends and family.. I am not very articulate so all I can say is this is Very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!!!
3,Empty Calories,"Light and fun read. More an appetizer than a meal.The heroine, Eliza, lives a rock and roll fairytale which is maybe why I didn't love this book as much as I wanted to. She has magical powers of seduction which makes both a rock star and a star on the rise fall desperately in love with her, writing songs about her. Both are willing to give up everything and everyone else to be with her. When does that ever happen?The ending left me cold."
5,Read it. ALLLLL of it.,"A fascinating view of the music industry, the struggles and sacrifices made by the musicians, and the expansive impact this lifestyle has on family and friends. The story focuses on an up-and-coming rock star and his trials of love and despair. In light of the title, I threw my Kindle around the 80% completion mark. Thank Christ I picked it back up and finished it. *dashing tears*"
5,This is a great story.,I love this story. Any story that brings me to tears is something to behold. I love a story that can make you FEEL what the characters feel. I was not sure if I wanted to read this story because it doesn't have a large review rating but let me just say that it is well worth the risk. I was not disappointed! Great read.
4,An emotional train wreck...,I read this book months ago and yet I still find myself thinking about it often. Its actually pretty hard for me to write a review. It is so different compared to other similiar love triangle/rock star stories out there. This book is pretty long and even though I couldnt put it down I HAD to take a few breaks from it because it was so intense and I felt sucked right in. If your going to read it just be prepared to be emotional exhausted and heart broken but dont give up on it...Its worth it.
1,Not what I was expecting,Had a hard time keeping up with whose point of view the story was coming from. The book went slow for the first part and not enough at the end. Just not what I was expecting.
5,A Neverending Love Story.,"I couldn't put this book down. I finished all 415 pages of it under 24 hours. The story between Paul and Eliza is endearing. I loved Eliza's character and her overwhelming desire to ""kick"" people when they're being stupid. Debartolo wrote the characters in a heartwarming and endearing way, and was able to give them the ""real"" side to humans that gets down to the gritty part of the rock n' roll universe. The changing perspective between Eliza and Paul, eventually Loring and Michael was also a nice touch because you got to see things from a third person perspective. Amazing book if you like rock and roll and love stories that sometimes don't always have a happy ending, even when you think they should."
4,Gotta love rock and roll,"I've been sick the last few days, so having just bought this book was a godsend! I couldn't put it down. Being a rock and roll fiend, I totally relate to the characters in the book, and I feel reassured that I'm not alone! The only bit I couldn't quite get was what was so great about Eliza that caused everybody to lose their $@!% over her? Maybe I was just jealous! Anyway, I do recommend this book - grittier than your usual love story, sexy characters, and I enjoyed being in their rockin' and lovin' world. Kudos!!!"
1,what a disappointment,"As someone who loved Debartolo's book 'God-Shaped Hole', I am warning you...this book is not of the same caliber whatsoever. It's not horrible, but if you go in with high expectations I guarantee you'll be sorely disappointed. The supposed heroine, Eliza Caelum, is particularly tiresome. Get ready for 400+ pages with endless descriptions of how she lowers her chin and blinks her pretty eyes heavenward..."
5,This Rocks Your Socks Off!!,"GODDAMN Incredible!!! My heart is a turmoil of emotions. Speechless. The beginning was a tad bit slow, but every single page after, made up for it. Poetically fabulous and the writers words are Flawless!!Read this NOW!!Love Love Tiffanie DeBartolo!!"
2,i didn't much like it,"I know William Jay Smith is a respected poet, but I found his poems to be lacking something. His style seems to be stuck in adult mode, but with children's-poem-style. I'm probably not making myself very clear here, but I didn't find myself hating the book. I just didn't like it, and keep seem to work myself up into saying much about the book. And that should say it all."
5,Best air mattress for the money!,"I have owned many air mattresses in my time....aerobeds, etc. I have bought top of the line and bottom of the line. This bed by far is the best bed for the money. The pillow top makes it more like a real mattress...our guests are beyond comfortable. I am so happy with this air bed, I highly recommend it. I plan on purchasing another one for travel that's how much I enjoy this one."
4,"THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT!","Who would have ever thought that TERENCE STAMP would have a hit film in which he played a DRAG QUEEN? Not me! Not you! Not anybody! There are a trio of Drag Queens, in fact, who are racing their way across the AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK to put on a show! We are talking ELABORATE COSTUMES! We are talking CAMP CHOREOGRAPHY to some delicious LIP SYNCH NUMBERS from ABBA! The Village People! Gloria Gaynor! This down under comedy from 1994 directed by STEPHEN ELLIOTT, is certainly a campy cult classic. But as Drew Carey has already shown us, ""Priscilla"" might be good, but it ain't ""Rocky""!"
5,I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS LATEST SEPT. RELEASE!!!,"tHIS IS NOT A REVIEW ALTHOUH I DO OWN THIS MOVIE ON VHS AND AM ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO SEE A DELUXE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ON DVD AS REVIEWED BY THE CUSTOMER IN AUSTRALIA. THE LATEST RELEASE IN SEPT. OF PRISCILLA IS NOT LISTED BY AMAZON AS A SPECIAL EDITION OR NOR DOES IT LIST ANY SPECIAL FEATURES. IF ANY OF YOU LATTER REVIEWERS BOUGHT THIS LATEST RELEASE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF IT IS SIMILAR TO THE AUSTRALIAN RELEASE!! CAN THE CUSTOMER IN AUSTRAILIA TELL ME IF THEIR DVD IS COMPATIBLE IN OUR DVD PLAYERS?THANKS FOR ANY INFO ANYONE CAN GIVE ME!I AM SORRY THE 2-STAR REVIEWER DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE, AS I CAN SAY I LOVED IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT AND HAVE TO HAVE REGULAR PRISCILLA FIXES!"
3,Comical,"The movie is comical- and I suppose that is that. I felt hidden meaning, besides comedy. There is the idea presented that we must not be ashamed of who we are and who we profess to be be, rather we should be proud. Other than that- the movie takes place in Australia- as a few drag queens get together for a long ride through the outback to destination ""no where"" in a big buss. Troubles occurs at almost every turn- but they queens of the desert handle it in a comical reflection of the ""fem"" perspective of homosexuality. I would recommend renting the movie, if available."
4,Well Done and fun,"This film was well made and a lot of fun to watch. The story covers none typical gay rolls as well as the old and not so wonderful ones. Powerful and dramatic at times as well as belly roll funny. Good film, good acting and fun for the whole FAMILY."
5,Most Favorite Movie,"I panicked when I couldn't find my original tape. The replacement arrived extremely quickly. My most favored movie is on the top of the stack of ones-I-can't-live-without-even-though-they-are-VHS. This is a totally irreverent, trippy and hilarious movie. The costuming is incredible."
5,Step into your zone,"The music is fab, the outfits are over the top and story line is wonderful. I wish I was there with them. Looks like they had a wonderful adventure"
5,A wonderful vibrant movie with a great soundtrack.,"This is a great movie; I just can't say enough about it. From the costumes and choreography to the lessons the three men learn during the course of their journey, it's a masterpiece. Terrence Stamp (who may be remembered as General Zod in Superman II) is phenomonal as a bitter old queen who watched someone he loves die and would like someone new to spend his life with. Guy Pierce (who has gone on to make The Time Machine and the kid's movie Two Brothers) plays the young upstart who likes to stir up trouble without thinking before acting. Hugo Weaving is better known for his roles in The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. He plays his character with great humor and sensitivity in Priscilla. You may have to replay some parts to pick up the dialogue because the Australian accent is thick and they speak fast, but it's well worth it."
4,TERENCE STAMP! YOU DESERVED AN OSCAR!!!,"Terence, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce had to have had a ball making this movie and I'd have given anything to have been a part of the crew!In lieu of that experience, I will cherish my copy of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (and give thanks for the Bill of Rights that says I can have it despite what the religious right says!!)"
1,"Stay Outta' the Sun, Girls....","Well, I watched it. I hated it. It was campy, silly, no plot, WAY over the top, Terence Stamp as Bernadette was the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this ridiculous movie. Gimme a break. Drag Queens that look like barroom entertainment downtown, the gaudy costumes, awful makeup...blech.Now, it's counterpart from the USA, ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"" was a class act.The movie had a STORYLINE, and a plot, and subplots, and a climax.Priscilla lacked all of these things.A bunch of gaudy, ugly, UGLY drag queens in the middle of the outback, performing for the natives??? Oh, gimme a break. Don't waste your money on this."
5,"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert!","Excellent comedy of one transgendered friend tagging along with two rather peculiar Female Impersonators on a quest to the center of Australia for not only a show stopping performance, but a journey for the heart. The costumes are amazing and it's not any wonder why this production won the Academys Honor for costume design for that year.Look close, you'll remember some of these stars in later or earlier roles that have taken you to other worlds and places in time!Be sure to watch the ENTIRE movie as you will see a surprise after all the credits are finished rolling!"
4,The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert,This is a fun movie with great scenery of Australia. The costumes are wonderful and if you have ever been in the outback you have to be amazed that this old bus could carry so much costuming. You can appreciate how difficult it is to drive the old goldie up to Cobber Pedy and onto the Alice.Just a great and fun movie.The boys having a good time and also touching to see the son didn't hold it against his Dad but accepted him and his Mum for thier life style and preferences and loved them both.Maybe it's time we all opened our hearts up a little.
4,Queen of Queens,"This is only the second time I have viewed this movie and although some of the dialogue is cliche, it is a good and funny movie. It deals with a gay man who was formerly married and has a son in a very sympathetic light."
4,I want to go to Australia,"Really charming, lovable movie. Makes its points on acceptance, etc. completely effortlessly (except for that really corny close-up of a portrait of Queen Elizabeth, but never mind) while delivering great entertainment that is genuinely heart-warming without being the least bit syrupy. As great as the costumes, cinematography, and ""classic"" music are, it's the characters who really make it work. The three male leads are all so perfect I can't even choose a favourite. Suffice to say, they're all incredibly funny, and all show their dramatic skills too, which are considerable. All hail Terrence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce! Also lovable are Bill, and Mitzi's fabulous wife--she's just perfect. As it was ending, I wanted it to go on for another 20 or so minutes, just so I wouldn't have to leave all the characters yet."
5,Australian Drag Queens- can it get any better??!,"The reason I initially rented this movie is because Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) is in this, and I have an enormous crush on that man. But the appeal of 'Priscilla' goes way beyond that. The movie is full of rugged individualists who could teach the American politically correct masses a thing or two! It's flashy, funny, thought-provoking, and immeasurably sweet. Check it out!"
4,Outbackragious!,"Priscilla is witty and outragious while maintaining a provacative story line. The three main characters give wonderful performances, and true to their abilities, have all gone on to star in other blockbuster roles. The film holds many parallels to the American film; ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"". Many friends of mine liked Wong Foo better, but it's the glitz they liked. The story in Priscilla was much more gritty and compelling, and the soundtrack was certainly nostalgic! Downfalls of the film were the relatively poor quality of the picture at times and the sound quality itself. I still love it, have purchased the video, and will most likely purchase the DVD. Don't miss this fun, campy film!"
5,A Timeless Classic in Lavender,"The film offers a truly timeless look at the life of transvestites, transsexuals, gays, and straights; their families, friends, lovers, and haters. Hilarious, campy, bittersweet, biting, and witty - an artistic masterpiece for the ages. Regarding the 'Extra Frills:' For once, the ubiquitous ""Director's Comments"" are relevant, informative, and entertaining rather than self-centered. The backgrounds of all the lead actors are explored, an invaluable asset in such a ground-breaking film. Best-of-the-best bonus: an extended look at the Academy Award-winning costumes.... all done on a budget of approximately $5,000. And - nowhere else will you learn the secrets behind Terence Stamp's tongue, and the nickname ""Trumpet."""
4,Priscilla Reigns!,"This has it all-great acting,awesome scenery [the Australian Outback, etc], and mindblowing costumes and song and dance numbers.An absolutely perfect way to escape,when life just gets too doggone dreary and humdrum. Great tounge in cheek, just plain old FUN.Get it-you won't be sorry. It's become one of my favorite 'funky mood, it's been raining forever, I need to escape' movies.Terrance Stamp is amazing-well, they all are, but the biggest scene stealer is the Australian Outback. Pick it up, pop it in the DVD player, and just lose yourself for a bit.If it hadn't been in widescreen, I'd have given it 5 stars-but that's just me-I like my movies taking up the entire 40"" of my screen."
5,This movie is genious!,"I bought this movie for a friend of mine. He was so excited when i gave it to him! The movie was made on a small income, but it is amazing! Its funny, charming, and its always great to see men in drag. A definate must!"
4,Good Entertainment,"I put the movies I like into two rather broad general categories. There are great movies, which has a small membership. Then there are good movies, which is where I put all the movies that I like which aren't ""great"". ""Priscilla"" falls into the ""good"" category, but is definately pretty high in that list. It's very entertaining with some drama and good laughs along the way and a great 70s Disco sound track. Plus it has some great images of Australia and ""feel-good"" ending. Enjoy."
5,Warning! Not for inmature persons.,"This is one of the best films that portraits, the life and sad situations of persons with this way of life. They have to survive in a lot of ways of discrimination, aggressions,fobias, and family pressures. Nevertheless, they enjoy life, make us laught of their customs, and shows. It is an opportunity to laught, and cry."
5,Always loved this movie,"I went to see this movie many times when it was at the theater, and I couldn't wait for it to release on DVD. I lost that copy in a move and went out and bought it again. It's hard to believe this movie was made on a shoe-string budget, and that they could get such an accomplished actor as Terence Stamp. Hugo Weaving, also a favorite of mine from the Matrix and Rings movies is hilarious. Guy Pierce is so believable in his role. The three combine for a hilarious and sometimes emotional rollercoaster ride through the australian outback. I recommend this for anyone's collection."
5,The Adventures of Priscilla Queen if the Desert,Everything was handled perfectly. I was sent a notice that my order was received. I received a notice when it was sent. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Bravo !!
3,not as good as volume 1,"Deep Soul Treasures Volume 1 blew me away. This one is not quite as good, although there are some nice tracks on it."
5,What the doctor ordered,"This is my second order, so it must work the way it is supposed to. My cardiologist wanted the ""bad stuff"" lowered and the ""good stuff"" increased. That's what the niacin did for me. Cholesterols all much better than they have been....with no flushing."
4,Staying Power works...,"Staying Power is written for senior level executives yet has nuggets for managers at all levels. Book was a smooth and easy read. It is broken down into 3 sections: 1) Career Pathing, 2) Personality and 3) Management Style. Lot's of excellent examples and career ""rules."" Thumbs up."
4,Not Your Average Bond,Dalton is the Bond of the books! He went outside the norm of the James Bond tradition and I congradulate him for it. The movie itself is well done. It feels like you watching an actual story then a bunch of action scenes. The keychain scenes are hilarious!
4,Dalton's first Bond film is one of the best!,"After the awful A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights is a welcome return to the sure-fire formula of action, stunts, cool cars and witty humour.Timothy Dalton is great as Bond, and adds a nice touch to the film with dry wit and charm. And the action is great, with car chases reminiscent of Moore's early films.There are problems with the film though. There is the lack of a sufficiently meaty villain, but it's made up for with a nice ensemble of other bad guys including John Rhys-Davies. The plot is somewhat over-complicated, but provides some great action and stunts. A solid entry to the franchise, and a great action film to boot."
5,TIMOTHY DALTON IS AN EXCELLENT REPLACEMENT FOR MOORE,"BY NOW YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY SEEN 20 DIFFERENT REVIEWS... I JUST WANNA SAY THAT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF ESPIONAGE ACTION ADVENTURE MOVIES, PARTICUARLY JAMES BOND, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. ONLY THING IS, THIS IS THE ONLY GOOD ONE BY DALTON."
5,Best Bond Movie of the 80s,Timothy Dalton is James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. Dalton picks up the character of James Bond left behind at the conclusion of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Dalton returns in part to Ian Fleming's James Bond. He is a man of determination who will stop at nothing to get the job done. Dalton is a very good actor who tried to bring great dramatic as well as cinematic elements together to return the status of James Bond as the focal point of the story. Outstanding John Barry score mixing both traditional and 80's sounds to this great movie really contributed to the 007 genre.
4,Dalton was a welcome change to the James Bond Role!,"Dalton brought a level of seriousness and toughness to the role that had been missing since Sean Connery. The plot in The Living Daylights is pretty good, too. It still has a tendency to suffer a little from some of the hokiness that marred the Roger Moore movies, but is by far a superior movie than almost all of Moore's offerings."
1,WHY???????????????,"Cannot understand why all 20 of the first films are not on Blu-Ray, what was WB's reason for only having 11 of the titles?How stupid"
1,Not a good OO7 film,"this is a poorly done OO7 film and here's why: The acting is done without much spirit and humor except for Krabbe's Kuscov, the song is very annoying and you could fall asleep listening to it, the film is extremely boring and the dialogue is weak and theis film is way too overlong"
4,Good film but not one of my favorites,"Dalton did a great job in his short time as Bond. They didn't give him a lot to work with in this one, but he still did a good job."
5,THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEENTHINGS GOOD ABOUT THIS MOVIETHE STORY 5THE ACTING 5AND ALL THE OVER STUFF 5THINGS BAD ABOUT THIS MOVIENOTHINGTHIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE TAKE MY ADVICE BUY THIS MOVIE
5,Deserve's to be one of the best James Bond movies,"This has to be one of the best James Bond movies, up there with Goldfinger, and Man With The Golden Gun. It is also the last for which John Barry wrote the sound track. It is also the only James Bond movie which has two main songs, the title song ""The Living Daylights"", and the song ending the movie ""If There Was A Man"". For those of you who don't know, the scene at the end of the movie with Kara playing in the symphony, has John Barry as the conductor. Timothy Dalton plays a great James Bond, with a tough and gritty character similar to Sean Connery in the early Bond movies. Maryam D'Abo plays a great Bond girl, although she doesn't get her bedroom scene with Bond. Her character is presented as a contradiction of both innocence and toughness. Beautiful scenery of Vienna, Morroco, and Italy can be seen throughout the movie and fits well with the plot."
5,"""ONE OF THE BEST BOND FILMS EVER!""",If you like action and excitement then this is the movie for you. Plenty of explosions with good sound effects. Timothy Dalton does a really good job of playing the role of James Bond because of his slick attitude. You have to see this movie!
4,surprisingly good,"I liked this video much more than I thought I would. As someone who thinks 007 can only be Connery or Brosnan, I resisted Dalton and Moore until I had no choice. I'm still not crazy about Moore, but Dalton does a good job with the role even if he is somewhat more pedestrian than either Connery or Brosnan.Plus, I liked the story. It helped that they brought back the Aston Martin (complete with squeaky brakes). Even though Connery mentions a Bentley in Goldfinger, the Aston Martin is the original 007 ride. For reasons that are known only to the producers, they put Moore into an American Motors standard issue in TMWTGG (Did they think that because it had the same initials as Aston Martin, it was the same pedigree?), or a Lotus in FYEO.It also helped that Dalton's relationship with Maryam d'Abo actually developed over the course of the film making it more genuine.He may not be Connery or Brosnan, but you could do a lot worse (several times over) than this title."
3,Weaker effort,"The Living Daylights has a few things going for it and they are good acting, a good plot, suspense, and great stuntwork. The bad things are an annoying song, d'Abo's dull Kara, a weak script, about no action, the plot needs a genius to untangle, and this film is VERY boring and goes on WAY too long."
2,Not one of Bonds best.,"Not a big fan of this movie. Timothy Dalton made two Bond movies, definitely the worse in my opinion. Not a knock at Dalton, just not a fan of the movie irregardless who played Bond."
2,A bad start for Dalton,"""The Living Daylights"" is a disappointment for several reasons. The biggest reason is the surprisingly unengaging plot. The second reason is that Timothy Dalton doesn't seem comfortable playing James Bond. He's not a bad actor but instead of making his own interpretation of the character (like he did in the next movie, ""Licence To Kill"") he seems to be imitating Roger Moore. The reason is most likely that the script was written with Moore in mind. Lois Maxwell was replaced by Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny and she didn't seem right for the part at all.""The Living Daylights"" was not a good start for Dalton. Luckily the series did improve."
4,Good debut for Timothy Dalton,"The Living Daylights is the first Bond movie(out of only two)with Timothy Dalton.He looks a little uneasy at times,but for the most part,did very well,and plays the part a lot more seriously than Roger Moore did.As for the movie itself,it's very good,and a lot better than Moore's last 007 film,A View to a Kill.There is plenty of action and gadgets,including a really cool Aston Martin car.Maryam d'Abo is good as very pretty Bond girl Kara Milovny.Joe Don Baker as Brad Whitaker and Jeroen Krabbe' as General Koskov are the main villains,they both do a pretty good job,but aren't that memorable as far as Bond villains go.The John Barry musical score(the last one he's done in the Bond series to date) and title song by Ah-Ha are both very good.Overall,it's a good Bond film,and nice debut for Dalton,who really came into his own as Bond in the next film,License to Kill,which is excellent.Great DVD with a sharp picture,good sound,and lots of extras."
4,Revitalized 007,"After 12 years of Roger Moore mediocrity, the 007 series recaptured the Ian Fleming spirit with this 1987 spy thriller. ""The Living Daylights"" marked Timothy Dalton's impressive debut as a deadly serious James Bond - an ideal choice for a no-nonsense, globe-hopping adventure. Good scripting by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson brings out the best in John Glen's action-filled direction. Once again, the villains are disappointingly lackluster, yet the production values remain top-notch. John Barry contributes another memorable score (his last 007 outing to date). Though ""Licence to Kill"" (1989) proved a worthy follow-up, ""The Living Daylights"" is the superior Dalton effort."
4,One of the best in the series,"Along with From Russia With Love and For Your Eyes Only, the Living Daylights is one of the best non-comic book Bond films. Aimed at adults, the twisting plot consists of Bond helping a Russian General defect, and then learning that this Russian General is working with an arms dealer to supply guns to Afghanistan. Dalton is fine as Bond, but still can't match the "" personality "" both Connery and Moore gave to Bond. The great action sequences and good performance by Maryam d'Abo make this a winner. A great title song by A-HA only adds to the whole package. After a travesty like A View To A Kill, this film helped remind me why I love Bond."
4,Third Best Bond,"Dalton is the third best Bond IMO (Connery & Craig coming first). This one movie is better than the entire Roger Moore run. It's much closer to the books & Ian Fleming's original vision. The downside - it is slow moving & unnecessarily sprawling. The movie runs 2 hours 11 minutes - it could have been a tight 1 hour 45 minutes, IMO.Small quibble. Good script, great cast, excellent score, fun action. With a more mature tone than the Moore series. Recommended, especially if you loved Casino Royale."
4,The Afghan resistance as frame!,"The strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon ` mercenary and a Russian General, both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades. Bond will have to face them until unmasking.This saga is loaded with admirable sequences, fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script. The first incursion of Timothy Dalton was very gratifying, because at last Bond returns to his origins, far from being a simple Cartoon character since Moore was hired.Recommended without reserves."
3,"Not crazy about Dalton, but he action in the movie make a difference","Where can I start? What is it with them picking out a person to play bond where they are in their 40s or almost 50s? Can't they ever get someone who is at least in their late 20s or mid 30s? At least Connery was 32 years old when he stared in Dr. No! Anyway, Dalton was a little to series and seem like he was not having fun with the role and he only sleeps with one bond girl and doesn't get any till the end of the movie? ALso, Marayam D'abo did not have any type of sex appeal! It looks like she was bored with the role! What just happened? I really think that Ian Fleming would have turned over in his grave if he seen this film! The action was ok, locations excellent, but just lacked the Ian Fleming genre!"
3,I'm back-with the same thoughts,"It is a crime, in my opinion, for them to let Dalton do two Bond movies. See my review on ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" I feel the same way"
2,BORED THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME.,"This movie has two good things going for it, the begining and the end. Its the slow pace of this movie that just puts me to sleep. The opening scene, climax, and final fight between bond and the villan are very good, but every thing else in between is slow paced and boring. The title song was also a poor choice. This film was John Glen's a only poorly directed film, all his others are much better."
2,Great CD but didn't want wide screen,"The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen."
2,Insipid and Stupid Just Like All Bond Films Are.,"Viewed: 12/11Rate: 312/11: Seeing The Living Daylights, I had to decide who gave the worst performance: Timothy Dalton, Maryam d'Abo, Jeroen Krabbe, or Joe Don Baker. They were all truly bad, and I've settled on Krabbe. The man cannot act at all. On the other hand, Dalton was a good looking guy back then, but we need to admit that he was terrible playing James Bond. He just came flat in everything he did, no matter what, even in his lines. I thought the story was all right and the film somewhat passable as well. As always, the best part of The Living Daylights was the opening credits. They sure knew how to make it stylish and cool to watch. All in all, The Living Daylights is a small improvement over Roger Moore's dreck, but they are all ridiculously bad just the same. By the way, Smiert Shpionam means ""Death to Spies."""
3,"The clear image,but...","The image of this Blu-ray disc is very clear,but I'm sorry that it has often freeze and return to start."
5,Stays in your head before you fall asleep at night,"It's what REM might sound like if they'd come from England, but that description doesn't really do them justice. The most beautiful, desperate, hopeful album you've ever heard."
5,Say Something.,"I remember briefly seeing the video for 1993's ""Say Something"" on MTV. It struck a nerve and I have become a devout James fan. Having all their cds, I believe Laid to be their best. It is more haunting, original and consistent than any of their other cds, save Whiplash in 1997. Brian Eno produced Laid and did it very well. Great songs like ""Out To Get You"", ""Sometimes"", ""Dream Thrum"", ""One Of The Three"", ""Say Something"", ""P.S."", ""Knuckle Too Far"" and ""Laid"" make this cd shimmer. A mostly quiet cd, Laid has the lyrical pain and haunting music to become a classic. This is a must have for any rock collector."
3,"Awesome title track, pretty good album","I'm just a casual fan of this band, and I bought ""Laid"" for the title track. Probably like a lot of ""James"" newbies, the first time I heard the song ""Laid"" was in a commercial for ""American Wedding."" (Great tune, but am I the only one who thinks it sounds like a Neil Diamond song?) If you're like me, and really like ""That 'She-Only-Comes-When-She's-On-Top'"" song, but you're wary of buying the whole album, relax -- it's all good. None of the other tracks are as catchy and fun as the title track, but they're all interesting and enjoyable in their own way. So, if you dig ""Laid: the song,"" you'll most likely dig ""Laid: the album,"" too. Three stars because I feel like too many of the songs sound the same, and, despite giving the entire album several chances, I still feel like skipping ahead to the title track most of the time. PS) I've never met a women who didn't get a smile on her face when she heard/thought about the lyrics to ""Laid."""
5,Steller album,I was familiar with the hit song from the album but never purchased it until now... WOW! Great album from beginning to end.
5,What I need....,"Laid: Truly one of the greatest albums of all time. I am happy to have had this album as a part of my life for the last 15 years. Out To Get You, Sometimes, Say Something, Lullaby, One Of The Three - just incredible. So glad they're creating new music again. If you've never experienced the music created by James, this is a great place to start."
3,"An interesting, challenging film","Basic Instinct is one of my favorite films. Until recently, though, I had never seen Basic Instinct 2. I decided to give it a shot, not knowing what to expect. I do not usually like sequels, but Basic Instinct 2 is the exception. I do admit that I had to watch it more than once to get to know and understand it better. I have watched it five times; the fifth time I viewed it with the director's commentary activated--Michael Caton-Jones provides a good, informative commentary. Sharon Stone and David Morrissey turn out solid performances in their roles as Catherine Tramell and Dr. Michael Glass. As for the storyline, it is intriguing, and I also like the fact that the film takes place in London, England. The cinematography is nicely done, in addition. I am glad that I made the decision to view Basic Instinct 2 because it is a worthy follow-up to Basic Instinct."
2,Okay but nothing like original,I like the original Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas acted good together. The new story is exciting or interesting like the original.
5,Excellent Story/Psychological Intrigue,"I felt this was an excellent sequel to Basic Instinct. The storyline with plot twists and turns were all there with the characteristic Catherine Trammel psychological cat and mouse games. After reading reviews that stomped and praised, I didn't know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie after watching it on pay per view."
3,"Close, But No Cigar","Basic Instinct 2 would have been a better stand alone movie than it was a sequel. That said, I enjoyed Sharon Stone's reprisal of the role. I wish that her leading man had been more dynamic. He seemed to be a wet towel next to het. Helpless and impotent. Easily manipulated, Dr. Glass (Portrayed By Morrisey) makes one bad decision after another and ends up destroying himself. I have to wonder how Pierce Brosnan would have handled the role or Clive Owen. The DVD extra said that four other actors auditioned for the role and I'm certain that one of them would have been either Brosnan or Owens. I wonder why one or the other was rejected by Stone.My one major problem with the movie is you never know who commits the killings. Is it Catherine or is it Dr. Glass or the detective? We never find out and that drove me up a wall. Director Michael Caton-Jones admits that that was his intention, but I disagreed with the rationale.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
3,Ok not great,This movie is ok not for kids but I knew that. Follows the line of the first Basic Instinct movie nice ending.
2,Disappointed,"Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie. Basic Instinct 2, not so good. But Sharon Stone is still HOT! It is worth buying the movie just to see her."
2,"Basic Instinct 2, Basically BAD","This movie was not a complete disaster. It did keep the character of Sharon Stone very similar to the first one, a good show of a Borderline/Antisocial mix of personality disorder (cluster B in general). However, the repetative sexual inuendoe's, the overall lack of suspense at times that should have been, and the in general poor script made this almost painful to watch. The script kept re-hashing itself every 20 minutes with sharon's lines. The whole risk addiction was poor. Also, this painted a really poor image of psyciatrists, which I'm not a fan of. This could have been a bigger mess, but the directors and producers did not do what other sequals have done, increase blood and increase nudity. They kept it at par, if not toned it down just a bit. If you are going to see this, borrow it, or rent it with a coupon. It will definatly waste two hours of your life."
1,Neither Uncut NOR extended! Total Deception!,"I can't beleive I'm the first to mention this! There are a few ""good"" (wink-wink) scenes which have been removed from this DVD version! A lesbian scene and part of Stone's hot tub scene are gone. It' seems clear that the makers of this film are depserately trying to lose as much money as possible. Although perhaps this DVD is selling well for them since they've went to the extent of flat out lieing to the consumer about it's content. Studio DVD labels make me laugh with their ""Unrated-Uncut"" sellpoint that always amounts to almost nothing interesting.. but this is unusual since the DVD is actually MISSING scenes. Tragic."
3,Basic Instinct 2,Basic Instinct 2 is an ok Psycho/Sexual thriller but not as good as the first one. Sharon Stone is once again good in her role as the ice pick wielding Catherine Tramell. She is still very sexy in this film. The film does drag on a bit towards the end and David Morrissey does a good job as the psychiatrist David Glass.The film does give us more of the same as the first one. The film does lack a bit of the spark of the first one but is nonetheless worth a look.
1,Rubbish!,"This is a very weak re-creation of the original one with many cliché taken form it. In the meanwhile there is much less thrill and misery, only meaningless vulgarity from Soho."
1,A waste of time,"Flimsy plot, cheesy dialogue, characters (or, rather, caricatures) behaving in ways that are not only unlikely but so obviously unlikely that it's farcical. And, oh, yeah, if you're looking for skin, sure, there are a few seconds, here and there, but you can find a lot more with a lot less tare very easily. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Basic Instinct 2,"This is a disappointment compared to the first Basic Instinct. Sharon Stone is relegated to a lesser character that's simply the focal point of the story that leads to Morrisey's downfall. What makes this film such a weak effort is that it tries to imitate the original with its ambiguity without the originality. In fact, I felt that the Sharon Stone character (Catherine Tramell) was nothing more than a caricature. It's the writing that hurt this movie. Once again we're left without a conclusion but it doesn't have near the believability of the original movie, everything seems forced & without real depth.Take your own chance with this movie, it's not as intriguing or original as the original. Even Sharon Stone is pretty lame. The DVD does have bonus features that includes deleted scenes & an alternate ending, but nothing very revelatory."
2,Very Disappointing,After such a long gap since the first film it makes you wander why they bothered with this.Weak storyline set in the UK.Unless your are a Sharon Stone fan give it a miss !
1,Terrible sequel makes me want to ice pick myself,"Sharon Stone (The Specialist, The Mighty) reprises her role as Catherine Tramell the manipulative ice picking woman who got away in the first Basic Instinct movie way back in 1992. Now she returns and she's stirring up the pot again. A very awful David Morrissey (Derailed, Stoned) stars as Dr. Michael Glass who takes sessions with Catherine. Things take a turn as bodies start to come up and Glass has his eye on her. David Thewlis (Harry Potter 3, Dragonheart) who shouldnt of been in this plays Det. Washburn, a cop who knows Catherine and tries to warn Glass about her before it's too late. Stone looks good but she delivers nothing, in this dreadfully sludge of a sequel. I'm just praying they dont make a 3rd one. 14 years too late if you ask me. Also starring Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead), Flora Montgomery (Wuthering Heights, Heat of the Sun) and Hugh Dancy (King Arthur, Ella Enchanted)"
3,the Trailer and Cover are enough,"Sharon still looks great, but the film is not worth the purchase. Enjoy the classic original, but pass on this one!"
1,A really prdeictable loser of a movie,"Sharon Stone, as the psychotic Catherine Trammel, isn't even sexy. She looks and acts like a 900 sex-talk liar. The party with all the weirdo freak writers in which some of them didn't even recognize Sharon Stone's character, right after she's been on the news, was really stupid. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass (David Morissey) was one sex-addicted, wimpy, weak-willed wanker (how's that for alliteration). Anyway, this is definitely one of those movies in which you've got to be pretty dumb not to figure out what's going to happen next. What a predictable flop."
1,Worse movie of the year!!!,"One day, I was watching the original Basic Instinct because that movie is a classic and then after I thought I would rent this one...Although it was not boring but not any good either...The only good thing about this movies was seeing Sharon Stone the way all of us guys like to see her...Other than that, it's not worth seeing..."
1,The worst movie ever,"I went to see this on opening night (March 30th) as this was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me. I was only able to stay in the theater for 56 minutes(out of 1h54min). I still cannot believe how bad this movie was(the acting is worthy of daytime soaps at best). If you're thinking of watching it, do yourself a favor and rent the first one instead. Gotta score high in next year's razzies, unless Jenny McCarthy makes a movie before the end of the year."
1,Deserves the razzy award,"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This movie is absolutely horrible and deserving of this year's razzy award. Sharon Stone just took the money and ran. Trust me. The use of the title ""Basic Instinct"" on this loser is a travesty."
1,Basic Extinct,"As far as Belated Sequels go, ""Basic Instinct 2"" (2006) is an ice-picking disaster. The location shift from San Francisco to Swinging London sounds intriguing, but Sharon Stone's take-no-prisoners femme fatale has evolved into a self-parody. Coherence and logic take a back seat to the decadent stylistics. Judging by the poor box-office response, don't hold your breath for ""Basic Instinct 3."""
1,"Boring, Unnecessary Sequel","If you ask me, I think Sharon Stone is one of the most overrated actresses ever. Not only that, but she seems to be the most self-centered, conceited actress as well. This movie made my point. Basic Instinct 1 was alright, nothing grand or spectacular. Basic Instict 2 was just horrible and unnecessary. Why, oh why, did this film had to be made to begin with? Other than being a movie to showcase Sharon Stone's self-centered attitude and persona as she relies more on posing for the camera and flaunting her overdone sex appeal dealie, what was the point? Absolutely nothing. I was turned off by the film even before it was released, as i was watching interviews of Sharon Stone talking about the film (well, pretty much, just talking about herself). I wish self-centered actresses didn't get so much praise and attention just because they have a pretty face and had done one risque sexual scene that was done years ago."
1,Sharon Stone is too old to be in this role,"I watched 10 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. Sharon Stone is just too old to be beliveable in this role. She still looks good for her age, thanks to the plastic surgery, but she's 50 years old! I was embarrased for her."
1,Garbage as expected,Sharon looked terrible: she is covered in makeup to hide her age...her legs are like sticks...her blotched skin so evident that the makeup cant hide it all.This woman cant act to save her life. Just a skinny amaciated looking woman who is hyped up to be 'sexy' by the media who have nothing better to do that brown nose a hollywood 'star'.Trust me this movie sucked and Sharon Stone
2,Basic Instinct 2 - not basic enough,"Movie moves along too slow. Plot is weak. Without a view of a young or older Sharon Stone's vagina in 1080P , this movie offers little"
1,what an utterly trashy movie,Don't waste your money on this trash. I bought the DVD and what a waste of money this movie is. All it is Sharon Stone trying to prove that she was as good looking as she was years ago and to see see how much sex can be put on the screen.
1,movie stinks,this movie was full of smut and didn't interest me no plot just a bunch of stupid sex shes terrible in this movie
2,Overall a bad movie!,"Basic Instinct 2 is really one of those films that you regret wasting 2 hours on viewing it. The film was for some unknown reason shot in London instead of USA and maybe that's the reason why this film lacks the excitement of the first film. Sharon Stone looks just great, like she hasn't grown older a month. Her fans should see this film but otherwise avoid wasting time or money on this one. And I very rarely say for any movie that it's bad."
1,thumps way down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a disappointment!!! I am a big fan of Basic Instinct and Sharon Stone. I was trilled when I heard they were making BI2. When I heard it was taking place in London I said, BIG MISTAKE!! Catherine T. will not be living in England. She will live, other than the US, in Spain, Italy, or France; where the beautiful and scandalous people gathered. Then, when I heard who the main male actos was I said, OK SECOND BIG MISTAKE!!! I mean, need I say more!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Basic Instinct,A poor combination of Body Heat (70's) and the original with Michael Douglas. The only good acting and character was the police detective. Not worth the time.
3,This film wasn't as bad as everyone thinks.,"Though I'm giving Basic Instinct 2 three stars, I think it deserves 3 1/2. While not as good as the first Basic Instinct film, I found that I really enjoyed watching this. I've already seen it five times; and, strange as it may seem, the film actually gets better with each viewing. What makes the film for me is Sharon Stone. Even at her age, she till plays the perfect ""wicked lady"" to every man's sexual fantasies. The viewer can tell that Ms. Stone had fun making this film. No one could've played the main character better than her. I know that I've certainly had fun watching her. It's almost like a moth being drawn to a burning flame. It can't help itself. That's the affect that Sharon Stone has on me. I'm drawn to the burning flame of her character's killing passion, and I can't help myself, just like the men (and women) in the film."
5,Harley Lamp,A very nice product. Lights and sounds work exactly as discribed. A must for any Harley owner or fan.
5,Loved the Harley Lamp,"We bought this lamp for our son, and it is great. The sound is good and he loves the headlights and taillights that turn on."
1,Lamp is not what was advertised!,"The lamp was described as one that would make the ""varoom"" sound.The lamp which we received makes no sound. I consider that false advertising, and will not waste my time trying to get the advertised lamp from such a dishonestprovider.Kng Harley Varoom Lamp"
5,beautiful coat,"Warm, beautiful coat. Fits very nicely. I bought it for my son after he was ordained so he had a nice black coat to wear to funerals. This was a bargain for the price--I thought about getting one for myself!"
2,"Really awful customer service, coat is just OK","This coat is sized too large in the shoulders and huge in the waist. (And I'm not thin.) I needed to go down a size from my actual size, and yes that's with a suitcoat on underneath. So if you say yes when you're asked, ""Can I super size that for you?"", order your regular size. Anyone with a BMI under 25 should go down a size.Since it didn't fit, I re-ordered the item. It's been 11 days and the item hasn't shipped, and after two emails to customer service they pretty much said it will ship when it ships. They don't take customer service calls on the weekend. (The year 1965 called, they want their customer service department back.)At the real prices for Jos A Banks (70% discount from ""list""), this is a reasonable value for my needs - for an everyday coat for the subway, to save wear on my real topcoat. The design and construction is OK. The wool is fairly thin. It's just good enough not to return. If I ever actually get it in my size, that is."
1,Another Book Not by an Author,Why isn't there an author attached to this book? Just editors from this quick buck series. Do they have experience starting a import/export business? You can probably find everything in this book from google. Save your money.
2,Light reading to start you off... not much more..,"This is the first book I read when I decided to start my own import/export business. It's light, easy reading and mildly humorous, making it a quick read and is good for basic definitions if you don't know anything about import/export. The first 60 odd pages have a straightforward basic description of the import/export process, after which the book goes into marketing, how to do business in foreign countries, what equipment you need..etc.. and all the other stuff you should actually know already as part of your life skills. Having lived in a number of other countries and learned some foreign languages, and having a good grasp of IT and telecommunications, I found the last 2/3rd's of the book pretty useless, but it may be helpful if you've been living under a rock your whole life. For those who want the real 'meat and potatoes' from the get go, I recommend the Dummies guide and Kenneth Weiss book on Starting an Import.Export Business. Happy trading :)"
1,Look for something else,"I did not find this book very interesting. It is not written for a book audience but it seems its a xerox copy for master's degree thesis committee. The book is not well written either and it is very boring. If you want some practical applications I'd suggest getting one of the following books:Practical Guide to Environmental Management (9th ed)by Frank B. FriedmanDown to Earth: Applying Business Principles to Environmental Managementby Forest L. ReinhardtAn Introduction to Corporate Environmental Managementby Stefan Schaltegger, et al (Paperback )Handbook for Implementing an ISO 14001 Environmental Management System: A Practical Approachby John Kinsella, Annette D. McCully, Annette Dennis McCully"
4,Rally Round,I love Steel Pulse. I had most of these hits on LP's and wanted to update my collection. Steel Pulse is timeless - they along with other original Reggae artist put Jamaica on the map.
4,Steel Pulse Rules,"A little 80's-ish in terms of over-use of synthesizery keyboards and such, but contains some of the greatest reggae anthems ever written. A MUST OWN for any serious reggae fan...unless of course you have one of their many other compilations containing those same anthems."
2,Not the best of STEEL PULSE,"Any compilation that doesn't include SOUND SYSTEM, MACKA SPLAFF or HANDSWORTH REVOLUTION is suspect. The best place to start is REGGAE GREATS, as it contains the early-mid 70's songs, and those are truly classics! If you like your reggae watered down like pop music, buy this!"
5,Steel Pulse Smash Hits,"I was looking for Steppin Out because I loved it in college but I never knew the artist or the name of the song. To my surprise there were several other hits that I enjoyed in college such as Radio. I also adore the song paying tribute to the Black National Flag - The Red, Gold, Black, & Green."
4,Great jazz from a great jazz musician,It is a wonderful tribute album from one of the all time jazz greats. Timelees.
4,Great computer!,"This is a great computer. The computer is very nicely designed with nice glossy screen. Finger print login is a nice security feature and the built in camera works pretty good. Neat little remote that fits inside the computer to control your movie viewing. But the buttons are so small they are hard to push so the movie doesn't always react the way you want it. There is alot of HP and third party pre-loaded software which is a pain since most if it you don't need. I would suggest reinstall Vista if you can. Computer came pre-loaded with trial version of Office 2007. But you need a Product Key to use it. The product key was not included with the computer so I could not use the trial version anyway! Vista is nice but many software is incompatible. Otherwise, I am very happy with the laptop. Plus the price was great with the rebate from HP and Amazon!"
4,Nice machine,"HP Pavilion DV6565US 15.4"" Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5250, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, Vista Premium)Love this machine. This computer has many powerful features. The only complaint I have is Vista. I work with it at a high school and all the other machines have XP. Vista would NOT allow downgrading to XP. I am getting used to Vista so not so bad afterall."
5,Son's college computer,"Our second laptop, and this rocks over last year's Toshiba. Lots of great laptops out there, but I needed one that would work for my son at college today. HP is really starting to put it all together. I know they were once just a great printer company. I currently have 5 HP printers and would use nothing else, and to branch out into the laptops was a great decision. My son loves it. Great price. Fast machine."
1,Computer is a Failure with Vista,"I want to like this computer. I have an older HP Pavilion and I love it. However, the new versions of HP computers with Vista are horrible. In the week that I've had the computer:1. QuickPlay does not work. You have to boot into Windows before using QuickPlay. HP knows this, but doesn't change the advertising.2. HP's upgrade software does not work currently with Vista.3. Fingerprint Reader is buggy.4. System Restore CD does not restore the computer. Less than a week and it's ready for a reformat.Boxing up the computer tonight. It's sad when a company stops being good."
3,No tem Bluetooth entegrado.,"Se voc está querendo comprar esse notebook porque ele tem Bluetooth, desista. A Amazon, apesar de já ter recebido inúmeros comentários a esse respeito continua deixando o erro na descrisso desse computador. Se anteriormente eu soubesse disto, no teria comprado esse modelo."
5,Key to Yourself,This book's message is very down to earth and easy to read. The author's belief in what she was writing is obvious on every page. The book is very unpretentious and simple. I consider it the best self-help book I've ever read.
4,"Positive, repetitive, old fashioned good advice","I like this chestnut from the good ol' days of self-help advice. The ""secret"" before infomercials and toll free numbers. Pleasantly repetitive. These days the self-help gurus are flying around having seminars, living in mansions, making guest shots on Oprah. In the 1950s Venus Bloodworth lived quietly in Georgia with a psychiatric practice and occasionally taught lessons to women confined in a nearby state prison. Good one for a night stand in a guest room. Maybe your lost teenager will pick it up."
5,Key to yourself,"Wonderful no-nonsense, easy to read approach to understanding the world around you and allowing the best of everything to come into your life. Highly recommended!"
5,Thank You,"About 25 years ago, I was having a spiritual crisis. I was 22 at the time and just about to go insane. I met a total stranger (Harvey, if you're out there, I can't thank you enough) who just happened to have a copy of ""The Key to Yourself"" with him. He gave it to me and it absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, changed my life. I try to read a few pages of this book every day. It just feels good. Do I have to? No. But it is like taking a shower each day. You don't have to, but you'll feel a whole lot better if you do!"
4,Fantastic,"Awesome book on teachings of Jesus put into simplistic form, very informative however requires effort to put in practice. Loved this read."
5,"VERY INFORMATIVE, BEST MOTIVATIONAL BOOK I'VE EVER READ.","KEY TO YOURSELF HOLDS A SELF EXPLANATORY TITLE. THE BOOK HAS DONE JUST THAT; IT GAVE PRECISE GUIDES LINES TO FOLLOW, IN ORDER TO HAVE TRUE HAPPINESS WITHIN MYSELF. AND NOW I HAVE REAL JOY AND LOVE IN MY LIFE. AND MOST OF ALL KEY TO YOURSELF HAS SHOWN ME HOW TO HAVE A PEACE OF MIND IN THE MIST OF A CRISIS. MY AUNT GAVE TO ME AS A GIFT THIS PAST MOTHERS DAY. SINCE THEN I'VE READ IT OVER 6 TIMES. I JUST WANT TO SAY, ""IF YOU DON'T HAVE ""KEY TO YOURSELF"" IN YOUR POSESSION RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!"""
5,Excellent book,The book is amazing and has some very useful tipe for the GMAT. The number of exercises is enough to give you the practice to crack the GMAT. A must buy.
5,Classic and cool,"I've had a set of four of these bowls for a week. They are well made, and have a classic style. The glaze is thick and shiny, which is a nice contrast to the dull unglazed stoneware rim and underside. The bowl is made to stack securely to optimize cupboard space. It is just the right size for soup and small lunches. It is a pleasure to use this bowl."
4,Definitely More Industrial than Thrash,"The culmination of Jeff Waters' solo experiments is Remains. Recorded and produced entirely by Waters himself, the album is unlike any other Annihilator. The first several songs give off a NIN/Rammstein industrial metal vibe which, though quite well written, are a major departure from his other work. Human Remains, Murder, and the instrumental at the album's end, Bastiage, all reflect this. There are several thrash songs however, such as the ultra heavy Dead Wrong, brutal fast Reaction, and the classic Tricks and Traps. It's not at all a bad album, just noticably different from the others."
3,A bit different,Not as good as some of the other Annihilator stuff. It is a bit more industrial and less thrashy. Perhaps just an experimental solo effort. Not the best but still good listening.
5,a childs dream book,"When I was growing up, my brothers and sisters and I would sit and read this book and look at the awesome pictures. We learned some good things by just looking at the vegetables and fruits. Godd stuff, all of it. Asan adult, this is best used as a gateway to understanding the ""back to basics"" ""grassroots"" movement. It has a list of other books to read at the end of each section that go further in depth. I still like to look at the pictures :)"
5,I'be had this book for probably...about 20 years....,"Not really a review but...if I were shipwrecked on the proverbial desert island...with only ten books, references, etc., this would be near the top of the list. I have referred to it countless times for everything from home-made ice cream recipes to orienteering....often the first place I go for ""arcane"" information. It's kind of like having country old-timers to answer your questions...mostly the basics...but generally that's enough...I havn't seen the new edition...but if it's half the original...it is a must have...gar"
5,Can't live without this book...,The true hard-core reference book for those who are committed to getting 'Back to Basics.' A very traditional guide that provides complete instructions in a very user-friendly format relating to the essentials of living in a self-reliant lifestyle. You'll have piece of mind after buying this book.
5,Neat Book,"This was a really interesting book and I got a whole more than I expected. This book covers all kinds of traditional skills from chopping wood, building houses, plowing fields, food preparation, and so on. Just about anything you can imagine on everyday life skills from days long gone.The bonus part to this was that it included a lot of modern day adaptations and applications for these skills. It could be a useful how-to manual for those that want to live a more simple life. It also includes a description of alternate eco-friendly fuel sources"
5,A Wealth of Practical Information,"My grandparents owned the first edition of this book years ago and I read it almost every time I was over at their house. When I saw it was updated, I bought my own copy. This is a how-to tome par excellence! In these pages you can learn to go far toward practical self sufficiency. Just about anything and everything you could ever seek to know regarding hands-on survival skills is explained inside this book. It's useful information for everyday life and a potential lifesaver in times of crisis. In here you can learn how to start fires under any weather conditions, make your own shoes from scratch, build furniture, houses, boats, find out how to raise animals, grow gardens and survive diasters. I feel more confident in my ability to get by in almost any situation than I did before I re-discovered this pragmatic classic. Knowledge, as they say, is power."
5,The Oracle!,"After singing so many wrong verses and words, it's great to have a nice source to go to to get 'er straight! I really like the annotations, without which I would have never known what a ""Catch Colt"", or hundreds of other obscure sayings really meant. It brought out a new respect for both Hunter and Barlow, and to understand the depth of lots of the lyrics I simply didn't understand. It's part of, ""Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right""If you liked this book, take a look at ""A Box of Rain"", by Bob Hunter. No annotations, just poetry...but stunning stuff just the same.A Box of Rain: Lyrics: 1965-1993"
