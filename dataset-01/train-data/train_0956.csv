5,A Beautiful Film,"I'll just have to be honest, I haven't even seen the film yet, but I've read the novel and the script by James Shaamus and I'm impressed. Ang Lee is a wonderful director and is much worthy of praise for bringing this story to the screen, something that's been needing to happen for a long time. And how wonderful to see Jewel in this film. She is a beautiful and talented woman that has made a wonderful name for herself and it's great to see her take on this role. So see Ride With the Devil...you'll enjoy."
2,"Realistic Civil War violence, but so what?","This is a tale of skirmishes between gangs of young men who see the reason to kill and pillage as justified because the other side ""wants to change our way of life"". If this was meant as an anti-war movie, it succeeded as such for me, but I don't believe that was the director's intention.The cinematography is very well done, the acting is certainly favorable, and the character development is adquate, but the movie drags on endlessly. I'm sure this is an excellent composite of the skirmishes in the ""border states"" at the start of the Civil War, but I'm not sure what the message we can bring away from it is.Realism for the sake of realism doesn't justify the making of this movie. Well drawn ""trees"", unfocused ""forest""."
2,Didn't care for it,"Got to the 11th chapter before giving up on this Confederacy apologist film. Sorry, but don't see slaveholders in a good light. As a Black female, I will always root for the ""Federals"". It took another 100 plus years for freedom for Blacks in the South after the end of the Civil War, so I don't really see the need for movies that show the ""humanity"" of Southerners who fought tooth and nail for breaking up this nation so they could continue slavery.Anyway, this is not a movie for progressive minded folks. I'm sure there are movies such as Glory, which are not on the wrong side of history.Nuff said!"
1,RIDE WITH THE DEVIL,"I ORDERED 'RIDE WITH THE DEVIL' UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CRITERION COLLECTIONWAS AUTOMATICALLY IN BLUE RAY FORMAT. I ACCEPTED DELIVERY ONLY TO FIND OUTTHAT IT WAS NOT. THE ADDED MATERIAL WAS HARDLY WORTH THE ADDED COST, LET ALONEMY HAVING TWO COPIES NOW."
1,real snips will be different than the picture,I order 7 snips I tought it will be the same snip on the picture but when I opend the package it was different model I don't like to use.
2,Smells great but very watered down,"It smells really nice and has a decent amount of little scrubby bits, but honestly it's barely last two weeks and it's kind of upsetting because I usually get a month out of a bottle this size."
3,Np,Definitely not the best I've read. The story line was very weak and this book should not have been full price! The sex scenes were also weak. Three stars only because I finished reading it while amazed how heather graham can write over four hundred pages of absolutely NOTTHING
2,Not worth the time,"I don't usually bother to write reviews of books, but this is one I can't fail to write my opinion of. I am in love with the Viking era, read as many romances set in this time period as I can find, and an a member of a reinactment society. Yet this is the first Viking romance I couldn't bring myself to finish.The history is fine, but even the setting was not enough to keep my attentions. Something just doesn't work about this book. We get both a tortured hero and a near-rape forced seduction all in one. No man who is a man commits rape, and there is simply not enough to this plot to overcome the hero's terrible failings.I was disgusted."
2,One of the worst Viking romances I've ever read,"After reading Heather Grahams ""Lord of the Wolves"", which I enjoyed tremendously, I thought I'd try another one of her many novels. I was rather disappionted to find this book lacked all the wonderful dialogue that ""Lord of the Wolves"" had. After our heroine is captured and wed to the Viking pretty much nothing else goes on but constant pickering. Which of course would be o.k. if I hadn't expected ""romance"" in a romance novel........"
3,Deja vu,"This seems to be the same story as the first book; bad guys come, girl is forced to marry a stranger, stranger turns out to be the bad guy who is actually a good guy, they fall in love but won't tell each other, a baby is born, real bad guy comes to kidnap mom & baby, husband kills bad guy, declarations of love are given, everyone lives happily ever after."
5,outstanding,"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard since the Motown days. I love the way Wanda sings Holding on with Both Hands. It's a shame the Marvelettes were neglected. I would like to get the picture of the Marvelettes from the 12inch single ""When your young and in love."""
2,Two and half men,"i haven't recieved this item yet! when I'm i going to get it? i paid $20.00 for it, I received the fourth edition but not this one"
3,season 3,One cd was not snapped into the case correctly so in transit it scratched the heck out of it . The others in the case correctly were fine
5,OLDIES LOVER,"AGAIN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE ACTORS IS HILARIOUS. IF YOU ENJOY LAUGHING, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS DVD SET. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
1,"Off printing, case is is pieces, and the disk skips",The case was very poor quality with very bad printing along with the discs. Away from the poor printing and the brittle case the disk pauses and skips. Very disappointed.
5,Two and a half men Season 3,"I don't understand the realise policy of movie company's.In the US they will realise the dvd-set of season 3 on May 13, 2008.When in Europe they realised it on January 6, 2008.But season 3 was on the cable in the US in 2005/2006, correct?Why realise the dvd in 2008? Why wait so long?How many seasons did they already show on the US cable?When will I see season 4, because season 3 ended will a great cliffhanger!I hope they will realise the dvd-sets in the near future a bitt sooner.Regards,Rob"
5,Connie Again,"Viewed biography of Connie Francis on A&E television last night. Very interesting. Listening to her songs drew me back to the book (With Connie With Love) where her music and words run such a parallel current through the theme of love, loss and life. Both Connies life and the books ending speak of the hope and healing of time and the human spirit. Good show.....Good read."
5,More than romance and Connie Francis,"I enjoyed the romance of Robert and Rachel and I am a fan of Connie Francis, but the novel, With Love, With Connie, is more than that. It would do the novel an injustice not to mention its other merits. The creation of the villain, the antagonist, is well-sculptured, a most fascinating creation. We learn to loathe him; then the revelation.The novel is rich with literary references and Biblical references. All of us have talents that should be showcased; having the elderly aunts finally share theirs was reassuruing for all of us that it is never too late.The use of diaries is skillfully accomplished; their value is, in fact, an underlying theme. In the midst of tender passages, there can also be that wit, that satire that has a cutting edge. It never bleeds but it causes the reader to take note."
5,No Need For Censure,"The novel can be left unattended on a coffee table. No need to worry whether your children will read it or Aunt Grace if she visits or the minister or priest for that matter.And anyone who enjoys romance would have to find some pleasure in spending a few hours with Robert and Rachel.It may not be a classic in the making, but it will satify the need for an escape to a world where values count, people care and good triumphs in the end.Katherine"
4,Deviants - 'Disposable' (Captain Trip) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1968, as this was their follow-up to their debut 'Ptooff' lp (see my review) and nearly as good. 'Disposable' simply continues the feat of showing off Mick Farren's off beat sense of humor. With cuts like ""Sparrows And Wires"", ""Let's Loot The Supermarket"", the notable ""Slum Lord"" and ""Normality"", I personally thought that 'Disposable' was a true keeper. Line-up: Farren - vocals, Duncan Sanderson - bass, Sid Bishop - guitar and Russell Hunter - drums. Another outstanding late '60's UK piece of psychedelia to fully take in."
5,Great for Your Cell Phone,"I've been using this for months under my bike seat. It's worked out great. I inserted a piece of foam rubber, wrapping it from the top around the front and along the bottom. I slide my cell phone in and it's completely protected from banging around or being crushed in a fall.The reflective stripe is very bright."
3,Just sad.,"Although I have loved the other books I have read by Ms. Penman, this one had few redeeming factors for me.And though all her books include betrayal within families, this seems to be the main theme in this particular book. At the end, all I felt was sad; and a wish I had stopped with the second book in the series."
4,"Good ending to Welsh trilogy, but...","In ""The Reckoning"", Sharon Kay Penman concludes her Welsh trilogy, begun in ""Here Be Dragons"" and continued in ""Falls the Shadow."" This tale chronicles the conflict between Llewelyn ap Gruffydd and Edward I of England. Llewelyn shines here; as in ""Falls the Shadow"", I found this character to be amazing and utterly fascinating, and the love story between him and Ellen de Montfort was exquisite and poignant. Similarly, Daffydd ap Gruffydd's characterization was marvelous.Ms. Penman's tendency to allow fictionalized characters such as Hugh and Caitlin center stage, however, only detracts from her novel. This book is not for the faint of heart; the starkness of the ending, fictionalized characters aside, was something that stayed with me a long time. A very good book, if lacking the power of the other two in the trilogy."
4,Not My Favorite From A Favorite Author,"Truthfully, SKP is such a great writer I am pretty sure I'd enjoy reading her grocery list, but for some reason, Reckoning left me cold. The story was a protracted agony, as the reader will perceive (or run to Wikipedia) for the history. I am forever amazed at her sympathetic characterization of men, while her women seem to be on the shallow, brittle side. Of course they may also be victims of an era and class that so limited the scope of their choices. Even a weaker effort from this author is a worthy read."
2,Muddled,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. Ives' wild 4th deserves better treatment than this. Ozawa is known for making bad recordings with great orchestras and this disc is no exception. This was the first version I owned of Ives' 4th and I liked it enough to buy a second recording. Michael Tilson-Thomas' reading with the CSO is miles better than this, the detail, especially in the 2nd and 4th movements (the most rhythmically complex and difficult to conduct and perform) is brought out to a wonderful degree. Ozawa simply buries a lot of this. Furthermore, Ozawa does not bring out the American folk tunes and hymns that Ives so cunningly weaves into the overall fabric of this eclectic work. Tilson-Thomas does all of this AND manages to make the 4 movements cohere symphonically, something that not many conductors of this piece can do. Ozawa just flounders, frankly."
5,Spansih Death Traps,Absolutely required reading to keep you alive should you even think of entering a Stone Door / Spanish Cache site and livingthrough the day.Do not think this books shows ever type of attack one can encounter at a Cache / Mine site --but it gives you a dam goodchance of living through your encounter with the Spanish .Read this book as many times as needed until you can actuallypoint to the traps--as you walk near the Stone Doors--if you do not fully understand every trap in this book--study it more!!When one encounters the Cache sites they will throw at you everytype of attack and even ones not in this book--but this book--tries to show you the right way to enter a Stone Door--Mine /Cache site--and the principals to keep you alive--If you need a little help you know how to find me...
5,Surrender the stars,Great book! Loved the story line. Loved the characters. Wish that there will be more book with the family! Hope there will be a book about her sister mouette finding love again!!! We need more raveneau books.
3,Ehhhhh,"The first and third book in the series were much better than number two.I was disappointed.But, I like this author and will continue to purchase her books."
3,pedestrian novel,"Bell prefers telling to showing, and what she tells is often of no great interest. This book is an extended essay stocked with unconvincing characters; as an essay it is not bad, although unexceptional As a novel, it flops. In contrast, Francine Prose's Blue Angel succeeds as an academic novel showing evil as well as the ordinary campus culture that surrounds it."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Women who want to take control of their financial future should skip this book. Instead buy anything by Suze Orman. Any one of her books will give you more tools to equip yourself for handling money, since this book gives none.This book recycles old ideas about attitudes to money, but doesn't give you any information on managing money itself."
4,If you've had a love/hate relationship with money...,"If you've had a love/hate relationship with money...read this book. If you think money books are boring...read this book. The writer provides an easy, sassy and fun read on a topic that is usually difficult, pedantic, and sober. Durling has a great way of spinning an anecdote. The personal stories (hers and others') keep us (readers) intrigued and relating to the topic and situation. Her advice to make just one change is great...simple but brilliant! I already started making one change and that led to two...and so on. Read this book and feel smarter and more brave about a topic that scares most of us, whether we'll admit it or not."
1,Don't judge this book by its (front or back) cover,"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun and cool financial guide. However, it was littered with biblical passages, quotes, phrases and messages. Not being a devout Christian, I was more than a little put off. I got partway through and was so fed up that I gave up reading. This book is not advertised as a spiritual financial guide even though it is, so unless you're a gung-ho Christian, I'd skip it."
5,Great advice... A must read for all women who love to shop!,"This book was very enjoyable to read, which is not usually true about most finance books! Throughout the book, I found myself taking notes and underlining suggestions as to how I could apply to my life. The author uses examples from her own life, which makes the reader feel like she is your friend sharing her own personal advice."
3,We sure do love agressive women ....,"Alicia Brown, the wife of a young executive of a large corporation finds that waiting for her husband to move up the corporate ladder is more than she can stand .... so ..... she takes matters in her own hands .. and for that matter .... just plain takes em by seducing all the managers male and female assuring her husbands meteoric rise ....The interesting twist is that she begins to like what she does and it becomes her own kind of career ....Its an OK book but certainly nothing to write home to mother about ,......."
1,Low budget backyard filming,"Looks like this ""movie"" was filmed in someone's backyard. Do I need to say anymore? I laughed, but not with the movie, but at the director, the ""acting"" and everything else."
4,Pets are for...,"Julia, a great and sensitive mind.. coaxes your feelings and makes sense out of why we feel more loss when losing an animal than a close relative!Amazing...S"
4,Bues Kings are the Swing Kings,"MBK swing cats. No doubt. They've got all the clubs jumpin' and swingin' in Dayton and Cincinnati. This cd is awesome but I don't think it earned a 5 star because it doesn't compare to the rich and mellow sound of the Blues Jumpers, or the raw and hardcore sound of Royal Crown Revue. But this cd is a must have for any hep cat or kitten out there. So lace up your wing tips and saddle shoes and start swingin' to the Mighty Blues Kings."
5,Fantastic sound gets the feet a hoppin',"In the words of Dick Vitale,"" This is awesome , Baby!"". I'm an old Blues fan not really into swing who caught a track of"" Meet me In Uptown"" at the local record/video store. I'm hooked. Great sounding piano, bass and the voice mixtures are top notch. Highly recommended!"
4,Great Swing and a little Soul too,"This is a great swing style album, but there's also a really soulful tune called ""Loose Lips"" that's very reminiscent of the great bands of the late 50's & early 60's. You can currently hear this track on the real audio broadcast program ""Soul of the Web"" at the Music Sojourn web site."
4,Local Chicago favorites do classic jump jazz (mostly).,"Great to see live, they work the whole jump jazz nostalgia that no one under 60 has a real right to feel nostalgic about. This album is great, but the MBK's don't do much by way of original songs."
2,Just Decent,"This coffee is fine, but not really special. It is coated with oil, which generally indicates an artificial flavor enhancer. I was mildly disappointed. I am not sure this is the genuine Haitian Blue coffee bean."
5,Great Giovanni version,Brilliantly sung and played. A top-quality cd that inspired us all Mozart magic. A must-have.
3,Could be better,"NoiZfree Twin Binaural Hearing aid compatible headset is a very useful tool for hearing impaired people. However, its quality can be improved. I have bought two so far within last two year and in both cases cable that goes to the hook break just before the hook part. Either the cable should be improved or the joint should be changed. Otherwise, it has a good sound quality and works good."
5,Awesome in the best sense of the word,Everyone enjoys the suites but hearing the complete music in proper sequence is a powerful experience. The music and the story the play tells compliment each other to a degree the suites only hint at. If anyone believes Grieg was only comfortable writing miniatures (after the piano concerto) give this a hearing. One good example is a truly scary Hall of the Mountain King.
5,BB's best,"I know Barbara Bonney has too many of recordings through her whole career. But I also know that this Solveig singing by her is her best recording ever, despite the fact that I never heard *all* of her past recordings. Wikipedia English has a testimony for that on its BB entry. If a world law has made it mandatory that everyone must have his/her funeral music selected, I would choose this BB singing without hesitation nor doubt."
1,waste of money,"Do not but this product. It's flimsy, and easily breaks. It's not worth $15. It is a knock off of other bubble walls. If you are looking for a similar product then try the Fish Tank Aquarium Blue 14"" Bubble Wall Airstone w 3 Suction Cups. I own that one now, and it works like a charm. This Lee's product was a disapointment."
3,Not exactly what I was hoping for,"Due to an issue with my satellite dish, I didn't get to view much of Discovery's shark week this year, so I decided to purchase this blu-ray disc. Upon scanning through the chapters of the disc, I found most of the content to be reenactments of shark attacks, which I am personally not all that fond of. I find the acting to be terrible and cheesy. I was anticipating more educational and informational programs but unfortunately found these to be outnumbered by reenactments. If you enjoy these reenactments, by all means buy this. But if you're more into educational and informative content, you'll probably be better off with something else."
4,"Not for everyone, but the one I play most often","I'd guess that this must be the slowest recording of the Sibelius #2 there is. I think that the historic Kajanus recording would finish before Bernstein gets through the first movement. No arguing that this is eccentric and probably grates on some listeners, but then, I can't stand Gould crooning through Bach while twiddling a piano. But if you get the chance, at least listen to the opening of the second movement. I swear, I never heard the drum roll and low pizzicato actually MEAN something here before. This isn't a race through the woods - this is damned serious. In the third movement, you can actually hear the oboe play the same note nine times; most performance blur this.There are plenty of great recordings of this work (Szell, Kajanus, and Kamu, for me), but this is the one I keep coming back to."
3,Excessive and eccentric,"In his latter years Bernstein recorded super-slow versoins of this symphony, the Tchaikovksy 6th, and various Elgar pieces, including the Enigma Variations. They've been controversial ever since, and although I thought this was a very personal and interesting approach the first time I heard it, the tempos and the expressive manipulation really do amount to pseudo-profundity, or so I think today."
4,Missing Battle? :-(,I am a big fan of Kathleen Battle and the Vienna Philharmonic. The quality of the recording was excellent as is the case for all the New Year's Day concerts. The main reason I purchased this Cd was to hear Kathleen Battle. Although she is said to perform 3 selections this is not the case. Miss Battle only is present on one selection-Voices of Spring.
1,How?,"How can a book be credible if on the first page one of the characters says, ""C'on, guys....let's beat it""? That is completely modern slang. No one spoke like that in those days. And such a trite, cliche thing to say. ""Let's go"" gives more urgency. ""Let's beat it"" is teenage slang for let's just get out of here...imparts no sense of danger or urgency. These are people who were nearly captured....who were missed by sniffing dogs because they were hiding in bushes...also not credible!If you want to read a worthwhile book on this period, read ""The Unknown World"". Every American should read that book."
2,I expect better from Interweave,Simple is definitely the word to describe this book. The photography is gorgeous and the pictures take up most of the space.But the projects are contrived and poorly explained for beginners. A mix of retro hippie/today's young hip designs. There isn't one project that interests me nor is there any inspiration to be taken from these designs. I expect better books from Interweave Press. This one is a disappointment. I gave the same review for Color on Color by the same author.
2,Misleadingly pretty cover belies lack of variety and originality,"I'm also disappointed in Interweave for this book. I found this book a few years ago, but didn't buy it. Its cover always stuck in my mind, and I couldn't remember why I didn't buy it. So when I found it here, I was ecstatic... until it arrived and I looked through its pages. I was expecting so much more from this book, like intricate and delicate embroidery techniques on sheer fabrics and garments. Alas, 'twas not so. One project that really irked me was the purchased house slippers with purchased lace tacked on with decorative stitches. These ideas have been covered elsewhere, and with more time and effort put into them. Now I remember why I didn't buy this book the first time I saw it. Really very disappointed."
4,Decent book for novices,"The book explains the rules of chess from the ground up. It is not meant to be a text on chess tactics. However, it does throw in a nugget or two of information that might give a novice pointers on how to use tactics to win a game."
2,disappointed,"I read the revies for this book and though I had found what I was looking for. Unfortuantely, I didn't. I get my inspiration from pictures of other landscapes and from that point of view this book comes up short. Nothing really knocked my socks off."
4,Lets Go ...consistently one of the best,"I spent a year in South Africa in 98/99. The SA guide wasnt available before I left and I really wish it was. I saw it through others who came over after I arrived and it had current info and stuff you wouldnt find inthe other guides. Lonley Planet is good to have but I've found that a good chunk of the info is out of date. I'm going back to the area in June and the first book I got was the most recent edition of Lets Go South Africa. If your headin to southern africa get the Lonely Planet BUT dont forget to leave without your copy of Lets Go SA, its a tool you cant do without."
5,A unique perspective,"I found the book to be very interesting. The book gives an excellent account of the role played by the Wilmington harbor, and the forts defending it, during the Civil War. The extensive use of local materials and quotations give a unique perspective on the events. Walker helped me to see events thru the eyes of Wilmington residents."
1,Rehash of Gragg and Fontaine,"I received this book as a gift last Christmas. In my opinion, this book is nothing more than a rehash of Chris Fonvielle's (The Wilmington Campaign) and Rod Gragg's (Confederate Goliath)work. [...]"
1,Don't Waste Your TIme or Money!,"This is nothing more than a politically correct rehash with little basis in historical fact. It is obvious that the author wrote this to promote his political agenda. Since fantasy seems to be the order of the day for this waste of paper, perhaps the author should market it as a novel!"
1,This book appears to be a knockoff of a classic,"It appears to me that book footnotes Rod Gragg's Book ""Confederate Goliath"" so many times that it may as well be a copy of that book. Note the name of this book ""Rebel Gibraltar"" seems to be a careful play on words hoping to confuse the readers into think that this is really ""Confederate Goliath."" What little does not come from Gragg seems to come directly from Chris Fonvielle's The Wilmington Campaign. There is little in this book which is new. Justr a bunch or re-hashing of decondary sources. Do yourself a big favor and just read Gragg's ""Confederate Goliath."" It is a vastly superior book to this one in so many ways. [...]"
1,Poorly Written - A Real Knockoff,"This is just a knockoff of Rod Gragg's fine book ""Confederate Goliath."" In fact the name of this book is so close to the name of Gragg's book it appears seems to have been chosen in an attempt to to fool the public into purchasing the wrong book. If you want the A-1, premier book on the subject then ""CONFEDERATE GOLIATH"" is the book you want, not this one. Note that this book borrows quotes from Confederate Goliath but Goliath does not lean on this book at all. [...]."
1,WRONG MP3 DOWNLOAD!!!,The songs available on the MP3 download are completely different from the album! Someone needs to address this. Very poor.
1,Rollins' Cool Whip novel.....,"...all fluff, no substance! After reading several of Rollins' previous novels (and raving enough about them to friends!), I started this novel off by thinking I was almost guaranteed a great read. Not so. The characters were insipid and uninspiring---I couldn't care less what happened to any of them---and the plot line was just plain ludicrious. While there is some suspension of belief needed as a requirement to his novels, this one went over and beyond acceptable levels. Buckyballs in the blood? Antimatter? Invisibility? And what happened to those terrific cliff-hanging chapter endings? This novel was a waste of time and money. BOOoooooooooring!"
3,Interesting Book,"I enjoyed this book - I loved Rollins' description of the Arabia and the ruins; however, I could have done without what I thought was suppose to be his lead male character - Omaha Dunn. Personally, I thought him boorish and useless, as was the supposed love story. But, if you can ignore that sub-plot and just enjoy the Ubar plot, then this is a fun and interesting book."
4,"Great Start, Overlong Ending","Anyone who's read James Rollins knows what they're going to get: a rollicking adventure tale set in an intriguing environment with lots of action, lots of characters, and a peek into alternative history. Once again, Rollins delivers exactly that.Sandstorm starts off like all great thrillers do, it introduces all of the main characters and then brings them together at the end of Act One. In Act Two the characters band together to achieve their goal, but bad things happen, and the characters get separated. Act Three has the characters merging together in an effort to beat the enemy and the the elements. You know how it'll turn out, but it's so enjoyable you'll keep reading it anyway.The only thing keeping me from giving this book five stars is that Act Three goes on way too long. The final fight is overlong and could have been condensed by fifty or so pages.On to his next book!"
4,Great Story,I'm not done yet but this book is fast paced and hard to put down. I would highly recommend this especially for those who like other books in the sigma force series.
4,A fun read,A great story that is on par with his other books. Overall an enjoyable read. I love the characters that this author comes up with.
4,favorable,"Just finished reading this book. I did enjoy it, but have a couple criticisms. First of all, it is very long. Took me a while to get through it. Also, at times it was hard to follow, but there were many times I could not put it down."
4,A wild exotic ride,"This book is a fantastic read from start to finish. The ONLY issue I have is that the character Omaha could have been a little less Indiana Jones. Having his name be a State, and the author actually call him ""Indiana"" by one of the other characters is really not necessary. Other than that, I loved the whole book, and I loved the end. It will hook you in to the Sigma series."
4,It was action pack good fun,Love the character Painter. The science is of course not sound but still good fun. This could be made into a movie
4,Great blend of science and magic!,"Sand Storm by James Rollins is an international thriller that has Painter Crowe and his fellow Sigma agents fighting against time and the powerful, elusive Guild. The story is fast and the suspense unrelenting. The characters are a complex mix of introverts and extroverts that keeps the contrasts and conflicts between them interesting. There is some great science that the author manages to explain simply, making it easy to understand some of the complexities of antimatter and strengths of Buckyballs, as he skillfully mixes magic with technology. Men and women, Shamans and scientists, ancient and modern are all swept up in this breathless tale of saving the world from an ancient threat. Pitted against them are the men and women of the Guild, who want to capture and use this power to gain control of the world. They aren't worried about how much death and destruction they unleash, as long as they win the prize."
1,"Language, for one...","The swearing in this book went WAY overboard but even that defect was small in comparison to the drivel I had to wade through to get to the final outcome. I don't talk to myself often when I'm reading but this book forced me to shout on a few occasions, ""get to the point!"" I finally just flipped to the end. I know it was meant to be exciting but it all could have been said in 200 pages, max! My kingdom for a clean, concise, exciting novel. Books are a form of escape and it would be nice to escape from the coarse language we're forced to listen to in movies and now on television. We need a book rating system that will at least warn people of vulgarity. Until then, I guess the one-star rating will have to do."
2,Lacking Depth,"Sandstorm is the first James Rollins book I have read. I was a little disappointetd after reading the reviews. The characters seemed a little two dimensional so I found it difficult to become emotionally invested in the story. Being a bit of a science junky, I did enjoy the scientific complexities of this book, both the real and the fantasy.I think I've been spoiled, I keep looking for a replacement for my long-term love affair with F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack. Jack was awesome but alas, nothing good lasts forever! Unfortunately, I must continue the search, next stop, Lee Child's, The Killing Floor. I must find my replacement soon or I may have to enter rehab. If anyone has an author/book suggestion, please advise."
2,Goes downhill fast,"Wow, this one was tough to finish. What starts out strong, an Indiana Jones-style tale of treasure-hunting and puzzle-solving, devolves into a lengthy battle featuring asexual female soldiers inside desert cave constructed from randomly melting glass (or something like that). I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of fiction (the cause of the initial museum explosion, for example), but this was just too much. Combine the overly scientific passages (""the glass cavern with its energized antimatter solution is acting like a massive insulated superconductor"") and the insipid love triangle (he's in love with her after 15 minutes? really?), and this novel reaches its peak midway through. The rest is a mess.Now, I really only forced my way through Sandstorm so that I could get to Map Of Bones, the next in the series. Hopefully, that one turns out better."
2,Rollins is Falling...,"After writing such good science faction like Amazonia, Rollins has devolved into writing this bad piece, with a highly unbelievable storyline, an even more unbelievable plot, and the characters are again paper mannequins.Sandstorm is the story of the lost city of Ubar, with which the famous Queen of Sheba is also involved somehow. The story has some imaginative typical Rollins action sequences and nature-borne-surprises, but overall the story fails to elicit the kind of response that his other books have done.The cliche factor is a little toned down in spoken words, but not as far as stereotypical characterization is concerned. Rollins should seriously consider revamping his thought process, and introducing someone a little fresh and original in his stories.overall, no more than 1.5 / 5"
3,Plot a little too similar to Map of Bones,"I generally like Rollins books - even if they tend to be a little far fetched, but I can't get away from the feeling that a movie based on this book would be straight to video. I read Map of Bones before this book and liked it well enough, but the basic story line is really too similar to Sandstorm to read both of these books.Different groups compete to uncover long-hidden mystery (good guys vs. bad guys with a secret society in the background). When the secret is finally revealed, it is one of the great marvels of the world that is then immediately destroyed.Still a good enough book for the plane."
5,Fascinating novel - a real page turner,"James Rollins' novels have always been very, very good. But this one exceeds them all. This is not only due to his careful description of the characters, and here it is not disturbing at all that some of them are seemingly overdrawn. This story is fiction after all, and its author does not have to be restricted by a narrow realism. He even adds some supernatural elements which fit very naturally in the bizarre and hostile landscape the novel is set in. The atmosphere comes very close to that of a horror novel, and the plot is so full of suspense in all its twists and turns that you just cannot lay the book down. A remarkable, a really fascinating novel."
4,Rollins' Best!,"If you're a big fan of the non-stop action genre then James Rollins is a must read. Sandstorm is his best work yet. Following an explosion in the British Museum two close friends and a diverse supporting cast start off on an expedition to discovery a lost Arabian City.Lost civilizations, old fashion treasure hunts, doublt agents and even a little romance will prevent you from putting this down!"
2,much too wordy,"The basic plot and characters are fine, for an action/semi-science fiction book. But the writing style is awful in many places. Action scenes are bogged down by excessive detail. Characters stop in the middle of action to muse on some past experience, and the same memories are repeated throughout the book. Information is repeated in successive chapters, as though the reader will have forgotten what she read twenty pages ago. The book needed to be edited down to no more than half its length, in my opinion."
2,Not very engaging,"By far not one of his best works. The characters are paper thin and there are just too many of them. It was hard to keep track of who's who. The ""action"" sequences were boring and not really described very well, so it was hard to know what was really happening. Take a pass, read some of his other books."
2,Too Ambitious a Story,Too many characters with too much back story and too many enemies and too many scenes where you are left not quite sure what was going on. There was just too much going on all at once and chapter after chapter introducing new back story on another character in yet another country while the main story came to an abrupt halt. There was no opportunity to care about the cast of thousands. I didn't finish the book. About midway through I just didn't care anymore what happened.
3,Not among the best Sigma Force books but okay to pass the time,"This Sigma Force book wasn't exciting, in my opinion. It started out quite exciting but by the middle of the book the plot descended into something that had me quite listless and anxious to move on to something else.For the first book, I'm surprised Rollins made Painter seem like such a failure, because that's how it looked to me as his ex-partner was ALWAYS one step a head of him in everything."
5,Sandstorm,"I sat spellbound while reading this wonderful book by James Rollins, who is fast becomming one of my ""must read"" authors. I've always had a fascination for that part of the world, and to have an entire book dedicated to the rich history, plausible theories, and downright great action, was a total enjoyment for me.I would, without hesitation, recommend this book to anyone who loves stories with a 'hook' into the past history of ancient times. I applaud Mr. Rollins for yet another wild ride through literature."
4,Really good book!,"This book starts kinda slow, but it gets good and stays good. Because of this book and a friend, I plan to read all the sigma force book. And I love James Rollins books so far. The Blood Gospel was awesome!"
5,Sandstorm,"If you like spy and intrigue novels, you will love this one. It is intriging with its new type of heroes. It is imaginative with its locations. And, it's plot is a page turner. The plot stirs your imagination and makes you wonder ""what if"". I recommend this book highly."
1,Review,I still havent received the item purchased. Will submit a review as soon as i receive it.Thank you
3,Wordy and disjointed...this Sandstorm was tough to get through,"Having read all of James Rollins' previous novels, I couldn't wait to get my hands on ""Sandstorm"" and dive in. While Rollins did a good job setting the stage for the plot, I found myself soon losing interest in the story as I got 100 or so pages into it.Rather than waste your time with another plot synopsis of this book, let me just suffice to say that there are plenty of well-developed characters (a Rollins strength), but his over-wordy style took a book of about 300 pages and turned it into a 500+ page novel.If you're new to Rollins, start with any of his earlier works to get a better feel for his talent (and he is a talented writer).This reviewer's recommendations are in this order:1. Subterranean (his first and still best IMHO)2. Amazonia3. Deep Fathom4. Ice Hunt5. Excavation6. Map of Bones (to be read yet)"
2,Slow Read,I bought the books weeks ago and still haven't gotten through it. I keep waiting for the story to start. Not one of the authors best works.
5,sandstorm,i picked up sandstorm just for the cover and then realized it was by Frank Rollins. i love Collins books and have all of them. i was clued to the book for a nearly two days. it was slow at the beginning because i think i was in a hurry to start the adventure but after 100 pages then it got better then excellent. he also can stop putting swear words in his books. i do not like to edit my books as i read with inkout. destroys the drama. i will read it again a soon as i can get it back from the borrowers club of neighbors.
4,Fun read!,"I enjoy James Rollin's books. They are action packed! Although I do find them a tad far fetched, that's the fun of them. This one lived up to my expectations."
3,Sandstorm throws off too much dust,"See coachtim's review because I had exactly the same reaction to this new Rollins novel. Moreover, most of the horses die - and that is never acceptable to me."
2,Poor there it is,"Just to fanciful, seemed lime Rollins wrote himself into to many corners then just came up with silly little tools, gadgets or explanations to get himself out of it. I mean mini computers that can fly in hurricane force dust storms.I would call it a bond meets Indiana Jones (even that name is stolen in a way) meets Laura drift tomb raider."
1,"If you buy a Rollins book, don't buy this one first!",This is just not usual Rollins form. I got half way through the book before giving up on it. This is in stark contrast to all James Rollins' other books which I go out and buy as soon as they're available. In all his other books I find them very very difficult to put down. They are typically full of action and real page-turners. Sandstorm was very disappointing in this respect. Perhaps something interesting happens later in the book but when you bore yourself getting half way through a book it becomes a gamble to read the rest.
1,Morphs into boring science fantasy,"This books starts off as interesting fiction but gradually morphs into boring science fantasy. For example, the scene where the supposedly trapped female assassin removes her clothes and ""disappears"". At that point I quit the book."
2,The first half was great (minor spoilers)...,"The first half of this book was great--loads of action reminiscent of Indiana Jones. Then, the love story. Then the asexual reproduction. Plus, everything started getting repetitive. James Rollins, PLEASE stop putting love stories in your books. It's not your forte and it ruined both this book and Black Order. Honestly, if the completely unbelievable stuff, like going invisible or asexual reproduction had happened in the beginning, I would have put the book down right there. Same with the cheesy love story. This book started out as a potential new favorite for me (I love Indiana Jones style adventure), then it just turned into a dud."
4,Dan Brown meets Clive Cussler,"James Bond with an Indiana Jones Twist. Nice Hi-Tech gadgetry. Fast paced story line. The language is a little rough for my taste with the profanity a little over done, but a really fun ride."
3,"fun read, but corny at best","This is a pretty typical action/thriller that has all the usual ingredients. There's the treasure hunt, historical and mystical intrigue, technology/weapons, and young good looking people with ample sexual tension. The story's pacing is good and kept my interest, but the cheesy characters every so often slapped me out of the book. Characters named Omaha and Tony the Tiger? Are you kidding me? While I don't regret reading the book, I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. Rollins just isn't quite as good as top tier authors like Clancy, Crichton, Preston, and Child."
1,disjointed,Good idea but poorly executed. Plot jumped all over the place. Characters never were developed and would appear out of nowhere.Did not flow and story line did not develop it jumped from one action scene to the next with no ties or reason. Very disappointing. Iread about 70 books a year and I haven't read a book this bad in a long time.
5,phenomenal album,"i wouldn't know where to start really. following up an album as complete as Deadringer is difficult, but in all honesty this album is just as good if not better than the first. the most prominent difference between the two is the absence of guest artists. this is purely RJ at his best, without any of his friends from Megahurtz or Def Jux. not to say those guests are not welcome, but this 12 cut disc is unfiltered and raw hip-hop. from the booming funk of the title track to the crooning One Day closing up the album, this is not a dissapointment. pick it up, and chalk up another classic to RJD2. watch out Shadow, he's coming...."
4,"Quite eerie, but very well made","This album is actually a very odd,strange,and distorted record that has catchy hip-hop hooks and spooky techno pulses. Among the distorted melodies are many soundbytes and intro pieces that make rap dj's look like Mary Poppins. The best songs on this eerie, but entertaining record,are probably ""Through The Walls"" and ""Since We Last Spoke"" which are both poppy and rockish in thier own sense. This is a spookshow not to miss."
5,Since we last spoke,"Though vastly different from his previous album ""dead ringer"", rjd2 pulls it off again this time incorporating many different styles. Breaking more away from its hip hop roots, ""since we last spoke"" incorporates more funk,jazz, guitar riffs and such. All in all a very interesting album that was worth the wait for rjd2 fans."
5,RJD2's seminal album delivers,"""Since We Last Spoke"" is a pleasing blend of electronic music, hip-hop, and throwback sounds. This is by far my favorite ""Instrumental"" (some tracks have vocals) album and still one of my favorite albums of all time. The album is rare in that you can listen to it beginning to end and not ever have the urge to skip a track. I would recomend this to turntablists, aspiring rappers, or audiophiles who want to hear something alittle different.P.S. - I saw RJD2 live @ the 9:30 in D.C. when he was touring (I believe) in support of this album. It was earth shattering, go see him live if you can!"
4,"Nice, but can't beat deadringer","I have a lot of respect for RJD2, when i got his album Deadringer i couldn't stop listening to it daily. This release is also definitely worth buying, but not if you don't have Deadringer yet."
3,Convincing party spin,"3 1/2Minor rock-hip-hop-electronica innovations abound, especially when RJ is at his most melodically competent and experimentally restrained ala the title track. Occasionally drifting out onto block party style vacuousness and giving the feint vibe of trying harder to be unique then what is actually occurring, SWLS nonetheless comes chock full of engaging, and at times soulful, break-beating."
5,Great Album,"great follow up album, however a very different style then his 1st album. if you buy this album expecting to hear the same style as dead ringer then you will be unlucky. the style is completly different, but very good. the 2 problems that i have with this album is it is to short. you just want to listen to it over and over till you get sick of it and axiously wait for another rj cd to hit the stores. in this album you can tell that his skills are much more refined then in the last albume. he didnt make it as clutstered. if you are open to a new style then you will love this album. my favorite tracks on this album are One day, iced lightning, since we last spoke. if you havent bought this album then you should pick it up."
3,blah-wit-daba,"It happened with DJ Shadow; he busted his biggest wad on the first cd and with the second drizzled a mediocre amount of pearls and electronic sludge. The first RJD2 cracked me in the skull like an iron whip. This new album accosted me like the smell of day-old diahrea.What I love about 'Deadringer', which is the ambience of crackly vinyl and subtle composition, has been replaced by an unreserved, ""ey ma, look what i can do"" trickery which may impress hungry young backpackers, but for my own simple mind, it just doesn't connect on a level that makes me wanna listen to it more than once.That being said, I am not a turncoat. I respect the integrity of RJD2, and i am sure that a tremendous amount of thought and craft went into this album. There is something there, and I will find it. However, this album didn't have the same initial impact (at least on me) as the first one."
3,"Sadly, not that good...","Rj has been a true inspiration to me since I first heard Deadringer...and the wait for his Sophomore effort has been excruciating. However, it is finally here, and I am nothing less than disappointed. Rj barely even touches the turntables throughout the record, except in the end of track 7 and here and there where he simply slows down a track or fades it in and out. I find most of the songs on this album boring and repetitive. As much as I dislike this album, I did just see him live, and he did not disappoint. If you are a true RjD2 fan, get the album to support a great man, but if you are looking for a follow up album to Deadringer, don't set your hopes too high."
2,dissapointing,"Dead ringer is one of the best DJ albums ever produced. Everything RJ did with blueprint was amazing. I'm just not feeling this album. It sounds like something that would get lots of radio play in the 80's. There is no hip hop or turntables or guest appearances by skilled emcees. What there is is horrible voice samples and elevator beats. Track 1-4 are tolerable but I can't even listen to the rest of the album, in fact i think that track 5 is one of the worst songs ever put together. A lot of people enjoyed this album so i would recommend giving it a listen but i just wasn't feeling it."
4,"Different, but well done.","When I first read the title of RJ's latest album I was reminded of the Avalanches debut ""Since I Left You"". I had no idea that the music itself would be so similar.There should be no duplicity in the fact that ""Since We Last Spoke"" is far from the sort of hip hop most have come to expect from RJD2 and Def Jux. That being said, I still cannot say this is a bad album. It is fantastic record to simply put on your headphones and get lost in, like a Massive Attack record for example. Far from being ""elevator music"", it is a liquid soundscape that proves hip-hop DJs can provide more than loop a simple ""boom-bap"" of a beat.I would be a fool to say that RJ is the first to try and demonstrate the potential of a hip-hop DJ, however, RJ has succeeded in this endeavour where others (like Prefuse 73) have failed.Dead Ringer was better (slightly) but definitely a four-star effort."
3,I couldn't disagree more,"I really dislike the Tashi recording, precisely because it rushes. The early morning birds in that recording sounds like the LA freeway at rush hour! Although this recording doesn't get everything right (the Intermede is not quite light-hearted enough), the first movement is beautiful - not muddy at all. The ideal recording of this piece is the De Peyer recording made during the 70's, which doesn't even show up in the catalogs. If you ever come across it, run, do not walk, to the cash register. You won't be disappointed - it's legendary."
3,Not so bad!,"This recording was done ""in the presence of the composer and given his authorization"". This is positively not the best recording I have heard of the ""Quatuor..."" but the severe criticism of the other reviewers is probably a matter of taste. I really appreciate the (not too) slow tempos, and I think that the sixth movement could have been performed even slower. This piece is not a virtuosistic exercise. It expresses religious contemplation. Nevertheless, my personal preference is the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi recording with Aloys Kontarsky on the piano (as far as I know not available on CD)."
1,Inferior interpretation,"This interpration should be bypassed; it lacks clarity and movement. In particular, the first movement is horrendously slow and muddy; the birds sound as though they are waking up with severe hangovers. The other movements are hardly better. Buy the Tashi CD and revel in the brilliance."
3,False advertising.*edited,"The product pictured is a whole set of front and rear breaks - 8x padsReceived 4x front pads. no rear.****** edit ******I inspected it more closely, it looks like the extra 4 parts are the shim for the pads.Please update the description of this product to indicate that its just one set of pads , the photo is a bit misleading."
3,Not as Expected,"The price was alright and the transaction was easy, but the product is very stiff, which made using it a bit more difficult than I would have liked."
3,Coconut oil is great!,"The authors of this book have done a great service in bringing coconut oil to the attention of health conscious people. If you want to learn more about how to use coconut oil in your diet, you can also consult EAT FAT, LOSE FAT written by Sally Fallon who is a superb cook, and has included a wide range of delicious recipes. That book is also authored by Mary Enig, the leading expert on healthy fats who was 30 years before her time in pointing out transfats dangers."
1,dry reading,This book is nothing but a large advertisement. I was hoping for a little more information on how coconut oil helps your body but mostly this talked about how it was refined. I got half way through it and put it down. Maybe it got better.
1,you guys are thieves,i accidentally clicked to buy this pamphletit is a rip off and thereviewers that sung its praise are simply put accomplicesthis is only a fewpages of nothing more than a quick google search could providebe warned its a scam and karma is going to catch u folks that steal our moneyi never write reviews lke this fyi and peace to all of those who crave good health
5,A great book about a boy and a dog,This was the best book ive ever read deffinetly read this book if u need a good book to read
4,Quick Read,"A great, quick read for the busy actor chalked full of useful and pertinent information that will positively affect your decisions on and off the set."
3,Not bad at best.,"An enjoyable read, but not a huge amount of information. I gave my copy away. Somewhere there is a video that I've heard is great but is out of print."
3,Hmm.,"Well....it was nice of Caine to share his experience...but...I'll never read it again or took much good advice from it, as opposed to David Mamet's - True and False."
2,Michael Caine review,"This paperback did give some basic information that any mature adult should already know. Show up on time, be humble, know your lines, be sociable with others you're working with...I already knew all this though working in the corporate world."
5,"Pleasing Read for Aspiring Actors, Writers, and Directors","I have been in the production business for last 6 or so years now. And I have been recently interested in studying more about acting and the actors perspective, so who better than Michael Caine's viewpoint.To hear real accounts of movie set experiences and his approach to the craft of acting gives a student of the business a hands on perspective of what to expect as an actor and some insight to the movie making business.- Thanks Mr. Caine"
5,Filled with pracical suggestions!,"Often when studying acting, you get tied up with all the aesthetics. And when you take your grasp at acting, you're lost. You focus on the aesthetics, but when you TRY TO ACT it's a different story. Thank God for this book! Filled with practical suggestions that help A LOT. It tells you what to do and how to do it without confusing you. For instance, Caine writes about how powerful the expressionless face is. I remember when I rehearsed for a monologue written by David Mamet, I video taped myself doing it with an expressional face and without it. Surely enough, the latter was better. Thanks Michael Caine, you're a great help!"
4,"For What It Is, Wonderful--but not really an acting book","Caine's book is informative and entertaining, full of practical advice for anyone seeking a career in film. The title may be a tad misleading, though, because this isn't really a text about acting. ""Working as a Film Actor"" may have been a more appropriate title.To really learn a process of acting that goes beyond ""tricks of the trade"" (be it on stage, in film, or in any venue or medium) I'd recommend reading the signature titles of Uta Hagen and Stella Adler. THEN read Caine's book to get some perspective on the ins and outs of working specifically in film."
4,Great Book for the Actor!,I really enjoyed reading this book. This is a wonderful book as it tells you all about the difference between being in the theatre and being in front of the camera. Very different mediums that the actor needs knowledge to approach. I would suggest this book to any actor at any stage of the game.
4,Excellent source of information about Aaron,"This is a very good book. McCorduck is an excellent writer (I also recommend her ""Machines Who Think"") who tackles the fascinating area of AI art. Information about the art-generating program Aaron is hard to come by and this book is the best source I've encountered so far. The history of Harold Cohen is a fascinating read.I would have liked to have seen coverage of more AI art makers, but perhaps Aaron is the only one worth considering. For more on AI art in general, see Boden's ""The Creative Mind.""Way to go Pamela!"
1,Bad Buy,"I got this on the hope of hearing some actually scary stories. Instead, I got a bunch of drivel that isn't even suitable for children.The only slightly interesting one was Transformation, but even it lacked any real story line (and the ending was laughable). The others where just inane in general with their plots, imagery, and readings."
4,An Excelent Marley Album,"Bob Marley has many bootlegged albums, and alot of them arn't too good. However, this is one of those albums that really comes together nice and sounds great. The sound quality would get a 7 out of 10, but it is a cd that you can listen to over and over again."
3,GREAT SONG,"This has to be one of the greates songs that i have ever heard. This one just pumps you up no matter what mood your in. This one is up there with other great songs like sandstorm by darude, freestyler by bomfunk mc's. Everyone should own this song."
5,British Comedy At It's Best!,"The other reviewers have really said it all. This is a genuinely funny British Clsssic where you get Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas! The scenes with Thomas and his suspecting wife were very amusing and Sellers shows what a master comedian he really was. Actually, everyone in the film shines. If you want 'laugh out loud funny' this is it! It's also a fun film to show to friends who have not seen it."
2,Silly British Comedy,"This is a lightweight British comedy about the victims of blackmail and their attempts to do something about it. Although the cast does fairly well, the plot hardly is worth bothering with. The picture is dark in many places and the dialogue can be a bit hard for a non-British audience."
1,I saw and looked at this book. It's worthless.,"David Stanley doesn't know as much as he thinks about Elvis Presley. I could write a better book about Elvis then he did and I never met the man. This ""book"" is a joke at best."
3,It could be better!!,I would encourage one to buy Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew instead of this book. The vowel marks of this book are definitely awful and besides that the transliteration of the Hebrew words are not helpful at all.
2,Has the answers I need but Bad Printing job!!!,This book would have been great had the printing been better. It is so bold one can't make out the vowel marks. Has the transliteration but that is a hassle compared to just reading the Hebrew. Shame on publishers and sorry this took away from the authors hard work.
1,Endless Love,I was very disappointed in this cd. These were not the original recordings and none of the songs even had words. It sounded like elevator music. I do not recommend this cd and will never listen to it.
2,Good start for beginner level stock analyst,"The beauty of the book is it is small, language is simple to understand and you will never feel boared.Though I would recommend this book for beginner level investors who want to introduce themselves with the stock analyst career.ThanksSunny"
2,Nothing new ...,I would have expected more details in this book but unfortunately I was not very impressed. It all felt like old news.
1,"This book is bad, bad, bad....","This book is missing a lot of information i.e.: how to know if a company is carrying too much debt? isn't this a very important calculation???If you are serious about buying individual stocks, read ""Security Analysis"" by Ben Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor)"
1,Buffett Does NOT Follow The Techniques In This Book,"This is one of the worst investing books I have ever seen. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the way Warren Buffett actually invests, it completely makes up investing methods.For instance, the book talks about discounting future streams of income. The Oracle of Omaha was quoted at a Berkshire Hathaway meeting as saying he NEVER uses discount future cash flow.Even worse, this book promotes ""book value growth"" as a method for evaluating a stock's worth. Book value is an accounting term representing the net equity for a firm on ONE PARTICULAR DAY IN TIME. Change the date of the balance sheet and the value calculated by book value growth may change dramatically.If you want to invest like Warren Buffett, check out The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham."
1,looks nice but bad quality,"I bought this fish tank seven months ago and have gone through three pumps (which I had to buy through the company because I couldn't find one at any local stores) and four light bulbs. I have had fish tanks for years and never had the problems that I have had with this one. It looks nice when I works, but the top leaks and god forbid the power goes out in the house because restarting the pump is a total nightmare. I wouldn't buy this fish tank again."
1,It's a mistake,"This item is shown as compatible with the Nuvi 650 and isn't. And the supplier, to whom Amazon refers you, is non-responsive. Money down the drain."
1,Misleading Title for Bally Dance - It is NOT Belly Dance at all!!!!! Even she says it in the video!,"So dissapointing when instructors try to piggy back on trends.She calls it Belly Dance inspired Bollywood fusion. All nonsense.It's not bollywood, it's not belly dance. It's ""something"" crammed in for aerobics.I am not a Bollywood expert, so I don't know if you can call this bollywood at all.But I am an expert both in belly dance and fitness instruction.While it may be a good heart-pumping workout, if you are wishing to dance or even slightly belly dance, please do not pick this one up.Otherwise, clear instruction, pretty motivating personality and good amount of variety and fast movements are available for the workout enthusiast - not the belly dancer or an intermediae dancer...Deserves 1 star due to the absolute misleading title."
3,Does what it's supposed to do.,"As someone who does do Middle Eastern dance, this DVD kinda irritated me. It was a good workout but the moves are sometimes un-natural and not at all like bellydance. However the purpose of this DVD is to help you burn calories, not learn how to bellydance. I would suggest instead : belly dance cardio, or bellydance with jillina."
1,Not a favorite,"First of all I've never seen anyone sucessfully belly dance in sneakers - this is a crappy DVD, I wish I'd have kept the packaging to send it back- this is the worst DVD I think I've ever wasted money on."
2,Mountaineering for Dummies: Misprints and Bad Decisions.,"I found this book to be a fast-paced and entertaining read. Yet at the same time, I felt that there were certain errors and omissions from the text that detracted from the story. For instance, At one point Dickinson makes reference to Reinhold Messner as, ""Reinhard Messner"".I also strongly question the Author's judgement based on the account of events above the second step. When he (and the Sherpas)notices that his Partner Al Hinkes is no longer following closely behind. The two climbers had already made the poor judgement to continue climbing without fluids (Both men were carrying 2 quarts of juice that had frozen). Although things worked out in the end, I do not agree with Dickinson's decision to continue climbing potentially leaving his partner for dead.If the reader were to take anything away from this book it should be, ""This is what not to do."""
2,"Good, but no Into Thin Air","Compared to Into Thin Air this book is disapointing. Compared to The Climb this book is a little better. There's just no passion comming through from the Author. There was also much to much time and space devoted to the author and his relationship with his wife. I read adventure books(real or fiction) for adventure. I could care less about someones marital problems when reading a book about Mt Everest. The author also falls short in his discription of the actual climb as it related to his position on the mountian. I kept refering back to the map (within the book) to try to figure out where they were at any given time. In Into Thin Air you new just where old John was on the mountain most of the time. As Everest books go this one was not bad, but I don't think I will reread it as I did with Into Thin Air."
3,"Pretty good, hard to get into, then very gripping.","I liked it alright, when he actually got onto the mountain. I did enjoy all the background, though, because it helped me understand the horrible plight that the climbers experienced on May 10. People say that Dickinson is a whiner, but I think his frank telling of his story only added to the helpless feeling the reader felt for all the climbers. Over all, I liked it, though I'd much rather read a John Grisham book any day."
5,"perfect, exactly what I needed and rapid shipping",What can I say... it fit perfectly. Seemed to work fine and I replaced an Accel cap and rotor that worked fine too. I expect the same positive experience
3,A potpourri of.....stuff.,"One thing's for sure. You read this book from cover to cover and you'll be one knowledgable student. It's loaded with information about endocrinology. Unfortunately, it's also loaded with extraneous information, some of which is most likely irrelevant to what your endocrinology professor is trying to teach, i.e. human endocrinology. Moreover, this excess info makes you have to search long and hard to get to the information you're looking for! But in general, it's a good book. I give it two snaps up and a circle."
2,I need a new endocrinology text,"I've been using various editions of Hadley for quite a few years in the upper division/graduate level general endocrinology course I teach. I've never been particularly enamored of it but it's general and pretty comprehensive. Although the lectures I use have been generated and updated using Hadley and other sources, in checking my notes (PowerPoint pres.) this year I've noticed a number of glaring errors (see p. 317 for the most egregious/amazing; ""...NE contracts the heart and forces blood out into the circulatory system. Acetylcholine, on the other hand, relaxes the heart so that it can again fill up with blood."")So, if anyone can recommend a good general (although a previous reviewer refers to Hadley as being 'comparative,' it is not ... and I've largely ruled out Norris [too comparative] and Nelson [too behavioral], though both are fine books) Endo. text let me know. I'm in the biology dept. at the u. of Memphis."
1,endo paths where?,"Endocrinology, yeah I said it! Now can you say Feed back loops, positive/negative feed back systems, graphs, and charts? Well this book may talk about them, but it surely doesn't give any pictorials about the plethora of systems your body has in them. I bought another book, which helped out much more in understanding how cholesterol turns into Andro, and which enzymes help it along the way."
3,"mediocre book, but a leader in comparative endocrinology","I found this book to be rather scattered in organization and poorly written. Color text and/or diagrams would improve the look and readability of the book. As a general endocrinology text, I would not recommend it. However, despite its shortcomings, it IS probably one of the best comparative endocrinology books on the market and should be a valuable addition to a comparative physiologist's library."
4,Comprehensive textbook.,"The layout of this book make it very easy to use as a textbook or reference source. The clinical examples are very useful to those with a medical interest. The author offers a comprehensive, no nonsense aproach that gets the job done."
3,Paying for extraneous information,"There's tons of information in this book. Much of it, however, is irrelevant to most endocrinology courses. To get to the information you do need, such as mechanisms of hormone action, you have to sift through countless lines of impertanent junk! Despite this problem, the book is well written and particularly easy to understand, hence my 3 star rating."
2,"brevity is the soul of wit, and this ain't it","I was forced to buy this book for a mixed undergrad and graduate endo course. While this book is long on info, it really doesn't work for the course I am taking.... I often reference my biochem and cell bio texts in order to get the full picture. Hadley is also overly wordy, to the point that it can get cumbersome and confusing."
2,Insufficient help for learning,"On the whole, this textbook is poorly organized and contains a lot of frivolous information. There is often a lack of cohesiveness in explanations of the concepts and models. My professor's lecture notes were much better than this textbook. Granted, if you were to spend significantly much more time with the textbook like I did, you will eventually adapt to the authors' style, but the lack of clarity and cohesiveness in the explanations was mildly a debacle. Hours can be saved by simply going to your professor's office hours for questions.So, I would say save your greenback and invest your time more wisely than reading this textbook."
3,decent textbook,"Bought product as a book for an undergraduate course. Some of the material is not as update as you would like, but its a decent reference book about endocrinology. It has decent pictures, but can be tedious to read at time. Good to have on your book shelf in case you need clarifications or general ideas, but not especially great for most up to date information."
4,Good book for future Restaurant Management professionals,"I ordered the book to read about Restaurant Management more out of curiosity than actual contemplation of working in the field. I have a management background in another field and found this book to be a very informative read. I'd highly recommend it. The authors deliver a legitimate ""How-to"" book that would be a valuable companion for even seasoned restaurant managers....no fluff, all nuts & bolts."
4,No too bad,"Not a bad book on restaurant management. They focused alot on concepts and startup operations which alot of it is very good. However, some of the information is a bit out of date. Furthermore, the book does have the basics which most restaurant managers will need for this initial analysis."
5,Handy Reference,"Great reference for someone new to BH. Includes topo maps and clear directions on how to get to the trails. Also has good writeups on each area, with details on the specific trail to follow. When checking ratings, keep in mind these are experienced hikers... you may have a hard time if you're new or out of shape. I take it with me every time I head out."
3,Not a book for mountain bikers,"This book focuses mainly on hiking trails, so if that's your thing this is the book for you. It would benefit greatly if each trail entry was _clearly_ listed with it's approved uses. The index also needs a section under each activity, that way you can look up 'mountain biking' and find references to every trail they review where biking is allowed. Some of the reviews of the trails are questionable ... the trail from French Creek Horse Camp to Iron Creek is not ridable at all for mountain bikers, in my opinion, not even close, yet it's listed as 'an exciting mountain bike ride through the park's remote northern end'. I have no idea what they were thinking. Like I said, probably a better book for hikers than bikers, but still a good resource just to give you a hint as to what's available in the area and get you started. If biking is your thing, stick to the trails listed as having cross country ski access as well as for biking and you'll get some nice single track love."
5,one of the best books.,"This book is one of the best books ever written. It is very easy to read and there are many illustrations to help understand. I really enjoyed this book then I'm planning to give a present to my nephew. If you think you are a biker, Hiram's book is a must. Thanks."
3,"Well, that was depressing...","I guess I missed the point. I agree the cinematography was well shot in all its diversity. The acting is solid and believable. And the film is realistic.But in the end it seemed to me to be filled with colorfully filmed random acts of violence interpersed with a rant-filled commentary by a radio DJ about the insanity of it all. Nothing profound or earth shattering, just pointing out the obvious.Life is violent. Death comes to all. Don't know where, when or how. There ya' go. Just imagine this message played out for about two hours in the sunshine of L.A.Guess I missed the hope and inspiration part because after watching this for two hours what lingered was not a greater appreciation for life, as some reviewers seem to have found, but two hours I could have spent actually doing or reading or viewing something inspiring or hopeful.If I wanted a film about ultra-violence I'd watch A Clockwork Orange again."
4,Amazing first effort!,"Frank and Scott put together a truly wonderful debut film. I saw a preview and loved it. Very true to life. Passionate performances by all of the actors. Definitely worth checking out. Watch out for Frank and Scott; they're going places!Frank BernsteinPalo Alto, CA"
3,Every Recipe took too long before you could bake.,"Every recipe seemed like you always needed to refrigerate your dough for a very long time before you could actually bake, then enjoy. A lot of the recipes called for specialty items that you just can't go to the local grocery and buy. Laura sells these items on her own out of a magazine. I am thinking of ordering some just so that I can try these recipes but the prices are a bit high."
5,Impress your guests with fabulous unusual treats!,I just made the triple chocalate babka - very good but took a long time to get to the finished project. The recipes are nice and tasty but time consuming so start in the morning if you want something by dinner!
1,Not a fan,"I've tried a couple of recipes from this book over the many years I've owned it and they've both been less than impressive. Part of my frustration is that each recipe has different directions and ingredients depending on the model of bread machine you own, leaving you really stuck if your machine isn't on the list. (Or if models have changed since 1994.) This also means that there aren't a lot of recipes given the size of the book. Ingredients are expensive and in my case, wasted.If you're looking for dough recipes that you can finish by hand and monitor, this book might be fine. (I haven't tried any of those.) I've had much success with other bread machine recipe books, but this one is heading for the donation bin."
1,Not for me...,I purchased this book. I don't recommend it. The recipes include ingredients that are difficult to find and expensive if you do find them. I gave my copy to a culinary arts student. She also finds it to be unrealistic for home cooks. I wasted my money on the book. I'm not willing to waste more on ingredients. Ms Brody needs to provide substitutes for the expensive ingredients she sells.
3,ok,This game is very complicated and hard to play. You have to read all of the instructions and actually practice playing it before you can enjoy it. Once you can understand everything without having to review the rules it is great for fans of the show.
4,faith no more returns,"Forget king for a day, this is Faith No More. That had to be another group playing on that other album. This album rocks, especially 'Last Cup Of Sorrow' and 'Ashes To Ashes'. If you bought king for a day and were disappointed, give them another chance with this CD, their second best. (after Angel Dust)"
1,"Don't do it ,man","If you're a die hard FNM man, you'll be dis-satisfied with this album. It has a quasi ""Angel Dust"" ""tone"" to it, but it just doesn't cut the mustard and falls flat on creativity. I almost got the feeling that they really didn't know what to do with the music they were playing. It was all over the place."
3,I need to give this album more of a chance.,"Most people like it more than KING FOR A DAY, but it never grew on me. It's heavier, to be sure, but I really need to hear it more often, like KING FOR A DAY.ANGEL DUST is still their best album."
3,Too Bad Jim Martin Left,"FNM really lost alot when Jim Martin left. The last two albums just have such bland guitar riffs.I like what Patton did on his first two FNM albums, but FNM turned into MR. Bungle II after Martin left. Mr. Bungle's style is just too weird, experimental & annoying, Martin's riffs sounded like a friggin war going on on all those songs, which was awesome. The songs were just alot more tighter & you could headbang to them. Wish they would regroup with Martin.This album is decent, but I'd probably buy this one last of all their other discs."
5,The End of The Best,"With this amazing and undescriptible album, Faith No More ends his productive and breath-taking career. This was thier perfect final album. With the keyboards from Angel Dust and the guitars from King For a Day, they made their most balanced CD. The songs are so impressive, that can't be defined with words, you just have to listen to them. But, anyway, I would like to talk about every song of the album with just one word for each one:- Colission: Speed. - Stripsearch: Loneliness. - Last Cup of Sorrow: Thick. - Naked in Front of the Computer: Hardcore. - Helpless: Acoustic. - Mouth to Mouth: Oustanding. - Ashes to Ashes: Guitar. - She Loves me not: funny. - Got that feeling: Scream. - Paths of Glory: Darkest. - Home, sick Home: Strange. - Pristina: death.Their second best album (their best is Angel Dust)."
4,Album of the Year Review,"After listening to this album, I would have to say that songs two and three truly blew my mind, and the album as a whole was certainly worth adding to my collection of music, if only for those two cuts. ""Stripsearch"" and ""Last Cup of Sorrow"" is a strong one-two punch that should be listened to at high volume."
4,"Faith no more, amazing","In My Eyes, ever since Patton Joined Faith no More, they can do no wrong. While this being my least favorite album by them, it is the LEAST BEST, meaning that it is all amazing, but it isn't as good as angel dust or The Real Thing.This being the Last Faith No More album really comes with alot of emotional baggage. The singing is amazing and ballads fill this album to the brinks. Get this and you'll understand WHY everyone likes faith no more. Pick up Mr Bungle while you're at it."
1,"Pathetic, plain and simple","This album is a mockery of Faith No More's past work. How can they call this ""Album of the Year""? It's one of the worst albums I've ever popped in my CD player. I am the biggest Faith No More fan going. I have numerous imports, posters, every single other CD, etc. and I have to say that this album is pitiful. They did the right thing in splitting up.. they were done for. This album proved it."
2,Don't let the title fool you,"When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called, ""Album of the Year"", I got pumped. I knew ""King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime"" was a flop, so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track. I was sadly mistaken. This album, to my amazement, got very good reviews at the time it was released. I just didn't see it. ""Last Cup of Sorrow"" was a decent song, as was ""Ashes to Ashes"", but other than that, I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs, most of them being more on the weak side.This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang, with ""The Real Thing"", and ""Angel Dust"". Two remarkable albums. I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things, but if you call Mike Patton's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music, all power to you."
2,A Handfull of Great Songs . . .,"Some of which include ""Stripsearch,"" ""She Loves Me Not,"" ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""Helpless,"" but the overall album feels very lackluster and cold. Whatever spark FNM had before this had died off almost completely by the time they made this, and much of it feels forced, painfully at times.This is interesting when you consider that many of the songs could in some way be about the band coming to grips with the fact that their beautiful collaboration was ending, but not very enjoyable to listen to on the whole. (Also, I seem to be in the minority here among FNM fans, but I preffered Trey Spruance's virtuosic yet classy and restrained guitar to that of Jim Martin or their third guitarist.)Anyway, not bad or awful by any means, but the only time I've heard Patton sound like his heart just wasn't in the material he was singing, which is a shame indeed. He (and the rest of the band) called it quits at just the right time, for just the right reasons."
5,Amazing!,One of Faith No More's best albums! So glad I decided to download this. You know it's good music when every song is your favorite at one point.
4,"Fun, especially as action figure is included with the vehicle.","My 8-year-old son loves this toy and couldn't wait to get one. It's a terrific representation of the small walking scout vehicles seen in Star Wars Episode III, and with some AA batteries this toy will actually walk, if a bit more awkwardly than the ""real"" thing. Sold from about $15 to $20 depending on where you find it, it's a better deal and more unique than some of the other vehicle toys released for Episode III, especially since the action figure of the driver comes with the vehicle."
5,AT-RT rocksss!!!,"In my opinion, this toy is the best strike force vehicle (next to the BARC Speeder.) My only complaints are that the pilot is in a permanent sitting position ( though they are coming out with a basic figure of it) and the walking action is less than what I expected. Other than those minor problems, this toy rocks! I'm gonna get two more!"
2,Disappointed.,"I had high hopes, but was greatly disappointed. The book came all the way from India, and was damaged upon arrival.Pictures were of poor quality (remember, this is the age of high resolution digital photography). Content was good but not comprehensive. I have used it, but I have also gone back to my good old standby reference texts that I have had for years.The price was high for a poor quality book."
2,find better for your money,"This album is a pretty cheap collection of Sousa marches, but that's all it is - a cheap album. You get what you pay for, and this is no high-quality disc. You can buy this if you want to hear tempo problems and wrong notes. If you want to hear good Sousa performances, buy something else!~C~"
3,Not the one for me,"Yes, the playing is lovely, such as it is. But the main thing I was looking for was the piano duet in the Dolly Suite, which is after all music for four hands... not an orchestra. So I should have been more careful. To me it is also played way too fast. Can't recommend this."
5,Wonderful,"I grew up watching The Lion, The Witch,and The Wardrobe. I read the whole series a few years ago. I decided to refresh my memory of these books by buying them on compact disc. It was worth every penny. I play them for my young daughter now as well. Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful!,"If you are going to buy a set of Narnia books, this is THE set to get. The color illustrations are beautiful, and the crisp white pages won't yellow over time. I agree with previous reviewers who are upset about changing the chronology, but that doesn't take away from the beauty of these books. If you buy this set or any other set, do yourself a favor and read them in the order that was intended by C.S. Lewis."
3,Great Stories but Original Publication is Best!,"I have searched high and low and discovered that the Chronicles of Narnia can not longer be obtained in their original publication order which is far superior than the current order. Even Lewis' writing within implies that the first book should be the LWW NOT MN, for in the LWW he suggests that Aslan the Lion has never before been encountered, but if the order reverts to the current one, then this statement rings hollow since Aslan was previously encountered in MN. Reading MN gives too much away about the magical wardrobe and other things when such things are more satisfying learned much later as Book 6 instead of Book 1. For this reason, I will not purchase a modern set because they all are numbered according to the latter order and not the original publication order. For this reason I give it three stars instead of five."
5,Great series,The product was a gift for a young high school age cousin and their joy at receiving this was over-the-top. Great series that I love. Great gift.
3,cheap set,"If you just want to read the books and toss them, this is the set to buy. The books are wonderful for all ages 10-100. This is not a boxed set for a collector though. The books and the box are cheaply made and will not stand up to much use."
5,"A captivating series, but not necessarily about God.","C.S. Lewis captured my imagination when I first read these books a few years ago at the age of 17. I was holed up in some faraway country where I couldn't speak the native language, but at night before drifting to sleep, I was able to travel to a faraway world where everything was an entirely new experience with characters that you develop strong bond with. Some may like to pound the Christian element into this series of books, but don't feel alienated from reading this books if you disagree. These are fantasy novels that can be enjoyed by anyone of any or no particular religious background. No child or adult should be deprived of an unforgettable journey into the incredible land of Narnia"
4,inspirational and magnificent,I loved then as a child and have reread all of them as an adult. Timeless classic for the entire family.I recall the days PBS aired this wonderful stories.
2,For this boxed set only,"As has been stated previously, this is printed ""out of order"", that is not a big deal as far as I am concerned, I just read them in the order I want to.I was VERY disappointed in the binding. These books cannot be read twice because the pages fell out of the binding. I love reading, especially in bed at night. I read 5 to 8 books a week. I am careful with paperbacks so that they stay together for reading after reading after reading. 3 books in this series lost pages.Covers were nice, with the metalic effect. Would have preferred they spent the money on the quality of the books."
5,Love it!,I bought two sets. Sent one to my 29 year old daughter in New Mexico and one home to my 24 year old son. They both have enjoyed listening to the set. Well worth the money that I paid for it.
4,It's the inside that counts,"The book was a little dirty on the outside, but everything else was great. I just wiped the dirt off the cover and was good to go. I love the story. It's great for any age."
5,The Best Trilogy of Books Ever Written,"Everybody who has ever read these books knows that they aren't in the proper order. But everybody also knows this error doesn't take away from the originality and genuine interest that these books have drawn. From the minute I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe I vowed to finish every book in the entire series. I didn't even read them in the order that was written on the books themselves. I probably read them in the most awkward order imaginably. But that didn't take away from my enjoyment of every story, and each one was better than the one before. And even though I do have my favorites, I think that each book alone deserves to be in a class by itself."
5,i thought it was a great book,It was a wounderful book. It had so much suspence for me. THe books also had lots of action
5,Narnia boxed set is great!,"In anticipation for the new ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movies, I decided to finally read all of the Chronicles. I had read ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in the past and loved it, but I never went any deeper into the other books. I'm happy to say this collection is available and very affordable. Although there is much discussion about the order of the books, (there are in fact 4 different ideas) I find the chronological order fine only if you have read ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in the past. That novel should always be read first. The size of these books are very convenient (pocket-size) and the illustrations add to the storytelling. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who would like to get a jumpstart on the future movies or to those who would just like to have a ""time out"" in Narnia."
2,Publisher has taken terrible liberties,"You said it, neilicus107. That the publisher would reorder these books according to their boneheaded idea of chronology is an outrage. It's no different from taking all the flashback parts from a book or a film and putting it at the beginning. I'm glad that I still have my old Penguin edition, and will be giving that to my nephew instead."
5,The Magician's Nephew,"I read this book with my son, it was so cool. It told how Narnia began and about how the wardrobe came about. It is a shame some of this was not added to the Disney movie."
5,The Chronicles of Narnia,This is my first foray into the world of 'review' but I must have my say. All of the positive remarks about these wonderful stories are inspiring. I envy all of you who read them as children. I was in my early 30's sitting by the shore with my then 9 year old son( prior reviewer Peter O'Malley) when I first read C.S.Lewis. I have always cherished this time spent with my son and credit this series of books for fostering in him a voracious need to read and in myself the desire to look at life through a veil of child-like fantasy. Who needs to grow up!
5,It Doesn't Get Better Than This!,"Between ages 10 and 14 or so, I kept track of the number of times I'd read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe on the backside of the back cover--my hash-marks total 63 readings. The book was -that- good! The rest of the series is great, too, of course, it's just that the introduction really got my attention! As good as the movie is, the book really is better, and I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the entire series."
2,"Fabulous books, horrible presentation","The two-star rating is most emphatically *not* against Lewis's writing--the books are utterly and completely fabulous.This particular presentation, however, is hideous. Lewis wrote the seven books in a particular order on purpose--the first was _The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe_, _The magician's nephew_ was intended as the sixth in the series. (There are other titles that were placed in a different order than this particular set, too.) Apparently, though, the publisher thought that the fact that this runs out of chronological order would be too confusing for readers, and so changed the order around. By doing this, the publisher ruined some of the effect of reading the series in its proper order."
3,Great book but many illustrations missing,"I bought this particular compilation for my 7 year son, and went along with the chronological order of the books. There's already enough said about that in other reviews. What surprised me the most however was how few of the original illustrations were included, only one per chapter in fact. Given how much the Amazon review touted the illustrations, I was very disappointed."
5,Better Than I Expected.,I ordered this book a few days ago and was shocked at how fast it came; even faster than the earliest delivery date!The book is much nicer than I expected and looks WAY more expensive than the 23 dollars I paid for it.Great transaction and fast shipping. :)
5,Great Books,"I bought this for my 10yr. old daughter who proceeded to read it in a little over a week. The life lessons in these books as well as the spiritual values are refreshing when most of the books aimed at our children today are centered around glorifying vampires, witches, zombies and such."
3,A bit boring if you have seen the movies,"I was pretty excited to start reading this book to my 9 year old daughter. We have seen the movies, so the only book in this series that captured our attention was the magician's nephew. My sister said that she read it to her kids who range in age from 15-2 years, and they loved it. (shrug) Maybe it is just because we started The Chronicles of Narnia just after we finished the FableHaven series, which was awesome!"
4,Please note that this is ONE large book,"Please note that this is ONE large hardcover book containing the 7 Narnia novels, not a box set (as shown in the ""search inside this book."") It is a beautiful shelf book, but at almost 5 pounds not something you will be carrying around to read.That said, The Chronicles of Narnia are wonderful stories, enchanting for children and enjoyable, thought-provoking stories for adults. The C. S. Lewis fantasies remain as some of my favorite stories ever. Enjoy!"
4,"Splendid Books, but BAD order","I've been reading the Chronicles of Narnia for a long time. They are written perfectly by the Author C.S.Lewis, and they show allegorical signifigence! The only reason that I have only rated this set with four stars, is because of the order! The Harper Collins Publishers have meddled with the chronicles, and taken the books out of the original written order, without C.S.Lewis' permission. Lewis is sadly deceased, so therefore, the publisher has NO right in changing the order! The story of Narnia is great, but the order this set is in is WRONG! I suggest all those who read these books to read them in the original published order, not the new meddled order! Otherwise, The chronicles are a great series to read!"
3,Paper qualtiy poor,"The box set is great reading...but for the price...especially the list price of $70.00, I would have expected higher quality paper. The set is printed on pulp paper and will not last worth beans and the covers are thin and not robust. You may as well buy the cheapest set you can find, because the quality of the cheaper books is not any lower, the books are just a little smaller and the ""bonus content is just the first chapter of the next book and some other tidbits of marginal interestHad I known about the paper quality being junk, I would have bought the individual books from Barnes and Noble with the slick, paper. It would have been about $25.00 more total, but I like to buy books that will still be readable in 20 years and not have pages crumble in your hands."
4,Very entertaining,Listening to the book in full theater format was very interesting and enjoyable.The only downside is that the presentation is an abridgement of the actual book and thus some information is lost.
5,Fantastic !!!,These books are a great read for kids and adults. C.S. Lewis has an excellent way of story telling that is simple and imaginative. I recommend these books for all age groups. Pick them up and enjoy.
1,What could they have been thinking?,"Really the only way to read these books is in their proper order:1 - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2 - Prince Caspian3 - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4 - The Silver Chair5 - The Horse and His Boy6 - The Magician's Nephew7 - The Last BattleThis is the way they were meant to be read! I have no ideawho decided putting them in chronological order was a good ideabut they were wrong, wrong, wrong. You can't find them anywherenow in the proper order which is a shame. I can't imagine gettingswept up into the world of Narnia by starting with the Magician's Nephew. What a sad development."
5,Excellent stories; book feels great in your hands,"We began reading this book on a road trip across Tennessee. The stories are excellent but if how a book feels in your hands - in terms of ink color, paper quality, ease of keeping it opened to the page you're reading -- this edition is outstanding."
3,Spcy histoiré with a lemon twist,this book literally enthralled me. The maticlous binding the thin yet stong pages of exellant opacity are donned with the most sensual of all typefaces. the cover illustrations really put you into the action like a quarterback helmet cam in a monday night footbalol game. the onlything i didn't like was the ending (left too many unresolved questions regarding the sexuality of daffy duck for my taste [and NO im not gay!!!]).this one will make you leave milk and sugar for spicy coffèè me friends o'yol!
2,"racist, bigoted, prejudiced","I first read these books in childhood. and loved them.A few years ago i tried to buy them in the (relatively) liberal city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I couldn't find a single Narnia book anywhere, and there were some pretty good bookstores to shop in.Back in the UK, i bought the boxed set and reread them., and realised why they were unavailable in a Moslem country.This book is really a crusade under another guise, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy being the holy warriors.The Calormen are the Moslems, and what an insulting portrayal is made of them.Having lived in the Middle East, and seen firthand the dignity and decency of devout Moslems, i wouldn't be surprised to learn that these books are actually banned there, and for good reason.I wouldn't want my child to read these dismal, dated, bigoted and racist writings."
1,Amazon does not ship as promised,"I do not have this item, but bought an in stock item from them on 12/5/05......still have not received and have not been contacted by the company. I would just hate to have more disappointed people during the holidays....let us take the fall and DO NOT believe Amazon shipment information."
4,The Magicians Nephew,The story is about a girl named Polly and a boy named Digory. The adventure off to this fantasy land by rings made by Digorys uncle Andrew. They meet a witch named Jadis at the palace of Charn and take her to London. The problem is that Digorys mother is very ill. I can't the solution or I would ruin the book.
5,wonderful fantasy collection that brings a sense of hope and,"The Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful fantasy collection that bring a sense of hope and self-worth to children. The onle thing that I do not apporve of is the reshuffle of them that The Magician's Nephew is considered to be book 1. Absolutely not, the whole introduction to the characters starts with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The magic starts there. I believe the books should follow their original format and be chronicled by publishing date. Putting them in order by story lessens the magic."
5,The Chronicles of Narnia are the best books ever!,"What can I say? They are wonderful!I loved them. Even though I'm Mexican I understood them very well, and they are the best books I've ever read in my whole life. They are so magical and fantastic... Who wouldn`t wish to get to a place like Narnia! I also think they talk about the Catholic faith in a magical way!"
5,Wonderful!,"If you've not read 'em, read 'em. If you have read 'em, read 'em again. Probably the best children's books out there, and that's saying a lot. ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are exciting, entertaining, great fun, and have enough suspense to be engaging the whole way through. Don't worry too badly about the book order; Either way, it'll make sense when you're done. My father read these to me when I was little, and I plan to do the same for my kids someday.""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are classics for a very good reason."
5,You want to read them again and again,"I didn't expect to like these books; I don't care for fantasy. But these were more than that. I read them to my children years ago, and by the third book, I was hooked, too. We each have different favorites in the series.C.S. Lewis does an excellent job in turning Biblical truths into epic, mythical stories. A danger of these books is that the stories are so engaging, you might read them instead of the Bible. I'm sure that wasn't Lewis' intention; rather it was to turn children onto Christianity with his understanding of it.I would definitely recommend this collection for families. The collection is one of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."
5,"Timeless Set, Great Presentation","This set is a great gift whether you were a kid 40 years ago or you're a kid now. For years this set of books has taken millions of readers an adventure after adventure. If you enjoyed them as a child or even as an adult, get this set and share the adventure with your loved ones."
5,First time reading through,"Yes, this is my first time reading through the chronicles of Narnia. This book was very exciting. Every page after page, I felt if I was really there from the first to the last page of the book. This is one of the most exciting books that I have ever read. I would encourge all of the adults plus children to read because you don't have to be young to enjoy this book you can be old as a parent or a grand parent and still feel excited about reading a novel like this.It comes to my attention that this book is not in the order that the author has wrote it in but I have to say it makes an excitable story to read. This would make perfect birthday/christmas presnt for anyone who loves to read."
4,Just what I ordered,I was looking for a set of the Chronicles of Narnia for my 10 year old grandson. This was what I wanted. thank you
5,Narnia,"I do not remember reading these stories to my children but I hope that I did. The set is excellent, high quality and compact. At 60 years old they are great stories and I hope to read them to my grandchildren or atleast pass it on to them."
5,Three thumbs up!,"Other reviewers have adequately praised this fine production, so I'll not guild the lilly. I would caution you, however, about buying this set as it could easily bankrupt you... not from the more than reasonable purchase price, but from the arm's length list of family and friends you'll want to bless with a copy of their own!"
5,"Thanks Amazon, Narnia is wonderful for the imagination.","This is my third child reading these books and the other two loved them, as I'm sure this one will."
5,Fantasy at it's finest,"I loved the fact that the narrative voice had me from the start. It took me a while to get through it, but the trip was well worth it! The character's voices were distinct and the plot couldn't have been more imaginative. A must read!"
5,Exceptional Quality-New,Thanks for the perfect condition like-new book set and quick delivery. It's so refreshing to know that I always get books in the exact condition advertised. Great quality control!
4,NARNIA!!!,"i loved these books when i was younger and i still do. i bought the set for my younger sister, the only negative is that it was missing book 3 and that the seller didnt include that information in the description. other than that the bookes where in great shape and i got a great deal on this package!"
4,"garish covers, great stories","Having discovered the Chronicles of Narnia maybe 40 years ago, I belive that they are an essential component of every library. This was my most recent contribution to this young family's collection."
3,Republish the books in the correct order,"This is C.S. Lewis' best work. I would buy the hardcover set, but the books are ordered incorrectly."
5,A 20th Century Classic,"These books are classics of the 20th Century, and those who haven't had the pleasure of reading through them should take a chance. This particular box set is beautifully laid out with great artwork and packaging. Well worth the time and effort!"
4,Classic with little flaw,There is no arguement about this classic series but the presentation and packaging of this product could be bit better - it feels bit cheap compared to the master quality of its contents...
5,Great Fantasy Book,The actual book was well constructed and journeyed with me all over California and Mexico. Being paperback it was a lot easier to read while travelling.The writing is similar to The Hobbit. A great fantasy adventure that is worth reading several times. This is a must read if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit. C.S. Lewis really nailed the environments of these books (the names of the talking animals are also great). I really enjoyed reading this series (in order) and look forward to reading them to my son when he comes of age.
3,I've read too much hardcore fantasy...,"Some people might think that my opinion here is biased, but I'm going to write it anyway. I'm a hardcore fantasy reader and so naturally I HAD to read the CoN. I found that it wasn't as amazing as I would have liked. First of all if you are used to long quests and epic battles, the CoN really throw you off. Quests sometimes happen in merely a page or two and the battles are mild to moderate. The characters usually have mildly interesting backgrounds, and most of the places that could have brought a lot of depth to the story are cut short. I don't want to ramble too much but the general idea is that the CoN are not for readers who really love series like the Lord of the Rings, DragonLance, or The Death Gate cycle. If you are into short, cute fantasy adventures, then the CoN are great for you."
1,I cannot title it,I would love to review this product but sadly it never made it to its destination. I have read The Chronicle of Narnia and I am a big fan of this series and all that C.S. Lewis writes. I sent this to someone as a Christmas present. I ordered it in mid November and it was never received.
5,Excellent Book,"I read it as a child and now my children are enjoying it!I'm the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle"
1,This is not Christian,"The best book of the series is the ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"".Some of the more worrying aspects of this series are the depictions of all White Europeans as basically good upright people in tune with nature and animals. Dark skinned people worship a false-gods filthy, evil and destroying nature etc.Don't believe me read ""Horse and his Boy"" and the ""Last Battle"" and see how any non white people are depicted, this is a disgrace. ...I'm not sure if the ""rights sort"" of Christian message is being projected...."
5,the order makes sense,In book 2 The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe the professor is really Digory in book 1 The Magician's Nephew.
4,"Fun, full of Wonder, Hope, and Love!","This is an amazingly fun and hopeful set of books! I still love them even at my age - don't ask I'm not telling but my well worn and much loved childhood box set still sets in my library! ;)My one star ding is for the publisher and the book order. If this is your or your child's first exposure to these books I recommend they be read in published order not chronological order, at least where the two books ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" (published 1st) and ""The Magician's Nephew"" (published 6th) are concerned. The reason is simple, secrets that are revealed in ""The Magician's Nephew"" lose their coolness factor if you discover them before you read the story of ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"". There is a big difference between the joy (and fun) of discovering new details about old friends (those you thought were so familiar) and learning about people and things you have never met and don't care about."
4,Slight Disappointment,"Even though I was told ahead of time that the books did not have a box I was still disappointed that they didn't.However, the books were in excellent shape and that's what matters most!"
4,"Great reading condition, quick delivery, prompt and courteous customer service.","I've always loved this series! The Chronicles were my first fantasy series, so imaginative and well written. It certainly nourished my right mind, and helped foster my love for reading. As an added bonus, your religious loved ones will approve it for their kids! Great purchase experience!"
5,Loooved it!,"This was a gift to myself and i love it, its a great book. Brings a map of narnia and some extra content to undersatand more themasterpiefe this is! Loved it!"
5,Nice,My 2 college grads kids want my copy for their own. The illustrations makes it special. It's a large book.
3,This was a different book from other books we read.,"We are the six grade Hot Dogz book group from Woodwoord-Granger. We thought this book was a more different book than we have ever read.It was a adventure fantasy.""When we read it, we could smell and see the things happening.We could even smell the trees."""
3,A bit cheap,I would recommend buying something bound better. These are just dinky little books. I would buy a different version if I purchased the series again.
5,All Great Books,"I have read the whole set, and have also skimmed through a guide I found at my local library. The guide kinda surprised me when it told me what the chronicles symbolize. Which is the christian religion. I only wish I could buy that guide."
4,"beautiful, but yeah - the order's wrong!","I love this collector's edition box set for the quality paper, the charming, but homey, and now colored! original illustrations, and of course, the well-remembered stories. But I am disturbed by the numbering of the books in Narnia-chronological order instead of publication order - or whatever the order was that I knew as a kid. How can ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" not be first?! The mind boggles. It is on such small landmarks that we steer our little ships of faith, and ... I regret this shakeup. I'll never know whether it makes any difference to the first-time Narnia reader, but I feel like it must - the author's increasing sophistication and changing priorities must come through. Argh! I hate this theft of history!"
4,Chronicles of Narnia set,"Love the stories, but didn't read the product description closely enough. The books are bound together into one large book, so awkward to carry around. I would prefer separate books. It's also in the ""new"" order. C.S. Lewis had ""The Lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" as the first book (when the children first enter Narnia). When his nephew took over, the nephew changed the order and put the ""Magician's nephew"" as the first book (when the animals first receive the gift of speech) along with a couple of other changes. I prefer the original order."
4,Nice Book Collection,"I bought this for my son who wanted the complete Chronicles of Narnia set. He was expecting the individual books but was pleased to have a hard copy addition with all of the titles in one book.The illustrations are the same as from the original printing and are in color.The map of Narnia on the cover is nice, not very detailed or large but I don't think Lewis gave much more detail of Narnia in his books."
3,Set is missing The Last Battle?,"I have not bought this set, but in looking at the picture of the set, there are only 6 titles present and none of them is The Last Battle. Also, I greatly prefer the originally published sequence. I am continuing to shop for a set hoping to find one in that sequence."
3,Incomplete Set?,"The box set came wrapped in cellophane, however, it only consisted of Books 2 through 7. Where is Book 1? I can't tell on the website what the titles of each book in the boxset are so I don't know which one I am missing other than Book 1. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the books. And I'm happy to have this in my collection."
3,Narnia,"I generaly enjoy this sort of a read, I tend to filter out the unpleasant articles of life this way,Lewis is repititious and the time line is tricky, but I am glad to have read it in its entirity."
4,GOOD BOOK,WE HAVE READ THIS BOOK BEFORE AND KNOW IT TO BE A GOOD BOOK. IT WAS SENT TO OUR SON AND HE REALLY ENJOYED IT.
3,"For Kids, Not Adults",Yes I'm 14 and read the first 4 books last year. I guess it was ok but it is really for like 10 year olds. Its old so newer kids might not like these books. To many good endings! Not any bad! Well Just to tell you that.
4,Three stars for adults. . .Five stars for kids,I thought they were well-written and most should enjoy them. I do think kids will like them more.
3,"Not exactly what I had in mind, but good nonetheless","My husband and I have been enjoying this item (the unabridged version) however I had been hoping to find a storytelling version with more true-to-the-book narration so that when the kids are older they can read-along. Sometimes the actors' take on the dialogue does not convey the purpose or feeling that Lewis indicated in the text, and a few times, little insights and delightful asides are lost on the listener. I found a new version, unabridged, narrated by Kenneth Branagh, will be release by HarperCollins on October, so we'll be getting that one in addition."
5,Classic children's literature,"The Narnia chronicles are possibly the best examples of children's literature: imaginative storytelling, obvious distinction between good and bad, and, most important, gripping and moving enough for adults too. Regardless of your age, you should have a set on your bookshelf.A note: suggestions by other reviewers that these books are 'based on the Bible' or 'teach... the grace and power of... Jesus' are false and should neither discourage nor encourage potential readers. C S Lewis was of course a devout Christian and the Narnia books have obvious religious symbolism, but the connection ends there. There are no specific references to Christianity, and any morally decent belief system, including secular humanism, could recognize itself in the actions of the characters. The same could be said of the Harry Potter books, where decency and courage again win the day."
5,The perfect gift,Bought this for my Son's birthday gift....he was delighted...this is a collection for everyone of all ages...not just children! All 7 books in the series plus additional material by the author...all in one hard cover book....who could ask for more???? Also the price was unbelievably low for this quality.
2,Christian readers for children.,"These are book with very strong Christian background.Although they are nicely written I'm not sure I'd recommendthem to friends with different opinion about religion;instead, I'd rather go for Grimm's tales, or Tolkien's ringseries if you prefer the same genre."
1,modern marketing mistakes!,"Why do modern marketers and editors believe they know better than the author as pertaining to the order this series should be read? Forget these modern sets and go look for an older original set that hasn't messed with the author's order of titles. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first book! 1/2 the fun of reading these for the first time is figuring out that the timeline is fluid and goes back and forth, both in Narnia and in our world. I adore this series and was going to buy a new set for my young son, but have found an old used set instead because i could not find a modern one that was reodered and messed with."
2,Uneven...,"I never read these stories in my youth and maybe that's why I wasn't too impressed with them. Yeah, they are ""classics"" I guess, but I still found them very uneven. I liked The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader best. They were very entertaining and no so preachy as the others. I thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe to be a very empty story. It just ended. Bang. The Silver Chair was not too bad, but uneven. I didn't care for The Last Battle or The Magician's Nephew at all. WAY too religious for me. I can't say I recommend these books."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These stories were wonderful! This was the first time I have read them, and they were the best stories I have read! I STRONGLY recommend reading them in the order they were written by CS Lewis - not in the order they are in the book. I think you would lose alot of the magic reading them in the order in the book. Either way - read them!"
4,Perfect Except for the Order,"Lewis is truly in his realm in the fantasy world of Narnia. You'll be amazed at how the wonder you experienced as a child will carry over into adulthood, as some of the more complicated symbolism becomes clearer and more powerful. Some may question the ordering of the stories in chronological order, but if this is not to your liking (and it is not to mine), then just be sure to check the dates and read them in the order published, starting with ""The Lion, the With and the Wardrobe"". And in addition to the great story, the illustrations are especially powerful and will further enjoyment of the youngest readers in your family."
5,Basic Library Necessity,"Absolute superb simplicity. Lewis has captured the essence of writing for all ages - the layers of understanding deepen with age and life experience. ""The Chronicles"" are definitely not allegory. To try and carry a meaning to its logical conclusion would result in a very distorted interpretation. However, viewed as a series of 'snapshots', it is possible to glean a myriad of illuminating and helpful 'pictures' that upon rereading or wrestling with a difficult idea causes you to cry 'Yes!! I see it now!!'. It is, in essence, a companion in life; one gains understanding from it as well as life giving understanding to it. Absolutely essential reading from childhood up."
4,"A wonderful set of kids book, but not in this order!","I read the Chronicles of Narnia about 13 years ago in the original sequence they were published, and found it perfect. I don't understand the current trend of placing the books in chronological order. C.S Lewis wrote the Magician's Nephew as the 6th book showing us a flashback into how Narnia was created and that's where it belongs, not as the first book. I have heard the rumor that C.S Lewis did want them in the current order, but only after extensive revision. Since he never got to them, the books definitely belong in the original order. To the Publishers, at least have two editions of the box set for those who believe the order you have chosen is pure sacrilege on an amazing set of stories!!!"
4,"nice book, thin pages","This book is very pretty on the outside but the pages are so thin you can see through to the next page, very nice to have the whole collection together though."
4,Read them in...,"...the originally published order as recommended by so many other reviewers. It's been said many times before but I can't stress it enough... Once again, the correct order is:(01) Lion, Witch & The Wardrobe(02) Prince Caspian(03) Voyage Of The Dawn Treader(04) The Silver Chair(05) The Horse and His Boy(06) The Magician's Nephew(07) The Last BattleYou won't regret it!"
4,An amazing childrens book,"CS Lewis has woven a masterpeice with this series. Re-reading this series has brung back memories of when i was in forth grade and addicted to these books, which take place during WWII. A must read."
4,Interesting/ Easy/ Short/ Great Story lines!,"I really recomend this series to EVERY ONE!!!!! And the first one you read should definatly be ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" after you read that first then you can read it in any order you want just as long as ""The last Battle"" goe's last."
3,"Great books, BAD ORDER!","This really ticks me off. The Chronicles of Narnia are one of the best series ever written, and these people just have to come and jack up the order. Both of my parents have boxed sets of them in the correct order, which is, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Nephew, and finally, The Last Battle. Whoever the heck put The Magician's Nephew first is dead wrong! C.S. Lewis meant for them to be in the correct order I have listed above. It ruins all the mystery and the surprise by having The Magician's Nephew first. I loved reading The Magician's Nephew after the first five, because it explained everything after they had already been introduced. Don't by this set. Go to a book shop that has them in the correct order, not the incorrect order."
5,Excellent small library,This is a very elegant library for reading enjoyment...books are very well made and as a set to me are invaluable...most excellent !!
4,The Chronicles of Narnia,My grandchildren are now 7 and 3. They love for their Grannie to read to them when visits occur. My daughter said she loved for them to have this book in their collection. Grannie Sue loves them to cuddle up so she can read to them. It's almost the only time they're quiet on a visit!Harry B.
2,Complete Chronicles of Narnia,I was very disappointed with the condition of this book. The dustcover jacket was damaged and there was a large ink smudge on one of the pages. It was shrinkwrapped to the point that the dust cover was bent all the way around.
5,Very pleased!,"One of the books in the set was missing upon receipt, so I emailed the sender and immediately the missing book was sent to me. I was so pleased with the way it was handled and the speed with which matters were made right. Thank you all. Marion Wilke"
4,One of the classics of kids' lit,"This is a great bit of literature, whether it's an allegory or not. Milton's Paradise Lost refers back; it's a classic.This book is rich in metaphor and symbolism. The storyline is fantastic in nature; kids who find a whole other world. All seven books amount to a full size book today, really. It's not that much different in size from Harry Potter.This is a great story, well told, with characters that you truly are interested in and care about.You won't feel like it's too Christian (I'm NOT one) and you won't feel like it's too secular. It's just a story that flows and swells and is fun to read."
5,"beautiful book, wrong order","The Chronicles of Narnia has long been a staple of literature that people truly enjoy to read. These are wonderfully written stories together in a beautiful book for your coffee table. The pictures amongst the stories are enchanting. The only thing I have against this book is that ""Magician's Nephew"" is first, when it should start with ""The Lion the Whitch and the Wardrobe"". If I had read the ""Magician's Nephew"" first, I might never have loved the series quite as much. Not to say it is bad, but it is more of history of a place you have already been than an introduction to the world. Everyone should read this series."
5,I HAVE LOVED THESE BOOKS FOR A LONG TIME,I understand people's objections to this edition of the Chronicles of Narnia and in a way I concur with them.I have read these book over 30 times over the last 40 years and of course I know the correct order.The reason I got this edition is so that I can have them in an easily transportable form to carry with me.There is nothing better than the boxed set with them in order but for convenience sake this one is okay
3,CHRONICLES IN ORDER,"The Chronicles of Narnia are truly a classic set of books detailing a world that has captivated audiences of all ages for decades. Unfortunately, the new publishers of this series have decided to reorder the books from the original (and intended) order. Though the books weave a wonderful tapestry when read in any order, if you are interested in reading them in the order they were meant to be read, here it is: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Nephew, The Last Battle. Cheers to C.S. Lewis for giving us such a fantastic series, and shame on the publishers for imposing their own reading on a classic series. Would they have reordered the halves of Shakespeare's Henry IV if the author hadn't put the parts in the title?"
5,I read these books every summer.... they're awesome.,"I am a freshman in college, and I have been reading these books since I was little... they never get old. I am constantly finding new meanings and insights into the work, it is absolutely amazing. Highly reccomended for anyone, especially with an understanding of the bible."
5,It is my favorite book of all time,"The Chronicles of Narnia is a touching story, of magic and fantsy. For all people who love to read about faraway places and magical lands, this is a book for you. A story about children and their adventures with Queen Judis,the White Witch, Prince Caspain,Trumpkin the duarf and Aslan the great lion himself. Go with these children and explore with them. It will touch your heart,and you will be running to your bookshelf again and again to read these wonderful stories. It will Always have a place in my heart, how about in yours???"
5,Some of my favorite readings from college,I first read the Chronicles of Narnia as a student in college(not as an assignment). The wonder and simplicity of the children's story easily drew me into Narnia. It's amazing that Lewis could express truths so clearly that they are both obvious to children and profound to adults. I have re-read them since college and hope to do so again soon. I would highly encourage any parent or teacher to read the stories with their children. It's the best of children's literature (which makes it great reading for adults as well).
4,Great adventure stories,"I like this stories very much. Narnia is beutiful world and it is just great to follow the adventures through the stories. Also the size of the books are not to large and not to small, they are perfect to read in bed before you go to sleep."
5,books for christians,C.S. Lewis did not believe in God as a result of the losses of people he loved. After changing from a nonbeliever to a Christian he wrote books which exemplified his faith. I see the Narnia chronicles as a good representation of his faith. I highly recommend this item to those who are looking for additonal evidence to support their faith in a higher power.
5,Excellent Reading,"Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful set of stories about what Christ can do for us in times of great turmoil and troubles. I recommend this to all parents as a great way to share with their children, young and old."
5,New order is the intended order,"I don't think that anyone needs another person to commment about how wonderful this series is, but I would like to note that the reordered box set is in the order that C. S. Lewis intended. Although he didn't publish them in this order, it really is a much more sensible way to read the series. I was a little upset when I learned they reordered the series, but since it's according to C. S. Lewis' wishes, it's all the better. Plus, being in the middle of reading the series in chronological order makes the story much more linear (of course) although the elucidation experienced from reading the old non-chronological order has been a bit lost. Those who have already read the series, please read them again in the order that C. S. Lewis wanted. It's really a great series either way - perhaps better now that it's in the order that C. S. Lewis originally wanted."
4,nargrina,it was a good series and a great way to let your imagintion run wild. that's why i liked this book or series
5,Hard finding the RIGHT order,"I have enjoyed these books since I was a kid and got them from the library. By the time I owned the books though, somebody decided the story is better read in chronological order rather than published order. I could hardly disagree more. I am very happy that I was able to find this older set illustrated by Pauline Baynes that rightly place The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as book 1 rather than The Magician's Nephew."
5,Awesome,I got this product early. It was in great condition. You could hear my kids squeal for blocks with they got this package.
5,Great for commuting,"I found a used copy and listened to it over weeks of commuting. My 8 year old son also listened to it (a few discs behind me). These are great classic fantasy stories that really span generations. This set was really well done with different voice actors who really brought the characters to life. Having the whole story in an unabridged version was wonderful. I haven't listened to too many audio books, but that is likely to change. I'll be looking for more great stories told in thier entirety by good actors like this."
5,Chronicles of Narnia,"The Chronicles are a beautiful classic to have in your bookcase. Not just for kids, and great to re-read."
5,"Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe",All I have read is this book and I thought that it was wonderful .We had to read it for school in 6th grade and my teacher suggested getting the series so I did. I ordered them off Amazon and was so happy!
5,THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA,"Magnificent! Prodigious! Entertaining! Masterful! Lovely! Beautiful!These are wonderful books. My teacher read THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, and then I read all of them! I urge you to read these prodigious works!"
4,Interesting and Strange Tales,These books are great for the brainy reader because some of the things could be very confusing!! These stories are written by a true author who writes from the heart!!
4,perfect gift...,this is the perfect gift to give a younger child who's in their 4th or 5th year of reading. C.S.Lewis is an amazing author! my brother loves this series.
5,Well made book. Perfect for story time with the kids.,"This book is very well made, very similar to a text book binding and it has become one of my family's favorites.It's a large book, with pictures, and my daughters really appreciate the maps on the front and back covers.The pages of the book have colored borders, and there are an artist's version (every 10 pages or so) that help describe the story; however, the art is not distracting, and helps to inspire the imagination of the reader.This is a great book to add to your library!"
5,Loved It!!,"This collection is one of the greatest books I have ever read. C.S. Lewis was a very talented writer. Doesn't matter how old you are, you will enjoy this book. I was very pleased with the seller and would definitely buy from them again."
4,Classics in the world of faerie tales,"O.K. The Chronicles of Narnia are children's books, but they don't have to be considered that way. If you are a Christian, you'll actually find Lewis rewrote the bible in a simple and more cheerful way, disguising Christ as Aslan and showing Israel as the land of Narnia, though this was not Lewis' original intention, nor does he mention this fact in the books. Even if you're an adult, its not hard to give way to the magic that surrounds these books. These simple stories are easy to follow, portray people we can all relate to, and are entertaining. Whether you are reading these book at the age of seven or reading these to your children at bed-time, you'll easily become hooked on the writings of one of the world's greatest modern Christian thinkers."
2,its kinda dumb!,"On a personal I thought that the entire story line was kind of stupid. I read the book and then I decided to rent the movie to watch it... And I feel like they followed the book in a creepy way, Kind of when you being followed by someone you have no idea who it is. Unless the book I read was made after the movie I thought the story line was supper ...strange because why does someone go into a world in the back of a wardrobe and keeps walking alone with no parent super vision and she meets people that are not even close to being human .... At least she got her siblings to finally come with her. Having a mom that is a safety freak I have learned that this kind of stuff really bugs me! I really don't recommended it at all unless you like fictional weird talking animals that go to war... then this is totally for you"
3,Chronicles of Narnia,Just what I expected: a childish fantasy. Ok if you like that sort of thing.Evelyn Horn
2,A GOOD SET IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND YOU WANT IT AS IT IS,"I returned my set as I felt it was very expensive for a small and inexpensive paper back set. This review covers more that than how good the written material was. Though I have not read them, my wife did as a kid and she believes they are excellent."
3,Narnia!,"The Narnia book is a very adventures book. My favorite part was the war against the White Witch. My favorite character is Edmund because he is my age. Most of the story takes place in the Narnia woods. I like how a very long time in Narnia doesn't take any time in the real world. The main characters are Peter, Edmund, Susan, Lucy, and Aslan. The book is fantasy because the children go to a magic world."
5,Good book,My daughter really enjoyed this book. It was great and very entertaining for her. I buy her books now that she can read on her own and I was happy to see that she read it all by herself. This book is a great fantasy book that all children can enjoy. It makes a great gift.
5,great value,This boxed set is a very nice compromise. It has a nice collection for less money. The paperback books come in a case which helps keep them nice.
3,Very Pleased,"I enjoyed this series. After reading the Harry Potter series and The Lord of the Rings series, I did a little more research into like-fiction. When I found Narnia, I bought it, and I haven't regretted the decision."
3,"Stick with Lion, Witch and Wardrobe","If you already know you're going to read the entire collection, this is the volume for you. If, on the other hand, you're simply looking for a good story, this is not the collection you want. ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is a fine story, whether you're expecting Christian allegory or not. Its characters are so much bigger than life that Narnia simply grows from them in our hearts. The other books in the Chronicles are pale by comparison: they lack character development, are filled with convenient plot twists and cliches. I was severely disappointed after hearing years of comparisons between C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Silmarilion"" leave the reader begging for more. By the time you've finished the ""Chronicles"", however, you'll be ready for them to end."
2,The Chronicles of Narnia,"Very Good. The moral teachings are very subtle, and produce a good moral teaching for young people. It is also quite good for adults."
3,Chronicles of Narnia Movie Tie-in Box Set The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"As expected it is the Chornicles of Narnia boxed set; however when they said it was repackaged to reflect the movies, that is all they did. A new box. The books and text are the same old text."
5,Incredibly Entertaining and a great value,"I love this set. The performers are superb, and are clearly having fun with the reading, the text is unabridged, and there is a complete lack of chessy effects or background sound track, with the exception of segway music at the beginning and end of each CD, which I personally find very a very nice prompt to switch CDs. Even the questionable nod to femminism by including Lynn Redgrave as a reader for ""Prince Caspian"" does not diminish the production or entertainment value one iota. They presented in a different order from the original book series publication, but that was no matter to me: I simply listen to them in the coreect sequence. I am perfectly content to hear how it all began later rather than sooner."
4,"Great stories, easy read",It is the classic novels. I liked having the series broken up into individual books (I have seen it before all bound together). They are easy reads and very enjoyable!
5,Great for bedtime reading...,Great reading for the kids bedtime and even after they are asleep you can continue reading it for yourself.
5,great set of books,"the collection is very nice, is petite and not so heavy, for a great set of books"
3,Excellent Books but Poor Quality,"That is no question about the books themselves is classic and excellent readings. But the quality of the paperback is poor. If you are building up your own library and want to have quality books, it is better going to B&N bookstore, at lease you can feel the pages before making a purchase. Needless to say, that is what I will be doing from now on."
5,Classic,"I read the entire Chronicles of Narnia. It is fun to discuss the books with my sister. I suggest everyone to take the time to read these great stories. I assure full enjoyment. The Boxed Set of ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is a perfect gift. It is the classic of spiritual writing. I think C. S. Lewis's great collection belongs on everyone's bookshelf. From contemporary author's collection I mostly recommend B. Nowiki's new seriesWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2"
2,Not what I thought,"I didn't realize that I was getting one large book of all the books, not each book separately. The book was HUGE and even if I did want them all in one book, I'm sure I could find a smaller one."
2,Not what I expected,"The books came in a decent amount of time but when I opened the delivery box I was disappointed to find the books were not in a collectors box set as advertised. The books were not even from the same set so that the cover pictures aren't compatable. One book has someone's name written down the side, another is an old library book complete with dewey decimal system code on the binding and return slip in the inside cover. I love C.S. Lewis and all the Narnia books and others of his works and am glad to have my own copy of this collection, but I was expecting a better quality of books with a collector's box. Seller should have used a differet photo of the books and clarified that they weren't all the same edition and didn't come in an actual ""box set""."
5,WOW!!!!!!! THE BEST BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!,"These are THE BEST books I've read in my life! Cost alot, but worth your while! I was SO sad when I finished them! I still miss those can't put down books, my only complaint is: I wish the coronicles never ended! I want MORE!!! They are THE BEST!! -Pierce :)"
5,The kids love it and I love it,"The Chronicles of Narnia is a series much like Star Wars or LOTR, people appear to either love it or hate it. I'm one of those people who happen to love it! I first read the books when I was about ten years old and they have yet to grow old on me.I especially appreciate the strong parallels it shares with Christianity and Aslan's being a sort of 'what if' incarnation of Jesus in Narnia, as opposed to a mere allegory, as I, myself am a Christian.If you are not a Christian, however, you may want to steer clear of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader and The Last Battle, as these books have the strongest messages in them.This book arrived on time and the cover is very attractive, though it isn't suitable for travel usage. I am glad that the stories are done in chronological order in this book as well."
5,The Chronicles of Narnia,"C.S. Lewis creates a magical world of centaurs, witches, kings, queens, fauns, etc. so real you wish you could find your own secret passage to Narnia. Each book in this series stands alone as it's own story, but once you read one, you will want to read all of The Chronicles of Narnia. The characters come to life and their adventures, although fantastic, are likened to every day struggles of the real world. A beautiful religious message of eternal life offered through Christianity is woven into the stories, but is not overpowering or pushy. Christians will delight in the parallels and non-Christians will savor the books for their entertaining fiction."
3,"A great story, but...","The writing feels a little soft now that I have reread it ahead of the motion picture release. I was hoping for a much more magical reading experience a la Tolkien's efforts. In my opinion, I am actually more interested in seeing the director's adaptation now. Somehow, when I was younger (20 years ago), the books just seemed a lot more intense. Perhaps I have become jaded with my age.So, here's the takeaway: they are great stories, but I think they're better off reading to a child then actually deeply immersing oneself."
3,The Chronicles of Nadia,"I got the whole set in paperback. Ihad read this series many years ago and looked forward to reading them again. I was not disappointed. They were as good, if not better, that I ahd remembered. Well worth my time and energy."
4,Great books!,"I started reading the series in 7th grade.The 1st book took me 2 days.These are short books,but their filled with wonderful stories and a great plot.The entire series should take you about 3 weeks.Great series!"
4,Read the books first -- then enjoy the audio tapes.,"Although these tapes are an abridged version of C.S. Lewis's masterwork, they are well worth purchasing, especially for children. My father read the Chronicles to me when I was a boy, and then bought me the tapes. In addition to re-reading the books several times, I listened to one of the tapes almost every night before going to bed. The actor's performances are excellent -- any child would benefit from hearing the English language so well spoken. The abridgement was thoughtful, though much is left out. Use the tapes to add to the enjoyment of the Chronicles, but not as a substitute for the books."
3,For Kids,"These are children's books and read as such. If you discovered them late in life, as I did, you may be frustrated by the writing style and simplistic imagery. Do not expect them to have the cross-over appeal of Lord of the Rings, His Dark Materials, or even Harry Potter. I'm sure they're wonderful for children, but adults may not enjoy them as much."
5,Audio Narnia Superb,"Harper audio w/ English narrators (e.g., Michael York, Derek Jacobi & Lynn Redgrave) of each unabridged Narnia novel involve & enthrall the listener, young & old (my grandsons, wife & I are all captivated). Superb production of Lewis' deceptively simple & timeless tales. Nearly perfect!"
2,The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set,"I purchased this set for my grandsons. Being familiar with this author's work and having read the books long ago, I recommend them to anyone with children. Sandra Robertson"
2,This book ******* sucks!!!,"I don't believe why this book is so good. I read it and thought to myself what is so special about this book. Some spoiled british kids come and save the world and say ""Hullo"". Then there is the main man lion Aslan. He makes some talking animals that save the spoiled british kids every second. These kids are allways hungry, in 3rd grade, sleep 15 hurs a day and are retarded and have no phisical ability. These kids have never had any hardship. When they are in trouble they never escape, a 10 foot rat saves them. I don't belive this series. It is a pice of crap!"
1,Horrendous!,"I purchased these books on the pretence that they would be a great read. I was disappointed. After reading the first 4 books, I started to dread reading the rest of them.It's true, these books do have a Christian background but being a Christian myself, I must say I would NOT recommend them at all.As for tolerance (as another reviewer, Robert J. Ruhf says we must all practise)....why should anyone tolerate racism and murder?! These books are full of it!!! Unacceptable! Sadly, we do live in a violent world but it is NEVER right to teach our children that it is ok to kill people as long as it's for a so called `good' cause.Lewis's Aslan, who us earthlings know better as God is disgraceful! No true Heavenly being would call upon innocent children to wage war! What was this Author thinking!I wish I had borrowed these books instead off rushing off to buy them. Don't waste your money, try the library and I recommend the adults read it before giving it to their children."
1,I didn't freakin' get it!,"I didn't freakin' get it! yeah that's pretty much it, it never showed up. anyone out there wanna help with this one. huh, where is it guys?"
1,Commercialism to the Max,"I bought these books to have something nice to read to my grandkids. I had to stop, however, because the books are nothing more than advertisments for ""Turkish Delight,"" a candy popular in the U.K. The whole point of buying books for my grandkids was to give them a break from advertising, and here (throughout) are ads for this ""Turkish Delight""! How much money is this Mr. Lewis getting from the Cadbury's chocolate company anyway? This man must be laughing to the bank!"
4,Always a classic,"These books have always been to me a classic staple of the Fantasy Genre, they should be ranked with Tolkien as a must read for fantasy readers everywhere. Their links to the realworld make them perfect for younger readers to embrace the sword and sorcery type worlds And their parallels to christianity help establish fundamental morals of right and wrong to be applied into the real world. My only problem with this particular set is that they rearranged the order the books were to be read. The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe should always be the first read before opening the next 6. I was proud to share this series with my 10 year old daughter who absolutely loved The Lion... and I cannot wait for her to join Aslan, Prince Caspian, Puddleglum and the others of Narnia's fabled lands."
2,"Amazing series, but they left out the best book","Political correctness strikes again at Scholastic. Book 7 (The Last Battle) is the most obviously evangelical book, so Scholastic left it out.Otherwise, a reasonably well done version of one of the greatest fiction series ever written. I'd stick with the 1976 version or the recent one. They've got all the books, and the books themselves are better built."
5,Good company on a long trip alone.,I have never listened to a book on CD and I have to say I was delighted to have these on a very long trip I needed to drive. The trip was 7 hours and I found myself wanting to take another trip around the block to finish chapters. I have finished some of them on my stereo doing quilting. The readings were excelent.
4,A step in the fantasy,"As expected a great book, good edition and the best possible format (7 books in a set) much easier to read. For all ages with different levels of comprehension."
4,A Good Read,These were a childhood favorite! I was so excited to see them all together for a great price.
5,Superb.,"When I was 8, my mother read all of the Chronicles of Narnia books to me before bedtime. I loved them, read them over and over in elementary school, and promptly forgot about them for about 10 years. Recently, I got a the ""all in one edition"" as a gift, and fell back into Narnia's grasp. The books are not complicated, and may turn off some people because of that simplicity. But therein lies, in my view, the greatest strength of the story. I won't bother to rehash the plots, because it is likely that you already know them. The allegorical themes touch on the essence of who Jesus Christ is, and what it means to be a follower of Him. I know some will stop reading right now and declare this review crap because of the mention of God, but these books are more than worth your time."
3,Irritating marketing mars this edition,"I was looking for a high-quality edition of the Chronicles of Narnia for my daughter. I thought this new boxed set looked really attractive with the colored illustrations and quality paper. Why did the publisher have to ruin it with the big, stupid yellow circles screaming about a ""major motion picture"" on the box and on the cover of each book? Marketing people truly have no taste or aesthetic sense."
2,Poor implementation of a great series of books.,"This audio compilation does NOT contain the full text of any of the original stories. It is massively abridged, and has lost all of the character development. While the readers' performances are excellent, their talents are largely wasted, as the stories thus abridged are rather lifeless. I bought this set for my blind wife, who fondly remembers the original stories from her childhood. She is disappointed with the set, and I consider it to have been a waste of money.[Dale Dolan, Kelowna BC"
4,Good listening,"My two children, ages 6 and 10, truely enjoyed these books. My second graders really liked them too. They said they would have liked them a little better if the characters had the voices, like in the new The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I believe this series by C.S. Lewis is a timeless classic who can be listened to and enjoyed by people of all ages!!!"
5,Excellent series for children and adults alike,"As several others have already commented, reading the series by publication date is, in my opinion, the only way to do it. Unfortunately this package doesn't present them in this way, but that is easy to fix. Lion should definitely be read first, and Battle last.Buy this package! You won't be sorry you did."
5,Every library deserves these books!,"The Chronicles of Narnia are, without a doubt, the best books I have ever read. They have been good friends since the fourth grade, friends whom I return to repeatedly. Rich characters, wonderful fantasy and profound messages enable the books to grow with you. Every library deserves these treasures, and every child and adult should get to know Aslan and friends."
4,Book size,"Well I remembered how much I loved the Narnia series when I was a kid so when I saw all seven books in a box set I had to have them. There is one thing bothering me though, do these books seem shorter to anyone else? I was sure that the books had more pages to them when I first read them, or maybe it was because I was smaller back then! Anyway, I am glad to own the set, I can't wait to give them to my kids to read if I ever have any..."
5,order changed,"The executors of the Lewis literary estate are systematically removing all aspects of classical Greek and Roman literature from the works of Lewis. In the poetry they have rewritten them. In this set of books they have changed the order. Classical epics, like Virgil's Aeneid, always start in the middle of the story as originally did this set of books."
5,Great for Chapter Book reading,My Son who's in the 5th grade love's this collections. It has nice pictures to go onlong with the story. Letter sizing is a good size as well.
4,A great start into fantasy worlds,"These were the first books I ever read that were truly based in what could be termed a fantasy world. The books were so good I often finished each of the in a days time. It wasnt until years later that someone pointed out to me that there was major christian symbolism in these books. I know Lewis was primarily a religious author but I still cannot see the symbolism inside. I guess I will need to reread these again. I will gladly do it, for my children. They deserve to know such treasures stories."
5,These books made me believe in Jesus Christ,"C S Lewis is my guiding light in trying to become and stay a good Christian. Through his works he has made me see lots of things about God, that stay hidden for me when reading the Bible. Open your hearts and eyes and learn about the Lord of Love in a way you never thought possible!"
5,"If you love ANY of these stories, you'll love this!","The wonderful stories speak for themselves. This particular edition is beautiful to look at as well. A real treasure! I grew up having these books read to me at summer camp, and at home in my family. I've never outgrown the love I have for them!"
1,Not Happy,"When the set arrived in the mail it was missing ""The Magician's Nephew"" which was supposed to be included in the purchase."
4,Joyfully Sharing,"Have read it many times. My daughter is finally of age that she will sit and listen - paying attention to the details and trying to follow the story. So I am joyfully sharing these stories with her, now."
5,Grandson's deligt,Our son requested this boxed set of The Chronicles of Narnia for our grandson. Our grandson was delighted. Thanks to Amazon the gift set arrived in plenty of time for Christmas & in good condition. We can always count on Amazon.
3,Oops - Should have known is was in ONE volume,"Did not see the package ""open"" in the add - too quickly decided to get it - really wanted the volumes separate for a young reader. Beautiful book - but wish it had been stated as such."
5,Wonderful! A must read.,"I don't have kids yet, but I got this set for when I do. I want them to feel the sense of wonder and magic that I did the several times I read each book as a youth. I freely admit to trying to reach Narnia through my closet ""wardrobe"" as a boy. I never was able to physically, but mentally I was there with all the wonderful characters. Truly classics that sparked my imagination and ones that I enjoyed re-reading and gleaned new things from every time.REVIEW UPDATE:Well, I have kids now, and I stand by my earlier posting. When they are old enough, I definitely want them to read these books. :)UPDATE #2 (01/16/2012):Well, my son is 11 now and a perfect age to start reading this, but if it doesn't have a robot or lightsaber in it, then it's hard to get him to even look at it. I'll keep at him though. My daughter is 7 and a voracious reader, so I'm sure that in a year or two she'll be ready to read the whole series."
5,"Meat for the soul, Candy for the mind (tough on the eyes)","For people who know the story and beliefs of Christianity this book awakens ideas and refocuses our hearts on the truths that we so often forget. These books remind me that though this world seems very real, it's history reads like a fairy tale. The truth in reality, as well as in Narnia, is perhaps the hardest adventure in which to partake. I love Lewis. I give this set 35 stars, five for each book."
5,the best series ever written,"At 18 I can still not get enough of this series of books. Although they target young adults, they are a series that when studied offer incredible insights into the theory of time and space. These are quite simply the best books ever written. Lewis is an incredible author."
5,A good trip back,"I think of all the options available at Amazon, this is the most cost-effective. The only thing I recommend doing is to read the books in their original published sequence and not the chronological timeline. The reasons for reading this by chronology is simply thin--despite what the book description may say at the back of this volume. Besides, you lose the mystery of discovering Narnia through the Wardrobe. There is a strong aspect of milieu-discovery within these stories. To read them by chronological order removes the sense of exploration. Besides, the chronological ordering destroys the otherwise continuous narrative of the Pevensie children and--to a degree--destroys the 4th wall.In short: Buy this book 'cuz it's cheaper :) Go to the copyrights page and read the stories according to their publish date for the authentic and more complete experience."
4,Solid and Eye Appealing,"This stand really sets off the Toshiba television. It fits perfectly around the TV and is fairly solid. I have moved the TV on the stand a few times to get behind the TV to hook up equipment. Of course the TV is only 105 pounds. There are two shelves for equipment which is ample space for me. I have a 100 disk CD player, stereo receiver, DVD player, PS2 and DirecTV HD-DVR on the shelves. There are no storage cabinets on this stand."
4,perfect gift for a four-year-old,"I gave this CD to my four-year-old granddaughter for her birthday and she just loves it. She plays it every night before she goes to sleep. I like it too because many of the songs are familiar to me as well, so we can sing them together."
3,Songs for daughter,"I found the CD ok, a lot of the songs that the kids love was not listed on the CD."
4,Disney Princess: The Ultimate Song Collection,"I bought this for my daughter. She was thrilled to have it. I was pleased to hear her singing it from her bedroom and I didn't have to worry about language, sexual content or violence. These days you have to really LOOK for content your children can SAFELY listen to, this would be a GREAT safe choice for your children."
4,Memorizing the lyrics,"My daughter insists that we play this CD every time we get into the car, to the point where I am learning all the lyrics to the songs! It's a little trip down memory lane for me as well, and I even hear her singing along, which is so lovely. As long as you have other CDs to rotate it with, it's a nice selection for a girl who loves princesses (and which of them doesn't?)."
3,Good but is not worth collecting...,"There are many Disney Princess songs from films in this album, and they are familiar to Disney Princess fans, except ""If you can dream"". I think this album is not as good as ""Disney Princess Tea Party"", so I don't like it very much."
3,not very clear,"My 2 year old loves this CD, however, the quality of it isn't the greatest. The songs obviously came directly from the movie, so the sound is a bit muffled at times and not very clear."
3,Just OK,Got this for my daughter for her new CD player. She really doesn't listen to it much and it's a little annoying on my end. She prefers the Alvin & the Chipmunks CD wich is actually pretty good. My daughter is 7 so maybe she is starting to get too old for princess stuff. Might be an OK CD for a younger girl. I will not buy a disney princess CD again for someone her age.
3,good soft disney music,"Good album, a bit on the slow song side, but my girls like it. I think I was hoping for more peppy songs instead of ballads, so if that's what you are looking for, buy it."
3,Nice.,"We got this for our 3 year old for Christmas. It is a nice cd, but she didn't really know all the songs. We thought it was more like the soundtracks from the movies. She still enjoys it though."
5,Disney CD- Princess,What can you say. This CD delivers exactly what it states. A nice collection of the Disney Princess favorites.
4,A great gift,Sent to my friend's daughter for X-Mas (she is almost 5).she loved it and it didn't drive my friend too crazy.
4,i think it works!,"I've been doing a lot of combination remedies to grow my hair, so I cant say for SURE that it works, but somethings working thats for sure! There's cayenne pepper in this so BE AWARE! it will give you heartburn unless you have a stomach of steel (this is the ONLY thing that's ever caused heartburn for me). Label recommends 4 capsules; i'd say you're good with two. (i could only imagine how much 4 would burn going down....). but it should be noted that your stomach will settle almost instantly if you take it after eating and drink a cup of water as soon as you start to feel the sizzle. overall, i guess its not too bad!"
2,2.5 stars- Lenny drawing attention to himself,"I can't believe that these other reviewers think that the last movement being played at about 18:00 is valid. To show complete despair, does it have to really be played at a crawling pace like that? Karajan's late 70's DG version is full of despair but is played at a fairly quick 9:50. Bernstein, especially in his last years, was very self-indulgent, and it really shows in this reading. Lenny isn't serving Tchaikovsky but himself. Tchaikovsky, I'm sure, would hate this beautiful symphony given this kind of treatment. The longest last movement that I've ever seen before this clocked in at about 11:30, so he's about 6:30 past that, which is totally freaking crazy!!! This is interesting to hear maybe once just to hear how bad this freakish intrepretation is, but most people wouldn't be satisfied with this kind of stuff. Buy the Karajan DG version from the late 70's and just forget about this self-indulgent reading."
1,little or no help,The Guide would be useful to an interior decorator. I was looking for help in estimating cost and materials needed to build a porch.
3,Authentically preserved,"3 1/2Under-sung blues-rock band's bold but brief early 70's life offered humble additions to the format, exceeding generic southerenly ruckus when sharply raw riffs mixed with progressive inclinations."
4,Mozart's Requiem,"I purchased this CD at the recommendation of my choir director, as we are performing it in March 2009 and it is sung most similarly to how she will conduct it. As she had mentioned, there are some odd pronunciations which I would have noticed even had she not said. There are a few overly dramatic holds at the end of some of the pieces but overall it is well done and what I needed as I am rehearsing it mostly on my own (due to missing rehearsals from business travel). I will probably try another recording of this beautiful work at some point."
5,Good old-fashioned fun for the family,We play this every time the family gets together. Great interaction and fun for all--grandkids through grandma. A refreshing change of pace from watching TV or playing video games.
5,Great fun for all!!!,"The most fun I've had in awhile. For an extra twist, play so that you have to get 10,000 points exactly."
3,Eww.,"Tastes terrible by itself. Might be okay if mixed with lots of other things. Unless you absolutely need rice protein or think it has some kind of optimal nutritional profile, I'd look at other protein sources."
2,Horrible. Gross. Disgusting,"In an effort to begin a vegan lifestyle, I bought this powder to up my protein. At first I drank it straight up. It was awful. Then I tried to add it to shakes. It literally ruined the taste of the shake. I even added sugar and yogurt to the shake to hide the taste...nope still could taste it. I'll use this up, but will never buy it again."
2,Good for baking and baking only!,"Let me begin by saying that this stuff tastes TERRIBLE. It's gross, really. It has a very strong, over-powering taste and texture which makes it hard to use in anything other than baking. It's good mixed into oatmeal or used as flour for pancakes, but it requires a lot of other ingredients/toppings to cover up the taste. I love that it's vegan, has great stats and is all natural, but I really don't like the taste. For me, the taste is pretty important. I won't buy it again.Has anyone tried the chocolate flavor? I'm curious to see if it's any better than the vanilla. After all, it has sweetener and the vanilla has none at all, not even stevia. Blech."
2,Stick to what works -- this stuff is not good,"Taste: 99% nasty, 1% vanilla. The only time it was even mediocre was when it was mixed with a Fruit Punch flavored Creatine powder.Mixability: This stuff does NOT mix well in most cases. Drink it fast or it will sink to the bottom of whatever it's mixed in -- even when blended.Texture: Grainy, sand-like consistency.Smell: Old, over-cooked rice.Plus sides: Serving size is small (1 Tbsp.), net protein:cost ratio is decent, no animal byproducts.Moving forward: If you want a vegan/vegetarian protein option, or if you're just looking to reduce the amount of whey/casein in your diet -- which for those of you who live by it, there are some serious health consequences associated with excessive diary-based protein diets -- look elsewhere first. Personally, I'm finishing this container, and looking for another alternative."
5,Just what i needed,"I purchased this because i just found out that I have an egg and yeast allergy. Not too sure what my eating choices are yet , I wanted to have something on hand for a quick breakfast or snack,so I didn't have to spend a lot of time looking at food labels or cooking something, but yet get an adequate amount of protein and nutrients. This protein powder has no yeast and is labelled vegan, so I don't have to worry about the ingredients.So anyway, this stuff is delicious! I have been making smoothies with the powder, some milk, banana and berries. I have used frozen fruit and it can be a little gritty, but I find that if you mix the powder with the milk first ( I use a hand-held blender) it is much less gritty, and if you use non frozen fruits it is pretty darn grit free. The taste is good also,just a mild creamy vanilla.I would recommend this powder!"
3,Its...Ok.,"Good amount for your money, BUT: this product is very grainy, and isnt as thick and creamy as I would like it. The vanilla flavor is also just ""ok."" I blend mine in a blender. With 1/2 a banana and soy or almond milk. SOmetimes I use a tsp of peanut butter instead of the banana. I am not a fan of the texture at all. But , healthy food isnt always the tastiest. I have had better protein mixes...I do not think I will buy more of this one."
3,If you are looking for an alternative to whey....,"Then you should know that this product doesn't taste very good and it doesn't mix very well either. I'm comparing it to Vitacost's own Rice Protein Powder which suffers from the same things this powder does and several other whey/soy protein powders. If you are trying to substitute protein in your diet and are a vegan/vegetarian/allergy sufferer, then this is an alright choice (might be better ones out there). If you are just looking for another protein powder source and aren't a vegan/vegetarian/allergy sufferer, then I would probably avoid this product."
5,Nutribiotic Vegan Rice Protein,"NUTRIBIOTIC VEGAN RICE PROTEIN Vanilla 3 lb.I find this product to be very good in contributing to my health and weight. I usually mix a tablespoon with almond milk. This give me the adequate protein to maintain muscle mass and is a light breakfast, rushing to the office. Blending it with favorite fruit is great for a snack."
3,Hard to mix and doesn't taste good,The only thing I don't like about this protein is the taste and is hard to mix in your drinks unless you use blender. I'm on week 2 using so I can't tell yet if is helping or not. I was told by my dr to use it since I don't eat meat and it might help with achy joints or muscles. I try to mix it in orange juice and inflammacore but the taste is still strong. May be next time I will try plain so I can cook in my food.
4,VERY GOOD TASTE AND CATERS TO ALLERGENICS,"Rice protein is highly assimilated, is non-allergenic and free of toxins.This one, from nutribiotic, has a very pleasant flavor (vanilla). It mixes easily in a shaker glass, an electric blender is not necessary.While hardcore bodybuilders will debate its amino acid profile compared to the more popular whey, nevertheless it is a more healthful product. Whey is the run-off of the cheese-making process, therefore an animal protein. Was the cow raised hormone and anti-biotic free? Furthermore, unflavored whey tastes like a bad dream, hence the large amounts of flavor enhancers and sweeteners used..My only beef with nutribiotic is their discontinuance of organic product. Thus, 4 stars instead of 5."
1,Not recommended,"This smells and tastes REALLY bad. I don't think this is the brand or manufacturer's fault. It's just rice protein powder in general. I tried it in shakes, I tried it in baked goods, I've tried it straight up. IT'S GROSS.If you can find some way to get a sample, then do that. DO NOT buy a tub of it, thinking you'll use it...especially if you're reluctant to buy it in the first place.The vanilla flavor is also really gross and does nothing to mask the rice powder flavor in general.Again, this is not nutribiotic's fault. Rice protein powder...just doesn't taste great."
3,OMG Gross!,"Like many other vegans, I am required to supplement so I don't feel like I am eating all day long. It is very difficult to find a good protein supplement that TASTES good. So, I am not blaming the chalky gross taste on the company. It is just gross and chalky. If you are planning to mix it with soy or almond milk and nothing else, please reconsider. I had a hard time downing it."
2,Whaaa?,"It seemed like a winner at first, but once I got it home. I discovered that the instructions say a serving is ""a heaping tablespoon""! What the hey?! I want to have an exact measurement. Don't all of us who take protein mixes seriously want that? But I can't do the whey or soy protein, so the rice is good. Hard to find a good one though. Won't buy this again."
4,"good value, others taste a bit better","rice protein has the benefit of being gluten and lactose free. compared to other rice protein's this one's a bit cheaper, however i think a few others taste a bit better. it's a tradeoff."
5,"Feel full, healthy, and save!","I love it! I recommend this product def. I have tried plenty of protein shakes and to me none of them taste like a day in the sun and this is an average tasting product. I love it for breakfast since I need the energy but, I don't need anything heavy so this was perfect. A good tasting, very filling product, not only all this but I say it's a great price! I say give it a try!"
2,wast of time,wast of time..tast badd.. mean reaallly bad ..the worst tasting protein you can experience with ...if not i guess i from outer space
3,Good for Cooking,"This stuff is great for baking with and mixing in energy bars. What it is NOT good for, is mixing in smoothies and drinks. It's gritty, and tastes awful in liquid."
2,:( rip off,Love Louisa May Alcott but only got 2 books out of 23 that it said came with it :( not appericated Amazon!! Eight Cousins & Rose Bloom
2,COMPLETE? *FAR* from it!,"I cannot begin to say how hurt I was to find that this ""complete"" works was NOT complete. In getting the ""complete"" works i was hoping for my favorite of her works, ""The Inheritance."" It wasn't there. To call this ""complete"" is an outrage!"
2,Works of LM Ascott on Kindle,The active Table of Contents does not function properly - bad programming? Can it be retrofixed?Or perhaps the download had an error. Anyway it makes getting around in the book difficult.
5,Wonderful!!,"I know I could get all these books for free, but it was much easier for me to buy this. All the MobileReference versions I have tried are wonderful. With a working table of contents, you can go directly to the book you want to read."
2,Dolphin is a dog,"This is one which people who don't care about the puzzle may enjoy, as there is a lot of theater detail. But the plot is limp and dull. One her rare failures."
5,Boyish Charm & Natural Innocence,"""The latest Bel Ami/Bruno Gmunder book is entirely dedicated to their newest mega-star Sebastian Bonnet, alone and with friends. Sebastian`s boyish charm and natural innocence are perfect for Bel Ami...""-- zebraz"
5,I love wrestling!,"If you love wrestling, especially tag team turmoil, then this excellently priced jewel is the dvd for you. Arrived quickly & was without damage unlike Highspots usually does to their dvds"
1,the worst animation ever....,"This is the worst animated movie I have ever watched . It appears to have been made by a 1st year animation student and then had his little brother do the voice over for all the characters. If you rent this movie you will regret spending any money on it.Horrible. Voices don't even match any mouth movement.So Bad. So ,so bad.I cant believe amazon let this movie be rented.Don't be tricked by the cover.The animation is much much worse.I think the voice overs were done by a call center in India over the phone.Wow ..this movie sucks!!!"
1,Truly awful!,"I had the displeasure of renting this and would have rathered to watch paint dry. The never ending song at the end was way too much and just dragged out an even more painful experience. I agree with other reviews about the poor animination, mismatched voice with lip movement and overall quality of storyline and characters. This is a poor mans version of Finding Nemo. If you get this as a gift, clearly this person hates you!! Bad, bad, bad!"
2,Please,"This sucky movie is so stupid,crudy,and weird.I hate it and DONT RENT IT OR BUY IT.That freaking giant octopus is so fat and wierd they could have done better.What about that starfish?WIERD AND STUPID!!!!!!!!That stupied dragon is so freaking stupid!!!So people,DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible,Absolutely the worst animated movie I have seen. Well except older 1980 Japanese movies which I'm guessing this is. This movie is just absolutely horrible.
2,Not So Great,"I purchased this arm sleeve a while ago and it keeps slipping off my son's arm. He is a pretty big kid too. These sleeves would be good for anybody with really big arms, otherwise I recommend buying a different sleeve in youth size."
5,NBA sleeves,"Don't like the price but love the product. I ordered these in three colors. My skin is very sun sensitive and these sleeves keep my arms covered up to prevent sun exposure. Colors are great, fit is perfect and very useful for my needs."
2,Drama Queen,"Zimmerman has no other objective in mind than chilling the spine of the audience. He achieved this by sending waves of dramatic coloring through carefully choreographed accentuations. Indeed, the first time I listened to his Barcarolle, I literally felt my spine chilled. However, he does the same thing with ALL other pieces he played, so the initial novelty decays with exponential speed. What is left is a child trying to make an impression on his parents by voicing tantrums non-stop."
4,"Solid, rockin' swing","I love swing but usually have little taste for the 1950s style of big beat and jump blues swing. But even I like Big 6 -- they've got a pounding beat you can swing hard to and they throw all their energy into their songs without going overboard into camp as do some similiar (and oddly more popular) jump blues bands. Standouts: the title track, the instrumental ""Master Blaster"" and ""Brookshire Drive"", and ""West Coast Jive."" I won't give this a full five stars becomes some of the tracks have a heavy ska influence in them and are pretty awful, but fifteen great tracks out of twenty is a super ratio for any album!"
5,Quality Made in USA product!,"These chairs are AMAZING. Do yourself a favor if you need folding chairs. Buy these and then go compare to the gargage that Home Depot, Staples, Target, and Lowe's sells. These are NOT much more expensive than the Made in China garbage sold by the Big Box no-quality stores, but they are 1000% better!"
1,Most uncomfortable chair I have ever used,"If you plan on sitting in this chair for longer than 10 minutes, look elsewhere. We use these in the conference room where I work, and literally after about 10 minutes you feel the need to either stand or constantly shift to alleviate the pain. We just had a meeting for an hour from 1:30pm to 2:30pm. It is now 5pm and my rear still hurts. Avoid if you can!!! I'm to the point of rolling my office chair into meetings."
2,Not My Favorite,"I bought this product to remove the chlorine from our swimwear after we use the indoor pool at our condo. I know that smell is a personal preference, but I don't like the fragrance of this product. To me, it smells chemical. I've used other products that have a more pleasant fragrance, so I won't choose this one again. It does help remove the chlorine, however."
1,"Dance to the music, not quite what I expected","I bought this record in order to do the class with a girlfriend so we can keep track of time and have a beat to follow. The music is fine, the beat OK. We did not like the stops between songs, other records have non-stop music. But the big disappointment was the woman counting and giving instructions for the exercises. Both my girlfriend and I are Spanish speakers and though we understand English had difficulty understanding the instructions particurlarly because there is no guide for whatever exercises this lady is doing."
5,Jim Daniels: one of America's best,"Come on people! I--devotee of Whitman, Stevens, Hart Crane, Kenneth Fearing--have looked high and low for great living American poets. Jim Daniels is definitely one. Daniels is remarkably hard hitting, funny, empathetic. He writes about work, race, religion and family. But it is his craft--music and imagery--that separate him from the pack. This book, unlike most contemporary poetry books, will stay with you after you close the covers. So buy it."
4,"Easy to read and easy to understand, for the layperson","The heading says it all. This book is a good introduction to the sometimes baffling world of legal research. Aimed at the layperson, this book is also good for high school and undergraduate courses (including paralegal)."
5,The Birth of Venus,"Dunant had me hooked in the prologue. I agree with some reviews in that, much of the slang used in the book was incongruent with the Renaissance. However, this did not retract from the story itself. I felt that the love scenes were appropriate and read as they should: coming from an older woman looking back on her life. History was manipulated just enough so as to produce a stunning historical novel without glaring alterations to the true history. The novel is delightfully unpredictable. The ""silver"" tattoo was difficult to understand, and I did not fully understand it even at the end. I did catch the artist's name, however subtle. Despite it's imperfections (which I again did not feel they took away from the story itself), I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,Time warp,"I was consistently bothered by the characters' anachronistic speech and attitudes, and the whole ""brilliant feisty woman stuck in repressive society that doesn't know what do with her"" cliche is sooo tired. I would have given this book only one star if I hadn't found the historical setting interesting. Anybody know of any good histories of this period? Without the clumsy fiction, thanks."
3,"Good, but not great","The beginning is very good. The main character, Alessandra, is extremely rich and living in Florence. Her father brings in a painter from the north to live with the family. It is very interesting for the first half or so of the book, but then the book starts getting off-topic... I had to force myself to finish it. A pretty easy read without much substance."
3,"Interesting, entertaining, not great","Few books can be described as ""great"" or Fantastic"" and this is not one of the few. Good summer escape reading with a historical foundation. The writing and character development is uneven, the ending feeling somewhat like a rushed afterthought. If it is authenticity you seek, this may not be the best choice but entertainment does not have to be rooted in absolute truth to be valid."
1,I did not enjoy this book at all! It is full of nastiness!,"I am interested in history not nastiness. I thought it would be more about the history of Florence. Instead, it was about a nun and her sexual past."
4,"Not actually about Venus, but still a great read",This was the first Sarah Dunant book that I had read. It kept me interested throughout the whole book and am looking forward to reading more of her novels.
3,Pleasant Fiction,"This is, as a feminist I'm embarassed to use this term, a woman's book..a well-written, well-conceived Gothic tale. The relation between husband and wife were amusing and the book as a whole was an enjoyable read; months later, however, it is forgettable, a good piece of entertainment, not life-changing at all."
1,Horrible Book,I don't think I've ever read anything so inane in my entire life. This novel seems to have been written by the love child of Joan Collins and an eighth grader who has just completed a dismal history report about the Renaissance. Even movies on Lifetime have better character development and plot lines.
2,Dark and Weary,"While I marveled at Sarah Dunant's masterful writing style and her uncanny ability to weave the time and place of 14th century Florence history seamlessly into her novel, I was let down by the story. The book's central character, Alessandra Checchi, comes of age, is deceived into marrying a homosexual so he can conceive a heir and protect himself against the inquisition, commits adultery with an artist, enters the convent, and commits suicide (because she was done). While I am not a pollyanna, I appreciate something that provides a positive message or at least has characters you can see virtue in. The story is weary and dark. Many characters are bleak and depressing. At each turn or twist in the plot, I was hoping that things would go the other direction. With that said, Sarah Dunant has great talent and I hope in future novels she can put her talents towards something a little less bleak."
3,Good ... but not great,"An interesting and colorful read, obviously based on extensive research and knowledge of medieval Florence. It is also informed by a love for and understanding of the art of that time. It is the story of a young woman growing up in that environment. Unfortunately, it is the weakness of that central character that causes the book to lose much of its lustre. There is far too much reliance on cliche. A ""spirited"" and ""rebellious"" young woman, chafing against the unenlightened constraints of her time. Yawn. That ground has been covered many times over and more convincingly (Jo Marsh, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.). Having lost interest in the central character, it was difficult to remain committed to the story. In the end however, the author's sure-handed conveyance of the poisonous atmosphere of intolerance and the corruption of fanaticism compensated for shortcomings of plot and character."
2,Author gives up,"The two stars are for the first two thirds of the book, which were sensitive, dazzling, and very informative about the city of Florence during the time of Savonarola. By the last third, the author seems to have lost interest entirely, and searched hopelessly for a way to conclude the book. The final third is disgusting, unconvincing, and totally phony. I put a red mark at the end of the letter to Alessandra from her husband, warning later readers to stop there, before being grossed out."
4,"Slow Start, Great Finish","I almost put this one down. The Birth of Venus, for me at least, got off to a kind of slow start. The story of Alessandra, a young woman in turbulent Florence dragged at first, but then, somewhere about 100 pages in, I couldn't put it down--the story got juicy, a little twisted, interesting. What kept me going, really, were the opening paragraphs, which tell the story of a recently deceased nun, who, upon her death, reveals something no one knew of her in life--that her torso was covered with a huge, serpent shaped tatoo. The suspense of what exactly what that was, and how it came about kept me reading Alessandra's story and I am glad I persevered. The Birth of Venus is an enjoyable story--a quick read that once you get into, you won't be able to put down."
4,Sumptuous,"This novel is a stunning, intelligent love story (surrounded by historic events) set in 15th century Florence. I'm surprised by the number of 1 star reviews. One? My hesitation to give it 5 is (as is often the case) for the ending, which did not hold up to the rest of the book. Also, it involved tattoos, a topic I have an odd aversion to. I'm curious and eager to read an earlier mystery by Dunant."
2,Not Very Impressed,"It was hard to really relate to a simpering, self involved young woman who was supposed to be ahead of her time. While the prose does paint fleeting mental images of a period in Italy's past, the character development is lacking (perhaps it is because I purchased the abridged book on CD). I felt her suicide at the end was anticlamatic and very self serving."
2,Like Eating Too Much Candy and Then Feeling Sick,"Yes, the book was interesting and it definitely had it's moments. In the end, though, it wasn't really anything more than a guilty pleasure. I won't give the ending away for those that insist on reading this piece of pop-historical fiction junk, but it was absolutely ridiculous!!! Can I add more exclamation marks?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved some of the historical details, and parts of the plot were fascinating and had a lot of potential, but come on! This book is a heaping spoonfull of softback, catchy cover layout pretension away from being a paperback romance with Fabio on the cover."
4,Historical aspect good; fictional aspect so-so,"What made this book an interesting read for me was the historical context. As a history minor, I love reading about the middle ages, and the author does a good job of describing daily life as well as historical events of a very interesting time period.Where the book lacked was in the fictional aspect. As with other readers, I didn't find the 'modern' woman aspect realistic. Unlike others, I didn't really find the sex scenes more graphic than those in, say, an Allende novel. They didn't bother me; it was just a waste of a few good trees."
4,Amusing.,"The story is not predicatable, the main character is both sweet and fiesty, the history is present but not excessive, and the book entertained me. That's all I can ask of it. I didn't want to put it down, except for a graphic childbirth scene (yuck.) Just keep in mind when reading this book that things were very different then, women thought very differently then they do now. You may not agree with all the views in this book, but you don't have to. It's for entertainment! And it's great!"
3,Interesting....,"This book didn't start out super well for me as I was expecting something much different, but it ended up being an very enjoyable read...I only wish it had started 100 pages sooner. However, everything about Florence during the late 15th century (Savanarola, bonfire of the vanities, infamous art) was fabulous and while I didn't care too much for several characters, I really enjoyed the history. Dunant throws in a few (several actually!) twists that make it a little spicy but they don't happen until somewhere in the middle.A must-read if you're going to Florence."
4,"Fast, Exciting","I flew through The Birth Of Venus. The best parts about the novel are the obscure facts and details of Florence, the Renessaince, Art and Politics. Romance looms above it all. I found myself excited by the pace and adventure, hoping for the underdog, even though, at times, the underdog was wrong or at least difficult to root for. Perhaps even stuborn, in a way. Like the images and age she describes, Sarah Dunant has really created a work of art within itself with The Birth Of Venus. I recently had the pleasure of reading a novel by another author of Italian decent by the name of Michele Geraldi. The novel is called Lucky Monkeys In The Sky, and like Venus, it follows the life of an artistic, stuborn (at times), strong-willed and passionate young woman. Fantasy is alive in these novels."
5,Luminous and stunning,"Allessandra Cecchi is a wondrous character. Ms. Dunant breathes such life and fire into her that she is unforgettable. The history, the art, the ending of the Renaissance are all written so well that the reader feels he or she is living in that turning point in time. This book is magical and filled with color and light. It is also an amazing and powerful testament to how far women have come."
5,Pulls You In From The Start,This book really pulled me in right from the start. It puts this question in your head and you find youself looking for the answer through the whole book. You do finally figure it out. This book was so exciting. I really felt for the main character and how she was able to make her life work even after finding she was married to a man that was not interested in women but in her own brother! You won't regret reading this one!
1,"Torture and pain, anyone?","Do you like vivid descriptions of torture? How about a scene where a dog is eating the intestines of a person who has had their belly sliced open? Perhaps you would enjoy genital mutilation descriptions, or the visual images that are painted about boils, the plague, and other diseases?By reading this book you are entering into a world of strict Catholicism, which turns to a world of fanatic Catholicism. Even though the main character breaks many of the rules of her Catholic world, she still describes art with the same religious words. She seems to have been raised in a modern feminist environment, yet claims to be living in the late 1400s. The author seems to be a feminist with an axe to grind, and a Catholic with a lot of mixed feelings about her religion.This book was confusing, painful, ugly, and disappointing."
3,Entertaining and forgetable,This is the perfect summer read - highly entertaining and highly forgetable. Even though I read this only a few months ago I barely remember the characters or plot however I did enjoy the book at the time. For memorable and moving reads - look elsewhere.
2,Gory and Troubling.,"This book is full of detailed descriptions of heinous crimes and gory diseases. I was expecting to read about art in the romantic Italy of the past and I couldn't listen for more than 2.5 hours. As a writer, the only value I can gain from this book is as a contrast to other similar books. Listen to Karen Essex's Leonardo's Swan and then to this book and see, how at every turn and with every choice the author makes, one can be a romantic (like Essex) or a naturalist (like Dunant). Personally, I prefer the former. I get enough gory crimes from the news."
4,Lyrical Picture,"A historical novel, with some wonderful moments. I began reading a bit tentitively, but found myself deeply involved with the developing characters and the life detailed of a very different time and place.Dunant brings light to how individuals managed their lives, when they did not fit into the rigid roles of pre/early Renaissance, Florentine culture, (independant women, artists, homosexuals).Watch for an artful conclusion to a satisfying read..."
1,Sorry- I just don't get it,I read 4 chapters in this book trying to get into it. It just trips over itself over and over dropping names and historical places/pieces of art. I found it to be highly pretentious and really silly. I know many people really enjoyed it but I'm not one.
1,Godawful!,"I read this book for a book club and it was really, really hard finishing it. I think I knew it was drivel at the very beginning but I like these women and wanted to go to bookclub. Does historical fiction just have a lower bar? We've also read Geraldine Brooks and the quality is just way below that of most of the other novels I generally read.There is a very good negative review already here (last one with one star - Simone) so please read that one for a detailed look at all the inanities in this book. My biggest general gripe is that like many other ""women's"" books, I believe it has an anachronistic feminist slant. ""The Color Purple"" is another example of this genre.This book should inspire me to write my own historical novel. Pick a picturesque setting, throw in some sex and lurid details - torture, dimemberment, plague, and rake in the dough."
1,disappointed,"After reading the reviews I bought two of the trilogy. It didn't take long to feel the author's distain for men. There wasn't an admirable one in the book. I'm no appologist for the church of the time but again, the total lack of anything good associated with it's clergy, religious or their followers was over the top ""hateful"". It is void of any historical reality. Throw in a splash of explicit erotica and foul language to make it completely predictable and shallow."
1,Waste of Time,One shred of historical knowledge will cause you to trash this book by a few chapters. It was one of the most STUPID pieces of TRASH that I have picked up this year. I wouldn't wish this brain dead idiocy on my worst enemy.
1,"Practice what you preach, lady!","You know what they say about glass houses, right? Beware!I didn't like this book. I did however like this writer's first one. Girl With A Pearl Earring was a much better story. If you must read The Birth of Venus check it out at your local library."
1,One hot product,I bought this book for a quick speed read on a flight to Los Angelos and let me tell you it was hot stuff !!! I read it three times on thefirst flight and another two on the returning flight. Hot stuff is this book !!!
3,Enjoyable,I enjoyed this book. It is a subject I haven't read anything on before but perhaps might do so again in the future - as I don't really know much about art and religion of that era I did find it a little overwhelming at times but nothing too taxing. I love the historical aspect and I hope to add more historical novels to my list. It's the story of Alessandra's life I enjoyed and her journey to find her way.
2,Modern sensibilities,"A friend breathlessly recommended this book. I can't do the same. The plot is slow to develop. The characters, with the exception of the mother and the husband, are generally unlikeable. The mother and the husband are more modern than renaissance in their tone and character. The actions of the lead character seem implausible for the time, or indeed, any time. Finally, the writing is simply inelegant and uninteresting.I love Florence. I am a plague scholar and a ""fan"" of the renaissance. I would have loved to love this book. Sadly, I cannot."
3,Interesting...but not quite to my expectations.,"I suppose that I held a bit more of an expectation for this novel than usual because of the time it sat on my bookshelf until I found the opportunity to read it...and perhaps that added to my slight disappointment in it. Although Dunant writes with a mostly smart and rather seductive language, I found myself a bit tired of all the ""modern"" twistings and soap-opera antics by midway through the book. At times, the main character Alessandra speaks as if dictating passages of a sexually repressed sixteen year old's diary, and being wrapped up in her thoughts took me away from the whole feel and magic of the Italian Renaissance. I enjoyed the story, but I could not immerse myself in the true history, beauty and the art of the era, which I had hoped would be a large part of the novel's intrigue."
3,"was ok, not best-seller material","The anachromisms kill me. I can't stand a historical novel written by someone who has failed to do their research on the time period they are discussing. This is a good read for those interested in the art of early renaissance florence, in the early renaissance. It was more enriching for me to read it knowing about the artists and political figures they are discussing. If you don't know about it, don't rely on the book to teach you. You need backround information, because Dunat will not tell you. It's easy to get through, which makes it a more appealing read, it flows well, but the end was terrible, rushed, and forced. All in all, I want a better view of early Renaissance Florence, it's culture and politics, a better ending, and more research."
3,Fiction as Travel Companion,"I read this book while traveling to and visiting Florence. It was perfect. As I read about the past, I experienced the same venues in the present. It enhanced my visit to this magical city in delightful and unexpected ways."
1,Gave up after 120+ pages,"I know I'm going to be in the minority here, but I could not get into this book. I tried, I really did but I found nothing to interest me, no chemistry between the two main characters, I couldn't find anyone or anything to care about and if I want to read about a serial killer run loose I will pick up the next Ann Rule book. It was all I could do to not throw the book across the room.If you feel you will enjoy this book based upon other reviews, get it from the library first. Then if you love it, buy it. I am sorry I wasted my money. JMHO."
3,Dissappointing,"I had high hopes for this book but was not impressed by the flowery language, weak plot and downright gross and awkward descriptions of the love scenes. I thought there was no point to this book and it's hard to believe the other glowing reviews in the press."
1,A bodice ripper disguised as a work of fiction,"Yea, yea. A liberated woman ahead of her time, trapped in a world she can't control, passionate about art and an artist, unconventional and willing to take risks - a plot as predictable as Dick and Jane. The only saving grace: historical references to the Medici and the religious fervor that gripped the city in the 15th century, and descriptions of buildings in and around Florence. But way too few to give this book any right to be called historical fiction. This is a bodice ripper with the pretensions of being something better."
3,GIFTED WRITER....but this book...Not Her Best,"I was enthusiastic about this novel. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The protagonist, Alessandra, is not sympathetic and it's very difficult to bring oneself to care about her struggles. The novel does have a few redeeming qualities - Dunant's skill with words and her knowledge of Florence. Her descriptions of life in Renaissance Florence are fascinating and carried me through the novel even when I had lost patience with the narrative. In fact, all of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Dunant is definitely a skilled writer but this book is not her best."
1,Melodramatic Harlequin,"I thought I would love this book: it covers a time of art history I am both familiar with and enjoy, it centers around a girl who loves art, and it had romance. I was wrong.The plot is redundant and obvious and the prose cliche. The character's thoughts were full of self pity and self aggrandizement ad nauseam. When ""big plot twists"" are revealed at the end of the book, all I could think of was, ""Oh! please."" Even these were cheap and predictable. I found my art history text books on the subject more enjoyable.The only redeeming points were a few well-produced characters and some descriptions of Florence."
3,"Parts approach literature, others pander to sales.","Most of this book was interesting, giving one a glimpse into the limited and protected life of a wealthy young woman of the period whose parents are upwardly mobile and who want her to make a good marriage. It also paints the setting of Florence well, including the religious, artistic and political influences, but the ending and a few other passages seemed rushed and even, perhaps, to have been written by a different writer. This last part feels so different and appears to me to have been included for the sake of sensationalism and to boost sales. The book would have been better without it."
2,Historical Romance Novel With Some Forrest Gump,"Basically a light entertaining read with a little history (I think) thrown in for good measure. I mistakenly thought it would be a thought-provoking novel about some piece of art only to find out that it was a disguised romance novel set in Florence in the mid 1400s during a time of religious upheaval and fervor. The heroine is an awkward, unique woman (who of course doesn't know that she's beautiful) who first fights with and then falls in love with a reclusive (but fascinating and mysterious) painter. She marries another man out of necessity but still longs for the man she could never have (because of her position or whatever -- in other words, fill in the blank). At the end the reader is shocked at the actual identify of the painter. The first clue was when he was never identified by name -- only by the term ""the painter."" Hmmmm could that be a hint that this is referring to some famous painter? Definitely a beach read -- just hide the cover."
2,Great Story Falls Flat,"The setting and story of The Birth of Venus were engaging enough, but the writing left me feeling flat. Too often the author used excessive adjectives and adverbs and melodramatic language rather than really making me understand the characters through their dialogue and action. The book seems a good first draft, and with some revision it could be a great novel, but as it is the characters are flat, uncomplicated stock characters, and the reading felt too plot based. I never really felt the complicated emotions of these characters and this setting, and though the plot pulled me forward, it was not a memorable read."
2,loved and believed everything but the ending,"With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated."
1,the birth of venus,"i'm glad i borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. the characters are so not believeable. for a fourteen year old she seems too knowledgeable about history and politics, and what is with her very hostile relationship with her brothers? Sure there is a lot of sibling rivalry, but don't these characters ever grow up and develop some kind of maturity and insight? The prologue was remarkably interesting, and I was hooked, but it was a downward plunge till the end. the painter seems to have made a 180-degree character change when he reappears in the end after a long absence. the plot, characters and coherence of incidents are very loosely interwoven, and very inconsistently developed. a very unbalanced, tedious book."
1,Poorly written. Gratuitous violence added for shock value.,"I did not enjoy reading this book, and I returned it. It was difficult to read because it was so poorly written. In addition, the story contained too much unnecessary violence added for shock value. I don't think it was necessary to be so graphic; a good writer can describe these things more eloquently. I have read much better books on this topic."
1,Much Too Graphic,"I chose this book for my book club based on reviews and a recommendation from a friend. However, I would warn other book club leaders to read it first before including it as a selection. It is extremely graphic and this detracts from the story. The author certainly researched her subject very well but why she had to include such explicit sexual passages is beyond me. I received phone calls from club members very upset with the book and I'm embarrassed that I ever selected it."
1,great if you're looking for a romance novel,"I read a few very good reviews of this book, so I picked it up. What a disappointment. The author tries to hard to disguise this trash as historical literature and it comes off as neither. It's not bad enough to be a good summer romance novel and good enough to be called anything else."
2,I returned it,"I didn't read much of this book. I didn't want to give it one star because it sounded like there might be an interesting story hiding somewhere in there.If there was, I didn't get to it. I read the first 50 pages of the book, and then skipped around a little bit. I was extremely annoyed by the writing style and I wondered how something like that could have been published.The writer kept switching tense. One paragraph she would be talking in present. The next paragraph she was talking in past. No, it wasn't because she was talking about different times. She would be talking about the same exact incident in different tenses.How can an author who can't even keep their tenses straight write a novel that gets published and goes to the bestseller shelf in barnes and noble?"
2,"The Birth of Venus, A Bit Like A History Course.","The Birth of Venus may be more enjoyed by those who have a deep (very deep) interest in frescoes, france, and late 1400's politics. I am not that person. I felt that the author used a painful amount of details about the politics of the time to fill pages. Some of it was necessary for the story, but most if it seemed a bit like a history buff that likes the sound of their voice and depth of their own knowledge. I could have gotten beyond that if the story's ending had not left me wondering: what was the point of telling this girl's story?"
3,Entertaining Historical Novel!,"&#65279;Dunant's historical/thriller is set in Florence during the brief time when Savonarola, the fanaticmonk, kept its citizens under his thrall. The protagonist, a young girl who longs to be an artist,describes her sheltered life and her attempts to be creative in a society that does not allow womenfreedom. There are several mysterious events she unravels in the process. Dunant's writingstyle is quite good, she creates characters that are lively and robust. The heroine is a little toocontemporary to be believable, but otherwise well done. Definitely an author to read again."
3,"Read ""Agony and the Ecstasy"" Instead","This is a pretty good novel about Rennaisance Florence. The history of the period is interwoven into a compelling story about a young female artist in the time of Savonarola. If you are reading this because you want to acquaint yourself with some Italian history before a trip to Italy, I recommend a far better book,""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" by Irving Stone."
2,Left me dissatisfied,I read this book fairly quickly and it was an easy read. I kept waiting for the book to pick up... but it never did. The ending was abrupt and left me dissatisfied.
4,Not too bad for a class assignment,"I was assigned this book for an art history research methods class. The class teaches students how to write an art history research paper, but it focuses on art in Florence under the control of Savonarola. This book is one of my favorites as far as required reading goes. My mother read it for her book club as well and it seemed like they found it enjoyable. We were warned that there were some slightly graphic sexual passages. I found some these sections to be a bit superfluous. They can be awkwardly cringe worthy and don't necessarily add anything to the overall story. Still, I found the rest of the story interesting and I would recommend it to anyone interested in historically based fiction."
2,Great Novel Material wasted,"The beginning of the book is catching enough to alure readers to unfold the story. But as the pages turn, the fascination is changed to impatience. The writer has unnecessary descriptions to occupy too many paragraphs, and the heroine, who has totally gained reader's empathy at the beginning, shows her egotism and narcissism which grew unbearable especially after she finds out her husband to be a gay, which fact seems to give her a perfect excuse to indulge her long-developed fancies upon the young painter."
2,All the Right Elements -- But Fails to Deliver,"Dunant's book doesn't live up to its rather shockingly theatrical first chapter ""hook."" It has all the right elements for an intriguing historical fiction but Dunant fails to link them together in any coherent, compelling way. Moreover, her protagonist, supposedly clever and extremely well-read for a woman of her time, is remarkably naive and addled-brained, constantly taking direction from her clear-thinking, authoritative maid. From there, I lost interest."
3,Fun Little Nerf Gun,This nerf gun is perfect for an unsuspecting brother. It fits in your pocket and packs quite a punch if you pump it enough. You can't beat the price and it's a fun little gun.
3,Careful What You Wish For...,"I was really excited when buying this, and it worked out well for a bit. Unfortunately before too long, it came across an AIR LEAK. Unless you can cope with that, I would think twice about this pistol."
1,Piece of junk,My son got it for Easter and it doesn't work. It didn't come with directions so I got online but it still doesn't work. I am really ticked. Something my son was so excited about and it doesn't even work. Don't waste your money even though it is only a few dollars. JUNK!!!!!!!!
5,wrong image,i got ripped off i got the secret strike as-1 even tho the image and description say's secret target strike they need to et their stuff straight and i want a refund or the secret target strike. I already have a secret strike AS-1 i give the toy five stars but not the seller
4,Great reference book,"The main reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I only have read 3 books on the subject.I bought it about 2 years ago, browsed thru it once then let it gather dust. I picked it up about a year ago and have probably referenced it 1 to 2 times a week, since. I guess I had to figure out how to use it. Or figure out that since it gives you all of the possible benefits/negatives of a particular herb, I could be much more precise in choosing the correct herb, staying away from a herb that might give me what I want, but also create another problem.I also like that you can either start from the actual herb first to see what it helps, or start from a general condition that you want to improve on and find the herbs that fit or find a specific condition and the herbs that work for that.Also, if you are into finding herbs in the wilde, which I'm not, I couldnt imagine a better book for you."
5,EXCELLENT RESOURCE,"This is the book by which I learned the bulk of my herbal knowledge - Knowledge of plants, their medicinal uses and how to harvest , process and store them. Excellent for beginners or seasoned herbalists alike, it is intelligently written, yet simple to understand. It is written in plain language, yet introduces readers to a wealth of medical terminology. After nearly 15 years of using this book, it is still the one I bring with me when I go out into the greenhouse, garden or woods."
3,Not so Complete,"This softcover book by John Lust is actually a short write up of herbs. It does not go into any detail about the chemical compounds of the herbs that determine their effectiveness. It's the Reader's Digest version. If that it what you want, then this book is for you. On the other hand, if you really want a comprehensive look at herbs, there are better books out there such as the ones by Rosemary Gladstar, David Hoffman, James Green that come to mind."
3,The Herb Book,"I gave the Herb Book three stars. It is a good reference book but it is a bit overwhelming, and very vague in some areas. I personally would have cauterized it different, and would have given more instructions about how to use the plants in everyday use."
5,Everything you wanted to know and more,"I bought this book in hard back many years ago. Its an aladins cave of info with cures, dyes, mineral content, vitamin content - you name it. I just bought this again for christmas presents this year - I hope the recipients get as much information and practical pleasure as I have over the years.An absolute must for thse interested in herbs and their many properties and uses."
5,A great herb guide,"This book is a great guide to tons of herbs! Although it doesn't have fancy colored pictures the 275 sketches are still great! It tells you about the herbs, what part to use of the herb, and if the plant is for external use or internal.(like comfrey is only for external uses) IT was very interesting learning that holly and other plants, that many people use for decoration can help cure you somehow! It also tells you about the helpful fruits! This book might appear large in the picture but it fairly small.(probably a little bit over a foot in length and 4 or 5 inches wide.)This a great book to get to learn about all the herbs Ect. I highly recommend this book for everyone! Although i wish it was hardcover."
5,A film long overdue for affordable release!!,"'Malcolm' is an hilarious film, which got very-little play in 1986 when first released. Then, ever after, videotapes were only available at outlandish prices. This long-overdue DVD release is most welcome. 'Malcolm' is a quirky and ultimately-loveable film. Now that it's available on DVD, I say 'buy it!'."
4,'Malcolm' is Fun and Charming,"""Malcolm"" is a charming, sweet and very funny film about a 'slow' young man who happens to be a brilliant gadget maker. After unjustly losing his job he takes in a male/female couple to make ends meet: The guy is a stupid petty thief and his girlfriend is a smart, good-hearted woman who takes care of Malcom's best interests. The couple plan a daring bank heist with the aid of Malcolm's ingenious gadgets, which are hilarious and inventive. Sit back and let the film charm you."
2,Not what thay should be.,I bought a can of these about a mounth ago and thay were great. I wanted more so I bought a case of them on Amazon and thay are not the same quality. The taste is the same but the Latte center is about 1/4 of what the ones in the can were. Must be cutting costs or somthing. Won't order again.
1,Bad Batch,"I've been enjoying Bali's Best Latte Candy for over a year now, but the pack of 12 bags that I received today are of sub-standard quality. It seems that the centers collapsed during the process, as there is almost none of the latte cream in the middle. I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing these again."
4,An excellent update of Ben Hogans' classic by the same name.,"Possessing one of the simpliest and classically crafted golf swings of any professional, Steve Elkington makes the vision come to life with excellent practical instruction accompanied by wonderful photographs. The format is basically the same as the Hogan classic. Starting with grip, and proceeding to downswing and follow-through, Elkington's interpretation is fresh and better explained than Hogan's. The drawings in the Hogan book are still classic and in Elkington's book are replaced by great photographs. Read the section on the grip and what to do with the thumbs, I'm sure you'll find that tip alone is something you haven't heard and well worth the price. This book belongs in every comprehensive golf library."
2,Not great.,"This book was worth one read through. There are much better instruction books out there. Typical of all golf instruction books, Elkington belittles the philosophy of others; then doesn't offer much to support his criticism.The book avoids quick fix solutions and maintains the 5 core fundamentals, but I thought I would enjoy it much more than I did."
3,now I know what back spasms feel like,There is some good work that went into this book. You really feel like you understand about Steve Elkington's swing. The pictures are great. I've also never had back spasms before until giving Elkington's book a try. Beware the man who advises a violent turn of the abs toward the rib cage...ouch!
2,Missing features and irresponsive customer service,"I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years). But since then their customer service has become hopeless. Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing. I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it. They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features. But the processor is slow. I have to reboot it atleast once a day. If you have the phone , wife and gps on , most time it hangs. Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess. For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc. Not worth the price."
2,Missing features and bad (zero) customer service,"I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years). But since then their customer service has become hopeless. Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing. I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it. They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features. But the processor is slow. I have to reboot it atleast once a day. If you have the phone , wi-fi and gps on , most time it hangs. Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess. For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc. Not worth the price. I hope someone can come up with a faster processor and more main memory so you can keep all working without having to reboot."
4,HIS MUSICAL !,"I 've just read the firt customer review and wanted to say I totally agree with his opinion.No doubt about it:UP AGAINST IT deserves a much better place than the one he's got in the opinion of real Toddheads (in fact I think many of them don't even really know the existence of this item in his discography).Still, it's Todd concentrating on melodies,vocal harmonies, drum machines and keyboards:we,Todd fans ,all know what it means!I only put 4 stars just because, the project being a musical for Broadway,his maverick musical spirit is nowhere to be seen here.But what gorgeous melodies!"
4,Baseball Almanac Book Review,"Refreshingly different. For those seeking something less than the number crunching books but more than just another history lesson, Baseball and Philosophy delivers providing the serious fan with a series of short essays aimed at America's baseball institution. Taken from our (www.baseball-almanac.com) full review done February 28, 2004)."
1,Not for me,"After reading this book, I'm convinced that philosophy and baseball don't mix. Reading each chapter, I felt that there could've have been more in depth discussion about philosophy and baseball. Some chapters were unbearable - (e.g. why steriods should be legal.) Not only because the result is antithetical to my own thinking but the way it was argued."
1,Transaction Fine -Product was Cheaply Made and Defective,"Plumb used to be a premier US manufacturer of tools, especially axes and hammers. This brick hammer was an import that had a cheaply cast head that was mounted on the shaft at about 20 degrees off perpendicular. Put another way, it would be useless by a professional for shaping or chipping any type of brick. Amazon promptly covered the return at it's expense; I immediately replaced this hammer with an Estwing which was more expensive but far superior."
2,Poorly Finished,"I bought this saw to prepare roughouts for my wood carving hobby. Although it does work well enough, there was a piece of sharp metal where the handle is attached to the frame.After slicing open my finger, I filed down the area which is what should have been done at the factory before packaging. If this is how Nicholson finishes its products, I would certainly not recommend purchasing anything with the Nicholson name on it."
1,Botched digital remastering of beautiful recordings,"The Brahms Clarinet Quintet and Op. 18 Sextet recordings by the Amadeus Quartet have deep personal meaning for me and I have owned the performances on LP since I was a teenager. A few nights ago, I listened to the Quintet as reissued here on my second stereo system (mid-fi units) and again marvelled at the music's flow and passion, the eloquent performances -- and was about ready to just turn it off during the Scherzo. That's how bad the remastering is on this set - grainy, harsh treble, lack of warmth, haze.The problems afflict all the pieces. Really a darn shame because it should be a marvel. Do not purchase."
2,Review of the Mummy,"This book is a disappointment to any Ann Rice fan who expects the same thrills and suspense that was lived while reading ""The Vampire Chronicles"". Although the novel is based on a fascinating and intriguing history of the times of the ancient Egyptian civilization, and a lot of research has gone into portraying an accurate account of early 20th century Egypt, (ask me I am Egyptian) I still feel that the plot was not up to Ann Rice standards and was extremely predictable to the reader. My disatisfaction in the book reached a climax in the very end where I had expected Ann Rice to make one of her famous twists to give the reader some sort of fulfillment even if it was towards the end, unfortunately it never came. However, I still am a big fan of Ann Rice and continued reading lots of her other titles."
4,Not for beginners,"This is a fine book, with a lot of good material. But much of it is of medium difficulty, and some of it I still can't touch after five years of playing fingerstyle. That's very frustrating. I really like some of the songs on the CD, and it's terribly disappointing to see the described as ""beginner,"" and then find that I can't even begin to play them.It would probably be easier to play some of the stuff if it was played more slowly on the CD, with some tips and hints, and then played up to speed. But the CD only has full-speed renditions of full songs.Nevertheless, there are some things that relative beginners can sink their teeth into. I also like simply listening to the songs on the CD."
3,NOT for beginners,"Stefan Grossman is a fine guitarist and his books have done wonders for fingerstyle guitarists everywhere. But--his books are NOT for beginners! I bought this book hoping to learn some new techniques and found several of the arrangements quite difficult, and many in alternate tunings. Most have words accompanying the tunes, so that these are types of Travis-picking backgrounds, of a sort. You should have been playing guitar for a few years, steadily, before you attempt the tunes in this book."
4,Great stage presence,"There's not much more to say about Daniel O'Donnell that hasn't been said elsewhere. His Rock and Roll Show brings back all the songs I knew back in the 50s, 60s and seventies. He has been a major star in Europe for many years and his philanthropies are legend. A great singer and a great video!"
1,Useless recording,"THIS CD is not playable on normal CD players; it is made for ""Super Audio"" ONLY. No warning of this is indicated on the Amazon listing."
4,Great family movie,"I thought this was a great family movie. While it won't hold the attention of the younger kids, older children will enjoy it. The acting is wonderful, especially the ""young lass"", what a great part for her. Too bad about the cynical review earlier, but that's what I expect from profession movie critics, they are out to pick apart the film itself, where I am looking for entertainment factor for myself and for my family. As for MY family, we thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
4,The Safari Chronicles,I love this book!This is an engaging and familiar story that you'll enjoy. In this outstanding book I felt like I was reintroduced to people I once knew and now I want to get to know even more...This is an outward journey to a place deep within all of us. You will never forget The Safari Chronicles. Enjoy your trip!
5,More than an adventure!,"There are stories you can put down and come back to later. This is not one of them. Once I started it, I read it at break time, lunch time and bed time... every chance I could get.Rick's talent is in weaving an edge-of-your-seat tale with all the elements of a great story: interesting characters, descriptive settings, several layers of conflict, escalating conflict, a terrific resolution. And then he adds to that a message based on three, timeless ""secrets"" woven into the protagonist's adventure, secrets that get at the heart of every human experience. I can't tell you the secrets... because they're secret!As Jim, the main character, got deeper and deeper into the challenges of his safari adventure, I got insight that applies to my personal adventures as well. Having read Safari Chronicles cover to cover, I'm now heading back through it to write the Safari secrets into my own journal, knowing that they will inform my own journey as well."
4,A book about style that won't go out of style,"Hine's book is a meticulously researched, wonderfully illustrated work on how the American mindset of the 1950s and 1960s created both the consumer culture and the physical environment in which it thrives. All of this is masquerading as an enjoyable, nostalgic, amusement park ride through the world of split-level houses, tail finned cars, and orange Naugahyde-upholstered furniture. It's a fun read for all baby boomers as well as for any of their children who are trying to figure out why their parents think pink and green go together. By the way, I also recommend this book to any Europeans trying to understand American culture. Read this and the short story ""The Concrete Mixer"" by Ray Bradbury and you'll understand why McDonalds and Wal-Mart can't be stopped."
4,Wonderful!,"I am planning an unorthodox ""planned-elopement-destination-wedding"" to Las Vegas. When I tell people that I'm eloping, but not in the traditional sense of the word, I often cite this book to back up my view that the word ""elope"" has evolved over the years. With every page I found myself saying ""Exactly!"" ""That's how I feel!"". I related to the book more than any bridal magazine or website out there. Highly recommended!"
5,Fabulous Elopment Book When You Don't Know Where to Begin,The book gives creative and fun ideas for couples looking for something different. I would highly recommend the book to any couple not sure about a traditional wedding. I loved that it also gave resources such as web sites and phone numbers.
3,"Not as good as ""Beyond Vegas""","I bought this book as soon as my fiance and I were engaged, excitted about the prospect of eloping. Reading it will get you excited about eloping, show you that it can be done, and give you some general ideas as to how to start the process, but when it comes down to it, the book does not offer that great of advice.I highly recommend that you consider buying ""Beyond Vegas"" by Lisa Tabb and Sam Silverstine instead of ""Let's Elope."" We ended up buying both of them in the end, and actually using the information in BV to plan our wedding in Scotland. Unlike with Let's Elope, the authors actually got married in all of the destinations discussed in there books, and give all the pointers you need, not just what can be found on the official country registrar web sites.Have fun with it. But don't buy two books when one will do."
2,Not for those already sold on eloping,"I bought this book hoping for some research on wedding locations. Instead, this book spends a bit of time in each chapter reminding you of the benefits of eloping and querying you to make certain you want to elope.I know I don't want a wedding. I was just hoping for some well-researched advice on locations where I could get married and have my marriage legal in the US. Felt too much like a traditional wedding book to me."
2,I love gummi bears,"I really love gummi bears. I saw these online and I had to try them, I have never had pink or blue gummi bears like it shows in the picture, which made me willing to pay the considerable price for them. Well, there aren't any pink or blue gummi's in the bag. My disappointment abounds! I won't buy these again, not at the price I paid. Don't get me wrong, they were really good, I enjoyed eating them, but they weren't everything I hoped for and WAY overpriced."
1,poor product design,Not worth the money! The handles get too hot to touch. The pans are really thin and do not heat well.
5,LPN is the GREATEST!,"as i wondered through a CD store, the LPN CD caught my eye and i bought it! i LOVE LPN! i love their unique style and all those groovy songs they re-did, like Pennies From Heaven, Hot For Teacher, etc. i'm buying their new CD, Swing is Dead, as soon as possible. my advice, if you don't already own this CD, go BUY IT! :)"
5,Swing this,"I had never heard of LPN before a friend played this CD for me. I have heard lots of live CDs from all sorts of bands, and none have had the energy and style that this has. LPN is not your ordinary swing band. They cover classic swing tunes like ""Pennies from Heaven"" and ""Sing Sing Sing"", and they make swing versions of songs like They Might Be Giant's ""Istanbul"" and Van Halen's ""Hot for Teacher"". They also have original songs like ""Mississippi Darling"" and ""Big Pants Dance"". LPN is fun, energetic, and absolutely one of a kind. Don't miss out on this."
3,all most there,"these guys swing! lots of energy and potential. this cd is good for there first, but the next release needs some professionalism in the recording. come on nails, get in the studio. i saw these guys at the filmore, they should of recorded that show. and what a show!"
5,Captures a fun moment in time,"Ah, the late lamented, demented Lee Press-On & The Nails. They were a San Francisco Bay Area band that had been around several years before swing hit it big in the late '90s. For awhile they were ubiquitous in the area, with their energetic, manic show. This is their first album and it catches the sense of what it was like to be in their audience at the time.Later albums were more polished, and members of the band changed over the years, (frankly, the band was better later - some of these guys must have had a few drinks before this set) but this is still an entertaining CD to listen to, and a document of the short but fun swing revival."
1,You have got to be kidding,"This is an attempt at swing gone horribly, horribly wrong. Let's start with Mr. Press-On. His singing transforms what might be a passable band into a fiasco. If singing ranges were highways, Mr. Press-On would be a two rut dirt road. He seems to model himself on Cab Calloway but is missing one key ingredient: talent. His intonation is bad, his range non-existant, and his voice uninteresting. The Nails have a heavy cross to bear with Mr. Press-On but don't do much to lighten their load. I'm certain there are a few good musicians mixed into the cacophany but they are mostly submerged. They don't seem to have the concept of ""dragging the beat"" that is essential to good swing music. They are sometimes amusing when seen live, but the album exposes their weaknesses all too clearly. Sorry, but it's a waste."
1,what's all the hype about?,"i'm always on the look-out for a good swing cd and after reading the rave reviews i decided to pick this one up. all i can say is OOPS! after re-reading the comments i guess i have to see them live to understand what the appeal is, as it certainly doesn't translate in this poor recording with heinous horn solos and a female singer who seems to be a bit tone-deaf. a band member's girlfriend perhaps?"
4,Fast and furious!,"Lee Press-On and the Nails do have a humor, much more than The New Morty Show. The album is recorded live! Tom Beyer (stand-up bass) played on Mortified album of New Morty Show. It contains mostly well known covers (like Sing, Sing, Sing, Caldonia, Pennies From Heaven, ...) but very fast versions that goes even faster,and three originals (Big Pants Dance, Deal Me In, Mississippi Darling). It includes not mentioned bonus track Jumpin'Jive."
4,"If ever a SWING there was, This is It!!!","If you are into swing, or even if you aren't, this is the album you have to have. Non stop fun, hilarity, and just an all around good time. If you can stop this disc halfway thru, then there must be something wrong with you. The full range of swing is covered, along with some regular jazz and more! From R. Scott's ""Powerhouse"" (ever watch Bugs Bunny?)to Duke Ellington's ""Seen the Light"", From B. Goodman's ""Sing Sing Sing"" to the Nail's very own ""Mississippi Darlin"" it's got it all. Make this a must have, if you don't like it, go get a CAT scan, I'm serious."
5,The group Rocks my choral director turned me on to them,They are awesome too bad they haven't gone big because more people need to hear about them!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Whets the appetite for more, but....","...let's be honest. This was recorded live, and man, it shows. You can really hear every last mistake and flaw. The poor sound quality really puts a damper on what would otherwise be a real five-star recording. If, for their second recording, they just did studio versions of every song here, it would be just amazing. Still, warts and all, ""Jump Swing From Hell"" does serve as a good introduction to a band I've seen and enjoyed a dozen times already and am looking forward to seeing again. (Oh, if you do get this CD, I recommend you play it LOUD.)"
4,Begging for MORE!,"From the humour and nostalgia of ""Putting The Fun Into Self-Loving"" to the gritty worlds of ""Begging For Change"", this collection of shorts is guaranteed to entertain. If you enjoy nostalgia, romance, comedy, or have ever been robbed at gunpoint by a couple of drag queens, you'll enjoy this compilation. See the beginnings of young love. Witness the dramatic turns a life can take with just the toss of a coin. Watch one man's journey for that ultimate reward, and take a trip back in time to those wonderful ""health films"" of the 1950s. Oh yes, and enjoy the eye candy along the way."
3,lebra,"the lebra looks good on my sons car, but, when we put it on,we had to stretch the product so much, that it ripped on one corner of the fender."
5,better than a week on the beach,"Excellent, recommend without reservation. Note: for anyone like me who is hooking it up to an older G4 desktop 450, I also needed to buy a Radeon Graphics card for about $200, which included the DVI to VGA connector. I would have considered a new hard drive, but what with the intel flurry still going on, seemed best to wait. The 23"" seems huge and I am glad I did not go with the 30"". I saw comments about redness, etc., and my experience is that the screen renders image color and resolution accurately and beautifully. I now see onscreen what I used to have to print out to check with the older mac 17""."
5,Love this moniter!,"After reading the reviews here, I hesitated about buying this display for a long time. Now, I have purchased one and have used it for 3 months and can state it is by far the best I've used in 20 years of all-day computer work on perhaps 16 systems. I've had zero problems with the dead pixels or the pink screens or any other issues. This is much easier on my eyes and causes less strain that my 15 inch Powerbook G4 display. I'd say buy it!"
1,18 months death,"My husband bought this monitor in September of 2006. Now it is dead. If you don't have money to burn, don't buy this monitor.--Rene"
5,big and beautiful laptop accesory,"I got this monitor along with a keyboard. When I get home I plug my laptop into both and I have a huge screen to do my work on. The colors are terrific, the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen. Wish I had done this a long time ago!"
1,Nice monitor need replacing every two years,"I had a 22 inch cinema display. After a year and a half it would not start and gave me an intermittent black screen when I started up my G5. I decided to get a newer 23 inch display thinking nothing of it. After another year and a half, the same problem happened. I must say that this is an overpriced piece of hardware and I will never buy another one again. I have a viewsonic monitor that cost me almost nothing in comparison to the cinema display and it is still going strong after 3 years.I would advise do not get one unless you don't mind wasting money, or want to use it as a TV tray when it breaks down, which is usually after the warranty."
1,You will only be dissapointed by this display.,"I own an Apple 23"" Cinema Display, and I wish I didn't. The display is very unevenly lit making it very difficult to do serious work such as retouch photographs. There are color casts that vary from side to side which make the monitor impossible to correct using calibration. It looks sexy... but the ""engine"" is a two stroke, smoke making, oil drippin, noisy piece of junk. After you purchase it you will want to return it so why waste the energy and the costs of shipping it back and forth. Just look elsewhere. If you NEED to have a cinema display buy the 20"" or the 30"" - I wish I had."
2,Buyer beware...,"I am having color problems with this monitor; it has a pinkish haze and the left side of the screen is washed out about an inch. It was OK the first day I had it, but the problems showed up after a day or two of use. Re-calibrating the monitor does help -- but does not eliminate -- the pinkish haze, and the washed-out part is there no matter what.There are many posts on the Apple Support boards about others with the same problem. You may want to consider this, and hopefully Apple will adknowledge a design flaw in these models soon."
2,poor color consistency,"Lots of great features in this display plus it's design is very appealing especially next to the Apple Macintosh G5 tower........But, the color inconsistency and backlighting problems with the two monitors I have had are a big problem if you plan to do serious photo editing or any application that requires accurate color. If that is not the case it should be fine. However, it seems to me that for this price there should be little if any compromise. I'd suggest checking out Apple's discussion forums before buying this display"
2,The most beautiful display ever...but PINK!!!!!,"My first new 23""display had the famous PINK casting problem (see MacFixit.com or Apple forum) and I returned it. 2 weeks later, I received a new one with the same problem... PINK...and a slightly darker area in the middle of the display. I tried in vain to calibrate the monitor with SPYDER PRO, but the pink casting usually comes back 1-2 days later. The display is gorgeous, and I'm really disappointed that I need to return it. Hopefully Apple will soon fix this problem or recall this product."
2,Doesn't work reliably with PCs,"Despite Apple advertising this monitor as working with PCs - ""This DVI connection also removes all barriers to using an Apple display with a PC. If your graphics card supports DVI with DDC technology for widescreen viewing, you should be able to use these two displays with a PC."" - it does not do so reliably. I tried three different cards and all exhibited insurmountable problems. Even if someone has declared a particular graphics card model to work with their display, don't count on yours working with your display. Apple tech support admitted that compatibility is an issue, and could not even suggest a card that is known to work. Mine is going back."
2,Check the return policy on this...,"Easily one of the best displays I've ever seen! Unfortunately I've got the color consistency problems, even after Apple has taken the display back for repair.Make sure that you can return the monitor if you experience these problems as Apple does not yet acknowledge the color problems with this model exist!"
2,NPR what I expected at ALL !!!,Not what I was expecting....book has a strange smell like old paper....print smaller than I expected..wish I would have just gotten the standard version...thought this was some special anniversary edition...not impressed
3,Was hoping for better,I found the earlier part of the book more interesting than the belabored latter part. The book needed a good editor. The number of grammatical mistakes and typos was far more than should be allowed in a scholarly book of this type.
5,Medical Terminology A Systems Review,"I received the book with CD as a gift because I will be entering the field of medicine. The book and CD are easy to follow and I have learned more than I ever expected in medical terminology.The book is easy to follow and prepares you to read medical reports and to learn thousands of medical terms, including diagnostic, symptomatic, and surgical terms. The pronunciations help me pronounce words correctly when I talk to the medical staff at the hospital.I recommend this book highly."
3,maybe fun for younger ones,"messy, of course...my 8 year old was over it...but I imagine that a three year old might have a great time with it... gooey paint, smear it around on rainbow paper...that's pretty much it..."
1,A poor value,"This toy is exactly as represented in the description - ten sheets of glossy, multicolored paper, two little containers of black paint, and a foam paintbrush. One uses it by smearing the black paint on the paper, then adding texture by dragging household items through the paint.It's fun enough kit. Unfortunately, since the container only includes ten sheets of paper, it's also a rather poor value."
2,I don't want to pity the characters....,"...but it seems like that is all there is left to do. I tore through the first two books in this series, but I am now left with a sense of continual pity and boredom with the characters. Are they are destined to be pummeled by Donaldson forever? Whereas I enjoy his concept of drama vs melodrama (in melodrama, you have a hero, the oppresed, and the oppressor; in drama you have the same characters but through the story they change their roles) the characters demonstrate their changes only through an ever increasing cruelty. While this can be interesting, it very soon becomes tedious and purposeless. 15 years after reading the ""Lena"" chapter of Lord Foul's Bane, I remember the scene vividly because it carried such a punch. In this book, the punches are numbing, and I fold. I've given up on the rest of the series and moved on."
3,Wonderful musicianship hampered by never improving vocals,"Lee has made a step in the right direction with this effort. He has left Big Blue behind and has no problems in holding his own. Apart from a very dodgy cover version of the Blondie song ""One Way Or Another"", he takes on some fine tunes.He spends more time with Rockabilly tunes than he has done since the Cats split. Only that wonderful intro. to ""Running From The Hounds"" on the first Phantom, Rocker & Slick album did anything for me. However, despite buying this simply because it is Stray Cat related, I cannot get excited about the standard of Lee's voice. This should get far less air time than the three Brian Setzer Orchestra albums."
3,Academic Murder,"It is difficult to write a mystery with a setting in academia without reverting to deadly stereotypes when campuses are their natural habitat. Andrew Greeley almost makes it with THE BISHOP GOES TO THE UNIVERSITY, but even his many skills fall short. A murder Russian priest who was teaching at the University of Chicago may have left trails to reach to the Vatican. Four people were in the building when the priest was shot, innocent by-standers or a killer in hiding?Father Blackie Ryan must deal with the police, agents from many counties and a romance that doesn't fit in this story. Somewhere in the mystery it just doesn't work. I'm not sure I can locate the flaw, but Blackie's wit and charm will keep his fans reading while waiting for the next installment.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Disappointing,"I have always looked forward to the Blackie Ryan books but I had a hard time getting through this one. The back story of the monk/priest/cardinal was just too convoluted and unbelievable, especially as it was inserted into the middle of the book as the priest's journal. By the time I was done with the ""journal"" I had a hard time remembering who the present-day characters were. And I never did understand why this was such a big deal that people were shot at and killed over it.Finally - I found the continuous involvement of characters from the ""Beggar Girl of Ste. Germaine"" annoying and unnecessary - just an advertisement to get people to read the earlier book."
1,"not good, bad disc error","worked for about a year without any problems... stopped in mid-play and then started reporting ""bad disc"" error. went out and bought a brand new one to replace the old one (after all, the first one lasted a year). The very first time we turned it on and put in a disc, it reported ""bad disc"" error... yes, we tried 10 different discs in both players... no good. Called tech support and (after arguing for 5 minutes that they DID NOT need my phone number and address to diagnose why my DVD doesn't play - I won) they said to return it to the store. No thanks, lesson learned. I really thought it would be OK to re-purchase because we had good luck apparantly with the first one."
1,The rule that proves the exception...,"Bottom line: I carried around a Craftsman folding rule for over 18 YEARS !! without a problem. Occasional oiling of the joints and keeping it clean was all I did. I finally dropped it off a roof and broke it in two. Sad day.I replaced it with a Lufkin and it wasn't in service for two weeks before the non-slide end snapped off at the hinge. Thinking this was possibly due to me somehow, I replaced it with another one from the same source. THIS one developed a loose joint (probable broken spring) within two months of purchase; I can twirl it around, no grab whatever.Whatever quality Lufkin may once have had, it appears to be gone now. I won't be buying any more, that's for sure. I'm hoping Craftsman still makes 'em the way they used to."
1,Lufkin rule,"An extension rule is the best for carpentry. I have one that is over 20 years old and works beautifully. Decided I needed another and bought 2 of these Lufkin rules. They looked fine but do not work. The metal extension sticks and must be forced to extend. You cannot get an accurate measurement if the slide does not move very smoothly. I have noticed that many tools no longer work. We seem to be in an era of ""looks like, but isn't.""Since Lufkin is willing to sell this terrible non-working product, I would beware of their other products."
4,Mine's appx. 50-60 years old and still going,"I have my father's well-used Lufkin folding rule and I still use it today - dings, loose extension, paint splatters, and all. There is no better tool for inside measurements. It does not break down like a tape measure (think of typical tape measure kinks from folding). It stays in place where you lay it, unlike a tape measure. The edges are flat, making precision measurements easier (precision here in the carpentry context, not engineering accuracy). It slides easily into a pocket or apron. It's still made pretty much the same way and to the same level of quality, and if I needed another one, I would still buy the Lufkin."
2,Don't waste your money,"If your work requires any degree of accuracy, this is not the rule for you. I purchase this rule for use at my table saw but straight out of the package it's a heavy 3/32 off, as compared to a Starrett 24 inch rule which I know is dead on. The only reason I gave it two stars, the joints seem solid."
2,FOUL BALL!,"John Massaro certainly has the personality to be a successfull umpire. To do the job you need to be independent and stand by your convictions without wavering...despite all sorts of abuse. His stereotyped views of women umpires and Hispanic ball players show just how little his ideas have wavered over his career. A shame. The war stories are typical of what you'll find in amateur ball and fellow umpires can't resist hearing (reading) them; although John proclaims far too often what a good umpire he was (despite admitting to some terrible deeds) and what shortcomings so many of his partners had. I was disappointed with the reading, but would be gladly work a ball game with him."
3,Good look at what went wrong during the Internet bubble,"Buy, Lie, and Sell High provides an interesting look at the Internet bubble and what caused it.It was a perfect storm of greedy people with little to no business experience, combined with unethical accounting firms, loose federal regulators, new technologies, and a hungry public looking to make a quick dollar.While the book has ?Enron? in the title, there is not a whole lot about Enron in the book, perhaps 10 pages.The book has a number of case studies of classic dot bombs. I am surprised that with all of the case studies, Mills did not discuss one of the biggest bombs, Value America.Overall, the book provides a good look at what went wrong and how it can be prevented from happening again."
2,"Interesting stories, but little analysis","I've recommended this book to a few people, but after reading it again recently I was left with a sense of ""so what?"" about it. As a professor it's hard to get students to understand the type of dreck that was put into the IPO market during the bubble, and this book has a lot of documentation in it, and some incredible but true war stories of the era. I will still recommend it, but I think that there are probably better accounts of the bubble out there, some of them in academic journals."
2,Confusing ...,"I agree with the user who said that the plot is hard to understand because of the editing. I'm not sure if the complete novela would have been easier to understand.Also, it's plenty corny."
3,Amor Real was GREAT-DVD WAS NOT!,I wish that this dvd was as good as the tv soap. The dvd did not have the same footage. Infact the dvd only had highlights that take away from this great novela. The tv soap is A++ but if you are looking for ALL the footage don't waste your time or money here!
2,This novela is not complete,"Don't buy this item if you are expecting to watch the entire novela. This novela is not a complete series, it sucks because I was expecting to watch it all but there is a lot of the novela that is cut out of. Fortunately it follows the story but for someone that has never watched it before it leaves you with a lot of questions. I gave it to someone for a gift and she kept on pausing the novela to ask questions."
2,una lastima,"Quede bastante descontenta con la edicion de la novela. La historia original estaba tan bien escrita y contada; en cambio la version en DVD es dificil entender y en partes no tiene mucho sentido. Es cierto que no pueden poner toda la novela en el DVD pero los cortes fueron tan drasticos que destruyeron la obra original, una verdadera lastima"
5,"""ONE OF THE BEST LOVE STORIES EVER""!!",I LOVE THE OLD WORLD MEXICO AND TO HAVE IT PORTRAY IN A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY WAS AMAZING. NOT TO MENTION THE GORGEOUS SCENES OF PAST MEXICO AND DON'T FORGET THE TALENT OF STARS..
1,Too Short to make sense,"I was fortunate enough to see Amor Real on Univision. It is a magnificate historial romantic novel. However, the DVD does it no justice. It runs from one event to the other without any background, it is just a series of previews. They are important characters that do not talk. Once you have seen the real thing this shortened version makes no sense. I was so disappointed that I cried. I would like to have all 95 episods so that I can view them for the rest of my life. The original was wonderful, the DVDs are disappointing. I do not know how anyone would understand it."
2,Disappointed,"I am so disappointed by the ""EDITED"" version of such a should be classic of the Telenovela ""Amor Real"". I saw the unedited version and that is why I purchased the dvd thinking it was so. You trashed the original version. This edited version takes out the wooing that the main character did and the courtship and going on of the female main character. It is ashame that who ever edited this version you took out such scenes that endeared me to this telenovela. I understand by reading some other reviews that this is common because of cost to the consumer but you and I know that is not true. Now that I know this is what happens to the telenovelas I am reluctant in purchasing more. Please let me know if you will sell the original unedited version."
3,it's alright,"This a good mexican soap opera, but I think that a lot of seens have been cut out and the story doesn't really have a smooth flow."
5,The best novela ever,"I was reading your reviews, and I will also like to know if this dvd has the complete soap opera. I will be really disappointed if not."
3,Run through,Its a very quick run through of episodes...too quick n short for my taste. You still see the story but I got dizzy at one point...wished they had the ENTIRE DVD.
2,Disappointed,I was confused. Jumped back and forth. Seems like it would have been an excellent Novela if I could have seen it in it's entirety.
3,not what i spected,"es una buena novela, pero lastimosamente no ponen todos los capitulos, demasiados cortes.yo vi esta novela cuando salio en tv y recuerdo muchas cosas que definitivamente no estan en estaos dvds, es una lastima que no la pongan completa."
1,Too bad,400 plus minutes for a soap opera? This soap opera aired with 3950 minutes. Nothing else needs to be said
5,amor real,i saw this in television but not yet i have not seeing everything i hope when i get it i could see it everything and i will when i saw it when it came out on television i turn off the television and i say to my self wait until it comes out in dvd so then i would buy it so i did. This is tony.
1,Completely disappointed!!!,Don't buy it! This edition completely destroys the soap opera story! It is a puzzle of very small scenes that turns the story into something incomprehensible. This is not a soap opera DVD. It is a movie trailler. Don't waste your money on it.
2,Real Love is Really Butchered,"Great costumes, scenery, writing, and over-the-top acting! Everything is in place for fabulous telenovela viewing experience, but the editing is brutal. After watching and thorougly enjoying ""Mi Destino Eres Tu"", my Spanish II students and I were primed to enjoy Amor Real. Unfortunatley, we had a near impossible time figuring out story lines, plot twists and new or minor characters.Why didn't the producers and editors use both discs (since it does come in a two-disc set) rather than only one to condense the 95 episodes? (I know, let's save a few bucks and ruin the product!) Bloopers are fun, but not at the expense of a coherent story line."
1,horrible,"This video does not do justice to the real show. It is chopped up totally! things are missing, points are missing, if you were seeing it for the first time you would not understand the movie as well as the story. They took a beautiful story and butchered it and moved through the story so fast!! it's horrible! I was very disapointed and do not recommend it to noone!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was so disappointed with the DVD version of this wonderful novela. They edited a 96-episode novela down to 1 double-sided disc. The second disc is basically Carla Estrada congratulating herself and the crew. They actually filmed the crewmembers being thanked for their work on the novela and ones who spoke, of course, thanked Carla Estrada. They showed bloopers and talked about the costumes. This is something that should have been a special feature on part on a disc. They should not have wasted two sides of a double DVD for this boring pat on the back for Carla Estrada. I don't understand why they couldn't have released the entire novela. Even if they had used both the double-sided discs for the novela the story wouldn't have been so chopping and confusing-even for someone who saw the novela on TV. I feel so cheated.Disc 1 chopped up novelaDisc 2 celebration of Carla Estrada/a few minutes of bloopersThe subtitles are only in English. Why not English and Spanish? ¿Por qué?"
1,Amor Real,In my opinion just two DVD in this beautiful story was to short. We lost 70% of the hole story. Baddddd very baddddd. It was a wasting.....
1,amor real,"I was under the impression that I would have the whole entire novela. Chapter 1 scene 1,2,3 ect. the video skipped a lot,I was not happy. Sorry"
1,Boring and bad acting,"I can't stand to watch more than 5 seconds of american soaps but after seeing two other awesome Spanish soaps, I got addicted to Rosalinda and Rubi. However, the ""Amor Real"" soap is boring and acting is so bad."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I purchased this novela because I saw the original and loved it. I was very disappointed with the DVD. All of the best parts were left out. The most enjoyable scenes were edited out. It left out the passion, the fights the love scenes, THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS. The second DVD was filled with nonsense, that space should have been used to tell the story. I don't understand how they could have turned such a wonderful story into such a disaster the person who edited this novela should be fired. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. It should be redone, I am so disappointed."
1,Amor Real,"La Novela Amor Real fue una novela hermosa, yo compre el DVD, porque mi esposo queria ver la novela, quedamos supremamente desilucionados de este DVD, las escenas estan cortadas increiblemente, se saltan de una escena a otra y si yo no hubiera visto la novela no hubiera entendido nada, la pusimos y solo la vimos por media hora, gaste la plata por gusto.Vamos a comprar el Vuelo de el Aguila, esperemos que no nos pase lo mismo.Tengo una pregunta: Como es posible que una productora y escritora de la categoria de Carla Estrada, permita que una produccion tan hermosa la destruyan de esa manera....:("
3,Its a nice story,Its amazing and i love the dresses and all the story is romantic but the cut is too much i hope they will make a less cut version or even put the compleet pack =)
1,No hay Novela,"Esta tan mal cortada la novela que la resumen en 1 dvd por ambos lados, no se entiende es un desastre"
5,"Beethoven: Symphony No. 9; Claudio Abbado, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra","Beethoven: Symphony No. 9; Claudio Abbado, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is a very fine recording under the direction of Claudio Abbado who leads the Wiener Philharmoniker on this Deutsche Grammophon recording from 1987. Robert Simpson has written the liner-notes in English. The sound is astounding and this is something one expects from Deutsche Grammophon. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,A classic,"A very good live performance from Abbado's first complete cycle. His Beethoven was still traditional, his last recordings are faster and clearly influenced by the new historicaly informed approach. The recorded sound is good,but not very refined."
4,Good performance nonetheless...,"Abbado is certainly one of the ""ideal"" Beethovenian conductors since Karajan, and has done Beethoven pretty frequently, including three recorded performances of Beethoven's timeless Ninth Symphony.Of the three recordings he did, this is the first one (Vienna Philharmonic DG) he did, ... and the least impressive. It's a good performance nonetheless, the tempi and the singers and all, but a bit lacks the intensity and clarity in the two recordings (Berlin Philharmonic Sony and Berlin Philharmonic DG) the Maestro would do even better.I highly recommend the Sony recording. That one should be a legend!"
5,An amazing story in an amazing time,What an amazing story! From the first word to the last I was lost in this book. I found myself wishing that I lived in such an amazing time in Idaho's history! A must read!
5,Great Read!!,"I bought this book along with two others about two weeks ago. I was most excited to read Love in the Driest Season so naturally, I read this first. I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't put it down. This is a story is a true example of unconditional love. Tucker did an amazing job of articulation just what he was feeling and what was, and is going on in Africa. In all honesty, the level of graphic detail caught me off guard, but it definitely made the book that much better. It is such a sweet, heartfelt book. If more dads loved their daughters the way Neely adores Chipo, the world would be a much brighter place. Great book and a must read!"
3,Love in the Driest Season,"""Love in the Driest Season"" is worth reading just to get a glimpse of what a foreign correspondent's live is like: full of long plane rides, gloomy hotel rooms, risky situations, and thankless assignments. But the real story concerns the difficulties Neeley Tucker and his African American wife experience trying to adopt a vulnerable baby, one that they tended day and night to save from death. What I found fascinating was the shameless tactics used by office functionaries to drag their feet to block the adoption. We lost the file, you're in the wrong office, so-and-so- isn't coming in today, etc. etc. Hundreds of babies languish in orphanages but the policy was not to adopt to foreigners, especially a white man. An impatient, always on-the-go guy learns how to sit for hours in stark waiting rooms in relentless attempts to push the system towards adoption of a child he loves as his own. While not the greatest book, it is an amazing story!"
3,Average,The description was better than the book. It wasn't at all compelling and I found it difficult to finish reading.
4,Heartwreching and Inspiring,"Love in the Driest Season is by no means an easy read, but well worth the effort. At times it drags, yet it quickly returns to the heart of the story - Chipo. Tucker's descriptions of the conditions in sub-Saharan Africa are heartbreaking and often difficult to process, yet they shed light on the severity of the AIDS epidemic that is still so prevelent. Chipo's story is inspiring, and the crux of this memoir, yet you can easily grasp the bigger picture that Tucker paints into the book. Kudos to the Tuckers for their indefatigable efforts on behalf of Chipo, and shame on the Mugabe government for refusing to accept the help offered in such trying times, especially where orphaned children are concerned."
4,The Lengths To Save A Child,"Neely Tucker's story of how he and his wife came to adopt an ailing African child proves the adage that the heart knows no boundries.The book works so sucessfully on three distinct levels:-Race and prejudice both in the United States and in Africa.-The mounting tension and political termoil gripping the AIDS ravaged country.-And most prominantly as a simple love story between a girl and her caretakers, and what they will undertake to save her.A moving, exhausting, yet exhilarating book."
5,"Powerful story, incredible writing","Neely Tucker is an amazing writer. I was absolutely blown away by the power in his words. I have read many articles he has written, but was not prepared for the talent and amazing writing style of this memoir. This book has so many levels of excellence- emotion, very great reporting and historical information, very intimate details of his life, and just plain riveting. I read this book in one day. I literally couldn't tear myself away from it, even though I already knew the outcome of the story.I wish this book was more well known, especially in light of all the events happening to children all over Africa today. A must read. HIGHLY recommended!"
4,Xmas gift for son,"He likes it. He is an avid Stehpen King fan, and we both read all of his books. I am planning to read it also."
4,Guides,"Reference guides such as this are like icing for collectors. They allow you to explore another's interpretation of a place you visited inside your own imagination.The Gunslinger, The Way Station, the Oracle and the Mountains, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man (The Dark Tower)"
5,Bout Time Do You Know How Long I Waited!!!!,"Man, I waited forever for this cd. I thought it was coming out in May but it didn't. I wasn't going to stop looking for it though. I just happened to look here and there it was. It needs more promotion on it because you won't find it unless you're like me and have been looking for it for about 2-3 months. It was worth the wait and hopefully these guys will be around the Colorado area again because they definately have a fan in me. Stay hot and keep up the good work and you'll go far Wylde Bunch!!!"
5,Hard to surpass this version,"Brahms wrote this set of short pieces for amateur singers to use at home. Most modern recordings use a choir. Nothing wrong with that but this version is probably closer to the original intent. Here we have a major pianist and a major conductor and chamber musician playing the four-hand piano part accompanying Soprano Edith Mathis, Mezzo Brigitte Fassbender, Tenor Peter Schrier and Baritone Deitrich Fischer-Dieskau...a pretty high powered combination. Since all the ""players"" are German speaking natives there is no question that the text will be meaningfully expressed through the music. The only possible caveat is that Fischer-Dieskau is captured in his vocal decline which gives him a bit of a huffy quality to his singing. Buit we live in an imperfect world, don't we?"
3,An all-star cast but lacking in charm,"The reviewer below has gone overboard about this starry recording. Despite the presence of Peter Schreier and Fischer-Dieskau, the male side of the quartet lacks charm, and although Fassbainder and Mathis make up for that, I didn't find myself smiling very often. This is supposed to be joyous music, the epitome of friends gathered around the parlor piano. Here it sounds like professional singers reading a score, very well to be sure, but without much love, which is the theme of these dances. I'll stick with the Marlboro recording on Sony and the historic EMI set that features the incomparable Dinu Lipati and Nadia Boulanger as pianists."
5,A regency that resonates with the modern reader,"The heroine has found inner peace and contentment after working through difficult issues of betrayal and innocence. A strangely resonating novel: lucky the woman who dares to open her heart to love, and as it opens, finds the handsome rake of her dreams ready to love her too!"
5,A masterpiece,"In most historical romances, a heroine has courage only if she fights like a man or can spar with the hero uselessly.Indiscreet is one of the few books where a heroine's courage is not defined by the above mentioned qualities but her belief in her honor and the decisions she makes.Some great writing by Mary Balogh particularly when Catherine narrates her past to Rex. A book which truly makes you feel for its characters."
1,THE FAKE LIVE RECORDING!,"If you ever listen closly to this ""live"" recording, you can hear the same applause after each song. There are some dead giveaways, such as a distant banging sound followed by feedback and each time you can hear it with the same yelling and applause. Just bad stuff Fantasy!I've heard that the rehersal tapes (for that very tour of Europe) were used, then some crowd noise was added to the mix. As rehersals go, they aren't bad performances, but the mix is muddy. I've long since sold my copy.A better live album to buy from this time period is, MADE IN JAPAN by Deep Purple. No overdubs, no fake crowd, just good live music!"
3,Not her best...,"Okay, I'm the first to raise my hand and declare, ""I'm a Dee Henderson Addict!"", but this book just didn't thrill me. It wasn't until I was done reading it and was thinking, ""blah..."" that I realized this book was her FIRST book. Then, everything made sense. Her writing, character development, dialogue...everything has improved over the years. I then re-read the book with a more compassionate eye. It's still not up to snuff of the ""O'Malley Series"" or the ""Uncommon Heroes"" series, but for a first attempt, it was good. Again, if you're going to be reading ""The Marriage Wish"" thinking it was on par with her other books, you might be surprised (like me). But, if you read it and realize its significance in the literary process of Ms. Henderson, it's pretty good."
4,Be careful what you wish for........,"How often do we make wishes and fail to recognize what we really want? Scott knows from the minute he sees Jennifer, and works hard at following God's will instead of his own when it comes to the desires of his heart. Dee Henderson is a excellent author and each of her stories puts you right there with what her characters are going through. She captures the realness of life and translates that to words that make it difficult to put her books down! Read all her stuff, you won't be disapointed!"
4,The Marriage Wish,I enjoyed this book. I also like the biblical references and would recommend this book/author and would read her other projects.
3,"Good Story Line, But Wanting","Dee Henderson chooses a great title in THE MARRIAGE WISH, for Scott Williams desires nothing more than to wed author, Jennifer St. James. Enter conflict: Grieving her late husband and daughter, Jennifer is terrified to commit to a new family.Henderson paces the plot effectively, stringing the reader along until finally after much fear and indecision, Jennifer says, ""yes"" to Scott's marriage proposal.While the book delivers a solid story line, there is much lacking in the execution: dialogue that goes nowhere, needless repetition, and head-hopping within the same scene. Furthermore, I find Scott's character a bit unrealistic at times--too good to be true.Nevertheless, if you enjoy romance, THE MARRIAGE WISH is a story worth reading, especially for the thorough job Henderson does helping the characters through grief and loss. -Eileen Rife, author of WHEN MOURNING COMES, LIVING THROUGH LOSSWhen Mourning Comes: Living Through Loss"
1,Didn't Cut,Was very disappointed in this product. Got a tip from a blogger that this would cut like butter through metal scrapbooking dies....it didn't!!!!
5,Great tool - low price,These snips work perfectly. Don't let the low price fool you. Wiss has been making them forever and they are truly the best.
5,"high quality, sturdy","This thing is good quality and sturdy. It cuts metal sheets like paper. Very sharp and once you get a hang of it, you can really get some good cutting precision. FOr less than $20, this is worth every penny."
4,"Season is great, but flaw on disc 2","My copy of Coach Season 4 had a problem with disc 2. One of the episodes would not play. It was the one in which Dauber moves into Luther's building and there is some kind of ruckus. I returned my Season 4 set to Amazon and they gave me a replacement copy. The replacement copy had the exact same problem. Amazon offered me a refund.Aside from the aforementioned problem the season is pretty good. There were some very enjoyable moments on the other episodes. Overall I think you will like this season. One day I will buy it again, perhaps when they make the next printing/pressing of the DVD's.Did anybody else have a problem with their Disc 2?"
5,HOT DAMN!,"I first saw Matt Hole and the Hot Rod Gang at Wacky's in San Antonio, ever since that show my musical preference has been changed drastically. I was a hardcore punk, but after seein them play, I now apreciate Rockabilly as much as a greaser. I let my brother bring this c.d. to a party, and now about a billion people know the words to ""We're From Texas"", and on every chorus of the song, everyone lets out a healthy, ""yeehaw!"". If you ever have a chance to see them live, go at all costs. If you're a yankee devil and you live up north, just buy the album. It should convince you to move down south."
3,Visual Intimacy and Vulnerability,"Iterating scenes of visual intimacy, Siri Hustvedt's first novel THE BLINDFOLD (1992) comprises a series of four interconnected accounts of several years of graduate study in literature at Columbia University in the 1980s, told through the eyes of a Midwesterner in her 20s and new to the cruelty, darkness and pollution of New York City. She struggles with poverty, hunger, sexual desire, neurological disorder, gender role conflict, identity fragmentation and madness. There are black holes in her perceptual field through which evil achieves an opening, and which feed her fascination with knowing the tactile world, listening, and finding the right words. Fearing that she may become a footnote in a psychiatric case history, the narrator is on a path to becoming a published writer. Hustvedt details how it feels to be the object and the subject of erotic encounters that border on the uncanny. In this novel, being seen is a form of vulnerability."
2,Forgettable,"Would this book have been published at all, had Siri Hustvedt not been married to Paul Auster, another completely overrated author?It's completely forgettable. Go read that great 80s author Brett Easton Ellis instead."
4,A French reader from Ireland,I had never heard of Hustvedt existence before studying Auster for my Master's degree. I did not know at the time whether i would like her or not but it was enthralling so just give it a go and you will discover that she deserves a bigger audience.
5,Excellent Information,"My wife and I are thinking of visiting Thailand, and a friend recommended we read this book. After reading the book, I would love to move there! It is obvious that Hein has spent a great amount of time in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. His writing skill is excellent and keeps the reader interested and entertained at the same time.The book is chock-full of practical information (e.g. where you can teach English, who to contact for an apartment, local hospitals, etc...). In addition, the book also offers many vignettes of the friendliness of the Thai people, customs to be aware of, and how to get around the city.Although the author stresses that the book is mainly for people that plan on living in Bangkok, I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in visiting, or even just knowing a little bit more about the city."
5,"An excellent, and rare, assembler reference","Assembler reference books are hard-to-find these days, much less good ones. This is a superb, detailed, and very thorough reference. This book presents, in good depth, a vast array of important programming issues that are not even mentioned in most other Assembler books (if you can even find one!). Highly recommended."
1,The best reference for S390 assembler programming available!,"Don't let the ""Advanced"" in the title throw you.This book is a great guide for anyone doing IBM S90assembler programming. I find it frequently to be a betterquick reference than manuals provided by IBM. An addedbonus is that the author has provided all the source codein the book on the public domain CBT tape and throughNASPA on their annual CD-rom (http://www.nascom.com) whichmakes using the techniques shown even easier.Sam Knutson, S390 Developer, Landmark Systems Corporation"
5,Love the Fox 40,I purchased this whistle for officiating high school swim meets. I really like how loud it is. It can be used to quiet down a pool full of hundreds of swimmers and spectators without any problems. I highly recommend this whistle.
2,not good for school teacher -,not loud enough! sounds silly.... not a real whistle. I had to get another metal one but the color was cute.
4,its a whistle,its the same as any other whistle you get. it does get very loud and does have good accents. GOod Stuff
5,it's a whistle,bought this for volleyball coaching/reffing. Works like a whistle. You blow into it and it is loud. it was pretty cheap too.
5,The Best Whistle Ever Made!!!!,"I can't belive how loud this whistle is. As a football referee, I am contantly in need of a whistle that will be loud and dependable. The Fox40 does just that!johntsimon@msn.com"
1,An Airmobile Platoon Leader?,"This book is about a typical desk jockey, who spent his entire tour in 'Nam trying to get out of the field. He whined whenever he didn't get his way, or had to sleep out in the bush, with his unit. WAHHH . And then, finally, he gets ""wounded"", when a tree fell on him! Well, he just loves wearing the big yellow patch on his right sleeve, but he far from earned it. Officers like him (are you listening Lt. Robinson!) are the reason I only spent 3 years in the Army, after joining and intending to make it a career. If I could give it no stars, or even negative stars, I would. Save your money."
1,A movie about people cleaning weapons,"I rented this, thinking it would be a cool super hero movie. Not! Instead, i got a poorly plotted cartoon that essentially involved shoot outs, wedged in between scenes of heroes cleaning their weapons in a studio apartment. Everytime the director needed a transition scene, he'd send everybody back to the apartment to clean and polish their guns and knives. A film made for the fast foward button."
3,second opinion,"I want to respond to the amazon.com editorialist, David Hurwitz's, opinion. I own a complete Claudio Abbado Beethoven cycle, and it is hardly ideal, but among his peers there is no equal and I'm sick of critics recommending Leonard Bernstein recordings of any kind for any reason! Bernstein missed his calling with the Boston Pops. Karajan did some good stuff, but I wouldn't ever recommend his Beethoven. Karajan was from a well established Salzburg family and thats exactly how he conducts Beethoven. As for Karl Boehm, I'd recommend the Pastoral which has been newly remastered by DG. As far as Abbado's Beethoven goes, it is closer to the powerful spirit of Furtwangler's vision than any other serious conductor today. There is an elitist notion that if you are Italian, you are disqualified from conducting Beethoven. If you are looking for a more recent ""faithful"" Beethoven, try Gardiner's Missa Solemnis."
5,Clippers,This product was a gift for Christmas and the recipient thought it was great and in perfect condition. Thank you.
4,Straight cut,"It does a nice straight cut. There is a little problem, there isn't enough curve in the snip to get the material out of the way of the next cut. It kinda fights you."
4,I liked it,I liked it because it has a lot of things to learn from in it. I didnot find it entertaining but the things it covers are good.
1,keep your money,"I love chess books ... I devour them. This one made me nauseous. I got flashbacks of kindergarten when my teacher would make me do busy work while she bemoans ""What could have been ..."". Keep your money, or you will regret spending the $20. ""How to Reassess Your Chess"" by Jeremy Silman is much much better, and it is cheaper too.And no ... I am not Jeremy Silman nor do I know him :-)Keep your money. Buy your special someone some flowers or candy. Give it to some homeless person if you want. Better yet, buy some other chess book like the old standy ""My System"" by Nimzovich or games collections of Capablanca, Alekhine, Tal, etc.Oh by the way, I have a sneaking suspicion that the other reviewers may have gotten kick-backs from one or more of the authors :-)"
4,Charming covers,"These covers are very nice. I bought a set for my mom and they made her very happy. I am getting her another set because she ""cooked"" one while cleaning her stove dials. You can't go wrong for the money."
3,Reference and Information Services: An Introduction,"Bopp and Smith give a clear introduction and still relevant overview of the day-to-day responsibilities and issues regarding Reference Librarians (2010); although this 3rd ed. was published in 2001). The text, as is the case with most Library Science textbooks, contains a enough bibliographic information to keep Library and Information Science Ph.D. researchers busy for the next several hundred years. Be sure to read the section on Job Stress and Organizational Responses p. 230-234. Reference and Information Services is a useful textbook and quick reference. Julian, MBA and MLS (in progress)"
1,Reference and Information Services: An Introduction,I used this book for a reference class in the Fall of 2006. It is completely outdated. I actually gave up reading the textbook for the class. The professor finally agreed to change the textbook for the class but a semester too late for me. So if you are looking for a good resource to assist you in giving good reference help...keep on looking!
4,"Great, but already needs an update!","This is a great book for learning about reference philosophy, sources, and services. Its one weakness is its lack of coverage of virtual (chat) reference. It briefly mentions ""videoconferencing,"" but with the importance of chat/IM today, along with e-mail, phone, and in-person forms of communication, the reference librarian needs to know how virtual reference systems work and how to implement them. One book about virtual reference that could supplement this text is ""Going Live: Starting and Running a Virtual Reference Service,"" published by the ALA. Also, its chapter on instruction could be rewritten with greater clarity. Otherwise, an outstanding text."
2,There are better books like this....,"I am a library and information science student, and this was a required text for a class. It is not a poorly written book, but it is very dry to read, and there are alternatives. Introduction to Reference Service in the Digital Age and Reference and Information Services in the 21st century are good alternatives, I especially liked Intro to Reference Service because it wasn't unbearable to read."
4,"Well, it's a textbook...","...so it's not all that exciting. It was required, so I didn't really have much of a choice. I'm sure as I move through the School of Library Science, I might find other, more informative texts on reference. I do like that this text gives you numerous examples of the various types of sources and a search strategy, like almanacs, databases, and atlases, and which ones seem most useful for a given audience. The most useful stuff has been on the specific sources."
3,A good reference textbook,"Provides plenty of detailed information that is helpful for those interested in library reference; does NOT keep you up late at night, wondering how it ends."
3,Five stars until the end,"I agree that this is a wonerful Mahler Fourth, for all the reasons already given. But it wasn't right to have a boy soprano sing the last movement. If Mahler had wanted an uncultivated voice, he would have asked for one--the Third Sym. has children sisnging in the fourth movement. Here he wanted the sophisticated effect of faux-naive, a woman singing to evoke a child's vision of heaven. An actual child is too artless to convey this effect--the boy soprano here simply sounds like he's struggling to get all the notes out on pitch without losing energy."
2,Don't believe it,"In a word or two, this CD is a semi-turkey. It has moderately good sonics, nothing special. I put this comment first (even though it is the least important thing about this recording) because it is by far the most favorable thing I'm going to say. Bernstein sounds totally at sea here, sometimes directing what seems to be random wandering by the Concertgebouw when he loses the line of the symphony's development. The vocal part, sung with empathy, is one of the great vocal moments of the entire literature. It *can* melt titanium, but Helmut Wittek is either off key or has a very unsympathetic mixdown. He is unmoved by the score besides, to judge by the unpersuasive result. I really love this symphony; get the Szell/Cleveland/Raskin (or even the 1960 Bernstein/NY Phil/Grist) version and do yourself a favor. Even those who are willing to have more than one Mahler #4 don't want this one."
4,Not Your Typical Bernstein Interpretation,"For Mahlers most simple and light hearted symphony Bernstein thorws out all the excessive interpretation he is notorious for and plays this as the beautiful music that it is. Throughout the first movement he condusts the Concergebouw Orchestra in relaxed style which is refreshing compared with the intense treatment he gives the other Mahler symphonies. Instead of layers upon layers of interpretation we hear the true music and discover its simple yet powerful beauty. He doesn't quite sustain this through the rest of the symphony; occasionally he'll force the music a little, but he never goes to extremes or push the music to its limits as he attempts in his other Mahler recordings. For the most part he stays comfortably in the middle and lets the music shine through. Especially interesting is the use of a boy soprano in the final movement. The innocence of it makes this a truly beautiful experience."
5,Bernstein - Mahler : A winner.....,"Mahler's 4th is not really a ""Mahlerian"" symphony. Full of joy and hope... Lenny, being the greatest Mahlerian of all times see through the notes and delivers one of the best accounts available. The interpretation of Helmut Wittek in the Sehr behaglich is indeed unconvensional but it underlines the emotion the symphony induces... A great interpratation along with these of Rattle for EMI, Szell for Sony and Boulez for DG."
3,Good as a curiosity.,"Despite great playing from the Concertgebouw orchestra,this is an anecdotical recording just good as a curiosity.It was never intended from the composer to be sung by a boysoprano, so the result is a bit of bizarre. For a reallygreat 4th by Lenny, just go for the earlier SONY recordingwith NYPO."
2,mis- represented,product was supposed to have a timing tab..i paid 22 dollars for an eighteen dollar item even after contacting customer service..........i'm disappointed but not to where i'll never order again...i've ordered several items since and they were right
5,Only tape I own!,"There are a lot of companies out there that make tape measures.I think I've used just about all of them! And they all have thier pros and cons. Lufkin itself makes dozens of types of tapes. It is this tape that has served me the best. It fits the hand great for a 25 footer (I have small hands). It locks down tight so the blade doesn't move, unlike most other tapes. The lockdown button is high and easy to reach. Standard 3"" case for easy measurements. Standard markings on the blade. I've used this tape for over 20 years and will never switch. It works and does what it's suppossed to do. I own 5 of these! Remember that this Lufkin tape is the one to buy out of the rest of their line. The label on the tape says #2125. Get that one! Amazon comes through again!"
2,New Maverick too slow,"James Garner is one of the best actors of our time,and he is the only part of this show worth watching. It drags on forever. Not much thought went into making this show. If you like westerns with a slow plot then you would like this one."
1,The Original Maverick,"I totally agree that it is the Original Maverick TV Show that people want, especially the ones starring James Garner.David N."
4,Any Garner Maverick on DVD is Appreciated,What a joy it was to see James Garner return to the role that made him famous! The character has aged like fine wine and the sharp Garner tongue is still firmly planted in the cheek. I agree only in part with the other reviewers - we do want to see the original Maverick on DVD! But this will serve as a nice appetizer until the main course comes along. And personally I can't see reviewing a product that you have not bothered to take the time to watch.
3,The New Maverick,"This TV flick was filmed a the Old Tucson Studio's in Tucson, AZ. I was the Location Manager on this film and we had lots of fun making it. It wasn't the best MOW ever filmed but it was entertaining and interesting to watch. I would recommend it, not because I was involved, but because it is a fun movie to watch.Jack Young"
3,Where is the director's cut?,"When this show was released on VHS in 1994 it was a ""Director's Cut"". which had added scenes and was 110 minutes in length. The version released on DVD is only 92 minutes long. Couldn't Warner Brothers have at least released the longer version of this show?"
4,Pretty Good MAVERICK for Fans,"I'd never seen this TV-movie pilot for THE NEW MAVERICK television series -- a series which ABC decided not to put on their schedule back in 1978. It was to introduce a younger Maverick cousin named Ben -- which is what CBS did a year later with the short-lived YOUNG MAVERICK.But James Garner is really the star here, and his old TV series partner Jack Kelly as Brother Bart makes a welcome appearance, too. The movie was written by veteran ROCKFORD FILES writer-producer Juanita Bartlett.So, if you're a fan of either the original MAVERICK (soon to be available on DVD) or the 1981 BRET MAVERICK series, you're likely to enjoy this genial episode. Garner is charming as ever, and it's always a pleasure seeing him playing this character."
4,Good show,"I enjoyed this DVD. Always enjoy Jim Garner.I had purchased the original Maverick complete series through a link to TV Ruby on Amazon, since Amazon didn't have it. I was disappointed with that box set because 9 of 25 disks were unusable. Some episodes were duplicated, and one disk was for the Practice instead of Maverick. The quality of TV Ruby's shows was often poor. Also, none of the disks were usable after the first viewing. They have not responded to my complaints. So don't use TV Ruby if you want a good product."
1,WHY? WARNERS BROTHERS. WHY?,I admit I have never seen this TV movie.My low marks for this product is aim at Warner Home Video. BOO! HISS!Why are they releasing this DVD?They should be releasing season sets for the original MAVERICK TV Series.That is the Show that the people want.That is the Show that the People Love.
4,Useful attachment,"I have an Oregon 550t. As it came, as I moved, the gps unit would come down about 4 inches and would be so annoying.I just discovered that if you tie a knot further up the cord that the retraction force is higher. As I move now, the gps stays tight to the unit. YAY!!!I just wish I discovered this before I spent more money on other alternatives that had the same problem, only worse! Now I'm trying the same solution on those. Maybe I'll end up with a bunch of usable retractable lanyards.I geocache. This is perfect for me since I'm usually the navigator, not driver. When I get out, I pull it out far enough to read it and then when the cache is found, then I just let it go and it zips back. No setting the gps down and then accidently leaving it, etc."
3,Getting Started Making Wire Jewelry,"Good for techniques but to me the designs are not attractive.....To each his/her own I guess.""grannyvette"""
4,Great beginner book,"A pretty book with clear instructions about wire jewelry basics. If you are beyond entry level in this art form, then this book may be a little too simple for you. It has some pretty designs, but most of the information is available for free on the web. Some of the photographs are of slightly more embelished works than explained in the text, so check the supplies carefully if you want to make what is photgraphed."
2,Too basic for anyone with slight experience,"I was very disappointed with this book. It had a few basic steps, but they were limited and the designs offered were not ones I would ever make for me or friends. The best part of the book was the first chapter on materials and tools. There are better beginning books (Bead on a wire) with more tips and design ideas than this. I sent mine back!"
4,The Peaks and Pitfalls of Ayn Rand's Philosphy,"Ayn Rand's philosphy is correct, and beautiful, if you will, in that it speaks for the indivdual and for self-motivation. It also speaks against all principles which I identify as Communism, Socialism and Dictatorships, all of which I hate with a passion. However, in standing up for the indivdual, she also speaks for selfishness, which, like the power if Socialism, corrupts anyone, brings them to hatred in the eyes of peers and in the eyes of many religions. More than anything, though, Ayn Rand's For the New Intellectual makes you think, and you come up with your own profound philosphy on ego and the indivdual, a philosphy which will touch your life deeply, and hopefully, the lives, the souls, around you."
1,"Dire, vacuous and bitter.","This book is a compression of Rand's philosophy with chunks taken from her other works. It achieves its goal in terms of providing a summary of her ""philsophical"" work, but on the down-side it quickly becomes apparent that she has little to offer. Her understanding of Western philosophy is surprisingly poor - she adores Aristotle and loathes Plato and seems to miss many of the similarities between the two. Worse, her metaphysical claims are the very worst of amateur philosophizing.If you're serious about addressing libertarianism at its best, I recommend you read someone like Nozick instead. He offers intelligent, often compelling arguments for a minimal state, while Rand simply offers slogans, dogma and resentment."
5,Choking from the Smoke is a liar,"Choking from the Smoke is a lying second-hander, parasite, looter, value-destroyer, and hater of the good for being the good. Ayn Rand discovered and integrated the ONLY COMPLETELY TRUE AND RATIONAL PHILOSOPHY. We who agree with her are not 'cultists' but are RATIONALLY PERSUADED that she was RIGHT - because she WAS, and to deny it is to deny reality. Those who disagree are merely revealing themselves as the subhuman wretches that they are. These lice who evade reason and reality have FREELY CHOSEN the premises of DEATH - and when the principles of Ayn Rand are put into practice, they will be put out of their misery as they so richly deserve and WANT.Anyone who wants to work for that future can LIVE IN IT TODAY by reading the works of the greatest genius who ever lived: Ayn Rand. This book is a good introduction to her thought.Fight for the DEATH of the looters!In the name of the best within us!"
1,There IS NO other kind of Objectivism.,"The 'sickening mess' of which some complain is the DIRECT result of books like this one. Rand herself fostered the 'cult' mentality and it is woven into the very fabric of her 'philosophy'. This volume is a very good example: she presents a 'history' of philosophy in which she classifies every major thinker other than herself and Aristotle as either an 'Attila' or a 'Witch Doctor'. There have, in Randworld, been just two philosophers in all of history who were not out to destroy the human mind, and Rand is the only one who got things altogether right. The ENTIRE purpose of this propagandistic little book, and of the 'Objectivist' movement itself, is to create a class of New Intellectuals who unreservedly agree with this assessment and will act to keep the One True Philosophy from being compromised while the rest of the world hurtles to its death a la ATLAS SHRUGGED. So if you think there's some other way to be an 'Objectivist' - check your premises."
1,Poor parodies prove negative reviews,"The poor parody, ""Don't dare read this!"", just confirms what the negative reviewers are saying. Whoever submitted this review clearly didn't *read* the negative reviews very well, because quite a few of them *do* seem to have read the book.And just in case this reviewer is actually *serious* - no, you're not entitled to such a negative opinion unless you've actually read the book."
5,A great new perspective of dominant ideologies,"The first half of For the New Intellectual is a detailed non-fiction essay explaining past and current ideologies in terms of ""mystics of muscle"", aka ""Attilas"", and ""mystics of the mind"", aka ""witch doctors"". These basically translate into those who want to control what people *do* such as dictators, and those who want to control what people *believe* such as religious leaders. The essay goes into detail explaining their dependency on both each other and their victims. Perhaps most importantly it explains how not to be a victim.The second half of the book illustrates many of the principles described in the first half through excerpts from Ayn Rand's fictional works We The Living, Anthem, The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged. WARNING: There are plot spoilers in the excerpts."
2,Same old Ayn Rand rants,"Way too wordy, poor writing skills, repeats same thing endlessly, quotes herself (as in ""John Galt says ...""). I couldn't finish it. Atlas Shrugged was same thing: I had to skip many many pages to get past a rant. No way would anyone put up with listening to a speech (by John Galt in Atlas Shrugged) that goes for 100 pages. Yet she repeats the entire 100 page speech. Totally unrealistic. She is a genius about philosophy, but I can't follow her most of the time."
1,Fantasyland for an isolated ego.,"Yes, this is indeed Ayn Rand's worldview in a nutshell. Read this and you won't have to wade through any of her stupefyingly boring novels. Read this little book and you'll get to spend time in Rand's fantasyland of isolated egos, a world that resembles a godless mathematical machine made of flint in which humans only ""deserve"" to exist if they can meet the Darwinian demands of Supply and Demand. This book, like much of what Ayn Rand wrote during her benzedrine-driven career, provides the perfect excuses for every egomaniac banker on Wall Street who wants to grab all the loot they can get their hands on and pillage every retirement account that comes their way. For Rand and her followers, ""deregulation of the market"" has been a mantra they have all chanted these past ten years while they legally bled the country dry, fair and square."
2,Skip it; try P:WNI,"Boy, I stay away from these pages for a while and look what happens. My old review is buried somewhere under ""click here for all customer comments,"" so here's another -- a short one.Skip this book; the main essay is mostly polemic, and the excerpts from Rand's novels are available in the novels, where they belong. If you want a fairly good introduction to Ayn Rand, try _Philosophy: Who Needs It_ (but see my review there for warnings). As for the philosophy itself, Objectivism doesn't present a coherent philosophical outlook anyway, so never mind who is and isn't a true ""Objectivist."""
1,The basic message of Ayn Rand,Here's the basic message of Ayn Rand:Run like hell from anybody who expects you to be nice. Then you will somehow be suited for life in a truly human society.What rot.
1,One of the best cases for the abolition of western civlizati,"Rand spews more of her worthless, destructive selfishness which is already quite rampant in this world. I find it hard to take her seriously while she attempts to promote the individual while she has founded yet another ""-ism"" to define people by."
1,Mat,"Anyone who starts their review of this foul book by saying that it is ""one of the best philosophical books I've read"" obviously hasn't read enough philosophical books.Ayn Rand is the Ann Coulter of the 1960's; The ""new intellectual"" she praises in the title is actually her romanticized ""Businessman,"" or he who applies his mind only to the creation of profit for himself and thus security for his family and ideas. She essentially argues that any effort that does not contribute directly to a free-market economy is counter productive. A truly ugly set of ideas."
4,An introduction...,"As introductions go, this was fair. The book is a compilation of an essay and excerpts from Rand's fiction. Her philosophy of Objectivism, developed somewhat in her fiction, is obviously in its infancy in this essay. But the pure nature of it is visible.If you are unsure about Rand and picked up one of her books and were a bit overwhelmed at its depth, this is a good place to skim the surface and get a sampling of her fiction and her non-fiction work that followed."
5,Lots of fun well done.,"I really enjoy this movie. It was well done and suitable for the entire family. (Check out the background antics on the roof when he rides into town.) It isn't a 'great' movie, but it is one to watch to cheer you up and have a vacation from mundane life."
5,Where was this ....,I love James Purefoy and he was extremely cute in this part. Michael Clark Duncan was very good in his role. This is a cute film and I recommend it to anyone looking for a clean family film.
5,A Wonderful Family Fantasy Movie,"I am a grandfather, and I watched this movie with my three-year-old grandson, and we both really enjoyed the movie. I found nothing in this movie that would be questionable for children. Some might think the big fight near the end would be too violent for kids, but this grandson clearly understood that the bad guys were being beaten. I have to say 'beaten' because I don't recall the movie showing anyone being killed. Even when the priest was struck, and 'blood' gushed out, it turned out to be his secret wineskin that was cut! Then, even though the movie didn't show it actually happen, my grandson figured out that the dragon had eaten the final bad guy! While, the movie was simple enough for a preschool boy to understand, it was entertaining enough for his grandpa to enjoy it as well. And, Grandma, walking in and out of the room, said she wanted to watch it when she had time! This is a very enjoyable family fantasy movie."
3,Entertaining in a goofy sort of way,"OK, this is not what you'd call highbrow, or realistic, or historically factual or anything, but if you are in the mood for some light entertainment grab some popcorn, kick back and enjoy a few laughs while you watch this movie that kind of turns the St. George and the Dragon legend on its ear. Never liked the legend anyway since I've always rooted for the dragon so maybe that's why I kind of liked this movie. I gave it 3 stars which is how I rate a movie that entertained me but that I'll probably never watch again. Good to put in your ""queue"" for a lazy day."
1,"Ummm, No.","If a film can make me cringe every time Patrick Swayze walks into a scene, nuff said, that is just not supposed to happen."
3,It was ok,"It had a good cast and acting was well done. Had great cameos. It had a interesting storyline, some parts reminded me of Robin Hood Prince of Theives. Was hoping to have more humor than what it did. The CGI was ok, not the best but not the worst I've seen. It's work a watch."
5,Excellent. What I expected!,What I ordered was what I expected.Excellent in every way. ALL. Thanks AMAZON!
3,Not Quite Forever,"The Eco-drive doesn't quite last forever. I've had mine 3 years and it is giving trouble. I don't keep it on my wrist at night and I noticed that the second hand wasn't moving from second to second but was jumping from one numberal to halfway in between then to the next numeral. As far as I could tell, the five seconds was still five seconds, but I couldn't be sure. Then, one night, it stopped totally. I tried shaking it and putting it under a lamp, then I took it and set in the sun for about an hour. It began running again, but still with the jumping between numerals.I used to be proud to be able to set this watch on the exact time from the Naval Observatory, but I can't do this any more. I am going to take it to the place I bought it, but I bet I have to send it back to Citizen. It cost me $250.00 at the time, so I see it's come down a little in price. I thought I was getting something better than I did."
2,THINNER THAN EXPECTED,"BOUGHT THESE FOR AN ACTIVITY WITH ADULTS.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR THIS AGE GROUP, AS THEYWERE SO THIN YOU COULD LITERALLY BEND THEM THEY SNAPPEDIN TWO; NO EFFORT REQUIRED."
1,Disappointing,"I heard a cute song on satellite and ordered the cd. The whole thing is nothing but cutesy type songs. You won't find excellent instrument playing here, either. I was also disappointed that the girls are on the Michigan Womyn's(sic) Music Festival schedule. As you know, that festival excludes men and attracts the most vulgar and narrowminded of the lesbian community. There is a lot of good folk music out there. I suspect that the good reviews are all by newcomers to this genre. It is a wonderful genre. I hope this mediocre cd made by poseurs is not their only exposure to the genre."
5,Too good to miss,"This album was my most amazing find from last year: hearing it got me to buy all their albums (which didn't disappoint). The lush, lilting vocals, dead-on harmonies, and the perfectly balanced acoustic instrumentation are powerful, beautiful and real - refreshing in an age of slick, overwrought production. I read somewhere that much lurks below the pleasing, old-time melodies and rhythms, and a few listens confirmed this.They have some beautiful original songs, and in each of their covers, whether a traditional song or one penned by Jolie Holland or Townes Van Zandt, they offer a fresh, unique interpretation.The Tanyas are too good to miss. Start with this album."
4,Dated but very inspiring,"This is a really good story of a family that adopts kids from different places. It's not the best writing (some of it is confusing) but it's a great story! It's also really dated so I'm sure the info in it isn't quite as accurate but again, if you are interested in adopting a child, especially one with special needs, it's a good read and very inspiring."
5,"Great single, Morrissey's best b-sides to date",It's crazy that some of his best songs are hidden on the backs of singles. But it gives us devoted fans an upper hand on fans who only buy albums END
2,Not what I expected,"I am a school counselor and I thought I would be able to use this DVD with my students. Instead, the documentary was aimed at adults who work with adolescent girls. It is a little outdated with very little information on Facebook/Twitter/internet in general.Probably a great documentary when it first came out"
5,Wonderful late beginner Christmas arrangements!!,"Great arrangements of religious favorites like ""Silent Night"" to secular favorites such as ""Jingle Bells"" Includes more unusual songs such as ""32 Feet and 8 Little Tails"", ""Hawaiian Christmas Song"", and ""Secret of Christmas"" 26 songs in all with all the classic favorites."
4,Proof That the American Dream Exists,"What an amazing life story! I read most of this book on a plane from Washington D.C. to LA. I was actually disappointed when the plane landed because I only had a few more chapters to go and I didn't want to stop reading.The author tells of his journey from the Mission District in San Francisco to halls of Congress. The book is surprisingly enjoyable considering that the author is a lawyer (and lawyers often write in a yawn inspiring manner). The passengers on my plane kept on turning around to look at me as I laughed out loud or stiffled tears. Republican or Democrat, young or old, rich or poor...you will enjoy this book!"
5,Nothing short of fascinating...,"""Rough Edges"" by James Rogan is a fascinating look at an interesting life. His sense of humor shines throughout the story, and the many adventures he had as a young man will keep you rolling. It's an inspirational story that made me feel good inside. His philosophical and political transformation is the most interesting part of the entire story. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in political science or just an interesting story. I enjoyed it."
2,flag,"i bought it for the design. that being said, it's not a nice, long lasting, heavy weight nylon material. it's a cheap, light weight, silk screened flag. not expected to last very long, maybe one season."
4,Welcome banner,"I love the design on this banner. The colors are bright and cheery.But, there are 2 things that Im not happy with.1. The word welcome is on the front side, but the other side it's backwards, so you have to decide which way to hang it, to read ""welcome"".For example, I put it up so if you are on my porch it reads the right way, but if the neighbors look over to read it, it's back wards.. I guess its not a big deal....2. There is no loop/fastener inside the banner top, to hook it to the flagpole. That annoys me because when the wind blows it, it slides down the pole and doesnt stay where it should be, at the end of the pole."
1,only good to look at,This toy falls apart everytime my son touches it. From the guns to the whole wings falling off. He now only plays with fusilage. If you only want to look at this toys it's great. Pretty frustrating for a 6 year old.
5,Such terrible thoughts,"When I play with this ship, my find is filled with such ... ooohhhh ..... terrible thoughts. Such evil deeds. Such naughty actions. Ooohhh .... you bad, bad, bad boy.What? No! Mom! I didn't mean it. No! I won't do it! I promise! I'll be a good boy! Don't put me back int' dark place! Please Mom ... no!!!!! (Right, that's it! When I become an evil Sith Lord, you're gonna get one right up your-"
4,son's birthday present,"although my son was elated to receive this as a present he was disapointed that there were no figures included. also not every figure fits into the cockpits easily. the snap on top doesnt allow just any figure to be used. it seems durable and easy to assemble and when your 8, its the bomb!"
5,The awesome new arc-170 starfighter!,"this is a very fun toy to play with but there are a few problems.one thing is that the wings fall of a lot.another thing is it does not come with pilots an a R2 droid and you have to go crazy looking for them.finally the missles sometimes get jammed. Overall,this toy is very fun to play with.(when it works)"
4,Errors in toy feature description,"Before you buy this toy, you should be aware that there is an error in the ""feature"" description. There are NOT any clone troopers or droid included with this ship! So, you will have to buy them separately, if you can find them."
5,ARC-170 WOW!!,This is another really great toy from the Star Wars collection made by Hasbro. They did a great job on this toy.
5,Star Wars Fan Finds it Fantastic,"My 8 year old loves Star Wars and couldn't find this model in the local stores. He is very happy with it and I like seeing him happy. He did almost all the assembly and stickers himself, so I was happy too."
4,Shut up u idots,"this is a cool ship with nifty eatures. The handle is small and hard to use, but o well. also i like how astromech doids ACTUALLY FIT!!!!!!! u here that obi and anikan starfighter makers!!!!! it fits. overall this is a good toy, it has problems, but what or who doesn't. also, all u idiots who say u cant find pilots need to burn. now hasbro lisened 2 u and that is all we can find on the shelves. o well."
2,"""It's not the greatest toy""","The bad thing about this toy:This toy, mmm..... not the best. sometimes, most of the time, parts fall off and it's a big pain. Usually the wings, but not only the wings. The guns fall off, the missles sometimes fire easily by accident, it's not the greatest toy. The good thing about this toy: You can imagine a lot of things when you're playing with this toy, if you're like me. The extra wings can come out easily, four of them. But what I'm trying to say here is, you probaly shoudn't buy this toy.If you're Maurice Russo, I don't know what to say."
2,A toy to make young boys frustrated and parents annoyed,"My son purchased this toy with a gift card he recieved for his birthday. He was very excited about it. When it arrived, his parents were quite amazed at just how big it is (I know, we should check the dimensions first). It's really big; too big, I think to really get much playing value out of it. Also, it does not stay together. It has not broken, but the wings and guns do not stay on under even light play. My son still is proud of it, but he does not play with it any more. He just told me he wished he had bought something else with his gift card.Not the best toy for the price. I'd say it's better to get one of the smaller Star Wars vehicles, plus lots of guys--THAT'S what my son and his friends always play with."
1,not worth it,its so dumb id rather make one out cardboard. this gives starwars a bad name not that it already has one. worst thing ever. worth as much as a used toilet seat.
1,"poorly designed item, back end of shoe tree is not adjustable.","i bought this to hold my pumps in place when packing a travel bag very tight, wanted to avoid the toes getting smooshed in the bag. I got these assuming that the back end that presses on the heel side of the shoe would be adjustable, but its not. It's extremely firm and way too long for any woman's shoe, so it had to bend to stay in place. THe metal is very strong so it's hard to get in palce, creates a lot off excess volume becuase of the metal bends upward. It's just awkward all around and not very useful."
3,This wrench is made in China and is not American quality,"I was happy when I pulled my new Crescent wrench out of the box the other day. I was happy until I couldn't find the USA stamping on it. Then on the packaging, on the back, at the bottom right hand corner there it was. CHINA. It may seem like this is nothing to even write about to some people but this is another American job gone.As far as the product I would rate it as just between fair and good. It seems to be solid and the Crestalloy is nice and light but the action is not smooth. It is a little catchy and rougher than I was expecting. I just hope it lasts."
1,Cheap Chinese Garbage,"Goodbye Crescent. I just saw your latest batch at the hardware store, new logo and all, now MADE IN CHINA. You'll be taking your chances buying this if you want an American made product that lasts -- There are probably some left in the supply chain but once they're all gone that's it.Go with an ""adjustable wrench"" maker in the U.S. -- Ridgid makes some great American products as does Klein as does Snap-On.I just can't believe it's the best employer labor market in decades, and companies are still moving great American tools overseas for a few extra cents profit. Damn the craftsmanship, material quality and longevity."
3,"Dirección excelente, interpretes cuestionables.","Claudio Abbado demuestra en esta grabación su afinidad con la música de Berg, la dirección es precisa, llena de detalles y aún apasionada en algunos momentos, sin embargo, ni Hildegard Behrens ni Franz Grudheber, están a la altura. Yo creo que Wozzeck es una ópera en la que la música va al fondo del subconsciente de los personajes y necesita por tanto de una gran interpretación. La mejor versión en mi opinión es la de Karl Böhm con la Deutsche Oper, con Evelyn Lear y Dietrich Fischer-Diaskau en los papeles principales, además del gran Gerhard Stolze que canta un Capitán incomparable."
2,"Great conducting, sad inaccurate singing","When this performance started coming out of my speakers, I was thrilled. Abbado conducts with a warmth, cohesion and tension that is wonderful to hear, and his orchestra is positively radiant. Unfortunately, the principal singers are not up to their roles. Grundheber barks menacingly but is extraordinarily sloppy and inaccurate with his note-values, making a mess of the title role; Hildegard Behrens, though more musically accurate, is about 20 years past her prime, and her voice wobbles all over the place.What I'm wondering is why the classic recording with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Evelyn Lear and the fabulous conducting of Karl Bohm (also on DG) is out of print. When it came out about 8 years ago, in a 3-CD set with ""Lulu,"" I snapped it up, and have enjoyed it ever since.Save your money on this one. Look for a reissue of the Bohm set."
5,Everyone should watch this,"I think that everyone should watch this movie! If they did, then maybe people would stop complaining about the fact that there are never any good movies out. I think this movie is funnier than any other comedy that i've seen. The rest are crap compared to Mail Order Wife. I laughed for like 20 minutes straight watching this. I recomended it to all of my friends. I'm sure they're gonna get a kick out of it."
3,"OK Movie, But",I don't understand that why the wife from Burma but speaks Chinese as her native language. Maybe it's a part of humor. I just don't get it.
4,Dystopian masterpiece...,"...this film reminds me of the work of Todd Solondz, who also specializes in making movies designed to make the audience squirm and cringe, yet keeps us riveted out of morbid curiousity as well as strong filmcraft and the unmistakable stench of ugly reality.I had not read the synopsis/blurb on the box real closely before watching it, so like many other reviewers I was also not entirely sure if this were a documentary or a mockumentary until about 2/3rds through.Really superb characters, script, acting and direction."
4,Oshkosh Memories,"What's bigger than the Ky. Derby and the Indy 500 COMBINED? Why, the largest air show in the world known simply as ""Oshkosh."" This book tells the wonderful stories of the word's greatest aviation event in the words of the pilots and their support teams that make it the greatest show on earth. The book has plenty of aviation superstars but also the average pilot who tells their stories of the years of work it takes to produce a home-made airplane and fly it to the Mecca of sport aviation, Oshkosh, B-gosh! Great book for young adults looking for a positive direction in life."
4,Visually Delightful and Well Written,"If you ever wondered how modern things worked - even a little bit curious - you'll enjoy reading or scanning this book. The pictures, graphics and design are outstanding and useful in understanding how things work. The text is written so a general newspaper reader can digest the content. This is a far ranging work with 80 entries. The six sections and a sample from each indicate the range of content and degree or relevance.Home: Digital cameraComputers: Compressing musicEntertainment: Laser tagBusiness: Face recognitionTransportation: Electronic tollsScience: Weather radarThe book is nearly a decade old, but the content seems just right for a non-technical reader. My only qualm is that the text often repeats much of what has been covered in the graphics."
4,Kawasaki Bayou 220/300 & Prairie 300 Atv Owners Workshop Manual,"The manual is quite comprehensive but the differences in the 220 and 300 engine are substantial and the book focused on the 300 engine. It will say something like, ""do this procedure, but if you are working on the 220 engine there will only be one screw instead of two. The engine pictures are of the the 300 so they don't necessarily match. Book is great if you own a 300. Only OK if you own a 220 like me."
5,Pretending the Bed is a Raft,"I love this author. I'm from Florida, and she writes very charming stories that incorporate small town Florida. She is very easy to read. There are several short stories in this book that allow you to pick it up and read an entire story in less than half an hour. Great if you don't have a ton of time to invest in your reading."
5,Live-recording Masterpiece,"Ignore unfair comments to this masterpiece. Listen to it twice and pay attention to the words, music and acting. It is Mozart's music with all its beauty where everything fits (words, singing, music, feelings). In Harnoncourt's Figaro all music is sublime.Harnoncourt is the only person that can afford to take risks, playing the opera a bit slower is a great decision. This is perhaps shocking in the First act. But listen (or watch) the second and third act to appreciate Mozart's music at full extent and realize why Harnoncourt is one of the greatest conductors alive."
2,What a disappointment,"I, too, wish I hadn't wasted my money on this recording which I bought having seen Anna Netrebko in L'Elisir d'Amor. But for Le Nozze di Figaro I much prefer the Peter Hall Glyndebourne production with Kiri Te Kenawa as the Countess, although Netrebko's acting was worth watching in the Salzburg production. The introduction of the cherub distracts from the music, the camera, and viewer, spent more time watching that ridiculous character than attending to the music. The cherub seems to have been introduced to entertain jaded Salzburg habitués who have seen this opera too many times already and clamour for novelty for its own sake."
1,Abomination!!!,"If I had been in the audience at this performance I would have booed from the very beginning and throughout this horrible production. The singing was OK, the recits too slow and ponderous and WHAT was going on in the pit with all those pauses that added beats to pieces?The Eros dancer was unnecessary; the Count wa a simpering idiot and I couldn't decide if he was sweating or had allergies or a nose bleed. Bartolo in a wheel chair? COME ON! It became about picking up papers and how he would get back in the chair! The ""non piu andrai"" was the worst travesty. I'm sorry the Salzburg audience had to be subjected to this at those prices. I will have a great deal of trouble watching the rest and THANK GOD I didn't buy it!"
1,Better listened to then watched!,"What a missed opportunity! Great performers, great orchestra, in a perverse, misguided direction! An extra character has been introduced who goes around grimacing, juggling, tossing oranges and apples around the set during the action, or caressing or making teasing actions at the characters distracting from the action. And talk about sparse; Susanna sings her opening aria about her hat without wearing or holding one! Most of action takes place on a bare set with no furniture. This is a travesty and a disappointment. I was so hoping for a new production with wide screen, superb sound and top performers but this is not it."
4,Clear Job,"Powerfull tool, clear job. Ps One consoles are 100 % susceptible to heat. Be carefull and get a real clear job. You can install your own mod chip with this usefull tool"
5,Worthy of Praise!!!,"I have heard many, many recordings of this work and none has has come even close to this recording!!!The Orchestra led by Levine is superb and the chorus dynamic.Levine takes a lot of the tempi slower than most recordings, but this wise decision lets the music breathe and you can take in fully the genius that is Mozart!!!Clear sound and subtle motion.The soloists are really the icing on the cake. Kathleen Battle is astounding!!!! I have never heard the 'Et incarnatus est' sound like that!! Also,the duet 'Domine Deus' is absolutely brilliant. Lella Cuberli sings with much zest creating the second half of a dynamic duo. The chorus in the 'Cum Sancto spiritu' is amazing. The orchestra has the right balance and articulation.Really a stellar cast, orchestra and chorus, all under the baton of a great artist. This is a recording that makes you believe!!!"
1,horrible,engine is not powerful enough to pull the train. all of bachmann's steam engines are underpowered and burn up quickly and i have 4 diferent ones to prove it
1,Horrible,"This is a terrible product. The engine and first car are one piece hinged in the middle. The engine is fake and is actually pushed by the attached car. Because of this, the engine keeps derailing and jack knifes constantly. The three trailing cars are completely made of plastic and don't weigh enough for the joining knuckles to hinge as the train goes around the track, so they too keep derailing. I bought this brand new and would not suggest buying it for anything other than the track."
4,Great but small,"This is a nice little train. It's well detailed though the connects between the stage coaches and engine are just tiny plastic pins and that concerns me over time. The track is great with the EZ N/S. This train is really cute though. It would not be good for under, say, a 9 foot Christmas tree (which we have), but around a tabletop tree, in an actual train layout, or something where you can see it up close is great. This is not a kid's train, but a really cute and nice simple train. I like it. It's not ""beefy"" enough for my husband who promptly went out and bought a smoker locomotive and a slew of passenger cars to run on the same track. I pull the husband's tempermental and complicated train off when he is gone and run this nice little train. Just bear in mind, the whole train is something like 5 or 6 inches long. But it is really nice and runs really well."
5,Nat.review,"I am very happy with these shoes. Will be a fall shoe,so haven't worn them much. Normally wear a AA, this is a B.Kept them because I'll wear socks in fall anyway. Lovethe stitching and design. Thanks"
2,apple picker,"The apple picker came in three pieces. Although in theory, it should have been easy to screw the plates to join the two four foot poles together, it proved to be very difficult. The screw holes did not line up with the plate holes, therefore new screw holes had to be drilled. The old holes were filled and I am hoping that the poles have not been compromised due to the revision."
1,Thanks but no Thanks,"I ordered this item as a gift for my son, who lives in Miami while we live in New Orleans. We planned a trip to Miami so I ordered it ahead of time so that we could bring it on the road trip with us. It was promised to arrive by 9/7/10. It didn't come by the 9th, the day we left for the journey. My daughter picked up mail, etc for us and she said it arrived on the 11th (Saturday)... too late!I wrote Amazon a note...indicating that I would like to return the item...no answer to date. My ""last"" experiece with AMAZON Dot Com...perhaps you all should go to the Amazon and see what you're doing to it with many of your products that you offer. Meanshile I'm discusted. Thanks for nothing...except maybe my money back! Dave Wessel"

3,Ish was iffy at best,I hate to complain but several of the pages had stains on them! I purchased it as a gift and would have gladly paid more to have had one that WAS in great shape like they said!!
5,Cute Story,Love to read this story aloud to students in primary grades. It also could be linked to using suffixes. :)
5,Wonderful!,"Here is a picture book that speaks to ""the courage to create."" Beautifully illustrated, Ish tells of Ramon, the boy with the gift of art. Reading the story, we realize that we all have a little of Ramon with us: the creative soul that wishes to bring forth a vision. And this is why we feel for Ramon when his brother makes an insensitive comment about his art. For us, it may not be a brother: it may be a thoughtless teacher, a cranky adult, or even some part of us that doubts our creative side. Whatever the source, an insensitive remark can cause us to wish to shut down our own wonderful creativity. But fortunately, there is another force that encourages us to keep going, and in this wonderful story, this positive energy is embodied in Ramon's little sister Marisol. How can we fail to cheer for Ramon's courage to create, in spite of the difficulties and doubts? Ramon is a great hero, and this book is a true source of inspiration for children and adults."
5,an All time Favourite,"This delightful book by Peter Reynolds is a delight to read and share with children. The themes of persistence, resilience and self belief are ones that adults need to talk with children about. This book (along with many of Reynold's texts) encourages children to think about and discuss accepting themselves and following their passions. It is a great book for use in Philosphy circles and for leading discussion about positive relationships. Enjoy!"
5,Great book that is perfect for classrooms!,"""Ish"" is a great book to share with children. After his older brother teases him about his artwork, Ramon loses his love for drawing, until his younger sister teaches him an important lesson. She shows him that art does not have to be perfect, and even when a drawing of a vase doesn't look like a vase, it still looks ""vase-ish"". This book is wonderful for teaching students that not everything needs to be perfect, and that even imperfect things can still be enjoyed. A lot of students obsess so much about getting everything perfect that they neglect to see the real purpose of an activity. They worry so much about drawing a perfect dog or spelling every word perfectly that they cannot see the bigger picture. ""Ish"" will teach these students that imperfection can be a wonderful thing."
5,Inspirational!!,"I bought this book for my four year old son who had practically zero interest in creating art. He would take crayon to paper for about 14.6 seconds before tossing both aside and moving on to his other toys. After several readings of Ish, he (independently and unprovoked) picked up a marker and paper and drew something person-ish!!! As he was drawing, he was telling me what the body parts were. I was glowing and speechless. Since then, he has been walking around proud as can be with his art and creating more to boot. I am so happy to have found this book. I think every child has a creative side and I'm happy to have found a way to get my little guy to express his ish! If you have a reluctant artist, I highly recommend this purchase! As a matter of fact, I even recommend it for the most artful child as a reminder to draw happily and with abandon!"
5,daugher loves it,"my daughter's favorite book is Beautiful Oops and this is a close second. As a six-year-old, she loves the idea of freedom of expression instead of the impossible task of making everything 'look right.'"
5,Good Aromatherapy Guide,"Gwydion tells us how to blend and work with oils and instead of exact recipes for blends he allows the aromatherapist the leeway to use their own intuition (and nose) to guide in the final porportions by showing the major, minor and trace elements in the blend. Informative and inciteful."
1,"Don't bother, these aren't worth anything",These are cheap cotton gloves with a logo on the back. You would be better off buying the cheapest pair of gardening gloves from home depot (even if they are pink with flowers)
5,Great Sealing Connectors,Great to see Fine workmanship on the connectors and would buy again if needed. I have used many Wilson producta and appreciate their outstanding customer support.
3,Not as I remembered,"The first time I saw a cresent wrench, I was handing it to my Dad working on the car...it was 1959, It was my favorite tool because it said cresent on it and I could read at 5. But things have changed I guess... the manufacturing tolerances got a little sloppy and there is too much play in the adjustment. So now you have to underadjust and wiggle it on the head of a bolt in oder to get a tighter fit. Back in the day when it was manufactured in the USA, it would keep its fit when adjusting it."
4,"Well, it's a Crescent, but...","I had to exchange the first unit--problem with the original casting that caused the knurl to bind on each revolution. Not sure how that made it all the way through plating, assembly, etc., so that I needed to provide quality control. The second unit is great and is hanging right beside the 8"" that my Dad gave me that's probably 50+ years old."
4,A mixed feeling...,"I get a bit of mixed feeling about this CD. The sonata is played with at most beauty of touch and charm. It is a romantic Mozart at best. But the concerto... I had my hopes up very high for the concerto since I adore most of Horowitz's late Mozart recordings, but this is not quite in the same league. It is too briskly paced overall and as a result, sounds rushed, although plenty of color and vitality is present. Giulini was never my favorite conductor and my opinion did not change after listening to this CD. If Horowitz were to play a Mozart concerto in this manner, he should have picked No.19 (F major) or No.26 (D major). They would have suited his approach better. Carlos Kleiber would have been my choice of conductor. He would have created an ideal lively accompaniment for Horowitz. Giulini sounds too businesslike for my taste. But this CD is definitely worth buying for the sonata alone, and concerto is definitely an intersting curio in Horowitz's repertoire."
3,"not Mozart, not Horovitz","This is Mozart played by Horowitz as Horowitz thought Mozart would have wanted these pieces to be played. Not only is the exposition repeated in the sonata, the second repeat is observed in the first movement of the piano concerto and in the first movement of the piano sonata. The tempos are faster than usual. The left hand is more prominent than usual. These are not faults! No one knows how these pieces would have been played by Mozart! For those who want to know how Horowitz thought how Mozart thought these pieces should be played, this is a must have."
5,"Not everything, but very reasonable and informative","I bought this product a few months ago, having never played guitar, and having not played any instrument at all in 21 years.The software is easy to use and clear to follow. As advertised, it clearly teaches the basics of guitar, but there are holes which can be filled using the internet and possibly an instructor.There would also be some benefit to having a chart included to show actual notes along with the fret number methind that is successfully employed.The teaching method employed is step progression, learning an easy song and steadiky increasing in difficulty."
1,Waste of money,"I thought that I may enjoy this product but the disc only worked about 4 to 5 times.No problem, according to the accompanying paperwork - send in your info and they willsend you another. That was 6 months ago, and I'm still waiting. Now that I needanother one, I guess I'll be giving my money to someone who backs up their claims."
1,Don't be fooled,"If you want green hangers, go somewhere else. These hangers were a color best described as seafoam.I have tried several times to contact the seller for a replacement with no avail.This was easily the worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon purchase."
2,NOT from the USA,"I have not used this product yet, though it seems little different from any other set of bolt cutters. I ordered it because the manufacturer claims it is made in the USA, and Amazon states its origin as from the USA. This is deceptive - it is only assembled in the USA, with components from Thailand, Malaysia, etc. If I wanted another low-quality Chinese tool, I could have bought one anywhere. If you are looking for bolt cutters made in the USA, look elsewhere."
5,A variety of recipes and excellent nutrition/exchange info,"A good general cookbook with some of the best nutrition exchange information. Searching bookshelves, I've been surprised at how few of the books (particularly for diabetics) didn't give nutrition information in any depth. I have a relative new to diabetes and the food exchanges, counting fat grams, etc. are confusing and difficult--this was almost exactly what I wanted."
2,Disappointed....,"I wanted a diabetic cookbook because my husband and my mother (who lives with us) are trying to eat healthier. I thought following some of the diabetic recipes would be a good healthy, sensible way to eat. I didn't realize that about 1/2 of this entire book is information about diabetes.... the other half is recipes. We don't need all the technical information on diabetes. If you are looking for info on diabetes, then this is definitely the book for you. But if you are looking for healthy diabetic recipes only, this is NOT the book. I wish I had known before I had purchased this book that it is an information first/recipes second book."
2,Not great for me,"I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. My nutritionist basically told me to watch my carbs, but dont limit my fat/salt/etc at this time. I bought this along with a Betty Crocker Diabetic Cookbook Everyday Meals Easy as 1-2-3. I am glad I bought the other one. It has pictures and is much easier to navigate. In my case the New Diabetic cookbook spends too much time on diabetes information and isn't as appealing for meals. Great for someone else, just not me!"
2,Look for a recent publishing date...not this book,"I bought this book hoping I could eat a little better, since I have ""elevated blood sugar levels"" but I think most recipes in this book would give me ""elevated cholesterol levels"" instead. At its publishing date I'm sure it was better than what most people were using to cook with, but we now know that margarine is full of the bad stuff that clogs our arteries, and just about every recipe seemed to have that as an ingredient. So if you're looking for healthy cooking, this isn't the place to start. I suggest finding a book with a publishing date of the last few years, that would have taken into consideration trans fats and our need to eliminate them."
4,Good CD,"I didn't like this album at first but I gave it another listen and I've decided that it's good. It's still not perfect though, Banner's voice is still very annoying and sounds incredibly fake. Also the lead single ""Play"" is still a rip off of the Yin Yang Twins but it's still better. I also didn't like the song ""Ridin"". I thought it was incredibly racist and set blacks back 50 years and I'm not talking about Banner's verse. I can't believe that Banner would allow Talib Kweli and Dead Prez to promote the same kind of racism and bigotry and that he claims to be fighting against. Besides that everything else on here is good. ""Blood War"" and ""Gangster Walk"" are my two favorites on here."
2,Bad Rep,"This album is terrible. As a Mississippian, I know David Banner did a poor job of displaying the quality of music in Mississippi. Besides the singles that were released, this cd has absolutely nothing to offer. I commend him for trying to put Mississippi on his back, but if he's going to represent on meaningless (how many different times can you refer to your genitalia on one cd?) and useless (even though it's a southern cd, the beats aren't even that good) albums like this, I'd rather he left ""The Sip"" out of it."
5,david banner,"David Banner's album ""Certified"" is one of his best work...I really enjoyed the whole album. It is banging!!! I especially like the song ""Treat Me Like a King"". If you don't have this album yet..you need to go out and get it, i'm sure you'll love it."
4,This new style is good,"The new cd ""Certified"" by David Banner is pretty darn good. I have only listened to a couple songs so far. If you enjoy rap to a rock beat (kinda like the Jay-Z and Linkin Park Mash-up) then you will absolutely LOVE ""Crossroad"". It definitely has a hard rock beat with fast rapping. Good track. ""Bloody War"" is a good hard-hitting song with a good beat. ""On everything"" has a good fast beat but the hook is...different. has fast rapping with a ""marching band"" type beat. If you've heard of David Banner, then you obviously already know ""Play."" its a decent song that will definitely blow up like ""Wait/the whisper song"" by Ying Yang. But those are the only songs i have listened to so far. I'm definitely glad i got this CD. its gonna be bumpin for a while!"
1,Obnoxious and embarrassing,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed. If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.Repulsive!"
1,Not worth a title....,"in his thank you's he said it's his best work... i'll admit some of the songs are good.... but the ""ridin"" song went a little bit too far, who does he think buys his stuff? 80% of rap sold is to ""crackers"" he's refering to wanting to punch them in the face etc and talking about how he doens't like ""crackers"" keeping his kind down etc. Play is good, just a copy of Wait (the whisper song) and ""on everything"" is good. I was gonna buy his other cds, but after that one song i won't, i'll never support him again.... of course that is what he said he wants LOL... so he will get it."
2,Disappointing.,"What happened to the David Banner on his first albums? I liked that much better. MTA and Baptized were much better then this one. He went a little softer and more mainstream on this one.. which isnt always a bad thing, but in this case, id say it is. I wouldnt recommend this one. Crossroads is a decent track, i didnt care for most of it though."
4,gangsta Walk!,"David Banner come sout hard and strong on certfifed with songs like Bloody War f/ BG, and Ridin w/ Talib Kweli, and Dead Prez. he then gets it crunk with songs like Gangsta Walk f/ Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball and MJG, and Marcus and The Lil Jon produced Treat me Like f/ jadakiss. His lyrics can be weak at times but is still good."
1,this cd blowz,dont buy this if u like rap listen to something that soesnt suck and from someone who can actually rap peace out
3,Banner Bitch,"This is a decent album with some hot tracks like On Everything, 2 Fingers, Treat me Like. But what I don't like is this racistic song Ridin where he Dead Prez and Talib Kweli discriminates White people.If a White man had wrote rhymes like those, he would have been considered a racist."
2,Der Deutsche Mensch,"The print format used capital letters which distracted the reader and made reading more difficult. The content was enjoyable with a general summary of items which could be found in another book by T, E. Glover, which had greater details.The ending of the book left me wanting more. The claims made near the end of the book did not seem to be supported with any final statements of action taken or proof beyond circumstantial evidence."
3,Nice to look at....PERIOD,"The cover was very appealing. First impressions etc;. The inside photos even more so. The writing however sounded like the ramblings of a spoiled child living in an unreachable reality sometimes and at other times, the snobbery of an aristocracy only appreciated in the mind of the writer and those who really believe that paradise can only be created by the writer.I live in the Bahamas and so yes I have a paradise of my own, but does anyone really care about 'my personal paradise' so much that they would read about it. I think not. The thing that makes simple beauty, well simply beautiful is simply leaving it alone.Final thot; Nice to look at.....PERIOD.other books I own - CARIBBEAN STYLE; CARIBBEAN ELEGANCE; ISLAND STYLE."
2,Disappointingly dull,"I saw India Hicks on Larry King, so I got this book. Unfortunately, her decorating and style sense is a lot more dull than her personal life as a member of England's royal family. The island mood comes through in this book but the photos could have been taken ten or twenty years ago. I assumed the book would feature something newer."
1,All white decor at an island house??,"I bought this book hoping it was the same book about island homes that I enjoyed so much at a house I rented on Maui. WRONG. Photo after photo of white bedrooms, white dining rooms, white living rooms with model sailboats with white sails and white shells in shadow boxes, white walls, white paintings. Some photos of the white houses from outside show grass and green palms. The Hicks' office has RED walls (oooh so daring).Somewhere there must be an outside place for guests to scrub themselves with very strong soap and change in to a white bathrobe before entering the house. If you visit, be prepared for all white food.Gets my vote for ""Most Boring Decorating Book Ever"" award."
5,Also bought several options....,"I concur with other reviewer's assessment - this is a great little grill. I bought it as a temporary hold-over until the backyard remodel with outdoor kitchen is complete. I was initially concerned about the relatively low Btu output, but I must say it sears steaks very well. Definitely exceeds my expectations.I also bought the cart stand, cover, and Weber's cast iron griddle. I use the griddle to do oven-roasted potatoes, and the cart is very nice. NOTE: The cart comes with a propane tank hose, no need to order separately."
1,junk,"this grill is worthless. I had this grill for almost 1 year, I should have gotten rid of it a long time ago. it starts about 20% of the time I want to use it, which is quit often. several times I had to use a tooth pick to poke the holes in the burner to get it to start . If and when you can get it to start it cooks alright.but when you are depending on your grill to come through when cooking a meal, this grill will test your nerves. I LOST MINE . GOT ANOTHER GRILL... GOOD LUCK IF YOU BUY THIS GRILL."
4,Weber Q 220,"I bought this to replace an old Weber charcoal grill we've been using to tailgate for 15 yrs. With the kids and time constraints, the charcoal just got to be too much.I'm very happy I made the switch. Grill heats up fast and provides an even temperature and gets hot enough to grill anything we need. Very sturdy construction and common sense design which is what I expect from Weber and why you pay a bit more for this. But, it's well worth it. Having it available in Red & Black is perfect for the Rutgers games. GO RU!!!"
4,I'm suprised,"This little grill is well built, heavy and big for a ""small"" grill. I grilled six burgers comfortably. The small propane cylinder is about 1/2 gone in the half hour it to to preheat, grill, and burn off the grill. I ordered the 20# adaptor and would suggest it as a must have, as well as the folding cart. I'm Pleased with purchase and suggest to anyone not cooking for a crowd."
5,BJG,Great compact grille to have. I have owned the bigger Weber gas grills and this Weber Q 220 really matches the big ones in even cooking!
4,"Great little BBQ, but pricey","This portable Weber works great and rivals my full size Weber. Lots of room on the grilling surface, built in thermometer is handy. The only complaints are that it is kinda expensive for a portable BBQ and the starter frequently take several attempts before it lights, where my full size Weber starts allmost always on the 1st attempt."
5,Valve Spring Compressor,Worked as advertised. Saved me a lot of time over the bar-type compressor. Great for overhead valve engines.
5,Small engine valve tool,"This item was set to me one day early, and performed exactly as stated. It was the best price I was able to find anywhere, and would not hesitate to recommend this item to others."
1,Only laster for a few uses,"This wasn't quite the right shape for the Honda CB500 engine I wanted to take apart, but I was able to get it to work. Unfortunately, it broke after removing 5 of the 8 valves."
5,EXCELLANT PRODUCT,GLADLIHTTM WORKS GREAT.PERFECT SIZE FOR MY COMPUTER DESK. IT TAKES ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS TO NOTICE A DIFFERANCE...CONFIRMEDED BY MY DR.I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDERS.lOOKS JUST LIKE A PIECE OF FURNITURE AROUND THE HOUSE.
2,"Avoid, you can find better.","I bought these for work. Most of the time I use aviation snips to cut 016 and 020 aluminum sheets. The main problem that I have with the Wiss offsets is that the nut which helps hold the blades together, continually loosens off. This causes the metal to curl between the blades, leaving an undesired ""lip"". In some cases, this causes the blades to not cut at all (during precise/short cuts).Another issue is that from new, the spring binds and does not offer a smooth cutting action. Sometimes the blades do not fully close because of the binding. I do like the non-offset Wiss snips, but I find them more awkward to use.If you are interested in offsets, I'd recommend Midwest. Fellow workers swear by the Ridgid offsets (actually produced by Midwest). I have not used Klenk snips, but I have used Malco offsets, which share a similar design. I prefer the Midwest offsets over the Malco."
4,grand theft parsons,"Pretty good album, I wish it would have included ""grevious angel"" which was on the movie but not the soundtrack."
5,Amazing.,"I'm currently working as a yoga instructor at St. Mary's Hospital for physically handicapped children. This book is helping me tremendously. There are specific guidelines and exercises to do with pictures. Also, the true life success stories are very inspirational. Thank You."
5,Excellent,I was very happy with the book. I plan on taking a course with the author so this should help prepare me for it.
5,Changed My Life,"After reading the heart-warming story of Ms. Sumar and her daughter Roberta, I have been inspired. Yoga is such a natural method of healing that more and more people are turning to it every day. It seems only logical to take it to the next step, as the author does in this book, and use it as an aid in the development of children with special needs.I found the manual to be illustrated with easy to follow instructions, and it clearly shows how to adapt the poses as the child develops, regardless of his/her age and abilities. Ms. Sumar lists the benefits of each pose and if certain poses should be avoided due to a child's condition.I have decided to expand my own daily yoga practices by becoming a teacher and will be looking into attending one of the Yoga for the Special Child trainings this year. This book has helped me make the decision to devote my life to helping other people directly with yoga."
3,another life is better,"a side is a little less than humming, b-sides are darling, another life is progress."
1,The swimmer fails again,"Only in Massachusetts can this fat blowhard be taken seriously. This book is a rambling attack on President Bush. Bush is evil. Bush is causing inflation. Bush is the cause of terrorism. Blah, blah, blah.There is almost nothing that Teddy does not blame Bush for. I also get the impression that he dearly wishes that he was 20 years younger. I don't get the impression that he is wildly impressed with the Democratic candidates for 2008.The most ironic part of the book is where Kennedy attempts to speak for the virtues of the ""common man, the factory worker, etc."". He would know a common man if his life depended on it. And Mary Jo Koepekne was not available for comment."
1,"Kennedy , only a mother could like this water baby","To believe that Ted Kennedy could actually muster a thought, due well write a book is preposterous.Surely a ghost writer, and not a good one has written this tripe. This bloated belly-aching "" Liberal Icon"" comes across like the Robert Redford character in THE CANDIDATE where his mantra slogan is ""There has got to be a better way""...of course at the end the Redford character, who is elected, hasn't one idea in his head. Kennedy, who believes in democractic socialism pours forth his nonsense like some fat Budda dispensing silly wisdom to the true believers.Churchill said ""Socialism is a philosophy of failure, a creed of the ignorant and the gospel of envy... who share the value of misery""... Surely Ted Kennedy is another of many democrats who are deacons of this convoluted church of idiotic unworkable beliefs. Save your money and don't bother with this book.. you'll need it to pay the taxes that Kennedy and his merry bunch will inflict and plunder."
3,Overpriced,"does what is is supposed to do, but overpriced. I will be much more careful next time i buy a new coil, only to find out i had to purchase this pigtail to adapt.this should have been part of the coil package for an extra buck, rather than another sixteen. Had no choice once i purchased the coil."
5,Works like a charm!,I purchased this wiring adapter after ordering a LiveWire's Ignition Coil for my 98 Jeep Wrangler Sport. It plugged right in to the old flat pins female couple and made the connection to the round pins male couple on the LiveWires Ignition Coil. Worked right away without issue and was easy to install!
4,Well Written,Sometimes there is nothing like a nice imagining of histories alternative outcomes and this book does a great job of doing this.
3,Interesting in parts,"I enjoy alternative histories and thought this might be up my alley. It's structure parallels the book ""What If?"" wherein various authors write short vignettes about possible historical outcomes. There are several alternatives to WWII, many of them interesting, but most contain so much military hardware detail that it interferes with the plot.I was looking forward to something of the post-war experience but alas, these are almost all written from the perspective of the combatant...."
1,Worst alternate history book I ever bought,"One of the few books I ever quit in the middle. Normally when I finish a book, I trade it at a used bookstore or give it to friends. This one went in the garbage. Long on miniscule battle details, short on stories. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,Not written by Peter Tsouras!!,"I felt cheated by this book. The description says Peter Tsouras authored it. He did NOT. He ""edited"" the book. Nine of the ten ""dynamic scenarios"" included in this book were actually written by other people! Peter only wrote the last scenario.The short story format is annoying. Just as I got interested in one or two scenarios, they would end! None of the scenarios are linked together -- so decisions made in one story don't affect decisions in the following scenarios.Some of the scenarios that are heavy on unit movement and strategic views were sorely lacking in maps. Being told that 25 units advanced on a 5 mile front from point A to point B means nothing. Showing the reader the advance with a map brings the point home.There is a small section of pictures with alternative descriptions.All in all, I was disappointed in this book and the mis-leading description published by Amazon."
3,Solid,"This is a collection of 10 alternate history stories by accomplished military history writers and editors. Peter Tsouras writes the last story and edits the book. The cover and title are a bit misleading. ""Ten Dynamic Scenarios in Which Hitler Wins the War"". This is true of the early stories, but as the book goes on, a few stories end with Germany simply surviving the end of the war, and one in which they lose the war. Hitler is also killed in more than one scenario. That aside, I found all of the stories well written. The more enjoyable ones were those that only twisted history a little bit to show that things could have been very different very easily. Those stories felt much more realistic than the ones that took major liberties with the ""what if"" scenario. I liked the book and will be picking up the companion book, ""Rising Sun Victorious"" next."
4,Excellent play!,Only Tennessee Williams could create this incredible ghost play about a meeting between Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald at the asylum in which Zelda lived until her death. Thought provoking and magical - a must read for any Williams fan or person interested in stage plays.
3,"Namo WebEditor is Great, but get new version 5.5","Overall, Namo WebEditor version 5.5 is amoung the best available. However, don't bother with version 5. It has bugs, and is missing many of the great features in version 5.5. Also, the price is nearly the same. Please see my review of version 5.5."
4,"""We knew him when""","Compared with some of the grandiose technicolored widescreen versions pf ""The Three Musketeers"" this 1966 black and white production looks cramped and primitive, but it has virtues of its own: the acting is of excellent quality throughout the cast and the personalities of the musketeers are more sharply defined. What is wryly amusing is that even in the DVD version, Jeremy Brett gets only second billing; his name does not even appear on the front cover of the box! Yet even in this youthful appearance the sensitivity and emotional range of this gifted actor are apparent. For his prtformance alone this set would be worth buying."
4,good,Good BBC production.If you like the three musketeers you'll like this.The best is Jeremy Brett playing D'artagnan.Of course a must have for any Brett's fan.
5,absolute beauty,"this is a very interesting book, and i enjoyed reading about what ayurveda has to offer the world."
2,Thumb down,"This is my first book on Ayurveda. It meets my expectation but I have to take 3 stars off - one off as I don't like beauty book which sells a certain brand or line of product. It's hard to read a book with clouded conscience. Second off because the mentioning of natural science, especially physics is out of place and very silly. Thirdly, the ideas are so diluted that I keep skipping lines to look for the points. Not a very pleasant experience."
1,Pratima is a HYPOCRITE!,"I read her book and she stresses that you shouldn't put anything on your skin that you can't eat. In her book she gives her own 100% natural recipes for a natural body care routine. So I looked at her ingredients on her own product line and surprise, surprise... Her products are chock full of multi-syllabic chemicals that I can't pronounce. I was SHOCKED! It was hard to take her seriously after seeing these glaring contradictions."
1,Absolutely the worst book i have ever read,"I was very interested in ayurveda and how it can make your skin look and feel better. After reading many reviews and researching the topic a bit, i decided to buy this book. And was very dissapointed. The information in the book itself is very good and useful but the style in which the book is written is horrible. Getting through the first chapter alone was impossible. In fact I only read 2 complete chapters of the book. After that i skimed the book... it was the only way i could stay awake. Also the book seems to advertise the author's products. That is not the job of a book. All in all i would never recommend this book to anyone ... i considered it a complete waste of money. Lets face it if u can get a book with the same information plus a better and more interesting writing style, why not get it? Why stick to this book? my advice: move on, look at the other books."
1,Aboslute Beauty: Radiant Skin and Inner Harmony Through the Ancient Secrets Ayurveda,"This book was very enjoyable, I have learnt a lot from this book, it has made me made me aware of Ayurvedic practise. I have since been seeing a Ayurvedic practitioner on a regular basis, I refer to this book in regards to treatments for my self,I would recommend this book to all. There is something in this book for everyone to benefit from."
2,"Good Information, Poor implementation","Pratima Raichur incorporates good practices and ideals in her book. Unfortunately she tends to ramble on about information that is not useful for following the Ayuverdic methods. Her ideas sounds good and the results that they allegedly produce sound terrific.These ideas and methods, however, go from the easy-to-do to the impossible. Some of the things that she suggests that you perform are time consuming and the products that she wants you to purchase are impossible to find.I would only recommend this book for people curious about Ayurveda, but not those individuals that truly want to live an Ayurvedic lifestyle."
1,"If you have sensitive skin, don't try the skin care!","I received this book in the mail and went straight to reading the skin care section. I already know I am Pitta (sensitive skin) so I read the skin care tips for Pitta. It listed all the ingredients you should use for that type. I went out to a natural foods store and bought everything. Well $70+ later, I did exactly what she said and had horrible results! My skin broke out in a rash! My skin turned red, burned, and developed red bumps everwhere. This wasn't after multiple uses - this was after 1 use after 5 minutes. I should have known this would happen as she says you should use orange peel, rosewater, rose oil and sandalwood oil - all of which aren't good for sensitive skin but for some reason I believed her. I figured with the great reviews and her owning a spa, her advice can't be wrong. Well it is. Her skin care strategy for sensitive skin is not appropriate - please be advised."
2,I read parts to my husband for a laugh,"I bought this book because I do believe that being healthy and physically and mentally in balance will make one more beautiful. I do believe that healthy food and and a diet tailored for your genetics, chemistry, and to correct for imbalances is beneficial as is relaxation techniques. But this book is not at all helpful with what it is supposed to do, which is help you tailor your diet and other regime to your unique needs. It categorizes and recommends things based on your answers to a rather ridiculous quiz that determines your elements and esoteric etcetera. I am embarassed for people thinking there is anything to it; it is to the point of being silly at times. I read parts to my husband for a laugh..."
1,Disappointed,"I thought I was ordering a Crescent wrench made in the USA. The one I received did not have a ""Made In USA"" stamp on the handle which I found odd. Then I noticed that the packaging displayed ""Made In China"".When did Crescent start having their wrenches made over in China? I don't mind paying extra for well built American tools, but this is criminal!"
3,"Dee Dee Warwick / ""The Collection""","For years I've had the vinyl single ""She Didn't Know (She Kept On Talking)"" b/w ""Make Love To Me"" on Atco Records. I love both songs, so I decided to purchase this CD. I wasn't too impressed with these bland recordings. Something just seems to be missing. Dee Dee lacked the soulfulness of her contemporaries Betty Everett, Mary Wells, her sister Dionne, her aunt Cissy Houston, & others."
3,fireplace book,"This is a good book for pictures of fireplaces, but I needed more information on what I now know are zero clearance fireplaces...and whether a large screen television can ever be placed above a zero clearance fireplace--info like that. So the book wasn't that great for my specific purposes."
2,Not an informative guide,"This book did not provide me with any valuable information with respect to fireplace design. I felt the book was vague and the majority of photographs were of traditional fireplaces. I was looking for contemporary designs and styles that would compliment different room types and configurations. This book is very predictable in text and in photos, nothing new here."
2,Not a single idea for me,"Like another reviewer said, The Fireplace Design Sourcebook by Melissa Cardona is a much better choice. Why he gave this book 5 stars anyway I can't figure out. I have over 20 postits marking pages in the other book and not a single one in this book. Not a single idea for the stone, mantle, or anything worth using. Way too much filler writing that didn't apply to anything, describing styles and types that are never applied in real world designs.""The Inglenook is a charmingly old-fashioned idea and the word itself is equally quaint. Ingle is a British word for..."" Well, you get the idea.I can see the point that this book has a good decorating focus, but I still don't think it is a great book even for that and if you are just looking for fireplace ideas I think you will find this lacking."
2,Never really gets going,"Some recordings grow on you over time; others diminish. This is one of the latter. On its first release in 1988, I thought this was one of the singularly great Mahler Fifths; now I think it's almost inert. A great interpretation, no matter how willful or idiosyncratic, has you convinced--even if only while listening to it--that there's no other way to play the piece. Here, you're all too aware of a ham-handed conductor exercising his prerogative and missing the point. The thread of the musical argument is lost amid overemphasized incidental details and preciously mannered phrasing. There ARE a couple of passages which stop you dead in your tracks--such as the lamenting cellos in the second movement, sounding almost like a human voice--but mostly it's the music which stops dead. Actually, it never starts. The CDs by Zander, Gatti, Inbal, Boulez and half a dozen others all convey this difficult work much more cohesively, engagingly and movingly."
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I decided to give this recording two stars, onlybecause I don't think any recording deserves less. I had read thereviews for this recording and saw they were quite good, so I decided to give it a shot. I thought his interpretations were horrible, and the orchestra did not play up to its potential. I have some very good recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic, and I do not doubt that they are an excelent orchestra, but this recording, well, it stinks. To cite some specific examples, the brass has quite a few intonation problems in the first novement, and they also do not play together (when they're supposed to) in one section (around 8-9 minutes through the movement). The third movement is way to slow. The tempo marking means ""not too slow"", but Lenny has the orchestra moving at a snails pace! I normally adore the fifth movement, but it was a disappointment. Again, Lenny's tempo's were too slow. I thought the balance of the orchestra as a whole was terrible as well."
3,Disappointing Adagietto,"I agree with others that this recording conveys all the intensity and fury one can possibly imagine. But tenderness and sweetness in many passages are poorly realized in Bernstein's hands thanks to the overpowering but unrefined orchestra playing. This flaw greatly undermines Adagietto, which comes across as one of the loveliest Mahler movements in the hands of Abbado, Karajan, Chailly, Sinopoli, and most surprisingly, Maazel - but not Bernstein and Vienna Phil (not one of my favorite orchestras).But I love Lenny's overstatements and emotionalism. I love his ""give-all-you-got"" approach. I just wish he had spent more time refining the tonal qualities of the orchestra, especially the strings."
5,A Mahler Fifth that Works,"One wonders how many times Leonard Bernstein conducted the Mahler 5th symphony in his lifetime. Even the most obscure recordings are rich in the pathos and beauty of this symphony. This recording dates back to 1990 with Bernstein conducting the venerable Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. As expected the sound is lush and velvety with just the right balance of the brass sections and solos with the sonorous strings. The Adagietto in this recording is for his listener the finest Bernstein ever preserved on CD. This is one recording of the beloved Mahler 5 that deserves a place in the collection of every Mahlerite - even if it is simply for this luminous Adagietto movement. Grady Harp, January 12"
5,Good basic faucet assembly.,This is a very basic faucet assembly that has a pleasing appearance. Installed in a sailing vessel galley and is working great.
1,two man tape measure,"This tape measure is a waste of time,money and effort.I own a half a dozen of these which I bought on a close-out,no returns or refunds.In just a few short weeks 4 of the six broke.That is,their locking mechanism broke,the tapes are still funtional,as long as you have someone to hold the other end.I wrote to the manufacturer,but have heard nothing from them,it's now been over 2 months.The other two tapes are hanging on my shop wall as souveniers and a reminder to never buy a product made by Lufkin again.Pure Junk."
5,So when is the movie?,"What more do you want? For a thriller with laughs, this is the book you need.I must say that David Terrenoire and I must share a lot in common. It seems as though this book was written for me. There's great dialogue, and a story that never lets up.And who couldn't love a leading character that loves the Big Lebowski.Now buy it, read it and recommend it."
4,enlightening review of the upcoming global food crisis,"""Outgrowing the Earth"" is another great contribution by Lester Brown. In ten concise chapters the author reviews the relationship between continuing human population growth and the finite land and water resources of the planet. I found the discussion of falling water tables especially interesting and important. I was also glad to see the increasing food needs of China as well as the potential for increasing food production in Brazil were both covered from several angles. There were also extensive endnotes and a decent index, both of which I found useful. In summary, this is another important and well-researched publication for anyone interested in issues of food security in these times of diminishing fuel reserves, rising temperatures, and falling water tables."
1,Insultingly bad and mis-titled,"This book starts out with several chapters on what to write a book about.... Huh? It's supposed to be about getting published, meaning you already wrote a book!! I knew something was already wrong here.... So I skipped to the part about actually trying to get published, i.e. contacting publishing companies. Want to know their advice to you? When sending a letter to potential publishers, don't send a letter that smells like cigarette smoke and don't misspell someone's name in the letter. Are you kidding me? This book is filled with insultingly obvious gems like those two. There's GOT to be a better book out there that doesn't waste the reader's time with needless information....."
4,Not sure,I bought these as stocking stuffers and the men have not really used them yet. I saw them after seeing the advertised in a magazine and thought they would be helpful when the men are working away from home and need to clean their hands after repairing equipment or working with seeds.
3,Workbook to go alongside the overpriced class,"I was disappointed in the book because it is associated with the writing courses, in NY, but you have to purchase the classes that are offered that cost over $100-$1000? per class per term, if there is a not a way to take the class than this book makes very little sense to most people."
5,Easy to read,This little book is filled with tips suggestions and exercises that a reader/writer at any age or level could appreciate.
3,Maddening,"When is the music world going to admit that this beloved artist is a colorless, unimaginative pianist. Too often we take stolid performancers as this and call them ""architects"". Why, because they make a piece hang together? Pollini is too unimaginative to take the risk of having something fall apart."
5,Not here yet,I am still waiting for this item it hasn't arrived yet and it is late and I am getting a little worried I haope all it was was lost in the mail
4,important and enlightening,"It is hard to think of anything more important or interesting than applying the truth of physics to everyday life. In this book, Rifkin efficiently dismantles the predominant/global capitalist economic paradigm with the simple, undeniable pillars of physics and thermodynamics. For the blind mice of the developed world - happily living in debt and consuming beyond their means and needs - physics is a forgotten high school annoyance. Rifkin's thesis quickly turns this annoyance into fear, and ultimately understanding, by reminding us that the modern developed world is indeed living on borrowed time and limited resources. Yes, the book becomes repetitive, but then again, Rifkin's point deserves repeating.Read the first 4-5 chapters of this book and change your perspective on capitalism and your own footprint on this planet..."
1,"Oh, dear . . .","Have we missed something here? Like maybe an actual course on thermodynamics. If we were to accept Rifkin's theory, then there would be no life on this planet. Life is an ordered system, how could it possibly evolve? What Rifkin overlooks is that the requirement of entropy always increasing applies only to CLOSED systems. The world is not a closed system, it operates in conjunction with the sun. The sun produces more than enough entropy so as to permit the entropy decline that defines the history of life on Earth."
2,provoking yet unaccurate,"It's a very challenging view of the world and how it works. It is written in a nice language, easy to follow. Unfortunately, the writer does not know his thermodynamics enough and makes quite unaccurate analogies, that could be interesting if they did not have the mark of Scientifism given by the improper use of the idea of Entropy.I have enjoyed other books written by Rifkin and it would be nice if he sticks to what he really knows about politics, without trying to get into fields that he does not know enough."
4,human responsibility,"Rifkin stresses the responsibility of the humans for their own survival and for life on planet in general, bringing in the question of faith and convenant of God and Man. Earth is not man-made but the conditions on it predominantly are. The book does not support the belief that ways out of energy crisis can be found through technological progress, molecular biology, genetic manipulations, not through just recycling and ecology as-is. It calls for turn in ways of life of modern civilisation in order to sustain itself into the future; more responsibility - less comodity & consumerism. Neither the science ( or the scientists for that matter) are the savers of the world and that's why this book is so unpopular with the scientists.This is a review of the man-made state on earth, for answers on how to solve entropy problems or as a matter of fact, study on entropy, look elsewhere."
1,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,"After reading the 40 plus reviews here, I think it's time someone outside the Hoff's family, or the people who work at his record company, had a say.This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, Germany owes a huge debt to this man. If it wasn't for him getting up on the Berlin wall to sing a song, it may have never been knocked down!"
1,"Hello, how old are you?!",I liked his music when I was 6 years old. Now that I'm 21 I can tell it isn't even music. It's corny...
5,"Holla, Hasselhoff.. holla","Let's face it, David Hasselhoff is beauty and David Hasselhoff is music. If it wouldn't be breaking a comandment, I would make idols of this man, place them in my dorm room, and worship them for hours on end. Screw Charolette Church, it is David Hasselhoff who has the voice of an angel. The man defines the human experience with his smooth and emotionaly charged lyrics. I am thoughly moved by his music, often times I burst into tears or start convulsing because of just how deeply I am moved by the mans's music. There is nothing in this world, not even my Malcom Jamal Werner action figure, that i value more than this CD of my David Hasselhoff. I implore everyone to enrich there lives and buy this CD. The world will be such a pretty place if we all keep a little Hasselhoff song in our hearts. David Hasselhoff rocks and looks darn good doing it. Holla."
4,Looking for awesome? YOU FOUND IT HERE.,"Now when you buy a Hasselhoff album, it's good to know that much of it won't be all that good. It's also good to know that there ALWAYS will be a few good songs that go BEYOND amazing. I'm thinking of the ONE-TWO punch of the title track and ""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness"": two wholly different songs, but snazzy each. The title track may be the best known Hassel-hit, due to it's Berlin Wall-destroying connotations, but ""Flying..."" is a sublime love ballad of equal power. Two songs of power, with some amazing ""building a castle out of honesty"" metaphors. Two other songs are great: ""Song of the Night"" is pretty sweet, and the opening track, ""Is Everybody Happy,"" is a delightful romp. The rest of the album is not too good, but that's why there's a skip button."
5,Praise the lord for his son is risen,"From the moment I switched on my gramophone to the second the album finished I was in heaven. David Hafflesnhaffle sent what can only be described as rhythmic funk juice flowing through my veins, which was followed shortly by sticky man-fat shooting forth from my one eyed trouser snake. It rocks like a bear in a chinese zoo.It is a shame the album did not contain the song Hot Shot City, as it is particularly good."
5,Tammy's right Hasselhoffs body is intoxicating,"I would like to back up the review by Tammy M. Todd and say she is 100 % correct in her review of both the cd and his body.And Tammy if you are reading this can you E-mail me so we can talk about his greatness,I DON'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS"
5,Rock solid,"Dropped dd-wrt on this guy and it's been up w/o issue ever since (about 2 month uptime). I have torrents running often as well as streaming content and web browsing w/o any lockup. If you do your research, I think you'll find this is the best consumer level router available. Thanks to Linksys for bringing the linux version back!"
5,So stable it's boring,"This was a no-brainer purchase: sets up in minutes, works out of the box for my XP workstation, Vista laptop, and MacBook. Took another couple of minutes to setup access key, access list, and some port-forwarding for BitTorrents and games. Been humming along for about a month not a single hiccup."
5,Great unit - buy the right antenna connections,"Using with DD-WRT firmware to act as a wi-fi repeater for the past 3 months. Works GREAT.If you want longer, higher-gain antennas, these work great:Alfa 9dBi SMA Screw-On Swivel Antenna for Linksyshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RV4AYQ/ref=oh_o01_s01_i00_detailsYou'll need THESE ADAPTERS:Alfa RP-TNC to RP-SMA Adapter - SMA Female To TNC Male Converterhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040R7QL0/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_detailsI just purchased another WRT54GL and will add specifics on the DD-WRT firmware upgrade when I complete it in a couple days."
5,Works great in a Bi-Level Home!,I live in a bi-level home and I have this router on the lower level. Works great in all areas of the home! Even streaming video works great!
5,"Excelent Router, rate is true","Excelent product, i owned for a week and the response and signal is flawless, the next week i'll change the firmware (that's the reason of bought it)"
4,Easy setup,"Router came today, setup very simple, had to shut down all power then reboot to get system working, now works fine, though signal not very strong in distant rooms."
5,A great open source router !,I love my Linksys WRT54GL. I run tomato open source firmware on it and I could not ask for a better home WLAN router.[...]
1,does not work with vista,"this product was ok for me because i was able to use it for regular internet purposes and network printing. the thing i first had issue with was that i had to change the default IP address because my dsl router was the same number. that was not the big problem for which i returned it. for some reason, this router worked well in macs and win7 OS computers, but i was not able to get an internet connection for my vista laptops. this proved to be a big issue for me because most of the people who come to my house have a laptop with windows vista installed, none of them were able access the internet. the were able to with an old belkin router. it seems that spi security settings are problematic with vista"
3,bad results,I had my IT guy install this since i was having trouble with dropped dsl service. I hand a similar unit from Linksys . It was not allowing my access to my Swann security system. We ended up putting the old link system back in and everything worked. I did replace the DSL modem which was the trouble in the first place but my new Linksys had issues.
2,Maybe I just have bad luck,"In the last 10 years, I have had multiple problems with Linksys routers. From my research, there seems to be no solution as no company builds a product that will work for any decent extended period of time and none of them seem to have decent support either. I guess I gotta just keep buying these things until I get one that works and then replace it months later when it screws up."
5,Very good router,I did have a setup problem related to the installation of a cable modem. Neither Linksys support or the cable company support could recognize the problem. I finally figured it out on my own and since then the router has worked perfectly.
3,"Decent, but not great","The setup on this was kind of a pain and it wouldn't let my wireless connections connect to the Internet without a lot of fiddling. When I was looking for solutions to the problem I found that it was a very common problem and that there are a lot of forum discussions dedicated to this exact thing. After a few hours I eventually got everything working, but the dang thing still needs to be reset every couple of weeks because it loses wireless connections. So, it's good when it works, but it certainly is not ""great""."
1,DO NOT buy if you have a Mac,"DO NOT buy this product if you have a Mac. There is no manual, only a CD that would not open on my Mac. I was able to rig up an old PC and start the ""Wizard"" which I did not find too helpful. Fortunately, a family member in another state has had considerable experience with wireless networks and by spending the better part of 3 hours on the phone, solving problems with the computer, DSL modem, and router, we eventually got it installed. It appears to work as it should, but the installation was a miserable experience. Had I known it would be this tiresome, I would have bought a Mac router in the first place for a few more $$."
1,"Horrible, will never buy linksys product ever again!","Well, good thing is it ""kinda"" work.Bad thing is it connect u to internet and if your playing a game or watching a movie, the router restart and you connection lost. Thats not all folks, if you use other wireless products like cellphone, you will instantly lose the connection. I was a fool to buy linksys router twice i'll never ever buy linksys product again."
1,Breaks Every 2 Months,"I had a LINKSYS Model: WRT54G V4, which I finally gave up on. Every 2 months or so, like clockwork, for the past year, the router has just stopped working. Then I go thru the whole route of calling Cox, then having them tell me to call Linksys... I had to pay a couple of times to a Linksys rep to fix it. The router worked ok the first couple years, but the last time I just had the Cox rep leave the Netgear WGR614 G router, it was $45. I thought I would have to buy new adapters, but the others work ok with it. It seems a little slower, like when I open email, but hey, if it WORKS that's the main thing. It's been only a week with the Netgear router, but so far so good."
5,This router works for us.,A friend recommended this router so we could have 2 computers hooked up instead of just one. It did the trick. We feel liberated not having to share a computer.
4,not one issue since install,The router performs as all the reviews I read. not one issue with this product. Great value for the money.
5,"So far, so good","Though not easy to set up (I had to call customer support), the Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router has been in use for about a month with no serious issues to report. The only snafu is if I forget to turn on my cable modem before my desktop boots up. If so, the cable modem & router get ""out of sync"" perhaps & then I have to shut down my computer & start again---turning on the modem before the desktop is completely booted up.Also, it's a good sized router, so if space is limited, that's a consideration."
1,Broken,"Does not power on anymore after about two or three weeks of use. No explanation, very unexpected. Dont know what to do about it"
5,Fits the bill,This router is very easy to set up. The signal is excellent and I've never had any problems with it.
5,Great Router!,"I've returned my WRT54G v8.0 ( the ones currently selling at retailers )and have replaced it with the WRT54GL.This linux-based ""GL"" version has RAM/FLASH: 16M/4M compared to the 8M/2M of the regular ""G"" version, which allows a selection of third party firmwares to be installed on it.I have installed dd-wrt v24 on this router ( was just a simple ""firmware update"" from the web interface ) and it has worked perfectly for a month now. Although the newest versions of dd-wrt allow a micro kernel to be installed on it, it suffers from the lack of RAM avail for it to work with.Would recommend it to anyone who is up to installing third party firmware and enjoy a more sophisticated interface/router."
4,good item; bad directions,"A good item, but who in the heck wrote the directions for installing this thing? I couldn't find a correct version online, in the box, or in the setup wizard. I had to call an IT friend of mine to help me make sense of what it was asking for - and he laughed at what I was reading to him from the screen. Once it's up, though, it seems all good. I really like having a virtual network in my home. It has really changed the way I do work on my laptop--mostly that I can do it from anywhere I want now. Oh, and the container this came in seemed to be quite recyclable, too."
1,2nd one - won't purchase another,"We have also had trouble with 2 of these routers, each after about 2 years of use. I don't know what the life of a router is, but I would hope longer than a couple of years. Both times we experienced freezing, and internet gradually got slower and slower, connectivity dropped many times, etc. When internet is hooked up directly to the modem, it runs fast. We almost bought a new computer thinking that was our issue. Glad we figured it out! I won't be buying another one like this."
5,10 stars!,"I was using a Belkin ""G"" router and it was giving me a download speed of 500 kbps...with an ethernet cable even. I stumbled upon some articles about this router and bought it hoping for the best.I now get a speed in excess of 5000 kbps! Wired or wireless!This router is excellent...HIGHLY recommended!And all this time I've been blaming ComCast! My bad."
3,Very difficult to set up,Finally had to call for installation. Disc would not load software to set up the network and password. Customer support was excellent and efficient. They indicated that they had problems with the discDoes work as promised but hard to set up
4,Does what its supposed to.,"I thought I was buying the wrt54gl, but when you buy used you rely on the seller knowing what they are selling. When I received it, it was the wrt54g. Seller made it right by refunding me some money and I couldn't be happier. Installation was simple, and now my wife and I can move around the house without worrying about internet connection, and we don't have to have wires coming into bed with us. Would definitely buy again in a heart beat."
3,"difficult to install, setup, and program it.","I bought it but it was very difficult to install, setup, and as mentioned as per CD and user guide for this model , it did not work properly and to secure internet I had to research and download software to make my internet secure. I would not advise to buy this product for anyone as there are better products available at similar price."
5,Wow!,This router has been the easiest to set up of any I have used. Great instructions and it is blazingly fast. I ordered it to be shipped over night and it arrived in 15 hours even though we live in the mountains. I'm VERY pleased.
2,Difficult and time consuming to setup,"The instructions say to run the CD setup first.The setup failed. I called tech support. You WILL NOT get a native english speaking person. This is not just a language issue. These people say phrases that do not make sense to an American or native english speaking person.The first thing the tech person told me was ""we don't use the setup CD""!! Well, why do the instructions tell you to install THE SOFTWARE FIRST?Very poor setup.And the wireless range is not adequate. Had to buy a Range Extender. Poor. Two devices just to get 100' range of wifi.PS and the support on the Range Extender was really poor. I spent 2 hours on the phone on my very cherished Saturday morning...oh wait, it's now afternoon.LINKSYS I hope you read these comments....you need to improve the setup and tech support process and range."
5,Wireless Router,"It works great, had to call Linksys people for help on how to set it up, it took some time and they were very good over the phone to set this up and how to secure it with a password."
5,I'm very happy with this Linksys product,"I am extremely happy with this product. I bought the Linksys 2.4 ghz wireless router at the same time that I bought my Netbook. I was amazed at how easy it was to set up. All I had to do was plug in the powercord, plug in the ether net cable and I was done. The Netbook found it and used it immediately, and I am very happy with the signal quality and lack of lag. I hooked it up in my bedroom, and when I am out in the living room, on another floor or out in the yard, the signal works just fine. The product also comes with a disc that allows you to set up security protocols and keep others from piggy backing off of your connection. That was easy to set up as well. I was also pleased that the unit ""runs cool"", and is not hot to the touch when in use like other brands sometimes are. I would recommend this wireless router to anyone looking for an easy to use, reliable wireless router."
5,Good Choice for DD-WRT,"I choose this device only because I can flash DD-WRT on it. I need it to become a repeater.Flash DD-WRT is very easy. Standard Version only.you need to flash mini or micro version first. reset to factory default and reboot. then flash standard version.I use MacBook Pro with Mac OS X 10.6, safari has some problem to access the web GUI and flash the firmware, firefox is OK to make everything done."
3,just okay range,my similar netgear router had to be restarted almost once a day. since i've gotten my linksys i've only had to restart twice so far and it's been a couple weeks. the range however is not as good as the netgear router.
4,Linksys observations,"My 3 yr old Linksys router used only with pc's worked reasonably well, but did crash from time to time. The real problem surfaced when I purchased a MAC notebook-the system crashed every time I opened the MAC. This problem has been resolved with the Linksys WRT54GL. The response is fast and has not crashed once since I got it. So, for someone looking for a router that is compatible with both pc's and MAC, this product has worked well for me."
1,Not so easy.,"This is not an easy set-up, especially if you want to use it to replace a router on an existing network, and especially if you want to add security. It comes with NO instructions. There is a set up disc, but by the tenth time it is checking your computer settings without saying why you will want to burn it because it will never stop. That's after it asks for all kinds of information, like you ISP address, something called a sub-mask, and so on, that you can find on the web not from Cisco. Now some things work, some don't, some say the settings are not compatible between the computer and the router, and so on. Maybe this is easy compared to other routers, but I suppose it is easy only for the very computer savvy and the people writing it is easy fall in to that category. It's like surgery is easy for a surgeon, but don't try this at home."
1,linksys,the worst router i've ever bought. When your on the internet it suddenly disconnects and I have to wait ages for it to come back on. If your playing video games online this is also a terrible router. It kicks you out in the middle of games due to connection issues. Do not buy this router
1,Failed in less than four months >>> What is the warranty?,I purchased this item at the end of September and it stopped working mid-January - about 3.5 months. The return policy is expired. What is the warrenty period on this?
5,Linksys WRT54GL Router ROCKS! Avoid installation CD,"This router puts out a VERY strong signal out of the box, has RP-TNC antenna connectors to change to higher gain antennas, and sets up easily WITHOUT the installation software CD. That installation software did NOT work for me, and broke existing network setups that I needed, and getting them working again was NOT easy. I bought this unit because it has two antennas for diversity, and the extra memory to support all versions of open source Linux software to enhance features; more on this, Google ""wifi planet DDWRT"" without quotes. I'm extremely happy with it."
2,Piece o' Crap,"This is my second wireless linksys router. I assumed the first one I had was set up incorrectly, so I decided to give it another chance.It's truly terrible. Internet connection goes out what seems like every two hours, if not more. Seems as though it has quite a difficult time transmitting signals."
5,"Comes with valuable, quality technical support","A friend who is more router savvy than I came by to help set this unit up, and after a couple hours of fiddling with options, we still couldn't get it to work.Luckily, this product comes with excellent phone support - after going through the set up step-by-step, the Linksys support tech was able to pinpoint that the problem was on my laptop, then provided a solution.Now my wireless network runs fine, and I'm very happy with this router's performance and the convenience it provides.***Update 3/18/11 - I needed to call Linksys again for additional tech support, and once again they patiently went above and beyond to help me solve an issue with my wireless network (product support is n/c for one year from date of purchase)."
4,Nice Wireless Router with good Price,Everything was as advertized. It would be helpful if the manual had some hints on what to do if you have an IP conflict between the router and your particular modem. Good product at a good price. Thumbs up!!!
5,Easy setup; Reliable performance,"This router was a no brainer as far as setup went - even to secure the network. This is the second home network I have set up with this router. the setup has been made easier than it was a few years ago. No reliability issues, either. I did not need the extra cable I purchased. The short one that comes with the router was long enough for my needs. A good buy."
3,Questionable quality control,"The router was easy to configure using the setup wizard, at least for basic configuration. If you want to go beyond that, you're pretty much on your own because there is no documentation provided with the device. The wireless range is plenty for the house I live in, and had no problem connecting to it with my HP laptop. However, two of the four switch ports don't work."
2,Failed after short time,"Worked well for a while then system slowed to a crawl. Removed router and everything was ok. I did not bother to try to get it to work. This is probably a solvable problem, but, I do not wish to spend the time to try. This may be a good product, but my experience with it was not good.Disclaimer: Reviewer holds stock in Cisco."
4,Excellent router,I was amazed at the ease of putting and plugging in the roiuter.so far it has worked well. Have not noted any slowing down from my airport.
3,Old Model,"Although this router is very popular, there are newer routers by Linksys available. Check out the E1200. My 9-year old Linksys router was dropping my connection from time to time and I couldn't update the firmware because Linksys no longer supported it, hence buying a current model will extend your router's life."
3,"It is OK,","It is OK, It disconnected a few times for a month and froze out twice, so I had to turn the power off and on.I don't know if this kind of products do this in general...Otherwise, it works good."
5,good product,I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.
5,Linksys,Had a Linksys for years so I stayed with it. This product is everything advertised and I will stick to this brand.
5,Very stable router,This is a very stable router that I have ever had. I love it and I recommend it to everyone.
4,Simple but strong,I purchased this router specifically to run the open source software dd-wrt. After following the setup directions it works awesome. Helpful hint - set channel to auto during setup. I was getting interference that I was unaware of until I changed channels
5,Review For Linkys-Cisco WRT54GL Router,"This item came in good state, arrive in the spected time and work in perfect form. Thanks Amazon for this router. I'm thanks to you for this amazing equipe."
3,Failed after 2 years & 4 months,"The LAN part worked great until the unit failed. The WLAN never achieved speeds even close to the claimed 54 Mbps. The receiving end computer's wireless adapter card reported a 54 Mbps connection rate but the internet download rate was only 1.5 Mbps to 4 Mbps (typically 2 Mbps). The LAN internet download rate, with Time Warner, is 15 to 30 Mbps. Both LAN & WLAN upload rates are 1 Mbps.Paid $68.95 and shipping was free. Purchased on 04-04-2008 directly from Amazon."
4,Using Tomato firmware reception is ok.,"I immediately replaced the firmware with tomato. I have tried several things to get the reception better outside the house, but i think there are just some dead spots. Overall works great. Had a hard time figuring out how to shut the thing down via the onboard button, it just kept rebooting even though the firmware said for it to shutdown. Even so great product, and so easy to modify the firmware, try tomato!"
5,"Excellent Stable Connection, would definitely recommend.","I had a harrowing time looking for a good wireless router to set up our wireless home network. We have 2 laptops. I had previously good experience with D-Link and so was leaning towards that. But I couldn't find any decent D-Link products within affordable range and nice reviews here on Amazon.So ultimately I went for this Linksys product after reading a lot of reviews here and spending hours on research; and despite reservations I had, this thing was pretty easy to set up and was a GO! in about 15 minutes. I followed all the steps as listed in its instruction brochure, selected DHCP server, configured settings from their router-address website and that was it! Its been a smooth sail ever since. I did get 24 mbps connection sometimes so I raised it from the floor level to about a TV-Stand's height and that resolved the issue.Its definitely a nice product and I would recommend it."
5,Great router,I've been owning this router for three months and it's been great. Stable and good signal. Nothing like cheap ones directly from Verizon.
4,Rock Solid Router,"I replaced a crash prone WRT54AG router with the WRT54GL. I was hesitant because I had so many problems with the other Linksys router. However after reading many rave reviews and the ability to flash a Linux based firmware I took a leap of faith. I installed the Tomato firmware and could not be happier. The router has never locked up and the signal strength is incredible. I can listen to streaming radio via my iPhone while mowing the lawn! If you want a rock solid, 3rd party firmware capable router look no further. Now only if they had an N version of this."
5,Great Product for the money !,"I am not a guy that understands much about computers. I was very pleased with the step by step instructions for the set up. It was a breeze. I also purchased the USB adapter for a reasonable price. I decided to stick with the same manufacturer to reduce complexity and to faciltate the ease of technical support if the need arises. I did have to make a call but it was only because it was something that I did incorrectly. Overall, I am please with the speed and low maintenance. I am only a basic user for e-mail and searching the net. I have two computers that are used by four people. It is nice to be able to have internet access on the secondary computer. I give the product a 9 out of 10."
4,good little router,"This is my second Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router - the first one served for a few years, died suddenly and needed to be replaced, so I bought another one."
1,thumbs down lynksis,"The set up process is simple but connection wise, it's not worth buying. Customer service is 50/50 and don't get nothing resolve."
1,Difficult,"after reading the positive reviews i thought i would have a positive experience with this product. Unfortunatly it didn't happen that way. I spent 1 week trying to connect it to my windows XP computer and it wouldn't do it. i called Lynksys and spent 2 hours on the phone with them rearranging my setting, connection and disconnecting. it was horrible. It's a 50-50 thing. maybe it'll work, or maybe it wont. just keep the box until you decide it does."
4,Works Fine,This router works fine. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that it did not provide configuration software for mac users.
1,Go with a different brand,"This router was easy to set up, and I get pretty good wireless signal throughout most of my 1000sq foot house and even outside my house, but seriously everyday I have to reset the router. I believe that my wireless telephones interfere with the routers wireless capability, and then I have to reset the router. If I dont, then the internet runs at like dial up speeds (super slow). There is a bunch of different ""channels"" that the router can use, but I tried all of them and they all were the same. This is my third LINKSYS router and I will not ever be coming back. I am going to try the buffalo series, I havent read too many bad reviews on them."
3,"Great piece, a real pita to set up.","EVERYBODY on the IT staff at work recommended this piece with the older 'flashable' system. After playing on ebay, used up pieces were within ten bux of new ones, so Amazon. It's been several weeks since install, but it took me MANY hours of fussing to get this thing to connect to a small-brand (earthlink) dsl server. 4th query to a Lynksis tech who knew the secret and another setup finally made it hook. So much for plug and play. I'm willing to blame oddball provider protocols, but this was enormously time consuming and frustrating. I dread the day if I ever have to go through that again after a crash."
1,crappy. avoid.,It often fails on establishing connection when I start my PC.It's nothing to do with my PC. Only rebooting the darn router will solve the darn issue. You can imagine how it becomes really annoying over times.My humble suggestion to miserable wrt54gl users: don't turn off your PC if you hate the trip to your router.
1,Simply impossible to configure,"For some people, this product will work fine but, given the configuration nightmare I've had with this thing for the last 6 months, I'd guess its about 50% of the users. I have a very deep understanding of networking internals and I have spent 6 hours with this device each time I changed something (bought a Tivo? 6 hours thanks to the router. Bought a Wii? 6 more hours futzing with the router). What garbage. This is my second wireless router and my second linksys router. Both were pretty much junk (although the old one was cheaper and I managed to beat 6 years out of it). Never, NEVER buy a Linksys router. They are legendary for being 'for advanced users' which is shorthand for 'they dont work' (again, I am an advanced user)."
1,"2 strikes, i'm done","Bought 2 of these last week and try to setup the first one successful.However, it will not do any good but just drops the connection every damn 3 minutes.Getting really frustrated,try out the second one which bought for a friend,and the result was amazing worse,setup feature seems fairly easy and got it done within 10 minutes.But again the ugly thing will not connect to the internet EVEN it says there is a connection at all time and no dropping occurs.I'm a bit broke with 2 trikes from Linksys which i've chosen them over other brands for years"
4,linksys wirelessrouter,"this is my first router and I couldn't be more pleased. It was a very straight forward set up. The range is excellent inside the house and even in the backyard. It works very well with my Comcast phone/internet modem. This was a big concern for me and I couldn't find anyone who mentioned this in a review. If you do have some difficulty with setup, you can download a trial version of ""Network Magic"" from the web. I used it to help encrypt my network and it was simple and effective. Excellent product at a great price."
2,Lousy customer service,Easily set up and after a month we have not had to reset at all. After almost 4 years the router started dropping the WIFI signal. The problem is the customer support. Rather than assisting me in making sure the router was bad he offers to sell me a service call and then if he can not fix it he will give me so much off the price of a new one (not of course the full price of the service call). Lousy customer service. I am changing my review from a 5 to a 2 just because of the cheesy way the product support behaved.
3,Linksys Wireless router,Has Cisco forgotten there's such a thing as an Apple computer? The setup CD was Windows format only. Useless on my Imac. Customer service apparently had no idea. Customer service requires a lot of patience as you must get through a lot of irrelevant questions to get to the problem. Why can't they just let you just ask your question and get to the issue? I got it set up without their help.
5,Great wifi range,"Easy installation, love the Cicso security features and great wireless range from up to 3 floors making this a great investment. Compatible with WEP, WPA and more additional wireless modes for new or old wifi devices. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Router,Before using this router I was using Belkin 54 G wireless router which was real pain. The connection used to drop quite often and the router had to be reset at least twice a week.On the other hand Linksys WRT54GL proved to a solid and reliable router.Installation was really easy. It's been close to six months since using this router and not even once it had to be reset. The browsing and download speeds are excellent. The router supports third party firmware such as Tomato or DD-WRT. These firmwares give you a host of options such as increasing the signal strength. Finding the channels on which other wireless networks in your range are operating and host of other functions.
3,Nice wired router - bad wireless router - worse customer support,"Solid wired router with nice feature set.Wireless portion of router goes down constantly for us. Most likely due to other networks in the area... couldn't figure out a setting that worked (tried everything). Tech support was fairly bad... no troubleshooting help, just wanted to reset it and when that didn't work tried to send us a replacement unit. When the replacement got here it was very worn out looking and was a much older model. Nightmare trying to get that straightened out!All in all ended up going with an Apple Airport Extreme and have not had issues with the wireless. Unfortunately, the Airport is almost 3x as expensive.This unit has some redeeming qualities and nice, simple features as a wired router -- but I wouldn't recommend it for its wireless ability."
2,Support 0,"Instructions incomplete - wrong, CD made changes to our PC without notice and in place unrelated. Took time to find out what it had done and fix. DO NOT LOAD CD unless your know what will happen. Took 2 hrs to get tech support that spoke understandardable english. Cisco/linksys has no USA english speaking support. Good luck if you buy a Linksys product."
3,Didn't Last long enough!,"I bought this last October 7th, it stopped working on September 29th, only has a 90 day warranty. These things are not as good as they used to be, the first one I had worked for 6 years, the cisco ones just are not right."
2,An ok router,"I've had this router for about three years now, it's worked great and it can support a lot of devices. I mainly use it for my ps3 and wii. The only problem that really irks me, is that Everytime there is an update for something on my ps3 or wii or our blu ray player, it disconnects in mid update and won't re connect unless I restart it. I don't know if mine is just old. Or it's this brand of router. I don't know much about routers or ip addresses or whatever but. I've been looking to get a new router that doesn't drop connection Everytime mynps3 or laptop is started"
1,Fine For First Two Weeks Then Problems,"Well, the first two weeks were fine but now internet connection is extremely slow via both wireless and ethernet and iTunes streams keep rebuffering(cutting out) every 5 seconds making iTunes streams unlistenable.When connecting my computer directly to my cable modem, internet is fast and ITunes is fine (no rebuffering). Just tried connecting a friend's old Netgear router to my computer and cable modem and both internet connection and iTunes streams are fine. So the problem has gotta be with this Linksys WRT54GL router. It's obviously gone bad.What a bummer! I'm returning this and will look for a better quality, more reliable router.I previously used a Linksys WRT54G that belonged to a house mate and had constant connection drop offs so when I read the 4 and 5 star reviews for the WRT54GL I expected router nirvana but, alas, no joy. How disappointing."
5,Best,"After researching Routers, this was the one most recommended and the price was affordable with free shipping. Will get it installed and know more if it is ."
5,This is a great router.,"This router is wonderful for those on a budget or those who just want a reliable wireless router without all the bells and whistles of the higher priced models. Set up was very easy and the instillation guide on the cd is very helpful if you are unfamiliar with the process. I was up and running in just a few minutes. This router has not dropped out on me once since I installed it over a month ago. I have never had a more reliable wireless router. To add to this, it is designed with the tinkerer (and Linux enthusiast) in mind and the operating software is easily replaced with other third party firmware. One popular choice is known as DD-WRT which you can find more info about here: [...]. I highly recommend this router to everyone."
5,It does what it is supposed to.,I bought this as a gift on the recommendation of my Computer God. It does what it is supposed to.
5,Great product,great for open air or secure wifi use it in an open wifi environment and my customers love the ability to have the access.
4,"Solid, dependable router","I purchased this unit to replace a five year old WRT54G that had started to fail - after many years of reliable service, the wifi side had started dropping connections several times each hour. The replacement unit dropped in place, and I was up and running again in minutes.Pros - very simple to use, solid and dependableCons - 802.11 a/g only, so I will have to upgrade to a more expensive 802.11 n unit at some point. The install CD didn't work with Windows 7 - it would get to the point where it should find the router to configure it, and fail to find anything. Luckily, manual configuration via the web browser is very easy, but a novice would struggle to configure this one"
2,It is a hassle,We have had to replace 3 in 1 year .It is a hassle to have to mail them back and sometime they gave me so much attitude in the customer service division...I went with Belkin and I have had no more replacement problems because it works right and doesn't go out every 3 months.
1,Wireless radio does not work,"I bought this router to install tomato on it and use it as a wireless router. Well guess what? wireless radio does not work at all. I have no idea what could be wrong, the product is clearly defective. I will try to get replacement of the product but since I installed tomato on it maybe they wont even replace it for me."
1,Lynksis...fine service if you speak Indian dialects,"Lynksis service starts off with lies. ""Richard"" answers the phone and when I ask if he's in India he says ""No, I am in New Jersey."" I had to go through 4 different agents before I could find one that I could understand...and then it was barely understand.They did a remote 'fix' and changed my program icons to represent Indian programs. When I found out when they'd done and then called to ask them to remove the programs they tried to tell me that moving the icons into the trash removed the programs. It took me 3 hours on the phone with them to get them to remove their programs and restore my original programs to me.In all my years of dealing with computers and issues, I have never had worse service. I would never use a Lynksis program again. I am not a dilitant with computers. I started doing computer installations in businesses way back in 1968."
1,Mac compatible?,"We just bought this router, but we are Mac users and it only comes with a PC disc. A call to customer service didn't help.Can this be set up with a Mac?"
2,infant mortality,"Worked great for a month. Then I couldn't send e-mail from Outlook. Internet worked fine, as did incoming e-mail. A real time consuming troubleshoot as the router itself was low on the list of likely suspects. Changing to an old Buffalo router cured the problem. Have yet to try collecting on the warranty but not looking forward to it."
4,Just works fine,"I read a lot of nice reviews about this wireless router and both my brothers who are IT experts recommended this to me and I am happy with my choice.Actually I thought I might need to tweak things on it and as it has a Linux on it I thought it would be possible to reinstall the OS and replace it with a more flexible thing but I found out that at least for now I don't need to change it, almost everything I need is available there. I should say that it does not have good reports on bandwidth usage and these sort of things but I can leave with that."
4,GOOD SOLID ROUTER,"I HAVE BOUGHT 3 OTHER OF THESE ROUTERS FOR USE IN DIFFERENT LOCALES. ALWAYS WORKS WELL AND EASILY PROGRAMMED. GOOD PERFORMANCE.BUT...OCCASIONALLY LOSES SYNC WITH MODEM AND REQUIRES REBOOTING. INFREQUENT. NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT DOES DOWN THEM A STAR.SEEMS TO ME TO BE GOOD COVERAGE FOR 30 mw OUTPUT; IN MY HOUSE, ABOUT 60 FT FOR 80-100 % STRENGTH. THIS IS WHY I HAVE BOUGHT 4 OF THEM."
4,Easy,The installation of this product was simple and very easy. A data cable and the electrical plug is included in package. Quality product.
3,Expected setup to be easier,"I set this aside to set up at a later date. Installation was more confusing than I expected it to be. Hopefully, when I have more time, I can get it to work."
4,"Great functions & features, but the product title is wrong","It's misleading to say ""Compatible with Linux"" - it should say ""upgradeable firmware"" to let people know this is the one you can enhance the firmware with linux-based code."
5,This workhorse has provided years of loyal service,"With the ever increasing demand for WiFI, I've been on the fence to upgrade my WRT54GL to the ""wireless N"" standard. At this time (Dec of 2011), I can't justify this because this router just keeps on tickin'! When I bought this in 2003, this router only served 1 laptop. Now, I've got 4 laptops, 2 RoKu devices, 1 Wii, and 4 android devices (2 phones and 2 tablets) all using this signal. It has occasional hiccups where I have to reset it, but other than that, it's pretty reliable. It's in my basement, and I'm able to get communication when my devices are upstairs. I give this 5-stars simply for the fact that it's still a good product after 8 years, which is very rare in this day and age when technology lasts only 3 years tops."
1,"Horrible Tech Support, Strange Connection","I've been using this router for about 2 years and every once in a while it will absolutely refuse to connect to the internet, even though all the lights are on. About 5 hours later it will spontaneously work again. This is clearly the router and not the internet service, because the internet service works fine if the router is disconnected from between the modem and computer, you just can't use it with any laptops for a while. Today I installed a new modem, and was incredibly annoyed to find that the router would not connect to the internet. I called the tech support line, was told by a difficult to understand agent that I would have to pay $30 as I've had the router more than a year. An hour later the router spontaneously began working again. Even if I was able to put up with the random lack of connection every few months, I would never recommend this product because of the rude and expensive Technical support."
1,Worked for 5 months.... then it died,"I ordered this router in January 2010 from Amazon to use for my Wii and laptop. It worked fine for about 5 months; then it started having connectivity issues. Throughout the month of May it lost connection 15 times per day. In June, it stopped connecting completely."
1,An excellent router if Amazon doesn't send a returned one,"I have purchased and installed dozens of these and similar Linksys routers from other vendors. All were perfect out of the box until this one that I got from Amazon.This last one was for a client who needed it ASAP.Unfortunately, I have egg on my face and an unhappy client who thinks I charged him for a used device. I'm out hours of time plus expense of buying a replacement elsewhere, , because not only is it defective (wired connections don't work at all), but it already had a wireless network named ""Murphys"" installed on it. Obviously, someone had sent it back and Amazon just re-boxed it and resold it to ME.There are not enough words, either polite or impolite, to express my annoyance, frustration and utter astonishment that Amazon would do such a thing.After years of being a happy, satisfied customer, I am beginning to wonder.After I send it back, will they just gleefully saddle yet another unsuspecting customer with this thing?"
3,Good product but you had better be wireless router saavy.,Plenty of pc experience building and repair. Little knowledge of routers. Suggest you better be saavy about routers before trying this. The auto set-up would not work. Even after re re rereading notes had to call Cisco. This is the bright spot. They know their product and in about 15 minutes had me up and running. Probably would still have trouble goingback and doing this solo. Guess to old for this stuff.
5,great router,I like this router because it works better than most when using with a wifi wireless G amplifier to extend range.
5,An excellent component ! ! !,"This should be the standard for all wireless/wired routers now, easy to setup, has a hardware firewall for the WAN side and always works as it should."
3,Nice all-round wireless router...,Decent signal strength and options. Not as nice as my personal router but this one is significantly cheaper and gets the job done.Also has the option of having WW-DRT loaded onto it to make it even more powerful which is a definite plus.
1,Terrihble product,This router has been a problem since day one. Disconnects every two or three days and I have to unplug it and replug to get it working. I ordered because of the good review.
3,"Reasonably priced, but issues with connections.","I bought this for a high rise condo building. The range on this is less than desirable. I get maybe 3 walls and a total of 20 feet for the range. I've also had issues where devices take forever to connect to the internet via this router, or lose their connection randomly.This router is probably okay for a small apartment, but I'd spend a little more if you have anything bigger."
1,outdated router - returning it - bad choice,Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux)I bought this router because of positive reviews on amazon. It came with a CD which would not work on a MAC.I called cicso linksys and was told this model hasnt been made in years. For not much more money I am buyinga much newer model.
1,"After installation, It works just two days!!","I returned this router. because It works just two days, after that I failed connection. I tried reinstall several times, but I got same problem. It was fine just two days!!"
1,Ungodly frustrating - just like other Cisco/Linsys products,"Stay far away.I support computer operations for a living.Running XP Pro, this device either cannot be configured to function, was defective, or is so difficult to configure that the man-hours aren't worth it.Don't waste your time.I tried a normal, quick install that would work on pretty much any wireless device, and it failed.Then, I followed, word-for-word, stap-for-step, every instruction in the manual. Fail after Fail.In my experience, this is pretty consistent with my experience with Cisco/Linksys devices across the board - with the exception that I could not make this one work.Seriously - it's not worth the aggravation. Check the Internet, complaints like mine are everywhere."
1,Broke within a year,"I had purchased this router for my new apartment based on all the positive reviews. But at about the year mark, the router just stopped working. I called Linksys and they said it was defective and would replace it. It sucked, but at least Linksys was willing to help me out.Fast forward another year and the same problem started happening again. I called them up and basically, the router is defective again.Now, I'm not sure if they repaired my router the first time or sent me a new one. But in either case, both routers only worked for less then a year before failing.Instead of offering me a replacement, they offered to sell me another router. Thanks, but I don't think I'll be buying another Linksys or Cisco (same company) router again."
4,Reliable,"this is my 3rd one of these. they work great for years and need very little maintenance if any. plug in, set up and forget it."
1,Reset button does not work.,"I got India customer service over the weekend. They insisted on going through my computer remotely and insisted on selling me an expensive technical service. On Monday, I got American customer service and they told me that the reset button did not work, so I am returning it."
5,One of the better routers,"This is an older but tried Linksys router model and it works well. It allows users to install their own software (DD-WRT), but I use it as is and it works fine."
5,Liksys Wireless Router,"The wireless router works fine (as expected). I received it in a timely manner. It was easy to install. I was able to access the Internet in no time. This Linksys router perfectly compliments my Linksys wireless adapter. In conclusion, I am a satisfied customer."
3,Wireless does not work after 8 months,"Generally, it worked well. I bought it because I saw it got good overall reviews from Amazon, and it supported Linux.After 8 months, the wireless stopped working -- my laptop could not even connect to the router through wireless. The router is still within warranty. But since I installed tomato firmware, the custom service told me it voided the warranty."
4,SETUP INFO,"The router we recently purchased does accomplish it's job well, however, the install software preformed less than satisfactory. This should not dissuade you from purchasing this product, because here are some hints in setting it up: 1st, hook it up. If you don't know how to do this you may want to review the install disk. 2nd, open the command prompt. This can be achieved on a PC by clicking of the start button, then run, then type in cmd and click enter. Next, make sure your router is connected to your computer, then type in ipconfig. Take the top set of numbers, i.e. 165.354.16, into your web browser. Finally, customize your settings. This does certainly work for XP, however I am not sure if this method will work with Vista, or windows 7. First of all however, you should try the install disk, you may have better luck than I did."
4,Paco Lozano,"The Cisco-Linksys router is great, if your not happy with it the you will have no problem if you decide to return it. Over all I was happy with the purchase."
4,WRT54GL: what I think,"This is a very good router. Very reliable. If you want to beef it up with the latest firmware upgrade like Tibor etc.. this is the one you should get with 4MB of flash memory. The only downside is, sometimes you have to recycle power if you experience slowness in loading web pages. I guess the router gets saturated over long period of use and when it's powered on 24/7."
1,Do not buy this router.,"This is a terrible piece of junk. I purchased the router 2 months ago and it's given me too much grief. Each time I've attempted to waste hours of my day trying to explain to the online tech support folks that a) I'm not an idiot and I know how to install this router. b) asking me question after question that leads to the same result. c) them asking me to try to set it up again and me explaining that if I do that, we will lose OUR connection because the only way I'm connected to the internet is through a hard-wire at the moment.Please do not waste your time with this modem. It is junk. Buy a more reliable brand. Linksys support is weak and unhelpful. The modem is cheaply made.All I wanted to do was to get a replacement. They make it VERY difficult. In the end, I just threw it away and bought one made by NETGEAR. It works fine"
2,Price,"Amazon has INCREASED the price of this router from $54.95.Amazon.com items (Sold by Amazon.com, LLC):1 Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wire... $54.95"
3,Set up is awful!,"The product is great but incredibly difficult to install. I spent about twohours with the Linksys support people trying to install it, at theconclusion of which they had to take over my lap top by remote to do so.Furthermore, they charged me $9.99 to do so!!!! Will not buy anotherLinksys product."
1,"Router Company: ""RouterwareZ""","Ladies & Gentlemen,Purchased this router through RouterwareZ. This unit began to progressively malfunction, to the point, where it continued to reset a cable modem to the point where the cable modem could not reset fully - which disabled the consumer to use of any phone and internet. Routerware sent the unit with generic firmware installed - which we believe to be the source of the problem. An e-mail was sent to their ""technical support"" department. We recieved a short, blunt e-mail, practically ignoring our case - claiming that everything was fine, and that there was nothing they could or would do. Even though the 30 day warranty for returns passed, and they offered no customer or technical support after the 30 day warranty.Amazon - if you are reading this - then know - that RouterwareZ believes that the customer is only right if they are in their warranty. In my opinion, nobody should buy from the company - ""RouterwareZ"" or buy reconditioned items - period."
4,No problem w/product but encountered a minor issue during set-up,"No problems with this product. Hooked it up to a laptop & a PS3 and everything works fine. The only trouble I had setting up the network (desktop) was my lousy firewall system provided to me by Time Warner cable (Computer Assoc: EZ Firewall/True Vector). In order for the laptop to access the network, I had to access the Firewall control center and entered the ip address of the laptop as a 'trusted zone'. Admittedly, this took a couple hrs to figure out but overall, I am pleased with the way things worked out."
2,Very annoying router,"I bought this to replace a router of another brand that died after 2 years. This was a hassle to set up, requiring that I search out an alternate method of set-up by searching through multiple pages on cisco's website since the accompanying disk did not have the proper support for my system. If I weren't capable of following instructions, I would have given up after popping the installation CDROM in my computer. Now, every now and then the router and the cable modem don't get along and even when the cable modem is on correctly, I have to reset both to get my computer to recognize that I have more than a local network connection. Goofy stuff like that only happened previously when I had a power outage. Now I can walk away from my computer and find this scenario at least 3 times a week. I have to move in the near future and really have no problem tossing this router and getting a more user friendly version."
1,Fails every couple months,"This product seems just fine, at first. The problem is that it regularly fails. The IP address mysteriously changes, and our computers can no longer access the wireless network even though they pick up a wireless signal. Although the customer service staff are friendly and knowledgeable, it takes 40 to 60 minutes on the phone to get it working again. This happens every two or three months. Eventually we knew the process by heart, but our customer service warranty expired, so now we can't access customer service without paying a fee, even though the problem is with the product itself and not our misunderstanding or misuse of it. If you buy this product, in the end you might just end up like us: stuck with a wireless router that sends out a signal that our computers CANNOT LINK SYSTEMS to!"
2,Good for a while,I used this for about a year. Then it started going bad. would work for a few hours then I would have to reset it. Now it is totaly dead. Was good for the first year but I guess I expet a router to last for more than a year.
4,Manaul/catalog missing from the box???,Wireless works very fine. Easy to configure and quick to use.But Amazon didnt sent any invoice and surprisingly there was no manual in the box. I had to download the maual from linksys website. Thats very strange...
3,Functional,"Installation would appear to be a cinch. Insert the CD and follow the instructions. The unit didn't work per the screen instructions, but it did manage to get itself working. It works fine. I use it to drive my desk top PC directly as well as provide a wireless interface to my laptop PC. If my laptop goes into the ""sleep"" mode, I need to re-start it to establish a LAN connection. Otherwise it works OK."
4,a good router,"Im verry happy with his item, works verry good , its nice, and easy the install, have no problems!!1 , good idea !!!"
1,TOILET,"I will never throw away my money on Linksys again. Overpriced with marginal signal range. Every router I have owned from Linksys magically quits working one year after the warranty expires. In order to get it working again you have to call their customer service department whcih charges you $40 to walk you through the set up again. Even though their CS is efficient in getting your router back up and running, it will not only cost you money, it will cost you time because you will be on the phone for hours, these people are like monkeys on drugs or foreign robots! Yes Comcast is overpriced but they were able to supply me with a router with better range and faster speeds for $10. Plus they offer free support on the router for as long as I have my internet through them. My last Linksys router made it to the garbage but not before I beat the living $^*#%^& out of it with a hammer! If I could give this ZERO stars I would but I guess the lowest you can go is ONE star."
2,Waste of time trying to run the setup disk on Mac,I installed this router yesterday. The installation -after I realized that the setup disk is for the Windows only-took 5 minutes and the router is working fine. I find it totally unacceptable however that it does not say anywhere in the package that the setup disk does not work for Mac. I wasted a lot of time before finally going to the linksys site and finding this info there.
4,Linksys WRT54GL - great router for open source firmware!,"I have owned several Linksys routers over the years, including a WRT54G of the same shape as this GL, and two of the newer WRT54Gs with the integrated antennae. This is a great product, as it boasts a little more RAM than its newer counterparts, and a larger flash memory. This is great if you have a lot of people wanting to use the connection, as it seems to cope better with a larger number of ip connections.I use open source firmware (dd-wrt) and this router is a great companion for it. It is very stable, even when running as a VPN client.I also use the router with aftermarket antennae, with the standard antennae the reception is fine, but being able to add external antennae is great if you need extra range.Overall a great product - would definitely purchase another one of these, and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid router at a good price, and especially to anyone looking to try open source or third party firmware."
1,Let me down,"I had a high trust in linksys routers as my previous one worked well for 5 years w/o a glitch. This one was bought half a year ago and broke down recently, it either has no warranty or it is extremely hard to find the information. It is probably not worth fixing."
1,No Good,"I just received my Linksys wireless router today. The Set Up Wizard CD will not play on my eeepc running Ubuntu 9.10 and Puppeee Linux. I found some written instructions on the web and a few youtube videos. I followed them to a T and nothing works. I get no hardwire etho connection, I get no wlan connection.The product page for this router clearly states that it is Linux compatible. Not so if the set up CD won't even play.A waste of my money and time."
5,AWESOME Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G BB Router.,"After a long search my son (12 yr old) recommended this and bought the same. Cisco's automated installation steps are easy to follow and is very fast. Connected Wii to the network without any issues. Strong wireless signal without any special antenna links Wii to Internet. Wii is located in the basement, while the desktop is on the first floor library. Basement steel beams/other lines etc. seems to not matter at all. Fast and works great. Only regret is I should have done this sooner."
2,reinstall,"Our first Linksys stopped working after a winter power outage, as well did our neighbors. when we got the replacement we were unable to connect to the listed(168.) url. the install disk provided was usless.we have DSL internet which works fine but we needed this for our wireless laptops.It took me two week of entering and reentering the prividors gateway and all the other numbers.now i finally have wireless what a PINTA if it ever stops working i sure as hell wont buy another one."
1,Randomly resets itself,"I am now on my third iteration of this router.We had one that worked perfectly, for many years, until it got fried in a power surge (that also took out two computers, and other electronics). Since it had worked so perfectly, we replaced it with the same model (purchased in May 2011). The new one was flaky from the start - it would randomly reset itself to factory settings, leaving our wireless network unsecured. That one finally bricked itself - fortunately while still under warranty. The latest replacement is only a few weeks old, but is already exhibiting the same symptoms of resetting itself to factory settings. I cannot risk leaving my network unsecured, so the router will have to be replaced by a new brand."
1,Very disapointing,"This was supposed to be an upgrade on an older CIsco-Linksys. It actually performed worse than the older model. It routinely lost connection, and constantly needed reset. Then this week it spontaneously resets to it's defaults. My named secure network is gone leaving a generic Linksys UNsecure network. And now it's too late to return it. Not good. I don't think Cisco-Linksys will be getting my business again any time soon."
4,router guide,"The only downfall to this router was that I had trouble hooking it to my internet, otherwise I couldn't be more pleased with this product."
3,Just dont ever update the firmware,Owned a 54G for several years and it worked fine. THen I tried to set up the Access Restrictions to keep the kids off the internet after 9pm. Nice set of options for multiple sets of access restrictions except for one thing. They didnt actually function. Cisco/Linksys web site said to update the firmware to fix this. Very carefully flashed new firmware (I'm a system software engineer). Popup message said Firmware Update COmpleted. My router is now a useless brick. Sigh... Had to go buy a new NetGear router.
2,Not what I expected,"This router is outdated by about 5 years, though the vendor did accept the return, I would not recommend this product. With today's technology changing so fast, this router was difficult to set up and not powerful enough to run the wireless components I needed it to. Returned and went with ""net gear"", easy to load, no cd to install, just plug it in and type a password."
2,Doesn't work well with 2 Xboxes in house,"This is a good router for the internet and playing XBOX.Do not try using 2 XBOXES Live and play the same game with a friend in your house. If you plug an ethernet cable into the back of this router from your Xbox and run the other XBOX on the Wifi itself, it's horrible. It will kick you off XBOX Live on both consoles."
4,good but old router,I've had this router for about five years now. Wireless G is out dated. My router is still functioning after five years but it was time for an upgrade to wireless N. For the same price you can own a newly updated router.
3,Fairly Average router,"Expected more from Linksys; used in a two bedroom apartment and could not pick up a signal at the other end of the apartment. ( Fairly average size NYC apartment). Returned it and bought a Netgear router which worked much better. I'd say if you will be gaming or streaming movies in a decent size building, this might not be for you."
5,"Great Product, no issues.",I have never had issues with linksys stuff. This is my 3rd or 4th router I have bought of theirs and I don't see a reason to ever buy a different brand.
3,Linksys WRT54GL Review,"Not too impressed. Whenver I enable security my bandwidth drops from 2.x MB/s to around 500 KB/s. Highly unacceptable. Not sure what the deal is but I don't have the time to investigate, so we're running w/ no security enabled."
5,Great after lengthy search,"I have DSL from windstream. It took me several frustrating failed setup tries to find out that I had to 'bridge' my DSL modem first. After another lengthy search the bridging on the windstream support webpage was easy. No panic, after the bridging the DSL modem doesn't work anymore on it's own and the computer will complain with warnings. After (then easy) installation of the linksys router everything works perfectly. The DSL didn't crash even once since the installation! Without router we had to pull the power at least once a day. We are using the liksys router with 3 labtops (one with Vista) sometimes all at the same time. Great! Just wished for a handbook."
4,Good Router,"Worked effortlessly right out of the box. Runs two laptops, a smart phone, a Kindle Fire and a Roku with no problem. And that's on a 2.5 mps DSL connection."
1,Stopped working in a year,This router was good for a year but stopped working after that. Not worth it for the money I spent.
4,Great Firewall For A Beginner,This is a great firewall especially for the novice or non-technical person. I am quite experienced with setting these up and it can be a bit daunting for a beginner. The included CD does the setup automatically which I found annoying but is great for anyone who doesn't know what they're doing. The configuration was done on a Windows PC so I don't know how the automatic configuration works on a Mac. The modem was a Comcast telephone modem and the user was adding internet and the automatic configuration was not bothered by that. The only thing wrong is the wireless encryption is only 128-bit and not the more updated 256. The wireless works quite well with the router set up in the basement of the house you get an excellent signal on a Dell laptop running Vista. This was recommended to me as being a reliable router that would last a long time which is why I purchased it for the user.
1,DISCONTINUED! Do not buy this!,"I set this up with the included software and was connected to wifi in about 10 minutes. The problem was, now my computer which was connected to the router would not connect to the internet. I then called Cisco tech support. I spent 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get this up and running. We did get it up and running after 2 hours but then after an hour, I lost my wifi connection. I returned this because I don't have another 2 hours to waste on the phone with them. During the conversation, the rep was surprised to hear that Amazon was selling this model. It has been DISONTINUED FOR 2 YEARS! I looked back and the good reviews I had read before purchasing were from 2007. Do not waste your time on this model!"
5,great product,I've owned other cisco wireless routers and they seem to last my last one only died cause it got cooked from a lightning strike other wise I don't think I'd need a new one. they work great and are easy to set up just load the disk and follow the directions. make sure to change the password it comes with but if you forget your the original password will work and get you back in it. mine is so long i sometimes forget it. would recommend them to anyone great product unless your house gets hit by lightning
3,Works most of the time,"I am constantly online and this router will lose connection sometimes. I need a router that will keep me constantly connected. I updated the firmware, checked the channel and I still lose connection. If you are online 50% of the Time this will be fine. Anything more and you will get hiccups in your connection."
3,Requires daily rebooting,"Pros -Very easy to installPowerful WiFi signal works 200 feet away with no problemCon -Like other have mentioned, I too have to reboot mine daily. Internet speed a few minutes ago was 0.2mbs. After rebooting 1.3mbs (verizon DSL)I actually bought a cheap lamp timer that reboots it twice a day."
5,Great to use with DD-WRT firmware,"Excellent product I bought this model specifically for the Linux capabilities and installed the firmware from DD-WRT, best router you can buy for the money with this firmware installed it is really stable and has many advanced features."
1,No more Linksys,"Had great luck with Linksys in the past. But, I can't get more than a couple of weeks out of this box before it needs to be reset...which, of course, wipes out all your configuration settings. At first I thought it was just the WiFi connection, because I use that more frequently than wired. But, I've discovered that the wired ports stop working, as well. Reset the router....zingo... it starts working again....for a few hours to 2 weeks. I am running the latest firmware offered by Cisco/Linksys. I'm shopping for another brand."
1,Avoid this one,"This router failed shortly after I received it. It was difficult to set-up/configure and was very user unfriendly with a DSL internet connection. Linksys wouldn't honor the warranty. When I got ahold of tech support (somewhere overseas) they were uncooperative and eventually hung up on me. So, in summary, a defective product and terrible customer service."
5,Great wireless router and great service !,I have been using Linksys wireless router since last 5 years. I have upgraded from my old one (which is still in excellent working condition) to the current WRT54GL which is more powerful version. I had to call the Linksys customer care as one of my laptops was not connecting wireless. The Linksys customer care personal made me walk through different troubleshooting steps patiently for more than an hour and finally got it fixed !! (the internet cable guy has changed my laptop MAC IP auto find settings :()Its been 2 months now and it works great. I use three different laptops at home and they all connect at the same time at one point or other (my wife and kid use at same time) and still give a seamless connectivity. Great product and great service !!
2,Needs to be restarted a lot!,"I had to return the first one I bought because it quit working after 5 days! I exchanged it for another one and this one is still working, but needs to be unplugged and plugged back in and/or restarted at least 2-3 times/week. I'm not sure if that's normal for routers because this is my first one, but it seems excessive. I bought it for my laptop, but mostly for my smartphone."
1,"Do not buy this router, they no longer support it.","Although this router served me well for years, they simply stopped supporting it altogether. They haven't updated the firmware for years and its pretty much useless now. The new version of this also has hardwired antenna so the all-important replacement antenna won't work with it. I had to purchase a new router. I recommend a Cradlepoint."
4,A bit dated,"This popular reliable upgradeable router lacks the memory, speed and performance of other routers. Compare to wireless-n routers that have upgradeable firmware supported by third-parties instead."
1,Already failed...less than a month.,"First wireless router that I've ever had that just doesn't work. Constant errors, and disconnects....very unstable. In the business environment I use this in, it is totally unacceptable. Went back to my old router which doesn't have the range I'd like, but it's stable."
3,being routed by my router!,Not so plug and play to use as I anticipated it would be. Still don't have it up and running. Problem may be with AT&T dsl? Instructions are a bit vague probably figureing it would be plug and play.
4,"Ok for our use in house, but distance from source causes problems.","Ok for our use in the house, but distance from source causes problems. It's ok for the value would recamend."
5,Linksys Tech Support,"Today I had the most pleasant experience with Lynksys tech support to diagnose and repair my wireless router connection. These folks are very clear, concise, patient and quite thorough.I highly recommend them even if you are outside of warranty and have to pay a small amount. It's worth it."
5,WRT54GL is the BEST!,"I have purchased over 260 WRT54GL routers within the last 4 years and I can say proudly: no returns and all our customers are perfectly satisfied. We sell them with the 7dBi Linksys antenna and installed DD-WRT firmware, carry up the Tx power to 245mW and everyone is happy! Very solid router."
2,Stopped working 1 month after the warranty ended.,"This router worked well for the first 8 months, then all of a sudden the saved settings started to disappear at random intervals. Finally 13 moths after the purchase date the router stopped working altogether."
4,Easy to set-up,"Got this for my parents. Easy to install. Easy to modify settings. If you have used a Linksys router in the past, this one's interface will be very familiar. So far seems to be working reliably. No complaints."
3,Bricked it with its own firmware,"I bricked this thing upgrading it from v8 with its own firmware .bin file to 8.00.7. Maybe I did something wrong, maybe I was supposed to stage it through other upgrades first. But it's a total brick now, won't ping, the power light won't stop flashing, there is no ""ping window"" before the firmware loads, its been reduced to a glorified switch.The websites that cover this issue told me I need to crack it open and start shorting pins. I junked it. Sorry, already wasted too much time with this for a cheap router.Verdict: I'll still buy another one, because it worked right out of the box. I like this router, it's easy to set up, it may drop connections here and there, but I'll never try to flash one again. Especially since I didn't even need the upgraded features."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT...,This is the worse product I ever bought at Amazon.com. I am so happy with whatever I ordered before but this one is a total disaster. After a week of trying to set the router up with the High Speed Internet modern I have with Verizon... I still cannot connect it. I spent hours with the technicians from Verizon and Cisco to try to make it connect... still not. I even brought an IT technician from my work and he couldn't figure it out. The set up seems simple at first but it is a total nightmare! Because the guide only tells you half of what you need to do... it is like pages are completely missing!Unfortunately I cannot return it because I had waited more than a month to connect it. I was waiting to switch my internet provider before I do so and I was trusting Cisco.I would suggest that you find a new product but not this one... Please!
2,Hard to set up; keeps dropping connection,"One would have thought that by time, most wireless routers would be plug and play for the simplest configuration.All we have is two laptops that need to have a wireless connection. Yet, the set-up took several hours. The instructions are incomplete and confusing. And then, it asks for information that was not required when I had set up my previous router (e.g. type of DSL connection, userid with ISP, password, etc...info I hadn't used in years). Even after all this, and upgrading the firmware, the wireless connnectivity still keeps dropping frequently.All in all, I would say for those of you who are not interested in the Linux compatability and are looking for a simple wireless router with good range and stability of connection - STAY AWAY from this one. If I had bought this from a store, I would have taken it back in a day."
2,Their Best So Far!,"worth the upgrade? probably. a perfect router? not even close.Out of the box:A great router for every day users, I am sure. For bittorrent and other high powered users, this still doesn't cut it. It handles massive amounts of connections far far better than previous linksys routers, but still no where near perfect, I can squeeze about 300 simultaneous connections out of this thing before it barfs - that's about 3 times the previous linksys routers I've used, but still not acceptable in my books.-Edit-My poor review had 1 out of 5 votes for being helpful, so i felt the need to add this section, which I thought went without saying:With DD-WRT firmware:Router works very well with DD-WRT firmware, as expected. But the product still deserves its meager 2 stars, because you should not have to void your warranty and rely on free third party tools to make a product usable."
2,Dont bother wasting money on this one!,"I should have been more though looking at the specs on this router.This is my first Cisco-Linksys router and will be my last for sure!I have had used Netgear all my life, though i would try something different as my Netgear got wiped out by a storm.Just received it, I was blown away that the basic features that Netgear always had this one does not even support like ""DHCP reservation"" feature!!!Are they serious, how could that no be a standard by now ?Secondly, when assigning MAC addresses for Wi-Fi you cannot even assign a name to them so you know what they are.I could go on with the limited settings the user can do with this router. I heard great things about Cicso, I cannot beleive they would even want their name on it with the poor features on control this has.My 6 year old Netgear router has 5x more features than this new one i just bought."
1,router,"product didn't work when I got it in the mail. Tried downloading drivers for it, since it was a older router, that didn't work either. So I won't ever be buying a used one again. I now have a new one that works great."
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought this wireless router looking for something that worked and was at a good price but since I received it, it's been giving me a hard time. I would get great reception when I was in the living three feet away from the router but in my bedroom I had low or almost no connection. I finally gave up when it was impeding me from getting online on my desktop. I'm going to return this and look for one of a better quality."
1,HORRIBLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT,"I just got the router today installed by following the instruction -- using the CD but could not install. I called for technical support as it turned out that the CD provided by Linksys should not be used for installation. I had to re-hook the computer to the internet and download the program to help guide me to install. After that everything seemed to be working OK (2 computers with XP and 1 with Vista OS) including the wireless connection (XP laptop). When I tried to do file-sharing among Vista and XP, guess what! The computer with Vista OS cannot connect with the 2 XPs. I called tech support, the guy who answered the call told me TO CALL MICROSOFT, WE CANNOT HELP YOU ON THIS!I think that type of problem at least Linksys should have encounter and have solutions ready. I don't think my case is not and isolated case. SIMPLY HORRIBLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT!"
1,usecured wireless network,"I have used a Linksys hard wired router for years with not a single problem. I followed the installation disc exactly. Everything works but I cannot change the name and I cannot figure out how to secure the network. I use a computer everyday but the un-explained terms and the no help to tell what they mean or how to use them.Terms like 64 bitencryption, 128 bit ,WEP,WAP,MAC etc. All I wanted was basic plug it in, follow the instructions, and have the thing work securely. I don't want to do exotic stuff just hook-up and go. I'll find another company that K.I.S.S. I am done with Lnksys!"
1,piece of junk,"why must it be so hard to create a wireless connection through this?it is junk,i'm so annoyed with it I really don't feel like f****** around with it anymore."
1,Linksys WRT54GL,"Can't give a review since the router never arrived. It was lost by USPS shipping partner,(contract shipper). My Daughter has also had problems with USPS contract shipping partners through Amazon. However, I must say that Amazon did credit back, to my account, the full purchase price. Will I order from Amazon again, yes? I will just choose a different shipping method."
1,Trash,"I hate this thing, I replaced it recently with a ZyXEL x-550, and Ive had NO PROBLEMS with it. This is 'ok' for the average home network user. But if you plan to play games, or P2P...maybe even VoIP...you cant go wrong with ZyXEL"
1,Linksys cheaps out,"I bought a WRT54GS a couple years ago and it still works well. I wanted another, to run wired and wireless devices in my garage. To save a few cents on RAM, Linksys changed operating systems and other details on that model, and advertised the WRT54GL as the model similar to my old one. I bought it, put it away, and finally got to it recently. I was shocked when I opened it: the WRT54GL has no wired ports, only a wireless transmitter. Maybe someone will find that useful, but it's unlikely -- someday you'll have a PC or laptop with a wired port that you want to plug in and cannot because this unit only talks wireless. It's useless for me, and now it's been too long since I bought it to return it. Why does Linksys cut corners this way? Cutting the wired ports cut their costs by $1 or less. Argh."
4,Meets my needs,"Easy to follow directions and easy set up. Once connected, have not had any problems. Good speed in every room of the house."
2,Doesn't Last Long,"I loved this router for about five mounths, and then with no warning it just stopped working."
5,"nice, strong and stable",i got it from amazon for one week and it is so nice and stable and i just love it!
2,out of date software,"The device works fine. The software is out of date. You have to call service and pay $10 to get the updated software. Service, from India, is fine, but they try to sell you other services also."
1,Router,"The cisco-linksys WRT54GL wireless router was not worth the purchase. It did not connect to the internet or even to the server,setting up a password was extremly diffiicult because it would lock me out along with everyone else. it was a complete waste of money and i am sorry that i purchased it."
