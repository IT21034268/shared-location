5,Just what the doctor ordered,"Cheaper than getting it from my vet, but the same product. No complaints. This is the same product I've used for years and haven't had flea or tick issues on the dogs with regular use (although I and my girlfriend did get tick bites this year in our own yard, so I'm guessing it's working pretty well!)."
1,Item is not as listed,"There is a discrepancy between what is listed and what is shipped. The image in the photo is the same as what is shipped, but main item page says this is ""k9 Advantix II"" which is not what is shipped. There is a significant difference in the formula between ""K9 Advantix"" and ""K9 Advantix II"". Hopefully Amazon will fix this problem and this review will soon be obsolete."
5,"Great price, product works","Used Advantix on my 3 Old English Sheepdogs for 4 years. It is the one that works. Amazon had the best price (with the no shipping fee deal) of any I've had in the past. I live in Florida, this stuff kills fleas!!!"
2,Be careful of alergic reactions,"I had used this on both my dogs. About the 4th time, my pug/westie mix started jerking towards her hind/tail area (I had put most on the back of the neck and a small portion at the base of her tail).Since we had used this product before, we first thought she had hip or back problems so took her to the vet and specialist. After $1500 and 4 trips to the vet, including major pain medication she was better after a few days so assumed it was just a joint/back/hip problem that got better. The next month, right after using Advantix again, the same thing happened which led to the obvious conclusion it was an alergic reaction. I wished I had known it could be washed off with dish soap (per the earlier review) because she had to spend another 2 days until she stopped reacting to the treatment."
5,Recommended Product,"Excellent product and a great price. Advantix is fast acting and effective. I found it has to be applied at least every 3 weeks though, but it is significantly better than Frontline & Frontline Plus.Additional FYI: If you have recently bathed your dog, make sure to apply this product two days after the bath, and do not allow the dog to get wet for the next 2 days after application of Advantix. My vet just told me that recently."
1,Moving back to Frontline....,"The thought of K-9 Advantix repelling fleas, ticks PLUS biting flies really appealed to me. I was a bit nervous because my youngest Chihuahua was only 11 weeks & 2 1/2lbs & I'd read about some reactions. Well the only reaction I saw was eye irritation (all 3 of my dogs woke up with eye goobers the following morning after application of K-9 Advantix BOTH times I used this product) Also, I applied in the morning & that evening I took them outside for a little romp & brought them inside & noticed a few black fly bites on their stomaches. My dogs have NEVER had fleas & 2 weeks later I noticed them scratching & saw fleas on them! I swear this Advantix stuff doesn't repell, but attracks fleas. I've had better luck with cheap store bought flea/tick repellant than with K-9 Advantix. Frontline...here we come!"
3,Greasy...,On my short haired dog it left greasy spots for at least a week that then collected every bit of dirt and left black spots on his fur that didn't go away until he was bathed. Had no problems on my malamute though.
1,BUYER BEWARE DOESNT WORK. COMES IN A BAGGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!,(Purchased from amazon seller FleaZapper)i received this in a little plastic baggy. no box. I contacted seller about it and they were very nasty. they told me I should learn to read but nowhere on the ad did i see that i didnt come with a box.. anyway they swore that it was genuine and not expired so against my better judgement i used it on my 4 dogs. well it did not work at all. i was better of putting water on them. no effect on fleas at all. this is garbage and a total rip off.. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! FAKE!!!!!!
4,"K9 Advantix 10 for dogs10 lbs and under, 4 pack",This product works for my dog. An occasional flee once in a while but nothing too concerning. She has sensitive skin and does scratch sometimes however it is not due to flees but her dry/irritated skin I believe.
1,Didn't work,"I used this product on my dog for a few months and he had a few fleas, but not a major problem. Then I decided to save money and not buy it for a couple months during the winter. The next spring I purchased 6 months supply. It did not work, not even a little. It even led to a major infestation in my house. I have never had that occur with any product before. I bought this product based on the reviews so I don't understand why it would work on one dog, and not at all on another. It ended up being a very expensive mistake."
1,"ticks, ticks, ticks",been using product on time for three months. went hunting this month 15 days into last aplication. We have lots of ticks and I find them the day after there not dead. verry discouraged will have to go back to frontline at least it kills them. sorry. cold dirty bird hunter
1,ADVERSE REACTION,"Here i sit with my 1 1/2 year old Japanese Chin 8 hours after Advantix application.When the time came for us to have quiet time, she came to my lap and i noticed she was shivering and staring into space. She is now hyper and will not rest, even though it is 3am.She continues to shiver and prance, holding her tail awkwardly. Another oddity is when i pet her she jerks her legs.There were no other variables to her day. i became concerned and searched if this med has reputation for causing adversities. YES! Please read about the effects beforehand and your will find other reports of reactions!!! POISON"
2,Expiration date 7-2008!!,"I will never order from this company again because the expiration date on the tubes are 7-2008! Considering we're using them for JUNE, JULY and AUGUST of 2008, that means that they're probably NO GOOD!! Sure enough, the one we put on her for JULY, 2008 did NOT work very well! In fact, we put it on her on 7-5-08 and she's been scratching like crazy from FLEAS for a week now and it's not time for the August tube to be put on yet!If this is the best they can do, they can forget me doing business with them!!!"
3,"I hear this is good, not sure dog was allergic","This is supposed to be a really good product. My mother says it works good for herdogs in preventing fleas. However my dog had a bad reaction to it within hours.So, I can't state if it helps my dogs or not."
1,** WARNING **,"BEWARE - My 90 pound male Labrador has suffered an adverse reaction to K9 Advantix. After two successful applications last year, we purchased K9 Advantix again this May 2010. Unfortunately he is suffering a horrible reaction due to this application. Perhaps an allergic reaction. Scheduled to see the vet this afternoon. I will never apply this or any of the other topical anti flea meds to my dogs again."
4,Great,Happy with my purchase. Arrived in a timely manor and product was unopened as promised. The box was beat up a lot but the package inside was fine. I knew that it was used going into it so I am very happy!!
2,still have fleas,"Your service was great quick and efficeint. The problem is the product did not work and my dogs dont even go out, only in our arms to the vehicle. I have toy poodles which at the heavist 8 pounds I would have thought it would have worked. Have used this product in the past no problem worked like a charm, maybe it was a bad batch."
5,great product,This is a little more expensive than some of the other products. But it works the 1st time. I've used competitive products that I've had to shorten the cycle for administering the meds. But this has done great. Thanks.
2,"No fleas, but plenty of ticks","I applied K9 Advantix on my dog about a month ago, and I've pulled 4 ticks off her in the last week and a half. She doesn't have any fleas, thank goodness, but to me ticks are even scarier.She is a 75 lb American Bulldog, so it's possible I need to re-dose her more often - but I'm hesitant to give her Advantix every 2.5 to 3 weeks. If you read the Advantix description, they just say it ""repels"" ticks, not that it prevents or kills them. Wish I had interpreted that for what it really meant in the beginning. I'm going to ask for my money back and switch to Frontline."
5,Great Product..,I used this item on my 8 lb poodle and 3 lb chihuahua and it works great! No problems. I received my item super fast. Thanks!
1,NOT SAFE FOR EVERY ANIMAL,"I just switched from advantage to advantix and my dog had a rash where it was applied. That wasn't too bad. But a few days later he began having seizures and vomiting. I had a strong feeling it was the advantix but Bayer doesn't list adverse reactions on the package so I called. I was told that couldn't happen as the medication is not absorbed into the skin. Do you know of anything that isn't? Skin has pores! It was a dumb response and they refused to report the seizures and vomiting but did report the skin rash. So I guess Bayer will admit there are adverse reactions, they just get to choose which ones. And if you google adverse reactions to K9 Advantix, you'll see my dog isn't alone. It may work great for some but Bayer needs to be more honest with their customers."
5,Efficient and effective,"My poor Chow had flea problems for a long time. Nothing worked until I tried K9 Advantix recently. Within 6 hours of the fist application, 98% of the fleas were gone. The remaining few disappeared by the following day. It is really nice to find a product that actually does what it is supposed to do. At about $10 a tube, it is a bargain. Especially considering how much money I wasted on useless stuff like sprays and flea collars."
1,Cunnigly devious,"Be aware that this company is knowingly marketing this product using a an imaging that represents the current range; however, they will supply an older version of the drug. Once you're order is placed the image will miraculously change to the old product line as if that is what you ordered all alone. Very devious."
1,Bad Allergic Reaction To Advantix,"I was prescribed Advantix by my vet. I applied it as instructed and within hours my dog was distraught. He didn't sleep all night, he was beside himself running around the house with jerky movements. He started shivering uncontrollably and panting heavily. We took him to the vet's - he said there was no antidote to the medicine and that any adverse symptoms should pass. My dog has still not recovered and is not himself. I will never give my dog this product again. I will never give my dog anything without researching the product myself first. Incidently one website seemed to say Bichon Frise/white fluffy dogs are more susceptable and my dog is a Coton de Tulear (related to Bichons)"
1,toxic to dogs mine is very sick,"This is not the same as Advantage. I used this on my beagle, followed the instructions and had a horrible reaction, started with the itching and skin became irritated. Then he started having neurological problems, is constantly pacing does not wag his tale, is lethargic at time then anxious."
1,My poor little dog is in agony,"I would never have applied this product to my dog if I had known what it would do. I applied it as directed, and everywhere it touched her skin is inflamed and red, her whole body is hot and she is in agony, twitching and whimpering. She keeps trying to scratch her back and cannot sleep or relax. I am waiting for a return call from the vet now. Please do not use this product, I feel horrible because I was just trying to help her and I will never forgive myself if she dies. Once I realized there was a problem, I immeadiately washed her with dishsoap but it didn't help. I will say that my other two dogs are just fine after application, but it isn't worth the chance."
1,Worthless,"I have used this product in the past with excellent results, but this must have been a bad batch, for I didn't see any positive results. My dogs were covered in fleas just one week after application, and I was forced to buy locally to resolve the issue. It is difficult to understand how a product can work so well, and then not at all!!!"
3,"Product okay, Package - not so much","I bought the K9 Advantix Flea Control for Dogs up to 10 Pounds - 6 applications. I received it in 2 days, which was great, but the package was very worn. The box was smashed because of poor packaging. I think the product is still useable, but it would have been nice to receive something that actually looks new."
2,So-so,"After various flea-killers failed to do their job on my Big Girl, I thought maybe they were counterfeit so, trusting Amazon, I bought this. After applying 2 weeks ago I'm still brushing out live fleas. maybe they've developed an immunity--this stuff used to work but now does about 75%. Anybody out there got a sure thing that kills the fleas but not the dog? (nothing Chinese, please!!)"
4,Works great,"Without this stuff, the mosquitoes literally SWARM around my dog. With it, they pretty much stay away for up to 4 weeks after application. I guess it works on fleas and ticks too since she's never had any of those obnoxious parasites either. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that after application, the fur can be a little matted for a couple of days. Looks kinda weird and can be dangerous to touch if you don't wash your hands right away. Side note: My dog is 68 pounds but I've been using the 55+ lb version of Advantix since she was 50 pounds. I called the company back when my dog was smaller and told them the mosquito protection wasn't working too well and they told me to go the next size up. Once I did, I didn't have any more problems. And yes, they assured me it was safe to do so in our case but I would definitely contact the company or your vet before you use more than the recommended dosage."
1,front line or advantix,i used both of this products this way and neither one worded will buy the oniginal for now on just a waste of money
1,junk,"Don't and I repeat DON'T waste your money it doesn't work on fleas and it doesn't work on ticks! I visited a friend in Tenn. who lives in the country last fall when I returned to Orlando I gave my Cocker Spaniel a bath and a haircut and was amazed that she had over 100 ticks,when I called the manufacture and told them about it the customer service lady acted like that was no big deal. Well it sure was to me. This crap is expensive, I even went to the size above her weight for the extra protection.It's supposed to repel as well as kill and from my experience it doesn't do either so save your money. I would have given it NO stars but you can't! PS I did not buy this from Amazon, Amazon is great! I bought from big box P-S. By the way P-S removed my review!"
1,Not reliable,"When I received the product it wasn't the one I purchased. It was just Advantix, not K9 Advantix!"
3,Advantix okay,"I changed to this product from a generic one to protect my dog from insect bites and reduce his scratching; he is an outside dog. If anything, I think he is scratching more. I don't see that it is worth a higher price than the grocery store generic."
2,This product really bothered my Bichon,"I have two cocker spaniels and a bichon frise. I used this product on them 7 April. It did not bother my two spaniels, but my bichon started going crazy. He would race through the house, run in circles, try to bite the spot on his back, right above his tail; or he would just sit and whimper. I called the 800 number on the box and was told that the dog is feeling tingling similar to when our foot falls asleep ( I wonder how they know this?), to not bathe him yet, and that it would subside in 24-72 hours. Five days later, he was still in a lot of discomfort. My vet said it was too late to bathe him at that point, and I had to take him in to get a steroid shot, and five weeks worth of prednisolone pills for him to take. Even though it has not bothered my spaniels, I will not use this again. My vet said that K9 Advantix has different and stronger stuff in it than others that are similar to it, and they will not carry it at their office."
5,really works,"this is the best product I have found to get rid of keep fleas off my dogs, I was petting my dog and noticed alot of fleas on his belly. I put the K9 Advantix on him the next day he did not have a flea on him."
4,Worked well,"I would recommend this product. My dog acted indifferent to my applying the Advantix and is seemed to work quickly on the fleas. Unfortunately, I purchased biospot for my other larger dog, at the same time, and the biospot not only sent my big dog into hysterics and then a day of lethargy, but it hasn't worked at all.Stick to the pricier flea products like advantix or frontline and get the job done!"
1,Not sure if it is authentic,"Product came with applicator bottles and instructions only. When I have ordered from other places in the past, they come in an original box with the applicator bottles sealed in foil and plastic, so you know that they have not been tampered with. I am very unsatisfied and unsure about using them on my dogs."
1,Picture does not match the item given,"I recieved the older version of K9 Advantix, not the newer version listed on the posting. The one I recieved does not work at all. My dog keeps scratching and we still find fleas on him. Would not recommend product at all."
2,"Possible knockoff brand, suspicious packaging","After overpaying for this at the vet I decided to try to save some money buying this online. After receiving it I found the packaging different than the one we have been purchasing. The vials of liquid were not marked and were very different from what I was used to. We reluctantly applied it and had no issues, but I would be hesitant to order this product online again. I have gone back to buying from my vet or local pet store."
1,Don't use it,"It will kill your cats and dogs if given in too high of an amount, which is easy to do with the amount in a single tube. The same chemical used in it to kill ticks was used in an earlier flea control product and was deemed unsafe by vets. Somehow the Bayer company repackaged essentially the same products but got vets to accept it. This product should NOT be sold over the counter and ONLY vets should apply it in control and monitored circumstances. I fear this is an example of corporate profit being but ahead of public health."
1,had to take my dog to the vet twice for reaction to advantix!!,I will never use this product again. After using this product my dog started panting and could not be still. He also had diarrhea so bad that I had to take him to the vet twice. The vet had to put him on 3 different meds 3 times a day for a couple weeks. I will only use natural products in the future. This is my baby!
4,like the product,We have never had problem with this product for our toy poodle. He may scratch a little more that normal for a few days but thats it.
5,Flea control for dogs,K9 Advantix Flea control is a great product. This shipper is great product shipped very quickly. This is a very competive price for flea control.
4,Looking for something efective,"Bought the product because last year my dog, a wonderful big Golden Retriever had a serious desease from ticks, and the products we had been using did not provide good enough coverage for ticks. Have applied it today because I just came back from the States and will see if it works.....our vet said it's very good, so we hope the dog will be effectively protected and able to go to his everyday walk, everywhere."
1,Not user-friendly at all,"Unfortunately, I had to purchase this book as part of my data structures class, and everybody in my class agrees it is just a horrible book for undergrad students. Too much mathematical jargon, coded algorithms which often have mistakes in them, and not enough plain english to convey to the reader the idea behind these fundamental concepts. If you want to learn, DO NOT buy this book."
2,Assigned Undergrad Book,"I am a visual learner but this book contains very little pictures to describe abstract algorithms and data structures. It just does not work for me. I learn by reference (examples), the book is not something you would want to use as a reference. The book uses a pseudo code template-tized approach. Basically, it'll give you the gist of how things work, but won't show you how to code it. To each his own."
2,"Not enough examples, clear explanations","Between a really bad professor and a really bad textbook, I'm not learning anything about data structures. This book has weird examples and not enough of them, and the book really doesn't explain just about anything well. I'm not too sure what else to say about it, if you are about to take a data structures class that requires this book, I think you'll want to get some supplemental materials (especially if your professor sucks as bad as mine)."
4,A book that really pays off.,"This book cuts to the essentials without digressing, unlike many other data structure books. The code requires a bit of studying and is not very clear, but once you get through the codes, it pays off. A learner who prefers having everything explained word by word might find this book too consise and without enough explanations. For other people, this is a great book."
1,worst book for c++,The most confusing book I ever read. I am a student at Cal Poly Pomona and I am studying CS. We are using this book for cs240 class. Ever body in the class agrees including the instructor that this book shouldn't be used for teaching. Our instructor is looking for a new book. The ideas and concepts are totally unclear. There are not enough examples. i really feel bad that I wasted my money on this book and now I have to buy another one
3,Algorithm source be die..,"I learned various algorithme in the Fundamentals of Data Structures in C. In my efforts, it's too difficult. So I want more sources. For textbook, it's very good book. But it's too hard to stuy alone. Specially Red-black tree...."
1,poor motivation and overall clarity.,"i used this book a couple years ago, but vividly remember the non-striaghtforward (and ocassionally wrong) algorithms given in the text. i also remember the ""diagrams"" were misleading, suggesting a different structure than described in the text. lastly, little to no motivation was given for many subjects, and time/space complexity were very much sidebar subjects."
1,Difficult to understand!,"I thought that I was the only person who has difficulties understanding this book, but it turned out, that a majority of my classmates later told me that they too have difficulties understanding this book!"
1,Too Academic,The book was far too academic to be usefull. Why are college text books written by instructors and so expensive?
3,this book has no solution.,I wanna perfect programs.But this book is in part.I need this book's solution manual.That's all
5,Great. The best autobiography I've ever read.,With her struggles through life she really does make a difference to her poor black students. She works in a high school in the center city Philadelphia. I should know alot about it because I had to do a report on it.
4,Well Written Story,"I really enjoyed this book. The story wasn't earth-shattering, but what really made the book for me was the writing. Busiek and Archer made the characters very real and interesting. For the first time I felt that I really had a sense of what it would be like to swing through New York on web lines or see the world through Spidey's mask.True to Spider-Man's legacy this book wasn't about the hero as much as it was about Peter Parker. Also, I thought it brilliant that the villian in the book was Norman Osborn and not really his alter-ego, the Green Goblin.I enjoyed the detective-type efforts that Peter went through to figure out the case. The books seemed as much of a mystery as it was an action story. I'm glad that I read it and would definitely recommend it."
1,Not worth the time,"Marvel made a terrible mistake by brinig back Norman Osborn. They did not have to use him in the novels too! If you hated the Spider-clone saga,then stay away from this book,"
2,Marinco Battery Charger,Purchased this product for my boat. Installed it and it worked fine for about 9 months. I can't figure why it went out or fine any fuses to change. I need to replace it at this time and will be installing a different charger.
1,dfective unit,The Item has been returned to me from my mecanic aparently it does not work please advise how do I return this item for exchange or credit.Henri9545942525
3,For beginners only ~ but good for them,"I confess that i knew little of the assorted rulers of Russia ~ other than Peter the Great, of whom i had read a biography, and Nicholas II who everyone knows was murdered by the Bolsheviks ~ except perhaps their names and a vague recollection of when they ruled. This book attempts to bring each of them to life for the reader. In some measure it has succeeded. Although i still will not know instantly the difference between, say, Peter II and Nicholas I, i do have a far better idea of who the Romanovs were, how they were related, how much they were not Russians (like the British royal family of the period, the seemed to become more and more German), and the troubles they faced with varying degrees of unsuccess. I had hoped for a little more detail on, for example, origins of the families, the Russians, the prior Grand Dukes and Czars; this is, though, a beginners' book, an introduction, and, as such, it fulfills its mandate quite nicely."
4,Heavy,"Yes, I read the weight on the product before ordering but thought 10 pounds must surely be a typo. They do weight 10 pounds, which is a bit heavy for arthritic hands, especially the large one. However, when cooking with children they would be perfect, because the weight helps to keep the bowl in place while mixing. I do LIKE them, they are just more than I bargained for."
2,Sanctuary,"Perhaps it is because I get extremely bored when I read ""stream of conscious"" types of books. This book simply bored me to death. The technique is written in prose form, I respect it, to some degrees, it is a type of art. However, the backcover of this book did a poor job of explaining what this book was supposed to convey. Maybe it is because there's nothing to review about! All said, this book showed the heart of evil as well as violence through the bleak characters of Popeye, Gowan and Red. They kidnapped the promiscous girl named Temple and took her to Memphis, where we meet a even more feared underground criminal gangs and bootleggars.Overall, I'm really disappointed in this book because I thought that William Faulkner, one of the best writers in the last century, should've done better. A lot of has to do with the style that he writes in, but overall, a very boring book."
2,The reviews are much better than the book,"This was my second shot at trying to appreciate William Faulkner. I read Light in August a few years back and gave it 3 stars. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck, a contemporary of Faulkner's, who is often compared to Faulkner. Some reviews have said if you like Steinbeck you will like Faulkner. I disagree. Steinbeck writes clear and concise stories that are carried by his creativity and a reflection of the life he led. To describe Faulkner's style in Sanctuary, I will borrow from another review that said it was ""oblique and distracting"". I finished the story with a half-hearted understanding of what I had just read. By reading all of the other reviews on this site I now understand so much more about the book. That's a problem, I don't connect with Faulkner...."
5,On the long blonde legs of Temple Drake,"I love it. The venality and corruption portrayed in this book are shivery and endlessly thought-provoking, with the character of Temple Drake as its fascinating focus. Faulkner outdid himself with Temple, a spoiled, capricious and ultimately abused young woman who becomes fed like a baby vampire on the seedy whorehouse where she is captive. The best thing about Sanctuary is, though, we never really know who she was before this pass. Virgin or whore?"
1,ripoff,"Ripoff, a cassette, that has to have a player that has a funtion that doesn't exsist anymore! A casette that no one can play, unless they are a time traveler and can go back to the late 70s&80s! The shipping is the biggest ripoff on monster, I mean Amazon!"
3,Its okay......,I started reading this book and at first was interesting but after a while I just couldn't get into it. Many times I haven't been able to get into a book and later on I breeze through. It was kind of depressing after awhile. Kind of a brutal book.
4,classic biker movie,good biker movie with a young jack nickolson. it might not be for everyone. but i enjoyed it
5,5 Star BAD!,"Hilariously bad! I love old Drive-In style biker flicks and this one is even worse than She-Devils On Wheels. A real gem of bad editing (the music is so loud at times you can't hear the dialogue), poor acting & blatant ad-libbing. This movie must have taken a whole week to make. All the bikes are Triumphs but Bruce Dern reads from a Harley-Davidson Service Manual. I loved Nicholson's prison striped pants with the dirty seat and a hole in them. I laughed my but off on this one."
1,Worst movie in the collection,"Bad Bad Bad.I love Nicholson, and I like biker movies.This was a waste from start to finish.910 movies in the collection, and this is the #1 worst one."
4,If you like motor bike gang fliks you should like this.,Its cool to see old Jack in this during is younger times. Another good one to add to the Jack Nicholson collection.
2,A cast of future greats in a disappointing movie.,"Man, what a bummer! Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd, Harry Dean Stanton, Cameron Mitchell - with a cast like that in a biker movie, you'd think it would be great. Very little chopper scenes, and the bikers' outfits looked like they were grabbed from a thrift store. Biker chicks? - Forget about it! There were a couple shown briefly, with one stripping down to, dare I say it - her bra! The storyline is the typical bad boys getting out of hand - with one grabbing a straight guy's pregnant girlfriend after beating him up. I won't give away the ending - in case someone just has to buy this barker."
1,One of the Worst Biker Films Ever Made,"This has got to be one of the cheesiest biker films ever made. The plot is thin, and the acting reminds me of a grade school play. I bet Jack Nicholson and Bruce Dern are regretting they were ever involved in this film."
3,mildly rousing rebels,"this movie is for people who want to collect biker b-movies, not for those looking for great acting, story, or production budget. so, there are some nice bikes worth seeing here and the plot is silly enough to have fun with. definitely a cheap thrill and i'm glad to have it in my collection."
4,BUY THIS,Envelope-pushing arrangements and improvisation by four masters of the saxophone. Highly recommended.
1,A modem for Windows and Linux,"I purchased this modem after a lengthy serach for a modemthat can work with Windows and Linux (in this case: SuSe).However, I was very dissatisfied with the performance(or no performance at all!). At first, I tried to setupand configure using the exact steps in the user manual.It did not work. Then I allowed Linux to probe it. Linuxdid not recognize it as well. I recommend cautious buyingthis product..."
2,"china, why u no make wings fit?!","so this is the third dragon iv'e bought for one reason or another the wings wouldn't fit into the dragon. nothing like manual labor for your birthday, dad."
1,Fat City Doesn't Rate a Cookbook,"Oh Puleeeeze. Houston as America's Premier Restaurant City? What happened to New York and San Francisco? Even Las Vegas has better food than the Fat Capital of the US. This cookbook-lite embodies the worst transgression of all -- imagining that the world revolves around its city, and that somehow that matters to foodies. It's pretentious and silly. Besides we all know that nobody in Houston eats mesquite-roasted duck, unless they're trying to impress someone else at the table (usually from out of town). They eat at MacDonalds and hide the supersize when a normal-weight person walks by. Go back in the kitchen and check how many of those recipes REALLY start with cream of mushroom soup."
2,Just OK,"This item was not as nice as I expected it to be. The instructions are only one small piece of paper front and back. Someone who has no experience with a knitting spool might need more explanation. The box shows pictures of different animals you can make, but there are no instructions on how to make the animals. The knitting needle included is flimsy cheap plastic, and although the knitting spool seems like good quality, the painted flowers on it are smeared. The yarn is very cheap acrylic. My daughter still liked this item, but i gave her different yarn and a different needle."
2,Rough Center Hole,The hole in the center is much smaller than I expected and the wood inside wasn't well sanded so the yarn tube that comes out is covered in wood pieces and has been caught and pulled. I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and I was really disappointed. I'm going to be purchasing her a plastic one from a craft store.
3,Vengeance (VHS) Tape,"This is a VHS tape from a long time ago that we wanted to see. The quality was not very good, but that's understandable. It's kindof crazy to see how things were filmed ""back then"" and what they are now, especially with the Movie Ratings and what is allowed now to be on film, i.e., the violence and language - now and then!"
2,Not good.,"The book was described as ""in good condition"". The cover was broken and taped on. Seller didn't say that. I overpaid."
3,"Not bad, it does the job","This text is OK and some of the examples and problems are well done. It jumps a bit in subject matter, but that's only compared to the order the subject matter was presented in the class I took. It does seem to contain all the topics that were relevent to Chemistry 1 and the index was spot on in finding the info I needed about a particular term or concept."
3,Chem Student Guide Book Review,"This book was a bit beat up due to shipping. Shipping was very inadequate. Came by media mail, wrapped in newspaper and a paper envelope. The envelope was completely torn open as well as the ""protecting"" newspaper. The inside pages are still ok, which is the important part, however very disappointed in the outside condition."
1,Never received my merchandise!,I ordered a book for my chemistry class two months ago and still havent received it. So now im stuck with no book for class and paid for nothing. This distributer sucks and I deffinetly dont recommend them!
2,"Unless u have to, dont buy",This book is not very informative. I would recomend Zumdohl 6e or something else.
2,Not good when compare to Chang's Chemistry book,This book made me confuse. Not clearly written.I prefer to use Chang's chemistry book.
2,CHem,"This book is horible!!!!!!!!!! vary confusing for the mild minded person. buy it at your own risk. there needs to be more diagrams explaning the consepts in the book insted writing, chemestry is also and imagnary subject also at an atomic level not just a quantam one."
2,Chemistry,"This book drops mega-ton bombs more faster than you blink...'cause neutrons travel at a tremendous speed...clouds of smoke, un-natural blends of Fe. Only under one circumstance, it's if you're blunted, by this book 'cause the folks at the school want it.It has a few mistakes too...and the authors and editors could care less about undergraduate students."
5,It's a text that does its job,"No chemistry textbook can be used exclusivly to learn chemistry. A student must attend the lectures and show up for recitation in order to understand the concepts more fully. Chemistry is not an easy subject; it involves math and an imaginative mind in order to picture what one cannot see. If your instructor has not required it, you should consider buying the solutions manual. Let's face it- how do you know your answers are right? It may cost a good amount, but you can always resell it when you're done with the course. This text actually provides more diagrams than any other text I have seen thus far and I believe it is easier to read and comprehend than other texts. This is a text for someone who can sit down and study. Although, this is coming from a chem major, so I sometimes find myself wondering why people find it hard, just like you may find it hard for people to understand something you are interested in."
3,"It's okay, but...","If you are buying this book, bear in mind that it is very, very long. And I completely understand where people say that the text is explained very well. But for me, the text is explained so well that it turned into rambling. The whole basis of the lesson seemed to be lost in the overly done explanation. It would have been easier, or at least in my case, if they just had the pure text that I need to learn, without all of the extra words.This book is good, depending on what kind of learner you are. If you need a lot of explanation, this book is nice. But if you are someone who gets drained by a lot of text, maybe another book would do."
4,Vintage Photos,"The pictures and art work of this book alone makes it close to a masterpiece. Even for one with limited reading skills, could greatly appreciate this piece of work. The photograph of early coins (money) guite intriguing, and the drawing of indigenous men flying the Masonic flag with European encroachers approaching from the rear. The picture of the Shriner whiskey bottle, on a square & fidelity I found to be hilarious since American Freemasonry began in a tavern, no less.The book is made up largely of exotic Masonic jewells,aprons,hats,trestle boards,and pictures. One look at the Shriner's ornament on page 239 the observer will instantly realise certain hidden truths. Completed in 2005 this book has updated info and a fresh take."
3,Good book,This was a decent mason book. Lots of pictures if your into that sort of thing. Did not find it very informative in comparison to the other litature I've found in masons.
3,No DVD-Audio,I ordered this based on some information I got from another site that stated it supports the DVD-Audio format. It does not. Not really a negative review. Just doesn't have what I am looking for.Just posting so that anyone else looking for a portable dvd-audio player (is there anyone?) doesn't make my mistake.
1,Very poor long term battery life,"Like many reviewers, I had been very pleased with this portable DVD player. I used it approx. 3 times in three months and when I tried to use it today after charging the battery, I found that it would no longer hold a charge. It is completely dead and, of course, there is no longer any warranty. It's great if you only will use this unit on a/c power but I bought it as a portable for the plane so now it is useless. Avoid."
4,Limitation of wireless headphones,"I am happy with this headphones set.I have used them hard for several days now.Comparing them with ""high end"" wired headphones, for example Sony900 seriesI listen to a lot of acoustic jazz, 30's songs, and to regular classical music.Mozart, Beethoven etc.I am not interested in ""surround"" sound.While the sound quality of these phones is good, they simply cannot compare with wired phones which are driven from a headphone amplifier. The frequency response is good, but the DYNAMIC RANGE ie ability to play at realistic loudness, is simply not there. Nor can it be, since these phones are driven from two tiny batteries.I think the design compromise made by SONY is a good one.Keep the phones light, and easy to wear, give up dynamic range for comfort.If you want to hear a rock band at full volume go with wired phones-Jon"
2,Probably OK if you don't use with a plasma TV,I hooked up the optical cable to my plasma tv. There was quite a bit of interference. I moved the unit away from the tv but this did not solve the problem. I then decided to look in troubleshooting and found the answer to my problem. The troubleshooting guide says you may experience interference from a plasma tv. So I returned the unit to Amazon
1,"Hiss, Crack, Pop","I read and followed the directions but got only hiss, crack and pop with these headphones. I tried plugging into the optical port on the TV but couldn't get it to work. I returned the headphones but had to pay shipping and a restocking charge. Never got refund from vendor, Etronics.Buying electronics and software is risky and best done locally.I had a Sony TV with built-in infrared headphones and they were great. Now I can't find anything that works."
1,DIDN'T WORK,I needed cordless head phones. I like Sony products. I read the reviews. They were good. I bought them. They didn't work. I tried everything and even recruited help. I sent them back. Maybe someday I'll get something that works so my wife doesn't have to listen to the TV late at night.
2,"These are noisy, hissy headphones","There IS background hiss of significant and distracting levels from the cheap amp on these headphones. Compared to the Pioneer wireless these are junk.Further, the implementation of the dolby functions, including virtual surround, is very poor. Again, hear the Pioneer which are amazing in comparison.There is little bass, and the treble is distractingly bright.Verdict:Fail.For an equally compromised set of headphones, but with long range, See the Sennheiser R130."
1,No Sound,"Don't work. No info on what might be wrong. Unfortunatly, can't return. Bummer, a $200 piece of plastic waste."
3,Basic Headphones,"I heard surround sound on them one time, in other words, the sound moved around my head during one scene in a movie, but besides that, not really, and that is important to me.The charging station is what is completely and utterly frustrating and plain awful. Literally had to pick the unit up every time, lift it over my head, turn all the lights on, just to see the teeeny tiny protrusion that the headphone needs to sit on top of, then by that time, the other side has slipped off. I'm not challenged, usually, by these things. Their newer version is much better with the charging station. I sent these back and got my full refund. Had to pay for shipping.They are comfortable, but not worth the time or trouble."
2,Sony MDR-DS3000 Infrared Wireless Headphones,"Used these approx 2 hrs. before sending them back. Setting them in the cradle for recharging was very ""location specific"". The audio quality was less than anticipated especially given the digital (fiber optic) input. Sony's surround process was unusable. I will state the ear cushions were more comfortable than the Sennheiser's that I bought as an alternative."
1,Very Unhappy,"These headphones are complete trash. The reason is simply because the range is bad and keeps dropping a signal even when you are near the receiver. Battery life is below the advertised promise and you can hear a strong static build-up over time, as batter life diminishes. Thank goodness amazon.com takes care of its customers with easy return. Dont buy!!!"
3,Too much hiss,"I had these headphones for a couple of days, but returned them because of the constant background hiss. I typically used them 13 feet from the transmitter, at night when there was no sunlight to cause infrared interference. The transmitter was connected to my Tivo HD using optical cables. There was nothing I could do to eliminate the hiss except turn the volume way down. It was very disappointing.Pros:- Comfortable to wear- Automatic on/off- Optical connectors- Attractive- Fairly easy to adjust the volume- Easy to setup and useCons:- Way too much hissI purchased some Pioneer SE-DIR800C headphones instead, and I love them. Get those instead!"
5,Exceptional!,My wife likes to listen to TV late into the evening. She finds the headphones comfortable and the sound excellent. I enjoy the peace and quiet.
3,Good features but hisses,The headphones has a good design but has a background hiss. Lots of reviews mention this but some are more distint than others. It could be attributed to interference from other electrical devices. I guess the best thing you could do is try it to see if you like it.
3,MDR-DS3000 Range,"We ordered the Sony MDR-DS3000 headphones because they were one of the few wireless headphones that will work with our new television's digital optical output. After charging the batteries and testing the headphones, the sound quality was exceptionally good up to 15-feet from the processor. After 15-feet, there were noticeable popping and crackling. Unfortunately our viewing distance was 18-feet. Therefore we are returning the unit.Amazon was great and offered a full refund! We will never hesitate to order from Amazon in the future.Sony MDR-DS3000 Wireless Digital Surround Headphones"
2,Why the Hiss,The hiss is dominant even with clean line of sight to IR transmitter.It's annoying during quiet passages.
5,Thanks Bandai,I just want to say that this is a improvement from digi-battle and a major improvement from the d-tector cards.... Bandai did the right thing by bringing digimon back.
1,"Looks cool, but...","This figure looked really cool, which is why I bought it. Now, when I open the box, one of the wings was not attached. When I tried to put the wing on, the dragon's arm broke clean off. I never did get the wing on. Now, seeing as I really like the look of it, I am going to buy another one, and if that one breaks as well, screw it."
1,"Only one, not ""10 per case""","Got only one, not ""10 per case"" as stated in the title. For this per-item price, you can get better goggles."
1,Magazine subscription was never processed,"I ordered Gq British edition as a gift for a friend last May. It was supposed to arrive by August but never did. I called the phone # on the credit card statement & they said they would check it out & let me know. I never was contacted, so I emailed Amazon & they replied right away and said the publisher had never processed the order. In the meantime, the friend was moving, so I decided to cancel the order. Amazon refunded the money fairly quickly. The problem was with the publisher, not Amazon."
5,spirit-filled,I'm looking for this on hard back.I have used it so much it's in half.Having a good handbook for study works out very well.
2,Eerdmans Bible Handbook,It was as worn as the one I had thrown away. The spine cracked open when I opened it. I guess I should have ordered a new one.
5,Best book for New Holdem Player,"If someone asks you for a book to learn Texas Holdem, this is it. Easy to read yet filled with great nuggets on how to play limit, no limit and tournament holdem. A perfect appetizer for Ed Miller's Small Stakes Holdem main course, (with Sklansky's Theory of Poker for dessert)."
5,Best Book Yet for Begining & Intermediate Players,"It's hard to believe that Ed Miller had only been playing poker for eighteen months before writing this excellent book. What makes it truly exceptional is the way in which Miller makes No- Limit COMPLETELY intelligible to the beginner. His discussion of playing with Short Stacks in cash No-Limit games using the equivalent of Phil Hellmuth's Top-Ten Opening Hands not only vindicates recent criticism of Hellmuth's pre-flop strategy, but virtually guarantees that a novice will be a handful in any No-Limit ""ring games."" If you only have money for one book on poker, this is the one to buy (and I've read them ALL.)This book will pay for itself the first time you sit down in a No-Limit cash game and wipe the floor with the Big Stacks at the table."
1,"If limit is your game, buy Lee Jones ""winning low limit"" instead","I bought this book at the same time I bought ""winning low limit"" by lee jones. Had previously read ITH by mathew hilgger, but lee jones's text is so great in the way it presents strategic information, I now prefer it to ITH.As for this book, I have no idea what the people who say this is a great introduction for hold'em are talking about.The presentation is confusing, the book contains a lot of fillers with little valuable information. Rules of hold'em aren't that complicated that requires the extensive chapters on reading the board as this necessarly comes with experience and doesn't take that long.As for strategy, I admit Miller is a bit more agressive than lee jones(which depends on the stakes you play in) and does present very valuable ideas, but I think the presentation is less than functional for complete begginers, for whom this book is intended.It is a cheap book...in all ways possible."
5,Readable and Smart,"Ed Miller, the author of the more complete Small Stakes Hold'em, has written a beginner's book for everyone. It covers all the bases: rules of the game, starting hands and pot equity, kinds of bluffing, pot odds, NL hold'em, NL tourneys.It's packed with information with handy summaries and Johnson boxes with key points.Experts might want more depth, but there's Small Stakes Hold'em for limit games, at least.This book is the ideal foundation for starting to play Texas Hold'em."
1,Thunder & Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft,"This book gives little insight into the craft of writing - beyond the instructions to just schedule some time to write and then do it. It does give Goldberg's reflections on the writing process with emphasis on her internal thoughts and processes when writing. I was disappointed in this book, as it seems to be a recycling of old material, such as her well-known writing practice. This book is primarily a book of musings on the writing process. I do not recommend this book for those who are seeking how-to-do it information on the craft of writing."
2,Not Very Helpful,"Basically, the author just rambles on until she finds her point. In fact, she admits that this is her writing style. Yes, the book is well-written. It is like a conversation with an interesting author. But I did not find it helpful. It will not teach you to write well. It does not contain many secrets. If you simply want to connect with a brave author who has mastered her own voice, go for it. If you are looking for guidance to become a better writer, you should probably avoid this. To become a better writer check out David Morrell's book on writing and Stephen King's book:On Writing."
4,Great Experience,"An avid fan of Natalie and her books, I was excited to hear about this one and bought it the day it came out. Like all her books, this one encompasses a certain time in her life and her feelings about writing. I just like the way she writes. So much of it is personal and I enjoyed reading about how certain books have affected her. Every chapter is a novel in itself. She really gets to the root of who we are as writers and why we write. I especially liked the part where she described her need to know the author and the story behind him or her. I thought I was the only one who checked out a book before I read it and felt that nervousness at the first chapter. This is a great book and I am recommending it to all my fellow writing friends."
3,Thunder and Lightning???,"I am a great Natalie Goldberg fan and expected a lot from her book titled ""Thunder and Lightning"" I was excited to find this book and expected a ""powerful read! I was a bit disappointed. I love when Natalie (in previous books) talks about her family and life and being Jewish. Her lonliness as a young child made her an excellent writer. Her writing style makes you feel like you are in the same room with her and speaking with her. Like having a conversation with her. I loved Mr.Clemente and the rain (Long Quiet Highway.) I love how she loved her Grandmother. In Thunder and Lightning there is some of this but it is fragmented and hard to follow. I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Long Quiet Highway,"" but I did like the story about ""Linda"" and ice skating."
1,Bleh.,"A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense. This book may be interesting to those who like new age poetry but if you're primarily looking to improve your writing craft - seek elsewhere. There are a few nuggets of helpful wisdom here, but they are buried by reams of meandering memoir."
1,Don't trust this woman!,"Never, never, never take writing advice from a woman who spends more time writing about writing than she does writing her own fiction. In fact, reading books about writing is silly. If you want to write fiction, read fiction. If you want to write poetry, read poetry. If you want to write writing-advice books, all right, read this as a sample, but at least admit to yourself that you just want to make a buck off other non-writers pretending they're writers."
4,Angels Watching over Me (Shenandoah Sister # 1),"I enjoyed reading Michael Phillips story of two girls of different backgrounds ( one slave and one of a daughter of a slave owner) who are trying to make a life after both of their families are murdered. At first I had a difficult time starting the book, but once I got going I could not put it down. Now, I am reading the next book in his series (Shenandoah Sisters)."
3,Good teenage read ---,"This book I would recommend for teenagers, junior high age - a very easy read. This is a story about two teenage girls, a slave and a white girl, from different plantations whose families are murdered by marauding outlaw soldiers - their plantations pillaged by these men. This is a horrifying nightmare for Katie and Mayme and the story of how they overcome this tragedy."
1,Dog Modem.,Save your money. This modem does not work with Windows XP at all. It will work with a Linux system. But the modems has problems and should have never been put on the open maket for consumers before these problems where corrected. One star is to high of a rating. Zero would have been better.
2,Beware if using with hyperthreading processor computers,If you buy this modem for the modem on hold feature (call waiting) be warned that this feature does not work in computers with Hyperthreading (HT) processors with windows XP. The drivers included will not work at all and you will have to install a beta driver available from Zoom's website to get the moden to work but without the call waiting capability.
2,Don't Buy This Bed If You Have a Bad Back,"I purchased the twin size Intex inflatable air bed and unfortunately I developed back strain after sleeping on this bed for two days. This bed may be great for children and sleep-overs, but if you weigh 150 lbs, the bed may not be supportive of your weight. I found when I inflated the bed before going to bed, I woke up in the middle of the night and had to add more air to the bed because of sagging in the middle of the bed."
5,Great Product,"This is the 3rd Intex bed I've purchased in the last few years and this one is by far the best one ever. It's easy to use, easy to transport and very comfortable to sleep on. A great value and product."
4,"So far, so good.",Our 4 year-old granddaughter has slept on it for 4 nights and all is well. I like the fact that it is higher off the ground than other inflatable beds are.
4,My Review,I recently got this item and it actually isn't that bad. I purchased the one that doesn't come with the screen protectors in color black. There is one problem though. I wouldn't advise putting your DS in a dusty or hairy area or even in your pocket with this skin on. It catches materials fast but they an be easily removed.
3,Does the job,"When I first got it I was thinking ""what is this piece of crap?"" But when it's on a DS it looks much more appealing except for the fact that the edges of the silicone case aren't really fine cut, so in some parts the edge is jagged."
1,It is inexpensive for a reason,I was not happy with this case. It fits very loosely and does not stay in place very well. I had bought it to help protect it if it was dropped by my son but it slides around on the Nintendo DS and I will be getting a different one. Also the part that covers the speakers just flaps around so when you close the DS they get folded and do not help the case stay one. In my opinion it wasn't worth the few dollars spent.
3,good protection,"This is a decent case for the ds. We had it on the DS for a while and it stays on well. The only thing I did not like was that in the fold area the little pieces that attach one side to the other kind of hang, but there was no problem with it. You have to take it off to attach guitar hero, but oh well, cant have it all."
1,Too small for Nintendo DS,This fell apart when attempting to put on the DS. Seller should state this is for the lite only.
3,fun but bad ending,"This was a fun book to read especially for us 40ish chicks who fantasize about younger men. The ending to the book was horrible, however. It's like she either got tired of writing and just quit and never finished the story or she couldn't decide what to do with the story and let it go. It just stopped. There should have been at least one more chapter and a more definite ending."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I'm a big fan of Pamela Redmond Satran's work. I loved her first two novels, The Man I Should Have Married and Babes in Captivity, but Younger is my favorite so far! The heroine Alice is completely believable and sympathetic, and I loved reading about how she navigated the world of younger women, and younger men. This was a funny, engaging, thought-provoking book that kept me reading late into the night. I recommended it to all my friends and you will too!"
4,Good for all ages!,I am 29 and I appreciated the young and older perspectives in this book. It was much more entertaining than I had anticipated. Great beach book!
4,New CPR disc,"We saw CPR the other night and I must say that it was the most energized I've seen David in years. The disc has some fantastic melodies including ""Little Blind Fish"", ""Morrison"" and ""That House"".If you enjoy CSN I highly recommend this disc as David's son is a superb piano player and Jeff on guitar is pretty out of control. The playing of his new colleagues takes David's ability to a level we haven't seen in years.my $0.02.... jjs"
4,Awsome book!,"Great book.I got it when I was about 8 but did not use it till I was 11.Very encompasing.It has a black-and-white drawing from 3 angles for all aircraft and a photograph or more for most.It is still compact enough to fit in most pockits.The only bad thing about it is,like another reviwer said,is that it does not feature American dive or torpedo bombers even thought it shows an Avenger on the back! Still,a great buy for the money."
5,Excellent quick reference guide,"You can't beat the price for a very well made book like this. This covers American, Italian, german, french, russian and japanese aircraft and more. I use this book often when I'm working on my website and I highly recommend it. C. Jeff Dyrek"
5,my opinion,"I think this book is fantastic.The book tells you about american,british,soviet union,german,italian,and japaneese planes.This book also tells you about bomber planes of all the countries.The book has some real pictures and it also shows colorful illustrations."
2,not what I expected,"I wish I had the chance to look at the book before I purchased it. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it.It includes the Republic P-43 Lancer but no Yaks or Hawker Tempest! The Brewster Buffalo is included (but listed as F2S, not F2A). The Grumman F4F Wildcat is included (as well it should be) but the F6F Hellcat isn't (though the photo in the Wildcat article is of a Hellcat!). The ""Other Nations"" section is one page, the Commonwealth Wirraway (Australia); why not include it under British Commonwealth? The photo of the Fw 190 has been used SO MANY times; get something different. The photo of the Ju 87 has been retouched (during WWII?) and is just plain bad. The Bf 109 photo combines the worst of the Fw 190 and Ju 87 photos: over used and retouched. I could go on but you get the idea.The book is probably fine for someone with no knowledge of World war II aviation, but anyone who knows a little about it should not purchase this book."
3,heartwarming lez story - the writing is horrible,"the story is good and heartwarming in that coming-out sorta way... although a bit one-dimensional. however, the actually writing is almost painful at times. granted, there is a disclaimer in the first paragraph of the story that reminds us that she is not a writer..."
4,"Good commentary, but brief","The commentary is very helpful, but very brief. It is not overly academic, but informs the reader of important technical facts as to history and the text. The author also writes from a spiritual viewpoint and not just an academic treatise. I would recommend the book for anyone who is looking for a brief commentary on Ezra and Nehemiah that is not just a dry scholarly work."
5,Fantastic read !!!,"I have to admit that I did not expect this book to be as good as it is. Being a ""Keys"" freak, I purchased this book to learn more about that old bridge I see when I drive down to Key West. WOW, I got a lot more from this book.Well Done !!!!"
3,Bio of Flagler with a dash of railroad,"This really reads more like a short bio of Flagler, rather than delving into the nitty gritty of how the railroad got built. Particularly when you compare it to a book like David McCullough's on the contemporary building of the Panama Canal, it seems quite thin. Two of the chapters in fact focus on the famous Labor Day hurricane, which essentially led to the railroad's demise. But for a quick overview of the man and his greatest project, it is a good read."
3,Historical Railroad,"The Last Train to Paradise was interesting to read as a documentary. I would have enjoyed more personal information from the people involved as the opening does with Hemingway. Our book club selected this book as our read after visiting the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach, Florida. The discussion was interesting."
4,Fascinating innovator,"Having recently moved to southern FL we see Henry Flagler's name everywhere. I didn't know much about the man, so this book was totally informative and entertaining. Flagler was innovative and smart. His work lives on. Also enjoyed learning about his background and how his ideas affected others."
4,A Great Read Before Driving to Key West!!,"As you drive from Key Largo to Key West you will see, and drive on, part of the old Flagler railroad bed. This railroad was the vision of Henry Flagler, a wealthy co-founder of Standard Oil. This book is spellbinding because the story is compelling. The engineering feats are fascinating. Connecting little lumps of islands by rail was definitely a ""it can't be done project"". But it was done in the early 1900's, used for a time, then ended in catastrophe. Nice book to read before you make the trip."
3,"Half good, half so-so","There's both good and bad to this book.First, the good:1) The story is fascinating. I spent a few years living in Florida, and was already a little bit familiar with Flagler's railroad and the 1935 hurricane, but the author rounds out my collection of antidotes with the full story behind them.2) The author writes in a clear, simple style that keeps you interestedThe bad:1) There's not enough depth. Now I want the full story! This, like others have mentioned, reads more like a magazine story than a definitive account of history.2) The photos! They are too small, and too lacking in detail. Surely there are more and surely they could be printed just one to a page, not two or three. (The pages of this paperback version aren't big enough, I don't think, for that kind of layout.)"
4,A captivating reminder of the forces of nature versus technology,"Flagler's grandious railroad across the Florida Keys was in itself bold and way ahead of its time, but the tale of the contest with the immense forces of the hurricanes that destroyed it is of epic dimension (you can still see the ruins of the old bridges from the highway). A great story, very well told: impossible to put down, a real page turner."
3,A superficial look at Flagler and the Florida East Coast RR,"Last Train is a short book about a big project...one that essentially created the state of Florida as we know it today. The book focuses on the last leg of Flagler's railroad that crossed ocean and swamp to connect Key West with the mainland.The book seems more like an expanded magazine piece rather than a thorough treatment of this fascinating man and his amazing project.Yes, buy the book, but don't expect a Steven Ambrose-like treatment of the subject (considering my opinion of Ambrose's writing ability this is faint praise indeed)."
3,Good story teller,"The author is a very good story teller and writes very well. The subject matter is even interesting. I was never bored reading this book. I even think the book was a good length for the reader with only a casual interest in the subject. But for whatever reason, and even though I am glad I read the book because it supplied information I didn't know before, I found it as just an ""okay"" book. It is a well-written, interesting book, but it just isn't a book that would near the top of any list I would give people if they asked, ""Read any good books lately?"" But really, it is a decent, enjoyable book to read."
4,Great Book on History of the Keys,"This book by Les Standiford is chock full of information and tidbits relating to the development, not only of south Florida, but specifically of the Florida Keys. As a resident of the Keys I find the book to be informative, accurate and extremely well written. It is a very easy read that should be required reading for local schools and highly recommended for those planning on visiting our paradise."
4,Fascinating,This book was recommended prior to a trip I was planning to Key West. I bought it and learned things about my journey that I never would have known if I hadn't read it. It is a very interesting and easy read told almost in the form of a biography of part of Henry Flagler's life.Before reading this book he was not known to me although several of the companies and people he was in partnership were.The story in this book is that of the building of a railroad built to connect the keys in Florida to the mainland. The vision and the tenacity of Flagler is obvious throughout the book. He was an astute business man and yet seemed to have empathy for his employees and for the land that he came to love and made so much money from.It was an engineering fete that wasn't even contemplated in the early 1900s when he started it. The tragedy in the end when it was wiped out in a hurricane is palpable as you read this book.
5,Exciting Florida History,"This is a highly readable, excellent and exciting book about the exploits of Henry Flagler, especially his construction of a seemingly impossible railroad to Key West, Florida. Flagler's work in constructing a railroad down to Miami and several resort hotels are the first half of the book. The extension to Key West is presented in far more detail. Excitement comes from three hurricanes that ruin the railroad and kill hundreds during its construction in 1906 and later in 1935."
5,Railroad to Key West --> a remarkable piece of history,"Henry Morrison Flagler, co-founder of Standard Oil, built the 1912 railroad to Key West that was destroyed in the September 2-4, 1935 hurricane; known as the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. This is an incredible historical account of his personal (wives, children, ...) and business life (transport of grain, hotels, association with John D. Rockefeller, ...) that led up to the building of this railroad and the hurricane that destroyed it.This book has the literary excellence and all the amusing details of a superb novel, except that it is true. Last Train to Paradise is absolutely riveting and also educational for those (like me) who never heard of the railroad to Key West before."
4,A Wonderful Tribute to the Man and His Legacy,"I read this book after touring Flagler College in St. Augustine, FL. You cannot go anywhere in St. Augustine without hearing and seeing Henry Flagler's legacy. I really enjoyed the book - I could barely put it down. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in railroad history, and feel it is a ""must read"" for anyone who's been to the beautiful city of St. Augustine and gotten a taste of Henry Flagler's visionary spirit.If you read the book without having visited the Florida Keys or St. Augustine, I strongly recommend that you do so soon!"
3,Wasn't that a mighty storm,"A great tale. A storm most now alive never heard about. Perhaps the most powerful to strike the US. And destroy the dream of a railroad over the ocean. A fascinating tale of one man's determination to make an idea come true. If you've gone to the Keys, or want to go, you need to read this."
3,Last Train Review,"I liked the convenience of being able to download the book onto my IPad, but the pictures did not come with the text. I would have been much happier if the purchase had come with the same features as the print version."
5,It lasted just over 10 years,"CCR being one of the great 60 th and seventies bands with hit after hit,the band produced some of the greatest songs ever. Tom Fogerty his brother John Fogerty , Stu Cook and dough Clifford being 4 great musicians. I love it"
4,never gets too old,"Haven't listened to CCR in quite a while, but listening to this reminds me of how much of a impact they made in classic rock history."
5,They Are Still FAN-tastic!!,"This was an excellent album to hear after all this time. A true, GOLDEN OLDIE!Brings back wonderful memories! C-o-o-o-l!!"
4,Chronicle Rocks,"CCR's Chronicle: 20 Greatest Hits is truly that... the greatest hits CCR ever produced all in one wrapper. If you like CCR, you will LOVE Chronicle."
5,Why a review?,Why should I write a review for a CD that has 20 songs by Creedence Clearwater Revival!! Seems like a waste of time to me. 5 Stars.
3,Great songs,All of the songs are great because it's CCR but the audio quality is not very good. It's okay on a stereo but not with headphones.
5,Great retrospective,"I wish I knew Creedence when they were around, but since I'm only 14, I have to hear it off this CD! But I really love the solid rock of these songs, especially ""Travelin' Band"" and ""Bad Moon."" There's no band that has come along like them, so get this CD and find out for yourself how nice rock was in the old days!"
5,A whole barrel and not one bad apple,"Creedence Clearwater Revival produces sounds that permeated the many movies since their time. It is almost a game to figure out how many movies used their music. You know the image for Suzy Q. But do your remember Bad Moon Rising from ""Werewolf in London?"" I leave the others for you to discover. For me thought each song brings up actual places I have been. If you are new to Creedence you have a treat coming to you, as they are as unique now as when they recorded the music. Start your own revival.The Best of Creedence Clearwater Revival"
4,"Great music, plain and simple.","If you are a classic rock fan and you don't own this cd, shame on you. John Fogerty was a great songwriter and this is the CCR album that proves it to any type of music fan. Fun and addictive tunes make this a ""true"" greatest hits album."
5,Great collection,"As with most bands, what a fan considers a great song and deserving of being included on a greatest hits release is subjective. That being said, this release won't disappoint a Creedence Clearwater Revival fan. There's a lot of fine music here to enjoy and listen to over and over again."
5,AWESOME,"This is an awesome album, it features all of there great songs plus the sound is great as well, a must have, highly recommended."
5,It got me into Rock Music,"Creedence Clearwater Revival has exerted so much influence over modern rock music that it's not funny. Granted, John Fogerty's guitar abilities will never be confused with the likes of Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Hendrix, Clapton, or Santana, but the grittiness of the lyrics as well as the originality of the folk-rock put forth by this quartet is truly legendary. Add it to your collection NOW."
5,Voice of a generation.,"These songs were written in an era populated with angry youths who flocked to such bands as The Doors and the Jefferson Airplane because these bands vented the people's anger. But if these bands provided an outlet, CCR filled them again. CCR was not driven on anti-establishment lyrics, but by soul and a simple rhythm. This makes them wildly popular, this makes them refreshing, and this makes them a legend."
5,One of my all time favorite bands.,.You can't beat the price for this mp3 download. It has 20 of their biggest hits. I like that you can store it on your Amazon cloud and listen to it on any computer.
5,Great CCR music,Great music from the Creedence Clearwater Revival. Brings back a lot of memories listening to the sound of their music.
5,Hot Wax,"For the few of you that complained about ""tinny"" sound, Fogerty's place in the overall mix and found it not worth downloading or buying, here's a novel idea: Why don't you pick up the excellent vinyl pressing? You do have a turntable, don't you?"
3,some good some bad,"It is just my opinion, but,this cd contains some very good creedence, but the whole cd must be taken with a grain of salt as , to me, there are some songs on here I wouldn't really ask for,but , as expected, the band is very good,this was a A number one band and it is good listening,"
3,Not a Saleable Recording,"With all the recent chatter about Fogarty's successful return, you'd think they'd publish a better mix. The music's great as is Fogarty...when you can hear him. I've returned it as being not worth downloading or playing. The music in this album is all over the place. Better mixes exist."
2,"Songs are good, MP3s are bad",I downloaded the whole album - almost every song has the first few seconds of the introduction cut off. Very annoying. Ruins the album.
3,"Great songs, but...","I bought this, together with Volume 2 at a great price from another place. My only complaint about this set is that part 1 of Suzie-Q is on Volume 1 and part 2 is on Volume 2. What idiot thought it would be a great idea to split a song onto 2 separate discs?"
5,stainboy says,"This is truly the ultimate CCR Greatist Hits. I mean Chronicle Vol.2 is good as well, but this one takes the cake. It has an amazing 20 songs. All of them are excellent. Personally my favorite is Fortunate Son. I give it 5 stars. This is stainboy signing off."
5,One of the greatest rock bands of their time,"Of the 20 songs on this album, I guarantee that at least 17 of them seriously kick. The songs aren't deep, but they are all blessed with excellent lyrics and catchy tunes. Even though I don't mind experimentation in my music, when someone doesn't experiment, it is a definite plus. For anyone, especially those into classic rock, this is a must-buy"
5,love this very much,"I love pretty much all of these songs. I wish they put ""born on the bayou"" and ""midnight special"" on here but oh well. I bought this about 3 years ago when I was 16 and pretty much played it till I got sick of it then played it some more just because its great. This is literally the only cd I own that I think all the songs are good. The amazing thing is that one band could have so many great songs. Some bands are lucky if they make one memorable song. I think you could play ""Proud Mary"" or ""Bad Moon Rising"" to anyone and they could say they have heard that song or sing some lines from it. I think john fogerty is a brilliant man I wish I could go into his head and walk around for a while who knows what kind of songs he's hiding in there. So yes buy this I think you'll like it. the songs are simple but brilliant. Try it out the worst that could happen is you don't like it,though I doubt it, and you could give it to someone else, they would thank you I am sure."
4,Good CD,"This is a pretty good CD. It's fun to listen to and has a nice range of songs from CCR. Of course, there are always a few different songs they could have included to make it better but hey, overall, it's a good buy."
5,Creedence Rocks,"One of the few CD made on the face of this Earth that is worth the price. CDs are always overpriced, even when they are sold used for 7.99 or 8.99. Almost all the songs are pure, simple, and unforgettable. Creedence rocks. Buy it."
4,CCR to the rescue,I never bought any of their recording when I was younger. I'm glad I have one now.
5,Great album,Love it! All the old greats are here. I have this both on my Kindle Fire and also on the desktop.
4,down on the corner,"the good ol stuff, same as always...good to hear thesee songs again, it got me to go and buy a music book of ccr."
5,Chronicle of Credence Clearwater Revival,"I also grew listening to this group back in the mid 70's. Still listen to them now that I found their cd, used but in great shape.recommend it highly."
3,The Chronicle of Why iTunes Store Tracks Are Better,"Listen to the samples here versus the samples on Apple's iTunes. Amazon's encoding is terrible. Amazon's tracks and albums average about ten percent less than the same titles on the iTunes store. But you are getting about 50% less quality here at Amazon.You get what you pay for.Five Stars For Creedence, Two Stars Knocked Off For Amazon."
4,Very solid Band,"I simply do not know personaly about the individuals of the Band but they have alot of good quality songs that simply puts todays music to shame, because today,s music other than Contempory Christian music is just terrible and alot of times just plain old noise. GodBless"
3,The dynamic range is compressed out,"The cd I got was mastered in 1994, not 1990 like Amazon says. This matters if you prefer that music not have all the dynamic range compressed out. This cd is very loud, probably one of the loudest I own. I bought it because I though I would get a cd mastered in 1990, which would have the dynamic range intact.It's a good collection of songs. Get it if you like CCR but don't own any of their material. Just be aware that you may find the sound quality lacking if you prefer the more natural sound of intact dynamic range in music."
5,This is for anyone who THINKS they know real rock,"I like modern rock as much as or more than the next guy. Metallica, Disturbed, Jet, Smashing Pumpkins... all really, really cool bands. But CCR is the reason there ARE bands like that: raw sound, a unique voice (that STILL belts a great record or two nowadays) and great musicianship. All that while creating songs that are more persistent than the cave paintings at Lascuax or the Pyramids. This CD has all the major hits from CCR, including their flawless version of ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" (the fact that John Fogerty sings it ""I Hoid It Through The Grapevine"" somehow makes it even more appealing, all 11-plus minutes of it). The best thing is that it still sounds fresh. If you're a fan, buy the remasters of the albums. But if you're starting out on CCR (like me), run , do not walk, to buy this album. You can thank me later."
5,"Simply, excellent","Although the Chronicle Two also contains some delightful songs, this Chronicle One is really a hit-containing box. My favourite is and will always be ""Bad Moon Rising"" from the outstanding ""Green River"" album. Also ""Proud Mary"" and ""Up Around the Bend"" provide us with their great sense of making music. I would listen to this one over and over again.And if you really want more hits, Chronicle Two contains ""Cotton Fields"" (indeed a hit) and ""Before You Accuse Me"", plus other pretty melodies like ""Don't Look Now (It ain't you or me)"" and a strong one like ""Born on the Bayou"".Totally recommendable. Really essential pieces of collection!"
4,"Great, Great Songs, almost a 5.","They managed to put together 20 good, very good, or great songs with this greatest hits album. This is the perfect album for a casual RockNRoll fan, if they want to own some CCR. Covering songs like, ""Fortuanate Son, ""Bad Moon Rising,"" and ""Down On The Corner,"" and also giving you hits like, ""Down On The Corner,"" and ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine,"" and throwing in less widely know songs like, ""Who'll Stop The Rain?, my personal favorite, this is as close to a complete collection as it could be. This album many great songs.Basically, this is the perfect Greatest Hits album for a band like CCR. It is exactly what a greatest hits album should be. Get it, if you don't have it."
5,Gets me going in the morning,I've been listening to this CD for 2 weeks in my car on the way to work.
5,"No gimmicks and no flash, just quality hard rock.",Creedence are terrific because they are so tight musically and don't boast or flash because they don't have to.
5,Blast from the Past,"I bought this CD because I had watched the movie The Big Lebowski, and I realized how very much CCR influenced me when I was growing up. Was remembering how much fun and sorrow the music represented in my life. We know all about the band break up stories etc., but the great talent and demand for excellent vibes and lyrics made it last. Fogarty rules!"
5,5 STARS!!,this is the greatest CD ever...I recomend you buy it...cuz its worth the Money.And John is the greatest Songwriter ever
5,Solid Rock And Roll.,"CCR came on the scene with music deeply grown from the roots of rock. At a time Rock was being forced into more experimental venues such as ""acid"" or ""psychadelic"", CCR said this is where we came from and created a sound that was gritty, raw and true rock and roll."
5,Excellent CD!,Takes me back to my childhood. Every one of these songs still rocks me through and through.
5,Spice This Spice That,"Yet another great single from The Spice Girls.They had a string of hits from 1997 to 2000.Its amazing how many hits they had in such a short period of time.This is another i often listen to.They weren't around for very long,but they did produce some classic songs.This is another stand out song."
3,The song and video are good but the remix is dumb,"The Song is good but the remixes are stupid. AT the start of the Tony Rich Remix it goes ""REMIX! ah That's Right"" It sounds stupid, but when the guys are not talking it sounds ok. The video on it is small but it dose not run choppy."
3,good speakers cheap brackets,"typical cheap Chinese product, sound alright but hardware is garbage, one day I will learn and again buy North American only"
4,see them live,"don't just buy the cd...I don't think the CD can compare to their live show. I don't like the cd all that much just because it's slow most of the time, but it is really good music. Just don't expect ""punk"" or really anything I know of, maybe something like the band cursive, but other than that...yea. Just see them live and you'll love 'em. (esp. the cello)"
5,buy this cd now,"The new realease by MBD is quite possibly the best c-d i've heard all year. everyone i've played it for loves it. whatever style of music your into, give this a try. youll really really enjoy it..unless your narrow minded, or just have bad taste."
5,incredible,"I love this CD. Murder by Death are definetely some of the most talented musicians out there. They have very interesting instrumentation, which is part of what makes them stand out. I would describe their sound as a mix of the Cure, Cursive, and Carmina Burana. I have seen them live, and I must say that they will not dissapoint you, live or on the record."
4,Good Start,"I read this book because I like the column Mr. Clements writes for the Wall St Journal. I felt that even years after the recent market collapse, it would be a guide for the future even if I didn't lose it all.The book didn't disappoint.This book is a help getting the necessary insight to the individual investor like me.It get's a little complicated and detailed in places but the basics are here: saving, indexing, rebalancing, retiring.There is also insight - if you worry about your portfolio before retiring, it's worse when it's your main source of income.As Mr. Clements advises, you must learn some basics to be successful at investing.The ""experts"" you may hire have other agendas."
2,Not at all like the color in the picture!,I ordered this based off of the color displayed in the photo!!When I recieved the product I found that it was PLATINUM BLONDE! Not at all what I wanted!
2,Blonde and platinum blonde - are not the same!,"Good product, but it is difficult to have the difficult to pick the color you want. I join the previous review, I ordered a blonde color, and received a platinum blond. It is almost white, which makes my hair gray, and covers the scalp of dandruff. I'll try to order a medium brown and mixed colors for my desired shade."
2,Doesn't match,I have tried platinum blonde and light brown (one from another company) and they seem to have a problem with matching a golden blonde or dishwater blonde type colors. Just cannot seem to get it to work
3,Forgotten but useful basic,"Whether this book helps you improving your eyesight or not, it remains a useful basic, but forgotten, knowledge on vision. Even if you don't go into practicing the exercices that are in it, you have the opportunity here to come to understand the natural basics of eyesight. That will at least improve your mental vision! Made popular (?) by Aldous Huxley."
2,Even a brilliant thinker like Huxley can be conned.,"This book is difinitive proof that no matter how smart you are, you can still be conned. Much like the characters described in his ""Devils of Loudon"", Huxley convinced himself to believe the most foolish things, in this case, the Bates method. The Bates method has been proven time and time again not to work. Even in Huxley's time most people knew it was a hoax, but Huxley, with his love of the Eastern ""mind over body"" religions never even questioned it. He bought the lie hook, line, and sinker. Then wanted to sell it to you"
3,he's missed it....,"Three stars for a well written book, however did he not learn anything from Krishnamurti......"
3,THE TERMINATOR MEETS FIRESTARTER,"SPECIMEN is a molding of two other movies: ""Firestarter"" and ""The Terminator."" They even have the two aliens appear in the buff, cute little buns and all. Mark Paul Gosselaar plays Mike, a young man who has the ability to start fires; he is the spawn of an alien who impregnated his mother, and the aliens have sent a terminator type guy (played with muscular aloof by Douglas O'Keefe) to bring him back or destroy him (why, they never say). In steps another alien, Andrew Jackson, who we find out has closer ties to Mike.Mike teams up with a teacher and the local sheriff to understand what's going on; the sheriff (played dead pan by David Kerman) believes the story about Mike's birth, but Mike doesn't. How else can he explain his powers, though?Low budget and corny, SPECIMEN nevertheless works because there's a modicum of sincerity to its thin storyline. The special effects are chintzy, but the locale is beautiful."
3,Specimen - A movie so bad it is good,"I would almost consider the movie ""Specimen"" a high class ""B"" movie in the SciFi genre. If you liked the movie ""Firestarter"" with Drew Barrymore in the '80's, you may like this movie.Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Saved By the Bell) actually does a decent job in his role as Mike Hillary. In this, what I consider to be, a low buget film.Think of ""specimen"" as an updated version of the movie ""Firestarter."" Specimen has more of an alien feel to it, on a low budget scale. I am not into ""B"" type movies. However I can say I liked this movie. A movie so bad it's good.Recomended for the SciFi or ""B"" movie fan"
4,Tastes like saw dust but...,"It may taste like saw dust but it is really good for you. If you read the label and compare the amount of fiber you get with this cereal vs. other ""Fiber"" cereals, you will understand the taste. I put this in milk and eat it as if it is medicine not food and let me tell you it is pretty good tasting medicine. The portions are just right and I don't have to worry about the product getting stale, which is good because you get a whole lot in one case."
3,Kelloggs AllBran Buds vs ALLbran Original,"I had been purchasing Kelloggs AllBran Buds from Amazon however, they stopped selling them. I then ordered the AllBran Original from them which are only available in 1.76 oz. packages and am not pleased with them because:1. the price per serving is much higher and2. I do not care for them as muchhence, I will be buying the AllBran Buds elsewhere."
5,Does whats it's supposed to do.,"A good filter. Too bad 3M bought AEARO, as these are becoming harder to find. It wouldn't be so bad if they made something that fit my AEARO housing."
5,Delightful yiddishkeit fairytales to read and pass on.,"My grandfather wrote this book-I was raised on these stories, and loved them as a child. I now read them to my children and love to share all the morsels of a distant jewish culture, my roots, and theirs. I encourage all who wish to infuse a flavor of the world of the shtetl and the lives of Eastern European jews of past to read thos and his others, including my favorites, The wise Men of Helm, and the Wandering Beggar."
4,Mosquito Magnet Replacement Net,"Mosquito Magnet Replacement Net for Liberty Plus MM3100NETThis is the net for the 2008 Version of the Mosquito Magnet, called the Liberty Plus. It's larger and more expensive than nets for past models; but, it works!"
2,Contents are good but not detail enough to follow,"The book covers only a few complicated join, most of the join are very common and can be easily found in any wookworking book or magazine. The book shows a good collection of jigs. However, lacking of detail drawing do not help in making these jigs. Most of the time I have trouble understand what the piece look like or what angle in the drawing I am looking at. With a little more detail drawing or explanation, this book would be worth to considered otherwise I would not recommended."
3,Updated with a different title...,"FYI this book is true to its title. It is a tad dated by now (12/05) and the newer edition by same author is ""Corrective Lighting, Posing, And Retouching."" Ive thumbed through it at the local B&N. Unless there is some specific reason you need this edition, pick up the newer title."
3,Disclaimer needed?,"The title says ""Form a Partnership: The Complete Legal guide"" - I'm about halfway through the book, in Chapt. 9 p. 164 - (exact words) ""CAUTION: This chapter does not enable you to prepare a legal partnership yourself. This chapter does not include samples clauses for actually drafting a limited partnership agreement. In the absence of any excellent self help materials on the subject, you'll definitely need to see a lawyer.""I'll let you decide what that makes this book. - So if this isn't considered excellent self help material, what is it, trivia?"
4,A Tinseltown Story,"Robin Tamblyn's novel ""King of Hollywood"" follows the life of a man named Danny Spain, who grows up to be a promising Hollywood actor. But Danny has one fatal flaw - he is gay. Homosexuality still not being fully accepted in the film industry, Danny and his people try to hide his sexual preferences. But Danny's lifestyle will eventually catch up with him. Now, one of his friends wants to reveal the truth about Danny Spain's life.I absolutely enjoyed reading the book, because it shows you how a Hollywood life could be and how it could end. Interestingly, Tamblyn based the character Danny Spain on biographical details of an existing Hollywood actor who is rumored to be gay.Tamblyn's characters are all believable, thus the protagonist doesn't always behave in a lovable way. Tamblyn allows the characters to make mistakes, which makes them even more human.A very nice read, indeed!"
1,king of hollywood,"As a gay individual myself i found the book to be exreamly parronising. As far as the literary style goes it seems perfectly obvious to me and any half baked simpleton that the author has no grasp on the complexities of writing a birthday card, let alone a novel. How this book ever got published is simply beyond me."
5,"All in all, this was a remarkably good book.","I read this book and thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. The plot was wonderfully set out, and the author's writing style was very interesting. There were a lot of times when Jackson looked back on things that happened when he was little. The topic was a little too mature, but all in all, this was a remarkably good book."
2,Wondering...,"Once again I find myself wondering why writers of children's books feel the need to bring up subjects that should be discussed rather than read. The young boy in this story after being exposed to a terrible reality, instead of talking to someone about it decides to take on the task of saving his ex-babysitter by himself, and stealing his mother's car is just one the impulsive ways he tries to deal with the problem. Maybe if Cracker's age were two or three years older the whole story line could have been easier for me to accept. Although well written, and a topic needing more exposure, I'm not sure this is the proper forum for elementary readers."
4,Hungry for Cracker Jackson,"Cracker Jackson will make you hungry for more. I gave it four stars and three thumbs up. From Cracker driving the car, to Nicole in a coma, this book will make sure you never put it down. Even though Alma denies getting beat up by Billy-Ray, Cracker doesn't stop helping unless he knows she's safe. So, if your between the ages of ten and fourteen you will love this book. I liked this book because it gives alot of detail and clues. In this book, it delt with a possible real life situation. Also, it gave a vivid picture of what was going on. The dialoge they say brings you into the story. It's almost like you are a character in the book. So, if you are someone who is interested in cliff hangers and drama, then this is the book for you."

5,Byar's Best,"This is my favorite Betsy Byar's book. Cracker is a very sweet kid who tries to help his babysitter, Alma, who is being beaten by her husband. Even though the theme is serious, there are many funny parts too, like when Cracker's friend Goat tries to help Cracker by stealing his mother's car to drive Alma and her baby to a women's shelter. You'll love it!"
3,I like this song only...,"Of course I heard this song from xxxholic. Which me and my husband are so into. I don't know why some people are hating on the anime. It's so cool.Yes I love this song, I don't know why.It's really not my taste but it's cute. So I was able to hear the other songs and they are catchy just not my taste.I only like this song and manage to buy the mp3 for .99That's perfect for me. If you don't want to buy some import and spend so much $$, as per the previous comments just get the mp3.I am now looking for the ending credit song from the anime, which is a bit difficult to find. I may have to end up buying that one.Which we like better anyway."
2,Not for me,"The positive points brought up by the other reviewers are correct, almost everything about this metronome is awesome. I've got to return it because when you increase the tempo, it restarts the beat. Sorry but the way I practice is to play and bump it up or down a bpm every four bars or whatever, since it doesn't maintain the beat, this thing is no good to me."
5,Perfect Meter for Any Musician,"I am a drummer/percussionist of 20 years running now. And, the one thing I've noticed is that there are many non-percussion musicians that have bad meter. I'm not saying mine is perfect, but I do notice it when another musician is out of time. The Rhythm watch was designed for drummers/percussionists. And, it works great for that application. There are difference choices for the sound of the click, the BPM dial is very handy, and every time signature is available at a quick turn of a dial. I would also reccomend this metronome for non-percussion musicians, because it is a great way to practice your music and improve your meter at the same time."
3,"Seemingly durable, though thin flag material","Given its price, I was surprised and somewhat disappointed to see how thin the material of this flag is. It's about half the thickness of other ""all weather"" flags I have ordered in the past. On the positive side, its stitching is nicely done and the stars are well embroidered. After two months out in the elements, it shows no signs of wear or tear, but the real test will come after eight to ten months - the time at which all other brands of outdoor flags I've purchased started to significantly deteriorate, discolor, and tear. I'm hoping this one will outlast them"
2,Childish Read,"This book attempts to discuss the samurai but it is written as it was intended for children to read. The chapter on ninja truly was one fixed with Hollywood like fiction, i.e. the ninja having a glider-like flyer that they used to drop bombs on a castle. Also powders taht caused their target to laugh and could not be stopped, sort of like the joker from Batman, and finally mentioned that a throwing star could kill their enemy while they hid among the crowd. Absolutely not true. The throwing star was not a weapon that killed people. It was used more for a ""stop the chase"" weapon. I found this book to be poorly written and even more poorly researched in many areas. I truly would not recommend this book to anyone. I am sorry I even bought it."
4,Real Rock N' Roll Is Back!!!!!!,I first heard about the Soldiers when i got one of thier songs free with my iTunes subscribtion. That one song (Funny Little Feeling)blew my mind so i had to buy this record. I wasn't disapointed in the least. It's a great mix of punk and garage rock. Almost every song on here is excellent (the first 3 songs being the best). When i heard they were playing at Larkfest i had to go and i still haven't processed how incredable this band is live. If you ever get the chance to see them take it. They are only a few steps away from being the biggest band in the world.
3,nice flag,"it showed up pretty quick and it is a nice saints flag but it was too small for my garden flag stand (should have looked at the deminsions of the flag first). instead, i have it hanging in my front window, looks better there."
2,WTF???,"I am a Beatle fan. I have been one since they appeared on the music scene. I grieved when they broke up, but I grew to love them each individually as they ventured out on their own. I always loved Paul the best. Even though John (and George) wrote beautiful songs, they could never top Paul. So, having purchased his Sitting in the Backyard, or whatever the last album was (it was awful except for the song played in The Lake House), I was hesitant to buy Memory Almost Full, but the reviews convinced me. I wish I'd listened to my instinct. This album sucks. He comes across very pitchy, and the words are as bad as the music. It's like he's just writing to write, not because he has all this talent to share. A huge disappointment. Save your money. (But I still love you, Paul)"
1,Time to retire and rest on your laurels,"To say that I am disappointed in this compilation of McCartney music is an uderstatement. What was Sir Paul smoking when he conceived this idea? He has written these stupid essays and sung them into songs. And the essays are terrible and mindless.Sir Paul, you are 64 and I will still send you a valentine, if you stop writing trashy music. And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make. This one is sad.It is time to retire and rest on your laurels."
2,Disappointing!,"After seeing the magical and delightful Dance Tonight video I was eagerly anticipating this release. Sadly, this the third disappointing Macca release in a row. Driving Rain, Chaos & Creation, and Memory Almost Full are all mostly filler with only a few songs. The last great McCartney CD was Flaming Pie.There are only two really good songs here - Dance Tonight and Ever Present Past. The rest is pretty dreadful. The lyrics to the End of the End are poignant but there is no melody and the whistling is just annoying. The bonus tracks on the deluxe CD are neither special nor interesting.The last three Ringo releases have been far superior to the last three McCartney releases. My advice to Macca: Let Mark Hudson help you restore the magic!Frank Caesar BranchiniEdgewater, MD"
2,Talent Almost Gone,"You have to hand it to McCartney...he is a shrewd businessman for working this deal with Starbucks. The actual deal, however, is getting more attention than the content of the CD which is horrible. ""Ever Present Past"" is a rewrite of ""My Brave Face""...HELLO...doesn't anyone else see the similarity here? Print out the lyrics to ""Dance Tonight"" and read them. This song might actually have been ghost-written by his daughter Beatrice. I love most of McCartney's catalog and long for the days of Ram, Red Rose Speedway, etc. but i'm afraid he should have called this CD ""Talent Almost Gone""."
1,"If I could return the CD, I would.","I bought this with the expectation that Sir Paul would have interesting, original material. Instead, the lyrics are syrupy pablum and the overall effect is like a 60's bubblegum band. Perhaps Sir Paul should record a cover of ""Will you still by me when I'm 64?"" I most certainly will not.Ick."
1,I will be brief...,I love the Beatles and McCartney. I listened to this CD in the car. I thought it sounded half-finished and amateurish. Above all it reminded me how much McCartney owes George Martin. I was so disappointed with this CD that when I had finished listening to it I threw it out of the car window.
2,Surprised at all the good reviews,"I was hesitant to get this album but after seeing the Dance Tonight commercial and reading so many good reviews I decided to go ahead. I've been a Paul McCartney fan from the beginning through the children's video ""Rupert and the Frog Song"" and Band on the Run. With all the hype I was expecting to be elated by the songs on Memory Almost Full. Instead I heard myself repeatedly say ""I've heard this before. He's just repackaging the familiar. The only truly overflowing with life track was Dance Tonight. It seems he wrote it in the kitchen with his family present, after the entire album was recorded. In Dance Tonight you can tell Paul is happy. The others songs have a forced undertow. If he can maintain the vitality he brought forth in Dance Tonight for his next album then we might have some great music."
4,Mom's happy,"Gave this to my mom (huge Beatles/McCartney fan) as a surprise ""just because"" gift and she loved it. She had heard the single before and said that the entire album was just as good. Haven't heard it myself yet, but she's pretty picky. :)"
5,Memory Almost Full [Deluxe Limited Edition],"Paul has done it again, the music is great! I am biased; I like all of the music produced by any ex-Beatle. This album has a real variety of songs and is just great in my opinion!Larry Baker, Tulsa Ok"
4,No mediocrity here,"No matter how many times Paul McCartney shifts, he always comes back strong. This album is easily his best since the ""Flowers in the Dirt"" - ""Off The Ground"" period. Sgt. Pepper overtones abound here, but not for merely the sake of nastalgia. Paul is completely in his element here, no pretention; pure honesty. ""Mr. Bellamy"" is a return to Ram's whimsical spirit mixed with Revolver's writing at random (i.e. Eleanor Rigby). There's a bit of Abbey Road in ""The End is Not The End"". I use the references for just that. Those looking for a return to the good old days, will be comforted in knowing that he's the same today as he's always been, but there's also change as well. It's a paradox to be sure, but an interesting one. I love every song and I'm glad to say I find no mediocrity here!"
4,Brother's Gift - Paul McC,My brother was really impressed with his Birthday Gift. I can only go by his reaction. He would probably rate it a 5 but I'll give it a 4 on this occasion.
3,Much better than Chaos but still falls short,"Paul's new release is not great but it is good. Best song hands down is ""That Was Me"" which is classic McCartney where Paul actually sounds like the guy who wrote McCartney and Ram. His vocals throughout Memory are strong which was nice to hear because on Chaos his singing sounded old and strained on many tracks. He also mixes up the songs with a couple of upbeat tunes to counter the ballads. A marked difference to the slow, plodding songs on Chaos. All in all, a far more inspired album than his last effort but it's not a stunner. BnB Beatles Depot"
1,Memory Almost Trashed,"Thanks Paul.And...what's with the cover art?Paul McCartney shows his supreme irrelevance on this CD.I wonder what the Queen must be thinking as this is NOT worthy of a Queens Knight.Paul, Beatle or not...I cannot believe you would release this dribble.OK..Ringo just became my favourite Beatle."
4,"Good, but not fabulous","Paul McCartney has written some of the defining melodies of twentieth century music. Obviously, he is a great and in a class of his own.And what about this effort? My judgement at present (these things do change) is the second half of the CD is better than the first half. The album is not fabulous, but it is good.Other reviews have not mentioned this, but I find the song ""You tell me"" haunting, poetic, and absolutely beautiful."
4,Good reception,Installed this antenna on my 1983 GMC truck. Pulled the instrument panel face off and slid it up under the dash. Works great. I didn't hook up the amp lead and it works fine. Screwed the ground into an instrument panel screw and it seemed to make a slight difference in clarity.
1,"May work for some, but not me.","I have a broken end on my factory antenna wire which plugs into the head unit, so instead of trying to find a replacement end and having to solder it, I figured I'd try this windshield mounted antenna. It did not bring in distant stations as well as the factory antenna, and it seemed to overmodulate the stations it did get. Also you have to bend the antenna slightly to get reception, so it seems like your body is actually doing the job. I tried several ground points, with and without the power wire, and nothing worked. It could be just a defective unit, but I'm not going to waste any more time on this type."
2,Only if you have no other choice,Use this only if you have no other choice. Works better than no antenna but if at all possible use an exterior anntenna.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Bought this to replace a broken power antenna. I looked on Amazon and saw this and figured it was worth a try. It wasn't. We live in Seattle with many many stations on FM and AM. After hooking this up to our JVC head unit, we could not pick up any station on an auto scan. I was able to tune them in manually, but the reception was horrible. I saw in the reviews that many people had disconnected the power wire, so I tried it without the booster. Double checked the ground wire, Still horrible reception, still no stations on the auto scan. Bottom line - you may be one of the lucky people that this works for, but I would not recommend it at all."
1,not worth the money,"would have been nice if it would have worked, had to go back to the old antenna, time expired so i could not return"
1,HORRRIIIBBBLLLEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst out of all my experiences with antennas!!! I am some what of an audio freak so I have alot of experience with antennas and I could not stand the crappy signal that I COULD NOT receive with this hunk-o-junk!!! I tried multiple mounting areas and the best signal I picked up wasn't good enough to even listen to comfortably let alone support my hd radio!!! I would not recommend this product to any one!!! The signal pick up with the power amp hooked up is no better than with out it hooked up and they are both HORRIBLE!!!
4,installation,I installed this in a horizontal position which did quite well until the antenna pointed directly at the stations ... a vertical orientation probably would have avoided this issue.now that it is glued to the window hard to change the alignment.still it works pretty well giving me almost as good reception as my old antenna and much better than after the antenna was broken off.
4,The Thomas Guide,"A good book if you are new to the area or to keep in your car for a quick reference. It has clear, detailed, easy to follow maps of specific areas. A definate must have, especially for those who (like me) have no sense of direction."
4,"Great cheap set, but weird packaging?","This set is very cheap compared to some of it's other releases, however, the DVDs are set in an odd order.Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan (Movie 8)Bio-Broly (Movie 11)Broly Second Coming (Movie 10)I know which movies are which so yes, I can just move Second Coming to where Bio-Broly is and vice versa, but for those who don't know will be watching them out of order :/"
4,Industrial Equipment Protection,"These RS-232C surge protectors seem to work just like any standard surge protector, isolating each of the nine pins most likely through varistors to catch any voltage leaks that would normally cause damage. I currently have 3 of these hooked up to an industrial DE-9 multiplexer and they seem to be doing their job just fine. My only gripe is these are enormous 1-1/2 x 3 x 3/4 inches which is typical a great deal bigger than a normal DE-9 end which make them exceptionally difficult to install on a piece of lab equipment which has multiple RS-232 ports in very close proximity."
5,Very good,"As usual, Bernard Cornwell gives us a lesson on History through his delicious character Richard Sharpe. I love this series."
3,Great book - not so great reader,"I've read all of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels and - years ago - listened to some of the audiobook versions. Sharpe's Eagle is an early one and one of the best. The reader of this audio version, however, doesn't really capture the tone of the characters for me. Sharpe is a rough, up-from-the-gutter soldier; Patrick Harper is an Irishman from the country. The narrator's upperclass (and somewhat condescending) version of the British accent is disconcerting and distracting. Having said that, I'm enjoying reconnecting with the story and the characters and will probably get used to the reader's voice after a while."
5,great reading you are there,"I HAVE READ ALL OF HIS BOOKS ALL THE SHARPS SERIES AND THE FOUR BOOKS ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR IM waiting for the him to complet the series,all so the other series about the archers find me more thank you DON"
4,"First in the series - Napoleonic wars, footsoldier's view","First in the series, ""Sharpe's Gold"" gives the reader a vivid sense of warfare and adventure. These are good books to read if you've enjoyed Hornblower (C S Forester), Aubrey/Maturin (Patrick O'Brian), or Bolitho (Alexander Kent) novels. They are easier to read and less crowded with fact - ornithology, sailsmanship - than O'Brian's books. There is quite a bit of repetition from book to book - Sergeant Harper's amazing seven-barreled rifle is explained often enough to begin to sound preposterous. But it's probably true - the author has researched the subject thoroughly.If you want more literary merit there's Stendahl (""The Charterhouse of Parma"") or Tolstoy (""War and Peace"") to cover the same territory in more depth -- and just as vividly.Surprisingly the actor who plays Sharpe in the TV series looks a lot like John Wayne did in 1933."
1,Poor and disapointing,Typically for the British:1. Lack of objectivity2. Lack of humility3. Eagerness to blame the foreigners4. The nationalistic bias5. FEEL-GOOD atmosphere
5,Stirring adventure fiction,"""Sharpe's Eagle"" is ""The Triumph and the Glory"" of the Napoleonic War novels. What Rustad's WWII novel does for the Second World War, Cornwell's skill has done for this earlier era. I'm more familiar with war novels about 20th Century conflict, but greatly admired Cornwell's Civil War books so thought I'd give his Richard Sharpe books a try. I'm glad I did! He brings his gift for drama, flair for characterization, and vouminous knowledge of the military art to the fore with ""Sharpe's Eagle."""
4,Sharpe's Eagle flies!,"I have read many historical novels in my life and this one ranks high on the list. Cornwell does a very adequate job of conveying the feeling to you that the society of Britain is changing due to the coming of mass industrialization and the changes in class based military that eventually put merit before social standing. His use of analysis of the actual battlefield tactics of the Napoleanic era is fascinating and although the work is fiction I believe that a student of European history would find this to be a useful work to ""get in the mood"" to study more mudane and boring aspects of the time period. I would recommend this as a suitable book for a highschool history class or early college history major."
5,Sharp story,"Napoleonic wars are not my thing but one day I picked up this book and for want of anything to do I read it.Didn't know some British officers were promoted from the ranks during this period. Always thought they purchased their commissions.These things got pitched aside with this delightful story.Richard Sharpe, a man who has literally crawled up from the ranks to a commission, finds himself in a bad place with a bad superior officer and there is only one way for him to extricate himself from it.This novel is well worth reading."
3,"Fun ""mind candy"" historical fiction","Before reading this I'd only read Cornwell's Civil War-related series, and it was immediately apparent that he is *much* more comfortable with this Napoleonic Wars setting. His facts seem far more accurate and more fluent, his characters' dialogue is more believable, and I overall get the sense that he simply has a better grasp of his material. This is the story of the young career Army man Sharpe, who finds himself in political hot water through no fault of his own, and who has to do something heroic to get himself out of it. The battle scenes are good, very detailed; the characters, as I've come to expect with Cornwell, are generally engaging though not particularly deep. I intend to read the rest of the series."
5,SHARPE FOREVER,BERNARD CORNWELL HAS DONE IT AGAIN WITH THIS VERSION OF THE LIFE OF RICHARD SHARPE. WHEN YOU START TO READ ABOUT SHARPE IT IS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.
1,Absolutely Worthless,"The seal is made out of a semi-rigid plastic that will not adjust to different face shapes, so it doesn't come even close to being able to form a seal for most people. It will leak like a sieve. If you wear safety goggles, the breath escaping from around your nose will fog them in no time, creating a safety hazard. This mask is also very uncomfortable - the seal (if you can call it a seal) has several hard spots that create welts on your face. Don't waste your money on this; buy a mask that you know will make a snug, comfortable seal all the way around."
1,Not fun for more than 15min,"My 2.5 year old finds these very frustrating. You have to have some skill to build anything as everything must be counter balanced in order to stay up. Also, there's nothing else to do with these except build pyramids. And I had to spend a lot of time training my son not to throw the very heavy balls. So maybe it's his age but even so, I was bored with these after 15 minutes. They are shelved until he's older."
4,Love this toy,I'm a grandma of 2 boys ages 2 & 4. I bought it for the 2 year who links things together but the 4 year old is really into it. I found it fun to play with too. Will definitely buy other units to go with this one
2,Guidecraft 72-pc.,"Weak magnets this product is not as good as one would think, this toy wants to be but its just a sad little toy with a weak magnet system...Positive vs negative pressure makes zero difference in regards to the cool performance and non creativeness of this product..."
4,Only four stars.....five would need better building ability,"We bought these for our 22mo and 5.5yo boys for Christmas. I am SO glad we did. I agree that if you don't cross-brace the building, they fall down. But my boys and I learned that just by looking at the pics on the box.My little one likes to make a microphone and my older one makes dumbells and does his ""ex-uh-gise"".Neither are into truly building structures and I like these as an alternative to 7,000 lego pieces laying around.Lightweight, durable, colorful. Definitely worth what we spent. Even has encouraged both of them to pick up the other toys so they can play with them."
1,Magnets are too weak to build anything,"The idea is nice, but the magnets are too weak to build a structure like the one shown in the picture. As soon as you get to the second level, the entire thing starts twisting and colapses."
2,The magnet is too weak.,I bought his for my 2 1/2 year old grandchild in spite of several negative comment regarding the magnet. I am sorry I did because she gets frustrated every time she tries to play with Magneatos. The pieces are fairly large and weighty but the magnets are too weak to hold up the simplest of structure my grandchild tries to built. I would not recommend Magneatos to anyone.Disappointed Grand Dad
3,Not our favorite...,"My son (age 3) becomes very frustrated with this toy because his structures fall down easily and without warning. The magnets do not seem strong enough. This toy has rarely been played with and we have had them for a year. Besides the magnet strength, this toy seems to be of excellent quality and looks attractive."
3,Decent magnet blocks,I would have to say I'm a little disappointed. I expected them to stick together a little better for building. They aren't the strongest attaching magnets. My son basically just throws the balls around now.
2,Disappointing,"This looked like the perfect toy for my preschool-age sons, but we've been very disappointed with it. The pieces are extremely durable, but the magnets are not powerful enough to hold a structure together. Unless you build something that is shaped like a pyramid (like in the photo), it collapses immediately. My children immediately lost interest."
1,"Weak magnets, zero creativity","Our three kids have zero interest in this toy. You can hardly build anything with it, the magnets are not strong enough to hold any structure together. It just frustrates my kids as it collapses constantly."
5,Kids love them!,"I got a set of these for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. His 4-year old sister almost started fighting with him to play with them.Now that he has had them for a little more than a week, my daughter reports that he still spends hours building towers with them and then knocks the tower down, laughs and starts over again. Needless to say, she finds some of the parts in the oddest places after a ""knock down"".Both of the kids seem really amazed by the way magnets will stick together on one end and repel each other with the other end.I think this is a fantastic toy. Simple toys like this seem to be the most fun for kids and gives them a chance to use their imaginations.I recommend this toy highly. (even my 26-year old son and I had fun with them.)"
4,Great Toy,"This toy is great fun as it allows a lot of creativity for different things to build. My 3 yr. old enjoys them as they are easy to use and connect very well.My only downside, thus a rating of 4 vs. 5, is that they collapse easily if stacked up too high. This is due to the weight of the pieces causing the straight connector pieces to literally slide around/down the ball connector pieces (since there is not a single connection point that is fixed, but they can be connected to any point on the ball). So, this causes everything to collapse.This can be frustrating for a young child (e.g. 3 yr old, etc.) since they don't understand why it falls so easily.However, it's still a great product and I recommend it, as long as you are aware of this point."
5,great running shoe,"I really like this shoe. It's quite lightweight, and yet does not sacrifice on cushioning. I'm 6'3"", 218 pounds, and running two miles every other day (with some sprinting here and there) doesn't hurt my feet at all. It's super breathable. I can feel air gush in and out as I lift off and return. Last but not least, it's a very attractive looking shoe."
4,Good first impression,Ordered this when I has apparent surge issues feeding back via ethernet. Easy to install; absolutely hasn't affected internet speed on any computer or device. Giving only 4 stars initially since it's new and we'll see how it works over time.
5,Excellent!!!!,"""Orion's Hounds"" is an excellent addition to the TREK universe of novels. I highly suggest that you read it."
1,Dissapointing Mess,"This was a very dissapointing book, but considering the first two books of this series I guess I shouldn't have expected much.THe characters were not developed, the plot was repetitive, and frankly, not very interesting.Once again, the diversity/inclusionist theme was pushed way too hard, so much so that it definitely devalued the plot. I don't like reading propoganda, especially when its written under the guise of something else. Of COURSE the star trek crews are diverse-thats a GIVEN! It was never something that required force feeding, either to the reader or to the characters.Very poor, not recommended."
3,Titan,"I loved the first two Titan books. This book however was so so. I the first set of plot twists were good, but after that there are creatures that I think should have been left in the TV show and in this new part of space I was hoping for new ""monsters"" or non sentient beings. I think this author was trying to show how clever they are. I just didnt put it down and say. That was a good reading. still that is my opinion. I will read just about anything the franchise puts out."
3,Good book...not great.....,"I thought that this was a nice book. It is not the best ST: Titan book, but there have not been that many written so far, compared to the other series, so it is all good. The story fits the timeline set by the first two books pretty well. I have the paperback version, but having moved around some since I bought it years ago, I do not know where it is, so I bought the e-book version via Amazon so I can read it on my tablet when I am on the road or wherever and save space. I read through it on my Kindle Fire pretty quick.I enjoyed this title and think you will too."
5,William Powell shines!,"I must admit, I viewed this movie primarily for the scenes between Powell and Loy, but ""The Great Ziegfeld"" exceeded my expectations. The supporting cast, particularly Louise Rainer, was excellent. The musical numbers were shown in typical MGM splendor. Powell gives a wonderful performance and, as usual, he and Loy are lovely together. I loved it! It definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar (and I think Powell was robbed of a Best Actor Oscar)."
3,Worth watching once.,"Interesting movie, bait too melodramatic. Would have been better with more on actual shows. Scene with multi level set was amazing."
4,Luise Rainer steals the show!,"Great movie for stage and movie buffs.Outstanding costumes and sets. Seems a little long at times, but length is overcome by the high quality of the acting put forth by the lead characters.Luise Rainers portrayal of the first Mrs. Zeigfeld is the most memorable performance in the film. In the movie, her phone call to Zeigfeld to congratulate him on his second marriage will leave you with a broken heart . No wonder she won an Oscar for her performance! You won't regret buying this movie."
4,"""Ziegfeld"" Merely Good","I'd be a little kinder to this film if it hadn't won the Best Picture Oscar. Adding insult to injury is that ""Dodsworth"" didn't win. The debits here are overlength, superficial storytelling, skindeep biographical study, and generally weak production numbers. To it's credit the film contains strong performances by William Powell, Luise Rainer, Myrna Loy, and Frank Morgan. Good cameos by Fanny Brice and Ray Bolger. The production does have stunning direction and costume design. ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is not a bad picture but it barely transcends curio status."
4,Really good dance compelation,This was almost as good as Let's Hear It For The Boys which I own all of. Not all songs are the original artist but overall I really enjoy them. And the album are is fantastic also.
1,this is horrible,"I just received the CD. I am a beginner and the calls are fast, but audible. What I don't like is the music which is more like bad synthsized disco than ""swing your partner"" type. I wouldn't waste your money on this CD, especially since its higher priced than some of the others."
5,Mellow Classics,"My father has Jackie Gleason's music,and I really enjoy listening to the talent of this master of music.I found Jackie Gleason music available on Amazon.I researched what was available,and I am very happy with this choice.Pour you and your wife a glass of wine,lower the lights and AWAY YOU GO!"
5,great condition,"im pretty sure you've already seen both of these movies so i wont talk about it but i will tell you that you get 2 movies for the price of one and the quality is amazing. most of the movies from the 90s and before that they put on dvd suck in quality but this one does not and they have special feature like the biographies of the cast and some of the crew mainly just the director and on thin line between love and hate they have commentary from the director most of the time they dont have featues like this for movies before 2000, oh and before i forget they have wide screen and full screen so you get to choose. long story short yes its worth your moneyps. i almost forgot this, the movie came to my house 3 days after i ordered it, can you say fast delivery!"
1,Waste of time and money spent!,"I finally opened my box to watch two good black movies back to back, but I was very disapointed.I received Love Jones, but Thin Line was not in my box.I didn't return the item back because I'm disabled and didn't want the hassle.This was a complete waste of time and money spent!"
5,2 in 1,"Haven't watched either one but they were brand new, still in the wrap so I know they're watchable. Both have good actors and that's why I picked these."
5,Love Jones/Thin Line,This was a great deal!!! Two good movies for the price of one!!! Larenz Tate and Nia Long brings the romance on in Love Jones and Martin Lawrence gives a valuable lessson for anyone who thinks they may want to be a playa!!! :)
5,One of those all night readers,"Is injured and he forces himself into her home. How could a man like that be incredibly sweet and sensitive, but he is. The characters are not cooky cutters, more realistic and therefore believable. I real keeper!"
1,20/20 and Lost are showing a network loseing it's priorities....,"With our troops dying in Iraq and Afganistan, a news magazine does a story on one of it;'s TV shows...Why? It is useless and meaningless and has all the journalism qualities of a bad infomerical. ABC is repulsive."
4,"Nice ""sea serpent"" type dragon","Love the design of this figure, really looking like a lantern fish/sea serpent.Some of these figures have issues with the base peg being too small for the figure, and the figure will stand unstable as one of the fins extends under the base. Personally, mine didn't have that issue.Two versions, the one picture with the sea green spines, and one where the spines are beige. Be willing to get either, if you order."
5,Amnesia Helps Scoundrel Become Saint,"I loved this book! Set at the end of the Revolutionary war, it shows the role of ships, both Navy and independent, in helping the colonists to win. It also shows how Paul Winslow, introduced in previous books in the series, finds his place in life and comes to Christ. The storyline is unique and fascinating. The characters are adventurous and interesting. The reader can't help but want everything to work out well for all. Another well-researched and inventive story by Gilbert Morris."
3,Rather boring,"I love the House of Winslow seris ""dont get me wrong"" but this story was dull and boring to me. I got very sick of reading all about blood, and war. Morris spent a great deal of time describing all of battles in detail. It was fine the first time, but then I was done. I was mad about the way that Daniel Greene was treated. He just wanted to love a girl and have her love him back. But know that is never good enough for these woman. They have to have the Winslow men. I never got it. I had to make myself finish the story, it seemed like it would never end. I am hoping that the next book in this seris in better"
4,Saintly Buccaneer,"The ""Saintly Buccaneer"" is the fourth book in the Winslow Family Series that I have read. I love them all because they not only tell an interesting story, they fill me in on history as well."
3,"""Thee"" Saintly Buccaneer","A decent addition to the series, fans of the House of Winslow will not be disappointed. The action scenes are well written, and the book is a definite page-turner. The only two things that bugged me were some historical inaccuracies, and a few grammatical errors. The book contains a few references to characters serving in Nelson's navy at Trafalgar (which occurred 25 years after the events depicted in this book), and Admiral de Grasse's name is misspelled throughout. Those oversights are not really that big of a deal compared to the misuse of ""thee"" and ""thou."" One would think that an English professor and former pastor would have a handle on when to use one versus the other, but alas, every time Dan Greene spoke, it came across as stilted and unrealistic. This happened enough to be annoying. Overall, a solid novel, and I will definitely be reading the next in the series. Thou shouldst, as well."
3,Funny & cynical,"I have not stop to laugh while reading that book. It show how easy it is to be dupe when you hear what you whant to hear. Knock, the charlatan, abuse his rich clients in a funny way. He is a cynical man, who has no respect for rich people. We migh learn a lot through him. That book is very easy to read and to play. It is for all ages. I recommand it."
5,Attractive,"This graces my front flower bed and there are always beautiful birds around.The price was unbelievable and it is very attractive add on. I shopped around for some time for something like this & thanks to you, this was exactly what I was looking for."
3,It was nice but....,"The bird feeder arrived quickly and was large, but came with a large crack in the plastic on top. It was a gift so that was embarrassing but she still seemed to like it. Other than the fact it looked cheap, it was a pretty good buy for the money."
1,Disapointed,The cover was missing and the roof was broken. It was clear to me that it was packaged that way as no parts were found in the box. I used duct tape and repaired the roof.
1,Cheap...,"This lasted a week. One windy day cause the cord to break and crashed on the deck. Now, it is just an expensive pile of plastic ribble."
3,Broken on arrival,"This was very cheap, so I don't know how fair it is to complain. But it's such cheap plastic that it was broken during shipping. So the product is worth the money but I don't think I will buy from the same seller again bc of packaging."
2,"Doves love it, unfortunately","This holds a lot of seed as described, but unfortunately the edges are too large/deep, which enables mourning doves to sit and eat to their hearts' delight. I wasn't intending to directly feed the doves, only other birds. It does look nice hanging in my backyard, even if it's empty. I'll keep hunting for a better feeder."
3,no pole,When I orderd this product I read all the reviews. Some of them said that this bird feeder came with the pole. That was not true for me. There was not pole to hang it from in the box. I am trying to buy one on amazone but they seem to be almost twice the price of the bird feeder.
4,Gazebo Bird Feeder,This bird feeder is very pretty and old fashioned looking. Holds 2 pounds of seed so you don't have to refill as often and the birds love it too. We have lots of finches and sparrows and lots can fit on this feeder.
3,A LITTLE CARE WOULD BE NICE,"Nice item, but it was damaged AND not in the shipping. When the person whose Christmas gift it was took it out of the gift bag, there was a whopping great chunk of the bottom missing AND it was not in the gift bag or box. No care in packing it was taken. They had to see when it was packed, it was damaged big time."
2,Cherry Valley Lighthouse Bird Feeder,"I was very disappoined in the product. It turned out to be plastic, not ceramic like I the one I had purchased in the past. I went back to the site and could not find where the seller states that the product is plastic. It does not compare to the ceramic Lighthouse Bird Feeder I currently own. The seller should identify this item as plastic and not have it a suprise to the buyer when it arrives at their home."
1,Disappointed,"To be fair I purchased a used or returned item which was the Cherry Valley Delux Gazebo Bird Feeder. When it arrived it had no top for the feeder which without out the feed would get wet every time it rained and it didn't come with any fastners to connect the feeder to a tree,etc so it couldn'be hung up. That has been my one and only experience purchasing a returned item and it will be my last.I was to receive a full refund from back in the beginning of March and I am still waiting for it."
2,no cardinal,I thought this came with the cardinal - was disappointed with that - it is pretty cheaply made the nice things is that it holds a lot of seed - less refills.
4,HARD TO FILL BIRD FEEDER,"COSTMETICALLY PLEASING TO THE EYE , nice to look at . The perch is too close to the feeder causing the birds to have to sit sideways . yes , I speak for the birds as we have regular customers at our feeders . I forgot , it is also hard to fill because the opening is too small ."
1,Lasted only one week.,"I was excited about this feeder because it held a lot of seed, which meant me not filling it every other day. Well, I found it shattered on the ground after one week. The plastic is thin and cannot support the weight. A waste of money!"
4,Cute,This is a cute style and I looked forward to putting it out to watch the birds. It has not disappointed us. We are very happy with itl
4,It is a very nice birdfeeder.,"This birdfeeder is attractive, well contstructed and will hold LOTs of bird feed. The only drawback is if you use it as a pole mount it might need a little modification. We ended up packing a two-sided tape around the pole and then mounting to give a little more stability, but that has worked great for us. Overall I would recommend this product."
2,"Beware any birdfeeder that has a plastic top, squirrels will eat through it!!!","I was amazed, I didn't think they were this strong, but in only a couple weeks time, squirrels ate through the TOP plastic covor of the birdfeeder, not the clear plastic seed viewing area, but the top covor of it. And I had it hanging a couple feet below the branch but that didn't stop them. Right now there is a 2"" hole in the plastic top of my birdfeeder that was eaten away by the squirrels and sometimes I actually see a squirrel inside the feeder. I haven't heard of this before, but I guarantee it happened to me.Now I'm looking for a new feeder but among other squirrelproof things I want them to have, they HAVE to have a metal top and specify it in the description, the squirrels (or maybe they're super-squirrels) ate through the plastic top of my current feeder."
5,birdfeeder,This was a perfect birthday gift for my father and he really is happy with this birdfeeder. He really likes the quality and size of it. He really enjoys watching all the birds that the birdfeeder brings to his yard.
3,"Great looking Birdhouse, but","See my review on packaging of this item. The Birdhouse comes fully assembled. The box it arrived in was large enough to have held two of these. The box had no sign of damage it looked as if it had just been assembled. The Birdhouse on the other had had a section of the roof broken out. We opted for me to repair the roof line. (tape glue, paint and hang the repair away from our line of sight.) It will hold a 5LB bag of feed. I suggest you do not start with a full load. I also suggest you check the knot in the supplied wire for hanging. I did not, the knot held the house, held the 5 pounds of feed, I think it was the squirrel that took it over the limit. However the house held together and had no damage from the fall. I am now ordering something to assist in keeping the squirrels at bay."
2,Wish I had read reviews before purchasing,"I did not have time to enjoy this purchase. We filled it with birdseed and not 2 minutes after hanging it, it fell and broke. I had securely hung it with the wire that was attached. The wire did stay, however the rest of it feel. I would not purchase this product again. So sad because it's a pretty feeder."
1,overpriced,It looked bigger and beatiful. When I received it I was discontent but the price of the product was 17.20 and I paid 46.99. I said probably it was a mistake and they charged me the right amount. What a surprise. I was charged 46.99 and not the combined amount when you bought the seed for the birds together. I called amazon and they told me to speak with outdoor livings. They said the product was 46.99. What a rip off. Becareful buying things online these days. I have been buying things in the internet for years without any problem but I will stop this practice. It is better to see the product with your own eyes first.
3,Not Really What I Expected,"First of all, if you are looking to buy a small birdfeeder - this is not the product for you! This birdfeeder came in one of the largest boxes I have seen in quite some time, and there was very little packing around the birdfeeder itself.When I went to hang the birdfeeder on the side of my house, it promptly fell off its hook and immediately broke in several places since the plastic it was made of is not of the best quality.The birdfeeder does look nice when it comes out of its packaging, but be wary and be very careful as you put it up."
2,Pretty while it lasted,"This feeder is really cute, but lasted less than a week in my yard. The squirrels destroyed the rails and sat in it."
3,OK for a dry climate,"The feeder itself is pretty decent for the price. As for squirrels getting through it, well, you have to fight the squirrels on your own, that's not the feeder's fault. However, it has a wide gutter all around, where the birds perch to eat. The gutter catches all the seed hulls, chaff, and various garbage from teh feeder. The gutter turns to a near solid mass of gunk after the first rain. The drain holes are clogged or bloacked, and all the stuff in teh gutter just sits there wet & soggy, and quickly has 2 negative effects. First, once it builds up to the top of the gutter, it effectively stops the fresh seed from coming out of the dispensing holes. Second, you'll have a nice moldy smelly mess if you don't clean it out often. I am going to try drilling a few larger holes all around, but otherwise, unless you live in a dry climate, you might be better off with a feeder that has perches like wires or sticks for the birds, instead of this solid shelf."
3,My new bird feeder,The only problem I had with this bird feeder is the fact you cannot take it apart to clean it.I was a machinist so I resolved the problem myself if anyone is interested in how I resolved the problem please email me at therodologist@aol.com and I will send a picture of the feeder after I resolved the problem or I can post it on this site.Please click on the link below to see a slide show of how i resolved this problem.[...]
2,Very Pretty but Not Great Quality,I saw this exact feeder at a local store. This feeder looks really nice but the plastic is really cheap. This was not designed with any thought for the poor birds. The perching area is narrow and slippery. I decided on a cedar gazebo and the birds love it.
4,cherry valley coach lamp bird feeder,I really like them. i ordered two of them I would highly recommend them.They are really pretty and serve their purpose.
5,SUPER BRIGHT!! :: these are GREAT!,"I must say, i love these bulbs!I had them in my 97 tacoma, they were amazing. People would flash thier lights @ me all tha time, when i only had my l0w beams on. They were also really great from blinding people @ night, they were just bright enough to annoy people when u were behind them.These bulbs are Great, i only wish i could find them for my new Truck!"
2,Not so good,"Way too short for the money, then ABC deletes material ""thats not available for home use"" Hello?? That is pretty lame"
5,texas bad girls get good reviews,"I read this book the day I bought it. I thought it was a well researched, and was very well written. I enjoyed reading about the history of these women. I hope the author will write one about those bad Texas men to go with it. The author seems to have a flare for writing about historical events as if he was actually there. It was great."
2,A Disappointment,"Great potential for a fun, interesting read is often wasted in ""Texas Bad Girls."" The author has some fine story-telling skills, and some of the yarns are genuinely fascinating. Unfortunately, the author seems in love with his own cleverness, and ruins a good many of the stories by inserting distracting quips and jokes. The humor works sometimes, but too often it serves to mark this book as the work of an amateur, one step up from a vanity project.The author appears to have done a great deal of original research, but explains none of it and cites no sources beyond a bibliography of older books and articles at the back. This, along with the wise-acre writing style, robs the book of credibility. I think Mr. Butts has potential as an entertaining writer of light history, and I'd like to see him set his standards a little higher."
5,naive bassist rates highly,"I have a blue GSR200 of the early variety with three knobs. It is my first bass, and I am very happy with it. The range of bass sounds that can be produced by the two sets of pickups and some knob twiddling is really mind blowing. In my opinion, this is the bass to start with. It sounds marvelous.Regards,proclus[...]"
5,Magnificent funky-house single spinned intensely by Carl Cox,"If your'e an enthusiast on the rave scene you'll love this magnificent groovy example of house gone funky. I will drive crazy anyone who like to enjoy a party ""Until the Day""."
2,Decent information on PDH and SDH but beware errors!,"The book provides good coverage of the evolution of SONET and the intricacies and ""problems"" associated with PDH. There's even good coverage of SDH. However, beware of the sections on SONET rings. They are poorly written, misleading and in some instances downright wrong! Unfortunately, one or two inaccuracies can make one leary about the entire book."
2,Not the best quotes ever!,"I was disappointed that I had never heard of 50% of the people that are quoted in this book. I was expecting more exciting and funny quotes from famous people from all areas. What happened to great quotes from presidents, rock stars, movie stars, and scientists? There are so many people who said great things that are left out of this book. There has to be a better book of quotes out there!"
4,Pratical valutation,"A great atlas, with beautiful images, it lacks a description of ultrasound characteristis of anatomical structures (for example size and echogenicity of the ligaments)."
2,Unsafe ingredients,"I don't understand what the fuss is about over this soap. This soap contains ""Rosin"" which is unsafe for use in cosmetics. It is a known human immune system toxicant as well as a possible mutagen and carcinogen (i.e. linked to cause cancer). Pears also contains ""parfum"" which is a skin irritant/allergen and there are millions of types of scents that can be simply labelled ""parfum"" without telling us what is exactly in it. [...]"
1,Changed Formula,"Pears soap's formula has changed as of 2009. It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool."
1,Utterly disgusting version of a well-loved favourite,"I hadn't realised that Pears had changed the formulation of its transparent soap until I bought this. Dear God, what were they thinking of? It now smells of insect repellent and makes my skin itch and flake. I wouldn't even use this on the dog. Shame on you, Unilever!"
1,Not the Pears We Used to Love,The new Pears soap is an absolute disaster. It stinks and irritates my skin! I will never buy it again unless I am absolutely assured that it has been reformulated to its original quality. Too bad -- I've used it for over fifty years. It's all Dr. Bronners for me now!
1,Poor substitute,"This is a poor substitute of the original product, changed since 2009.The fragrance is insecticide, the after wash feels sticky.This is a very unfortunate turn of events."
2,Not the Original,"I have used Pears soap for years and years. I started using it when my daughter was small and it was the only soap that didn't irritate her skin. And I loved the herbal scent. I had a big carton of it that I finally used up and just recently ordered more. Come to find out, they changed the formula and it's all chemically now. No more herbal scent. And the bar is flatter. It hardly seems like the same soap. I have to look at the picture on the box to remind myself that it's Pears Soap . . . or is it?"
1,formula change,"The new formula has a different smell, texture, colour, shape, and size compared to regular pears soap. I prefer closer to the normal formula."
1,Bad Smell and Quality,I can't stand the smell of this new redone soap. It smells terrible!!! It took me only a second to throw it into a trash. Awful! Where can I buy the old formula?
1,Yuck!,This soap smells like tar - had to throw it out. Would not recommend this product to anybody. Had better luck with the glycerin soap at Whole Foods.
2,Turtles Concept Failed,"I assume this album was originally meant as some kind of parody of the ""Battle of the Bands"" concept. Maybe an excuse for covering different styles that would not be logical to touch on an ordinary album-concept.The idea may be good enough on its own; the big problem here is that very few of these songs are good enough to stand alone, which make them pretty uninteresting here 35 years later.Fortunately there are a few exceptoins. I somehow always found ""Chief Kamanawanalea"" pretty funny. And of course the McGuinn/Clark cover ""You Showed Me"" which has almost become a pop-classic.""Elenore"" is a good pop song, nothing more. The same can be said about the bonus tracks ""She`s My Girl"", another hit-single from this period, and ""Sound Asleep""Except for the mono versions of ""Elenore"" and ""You Showed Me"" the rest of the bonus tracks are pretty poor.I would recommend a Tutles best of compilation instead of this tiresome original."
2,stinker,This cd just isn't like the others. It did not fit my tast and I think I wasted my money on it. It is the worst of the turtles.
4,Great Light,"This light is easy to install, attractive looking and gives off a good amount of light. It was a great replacement for the plastic cheap fixtures in our living room."
3,seasons of paige?,"this is a good book but it focuses mainly on paige not the other sisters, espiecally in piper's story. as a big charmed fan i noticed that in the early paige books they tended to focus on paige there but i thought that was just so that they could establish her character after the lost of prue. but now it seems that she a bigger focus in all the books even though she's now been in more books than the character prue. i think the writers should share out the characters roles more evenly.this is a good book though in the fact that in infuses a bit of every day practiced wicca into it when it focuses on certain rituals preformed at certain times of the years.overall it's a good book but not if you've had enough of paige"
4,seasons of the witch vol.1 charmed,this book really is cool. There are three stories in this book one story for each Halliwel sister. The stories isnt long but all the stories ore episodes together is as long as one ordenery charmed pocket book.I enjoyed this book so much couse i could pick out one story that i liked best and read it in a couple of hours.Phoebes story is about that her body is been taken over by another person who wants to free a demon from a love spell.Piper story is about that she is afreid that her baby (not yet born) whould have problems beeing half witch half whitelighter since paige is orbing around town uncontrolled.paige story is about she tired of all deamon ass kicking and goes on a party that is more demonic than she thought...great book
5,I'm so glad you had this charger,I'm so glad you had this charger! My cell phone is very old and I lost the charger. I went directly to Amazon and found the one I needed. I was using it in less than a week! Thank You!
5,Cheap charger,"I got this after I destroyed my charger with a vacuum cleaner. It's $0.50, it does its job. Great. (Unfortunately, shipping was about $5.... :)"
3,Great!,"I did a play about this book and I was the narrator. I was telling the story. After doing the play, I learned so much then I did then reading the book. The reason I am rating this book 3 stars is because the play only made sense- not the book. I wouldn't say don't read it, but I would not say definitely read it."
1,This is NOT a good book for teaching about Pueblo people,"With dismay, I read the customer reviews of this book. There are 19 Pueblos in New Mexico, and more in Arizona. Which Pueblo is this book about? There is great variation from one to the other. Most troubling, however, is McDermott's presentation of the kiva. Our kivas are not places of trial. They are more akin to churches and temples where cultural knowledge is passed on from one generation to the next. Finally, extended families are central to Pueblo culture, and there is no stain of illegitimacy conferred on those who don't know who their father is. This book should NOT be used to teach about Pueblo Indians. These errors are major ones."
3,"good look, could be made a little better.","Ordered this for my 3 year old. She loved the look, however the sleeves were a bit tight and ""itchy"".The sleeves are made of sheer material with bands of elastic at the bicep and wrist.I cut the elastic on the arms to and had her ware a long sleeve t-shirt under the costume."
3,There's better,"My family liked the ""U"" shape / fit of a different brand better. This one works alright."
1,the name is decieving!,"I origanly thought that this book was part of Stphen Kings Dark Tower series that delt with Roland the last Gunslinger, which by the way is my absolute favorite series of books which I think everyone should read! Anyway, this book just sucks, the plot is horrible, and as I said the name is deciving. JUST A WARNING, you could have saved a little starving ethiopian for pennies a day, than buy this garbage they call a book!"
3,"Eh, It's ok - but there are many better books today","For its day it may have been great. But this is not its day, its 40 years later. There are many MUCH better books on Deduction and drawing inferences.How to Read Your Opponents Cards - Mike LawrenceCountdown to Winning Bridge - Tim Bourke / Mac SmithDormer on Deduction - Al DormerFrank Stweart has Winning defense for teh Advancing Player and Better Bridge for the Advancing player.Kelsey, Jannersten, Marshal Miles, and Kambites also have good books.(I do not recommend Pottages Clues from the Bidding)"
1,Horrible Picture,"I reccommend that you do not buy this product. When you use it for TV reception, to watch VCR tapes, or to play games with a console system the picture is terrible. You would be better off buying a television for the same price as it would look much better. When I tried to watch any shows the poor picture and color quality along with the distortions on the screen gave me a terrible headache. I returned this product the same day I recieved it as it was a waste of money."
4,Decent Overview,"This book is a fairly light read (for Economics) and a good overview of the Economic history of the U.S. It engagingly tells how our economy developed as the nation grew. This is not for people who have graduate degrees in Economics, but it is a good book for those wanting to learn about our nations economic history. Well written and in an entertaining style."
5,Awesome business history,Not too many books describe business history. This book takes you from the steam engine to todays technologies.If you like business and history this is a 10 star book.
1,Pure Economic Ignorance,"I first heard Mr. Gordon on 20/20 talking about the 1987 mini-crash of the stock market, and when he said, ""The Fed did the right thing then, it injected huge amounts of liquidity into the market."" If people believe creating money out of thin air and giving it to the politically connected helps the economy, they really need to go back to Econ 101. Oh wait, Econ 101 these days says exactly that in almost every government run school in America. For a much more detailed and insightful look at the History of Banking and the true cause of the booms and busts (hint: The Federal Reserve itself), read Murray Rothbard's ""A History of Money and Banking in the United States,"" or his ""The Mystery of Banking."" There you will find sound logic, as opposed to this trash."
2,One must mind their language....,"This is review is EXTREMELY partial, as the third sentence of Gordon's AN EMPIRE OF WEALTH was so thoughtless, tasteless, and incorrect, that it took alot of patience for me to pick it back up and read it for a class assignmet. Had I not been required to write about this particular book, I would left it where I had flung it after reading Gordon's thougtless, tasteless, and incorrect statemant that Abraham Lincoln's reputed formula for gaining knowledge of a nation's character by learning of its land, laws, and people is made difficult by it utter lack of ancient history. I have never before seen such a bad foot put forward so quickly in the writing of an authour whom I usually find to be more tolerable."
4,An Empire of Wealth,"As a student of both history and economics, I find the analysis and writing to be simplistic and dry, at times. It appeared to me that this book is writen at a very basic level, without fundamental analysis. Although I consider myself a libertarian I found Howard Zinn's liberal account of American History and progress (although not a text based on economics)to be much more engaging and enjoyable."
2,You might be a conservative if ...,"... you feel that Gordon's portrayal of U.S economic history, especially since the end of the 19th century onward, is compelling. Let me just say this -- Arthur Laffer, of the Laffer curve fame, receives a brief mention in this book given all that the author could have written about. Need I say more? If you're of the right-wing persuausion, you'll like this book. Otherwise, I'd pass."
1,don't waste your time or money!,"the author is another apologist for central banking, regurgitating the pablum he was fed undigested. his book is nothing more than one inconsistency after another - he seems to be completely unaware of what he is saying.written before the most recent economic debacle, he would most likely blame it on thomas jefferson or andrew jackson, maybe even the lack of a saving hero such as j.p. morgan (one of his heroes). he certainly would never blame it on fractional reserve central banking.don't waste your time or money. buy a book that tells the factual story - try""the history of money and banking in the united states"" by murray rothbard.i would have given a 0 rating had that been available."
5,One of the best U.S. Economic History books,I'm impressed with the stuff that John Steele Gordon dug up in his research. There are so many little tidbits that really add spice to his narrative. This is one of the best economic history books that I've read.
4,Lesson on Kangaroos,"I used this book as the starting point and interest building for a Lesson on Kangaroos. I first read the book to the CTT 4th grade class then we watched excerpts from PBS film ""The Beg Red Roos"" The students discussed what they learned and then wrote their own Roo Poem which some shared. Then at the end of the day we learned the song. The students LOVED it."
5,Great Book and CD!,This is really a great book. Artwork and story are great. CD sung by Mr. Lithgow is really fun. My daughter really loved this book and I loved reading it to her.
5,There's something funny going on here,"I don't know what it is about this book and cd, but my 2 and a half year old daughter picked up the words very quickly. Although the text is complicated and the words long, she remembers them and sings the entire song. When the cd is playing she turns the pages to the music. She loves either/both the book and cd. This is so much better than reading Barney and Disney I wish there was a whole series!"
4,A quality and rare movie for Mt. Rainier,We loved the video. It's short a little older but entertaining enough. We've purchased one for each of our Mt. Rainier cabins.
1,"If you have a problem, good luck, because you won't get help","I actually have an earlier model Samsung DVD player, and it, along with other Samsung models at the time, had a horrible skipping problem on many DVDs. Samsung's support was almost non-existant -- I found out there was a firmware upgrade for the player, but not through their website (where I couldn't find any help whatsoever), but through a friend with the same problem. HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt). Considering their lackluster customer support, I would advise anyone against buying any DVD player from this company. Players are much cheaper nowadays anyway, and you can get an excellent Sony or Toshiba for a modest price."
2,Studious detective fiction take on Rambo,"When books written by women get unreal, things like otherwise rotten characters having a change of heart and becoming angels happen; when males go outside of reality, you get books infused with the aggressive delusion that each character is an effigy instead of a metaphor. In this one, a guy is wronged and must get revenge. Many aspects of its understanding of crime are accurate and even more, highly artistically persuasive and insightful. However, as a whole the book seems (much as happens in Robert Parker books) like a cartoon that keeps trying to re-enter a dark alleyway although all of its characters are drawn in primary colors. This is a good book for airplanes or waiting in lobbies for job interviews."
4,Good Price for good product,"This is a great battery for the price. The quality is there, and that is everything. I alternate between this and my original equipment battery. I also am satisfied enough with the talk and standby time to choose this over the Extended battery..."
3,Convenience.,"It's the same size as any other charger.It works everywhere. (Seriously, plug it into the carpet and it works.)But the cable that connects to the DS is short.Everyone's a critic."
4,Best bang for your buck,"My son lost his charger,this was a good replacement.The only thing is it only goes out to about 4 feet, not the 6 feet it claims.Other than that it's a good product."
4,not what I was expecting,"It's absolutely my fault for not reading the details. I thought I was buying NATURAL coral, as in REAL. This is a synthetic coral and it would be great for decoration in an aquarium. it looks really nice but I was looking for the real deal to use in an art experiment, and as the coral would be placed in a kiln and bunt off I don't think this plastic/resin piece would work very well (or be very health friendly). I also didn't understand why, since its plastic, the package was shipped in another package and bubble wrapped like it was a fragile piece of glass."
3,nice,it's not as big as I had hoped but it's nice. it's best feature other than being white is that it's made from resin. Coral belongs in the ocean.. lets keep it there. Yay for resin.
4,Nice but deceptively packaged,"Sinatra produced a number of high quality studio Christmas cuts over the years, but these tracks - courtesy of the non-official Laserlight label - apparently come from the Bing Crosby/Frank Sinatra Christmas TV special, even if that's not clear from the packaging and non-existent liner notes, which omit recording details. Buyers could, understandably, think this is a collection of officially released songs, even though it's not on Columbia, Capitol, or Reprise - or licensed therefrom. The sonic quality is consistent with that - it is not a polished studio release. Still, these songs do reflect nice performances from a fine period, and a duet with Bing Crosby is a bonus. But this is hardly the first place someone looking for Sinatra's Christmas music should start."
5,An excellent and important work!,"There's probably not too much to add to the reviews already up. This is a great book that everyone should read. If you like reading works that actually have something to say, this is the book for you. Intelligent and inspired, Lofton's latest piece is sure to please."
2,"fierce people, not so fierce movie","This is an uneven film. The first half is pleasant enough, but the plot develops so slowly as to go virtually nowhere. Then the movie takes a sudden dark turn, and though it held my attention from here out, it seemed too different, almost like watching a separate movie. The film has some fine moments of insights and sentiments, and it also contains moments that feel contrived and forced. High caliber actors did their usual fine job, but most of the characters are presented superficially. The attempt to draw parallels to an indigenous South American tribe with the assembled characters is marginal at best. This is a mixed movie for me; two and a half stars right down the middle, but not a twinkle more; they could have and should have done a better job."
2,This movie left me feeling dirty (and not in the good way),"Basically, this movie depicts rich people as incredibly selfish and horrible human beings. The movie parallels the society of the priveledged to an indigenous tribe (I forget the parallel)... maybe survival of the fittest or something of that nature. There's drugs, sex (with adults and teenagers), murder, self-mutilation and sodomy of a teenage boy,.... need I say more. This was a story of a summer vacation gone horribly wrong....why did the family stay? As soon as this movie was over (I watched the entire film for some reason), I popped in a feel good movie: ""P.S I Love You"" (which was a much better movie, BTW)"
2,Mixed up movie-hard to follow,Although this movie has some great actors (Sutherland and Diane Lane) it was hard to follow and at times did not make sense. It was hard to sit thru and times due to it being slow and I had to advance chapters a few times to try and figure out what is going on. My advice is --rent it but do not buy it. I do not see this as a B movie but not anything more than a C movie. Disappointing dispite the cast.
2,Yawn,"There was much potential with this cast. Chris Evans was biggest disappointment, and only reason I bought the DVD. He should only act with his shirt off, as he did in CELLULAR, wherein his initial shirtlessness and the appearance of Jason Statham carried the rest of the movie.Not so in FIERCE PEOPLE. Story meanders and gets lost after pivotal event mid-screenplay. Ending sucks."
4,Good movie,"I bought this movie because Kristen Stewart was in it and I wasn't disappointed. She did a good job. The story seemed to drone on but overall I liked it, and wouldn't be afraid to tell someone else to view it."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The description for this movie was very far off. It is boring, hard to follow, and the story line is not all that good. The acting is just okay. I was dissapointed..."
4,"Fierce People (not to mention evil, mean and sick)","This film surprised me. This film shocked me. This film made me mad and sad and angry! I own this movie and have watched it a number of times with different friends. The reaction is always intense, one way or the other."
3,Stand Out & Second Chances,"Every now and then, I come across a movie that I must watch at least twice before I can determine where I stand with it. This is one of those films.I will be honest with you...I didn't think I liked it at first. The movie in its entirety isn't exactly my cup of tea. But for me, it's really about the moments and relationships within the story that make it or break it.I do pay attention to detail, but in order for me to really feel the personality of a film, I rediscover it a few times. Upon viewing it a second time, I grew quite fond of Kristen Stewart's character. There is a realness and attractiveness about her that I find intriguing.Although I may not be too engrossed in the overall story of the film, I find myself still watching in hopes of seeing her again. I might go so far as to say that if it weren't for her character and her impact on the film, I would not be interested in this movie."
5,Wow,"This movie is outstanding! It's intense, and terrible things happen, but the story and the actors are all amazing. I've been wanting to see Anton Yelchin in something else ever since seeing him in ""Taken"", and I was really impressed by his role in this film. I also wanted to see Kristen Stewart in something else, and I watched this one and another one she was in, and I'm extremely impressed with her. I expected another Bella, but in both movies, she was totally different. I don't know what it is, how some actors can be so many different characters so convincingly. some are basically the same all the time, but not these two extremely fine actors! Everyone in this movie played their roles to perfection, and I highly recommend it."
3,What's with this marketer?,"I have purchased a lot of the South Park sets; I love the show and love having them at my beck and call. However, most of the disks have the ego driven creators with an intro you can't skip over. Also, I have had more DVD problems with their disks than those from any other vendor. Some of the sets were just plain unusable; this set had some disks that would freeze up. Frustrating..."
5,Best Season of DVD Yet,"All the seasons of South Park on DVD have been improvements over the previous, and this set is no different. Matt and Trey continue their pot shots at everything from hate crimes to Elian Gonzalez to boy bands to child molestation. And they do it in a very creative, very funny way. And it's awesome. Nuff said."
1,Beware of this title and two others that are IDENTICAL!,"""The Masters"", ""Lovin' Up A Storm"" and ""No Introduction Necessary"" are ALL THE SAME ALBUM! Stupid me. I bought all three. This practice of retitling albums that have the same content borders on a SCAM. The record companies are catching h___ from the Feds. Perhaps they deserve everything they're getting.The music is fair, but it must pre-date Led Zeppelin by a couple of decades. It doesn't sound even remotely like the Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones we know from Zep or post-Zep."
2,Definitly not Zeppelin,"As the album says in its liner, this was a singer trying to break his way into the recording business with the help of a couple friends. His friends happened to be JPJ and Jimmy Page. This is a technique that labels used in the sixties to get new artists on the charts: billing the stars who helps on the album, but who aren't the featured performers. Overall I really didn't like the music, but I don't really like 50's rock-a-billy to begin with. If you enjoy it, then by all means go for it."
3,Auto Radio Antenna,"The antenna looks good and works very well, however the threaded stud that attaches the antenna to the sheet metal is too short.The threaded stud is long enough if the antenna is mounted on a completly flat surface. There are hardly any flat surfaces on a modern dayautomobile. I had to discard the grommett and use a silicon sealer to make it work.This is fault of engineer at factory. The threaded stud needs to be at least 1/8 inch longer - 1/4 inch would be better. The antenna appears to be well made, but time will tell."
3,its cute to look at,cute to look at but the pocket is not that functional. the bib is very big & stiff and my baby does not like it! wish he did the food misses the flattened pocket every time. Maybe if you fold or bend it outward it might catch a cracker.
2,Not very opaque,I wanted to put it on a blue shirt I had and instead of making it yellow it turned the shirt green. maybe it would work better for a white shirt but it definitely doesn't work for colored shirts.
3,Mediocre,"This ball is very cheaply made, even for an outdoor ball. You're paying for the Never Flat effect and name. Do not purchase this unless you've felt it (the Outdoor version, not the Indoor/Outdoor version) in person first."
5,Great Price-Value!,NEVER FLAT!Have it since six months - it's still like on the first day.The ball has a great grip also!
3,never flat?,I purchased this basketball for my son because I understood it would not go flat during cold weather or anything. I hate to tell you but it has already lost a lot of air and will have to be aired up to use it again. I was disappointed when my son told me this. There were a lot of other basketballs I contemplated buying but reading about Never Flat caught my attention and I decided to get it as well as a football. Not so sure it was a good choice.
4,Better after the (1) year???,"I actually like this ball so much better after the (1) year was done when I actually took out just a little bit of air? Didn't really call out to me before but now, I'm balling with it so much more. Great grip even outdoors."
2,Went Flat in 10 Weeks,This is the second Never Flat basketball that I bought -- only to have it go flat in less than 3 months of casual play in the driveway.
1,Spalding Never Flat Outdoor,"The rubbery feel to this basketball was unexpected. I was expecting the ball to have a leather feel similar to that of the TF-1000. However, it feels like a cheap rubber basketball. Very disappointed with the product."
3,not what it looks like,"This ball is not what you think it is, it is rubber like a kids ball however if you want a non composite ball it is perfect"
1,Never flat ball was flat when received,"The never flat ball was flat when received. We live overseas and the ball was shipped via air. I'm not sure if that caused the ball to go flat. We had ordered two basketballs at the same time. While the regular Spaulding Street Basketball arrived just fine, the Never Flat Basketball was flat. Ironical."
1,doesnt bounce,Pros: Very grippyCons:- Doesnt bounce at all. You have to over inflate it to get it to bounce like a normal ball. but then it feels like a rock.- Has a real cheap/tinny pinging sound when you bounce the ball. rather than a nice deep bounce sound.i dont understand the 4 star rating for this ball. it is a virtually unusable ball for any type of serious or even casual player.P.s yes u can re-inflate the ball. it just a bit hard to take off the cover for the pin.I hated this ball so much i had to return it. feel sorry for the sorry sod who ended up buying it. lol
1,Flat in a few days,"I had purchased these balls for my dog to play with, and since we have had success with the ""Never Flat"" subset of spalding they seemed like a fantastic deal. We can usually get 2 months out of a standard basket ball and 8 months out of a never flat. This basketball lasted 4 days. It was very disappointing and I think I will send back the second one we bought."
3,It's a basketball,"This is a Christmas present for my son. It arrived on time and nicely packaged. We will have to wait and see if it is really ""never flat."""
2,"Yeah, in a vacuum it won't go flat:(",We have a half-court in the back. B-Balls get tested. For longevity and ability to hold air this is about in the middle of the indoor/outdoor pack. We keep about 6 at any given time. The marketing for this ball is great. The product did not live up however.
2,NEVER FLAT IS FLAT,"The first one I received became flat after a couple of days. I thought it was a defect and called Amazon for a replacement. Sadly, the second one must have been it's twin because it went flat after a couple of days as well. Either this is a manufacturing defect or the ball has been sitting in Amazon's warehouse since the Civil War and lost air when I took delivery.The sounds isn't as bad as some reviewers have complained. Sure it's not quite the normal thunk but a little more hollow and echo sound. You're not going to go deaf and it certainly isn't going to improve your FG percentage. The advantage I think with the Never Flat is that the outer material seems very durable. Only time will tell."
2,Basket ball,It is not as good as advertise of this product. I will never buy this product again. I am very disappointed
2,"never flat, more like always flat","i have had this same issue, i ordered the ball from Amazon, when i received it, it was slightly deflated, i then pumped it to it's recommended 7-9 PSI using a pump and guage, next day, was semi low, pumped again to 8.7, then left it over the weekend and now i come and it is about 4PSI and deflated almost!maybe being at 30k feet flying down to another country made it flat, but this is ridiculous, never flat, more like always flat, VERY disappointed, going to talk to amazon about a refund for this product and if i can ship it back with out it costing me a fortune."
3,Knicks_Hash,Basketball was exactly what i wanted except for being rubber. I definitely was looking for a leather basketball. So u had to return.
4,"good ball, recommended pressure is not great","It's a good ball. I thought it was under pressure when I got it, but I checked it - and the pressure was 8 pounds, which was the recommended pressure written on the ball. I inflated it to 11 pounds, which feels about right.Overall, a good ball.There are some people who have commented that you can't inflate the ball. That is not true. The hole where you stick in the needle is covered. I used my fingernail lift up the the small black covering and then I used needle nose pliers to pull up the black covering. Then I inflated the ball and pushed the small black cover back over the hole."
3,SPALDING never flat is alright :(,"Ok, i order this ball online assuming that it would be and feel as good as a regular basketball but not get flat ,well sad to say i was deceived because it bounces super high and it feels way different than a normal good quality spalding basketball . you are better off going to Hibbits and buying the SPALDING BASKETBALL there ,it will cost you about $50 dollars but its well worth it if you want to feel true QUALITY in a ball."
1,Went flat...,The ball went flat within two days after it was opened as a gift on Christmas day.Therefore the description 'Never Flat' does not appear to be accurate.
2,"Had potential, but kind of blew it.","I guess this could have been worse. I mean, they probably didn't put much into it and I have seen bigger pieces of crap that obviously spent more money to be nothing. It isn't really confused about what it is. Kind of a waste of time but had some potential. Just kind of gets lost in a BS college love story and shallow characters (including a poor-man's jack black ripoff)"
3,Pretty good,"I liked this zombie flick. Good storyline and pretty good zombies. The beginning is the College game of Human versus Zombies, but then it actually became it's title. Pretty cool"
1,Waste Of Time And $$$,Stay away... Seriously... Stay as far away from this film as you can. Aweful does not do this film justice. An arm full of heroin could not convince me to watch it again. Perhaps when I am dead...
3,Not complete trash.,"It's a low budget horror film. Since it is a low budget film, the acting, effects, and a storyline wont be amazing, nor should the viewer expect it to be. For a low budget film, it does a pretty good job. The storyline was different, and added a few interesting additions to what is otherwise your standard Zombie film. There is quite a bit of irony and the characters don't exactly take on the roles as stereotypically in other films.i don't want to give a spoiler on any part of the film, so I'll leave it at this,... I have stopped watching movies before, sometimes as early as 5 minutes, but i made it to the end of this movie and was not completely dissapointed. It gets three stars because it is exactly that, which is the sum of ""Nothing to rave over"" + ""Nothing to complain about"" + 3 stars."
4,Um,"A fun, but strange low budget zombie film, that is based on a game played at colleges it says. I haven't heard of it at all."
3,ZZZombies,This is a snoozer. Another B zombie movie to add to my rapidly growing B collection. You can't believe everything you read. I use these reviews to help me select movies & as we all know these are personality driven.
1,Too Scary,"I agree with the other reviews that this movie is too scary. It is not in keeping with the other Pooh movies. I had not read any reviews before buying it and was very surprised at how dark and scary it was. I had to turn it off and won't let my daughter see it again. If you are looking for something Pooh bear, happy and educational, go with the new My Friends Tigger and Pooh DVD. It came out at the beginning of March 08 and has 3 episodes (2 stories each). You can see them on TV but having them on DVD frees up your DVR and lets you take the super sleuths in the car or your portable DVD player."
1,review,"i am writing this at amazon's request. any parents who enjoy having their children watch depressing material, will get great satisfaction from this dvd. as a child, i enjoyed the pooh books and disney cartoon version immensely. as a new parent, i find the new tigger and pooh series (playhouse disney) equally fun. what happened in between, i'm unsure. i took a chance on this, and 3 other ""hundred acre wood"" movies. to try and fill in the gap as to how they moved on to todays current playhouse series, from the original 1968 disney world presentation. what a disappointment. the entire program focused on either sense of personal loss, or personal phobia's and insecurities. the sad music and songs played throughout reflect this depressing tone. i think of pooh (or tigger) and i get happy, not bummed out. this was clearly a mistake installment and should be ommitted... not just from your collection, but from even renting/watching."
2,pooh's grand adventure,"wih the ""success"" of the aladdin sequels Disney took another movie and made a sequel this time with Winnie-the-pooh while disney tries to to keep the magic of pooh but it still falls short. the story is predictable and the music is bland and unmemarble not to mention Kanga and Roo are missing.yet another disney dud."
1,zero stars (not 1 star) - don't buy it (sorry amazon),"We have Piglets Big Movie which is an absolute favorite of my 2 year old. So being the sweet mother I am, I bought her this movie. It petrified her. It required constant narrative on my part to explain away the disturbing scenes - which predominate the film. It is dark and scarey, and slow, and depressing. The ending might be great but we only got through a half an hour of the movie - waiting for the tone to change. It didn't.The movie will be put away for years to come if I don't sell it at a yard sale first (which I likely will do - because I couldn't stand to watch it either)."
2,"Frankly,a bit dull","When Pooh misreads a note saying Christopher Robin has gone to school,he sets off to rescue his friend. The plot is predictable, and frankly, a bit dull. Many reviewers have said the movie scared their small children,and I can almost see why. While Pooh is exploring a cave,we hear ''spooky'' echoes and mysterious growling in the distance. Pooh falls from a tall height and into a murky swamp. And yet,during all this,the film has a cartoonish tone so none of this events are truly disturbing,however scary they may seem. It feels no soul has gone into the songs, they are bland,cheesy and forgettable,as is the story.RATING:4/10"
1,"Should be called ""Pooh's Scary Adventure""","Beware of this movie if you're young child is sensitive or easily frightened. We rented this great-sounding movie to watch with our 4-yo daughter as she has wanted to watch a Pooh movie. While this movie starts out wonderfully with a great scene and song about friendship between Christopher Robin and Pooh, the bulk of the movie is spent with Pooh and friends looking for Christopher Robin. During this time, the 100-acre wood is made to seem like an extremely dark and scary place, which we were not expecting, and the tone seems to get progressively more gloomy. We told my daughter that it would get better, but it got to the point where a despondant Pooh sings a sad song and my daughter just started bawling, and asked ""When are they going to get out of there???"". The ""good parts"" of this movie at the beginning and end don't begin to balance the long sad part through the majority of the rest."
5,The Best Pooh movie by far!,"This movie is excellent. Fans of the classic Pooh cartoons (""Blustery Day,"" ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""A Day for Eeyore"" and the like), and of ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" will love it. Wonderful songs embellish this perfectly created Pooh story. Some complain that it is dark, scary, and such. Certain parts are, but definitely not overly so. It's necessary to the plot and the message of the film; not every second is 'terrifying' and even for young children, no scene should be too 'scary.' The sad emotional quality of this movie sets it apart a little bit too, but again, it is not too sad for kids, nor is it much more 'depressing' than many other Pooh tales. There is a happy ending with a fun song just as should be expected. From beginning to end 'Pooh's Grand Adventure' is truly grand and should not be missed; the only possible problem I can see is the disclusion of Gopher!"
1,the most pathetic attempt of a book ever,complete trash. i didnt realize rednecks could write. its okay though. maybe fox news will do a special on it
4,"Great for health, and other things too!","I bought this as a gift for my partner who has a medical fetish. She loves it! We get to learn more about human anatomy, and have a good time doing so.As far as the product, it seems to be good quality for it's price. The 'beak' is a bit crooked, but it doesn't hinder anything, though it was scary at first. For those curious, it widens two ways, of course the 'beak' spreads, and the diameter can be widened.For those getting this for sexual wellness and not sexual fun, this product can be paired with a good old hand mirror and a flashlight. It's a bit tricky to get it in by yourself, but it's definitely doable."
1,Defective Product.,"This product is a fine product, unless you actually want to use it. The top thumb nut is capable of sliding up and down the bolt making it impossible to use as intended. I will not make the purchase again."
1,No Good,"Its junk! , its made so cheap, the metal is to thin,I would rather paid more money and got something of a better quality.With the cost of the shipping I really feel it was a Bad........Buy."
3,Item,It was okay. It was a built a bit flimsy and was hard to work. My spouse found it not amusing and well it was just OK.
4,"Works great, good quality for the price","This product is exactly as pictured and promised. Strength and durability is nice, great value for the price, would have given it five stars instead of four except for the fact that it is a little difficult to operate with one hand when using by yourself."
4,Mixup but not bad at all,"Well I ordered this baby V and it arrived promptly and with decent packaging. The funny thing is that what arrived wasn't a baby V but a baby Z. I tried it out and found that it worked just fine with great tone and the person I was getting it for loves it so I figure it's win/win.I'm sure such mixups aren't frequent(never happened to me before or after) and their entire product line is pretty good especially with a rockin effects pedal, I plan to get an actual V from them sometime in the future because quality is quality."
3,Disappointed,"If you are looking for a trash bin with a granite top Do Not Buy this one.Product features say ""Built-in cutting board with 12""x12"" granite inset"" but it is actually only a hardwood top. If the product feature had not included this, would not have bought it. Would have gone to another website where they did have one with the granite inset and for just $10 more. Tried to save some money but didn't work. Too much money to send back otherwise I would."
1,This is a disapointing book...........,"My biggest problem with this book is that the title suggests material that is only covered in the last 10% of the book. I purchased it to get a lay person's view of string theory but the book hardly refers to string theory at all. It covers a lot of material in the first 90% that I was already familiar with and did not need another book to explain it all to me again. I was expecting a book that concentrated on events over more recent years, and not another book going right back to the beginning of quantum theory. In my opinion, the title misrepresents the content."
4,Well written and informative,"If you are looking for more than "" Oh, Golly"" physics with some real mathematics, then this will be disappointing, but if you like Richard Feynman type informative lectures that name the names and give an understandable overview, then this is a well written book with history and facts and references. I got is as a gift from a friend who was trying to be of help! It was more help than some of my Google searches on the Internet!"
5,"A clear nonmathematical treatment of quantum theory, and TOE","Popular books on quantum theory are like cheap toilet paper, they fall apart easily. Gribbin's latest book is a triumph for the quantum wanabees who think they know some of the basic concepts, but in reality can only recite what they've read. Gribbin has a way of giving the reader an insight into what can only be properly understood mathematically. This book was written for those who don't know the math, but wish they did. The only thing ""cheap"" about this book is the price. Excellent!"
2,Very little information about strings,"This book was a disappointment, while there is some excellent background on the structure of matter and quantum mechanics, there is very little on the topic of superstrings. In reading through it, I got the impression that the segments on strings were an afterthought, something that needed to be mentioned but in no great detail.If you need some knowledge of quantum mechanics and the historical development of the understanding of matter, then this book is worth reading. However, if your interest is first and foremost that of the current theories of strings and superstrings, then quite frankly this book is not worth your time and money."
2,not his best,"This book is a little thin. And expensive for what little it offers. The first part is included in his better book on the Big Bang. The last two chapters are an update of that material. And it is mostly chatter. This book will give you some feeling for the new buzzwords, but no useful understanding. I hope this book does not damage Gribbins otherwise good reputation."
5,awesome movie!,"One of those movies that is sad, but very well-done, humorous in some parts, beautiful scenery of Spain, and interesting because it is based on a true story. It also made me interested to read the writings of the subject of this movie, Ramon Sampedro, which are collected in a book called ""Cartas del Infierno."" Incredible acting by Javier Bardem."
5,A Film for the Living / Una Película para los Vivos,"What a great film! Powerful, moving, funny, and human. I was able to get this DVD and totally regret not having been able to see it in the theater. I have seen the DVD a couple of times and have been emotionally moved each time. No matter where you stand on the reality of death, Ramón Sampedro tells those around him that life is a right and NOT an obligation. After you see this film, you will not be the same.¡Qué pena fue no haber visto esta película en el cine! Pienso que Mar Adentro es una de las mejores obras que he visto en mucho tiempo. Algo totalmente conmovedor que te pone al frente la realidad que es la muerte y cómo Sampedro obtuvo atención nacional e internacional queriendo realizar sus deseos. Esta película te dejará pensando por muchos días y nunca volveras a ser el mismo. ¡Excelente!"
1,don't buy if you plan on watching with subtitles,"The screenshot shudders everytime a new subtitles comes on screen, or every few seconds. Gave me a massive headache after about 10 minutes. No problems without subtitles. Poor production I suppose."
4,Mar Adentro,"Excellent movie, it shows the conflict between living as a burden to your family and having to choice not to as a paralyzed person."
4,what is death with dignity?,"I don't think this film adds anything new to the debate about so-called ""death with dignity"" or the right to end your own life. But it is a tender and nuanced treatment of the subject that raises the major questions and includes the major stakeholders--the legal system, a religious priest who is caricatured as moralistic and uncaring, friends, and a three-generation family that lives with and cares for the quadriplegic Ramon, who after a diving accident 26 years ago wants to end his life since, he insists, it is a life with no dignity. Ramon's brother adamantly objects: ""nobody kills anyone in my house."" Others are not so sure. Four women in particular loom large in the film's plot. I will not spoil Ramon's final choice, which to the film's credit is not clear until the very end. The Sea Inside is based upon a true story in Spain, and was voted Best Foreign Film for 2004. In Spanish with English subtitles."
2,Not for a Corolla,"If you were to use this for a Toyota Corolla, you'd be disappointed. Certainly not made for it. The wiring on the corolla is so very different when compared to this one. Probably works well with other cars."
1,carp,"worked only a few times.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!I bought from target, so I thought it was a real program that actually worked, but I was sorely wrong.Hear that sound? 30 bucks down the toilet."
4,Works as advertised - I love it,"I dont know what the other persons review is talking about but i have never had a problem with this software. I have ripped tons of DVDs in my collection to my PSP. There were a few times the audio and video dont quite sync up perfect but most of the time it does. Plus some of the movies i put on my PSP were Godzilla so the audio sync issue is a non-issue. The latest ones i have ripped have worked flawlessly. I love this software. As far as the sound and video quality...its not quite as good as a UMD movie. but you arent paying for the movie twice either, so cant complain. If you have a large DVD collection and want to rip them to your PSP i highly recommend this product. I love it."
4,Works great - Just as advertised.,This works just fine. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. But I've put about 6 movies into an 8gb Memory Stick. I still have room for a few more.
5,Who Is That Masked Man?,"Who is that masked man? That's what my granddaughter wanted to know after seeing me wearing the AO Safety Woodworker's Respirator. It has worked fine for me thus far. I experienced no fogging and no face or head discomfort. I agree with another reviewer who stated he didn't have the desire to take it off and burn it like some other masks. Well put! After using a few at home as well as in the USMC, I know exactly what he means. This one is lightweight and as comfortable as you're going to get wearing this type. I haven't had mine on for longer than 30 minutes in mild temperatures. I can't say it would never get annoying if worn for an extended period of time in hot weather because, frankly in my experience, they all do. Don't forget to order yourself extraAO Safety Replacement Filters. ~ The Boss"
4,Woodworker respirator,"The woodworker respirator works well, just as expected. It obviously filters out the dust; it does not fog glasses."
5,Good and easy,"I've used a North 5500 for quite a while due to comfort, price and effectivity. I find this AO product to be perfect for basic respirator needs. The filtering seems to be acceptable for general dust use. The due exhaust ports provide minimal resistance and the single strap self adjusts for a comfortable fit. I'll leave my other respirator for more demanding uses and keep this one handy for the majority of my needs. I recommend you give it a try. Stay safe and live long."
4,Worth it,"Bought this at a good price to use while cutting laminate flooring. Worked great for that. Also, Used it while grinding down some concrete. Again, worked great. Then used while mowing as it was very dry and dusty, with a lot of pollen."
4,Good product,"It works well and is as comfortable as a mask can be. I didn't give it 5 stars because I do get a little air coming in around my nose sometimes. I've tried adjusting it but it still happens. Who knows, maybe it is just my nose. ;-)"
5,My head is regular sized and my nose is big,"I wear it and almost forget its on, I read the reviews about fit, and had some concerns,(7-5/8"" hat) but have not had a problem, bought it 10/7/07 for hobby woodworking, and am still waiting to change the filter. (bought filters at time of purchase) I have the bigger model too, for painting, staining, its also great,(Safety-95090-Quicklatch) these 95090 Quicklatch filters, take the actual smell out of the air."
5,Best respirator/dust mask i and my co-workers have used!!!,"I have been using this Respirator for months and i love it, i work at a UPS Hub and it gets VERY dusty, especially when i am unloading parcels inside trailers, this Respirator has literally been a life saver to me and a few co workers i bought it for.One of my co workers had allergies so i got his this Respirator and he no longer has any allergies, awesome!I highly recommend this to anyone who's like me and works in a dusty environments, it's the best $14 you'll spend."
4,Perfectly reasonable product,A reasonable wood dust filter for the price. A little restrictive in moving air in and out but bareable. Fits over my big nose and seals well enough to avoid fogging my safety glasses. Which is my original peeve with paper filter masks - always fogging my safety glasses especially in either hot or cold weather. In the end a good dust collection system is the solution but this is a reasonable $15 fix.
4,Great for allergy sufferers,This is a great product. My husband uses it for yard work and it has helped with his allergies.
2,"cheaply made, small, not worth the price","the mask is fairly small, appears to be cheaply made especially the rubber strap - this strap will not stand the test of time. had i actually seen it in the hardware store i never would have bought, particularly at the near to $15 price. To me, the price/value would be more apt in the $8 range. It certainly does not look like the pic on amazon - the pic makes it appear larger than it is, the surface area of the filter hence will be limited in it's ability to handle larger volumnes of air over time- but then they want you to buy replacement filters faster."
3,Reduced air flow makes it uncomfortable.,"After reading all the reviews, I bought this mask.Thinking this must be the last mask I would want.But that is not the case.Good:- Fits comfortably on face,- Does not fog up your glasses.Bad.- The rubber bands pinched my ears.- I did gardening with it. and the air flowwas not enough when I wasbreathing heavily.Due to the filter the air flowis reduced. So after a while I was feelinguncomfortable, due to lack of air. You cannotput it on for longer times.You could also get it at OSH.I did not see any mask, which hada built in fan which will suck the airfrom outside, so that you do not havebreath hard to get the air in through thefilter."
3,"Good function, Bad size","Pro: This respirator seems to work very well. I've used quite a few of the more expensive respirators rated for dust & pollen, adn this one does at least as well as the others. It is very light-weight, and has only one filter to change, keeping the cost of replacement filter to a minimum.Con: I always wear a medium sized respirator, but this one is just too darn small! There's no mention of size, so I assume that it's supposed to be a 'one size fits all' kind of thing. However, that certainly is not the case. In order for it to comfortably fit the nose, the bottom of the cup is right on my lower lip. Or if I want it to fit my mouth comfortably, the top of the cup is pressing against the cartilige of my nose...very uncomfortable."
2,Disposeable mask,The main complaint I have about the mask is it's fit. Initially - it felt a little uncomfortable - but I got used to it where it didn't bother me to wear the mask.I was really excited to find an economical dust mask that I could replace filters and not spend too much money on the filters. I still have 2 packages of replacement filters that I'll probably never use - after replacing the filter once - the mask no longer seals around my face.I think they could fix the problem if they had a dual point attachment connecting the strap to the mask. But it attaches at one point like a pair of swimming goggles so there's not alot of flexibility to adjust the fit.My conclusion is you get what you pay for - and I'm currently looking for another alternative to replace this respirator. It worked well initially - when I could get a good seal around my face.Jake
4,good mask,"This mask works very well to cover my mouth and nose. It has a great seal. The only thing I wish.....and I know it takes a more expensive mask to do this......is that it was easier to breathe in and out with.EDIT: I have contacted AO Safety by email about replacing the baffels in the mask that have worn out, and they have not contacted me back. I have instead gone with a 3M mask."
2,Book is a photocopy,"I was quite disappointed, with the publisher not amazon, because the entire book is a photocopy. I wanted to keep this book in my library and something of this sort is just not acceptable. I even went to barnes and nobles to see if they had a good version of this book, but they sell a this photocopy for around $59. Sad isn't it!No issue with amazon. Never have had. Timely arrival, no damage etc. I am glad I paid a discounted price for this on amazon because paying around $60 for a photocopy is definitley not worth it."
5,A Practioner's Guide,"This book had the benefit of not only being educational, but a fun read (written, I'm sure, in a style similat to that in which Ms. Carbone speaks). Taking the perspective of a self-professed ""charred"" Architect, Ms. Carbone carefully takes you through a description of not only what Enterprise Architecture is, but what the deliverables should look like and, most valuably, how to develop them. If you're famailar with Zachman or the Zachman Framework, Ms. Carbone clearly explains where she ""overlaps"" with the Framework, and where she doesn't. The value added to this book is in its almost cook-book style approach (while indicating where a thoughtful chef might ""flavor to taste"" - my words). My only complaint is that an Amazon search on Enterprise Architecture doesn't identify this book (I had to find it through other searches)."
2,Not ALL NATURAL and Contains TALLOW,"Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it is not ALL vegetable based(contains animal Tallow)and also has preservatives(DMDM Hydantoin-which releases formaldehyde into product!!,Tetrasodium Etidronate among others)- yet, some are touting its ""all natural"". Luckily, I found WendyLou's Natural Milk Baths and Soaps. They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something without any chemicals."
5,Just what I needed.,"This is exacly what I expected and works flawlessly. I have no complaints on the quality or functionality. This made the wiring much easier than it would have been without it.Some people have stated that these items have the power lead and the negative lead switched, but the one I got did not. I double-checked mine before the install and everything was in the correct order.Also, I appreciate how the ends were ""pre-stripped."" Very helpful."
1,Burn Baby Burn: Don't Waste Your Time,"In hopes of one of the stories being good, I kept on reading each woman's story, and it never got better. No doubt this is the only book that I have been inspired to throw in my fireplace. The way she wrote these characters, it seems that Bushnell is a misogynist: 1) is a whore, 2) is a despiteful bitch 3) is crazy, 4) is boring and unoriginal. And most of the characters are so underdeveloped, like the Princess - supposedly she turned crazy and hooked on prescription drugs after her in-law offered her a Xanax. Pa-lease. If you are looking for a good read, don't buy this book."
3,Just the highlights,"I was excited to read this book as a huge fan of ""Sex and the City"", and I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but a random episode of ""Sex and the City"" proves to be more thought provoking. The four stories all seem to end abruptly as though even the author had no idea what to do with these troubled women. The first story starts the book off to a great beginning, but the second story is simply awful!!! It goes nowhere and the characters are despicable and it is written in an irritating fashion none of the other stories shares. The third story is my favorite; it does not apologize for its respective blonde or for her actions. A guilty pleasure. And the fourth is a cute, 30 minute read that I couldn't help wanting to be stretched out in length and replacing the second. A breezy read that will not have you thinking much afterwards."
2,Weak,"It seems to me the only reason this book was published was to tout the name of Candace Bushnell, who inspired the popular television series, Sex and the City. But if you read it (and Sex and the City) you will learn that the writing is no where near as good as the writing on the television show. The trampy characters in Four Blondes are boring and cliché and give the reader no reason to like them.Chick lit is fun when it's well written and the characters have some redeeming qualities. This is just a weak attempt to entertain by exposing four bimbos with a repulsive lifestyle.Sorry."
2,How Did I Ever Finish This Book,"I rarely put down a book once I have started it, and my reputation is intact with 4 Blondes, but how I ever got through it, I'll never know. The first segment, Nice N'Easy got me hooked, despite the trashy sex element (no, I'm not a prude, but this was a little over the top). The subsequent three segments went downhill, until I started skipping pages. Based on this reading experience, I will not be looking for Bushnell's next novel."
1,"Poorly written, boring and a waste of money!","I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so poorly written. I am a ""Sex and the City"" addict, and was very excited to read ""4 Blondes"". I can't tell you how disappointed I was to discover how truly awful this book was: Little or no story, horrible, under-developed characters, spelling mistakes, continuity errors (spelling the name of a town one way, then a different way, a few sentences down). I bought the hardcover, and boy, am I sorry!"
1,Truly terrible,"This is a book for stupid, vapid twenty-something females. There was no character development; there was simply a pile of drivel about how sad the lives of the rich, famous, powerful, beautiful et. al. are. A sad and silly novel. Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. Ms. Bushnell could not even properly spell the name of an infamous Hampton. (this is a detail she should certainly be able to master.) Just awful. Save yourself."
2,Not like Sex and the City,"While I enjoyed the television series SATC and have all seasons of DVDs, I thought I was looking for a great easy summer read. The back of the book and the reviews inside the front cover looked promising and interesting. This book consists of four stories, each one about a different blonde in NYC. This book really had nothing to do with living in NYC and I was very disappointed in the plot lines. The stories didn't go anywhere. The book seemed to go downhill from the first story about Janey. I am getting ready to start the fourth book, but I am afraid of how horrible it will be if the other three were so bad. Do not recommend reading this one!"
1,Gives blondes a bad name!!!!,"First off, I thought this book was one story, but in fact it is 4 different stories on 4 different blondes. I only made it through the first two. I thought this book was horrible. The stories didn't even finish in any kind of satisfying way (at least for me). Very disappointed!!!"
3,3 out of 4 not bad,"The first story was funny and held my interest, the second one I found to be hysterically funny (in a dark way), the last one was funny, but it was too short. The third story (Princess Cecilia) was way too long, lacked humor and had no plot. Get the book from the library, read the three good stories and you will have some fun, light reading."
4,Great for a mindless beach book,"In light of Summer coming up I would give this book four stars, though as literature three is probably a generous rating. Still if you enjoy ""Sex and the City"" you will probably get some serious guilty pleasure out of this one as ""light reading."""
1,Don't Bother,"I read this book only because I was a huge fan of ""Sex and the City"". What a disappointment - it's nowhere near as good as the series. What looks very good visually on screen (Fendi bags, designer shoes) just ends up being an exercise in name dropping in the book - and ends up being exceedingly boring by the end of it all. To top it off, the main characters come across as heartless and cold. Skip this one - there are much better things to spend your money on."
2,For Blondes?,"The first story was funny and enjoyable. The second - not bad, the third story is where I stopped reading and haven't picked up since.I think she is a good writer, she is smart with a lot of wit. But, I think this book probably doesn't show case her talent like Sex in the City (which I haven't read, but probably will at some point)."
1,Garbage!,"Garbage! Halfway through the book and bored to tears, I took it back to the store and demanded a refund. And guess what! I wasn't the first one to do so. Please don't waste your time and money on this book! It is nothing like SEX IN THE CITY!"
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun summer read. I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, but found this book to be overly pretentious and depressing. I kept reading thinking it might get better, but it never did. I don't know any women who will relate to the stories, much less enjoy them. Buy Sex and the City on DVD if you want fun stories that you can relate to, don't waste your money on 4 Blondes."
3,Mediocre,"I was expecting a bombshell of a book, no pun intended. It kept my attention, mainly because I wanted to see if it would improve. It did, somewhat. Still, I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I'd be with it. Good beach read, but that's about it."
5,Escape from reality,"I thought that Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes was absolutely wonderful! Being in a world of the rich and famous is a daydream for many of us, but Ms. Bushnell creates a wonderful escape into the ""elites"" world for four great chapters. She makes one think that having all the wealth and all the fame isn't what makes a person and that those who have it aren't always happy. I thought that it was a great follow-up to Sex and the City. They are both rauchily classy books!"
1,Terrible,This is the worst book I've read in years. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. I'm even more sorry that I picked it for my book club. No one in my book club will forgive me for picking it because we all hated it. The characters in the book are sad and twisted. Don't waste your time
1,Yuck. Don't waste your time.,"Don't make the same mistake I made and get sucked in by the Bushnell name. If you are looking to get your Sex In the City fix with this book, don't bother. The first character introduced was fun but I struggled to get through her story. As the book went on, I actually felt cheated by the lame-o storylines and going-nowhere plots. Thank God I got it from the library and didn't have to shell out $$ for this one.Just be patient and wait for the new season to start on HBO."
2,"Sorry, but this was awful!","Oh, my! This was one of the worst books I have read. It was shallow and smarmy! I finished the book, but really am not aware how that could have happened. There has to be some redeeming factor with the women in the book, but it is difficult to surmise from reading the book. I was very disappointed."
2,Are there really people like this??,"I feel like Bushnell is making fun of people she knows via characters in this book. There are two types of characters- the sex addicts or the people that think sex is horrible. Regardless, all of their lives revolve around sex, either loving it or hating it. I can't imagine a world where these people exist. It is depressing to read about people with such meaningless lives. Yet, it is insightful to see how people hit rock bottom, even if they are rich and beautiful or seem to have it all. A bit of a social commentary but I'm not sure if people in the ""fast lane"" do really live like this."
1,Disappointing,"Based on the success of Sex in the City but never having read the book, I was expecting more of Ms. Bushnell's writing. Her characters are extremely one-dimensional and not at all believable. Her writing style is simplistic and irritating. The stories seem more like gossip stories which have gotten out of hand, perhaps developed towards someone's object of derision. It was a big waste of my time and my money. I gained nothing from reading the book."
1,A big let down,"I was hoping this book would be as humors and enjoyable as Sex and the City. Instead I got four stories about characters that were so one dimentional as the book I was reading. Each story ending leaving me feeling I was stopped in the middle of an intersection. Their was no closeure on anyone of the characters. This book is being sold mainly on the authors reputation and is not worth the money. Stick to watching ""Sex and the City"" on HBO. It is much more enjoyable than wasting your time on a book where the characters have no personality or life of their own. This books leaves you feeling let down and suckered into buying a book where the anticipation ends on page one."
1,4 Blondes,I bought this book with every belief that it was going to be good (if not great) but I was sadly disappointed! These women need serious psychological help at the very least. The book goes absolutely no where with absolutely no plot. I hung in there and read it until the end but boy was I ever sorry I wasted my eyesite.
2,4 evil wenches,"Readable and witty, but it's virtually impossible to empathize with any of the characters. There are struggles in each story, but none of them ever get resolved. Another reviewer called it predictable, but I disagree. I didn't expect all of the stories to be depressing (which I blame the jacket for...it's misleading). In fairness, I've only read 3 so far. I'll change my review if the 4th is OK."
2,Blondes DON'T Have More Fun,"I was expecting 4 Blondes to be a fun read just like Sex in the City is fun to watch. Boy, was I wrong. The four blondes are self-obsessed, egotistical, and conceited. The four stories had nothing to do with each other (well, I haven't read the last 5 pages it's been so boring). It's written like 4 short stories that don't end, they just stop. My advice: if you must read it then borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money."
1,Four Awful Stories,These four blondes all lack character. It was a painful read. Each of these women is unlikable and all they seem to care about is their beauty and men with money. Don't waste your money or your time.
2,Don't think all blondes are like these blondes..,"Ok.... So I really really really wanted to enjoy this book. As a blonde myself, I thought it would be a fun book, sort of like a combination of Sex and the City and Legally Blonde. I thought perhaps it would place blondes in an important position where they prove everyone, including themselves, wrong about some sort of stereotype. Perhaps it was because I had these expectations that I was seriously let down by the book. These blondes are not heroines... they don't even come close. I honeslty could have cared less about these four girls, none of them are relatable (is that a word??) at all. Perhaps Candace Bushnell does normally write for newspapers... but has she never read a novel in her life?? Where's the intrigue, the importance, the plot?? Anyhow, if its an interesting heroine you're after, buy Bridget Jones, not 4 Blondes"
1,Am I the only one who hated this?,"This is the one of the WORST books I've read in a long time! The writing was disjointed and repetitious and the characters were boring and self involved. This book should have been called ""When Good Things Happen to Shallow, Underserving People"". As a major fan of Sex and the City, I was SERIOUSLY disappointed with this effort. Hated it!!"
1,"Can you say ""dreck""?","I cannot believe how insipid and tasteless this book is. It depicts women as vapid, directionless bimbos who only exist to be seen in the right shoes. I can even decide if the author was maybe lampooning this type of woman, because there was no sense of tongue-in-cheek to this. It was just horrible. If you see this book, run the other way."
2,Not that great,"Being a huge fan of the TV show, I thought I'd check out this novel by Candace Bushnell. Boy, was I disappointed. I only really enjoyed one of the segments...the rest were so silly & unbelievable.Anyway, I guess I'm lucky, because 1) I checked it out from the library and 2) it was the audio version (read by Cynthia Nixon, who plays Miranda on the show). So, see if your local library has it!"
1,Mindless chatter,"I'm a big fan of Sex and the City, so I thought I would give the novels of Candace Bushnell a try. Either I had too many expectations for this book or it was just plain dumb. I say 50/50. The main charcter was horrible and rude, I could not relate to to her and her stupid antics. I gave the book two chances and the second time I tried to read it I wanted to use the book to give myself a paper cut, that would've been a better pain than what I was going through reading this ""book"""
1,4 Blondes,I am sure the only reason this book was even published was Candance Bushnell's Sex in the City success. This book isn't worth the paper it is written on. After the first story I skimmed the second and couldn't even finish the third or begin the fourth. This book isn't even worth 1 star. Stick with Sex in the City!
2,Pass on this one...,It is not horrid it is just not good. Borrow it from a friend or something as it is not one of those books that you'd be happy spending cash on. The writing seems primary and there is no real satisfaction in the characters. It was fluff ...but not even good fluff. It was like fake whipped cream over real whiped cream.If you want to indulge in a easy read book like this pick something else.
2,Don't bother buying it.,"I started this book in an aiport bookstore and somewhat enjoyed the first story. When I arrived at my destination I bought thinking the other 3 Blondes would have interesting lives. Unfortunatley, they didn't. Don't bother reading past the first quarter of this book."
2,'sex and the city' this is not,"I am not suggesting that everything Candace Bushnell writes should be just like 'Sex and the City,' but this book is pretty awful. I was looking forward to a juicy and witty end of summer read, and instead found myself bitterly saddened by these empty and somewhat contrived stories. The last story about a journalist writing about sex and England was the worst. I would only recommend this book to the most diehard fan."
4,Very Entertaining......Considering I'm a blonde!!!,I thought that the book was very good. It kept my interest from beginning to end. I like how the book had different segments w/differnt characters. I thought each character was very interesting especially Princess Cecelia who thought everybody was out to get her. Her life was just so hard (yeah right) that she had to cause problems for herself.Then there was Winnie & James Dieke also very interesting people. I could go on and on and on about the charcters in this book but you should read it for yourself to get the full effect.Absolutely a thumbs up on this book.
1,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting ""Sex and the City"" and got nothing of that. I was expecting the tale of 4 friends, not 4 separate people who's lives are linked together by 1 man or another. I would have expected Bushnell to have a more witty, humorous take in this book. While I didn't expect a happy ending for each woman, I at least thought there would be a positive message. Instead it was wrought with the vanity of 4 women who can't seem to deal with the lives they made for themselves. I was really dissapointed."
2,not that great,"this book was very confusing, very repetitve, and overall didn't have that great of a plot. it wasn't that great and i lost interest very quickly"
1,Top TEN Worst Books I have Read Could NOT Finish,"I do not understand how books like this get published? If this book can get published, ANY book can! REALLY the worst book I have ever read. I actually did not read the entire book as it was so bad and made no sense it was impossible to finish. It became nonsensical jibberish...."
2,Uneven and Disappointing,"There should be a law banning Candace Bushnell from writing in the first person. When she does, she's annoying, screechy, and unbearable. Unfortunately, she chooses to write two of the four novellas that comprise ""Four Blondes"" in the first person. The other two are decent and entertaining reads, and both stories could be interpreted as forming the basis for Bushnell's best novel ""One Fifth Avenue."" One deals with an over-the-hill model's attempts to settle down with a billionaire husband, and the other deals with a power couple that somehow find to hate each other humanely. The second story is by far the best of the collection, and the couple's story is continued in ""One Fifth Avenue."""
1,IF YOU THOUGHT TRADING UP WAS BAD,THIS IS THE WORST BOOK....I THOUGHT TRADING UP WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD. ONE OF THE CHARACTERS FROM THIS BOOK IS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN TRADING UP.THE STORIES ARE HARD TO FOLLOW THEY ARE SO BORING...DREADFUL
2,Not the best work by Bushnell!,"This book is simply snippets of unfinished work! I bought it at an extremely reduced price, but it still wasn't worth the price. You have to know the characters from her other novels to even understand what she's talking about! Not worth the price!"
3,I wanted it to be better.,"As a huge fan of ""Sex and the City"", I was so looking forward to reading this book. The first ""novella"" about Janey, was painstakingly boring. I found it impossible to sympathize with her character, and the ending was pat and unsatisfying. The other three stories were a little better, the last one about the nutjob princess being the most interesting of the book. Being a native Californian, I found the author's descriptions of New York society lifestyle very amusing and curious. Overall it was interesting enough for me to finish it, but it left me somewhat disappointed and unfullfilled."
1,I hated this more than anything,"I picked up this book because I was looking for something light and fun. I love the show Sex and the City, and as a single girl living in Manhattan, I thought this would fit the bill.I hated this book. The characters were mostly shallow drug addicts and alcoholics who all thought they were too good to be with anyone who was ""just a regular guy"".I actually felt bad for men in NYC after I read this because these characters made all women look like they are trying to be manipulative to get what they want, but ultimately not that smart and not in touch with reality at all.Please do not even waste your money"
2,Better suited for TV,"Since I don't have cable, I only see Sex in the City when at a friend's house, but I think the show is entertaining and can certainly see why it is popular. Four Blondes, on the other hand, proved to be a difficult read in that I had to discipline myself to finish it. The fourth and last section was the best and is worth reading on its own, but it couldn't make up for the lengthy third section which was the weakest piece in the book with wooden characters who are difficult to identify with and an overblown plot. Keep watching the TV show and skip this book."
2,Disappointing Book From a Talented Author,"We all like Sex in the City. Candace, what happened? This is such a disappointment from such a talented writer. I'm sorry I spent the [amt] on the hardback...and the 5 hours of wasted time reading it. The characters in this book are so shallow and vacuous that it only served to depress me. Was that the point? I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I was able to finish it. Perhaps I kept reading hoping it would improve? Bottom line: don't waste your time or money."
1,Not worth it,I received this book as a gift and actually enjoyed the first chapter. But the rest of the book was miserable...I only finished it because I felt i had to. The characters were very uninteresting and the writing actually gave me a headache at one point. Don't bother with this one.
1,A complete shallow nightmare!,"this book was sooo bad. i kept reading hoping that it would get better, but it never did. a complete waste of my time, don't waste your's...unless you're into shallow pointless books."
1,a book about horrible people,"I loved her sex and the city book and thought I would try to read another one, but this book was about horrible people. I read about 125 pages and then donated it to the library."
1,"What a crock, and depressing","If you know anyone like these 4 blondes, I pity you. I almost always finish a book, but just couldn't with this one---way too boring and depressing. And I've never disliked a book enough to write a review. Pls. don't waste your time on this one. Not sure what the author was thinking, maybe she knows women like this, but why in the world would she write about them? Total waste of my time, and likely the author's."
2,Not worth the time...,"This is definitely not one of Bushnell's best books--by far. It is actually 4 shorter stories. I am on the 3rd and so far, the only one worth my time was the 1st. But, I keep reading thinking that maybe I'll figure out why the book got published..."
2,Just OK,"A cleverly presented book in which each of the 4 blondes has her own 80 or so page short story that moved along at a very breezy pace. This book reminded me of the Jackie Collins stories I enjoyed in the 1980s! Although very witty and well-written, I fear I must be getting old because reading about the excessive sexual behavior and drug use of wealthy, but very shallow charracters, didn't fascinate me as it once did."
2,"Terrible, horrible, awful!","This book makes me so happy that I am not single, living in New York City. I didn't find this book funny, interesing or entertaining. It is not worth the money to buy and not worth the time or paper to read."
1,My Gosh...this was bad.,My 16-year-old cousin loved this book and lent it to me. As a 30-yr-old it looked like a sassy read. Boy was I wrong. I read about 1/4 of it and had to stop. I didn't want to waste another moment of my life reading this book.
2,bad to worse,"I'm a fan of ""chick lit"", however when I read this book I didn't think it was good at all. The only parts I liked were the smart quotes or one-liners. I could barely even finish the book, It was mildly interesting in the beginning, but then it gets much worse as it progresses."
1,The worst book I think I've ever read.,"This book was truly awful. I bought it because I am a big fan of the Sex in the City tv show, so I thought I would enjoy a book by Candace Bushnell. Ya right! This book is so boring and has no point at all. In fact I only read half the book and couldn't force myself to read anymore I was so bored. The character development was awful- you don't even care who you are reading about. Honestly I can't think of a book I have read that I hated more!"
2,"Shallow, Rambling, and in need of some real people","HBO's Sex in the City is a great series, so I thought I would pick up this book because the reviews on the back were pretty good. Unfortunately this book is a real failure. I'm a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver who wrote the Bean Trees, Pigs In Heaven, and many other brilliant works. I guess you could call Bushnell a one hit wonder. This book gives you some in depth character depictions of people who aren't really that deep. It rambles, really doesn't have a good writing structure. Every other sentence is in parenthesis. The characters are so shallow and unreal that it's nearly impossible to get through. If you really want to attempt to read it, go to the library. A decent beach read, if you want more sex than cosmo magazine. But hardly worth [price]."
1,Very Disappointed,We used this book for our book club reading and we were all disappointed with the book. It started out pretty well and then it just went downhill from the first story. I couldn't even finish the 4th story. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone to read.
4,Bushnell has another winner,"Once again, Candace Bushnell proves her superiority as an observer and as a writer. She accurately picks up on the stereotypes of those personalities which so frequently flourish best in Manhattan and East Hampton. Anyone who hasn't been to these places may not appreciate how dead-on are her portrayals. With a writing style that is spare and distinctive, FOUR BLONDES makes an interesting read. Ultimately, all the heroines in it are empowered, making this is the best kind of post-feminist fiction, thought-provoking without being preachy."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is the worst book ever written. I would rather watch paint dry than read another sentence in this trashy novel. I always finish the books I pick up, but this one was not worth it. No point in wasting MY brain cells when reading about these slutty, bitchy, druggie girls wasting their lives away.BTW: I LOVE Sex in the City. This book is nothing like the show."
1,I can't believe I actually read this,"I don't know what possessed me to finish this book, which showed its vacuity within the first 10 pages. The characters are one-dimensional (not to mention sad and pathetic), nothing happens to them to transform them from their sad and pathetic states, and the most I can say I learned from this book is a greater understanding of the social dynamics of the Hampton Jitney.If you already have a negative opinion of the Botox and Beemers set, this book will only reinforce it. Makes one wonder how Bushnell could've been the one behind ""Sex and the City."" Whatever made that series click is totally absent here."
4,"Like a cosmo - sweet, fashionable & strictly for fun","You love HBO's Sex & the City, and maybe you've read the book or even Bushnell's Observer columns. With Bushnell's Blondes you get what you paid for: A light interesting read with quirky characters set against a glamorous but sharp edged backdrop. The first and second stories have some substance and keep your attention - then just when you think Bushnell might actually have a message, bam, an easy ending. The third and fourth stories seem like she just tossed something off to meet her 100,000 word contract.In the end, though, the stories are light and fun - perfect for reading at Sag Main Beach and sparking conversation with the crew from your summer share."
4,Shallow People At Their Best,"The new tales from author Candace Bushnell, pick up right where she left-off. While this isn't a sequel to ""Sex and the City"" (which, I might add is WONDERFUL) it has the same tone and demeanor. These tales of New York City women and their lives are filled with sex, money, and well.....being shallow. Yes, these are the shallowest bunch of people I have ever read about. And, I loved it. It's the perfect way to escape into a world that very few of us will ever realize or experience. This hip and wealthy world of New York celebrity is full of ego's and the people who ""rule the world."" While this isn't the BEST book I've ever read, (it's divided into sections with different characters) I found it exciting and a delightful and naughty treat. Recommend for the less adventures readers. It's not difficult but, fun all the same."
3,Good Read,I found most of this book very good with a few exceptions. It is definitely just for fun and not an excellently written book! I love Sex & the City and enjoyed a couple of the characters in this one. I would definitely read Candace's next book! It's a guilty reading pleasure.
2,beach read,"Not a bad way to spend an afternoon......if you're bored and have nothing better to do, this book will suffice as light entertainment. The four characters are interesting simply because I can't believe women like this actually exist and it's like a lab experiment to see what they would do next."
1,Bad condition,"The book came to me in bad condition... I don't know if I will even read it or just throw it out. Too bad, I was looking forward to reading it!"
1,NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL,What is the point of all the stories? The stories start out just fine but there is no sense to how it endsNot recommended
3,Faux Glitter and empty heads.,"You love them, you pitty them, you will remember them.Four different stories of women who want to believe in something more and are trapped in their old and bad habits. It gives you a sneak peak into the reality of beautiful, blonde, babes with fake boobs and unfulfilled fantasies.LA LA Land."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Loved SATC (the series) and even enjoyed to an extent Trading Up (its a good airplane book). BUT this was awful. I got it on cd to listen to at work. I stopped after the first disc. The character Janie is almost exactly the same as the character Janie (go figure) in Trading Up, but less developed. Just don't waste your time or money, check out something that has a better plot, story line, character development and meaning."
1,Less than One Star,"Sorry, but this book does not even warrant a One Star rating. It was a big waste of my money and my time, and reading is one of my favorite pastimes. Not only does everything jump around, but the author's constant use of parentheses and/or all capitals to make a point, really really made it hard to concentrate on the story (if you could call it a STORY) LOL."
1,I wanted to scrape this book off the bottom of my shoe,"But I settled on throwing it in the trash instead, literally. Reprehensible characters and a writing style completely devoid of any imagination. How on earth did this get published? I don't know what social circles Ms. Bushnell is in, but I haven't met any woman who would prostitute herself in order to spend a summer at the Hamptons. Ms. Bushnell, you are ""soooo over."""
1,A perfect example...,"...of an author who must've won her book contract in a sweepstakes. With so many promising and aspiring writers out there, I cannot believe she continues to receive the support of a publishing house."
1,"Page 6, the novel","More tripe from Bushnell, who makes Tama Janowitz (the woman with big hair who wrote Slaves of NY) seem like Tolstoy. Reading about the shallow inner lives of people who dwell on the fringes of the rich and famous makes us feel good about ourselves-- we may not have the house in the Hamptons or know Brad Pitt, but at least we're happy. It's a style, and Bushnell has got it down pat. Three of the stories are readable in a ""thank God that's not me"" kind of way. The fourth, about a married writer, is sort of sad-- it almost seems as if Bushnell is jabbing back at all the ""serious journalists"" who think she's some fluffy little slut. In the autobiographical final story, I couldn't help but wonder (as I often did with her NY Observer columns): ""If you know better-- and you obviously do-- why do you keep hanging out with all these pathetic status-obsessed losers?"" While it's sometimes a fun read, this book does not give us the answers."
2,Is This The SAME Person Who Wrote Sex & The City????,"I fell helplessly in love w/ that series. The girls felt like my extended girlfriends. I could connect with them on so many levels. But not here! I am not a blonde, but please tell me that my hair color is not the only thing to keep me totally enthralled. The characters were really too dumb & too shallow. I can't imagine anyone thinking like these four blondes did on a regular basis. I was looking for some bubblegum for the brain here & some laughs. I saw glints of Bushnell's humor & spicy wit, but felt my bubblegum had been scraped off from under a subway seat somewhere!Sorry, folks- I do hate do be a downer, but there's no way to compare this w/ S&TC.; If you're still led to venture into it, buy a used copy & forget this same author introduced us to Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, & Samantha!"
1,"If you buy this book, buy it used!","I found Candace Bushnell's writing style scattered, awkward, and at times difficult to follow. She describes the characters personalities in way too much detail, which only makes them seem like a robot instead of a real person. I only finished the book out of principle, and won't recommend it to anyone else."
2,Cheap blondes,"Being a huge fan of the HBO series, ""Sex and the City,"" I had high hopes for this book. Fortunately they were dashed. There is no real wit here, and all the characters just seemed sad. I suppose one could argue that the girls of ""Sex"" are/were mainly sleeping around and caring more about accessories and looking good, but somehow the writing and the acting makes them fleshed out and interesting. You feel you know them, can relate to one or all of them. I never got that with these 'Four Blondes.' It just felt empty. I'd suggest reading through it more carefully at the bookstore before buying, or that you borrow it from a friend or the library. It might just be me, but this coming from the woman whose idea and columns sparked 'Sex and the City' it just is a letdown."
1,Short stories...,"I am not a big fan of short stories but for some reason the cover and synopsis made me want to read this book. Big mistake... I think I was expecting ""Sex in the City"" but got stories that ended just as they got interesting and characters that you could not relate to nor even be amused by...."
1,When you're stuck in the middle seat...,"The four blondes of the title are each stupid, self-centered, vain and completely unlikable. Needless to say, the men fare even worse. Even more disappointing, there really isn't a plot -- each storyline ends abruptly, with no real sense that anything has changed for the characters. ..."
1,4 Blondes,"I am a huge fan of Sex and the City on HBO. So, I purchased this book hoping for some feminine insight. Not only was I disappointed in this book, but wasted a good seven bucks I could have spent on an iced mocha latte. The characters are well developed, but the stories themselves lack any content but trash. Drug use, and sex are both represented, but it was of the raunchy type with no real substance. The most disappointing aspect of these stories are the endings, which are abrupt and not well developed. It seems like not much thought went into the endings...they just end."
1,This is the WORST book I have EVER read.,"I am so absolutely disappointed in Candace Bushnell's book. I had purchased it at the last minute before I boarded a plane on a business trip and what a waste of [money]. The characters are self-centered and unrelatable to. There is also never resolution to the situations ( if you can call them that) the characters face. The book outline leads you to believe that they resolve the situation that they are in, but it never happens. Their major concerns in life are still sleeping around for a summer house, and going back to cheating/miserable husbands and taking drugs. The characters never develop, and the women are portrayed kind of like Allie McBeal, needy and doing anything they can to get attention while destroying the people and relationships around them. All in all, I would rather stick with the the television show. I won't even pass it on to any of my friends - this is one for the circular files and a match."
1,4 Pathetic Blondes...,"Knowing of Candace Bushnell only through the HBO version of Sex and the City, I had high expectations for this book. To say the very least, my expectations were not met. The four women featured in the book were completely unlikeable and ridiculous. Their shared trait, aside from being blonde, is that they are willing to prostitute themselves in order to improve their image. The stories seemed to be incomplete, yet I was not left wanting more -- I was just glad that I was one story closer to the end. The book was depressing rather than witty and amusing as I had expected. I can only imagine that the publication of this book was the result of having a successful television series with which to associate the author. Don't be fooled as I was -- this is no ""Sex and the City."""
2,"Fun, quick read","This book is not exactly a brilliant literary work, and I found some parts of it to be rather strange. But if you are looking for a quick, light read then I would recommend it. It took me one plane ride to finish it because of Bushnell's simple writing style. There are many parallel's to her show, ""Sex and the City,"" which added further entertainment. Overall, I finished this book feeling like I should dye my hair blonde, begin a modeling career, and sleep with numerous wealthy men."
1,atleast the title wasn't misleading,"It is apperant from the very first page that this book is a pitiful excuse to talk about sex. The only reason I continued to read this mindless drivel was to discover the point of the story to justify the authors reputability, but it never came. The story was empty, with absolutley no meaning behind the words that were written, and the writing style was inconsistent with the change of each chapter. This book is definatley not worth the money or the time."
3,Ups and downs,"This book was a good book. It had its ups and downs. One of the short stories had its slow parts, but I got threw it. It was the tale of four diffrent blondes, with four diffrent problems or habits in there life. Bushnell didn't hold anything back. She said what she wanted to say about sex and drugs. Some parts were funny some parts were sad. It leave you wondering what the charters are doing now. It almost leaves room for more information but it doesn't. It is a good light book to read."
1,YAWN - An utter bore,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I kept forging ahead thinking there must be some redeeming episode, but there was nothing the slightest bit amusing in any of the 256 pages. If I'd read the Amazon reviews I would have known to steer clear of this ..."
3,Not the best,"I bought this book a long time ago, but I just got the opportunity to read it recently. I have to say, one way that I judge a book is how I feel after reading it and whether I could do the same thing. This book had nothing that special about it, and, honestly, after I finished reading it I starting planning my own book (maybe about 4 brunettes?) I thought the characters were pretty annoying, and I thought that after reading the very first chapter of Janey Wilcox's story. I think if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the third one with Princess Cecilia; the story was the most interesting. I gave it three stars because it provided pretty good entertainment for the morning commute, but it is definitely not a book that I will be re-reading and recommending to others (though I do have some friends who would definitely appreciate it)."
1,This was awful,"I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, so I started with high expectations. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst books I read in my life. Each story was bland, and there was no real conclusion at the end of each story. When I finished the book I was wishing I spent my time reading something else. These women were neurotic, paranoid, and completely self-absorbed. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Huge Disappointment,Bought this book at Goodwill and quickly realized that the $2 I paid for it was too much. Read the first story and skimmed the other three. Utterly obnoxious and quite disturbing. Definitely not a relaxing and humorous chick lit read that I was looking forward to.
1,Not what I thought,I should have read reviews before purchasing. I read the first section and then put it down. Even the first section was just ok.
1,Thank God I got this on sale,"All I have to say is that I could only make it to page 66, and I took a 3 month break in between all that. Its completely unrelatable, and the ""sex"" is disturbing, not sexy. I'm extremely disappointed. Gonna try to get store credit. This only became a best seller because of who she is, not the content of the book. HORRIBLE."
1,"""Sophomoric"" Effort","Here's what you do:Pick up the book (don't BUY it just pick it up)Turn to page 98 (hardcover edition)Under the passage entitled ""Winnie's Bad Habit"" is a sentence:""Boring and Utterly Pointless""A precise assessment of the book ""Four Blondes"" if ever there was one....And just so you don't think ""sour grapes""...I'm a beautiful blonde from NYC (who hopefully won't have a building collapse on my head after that last remark!)"
1,Awful!,"All of the reviewers got it right. This book is awful! Long, boring, repetitive, inane...these stories are not highlights, and they are not entertaining."
2,A little disappointing.....,"By the way as a native New Yorker (the greatest city in the world by the way!!!), I know a lot of ""smart blondes"".....The characters are well crafted as Candace Bushnell does, it was disappointed in the Janey story, Janey should have got the real estate job and worked her way up to the top seling houses ine which is what i thought was going to happen... all of the sudden she gets a Victorias secret offer and poof! she has her own house in CA... it was good that she bought it on her own and no man bought it for her but would have been better if she worked her way up selling real estate in the Hamptons.....that was a bit disappointing, but maybe that would have been boring"
4,Recommended light reading,"I'm in the middle of writing my master's thesis, looking for a job, relocating to another state, working two part-time jobs as well as being a mom and a wife. I needed a light, easy read this summer, and I found it. No, this isn't a thought-provoking, insightful look into human character. If Bushnell's characters lack depth, it's because the characters themselves won't allow themselves depth. They live in superficiality, and I find them to be believable characters. I enjoyed this book. When life settles down and I'm ready for something heavier, I'll turn to Irving, Anne Tyler and those ilk. Four Blondes is fun."
1,Don't bother,"I am an avid reader and a fan of Sex and the City but this book was a big disappointment. Don't waste your money or time on this one. If the author had not been involved with the popular tv show, I don't think this book would have even gotten a second look from book publishers."
3,Not hilarious- but worth the read.,"While this book is not the fun-fest promised by the professional reviews, I think there is some merit to be found inside the covers. The women in these stories are not like any of us, this much is true. They are all rich and/or famous. However, there are parts of all of us in these women; insecurity, anxiety, ambition, even lust and love. I did not laugh at any of these womens' lives, but I did empathize... at least in part."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have been watching Sex and The City since episode one and had high expectations for this book. What a disappointment! These are the worst characters ever written. I've read that Ms. Bushnell writes from her own experiences. If this is true I feel very sorry for her. What a shallow, useless life the women characters lead. These four blondes give women everywhere a bad name. I enjoy a good, fun trashy novel once in a while. If this is what you are looking for look elsewhere. The author does know how to tell a story, she just needs to go back to the drawing board and completely start over."
1,Not enough to survive the longest flight in the world!,"I can't believe I actually spent money on this. Desperation at the airport is the worst thing, but i'd rather read the inflight magazine (including the ads)13 times and speak to the annoying woman beside me for 6 hours instread of subjecting myself to this book. Who prints this stuff?"
1,For once T.V. is better than a book!,"As a faithful watcher of Sex and the City I really thought I was in for a treat to read Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes. But I soon learned I should stick to watching HBO reproduce her idea.The books is actually four short novellas about young, wealthy, beautiful and glamourous women and their sex lives. And little else. The author leaves each of the four stories unfinished with loose ends. There was little substance to each story and then an arubt, but certainly welcome from the boredom of reading it, botchy ending.If you have heard of Candace Bushnell and are thinking of giving her books a go, I would definitely suggest skipping the author and going straight to your television set and watching an episode of Sex and the City."
1,What was I thinking ....,"This is defnintely not worth the time reading. I love Sex in the City but I think the author just decided to write ""nothing"" and call it a book. Four short stories about nothing women, doing nothing with life and sleeping with everyone. It was very poorly written. Ugh!"
1,A Literary Fiasco,There is little to say about this book that has not already been said. So here it is: One of the worst books even written. Period. Don't say we didn't warn you.
1,Maybe it'll make for a good HBO series...,"As an avid viewer of HBO's ""Sex and the City,"" I was curious to read from the author of the book which the show is based on. I picked up ""Four Blondes"" hoping to find memorable characters like Carrie Bradshaw, frankness with social-taboos and biting humor. Instead I found four stories with characters that, for the most part, make you want to scream because they are so stupid and shallow. Their stories are pretty dull, too. Sure, the open sex-talk is there, but it didn't open my eyes the way ""Sex and the City"" does. ""Four Blondes"" is totally devoid of anything meaningful."
4,"Easy read of glamrous, spoiled socialites","Bushnells ""Four Blondes"" is an easy read, while providing some humor. While ""Sex and the City"" jumped from character to character, this book provides four Chapters each centering around a different character, painfully similiar to ""Valley of the Dolls"". Each chapter is fun to read, but I was somewhat dissapointed with the last one. It didn't quite seem to ""fit"" with the rest of the book. It was very vague and much shorter then the previous 3. I liked this book for its sharp wit and typical New York sarcasm. In short, if you enjoyed ""sex and the city"", I reccomend this book for a fun summer read, but don't expect anything too different."
3,Four Blondes,"The book is split into 4 different stories revolving around 4 different (blonde) characters. The first story is pretty good. So I quickly moved onto the next blonde. Not as good as the first. It seemed to drag. And the longer it dragged, the less sympathy (and at times, interest) I had for the characters. The third one made me continually question why I was reading the book. I kept going because I was sure that something major was about to be revealed to make the reader understand the characters actions. Never happened. I feared my face would retain the bewildered expression that it had taken on during the third story. The final story was the worst. It was boring, pointless and ended very abruptly to be immediately followed by me hurling the book across the room."
1,Dull Blondes,"This has got to be the most utterly boring book I have ever read. I struggled to get past the first story let alone all four. Admittedly it was fairly amusing in parts but the characters were so depressingly dreadful that I couldnt have cared one way or another what happened to them or their whinging oddball lives. I thoroughly enjoy Sex and the City, hence buying the book for my holiday, what a disappointment. Save your money!"
1,The 16th Minute...,"Sorry Candace, but your 15 minutes are up. Like most, I adored Sex and The City and still love the HBO series but this book makes Bushnell look Bush-league. Hard to believe it was the same author...not at all the enjoyable experience of her debut. Sad...but best skipped."
2,Four Blondes,"This book was a waste of money. There were some good parts but not enough to merit the cost. Each story starts out slow, gets a little interesting and then abruptly ends. We are only given glimpses of the lives of the people in the book and you feel as if you are still waiting on the ""climax"" when each story ends."
1,Awful,"Do not waste your money on this trash. It was totally obnoxious, hard to get into, and a waste of time. Bushnell really sunk low to write this novel, which mirrors cheesy, tacky, and AWFUL romance novels. DO NOT READ- SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Self absorbed and terribly written,"If you want to read a book about a bunch of completely self-absorbed and uninteresting characters, pick this up. I was so dissappointed I was horrified that this was written by the woman whose claim to fame is my beloved HBO's ""Sex and the City"". Having not read the book, I can only hope that it is far better than this one. The characters lack any depth whatsoever, and don't even actually do anything interesting except sit around all day complaining, and waiting for something magical to happen. It's so stupid I'm shocked anyone actually published it. Note to self: Do not keep reading terrible books that you think have some fabulous moral at the end. Just put it down, and walk away."
1,Waste of Money,"This book is nothing but pathetic rubbish and is fit only for the dumpster. Most surprising of all is that I thought I'd relate to the characters as I'm a pretty savvy, late 20's blonde in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the only time this would be mildly amusing is after one too many cosmopolitans."
1,Why was this written???,"This book was so bad...I read a lot of books and I don't have time to write a review about them all, but I couldn't even get past the second story....what possed Candace Bushnell to write this book....I mean Sex in the City was great....this was a total loser...just hope I can get something for it when I turn it in to the used book store...This is NOT one I want in my collection"
1,Mindless and not entertaining whatsoever.,"OK. I walk into the bookstore. I pick up 4 blondes, thinking that it won't be anything but entertaining....a simple read that may be enlightening. How bad can it be right? It's on the bestseller list. It can't be THAT bad, can it? Was I wrong. Don't get me wrong. I like mindless entertaining books too, but this is a mindless one without any laughs, any direction, and the stories drag on, for what it seems like forever. To say this book was bearable is being generous. These women depicted in the stories are money-hungry, sex animals, and without value, ambition, etc. This is seriously not a good depiction of women whatsoever. Read it and you'll be sorry."
1,Sex and the City it's not,"I am a big fan of the show, Sex and the City, so I thought this book would be the same mix of humor, strong characters, cosmopolitian style and heart.The book was a big dissapointment. The characters were all shallow and the stories seemed pointless. The reader does not become invested in the characters at all. I would not recomend this to anyone. Meaningless fluff is suppossed to be fun and this book was not. If you are a fan of Sex and the City either read Candace Bushnell's book, Sex and the City or watch the show. Either experience would be better than wasting time to read this book."
5,Tells it like it is....,"I LOVED this book. Finally I book that says what we successful women already know, don't be afraid to go after what you want. In the end, you only have yourself, so make yourself happy. The best story in the book is Platinum. The other people who rated this book obviously don't know what it's like to live in the world that these women face everyday. It's hard to be beautiful."
3,Very Interesting,"I always know a book is written well when I can't put it down, and thats exactly what happened. What I like is how the author went into much detail of what the women was thinking at that exact moment, and it was also interesting how she protrayed the depression of one of them (story #3). It was amazing.I was disappointed in one story and that was the second, their was definetly many climax's in that story but every time I thought something really exciting/horrible thing was gonna happen it didn't.Overall the book was fairly well and I do recommend it to other women, I'm sure you'll relate to at least one of them in some aspect."
3,The point?,"I am often game for light entertaining books. This however, was neither. The characters are impossible to relate to. Overall, there is simply no real plot to this book. I was very disappointed."
1,Horrible,"I just finished reading ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and thought that this book would be another lighthearted, amusing read. Was I ever wrong. This book was HORRIBLE!! The characters were not developed and the plot was even more superficial. I have never missed an episode of ""Sex"" so I never imagined that I wouldn't like this book. Don't waste your time!"
1,Man-Hater,"I love men. For all their faults, they have a lot to offer a woman. This book doesn't show that men are worthy creatures at all. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE the Sex in the City TV show. I just hate the way Bushnell makes men appear to be a hinderance to women."
1,Four Blondes by Candace Bushnell,What an utter bore. Characters were flat and insipid. Nothing even remotely charming or funny. Waste of time.
4,Excellent!,This was a great book. Very witty and enjoyable; however the last two stories were not as good as the first. They lacked a lot of substance that the first two had.
2,utterly boring and tasteless,"I watched sex and the city and fell in love with it. However, four blondes was a disappointment. I read two of the short stories and found it a waste of time. With the support of glamourous stars and clothings, it may be good TV materials. Without, it is utterly boring and tasteless."
2,Lackluster,"This book was really pretty boring. The characters were vacuous (although that was the point, I suppose). There were no redeeming qualities to ANYONE in the entire book!"
1,VERY VERY OFFENSIVE RUBBISH,"This must be the worst book ever written.All the stories are boring but the fourth one was downright offensive.Mizz Bushnell just used this story to talk aload of [...] about the English.I am English and I found this book offensive in the extreme.Also it's a load of [...] I bet she has never been to England in her life,let's hope she keeps it that way .If I could bring [...] I would for this book."
1,A waste of time.,"This book was honestly awful. There was no plot, and the characters are un-realistic and un-interesting. I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book, and I HATE not finishing a book. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Blondes - Four points of view,"The four blondes are ultra similar in their self-absorption-for each it's all about me, me, me, men, men, men and money, money, money. Each has boatloads of ""friends"" yet each finds herself ultra alone in the world. Each runs with the A-list crowd. The collection of stories could have been ultra-repetitive. But Bushnell deftly chose different literary points-of-view for each story. Janey is searching for her man in third-person limited. The dysfunctional couple, James and Winnie, are written in an edgy present-tense by an all-seeing, all-knowing, unnamed narrator (Bushnell herself of course) so we get healthy doses their thoughts about each other. And nutty Princess Cecelia could only tell us her own story-and she does-in the first person. The seemingly simple, yet important choice of point-of-view, written by a skilled author turns a good, yet potentially repetitive book into an good collection."
1,"poorly written, boring","I wasn't expecting sex and the city, but I was expecting an interesting, well-written book that I could ""get into"". There was absolutely no depth to the writing - and I'm not referring to the morality of the characters (although they're shallow as well). I couldn't lose myself in this book, and trust me, I can read anything. The details that give a story substance and make it come alive were missing. If you're desperate, I suppose you can try it, but don't waste your money buying it."
1,Do such vacuous people really exist?,"The other reviewers seem to have covered it: shallow, spoiled characters living in some alternate universe that may or may not exist in elite New York. I had to make a correction: ""Winnie"" is said to be a graduate of Smith College (ahem, the women's college) but then a few pages later she knew a male doctor because ""they went to college together"". [In Sex and the City, Charlotte is said to have gone to Smith then later meets with her ""sorority sisters from college"". There are no sororities at Smith.]. As a Smith grad, I don't mind Bushnell using it to exemplify something stereotypical, but how hard is it to find an editor who knows that Smith is a women's college?"
2,Okay,"Being a fan of Candace Bushnell's ""Sex and the City"" I thought that I would give this book a try. I have to say, I am somewhat disappointed.The first story ""Nice 'n' Easy"" was okay. About Janey Wilcox a girl whom every summer has sex with a guy so she can stay in his house in the Hamptons, but in the end is able to afford her own home in the Hamptons. The rest of the stories I did not like. Candace Bushnell has writing talent, but some of her characters are uninteresting and snobby.If you must read this book borrow it from a friend, don't buy it. It's definitely not worth the money. ""Sex and the City"" is much better than this book."
1,Not worth the walk from the shelves to the register,"Like many of my girlfriends, I was really looking forward to reading this. I'm sorry to say that Bushnell's writing could easily be outdone by a fifteen year old high school student. She manages to make mildly intriguing characters downright dull. Don't get me wrong, I knew in advance that the novel would not bring enlightenment or have any point at all, for that matter. However, I think its fun to step into a world of people so different from oneself. I loved The Secret Diary of Bridget Jones, and there was really no point to that either. I thought this book was insulting to female readers and writers alike. That a writer as unskilled as Busnell can be a bestseller, speaks poorly of the standards which many women expect from literary works. Material like this is so easy to come up with, you'd think that an author should at least have to write it well to sell a book."
2,If you love Sex and the City DO NOT read this,"I was very disappointed with this book...I was so excited to read it, but as I turned the pages it got worse....The stories had no ending to the sad tales of these women....There was absolutely no humor in the lines and above all it was a far cry from the television show...."
2,Lika a car wreck.......,"Like a car wreck I couldn't tear my eyes from the horrificness of this book. I thought it would be a great vacation read: light, funny, and easy entertainment for a week of lounging around. But it wasn't. Although it was darker than I expected, that wasn't what bothered me. What did bother me was the fact that I loathed every single character in the book. Now don't get me wrong, you need a villian in a good story. But this book had too many; there wasn't a single character that I had empathy for, or felt connected to. Disclaimer: I did only read the first story. After starting the second, I just couldn't take any more of the priviledged, self-loathing, superficial, and self-righteous a-holes that ran rampant in this book. Now again, don't get me wrong, I love to hate a wicked villian or two. But only when they're a supporting character to the heroine, not when the villian is the main charchter herself."
1,Very disappointing.,"As an avid Sex and The City fan, I figured I would love this book by Candace Bushnell, who wrote SATC and pretty much created the series. How wrong I was.First of all, this is more like a collection of short stories (""vignettes"") than a book. And each short story is more trite and ridiculous than the last. For instance, the first one is about a party girl who sleeps random men to try to snare a summer house in the Hamptons. The barrage of curse words and overly explicit sexual descriptions totally turned me off; they weren't for emphasis, they were for content.These stories weren't the least bit entertaining, and right as soon as you got a tiny bit interested in someone's life, their chapter would end, and you would get a new spoiled socialite (and the total rundown on her outfit). Useless book."
2,Sex and the city it's not,"Thank goodness I borrowed this book and didn't spend the money to buy it. While Candace Bushnell is a talented writer, the stories in this book are not worth the time you spend reading them (which isn't much). There is nothing redeemable about any of the characters. They are unrealistic and you don't feel invested in their lives at all. By then end of each story, I felt a pang of relief that I no longer had to be a part of their sad, empty lives. A good short story lets you become a part of the character's life and gives you something to think about, these stories just made think, Why?"
1,WASTE OF TIME,"I am an avid viewer of Sex and The City and I truly enjoy the storylines. I was hoping to enjoy this book as much as I enjoy the show. Unfortunately, this was the most unsatisfying book I have ever read. The characters were completely unlikable and the book left you wondering if there was any purpose of their stories being told. The author stopped writing about each of them in the middle of their story and never went back to explain a thing. This was an absolute waste of time and money."
1,Don't Bother,This book is proof that you don't have to be a good writer with a decent story line to be published. This was an incredible waste of time and money.
1,Four Bores,"Four bores. Four vapid, self-centred, flakey, New York bores. To paraphrase a great line from AbFab ""Who cares if they are fat or thin? Who cares if they live or die?"" Reading this book was slightly less interesting than watching paint dry.I normally keep to a 50 page rule. If the book is no good after 50 pages then I bin it. Why, oh why, didn't I stick to that rule? Because this was a gift from a friend who knew I loved Sex And The City. My enjoyment of that book is a measure of my disappointment in this. It has been a long time since I actually wanted to rip a book to pieces but Four Blondes did the trick.I don't care how well observed the characters are. They are bores. Utter, utter bores. Don't buy. You have been warned."
1,Waste of Time!,I expected much more from the writer of Sex and the City. This book has no real plot and horrible character development. There is nothing in any of the characters to identify with and you finish each section wondering what happened. Definitely skip this book and go watch Sex in the City!
1,4 Bombs,"DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS BOOK: Reading it will be tortuous. It leaves you feeling as bored and empty as the characters in the stories (and I use that literary term very loosely here). I loved Sex and the City, Bridget Jones Diary and The Nanny Diaries. 4 Bombs is a shell by comparison. Full of leftover hollow fragments of pitifully uninteresting and empty lives like the ones Ms. Bushnell has unfortunately grown far to comfortable with since her raving success with Sex and the City."
1,blah and depressing,Don't waste your money. It's depressing and badly written. I hope this isn't how NY really is.
2,Not too good,"I was pretty dissappointed with this book. I adore ""Sex and the City"". I was hoping that 4 Blondes would be a cross between ""Sex and the City"" & ""Valley of the Dolls"" as it suggested on the back cover--a little tawdry, and lots of fun. But this book was not fun--it lagged in parts and lacked any sparks overall.I realize that the lead characters were supposed to be shallow and manipulative.Anti-heroes, as opposed to the likeable crop of female protagonists in many books that are currently popular. I know that you weren't supposed to really like these girls. (I applaud Candace Bushnell's efforts to create characters that were so totally the opposite of the Bridget Jones' and even her own character Carrie Bradshaw, for the sake of trying something different.) But the characters were so soul-less that I felt nothing for them, no empathy, no admiration, no dislike, nothing at all.It just felt so empty. The book was conceptually a cool idea, it just didn't pan out."
1,You can judge this book by its cover...,"Let's see... Spoiled, disturbed, ungrateful and Cinderella. These could be the summary characterizations of the four women in this book. I'm surprised by how much I disliked it.For what this book is trying to say, Steve Martin's book, ""Shopgirl,"" is far better, more entertaining and very much more insightful.I also suspect some of Candace Bushnell's concepts were lifted directly from Natalia Ilyin's ""Blonde Like Me,"" another book more readable than this."
2,shallow entertainment,"Read this book if you are looking for shallow entertainment, because that is all you will get! It's short and easy reading (I finished the book in two evenings). If you're thinking of buying it, however, don't! Check it out at your local library."
1,High expectations,"Being a fan of the show ""Sex In The City"", I was looking forward to reading this book. After about 2 chapters, I realized that I should just put it down and find something else. But being an optomist, I pressed on.The characters are shallow and pithy. The storylines are useless and go nowhere. The concept is obviously fashioned by someone who wishes they were inside ""New York Society"" and not writing about it.If you have begun this book, put it down now and go get Harry Potter!"
1,Four Blondes,"The language is offensive, the waste of beauty and privilege is despairing...the only reason I gave it a star is that the cover is cute.Candace Bushnell should be in Therapy herself--a waste of time and $$. I won't even donate it to my library."
4,ET from Mpls,I bought this book for my long flight overseas and finished it before we landed. Good read - mindless material (help me to pass the time).
5,It was so real.,"I thought this book was great. Candace isnt afraid to be honest and forward. The book shows you a whole new perspective on life through different types of peoples' lives. if you like sex and the city, or if u like sex but not porn, then u would definitely like this book. candace is completely open and does so in a tasteful way. check it out!!! (my fav blonde is janey. shes cool)..."
2,More Malaise for the 30something Woman,"I was disappointed in this book. I came to it having read Bridget Jones, The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing, Confessions of a Shopaholic, etc., and this book was not nearly as good. The characters are materialistic and shallow, and I was unable to empathize with any of them. I don't watch STC, so I can't say how this compares, but as for the growing genre of Gen XX chromosome lit., there are better reads than this one out there."
2,Return to sender,"Lame, lame, lame! I couldn't wait to give this book away after struggling with the third and fourth stories for several days and virtually throwing the book at the wall in frustration at such drivel. I really enjoyed the first story of Janey and her search for happiness in the Hamptons (Nice N'Easy), but things went downhill from there. The second story featured an extremely unlikeable harridan, Winnie, and Candace has literally lost the plot with the third and fourth stories. I found these two so irritating and unreadable that I would recommend anyone thinking about getting this book to stop reading it after the second story! She's nasty about English men, which really got my goat (what about Madonna and Guy huh!)so for that alone, she gets a big fat raspberry."
1,What a let down!!!!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, I am a fan of Sex in the City and had heard Candace Bushnell on several radio stations promoting this book. Boy, what a let down. I could not find anything interesting about any of these women, it was more despressing that witty. These women had the most boring lives, if New York society if like this, than you can have it. I found the writing to be simplistic and flat. I know why I still like the series, Candance Bushnell is no longer involved with it."
3,expecting more and got much less,"I bought this book because I enjoyed both Bushnell's previous book: Sex and the City and also the series that came out of it. Thinking I would be titillated by this novel I picked it up and was sadly disappointed. The writing style I adore, that's about the only think I adore. The characters are truly BLONDS of the stereotypes they have become associated with: self absorbed, annoying, pretentious, and living in a vacuum. I really would have loved to give this book five stars but my generosity already inflated it to three stars: that of a mediocre novel, which sadly it is AT BEST."
3,Keep reading ... it gets better,"The first few pages of the book seem useless. Then you enter the life of another blonde, then another, and so forth. At the end, it all comes together and you feel a little better about taking time to read this. As with Sex and the City, it took me awhile to realize there is a little of me in each of these women and I began to identify with them, one by one. I remember the uncertainty of the direction of my life, the questions of love and being true to myself, and now the occasional smugness of marriage. If you like Sex and the City (the novel), Bridget Jones Diary, etc. you will like this one. I read it in 4 days."
2,An unfortunate disappointment,"I too was looking for a great mindless read and was truly dissappointed. Ms. Bushnell's characters are so uninteresting that I cared very little about what happened to them. The book does offer an insider's glimpse into the life of the rich, but Ms. Bushnell is unable to give the reader any reason to either love, hate or admire the characters. No interesting plots, no great twists, not even a steamy love scene. Just a ""month"" in the life of ... The worst part, now I must return Trading Up because I can't imagine reading hundreds of pages about one of these ladies."
1,Four Blondes,Truly disappointing.. since i am a big fan of Sex and the City.The last 2 chapter of the book was so tedious to read because it doesn't make alot of sense.
2,I was expecting so much more,"I grabbed this book thinking it would be one of those fun and easy to read books about a single girl (or in this case girls) in the city. While it is about four single girls in the city, it wasn't nearly the fun book I thought it would be. Each of the four stories came across as very shallow, without a message, and overall dissapointing. The characters rairly had any positive traits, and were in general disgusting people one would not want to meet. The plots were pathetic, and the writing was not great either. Anyone would be better with Bridget Jone's, Nanny Diaries, Fashionista, or any of the other hot and GOOD books about a single girl in the city."
2,"-Okay Start, Finishes Below Par","Candace Bushnell's book 4 Blondes, is a compilation of 4 stories all about characters who are really not very appealing, and therefore difficult to relate to. While the first story is okay, the second story is readable, the third is blah, and the final is an absolute waste of time. I did finish the book, so I guess there was something there that held my attention, but overall it just wasn't up to par."
2,"Too easy for even an ""easy"" read...","I needed something fluffy to read for the summer and couldn't believe how fluffy my pick turned out to be! The first few pages of the book you're thinking... this is gonna get better- until the first story ends and you realize- it's NOT getting better.She does a good job of describing things, I think that there is simply not enough to describe. No plot- a book to borrow if you absolutely must read Bushnell, not a buy."
1,not even worth a star,I am sure those who published this book never read it!!It's totally awful!!I couldn't go from the second page on...Don't buy it - it's throwing out your money!
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!","I love Sex in the City and had hoped that this book would provide similar entertainment. What a disappointment! The characters are pathetic. Each of the four stories ends abruptly, leaving the reader to wonder if perhaps Ms. Bushnell was limited to the number of pages that could be published. I read the entire book (a VERY fast read) hoping it would get better, but alas, no luck. Additionally, the book appears as if the author has just learned the ""F"" word and is intent on using it as much as possible. Read this only if you are curious as to the many ways this word can be used, otherwise, SKIP IT!"
1,Take out the Garbage,This book was pure unadulterated trash. She has set the status of women back immeasureably. Making women loathsome and sleazy does nothing to uplift their image.
3,Not me,This book is 4 stories about 4 different girls. I read the first two. I tried to read the last two but they were depressing and I wasn't in the mood to be depressed.
2,Disappointed,It wasn't what I expected and the pace was too slow. Maybe my expectations were too high after Sex and the city.
4,Good children's book on the Ice Man,I must have ordered too fast and did not notice this is a children's book. I am going to find a child to give it to. It is sophisticated and interesting with some good illustrations. Its one bad point is that it spends time commenting on the Spindler hypothesis of how this ancient man came to his death. I agree with this author that the Spindler theory is illogical and baseless conjecture but the discussion seemed very disjointed and irrelevant. The kids reading this won't know what the author is talking about. This is a minor flaw however.
2,Romance when science is needed,"Learned in its own way, this book is basically a romantic rumination rather than a scholarly examination of a topic -- conversation -- that today attracts more careful minds. Deriding in its early pages how-to-win-in-conversation books, Zeldin advocates a new form of conversation that involves greater levels of openness, creativity, etc., etc. While it is hard to disagree (""no more creativity!""), this hardly bespeaks any understanding of how conversation actually works, for which one is better referred to research in sociology, sociolinguistics, and related fields."
4,"Great info, but sometimes annoying style","This book provided me with tons of valuable information on typography, such that even with my experience in desk-top publishing and web design, I learned a great deal.The only drawback for me was that I found the author's style sometimes annoying and demeaning. The book is replete with comments like ""don't be dumb"", and frankly, I think the same information could be presented in an equally light and humorous manner without constantly implying that if the reader hasn't or doesn't follow all of the author's tips to a ""t"", he/she is somehow stupid, ignorant, etc. I would've enjoyed the book a lot more if Ms. Williams had treated her readers like equals. Teaching is never as effective when the students are being demeaned."
3,"Get the ""The Non-Designer's Design Book"" instead","I'm a big fan of the author, but I feel this is not one of her best books. She clearly illustrates all the important type concepts, but the book felt too long for the amount of information presented.I love her ""The Non-Designer's Design Book"" which concisely covers some of the same information. I've recommended the ""Design Book"" to lots of people but cannot think of anyone I'd recommend the ""Type Book"" to. I would have preferred it as a quick reference companion to the ""Design Book"", maybe at half its current size."
1,Not worth your time or money,"Not much to say here except you get what you pay for. If you want pegs that can't really be placed where you want them, are cheap feeling, will scratch your bars and will move when you use them no matter how tight they are, well, these are your pegs. I regret buying them."
4,Need Univeral HInts that are centuries old.,"Purchased the book because of its influence of this author on William Morris and the later Arts and Craft Movement. The author spoke as an architect who emphasized purchasing well crafted items and goods for the home, and design the entire home with one simple theme throughout the entry hall to the bedrooms. It had an influence on the Arts and Craft designers who started to incorporate textiles, pottery, furniture, and metal works for all of the customer's needs.Beyond the historic references, the book was revealing to the modern designer and family seeking household purchases. All of us inherit lousy furniture and then buy one item at a time, and wonder why the house does not fit together. The author clearly states that we must know and seek out specific items that fit and go together to create a livable"
4,Well-Written but Few Illustrations,"Well-written and informative, but did not fill the need I had. I was looking for something with illustrations and the few line drawings included did not help. Still, I rate it four stars, because it was well-written."
3,nice book,"Great Seller, this is a good book. To bad they do not make furniture like this anymore, if they do the price is outrageous."
2,Not what I thought,This is NOT was I thought it was. I was hopeing for a cool book with nice pictures and ideas for victorian decorating but this is mostly a READING book about the subject. It think it goes more into the history of Victorian decor and do's and donts more so than picture ideas.
2,Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration,It was nothing like I thought it would be. If I had an opportunity to see inside the book I wouldn't have bought it.Maria Gray
5,fresh ideas,"When I first read this book in the Soring of 2002, I likened it to opening a window and filling my lungs with fresh air. I saw patterns, limits, stumbling blocks I had known and experienced as old style power and could detach from those power sources, even if they came from others.New possibilities, strengths and creative solutions followed with a new found intentionality for choices made. In 2003 I am convinced the book is invaluable for leadership in volunteerism, and work, and for personal life changes. Now I am pulling the book's ideas forward again to help do some difficult staff training and development.This is not a long book, but an important read for new perspectives.M.J. Franklin, Volunteer Leader, Adult Educator, Grandparent and Spouse."
5,Great sources,Those books are a great opportunity to dig into Jewish sources and to understand Tanach in a better way!
1,Edward Train,When it was recieved the wheels were broken. I was dissapointed . My son couldnt even use it on his tracks
3,Interesting information & history of the Bonner family,Dr. Bonner has given us soap from his heritage and he gave his family a heritage that they are continuing and enriching.
1,don't waste your money,"in the discription it said these are leather shoes, nothing on these shoes are leather,very disapointed"
5,Amazing !!,"Amazing !This book explained me for the first time the words of the Roman Canon we say at every Mass:""Deign to regard with gracious and kindly attention and hold acceptable, as You deigned to accept the offerings of Abel, Your just servant, and the sacrifice of Abraham our Patriarch, and that which Your hight priest Melchisedech offered to You, a holy Sacrifice and a spotless victim. Most humbly we implore You, Almighty God, bid these offerings to be brought by the hands of Your Holy Angel to Your sublime altar, before the face of Your Divine Majesty.""The book explains that what the priest does during the Mass cames from what the ancient high priests of the first Temple did when in the Holy of the Holies.More: this amazing book also gives a key to better understand the first Christian literature: many themes that no other books succeeded to explain now are very clear."
5,must read book,Spooky how he nailed down what would happen. Very informative. Great history lesson you or your kids will not get through mainstream education.
1,US Air Force Retiree,It saddens me that anyone can find value in this work of a hypocritical racist! Funny how the desired salvation Hoover wanted to bring to America against communism didn't extend to all Americans. A person fighting for their rights in America was labeled a communist by his very organization! I guess it takes a racist dictator to be an expert on communism!
2,Worked great for the first year,"I bought one of these about 2 years ago. It cuts through junk mail and cd's with equal aplomb. During the first year everything worked great. The first malfunction was the automatic paper sensor that is supposed to turn the shredder on when something is placed in the shred path. This wasn't too big a problem as you can turn the shredder on manually. Now however, the sensor that detects a full basket has malfunctioned. It continuously senses a full basket and shuts itself down. Best to look elsewhere for a better shredder."
1,fellowes DM15c,I bought this shredder in July 2007 and it's now Feb 2008 and it worked well in the beginning and as another reviewer stated the control light that tells you the basket is full kept coming on continuously and you had to open and close the door for it to continue working. Then it started to continually run and you had to turn it off and on as you used it and finally the other day it burst (if you can believe that) which scared me half to death might i add and i sat speechlessly staring at it in disbelief. For an item i started out really liking it turned out to be a piece of junk. Please look for another shredder to buy. NOT THIS ONE !!
3,I'd just like to gloat for a moment about this:,"I got my copy of ""The Stay Awake"" for under $10 and it's now going for $98 online? Good lord, that's obscene. This is an OK movie, but it's by no means worth that much money and anyone that spends that much for it is obviously more insane than the people pricing it that way. And now for the story, well, a bunch of girls in some school are stalked by some serial killer's ghost that inexplicably ended up in Europe after being executed in the US. Even though this is a South African movie. Go figure. And you WILL be fighting to stay awake at times, although for some reason I really did like this, sort of. Anyway it is DEFINITELY not worth any $98."
1,"Do Not Pass Go and Do NOT ""Stay Awake""","I LOVE the horror genre, the good ones, the ""bad"" ones, even the cheesey '80s ones. But this movie is just AWFUL. Let me say that again, this movie is just AWFUL. The ""plot"" is so thin and less than interesting, you barely even know any of the character's names so don't expect to feel anything when they get killed (actually, you might pray for them to get killed because: 1) the acting is beyond awful and 2) it would create some action on the screen, and lastly...the special effects are really not very special. I've seen scarrier plug in animatronic Christmas figures.Don't waste any time or money on this movie. The producers didn't."
5,What kind of mushroom cloud is that on the cover?,"A quintissential album from the psychedelic warriors of Jefferson Airplane. In many ways the perfect album for the band with exquisite songs, lyrics and music and playing with harmonies and matching guitars, the powerhouse rhythm section, the challenging positions adopted by the band and an almost understement of production.I love the whole thing. A must for every collection and an album which still sounds good and fresh today. So do the songs, at least the ones that the latest incarnation played at BB Kings in New York last Friday.Support your local Jeffesron Starship, America's band soon to belong to the Universe."
3,"It isn't,",as a friend of mine noted years ago. Look to Surrealistic Pillow for the crown of Jefferson Airplane's creation.
3,Doesn't Hold Up In the 2000's,"I start out by saying I was a huge Jefferson Airplane fan and saw them live twice. One of the better Bay Area's bands, and one of the best live shows ever.Regretably, this album does not hold up well to modern standards. ""Lather"" is a wierd drug induced anti-war child becomes man theme without a melody or discernable beat. ""Triad"" is a nice song, better sampled by the Byrds in one of their outtake CD's currently available.""If You Feel"" is a nice Marty Balin song, which is throwback to the 1st two Jefferson Airplane albums, and a precursor to his excellent singing and songwriting career.""Greasy Heart"" is an excellent example of Grace Slick and Paul Kanter singing duets.Other than these two tracks, which are five star songs, the album simply doesn't translate well into this milenium."
4,Why buy this re-re-re-release,"I'll leave the critical reviews to those who made their opinions known under the prior release of this CD. Suffice to say this is a very good, underrated album in the JA/JS canon. The query here is ""Why should I buy this CD""? Simply put, the remastered 24 bit sound is ASTOUNDING. The interplay between Casady/Kaukonen/Dryden is now revealed with a clarity that finally makes a definitive case for the trio being the premier musicians of the SF rock scene. The muddiness of the prior releases, even the problems with the mid 90's ""remasters"", is almost completly removed, with only the slightest tape hiss to distract you during some of the quieter sections. Thankfully, the vocals of Slick/Balin and Kantner are also revealed in all their glory, leaving no doubt as to the quality that needs to be re-discovered about JA. If you have a high-end stereo system this release is a must buy, and not a bad bargain those who don't."
5,Airplane's best album,"Crown of Creation, I feel, is Jefferson Airplane's most accomplished, solid album. The songwriting and music is wonderful all around and the whole group contributes to the overall brilliance of the album. Crown of Creation is a timeless album, not locked into a specific era like some of Airplane's work. Several of my favorite JA songs are found here, including the wonderful, folksy opener, Lather. This great album is a must for any classic rock lover."
1,Missing Pages,"The book is missing pages... 3-16. The book also is hard to read because its pages seemed like it was photo copied and then placed in a ""new"" book. The book is junk."
1,Where's the rest?,"This was very poorly published! It's missing pages 12-15. And the Foreword and Author's Preface are illegible, due to poor reprint. This review is before I even got past the first few pages!"
1,"Excellent service, New book, some letters not legible some pages missing.",The service was excellent but the book was not printed properly. It was a brand new book. The book was never opened but some of the letters were not legible and some of the pages were never included in the book right from the publisher.
4,Large Print It's Not,"The Word of God is priceless; and this bible is lovely (in burgundy leather)and lightweight. That said, I was very disappointed in the size of the type. I have seen ""large print"" typeface in other Bibles, and this is not it."
4,Great Price but Very Reflective Glass,The monitor came very fast: 2 days. It looks good but the very flat glass reflects any natural light.
1,pages missing from book!,"The content of The Virtual is quite interesting, Shields does a nice job historicizing the terms and contributing to the debates on the implications of a shifting relationship between the virtually real and the material. HOWEVER, a huge problem if you're interested in this book for research: the last 30 pages were not bound in the new copy of this book that I ordered through Amazon. No notes to chapters 3 through 9, no bibliography, and no index. In that respect, it's just not useful."
2,I prefer a different brand,"A Taste of Thai's Yellow Curry Rice is spicier than I like.Therefore, I much prefer Thai Kitchen's Yellow Curry Rice.Thai Kitchen's boxes, when purchased in bulk, also cost less.I use these rice mixes to create a lovely casserole.After the curry rice is cooked i mix in one can of tuna and some peas.You could add other mild flavored veggies to the dish depending on what you like.You could then crisp the top of the casserole in the oven or you could serve it right out of the pan ;-)Overall, I will not be buying this item again.But I will be purchasing Thai Kitchen's version."
2,Not what we thought,"We were disappointed with this product. We have KIds in the Kitchen by the same group and it is excellent. This one has only instrumental songs. The titles seemed to suggest otherwise. It is good instrumental, but not what we expected."
2,very fragile (the description says 'HOME or salon use'),"I have no direct experience of 'salon' or 'pedicure', so maybe mine is a misuse:I bought those to give them to my guests when they come at home. At first they fit well and the colors are nice, but I was expecting them to last at least a couple of hours of moderate walking around the house, while half of them broke in around two minutes, in some cases even before putting them on.They are not suitable to be put on with socks, but this is visible from pictures, so my main concern is the durability, they are probably good if you don't have to walk, but in that case, why do you need slippers?I admit they are very cheap, but I wouldn't mind to pay something more for a more resistant product."
2,too lightweight even for kids,"bought these for a spa party for eight year old girls.. Way too thin... One girl went through 4 pairs in the three hours, straps kept bursting. Shipping time was great... But the product itself is flawed. This is one instance where the price was too good to be true."
5,"Finz, the greatest law professor I know","There is NO better source for law concepts than Finz. Dr. Finz is the single best source for all law concepts, especially Tort. I've listened to authors and read other authors; some are bad, some are ok, some are quite good. But nobody comes close to Finz in terms of completeness, accessibility, and clarity. My friends, you can't go wrong with Dr. Finz."
5,Great source for mutistate bar exam practice questions,"I used the Finz book to prepare myself for the California First Year Law Students' Exam (FYLSX, commonly known as the 'baby bar') and benefited much! I scored an 89% on the MBE portion of the test, which gave me an A on the exam. While I only used the book last year for Torts, Contracts, and Criminal law, Finz Multistate Method includes questions on Property, Constitutional Law, and Professional Responsibility for the bar candidate. Steve has some great tips for approaching MBE questions, and writes in an entertaining and logical manner. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Print on Demand Issue,"The description does not tell you this is a print on demand issue. This is not printed like the original on glossy paper highlighting the beautiful images. The pictures are all on flat paper as if you printed your photos on your home computer.While the technical aspects of the book are perfectly acceptable, the artistic aspects are totally lost. Huge disappointment."
5,The Best Pooh Ever!,"This version of Winnie the Pooh, with its amazing puppets, beautifully rendered Hundred Acre Wood, and stories that are funny, heartfelt and pay homage to A.A. Milne is a wonder!"
4,Great for Young Pooh Fans,"I read the other reviews of this video before purchasing, and was a little worried by the negative ones. However, I think most young children will have no objections. My five-year-old son enjoys the original Pooh movies (like The Blustery Day), the lower-quality TV series videos, and the newer ones. He thinks this one is great. (I wonder if this is analogous to Star Trek: We older Original Series fans just can't get into the newer incarnations, whereas others enjoy them all.)The animation was a little funny-looking: Pooh has too much of a neck, for one thing. The music and the stories were pretty good. Young Pooh fans will love it.I think, for overall quality, the original Pooh movies and ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" are superior. (I'd actually recommend ""Pooh's Grand Adventure,"" over ""The Book of Pooh."" Even though it's not A. A. Milne either, the music, artwork, and writing are truly first-rate.)"
3,"Not very climatic, not for younger children.","No singing and dancing, mostly talking and story telling with the narrator having a harsh British accent. I bought this for my 18 month old but she doesn't find any interest in it. Maybe she'll enjoy it later. For her age group I recommend Barney, because there is alot of singing and changing of pace. Pooh is too anticlimatic. Elmo is too slow as well.Good luck. Hope this helps."
1,NOT FOR KANGA AND ROO FANS!,When they made this show I'm sad to say Kanga and Roo were left out. How Disappointing! It's not Fair!
4,Pooh Bear Has Found Another Friend,I had ordered this product for my grandson's birthday. He is just beginning to enjoy Winnie the Pooh and LOVES the story-like videos. He also enjoys acting out the story with a stuffed bear.
1,Avoid this Pooh movie!,"My 18 mo. daughter and I watch lots of Pooh movies (more than 12 now) and this one is the worst by far. The animation is annoying and cheesy and did not hold her interest at all like the other Pooh films. Piglet's Big Movie, The Tigger Movie, Adventures of Winnie the Pooh are her favorites. Very Merry Pooh Year is a good one as well."
1,A pile of Pooh,"What a step back in quality! Disney seemed to have moved on from insulting DVD releases when a picture printed on the DVD disc face was classed as an `extra'. The delights that the Snow White DVD will bring this October is what we expect - but this Pooh release is shoddy, unimaginative and a blur of pastel-coloured pixels and cheap blue screening a la 1980. Absolute rubbish. Has all the lustre of a pair of old saggy y-fronts!"
2,Better spend money on The Tigger Movie.,"I bought The Book of Pooh DVD for my 2 yr. old son anticipating refreshing animation and story line. Unfortunately I was very disappointed, the story moves slower than molasses. After 10 minutes, my son demanded that I replace it with The Tigger Movie DVD. The computer generated background is so blurry and must have been drawn by an 8 yr old. Watching it on my Sony WEGA 36"" I get dizzy from the detailed puppets against blurry scrolling background, which is very pixelated and flat. My recommendation, spend your money on good old hand draw Pooh."
3,The Book of Pooh movie,Was a little disappointed in the movie. Content was not up to the standard I've become used to in Disney movies. Old fashioned art work. Would not recommend.
1,Disappointing,We were very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend this if you are anticipating the quality of the fully animated versions.
2,Not even worth the 5 dollars !,"If you think this is the re-release of the original Ike & Tina album ""come Together"" (liberty records), than you're wrong ! This is a budget compilation of laserlight and contains (only) ten tracks. The album contains some songs of the sixties and seventies but does not even deserve the name ""compilation"". Even when the price is only about 5 dollars, it's not worth the money !"
2,Peace and Charity,"I am the reviewer from Sacramento.I was a little distressed when I read my review sparked their interest: She agreed with its right wing Christian viewpoint. I am also a devout Christian who reads the Bible with ""Heart and Mind"" to quote Peter Gomes. God loves all of her children. I felt like my review was used to give aid and comfort to the enemy. I hope another progressive writer will take the theme and show Jesus' and humanity's real enemies: racism, classicsm, poverty, meanspirited, and homophobia. May the Peace of the Lord be always with you!"
2,Ugh!!!,"Okay, this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen. And thank goodness it wasn't feature length (only 70 minutes). But I sat there looking at my watch counting down the moments until the ending credits.Funny? I think I laughed about three times. I laughed enough to award it an extra star. You'll laugh more actually watching most Mormon Cinema. But they were trying so (too?) hard to be funny... it just didn't catch.Different? Oh, yeah!!!Interesting? Not really.Worth the time to watch? I would say (in fact yell) no. It is rather pointless and a waste of 70 minutes of my life.Recommended? Well, I actually used to make movies in high school and I'm LDS (a mormon) so this should have been right up my alley. If you are neither or one of these two then I would say no. If you are both of these, then maybe. But I wish I never rented this."
3,Ok,"I have average sized ear canals, but these were a little too big. I still use them sometimes. I use them to sleep, but the Mack's brand is way more comfey and fit better for me."
1,not working for my needs,these might stop water but they dont stop a lot of sound.. bought these to help with sleep at night... but can hear a lot of sounds while wearing these.
2,sugary sweet -- but not Venezuelan,"This is a Euro-classically trained harpist arranging folk melodies and other pieces in a soft, oh so gorgeous interpretation of her liking. That's fine, and it is very pretty.Now, if you are interested in Venezuelan music, including a Venezuelan sensitivity to Euro-classical repertoire, skip this completely. And, needless to say, these recordings pale in comparison to Venezuealan players and the depth and power they can bring to music on the harp."
5,"Hey, it's Hank Thompson",Hank does the great Cindy Walker song 'Bubbles in My Beer' on this disc. I think it's the only time he recorded it. A little different take than the Bob Wills/Tommy Duncan version. A lot of other great songs but this one alone makes buying the disc worthwhile.
1,It is the work of a con artist,"Practically every knighthood recommended is self-style, that is, fake. None are listed with the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry, because they are are illegitimate or phoney. This book was written to enrich the coffers of a scammer and is full of misrepresentations and falsehoods. The real author, not the one written on the book, is being investigated by the FBI. Their file on him is at least 800 pages long. I know because I was one of his victims. This book is not worth the paper it is printed on."
5,video of hope for our youth!!!,"I don't go to the movies very often. However a friend recommended this after it had been released for sale. We purchased it, we laughed and we cried throughout the movie. It is excellent, especially for jr. high, high school and college aged kids. It has a great message. It is tastefully done and has great actors and actresses. ""What is the point of it all, if you don't let it change you"" The point of all life. Great movie!!!"
5,To save a life,This was very inspiring and amazing to watch. To change the life of one person can encourage one to do so. Beautifully done.
5,Great movie with great lessons!,This movie has many wonderful lessons for all ages and the acting and storyline is well-developed and great especially for a lower-budget Christian film.
5,To Save a LIfe,"This movie was awesome. I highly recommend it, especially those teenagers who are having a tough time finding their place in the world."
1,Yay for superstition.,"If you enjoy simplistic pseudo miracle superstitious fluff, then this movie was made for you."
4,Good message,"A good movie with a good message. It has a good word for young people, clean movie for all ages."
5,wonderful lesson for the whole family,bought this when my 14 year old grandaughter was coming to visit. it was excellent and she took it home to share with friends.
2,Could have been a great movie,"My 20yr old daughter and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it. However we were shocked at the bedroom scene. You see them naked as a silhouette. The dancing at the party was really sensual, and the supporting actress was dressed very skimpily throughout the movie. There was also mild cussing. I wish I could have let my other kids watch it, but no way! The bedroom scene was especially disturbing."
4,Powerful movie! Must SEE for TEENAGERS,"What a powerful movie for young people to see. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't approve of the cussing, sexual scenes, alcohol, and drug references in the movie. However, having said that I feel like our young people need to see how their choices effect other people. A movie like this is a good depiction of the realities that face our young people today and how they can take a stand against their peers and truly make a difference...and even more importantly SAVE A LIFE!"
5,Great Movie,"This movie was Awsome. It showed all the aspects of High School, Drinking, Partying, Girlfriends,Pregnacy,and Being the ""Popular one."" It shows everyne what teens are getting into, and how the Lord can help you get out of them. This moive is great for anyone. Someone who wants to better their walk with Christ,someone who just wants to know what teens are doing and how to help them,or someone who is going through many of the problems/issues Jake is going through. This is a great outreach film, and I recommend that everyone should see this movie. Everyone is affect by it one way oranother/"
5,Perfect For a Youth Group Movie Night,"This movie was great for our youth group movie night. It was convicting and thoughtprovoking. It made you stop and think, how will I respond the next time I see a person being excluded or bullied? The movie depicted the life of a teenager right ontarget."
4,Worth veiwing & owning,"While this movie could still be classified among B-movies or ""made for TV"" movies, it's a huge step in the right direction for the Christian/church based movie production industry. The story is fairly well-written, the acting is much better than early church-produced movie attempts & the soundtrack is really good. Most importantly, the story doesn't gloss over the struggles in life, but focuses on the strength that God provides His children to overcome the difficult consequences of our stupid decisions & the imperfections in our lives & the lives of those around us."
5,Love this kind of movies!!!,It was a good movie for school. Great morals are displayed in this movies and kids need to see that it pays to do what is right.
5,A must see,Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. It's long but well worth the time. A must see for any teen or anybody for that fact.
5,Save a Life,My order was expedited in a very timely fashion with proper packaging! I would definitely order again!
5,Great movie that all teens should see,I took my niece to see the movie. I was moved greatly but the story line but not as much as she was. I had no idea until after she seen the movie that she had considered suicide. This movie is a must see for all teens.
5,A must see movie!,"To Save a Life is amazing. The content is strong and does not shy away from difficult issues - making it a realistic and thought provoking movie. The story was well told, the characters are very believable and it had a realistic ending. Thankfully, it felt like a real (well made)movie with a christian message - not a christian movie trying to be mainstream. I would caution viewers to be aware of the topics covered (drinking, unmarried/underage sex, cutting, suicide, divorse) prior to viewing as it can be a bit overwhelming."
5,Inspiring!!,"An amazing movie with an amazing plot that shows values and morals that we do not see in the world much today! This movie WILL inspire you to want to make a change, whether it is at a high school, college or your work place. If you buy this movie you will not regret it!"
5,Worthy of Song,"Worth every single penny,dollar and the waiting period.Truly can't ask for anything else with this CD Soundtrack.Not one negative i can think of,say or type down with FF8 OST.Feels pretty grand playing other video games while listening to Ultimecia's Castle,Mod de Chocobo,Estar,The Spy and Succession of Witches.Now,I need to get FF10 OST and Kingdom Hearts 2 OST and i am done."
2,Not the easy off cap.,"I purchased this chicken so my son could take it in his lunch. The picture of the item shows the pull tab, easy off cap. But when the item arrived, it was a traditional can needing a can opener. Same product on the inside, but very disappointed in the packaging."
3,Changing Times...,"...This is a ''Subscribe & Save'' item for us. In the beginning this was Always a 5 star item. Now as the liquid content increases and the chicken decreases it's now a 3. Also, the price has increased by almost $4.00. It appears the cost of water is on the increase."
5,JD Robb-Betrayal in Death,"This book is once again..Robb at her best! I absolutely love Eve's character! She is my favorite of all the fiction characters I've ever read about! Strong..Idependent...She brings justice to all of her victims no matter what the consequence. I can't say it's my favorite JD Robb, but that's only because they're ALL my favorite..but i will say this is a MUST read..it's amazing..as all of them are;) I def. give it a 10!"
2,Too Much,"I have enjoyed one or two of the books from this series and had been anticipating this one. It never grabbed me. The murder at the beginning was much too graphic. Then getting into the mind of such a sadistic killer was more than I want from a book. I read for relaxation and entertainment, not to be reminded of the depravity in the world. The tension and competition between Eve and Roarke is getting tiresome. I have to admit that I didn't finish this book and maybe it improved. I preferred to toss it and go on to something else. Time is too precious. Take a look at Barbara Parker's series."
4,A great installment,"The 12th installment of the IN DEATH series delivers!Eve Dallas tackles her greatest challenge to date when it is discovered that the murderer she's chasing has targeted none other than her husband, Roarke. She must balance heart and head, managing to keep both in check, if this murderous rampage is to be stopped before her husband falls victim.The suspense is perfectly-written. It feels very natural. It feels very real and lifelike. Occasionally, writers grow stale and their stories lose something. In this installment, Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) has not lost a step! I loved this book."
3,Betrayal in Death,"This was my first J.D. Robb book and I am here to tell you that I wasn't all that impressed by it. Maybe this story just wasn't for me. I am going to read another one of her books just for the benefit of the doubt. I did like her main character, Eve. She is a hard nosed, strong willed woman and I admire and respect that. I think that was the only reason I had any desire to finish the book. From reading her recent book reviews, I know that she is a talented author and this may be one of the lower ends of her spectrum in writing."
3,Warning - SPOILER ALERT,"I really enjoy the In Death series, so I was surprised when the conclusion of this one left a bad taste. The story was engrossing because we already know who the killer is right from the beginning, and therefore the story was more focused on the investigation as Eve pieced together how to get him. However, I can't explain why the book disappointed me without spoiling......SPOILER: I enjoy the satisfaction that comes when Eve catches the killer and he/she gets what they deserve. So, I felt cheated when the killer offed himself in the end to avoid jail. Considering how he killed his victims, it seemed wrong that he got off so easy. Some might say, that's realistic. But, come on, these books aren't realistic--Eve solves every case! Unfortunately, this isn't the first one of these novels to end this way, nor is it likely to be the last. I'm hopeful it remains a rarity, though. Recommended to fans of the series who just have to read every book, but I wish I had skipped this one."
2,A bit disappointed-- with spoilers,"I really love her books, and the characters in this series are wonderful. So don't get me wrong, I'm usually a big fan of this series. But. . . the ending was a big let down. The bad guy was horrible. Really deserved to get it big time. And then when he was caught so easily in the end, I thought, oh no! Just wait, he'll get away and come back after Eve and Roarke and all hell is going to break loose! But no. He was just caught. The end. And the whole story thread with Roarke being his target was completely dropped. I thought that Roarke would tear him apart when he tried for him. Or Eve would. But Eve and Roarke never even knew that he was a target. And Dr. Mira's grand-child. I thought that Eve would have some sort of thoughts about children in regard to herself. Even if the thoughts were ""no flippin way!"" But it was never mentioned again. I was pretty disappointed over all."
4,always a good read,"These books are not intellectual or enlightened, but ALWAYS entertaining! Great series overall - I recommend as beach books to all my friends."
1,Story ruined by Fact Check Big Miss,"I was enjoying my first JD Robb when this horrible factual error showed up and kept beingn repeated. This must have driven any British fans bonkers. Fact Cornwall is the Southern most County in England. Fact residents ie. detectives would not speak with a ""Broad Northern Accent"" unless they put in for transfer. This obvious error is a horrible distraction and I hope that it isn't true of all JD Robb books or this will be first and last."
5,Another page turner,"As usual, Robb follows her characters lives well. I like the way I can continue with their lives one book after another."
4,Haunting Poetry,"I first encountered one of Sylvia Plath's poems in my English course at college. I became engaged and decided to buy this book. I wasn't dissapointed. Although I don't like all of the poems, there are some that are really haunting. She always put forth what she though, which is really admirable. They are easy to read. My favorites are:""Daddy"" and ""Lady Lazarus""."
5,Totally Awesome a must have,"So dark yet beautiful, a must have for every women. I was left speechless with it's intensity and shocked by the passion.I ordered Ted Hughes, Birthday Letters, at the same time and read it after reading Ariel. Then I started reading them together one of his and then one of hers. I was moved to tears and spent an evening in near exhaustation, I'm left speechless.Call me silly, but I can't help but see a very tragic modern day Romeo and Juliet with these two books. The expression of pain, hurt and love in these two poets is beyond comparsion and seldom seen. They touched the soul and will be remembered.Thank you Sylvia and Thank you Ted."
5,Calling all women,"Every woman should adore Sylvia Plath - she is intuitively the voice of our female sex, this book, including the lovely introduction by her daughter Frieda, is beautiful."
3,"Sorry, Sylvia","There is a poet, now gone, whom academe reckons great. You might do the same here and there in her work, but certainly not everywhere. In fact, some of her poetry seems a bit overblown to you.You ask yourself, what is wrong with my preferences? The grand art buffos say Sylvia is a giant and you disagree. Stick to your guns! The buffos might be wrong and you might be the discerning one. It's a matter of communication between you and the artist, not you and the buffos.Art, piece by piece, bit by bit, is a subjective matter, a communication, and you alone must decide if you like or dislike an artist's creations.--- Joe Psarto"
4,"Not the Little Mermaid, please...don't do that.","This is the much heralded Plath collection that everyone should read if you're into poetry, Plath, or heck, even good work. At a time of internal angst and turmoil, Mrs. Hughes cranked this out in a distinct voice and the greatest poems of her work are here: Lady Lazarus, Daddy, etc etc...It's a genuine treasure of poetry. If you can, get the voice recordings of Sylvia reading her own work. She has a soulful, determined, almost English (huh, wonder WHERE she got that from) intonation that makes you want to kiss her red mouth (that she was known for) and bless her for this beautiful, painful, stubbornly gorgeous poetry. Bravo, Plath!"
1,"Highly breakable, confusing P.O.S.","We bought this for our 12-year old in December 2005 and just threw it out after taking 0 acceptable photos with it. We already have 2 other digital cameras in the house and have used them extensively for two years so this was not a user problem.1. 2 crucial buttons fell off in one month. We used a paper clip instead.2. All photos we've taken have been orange-cast, dark, and blurry.3. The on-off switch is malfunctioning. It's almost impossible to turn the camera off, which means the batteries run down quickly.4. The user manual has no information on how to correct image problems. We have yet to find any on-line help.5. Buttons on the camera are tiny and hard to use. Button functions are extremely difficult to figure out unless you have the manual on your knee. Not an intuitive design at all.We had high hopes for this camera and bought it because of a few good reviews and the camera's sleek design.Don't waste your money on this."
1,Horrible,"Don't buy this. I saved up for it during my freshman year of college because I really wanted a camera and I was so disapointed when I received this. I recently gave it to my 8 year old brother to play with. Its too crappy to pawn off to someone on ebay. Dont waste your money. Eats batteries before you can even take a picture and the flash feature is terrible, along with the quality of the pictures."
2,Not worth it!,"It's cheap, but that's where the positives end. Very poor picture quality just makes the size meaningless. Yeah, it's very small and lightweight, but the idea of a camera is to take pictures...and in several different conditions, the pics we took with this camera were grainy. No matter ho wmuch light we had, still grainy. Very disappointing. I used it for a while, then sold it!"
1,Total Junk Camera,"I bought this to take pictures of household construction work, Torture to work the tiny joystick button. Kills your batteries after about 3-4 flashes, pictures are of poor quality on any setting, distance and or set up once you figure out how to work the buttons. I read some reviews on this that stated this was a poor camera, but I figured for what I was going to use it for why not. Wrong choice, DO NOT waste a single penny on this item, if someone try's to give you one for free, they do not like you. How a product this bad actually made it into production is ridiculous. Just to rehash ""DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA"" it is total garbage."
3,"Could have been a fantastic 7""","Holyname, Slave, Liar and Idefy would have made a fantastic 7"". The tracks altogether are a nice picture of the scene at the time, but even then it felt a bit hit or miss.Hey there for those curious on how the tracks break down: Holyname 0:00, Grow 2:01, Hopeless 3:52, Gopinatha 5:48, 10.8 7:05, Thirst 8:15, Slave 11:04, Liar 12:50, Idefy 13:51, Tulasi's Song 16:42"
2,Sometimes it's not what you remember,"I saw this when I was in grade school and really enjoyed it. I had not seen it since. What little I remembered about it was wrong. Usually I really, really enjoy the old Sci-Fi/Fantasy & Horror flicks from my childhood. This one, not so much. Even the fact that George Pal was involved did not help it....for me at least.For nostalgia's sake it is OK, otherwise no."
3,Good Quality,Arrived in GREAT condition & the movie was good to see again after not seeing it since 1961 when I was 9 years old!!!
5,Memories.,"This film about Alantis, is a woderful story. If this place ever did exist, at least in Hollywood, it must have been a terrific place to live."
2,Not a true anamorphic!,"Buyers beware. Although the movie is presented in a 1:85 anamorphic format, the movie company actually achieved this dubious enhancement by cutting the top and bottom of the original 4:3 format! I would have preferred the ""fullscreen"" presentation. Rather than ditching my VHS copy, I have kept it as the preferred copy. For shame, MGM!"
2,George Pal's worst SF film.,"Some of the fantasy and SF films produced by the late George Pal in the 50s and 60s hold up well, but this one sure doesn't. It probably ranks as his worst film. The basic story (a young Greek fisherman visits the legendary Atlantis shortly before it sinks) has potential, but the movie itself is dismal. The ""house of fear"", in which humans are turned into semi-animal slaves, is an obvious rip-off of THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, with the gimmick reversed, and the ""monsters"" are merely humans with animal heads. The climactic sinking consists mostly of stock footage from QUO VADIS. For the most part, just barely passable Saturday afternoon fun."
1,I Want My Wide Screen,"This is a wounderful movie and still holds up after all these years. Why one star? Well it isnt the movie, its fantastic!....Alot of people complain about the Special Effects. ....It dosent need any. The origional movie was filmed in ""Super Panivision ""more like: 2:35:1 aspect ratio, and has been reduced to 1:33 VHS. watching this version, will at best give you a headace. Can you imagine driving thru the Red Woods wearing horse blinders, your view would be drastically altered. The special effects are the Splendor, Grandios, and giant set pieces. When I saw this on VHS I got dizzy from all the Pan and scan needed to reduce it to VHS size. Most of the best set pieces are seriouslly cropped, and the destruction seen, is reduced to a mild storm. You are only seeing about 1/4 of the action, and magnificent sets that cover the entire screen. 1 star for the VHS release, but 5 stars for the movie..... Let us pray to the DVD Gods to give this movie the release it so deservedlly needs!"
3,Another Great Matinee Fantasy,"Anyone that enjoys the older fantasy films like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" or the old Hercules movies should enjoy this movie. It is a well made adventure with the lost city of Atlantis, a fish shaped submarine, mutated animal men, a giant, a crystal ray gun, and beautiful women. What more could you ask for a great Saturday afternoon matinee. Sure it may not be as entertaining to adults as it once was but the kids will certainly love it. The whole family can watch this one. This is at least a couple notches above the B movies. I am surprised this isn't out on DVD since I am sure it would sell. I can't beleive I am the only one that would buy it."
1,Erroneous information and stigmatizing . . . terrible!,"This recently-produced but woefully outdated video titled ""Understanding Mental Illness"" contains information and classifications of mental illness that pre-date the DSM-III. One of the most glaring examples of an erroneous description/classification is it's listing of schizophrenia as a ""Personality Disorder."" What's worse, really bad actors bulge their eyes and display stereotypical (often violent or menacing) behaviors during poorly-produced vignettes. For example, a woman trembles with ""fear"" as a rubber spider is pulled across a blanket as she lies in bed. I've seen more realistic scenes (and better actors) in 1950s era 3-D movies! This video/DVD is worse than most of the old 16mm health education films that I suffered through as a high school student in the 1960s. I would have rated this video/DVD as a ""Zero-Star"" if it was an available option."
2,A pale reflection of a dry revisal,"The original scoring and orchestrations of the original 1982 production were so lush, so full, so resonant. The scaled back pit is the first thing you notice. The next is that any sense of joy or humor has been stripped out of the show by the removal of certain characters and their songs. The ultimate problem is that in the actual revised production nothing has really been added to compensate for these reductions. The recording suffers even more from the lack of any visuals that occassionally distracted from the production's shortcomings. My recommendation is to purchase the new recently released 2 cd set of the expanded Original Cast Recording instead."
5,sublime,"If you've had the pleasure of seeing the new production of Nine on Broadway, as I have, then this CD will bring back marvelous memories. And if you haven't seen the revival, this CD will tell you what all the hype is about. It's as sumptuous, as entertaining, and as moving as the production itself. And the cast actually sounds better on the CD than in the theatre; Banderas's ""Only With You,"" Masterson's ""My Husband Makes Movies,"" and Benanti's ""Unusual Way,"" to name just three, are superb. I have all the recordings of Nine. You can argue all you want about the merits of each cast, but this recording seemed to me crafted with the most caring hands."
3,"Solid, Yet Oddly Clinical and Forced","It's near impossible not to fall in love with some of the songs in Nine, and the 1998 revival is technically proficient and for the mostpart, satisfying. Banderas and Rivera are terrific. Yet there's something oddly detached and over-dramatised about this recording. Certain cast members seem more focused on rounding out their Italian accents than communicating the heart of the material. This is particularly noticeable on two of the show's best known songs, My Husband Makes Movies and Unusual Way. These should be showstoppers, but here, seem almost... quaint.It's hardly a dealbreaker, but it might be enough to make you reach more frequently for the 1982 recording."
1,This is not NINE,"Nine is a beautiful show... one of the most amazing shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I did not see the revival, and this recording does not in anyway make me wish I had. Antonio's performance is extremely flat. It all seems so calculated and rehearsed, which is not at all Guido's character. Guido Contini is charming, smooth, and a con-artist in many ways. Antonio missed that completely. I saw his performance on the Tony Awards show, and it made me want to cry. There was none of the character I loved so much there.The other performances were, for the most part, ok to good. None surpassingly great, except Chita Rivera, who, sadly, does not have enough to do to save the show.Get the original!"
2,The samples on this page are from the original,"So I went to listen to some samples of the CD on Amazon before I bought it, and lo and behold, Amazon cheated a little and put the original Broadway cast album up for samples, not the revival. That is definitely Raul Julia singing, not Antonio Banderas. Amazon- get it together!"
4,In the 60's groove,"An enjoyable package of music. Has the Vibe of the 1960'S ,1970's counterculture movement but, a bit toward the pop. Still cool though!"
1,Poorly made,"I bought 5 sets of bars. 3 of them were ok but 2 of them were made differently even though all the model number are the same. My best guess is that they ran out of the brackets from the un-hinged side and started welding the brackets from the hinged side on. This made it impossible to install the bars level and still be able to open them.On all of them, the hardware is garbage. The screws bend and screw heads brake off even though I pre-drilled the holes.Last they are just not built well. The welding is poor and the paint is not applied evenly. This might sound trivial but the paint gobs keep the sliding parts and hinges from moving freely."
1,Adrift,"Jon's life is full of detachment (many one-night stands, lots of drugs and partying), and suddenly, almost inexplicably he has a change of heart. He stops all his bad behavior and changes his life for the better. This forced plot development isn't entirely fleshed out enough for the reader to believe in it. The many editorial errors and preachy rhetoric detract from the potential of the story. I wanted to like the book, but overall it's just a skeletal, vapid, yet hopeful story."
2,commendable,"For a first effort this was commendable. There is now more and more literature targeted toward the african-american gay male being publishedMy only problem is with the editing.This is the second book I have read from this publishing group and I am sorry to say that the editing is poor. The grammatical structure is weak and the are blatant mistakes in the story line. Example on page one, Jon's car is a different color than on page two.It is great that this product is avaiable on the mass market but the quality must be kept high. The syntax errors began to distract me from the reading and they are numerous.However for story quality, it was a good 'soap opera' story"
2,"Mixes, not radio version","Just beware that this is not a 'normal' single, it's a single with a lot of mixes of the song. I didn't realise that at the time of purchase, d'oh!"
1,101 ways to loose money,"This book jumped around from mostly different careers, such as: making bird houses(start up costs $1000-2000), sewing quilts (start up $1-500), specialty dress maker (start up $500), chimney sweep (start up $1000), computer tutoring (start up $1500-2500),technical writing (start up $1000-2500), telephone answering service (start up $1500-3000), developmental editing (start up $1500-2500), and computer programming ($2500-6000). All of these ideas and most of the others in the book, seem to be more like careers and not ways to earn extra cash from the garage of your home. All of these take education or practical experience and know how and most require a substantial start up cost. I do not recommend buying this book, but instead looking in the want ads of your local newspaper for something in which you are qualified."
1,One reviewer put in three reviews to drive the score up for this book!,"this book had one negative review, then this other reviewer put in three reviews in one day, all rating this book with 5 stars and two virtually word for word, don't be fooled!"
5,Spy Devices of the Cold War,"CIA Special Weapons & Equipment: Spy Devices of the Cold War by H. Keith Melton is worth buying. Seller shipped quickly, as agreed."
5,"Esp for anyone who has lost a parent when they were young,","Knowing that I had lost my father in an accident when I was 8 my friend recommended the book to me. The author sadly really did lose her father when she was 12.I could identify with so much -- I felt the writing was excellent.I also really, really liked her book called ""Sailing"". It was constructed and written so very well. I wanted to see if the author has since written any more books and was sorry to see this book out of print."
5,Six Interconnected Stories About a Father's Death,"This might be the finest book I read during the 1980's. It is a collection of six interconnected short stories that Ms. Kenney calls a novel. The chapters examine the memories and perceptions invoked by different circumstances and times in the protagonist's life. They all center on her father's death at an early age and the concepts of desertion and trust. They examine her mother's madness and her husband's illness and how death does not necessarily end life. Real life may well exist in one's memories.This book is so good that I can recall it now, 24 years after I read it, almost as well as if I had just finished it. The book is that good."
5,one of my favorite books,This book was very moving. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time. The main charactor is easy to empathize with and the writing is superb. I wish it wasn't out of print because it is such an enjoyable book.
3,Better to be had,"I've got quite a collection of MST3k discs now and I must say this collection as a whole isn't one of my favs. Teenagers is a decent watch and there are some memorable moments during the shorts, although there is also some overlap in play here.It may be safe to say that fans of Joel may appreciate this more than fans of Mike as I believe Mike only makes a limited appearance during a few shorts. That said, I don't think these are Joel's strongest episodes and if you're looking to get into MST3K, you may want to put this volume down on your list a bit."
2,Ken Clark In a Bathing Suit,"If you put aside the mild camp appeal of the movie's premise -- that a giant leech is feeding on the local inhabitants, then kidnaps Yvette Vickers in a pair of short shorts -- the only reason to own this movie is for its long takes of Ken Clark wearing only a pair of swim trunks and a stern expression. I don't mean to suggest that isn't reason enough: it made me happy.This movie's a real treat, but it's not to everyone's taste."
3,SOMETHING TO WATCH,"SOMETHING TO WATCH, I WATCHED ABOUT HALF, AND WHEN I HAVE TIME, WILL WATCH THE OTHERS, SHOT NOT ON A CHEAP BUDGET, OK CAMERA, AND AVERAGE SIMPLE PLOT!"
2,terrible,"yes these movies are cheap in more ways than one. none of them have any kind of plot whatsoever. they are r rated and have a little nudity in them if thats what your looking for you might like them, but to me they made no sense at all."
3,more cheesey than you remember,"While several stories are coherient most are just total cheese.The transfers are very good I thought.All in all, unless the price is very right, you may want to pass on this."
1,worthless,"The movies, what I could see of them, were OK. This disks were unplayable on both of my players. Two played OK, two more with missing sections and 4 were completely inaccessible."
2,Pretty Bad,"I bought this for its low price and wanted to find out what 70's movies were like. Other than some nudity scenes, there is really nothing good about these movies."
3,wow the 70s were messed up,"I was born in 1966 and loved to go the drive-in with my family. Saw a lot of movies that most 10-14 year olds should not see. My favorite movie of all time is Alien, which was made in 1979 (30 years ago). Star Wars and One Flew Over the Cuckoos next were also 70s films. Seems like there was a huge disparity between the crap and the masterpieces. Watching these ""cult classics"" reminds me there is no such thing as a free lunch. Someone should be paying you to watch them. [...]. 2.5 hours of great entertainment versus 10 hours of drudgery watching these crappy DVDs."
4,Good sleaze,"This is a great collection of 70‘s sleaze. All movies were of good quality. If you are a collector or a novice, this is a good package.I like it. The nudity was just about right and the rape scenes ok."
3,review,Really classic movies that are what you would call B grade I guess. They were a lot of fun to see.
4,Great Odd Movies,Great Odd films from the 70's and great to watch on a Winter/Summer Day Stuff that was made and buried in the past LOL
2,Old time flicks,If you like the drive-in movies of the 60's and 70's with the show and flash of boobs then this is the movie for you!
1,Saggy boobs and bad acting is all you'll get for your money...,"I recently have become fascinated by exploitation films, so I decided this would be a sordid buy. I was surprised at how little the movies actually cost, considering there are eight in the set. But as I trudged through each one (fast-forwarding through the majority) I realized nothing worthwhile is cheap. These movies are campy and unbelievable. The story lines are non-existent and the sex scenes leave a lot to be desired...like sex. Malibu High was a cinematic trainwreck...the gratuitous nudity (which was not exactly pleasing or tasteful) was the only interesting thing about the ""cult classic"" The pimp in the movie looks like a weasel and the Lolita prostitute can't seem to find a client under 60. And everyone says this is the best one! I'd have spent more wisely on a Value Meal than this piece of junk."
3,A pack of silly juvenile teasers,Great stuff for when you've grown tired of all of your good movies ... light entertainment with a cruel twist ... just the thing as a backdrop with pop-corn when you've got something else to do.
2,Not worth the money saved,"As a fan of cheesy B horror movies, I thought that this would be a tremendous deal. Unfortunately, this set completely stinks. All of the titles are mundane and tedious....certainly not worth your time in watching. Do you wonder why the set is so cheap? Because the movies are garbage and the videos are such that no one wants to watch."
3,My favorite surprise in the set is...,"... in MALIBU HIGH:Throughout the film they've used the SCTV ""commercial break"" synthesizer cue. Unmistakable!"
5,Spectacular!...,"This 8-movie collection contains hippie chicks, bikers, a highschool gal turned hooker / assassin, infidelity, incest, savage hillbillies, drugs, booze, muscle cars, kidnapping, rape, murder, and enough nudity to fill a very happy battleship! Yes, DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS VOL. 1 is an exploitation-lovers dream-come-true! My favorites are TRIP WITH THE TEACHER, THE TEACHER, MALIBU HIGH (starts out dull, but ends up outrageously fun!), and CINDY AND DONNA. If you are a follower of all things 70s, sensational, cheap, and naked, then DICC will make you weep w/ joy..."
4,good value for money,"* films, most of these are eminently watchable, but not great films. Good B films that I missed while bringing up my children in the 70's. An excellent value for the money."
2,Okay Not Great,Interesting movies but not great. Acting is average to below average. Story line is fair. Video is okay. I find myself wanting to use the fast forward button in several situation due to the boring segments being shown. Probably great for drive in movies because everyone was making out and not watching the movie.
1,Don't do it,"The title says it all. Despite how much of a good deal the price seems, the movies are all terrible and very low quality. I wish I had my money back so I could buy a knife and stab myself in the face."
4,Takes me back!,"Old movies that took me back to the days of hiding in the trunk under sleeping bags to get into the drive-in for free. The only thing different is that this time I'm actually watching the movies. If you like old ""B"" movies this is a great value."
3,What a hoot.,These movies brought back memories of simpler times for me and a couple of them I actually saw at the drive-in. There are a lot of non-augmented breasts here.
5,Great buy/great service,This is a great little piece of art. I bought it for my daughter who loves cats and appreciates art.Delivery was timely and book was in excellent shape.
2,Worse then it looks.,"When using this, the phone sat nicely at my side, the top of the clip dug a bit into my skin. Also, if you are not careful and place the phone in the clip without being *sure* to press down, the phone may pop off as you change positions. I have lost my phone repeatedly from this."
3,"entertaining reading = 5, theoretical plausibility = 1","Although Bergler is a psychiatrist, he disagrees with Freud's explanation of male homosexuality. Bergler contends that a baby regards his mother as a witch who is trying to kill him. When the mother feeds the baby milk, the baby thinks she is trying to choke him. When the mother bathes the baby, the baby thinks she is trying to drown him. If a boy becomes fixated on this stage, homosexuality results.Bergler has a brief explanation of female homosexuality, but I didn't understand it."
1,Awful garbage from the Stone Age,"Prior to the removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental illnesses in 1973, it was quite common for psychiatrists to write toxic drivel like this, combining bizarre theories with fire-breathing homophobia. Bergler was the very worst of a bad lot. It is impossible to read this rubbish without seeing how extremely hostile Bergler was to gay people. Gore Vidal opined that these shrinks had been raised by mothers who wanted them to become clergymen, so they took a moralistic mentality with them into the field of ""medicine."""
4,Unexpected,My friends made buy this book. They rave about the author. I was not disappointed. Very well written. Entertaining and insightful.
4,"Old but if you are interested in classic papers, this is it",I bought it to replace all the chapters that I have copied over the years. (I need five more words to turn on the Submit button so here they are with spares).
5,DEXTER!!!,Dexter is one of the greatest shows out there. I was hooked after the first few episodes. This season is great too.
5,Dexter Amazing As Always,"I love this show. As always, the acting and storyline are excellent. Five stars hands down. I can't wait to start Season 6."
4,nice add to the collection,The series wrote itself into a tiny corner in season 4 and yet found a entertaining way to wiggle out and provide 12 more episodes. I miss seeing Dexter's wife but happy that the struggle between murder and protection continue.
4,"4 Stars for the Season, 2 for the actual DVD","The season itself was excellent, as usual, but the DVD itself is utterly ridiculous. The special features are all supposed to be accessed via ""E Bridge Technology"". What is this exactly? It's not explained on or in the DVD anywhere. So, with the features not on the TV, I popped the DVD in my laptop. ""Ebridge Technology"" pops up and I click on ""Access Dexter Special Features"". But what pops up? Not the features for season five, but for season four. One would think the DVD features would be handled a lot better than this, and I am thoroughly disappointed."
4,Dexter Season 5,"I love the Series, Dexter, but was this one (Season 5), was disappointing, as it was mostly about a woman he saved from her captor."
3,Dexter season 5,"Don't get me wrong, I love Dexter, but you can tell the writer's are beginning to fail. Sadly. The characters are now doing stuff they would have never done in previous episodes. They are grasping at straws and it shows."
5,Best Dexter yet!,I've watched every season - this one was extremely suspenseful - I didn't want it to end. Watched it in three nights. If you're a Dexter fan - make sure you buy this season (from Amazon.com).
2,"Great series, crappy DVDs","I'd just finished watching the UK release of Dexter season 4, and got this version of season 5, and while the show is great, the mastering of the DVDs seems to have been done by monkeys.Play all is randomly on some discs, but not others, and the chapterization is garbage. I want chapter skip to take me to the start of the episode, just after the titles, but no, this one is either the start of the titles, or some point inside the epsiode.How difficult can this be? It's not brain surgery, people!"
5,Something you have to see to believe,"To those of you who read these reviews to find out if this product is worth your money and time... let's just say it's one of the best investments you will ever come across. Must see series of our generation, honestly."
5,Dexter,I really enjoy watching every show. I'm hooked. I love the actors. They do such a great job and the writing is the best. I'm going to be sad when it's over.
5,Dexter is still aces!,"This season was terrific. I really don't have much more to add than that to this review, but I have to have over 16 words."
4,Waiting on Season 6,"Not at riveting as season 4 but still good.Sorry Dexter, you did not keep the perfect woman.Can't wait till season 6 comes out.I love Michael Hall...he was great in Six Feet Under."
5,Dexter fan again!,I loved this past season of Dexter and I will enjoy it over and over and over. I have all the seasons and occasionally do a whole weekend of watching Dexter with my friends. You can't go wrong with your friendly serial killer Dexter.
1,Did not work,"DVDs would not work. Tired in 3 different DVD players and in my laptop, would not work in any, awful waste of money!"
1,Disappointing at best,Amazon did a great job of getting the DVD to my door on the date promised. Excited I couldn't wait to watch these videos however after repeated delays in working properly in my XBOX I finally got the 1st and 2nd DVDs to work. I was not so lucky with the 3rd DVD. I cannot get it to play at all. I even tried another DVD player in case it was my XBOX player.Now I am waiting to call Amazon to see what can be done.
1,Dexter The Fifth Season,This item took almost 5 weeks to arrive and it was a pirated copy that didn't work. It was a gift for my daughter and we both were appalled!
1,International Availability,If the product is placed in an international market then it should be available internationally. I do not want to burn or download items illegally but this is very frustrating.
2,Worst Season of the Series,"If you're a Dexter fan, then obviously you will need to see this season. However, don't expect too much. I've noticed that, more often than not, when a series hits a high, its followed by a swift, and devestating low. And unfortunatly, to my great surprise, Dexter is one of these series. After 4 stellar seasons, everything that had so perfectly been built up seemingly disapears... Season 5 does get off to a great start; the season premiere brings a much-welcomed acknowldgement of the lasting effects of season 4. Dexter comes to the realization that he does in fact have feelings, and strong, non-threatening feelings at that. But then comes Lumen, and a storyline that I felt incredibly frustrating, familiar, and yet very-much forced. The murders were predictable, and the villians were so, so boring; especially when compared to Trinity. Oh well, you can't win em' all."
4,"Worst season yet, but it's still awesome","LOVE LOVE LOVE Dexter! But let's face it, they were kind of mailing this season in. Must have been tough with Michael sick and all! I still liked the storyline but just too many inconsistencies to ignore. Season six gets back to DEXTER"
3,I love Dexter,I love watching Dexter however this was not my favorite season. I am looking forward to season six. So far the second season has been my favorite.
5,Season 5 is great,"Dexter season 5 is great. This season is a transition for Dexter after the blood bath of season 4. The same dark drama, humor, and thoughtfulness of this show continues throughout the season, especially the later half. If you enjoyed Dexter before, you will also find more to like here."
5,Dexter continues to entertain!,"This Dexter has many surprises, as they all do and you wonder how he will continue to prevail. Love his humor and his new-found ability to share feelings. Why we route for him is beyond me!"
2,Should hearing-impaired viewers even bother?,"No subtitles for Season 4, just captions, which were a horrible jumble of missing and butchered words. CaptionMax points finger at poor mastering--will the same morons be in charge once again? How about doing some actual quality control, Showtime, or maybe even cough up some real subtitles this time around?"
3,"Good series, but enough with the commercials!","Season 5 is good classic Dexter and is surely worth watching, but it seems to have lost a little of its edge and didn't take as many risks as earlier seasons. Overall still very enjoyable. One peeve - the Showtime commercials cannot be skipped or even scurried through with fast-forward. VERY annoying, Showtime. I pay good money for DVD's so that I don't have to watch commercials if I don't want to!"
2,Blu Ray takes 15 minutes to load the disc...,"I almost returned my Blu Ray discs to the store because I thought there was some form of error because none of the discs would load. After researching online, I found others had this problem because Showtime forces the discs to go to BD-Live first, instead of just the normal disc screen to watch the episodes.What an extremely annoying and frustrating way to structure a disc. I will never buy another Showtime blu ray until they change this obnoxious policy.I'm beyond frustrated that I had to spend 30 minutes online researching just to find out that the disc would eventually load if I just stared at a blank screen for 15 minutes.Dexter is awesome, but Showtime gets an F for this."
2,Such a let down,I saw the first season of Dexter and could not wait to buy the rest. Once I watch them I pre-ordered Season 5 and kept checking to see if a date had been releases. This season doesn't even begin to measure up to the first four seasons. I just finished watching the second disk and I just can't believe how weak the story line is. It's very predictable. Hopefully disk 3 and 4 is better. Based off disk 1 and 2 I already know who Dexter's final victim will be. I hope I am wrong but I don't think I am. It's a good thing it's cheap.Update 20 AUG: I finished the series last night and it did end exactly like I thought it would. The whole show was predictable. I could walk away for 5 minutes or so and come back and never feel like I missed something. I never had that urge to back it up because something happened I wasn't expecting. Even if the actress was different I don't think it would have helped. The story line was just very slow and predictable.
5,Dexter Season Five,"Best show on television...couldnt stop watching it. Incredible acting, incredible story lines. Very excited to see the series coming in September 2012."
3,DEXTER'S DELIMMA,"Look, don't get me wrong, I love Dexter, but this is by far the weakest season. The story line was just ridiculous, even by Dexter standards. I loathed Julia Stiles in this, she is such an unlikeable actress. I really never felt any investment in her circumstance, I couldnt have cared less what happened to her..I kept yelling at the screen..GET ON THE PLANE, B**CH, YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW!..On the flip side, the actor playing Jordan was fantastic!!..I wanted more of him and less of her! The story between he and Dexter was what drove the season. Again, Dexter's rail thin profanity laiden sister, Deb was the limit...I mean, you're a cop in Miami and you don't know an fing WORD of Spanish?!!..WTF!..It all wrapped up well, I suppose, but I was left feeling...What happened to my Dexter!!"
3,Not up to the usual standard,"Other reviewers have said it before and better, so I will not repeat their opinions as much as agree with them. My husband and I were both disappointed with this season."
3,Sputters at the end,"I've been a Dexter fan from First Season, first episode to now, however as good as Season V was, it was a let down in the final episode. It was like they didn't know how to end it. Where the other 4 Seasons final episode left you stunned and anticipating what's next in the new Season, this one just pettered out. Too many loose ends, like the crashed car at the scene of final killing, plus the car was stolen by Dexter at the scene of the preivious killing in the van. Deb would not walk away from her quest to catch the killer.....and on and on. Anyway I'll look forward to the next Season, but I'm sure not counting the days like usual. Get the good writers back that will keep us addicted to this show as it has been in the past."
2,lots of scratches,"Many of the DVDs could not be watched. Didn't return it because I found a way to watch the season online, but this was a disappointment."
3,Missing scenes in the DVD?,"Big Dexter fan here, but it seems that Season 5's DVDs are missing some scenes. For example, when viewing the ""previously, on Dexter"" section before episode ""Circle Us"", there is a scene where Deb surprises Joe at his house - ""wanna debriefing before we hit the club again?"" - while the narc cop is sitting on his couch.I never saw that scene before in any of the previous episodes!Most of season 5's episodes are less than 40 minutes long, which wasn't the case with previous seasons.What gives, Showtime?"
5,awesome show,"Im writing to say, We love this show!!!! However, season four disc- four never came. Instead there were two disc three's in the package. We would love to have this disc sent to us. Thank you very much."
4,"Dexter, 5th Season.","We watched the first 4 seasons from the Library. Season 5 was not available, so I purchased it. Although reviews were not as favorable for season 5, I enjoyed it more than most earlier seasons. Julia Stiles is an amazing actor, and she really made this season. Season 5 progressed beyond the template of the series, opening new vistas in Dexter's personality, be they good or bad. As is usual in this series, character development is excellent, new characters are interesting and enjoyable, even if they are despicable, and the situations are intense. A great season! And now that we've watched this season, the Library has season 5."
3,No Surprises This Time,"As a self-proclaimed Dexteraholic (my wife and I watched all 5 seasons in under a month) I feel somewhat guilty writing a 3-star review. This show provided us with many hours of great entertainment. But in comparison to Seasons 1-4, three stars seems appropriate. I suppose were are all a little spoiled after the twists and turns and intricate plotlines in earlier seasons. But this season leaves almost nothing to the imagination. It's completely watchable, but it's also completely forgettable. The dark humor is also notably absent this season. If you've watched the first 4 seasons then I know you will watch Season 5 despite any negative reviews. And you should watch it, if only to stay current. But if you're new to this great series, don't start here. Seasons 1 and 2 are much stronger."
3,A Killer of a Series,"Dexter is absolutely riveting. My son lent me season 1 thru 3. I really wasn't expecting too much from the series. Boy was I surprised. I then purchased season 4. I watched it and then gave it to my son to add to his collection. I am now watching season 5 on Showtime. It is really addicting. When season 5 comes out in DVD I will purchase it as a gift to my son.Received the DVD this month (August 2011). I was very disappointed with the Special Features. The disc indicates that there are interviews with the cast ""via E-Bridge Technology, whatever the heck that means. I was unable to view these interviews which really ticked me off. I reduced my rating by 2 stars because of this rip off. What are they trying to prove?"
2,getting to be too mechanical and predictable,"I found the new series a disappointment. It lacked the tight, creative writing with twists and turns that commonly found in the previous season; the plot line seemed to be on autopilot. Also, the story is also becoming even more less believable, which takes away from it (e.g. dexter investigating the blood sample of a fellow co-worker who is suspected of murder, a pickup truck that happens to throw every body all over the road, and other silly incidents)."
2,Poor DVD Quality; Disappointing Performance,"The quality of this product was about the worse thing I've seen on DVD from Amazon. It was distracting. Just awful. The seller replaced it immediately, but I don't think it was the seller's fault. Also, Julia Stiles was just not the right choice. I was so bored with her performance (and panting) - a first while watching my favorite show on TV. Fingers crossed for Season 6."
3,faulty product,"Hello, I realize that mftg is probably responsible but disc 4 of the season we received is faulty. It is scratched..has some raised areas so it pauses and won't play thru. thank you!"
3,"I love this show, I hate Showtime","Why is this title NOT available in digital format? This is ridiculous. Guess what, Showtime. I waited patiently for you to finally release this at Amazon, but it never happened. I would have bought every episode! Too bad for you that there are places out there where one can watch it for free. Now I've seen the season. Great season, by the way. I miss Rita, but Julia Stiles was a good fit, it seemed. Still, how could that have worked. Oh, well. Looks like my money and I will go elsewhere. Thanks for Dexter 5, but not in digital format."
1,I recommend Death Note,"If you want a good series that involves a seriel killer/psychopath as the main character check out Death Note. It has a very unique storyline that deals with both Japanese mythology, crime drama. Also that show has something this show is really missing and that is a foil 2 the main character. In the Death Note Series it is a character that goes by the nick name of L, an easy going, ecentric, but extremely intellegent detective that tracks the moves of the main character seriel killer Light/Kira. That is what this series needs a very witty and clever detective who will target and eventually catch Dex when it is all said and done with. But anyways this series doesn't offer anything really, and this season was just as pointless as the others."
1,"Great Show, Good Season, Unforgivably Poor Quality","Dear CBS,I understand that you're trying desperately to sell BluRay, but the quality of these DVD transfers just keep getting worse every year. The film transfer would be of a higher quality if you sold the bootlegged version. No excuses -- do better or we'll quit buying altogether."
5,Awesome show is awesome.,"I have been watching the entire collection on amazon from 1-5 cause I am stuck at home for surgery and cant work for a week...And I have to say a week well spent. This show is amazing, if you haven't seen it yet, please do."
2,Showtime's DVDs are horribly set up,"This is a fine season of Dexter, but the DVD forces you to watch a Showtime promo at the beginning that CONTAINS DEXTER SPOILERS! You can't fast-forward, chapter-skip, or menu-skip during this promo set. I'm not sure if the broadcast version had this problem, but the color grading applied is obscenely orange in this season. Everyone looks like they just got a bad spray tan."
1,Epic Fail,"I downloaded the unbox and purchased Dexter: Season 5 three days ago. I have yet to watch an episode without a lot of stops to load. Each episiode takes anywhere from 2hrs to 24hrs to download. I purchased all the other seasons copies at a department store. However, when I discovered that it was possible to download from Amazon and view instantly, let's just say I was thrilled beyond words, but there you go. . .Amazon: unbox is an epic fail!!!"
1,"Returned item, never got a refund","I got this item and watched it right away. The last episodeon the 2nd disk skipped really badly. Unable towatch the last 15 minutes. Sort of a problem since I have never seen the episode before. Then the third disk had random little skips. I contacted the seller and was told send it back and I will refund it no problem.I was very happy and impressed with the service. I mailed it back on 9-12-11. Havent been refunded. Contacted the seller, he asked for my tracking number, I dont have one since I shipped it USPS from my job. Never heard from the seller again. I have emailed him several times. Looks like I have no product and Im out about 30.00. Wont order from this seller again. I was very cooperative and gave many chances to right the wrong.For the record THIS SEASON OF DEXTER IS AMAZING. The parts we saw were amazing!"
2,Okay,I am kind of done with Dexter. The beginning was awesome but then it got kind of repetitive and boring.I think Showtime should shelf this series and move on to something else.
1,Very poor quality,"Disc #2, purchased brand new, was filmy. Upon playing, the disc skipped several times and eventually stopped. I cleaned the disc, but the same behavior continued. Very disappointed and want a refund."
5,Dexter DVD,DVD came on time and was in excellent condition. This season is really good - great acting and a very suspenseful plot.
5,I love Dexter!,"I read some of the other reviews where people weren't happy with the storyline or the characters... I have no idea why someone would be unhappy with this season of Dexter! I love this show because there's always an unexpected twist that keeps you guessing until the very end, and this season does not disappoint!"
1,Last Disk didn't work!,Love Love Love Dexter! The last disk didn't work but we didn't open it up until it was past the time to get a replacement. Stupid Amazon! Still haven't seen the last episode of the fifth season!
3,Disk 3 skips,Everything was good untill i put disk 3 in and the last 2 episodes of the disk skips. You dont get to see the full episodes.
2,Poor quality,The video was very pixelated. I suppose I should have realized that the price would indicate the quality of the product.
2,Another step down in the Dexter series,An increasingly non-credible story line coupled with a series of out of character mistakes has put me off the Dexter series. This episode was the last straw in that it has almost no character development while the cast seems to be getting into ever more complex but ultimately superficial problems. Stick to the first seasons and continue watching at your own peril.
2,not up to par,I've watched all of Dexter and a bit surprised how people think this season is great. I honestly feel it's the worst season so far. Maybe developments here and there are great but the thing about Dexter is the main person who is the killer. Nothing can top Lithgow from season 4 and then also his brother in Season 1. But this killer sequence was not good at all. Nothing shocking at all when there were opportunities to really break new ground.
2,Arrrgh! Why use Julia Stiles???,"Why on earth the producers would have ruined the entire season with the lack-of performance by Julie Stiles is beyond me when they showed such wisdon in their casting the first 5 seasons. She just phones in her ""acting"" and her attitude is also SO poor. I really hope they get a dynamic girl for the upcoming season to replace her! The replacement doesn't have to be likable, doesn't have to be gorgeous, just NOT Stiles."
3,The worse season so far,I am a huge Dexter fan and have really enjoyed the first 4 seasons of this show. I also purchased these seasons on dvd. I will NOT be adding season 5 to my collection. If you want to know why please read the other review titled Disappointing and flat. The person that wrote that review was spot on with what he said about the show.
1,A horrible Chinese copy...,"DVD was received in a timely manner however, it had chinese subtitles and had to check turn off subtitles every time we insert a DVD. Also, it was a horrible copy because at the end of one of the episodes, the preview of the next one was on there. I will contact the seller for a return/replacement."
4,A must for engaged couples,Great book - especially for engaged couples who are serious about their pending marriage. Also a must for newlyweds or young couples who find their marriage in a little trouble. Perfect for the periodic check-up of a good marriage that needs only a little tweaking. Don't know how much help it would be for those who are in severe trouble within their marriage but it couldn't hurt.
4,I only wish my wife would read it,The book is excellent. I think a couple could make great progress on their relationship by going through it together.
4,Good ideas to improve any marriage,"This is a well-written book about the differences between the genders. The Rosbergs may have let their egos get the best of them when they allowed themselves to be labeled ""America's Family Coaches,"" but that ego isn't otherwise much in display on these pages. They have a humility that is refreshing in Christian books. Insightful and full of real-life examples that will help most readers understand how they can better understand their spouses."
2,Not worth the price,"Take my word that these AMSCO books are not worth your money. The tabs to the latest songs on Bon Fire are completly wrong. They are the tabs to the recorded version from Highway To Hell and not the demo tracks from the BonFire Volts CD!!!!The only song that has been tabbed almost correct from VOLTS is ""back seat confidentionl"" but the other tracks are that of which was on HTH and not what is on the album.... it is a rip off to buy a tab book for an album and they have not got that song tabbed!If you see this book at a cheap price, then it would be worth a purchase, but dont pay too much, because no more then 60% of the book has been tabbed correctly, and the transcripts are incoorect to way too many songs!"
2,Mistake,i honestly think the little mistakes but people get over it what do you want angus young to personally teach you it him self but their is mistakes like the first page it says that rcker whas written by bj ay my thats not right its bs ay my
3,I have read the book but I also hate Andy,"This book is good at introducing us to the premier capitalists of the nineteenth century, but the substance is superficial and biased in the extreme. Like Andy, Josephson blindly assumes that the financial success achieved by the ""Robber Barons"" is attributable to their somehow taking advantage of the common man. The fact that these men developed new ways to produce goods at a lower cost, and making them available to the masses, while at the same time making jobs available to thousands, is conveniently forgotten. A much more accurate account of these men can be found in THE MYTH OF THE ROBBER BARONS by Burton Folsom, Jr."
1,An opportunist marxist,The writer was a stock broker who had lost his fortune in 1929. This personal failure had made him lose faith in himself - and mankind to pursue its own happiness.
1,Too confusing!,"I have questions about the premise of this book as described in the product review section. How exactly does one ""seize economic power""? If something can be seized does this mean that the thing exists already? If so, is economic power a natural occurence? Is it there for the taking by those shrewd enough or lucky enough to find it? Even if one does find economic power to seize, how exactly does one do it? And what about the rights of others who might arrive on the scene about the same time? Do they have a just claim to seize economic power for themselves instead of others? Answers to these questions are too complex for a man such as myself. Thank goodness for intellectuals who raise these abstract issues in order to provide the more abstact explanations."
5,Good Product,"I like it a lot and the fit is perfect. I was surprised that it's closer to hard plastic than rubber. I would never describe it as being rubber, it's plastic, but it's still OK. Works well, so I'm happy with it."
4,A ripping good read!,"Great literature it is not - you need to suspend reality to accept the highly implausible plot and cartoony characters. That said, this is a thoroughly enjoyable romp, non-stop page turning action and easy-to-follow narrative. Stunning beauty Jean Biggerland defies the traditional portrayal of innocent society ladies by being about as sociopathic as anyone in literature. It chronicles her efforts to do away with the innocent heroine Lydia Meredith (who is so utterly stupid you pretty much wish Jean would succeed) for an inheritance. Lydias protector is Jean's nemesis Jack Glover. Will he expose the nefarious Jean before Lydia is nobbled? I loved it!"
3,keeps you entertained throughout BUT,The plot - fantastic; suspense - keeps you reading on and on until the end leaves you waiting for what - the punishment that never materialized. Is there a sequel to this story? There should be. I gave it a three star because the angel got away and there were too many mistakes in the book.
5,One of a kind...,"Really wonderful deck. It`s just perfect...the art is well done, soft,beautiful and meaningful colors. It feels good to the eyes of the mind. I`ve learned that the best Tarot decks are those that keeps simple, because the unconscious approaches symbols and images more directly in this way. This deck has a perfect balance, not too busy with the art, but lot of symbols and beautiful artistic design.Also,there are many connections between the cards, this is the most important when I`m making a spread. When I`m reading I try to find connections in symbols, textures, colors,movement, backgrounds, figures positioning...etc...This deck is as good as the Ryder Waite, but more earthy and heart warming. I own about a dozen good decks, but this one is outstanding...."
2,Not really compelling,"I bought this deck mainly because of reviews that spoke of the beautiful and compelling artwork, but, unfortunately, I do not find it so. The images taken separately look like they were done by a talented high school student. Many of the figures are awkwardly drawn and this distracts from the overall effect of the cards. If you are looking for a deck rich in symbolism, you won't find that here either."
3,History referenced music,"This album is historical metal and is notable but not as notable as death penalty in my opinion. No screaming and yelling all the words can be heard and are sung. They are in the likes of wytchfinde at the time but a little heavier. I would not say it is heavy metal by today's groups but again for 1980 or so it was considered heavy metal. The new wave of British Metal NWOBM is ok I am not one to hype any music much just by everyone saying ohh its what everyone was saying was the best at the time. This album is not worth 30 american dollars get death penalty for a heavier riffed album, or get pentagram relentless which is to me is close to death penalties riffs for an affordable price."
3,early 80's sabbath clone doom band,"too much sab influence for them to be original, but still very good if you like sab doom. The singer sounds more like John Gallager of the early 80's metal band Raven (before they sold out in the mid 80's), mixed in with a bit of Todd Rundgren (especially when he was in The Nazz). I kind of picture this as early Sabbath mixed with early Raven played slowly."
4,"Works fine, reasonable price","This piece works exactly as described. Two 4-pin connectors connect in to create one 6-pin connector. The cables were long enough to reach from my power supply to the back of the video card. It was nice not having to purchase a new power supply!As some of the other reviews said, the connection ends are a little cheap-ish. I was actually able to push the 6-pin end into the back of my video card UPSIDE DOWN! The pins were shaped correctly, but I was still able to push them in, likely due to the cheapness of the plastic. Luckily I stopped before I powered up the unit and inserted it the correct way. Just don't do what I did...look closely and make sure the pins are going in the right direction.But once again, I have had no issues running my new video card. Steam games are FULL STEAM AHEAD!"
5,works,"this product works for what i needed it to work on.. my nvidia 560 graphics card. a little costly, but it works and needed it fast"
4,"Works fine, no problems.","This adapter works as described, and seems to be of decent quality. It was inexpensive and properly priced, and saved me from having to buy a better power supply for alot more money and hassle putting one in."
3,"Works,some maintenance required","The pins were a little out of place and I had to manually adjust them to fit. But aside from that, I haven't had any issues with it, does what it is supposed to do."
5,Worked perfectly!,"I recently ordered one of these so I could power an ATI 6870 video graphics card in a Shuttle SH67H3 XPC box with the 300watt power supply.Worked exactly as I expected, packaging was minimal (I like) and the molex connectors fit better than most I've used around this price point.Simple, easy, and works exactly as advertised! Thanks."
5,Works as expected,"This adapter helped power my XFX Radeon 6870 which required two 6 pin PCI-Express headers. My 430w Power Supply only came with one 6-pin header, so I went ahead and ordered this and I was able to Plug & Play without issues. Just be realistic with your system components if running on a smaller power supply."
2,Works but flimsy,"The product works as intended but is cheaply made and feels it. While pushing the adapter on to the 4 pin connector, the pins on the adapter began to come out the other side so I had to be careful."
3,It works but uses too many molex 4pins,We all know there is a limited number of hook ups on a power supply. Being as such I find it a pain that this adapter uses up 2 molex 4pin connectors to deliver its 6pin deal. I don't have many connections to spare! After using a blue led fan that runs off an adapter for molex 4pin and not having enough stat drive power plugs to choose from I am forced to adapt molex 4 pin to sata power and Im short on power supply resources now. I got a 550 watt logisys black ball bearing silent power supply. its great but didn't have enough 6pins my video card wants one and my mother board wants one on top of the other two power connections to the board. AHHHHHH computers drive me crazy but I love them. ANy ways this workd but its ugly and uses 2 thingys thats all.
3,Very Basic book of Common Mushrooms,"This was my very first book on mushrooms and it certainly made me want to learn lots more about mushrooms. It didn't take me long to realize that this book comes up short because it does only identify a few common mushrooms. I love the format of this book with its nice spiral binding and very large pictures. The descriptions about each mushroom are very informative and you don't have to flip back and forth through the book because the descriptons are with the pictures. There is an interesting section on preparing edible GILLED mushrooms for eating. Definitly a nice book to have, but I wouldn't want it to be the only mushroom book in my collection!"
1,Big bust!!,"I bought this card based on other customer recommendations. I could not get this installed properly over a period of 2 weeks. While the Graphics part did install and work, the TV and Video Player was another story completely. I tried several installations, couldn't get it to work right. I went to ATI's website and downloaded a Driver Bundle, just for WinXP. This did not work either. Called their Tech Support, they checked a few things, sent some written instructions, and never did get it to work right. I work in computers, and may not be an expert, but I am no dummy either....I've installed other cards before, but this card, as far as I'm concerned is nothing but A BIG BUST!! And I can't say I was impressed with ATI's Tech Support. I will not buy ATI ever again."
1,too many installation problems,"The idea of this card is terrific - get great video, watch TV on your computer, record TV shows just like Tivo. But despite the fact that I generally know my way around computers, I have not been able to get this card working after spending weeks trying various combinations of settings, driver updates, reinstallations, and BIOS updates. Every time I watch video on the PC, the system suddenly reboots, usually within a few minutes. Unfortunately, I am past the time period where I can return this card - for the money I paid, I should have bought a regular TV instead. I may try another TV tuner, but it will not be one made by ATI."
1,Horrible book,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever bought and read. The print is terrible, the notational conventions very unusual with very limited Mathematical exposition on the subject. I found the book very limited in its ability to present far less prove general principles. Seems like a bunch of class notes put together and printed for public consumption."
5,Nesbit's best,"More than a quarter of a century ago my sisters and I were captivated by E. Nesbit, and particularly by THE MAGIC CITY. Long unavailable (I have scoured used book shops and the Net for copies for various children) it is great to have it easily available once more. I am happy to report that my own daughter was as taken with it as her aunts and I a generation earlier, and like us she at once began building magic cities of her own. I realize that I risk the wrath of Potterites everywhere, but I suspect that in a hundred years children and their parents will still be enjoying The Magic City while Harry is at most the subject of earnest dissertations on odd trends in the early 21st century. If you have a spark of imagination and an eager child handy, grab this book."
2,not timeless,"It's a rare child today who would find the main character, a fussy little momma's boy, interesting. Intead, get kids Edgar Eager's books, starting with Half Magic. The children in each of Eager's 7 books have flaws, but they learn to behave from each other and from the world of magic. The Magic Garden boy eventually learns, but he's awfully dense."
4,"An entertaining, non-violent mystery set in the desert of Az","This is a fun, easy-to-read and entertaining story of romance and intrique. There's nothing violent, bloody, or grizzly in it so you don't have shudder at horrific events. Nonetheless, you're captured by the story of Concha, the connection with Drew, and the added value of interesting facts about the history of the Southwest, particularly Tuscon, Arizona. I enjoyed the descriptions of homes and furniture, food and clothes, interior design and exterior landscapes. The book flows well and although it wasn't a book I couldn't put down for an instant, it kept my attention, I read it rapidly, and I was sorry when it came to its very fitting ending. I've recommended it to several friends who all have enjoyed it immensely, including people from places other than the Southwest!"
2,Plague Court murders,this book dragged for me I found myself skipping many pages to get through it. just not my taste I guess
1,Solo en vallenatos,"en este disco se pretende a Carlos Vives en un rubro melódico con pegajosas y cursis baladas, algunas buenas canciones pero que no son mejores que en su versión original. Me encanta Carlos Vives, pero lo suyo son definitivamente los vallenatos! donde nadie niega que es el rey!"
3,"Technical, costly and wonderful!","I bought this book out of desperation during an inexplicable research phase that took possession of my private life for a period of time. The purchase was well worth it (to me) because this book coughs up information that is just simply not available from any other source. I felt and still feel that the super-in-depth, unique content of this book justified its exorbitant price tag.However, it is not a book that was written for casual reading. The text is technical, laborious and demands a great deal of time and concentration to wade through its characteristic ""Doctoral Thesis"" style. Potential purchasers would be well advised to gauge with prudence their level of patience, budget, and time available before making a one-click purchase."
3,not same size,"the hat delivered is not the same size as the hat depicted in the picture. its much shorter, therefore does not fit as well"
3,Cute Book,"This is a very small easy to read book. I bought it because we too had a one legged mallard male show up in our yard one day, and became a constant visitor. He became fairly tame and would allow us to get very close to feed him seeds and such, and it was fascinating and heartbreaking to watch him try to fit in with normal 'duck society.' I was expecting the story to be somewhat similiar, but it is mostly about a hunter (who almost shoots him a couple times) and for my taste, it takes a little too long for the hunter to finally realize, maybe hunting isn't for him anymore. Cute book, but not my favorite! We'll see if our own peg leg pete returns this year."
2,You must acquire a taste for this type of opera,"If you are an operatic intelligentsia or a lover of Baroque opera you will rate this 5 stars. Yes you have to acquire a taste for this type of opera. I am the average opera lover having seen about 140 operas in my life....and this simply is not to my taste. I am glad this was only the 3 hour version by Copley. First not sure why they had everyone in Baroque costumes including Cleopatra, disconcerting to have Julius Caesar sung by a female, Ptolemy was dressed like a clown, and not a fan of counter-tenors and incessant recitatives like in a mass. The entire opera was stodgy. Video and sound quality were excellent. I have never heard an opera before Mozart that I enjoyed. Never-the-less I am glad I saw and heard it...I can cross that off my bucket list."
2,Don't waste your money,There are lots of interesting tarot decks out there. This is not one of them.
1,"99% Politics, 1% Music","Sure, I enjoyed Harvest, CSNY and the Crazy Horse stuff. But let's be honest about his most recent effort. The prodution and arrangement is horrible and Neil's voice has never sounded more like Popeye's whiney girlfriend Olive Oil. I don't mind the guy using politics to sell records. Much of his best material was political. But at least in the old days he complemented his opinions with memorable music."
2,sophmoric,"For the record, let me first say I am a die-hard NY fan. I've been listening to him since I was a teenager 30 years ago. Maybe if I was still a teenager, I'd like this CD. But, it's a bunch of three-chord ranting (ok maybe four or five in a few cases) with little reflection, humor or artistry that Neil is capable of, and I just can't seem to get very worked up listening to it. The lyrics are lame, regurgitating the same ole protests against Bush to the point they have lost their effectivness. Why not a ballad like Powderfinger or Pocohontas, or a rewrite of Cortez titled ""Bush the Killer""? Now that would get my attention. If you're going to protest Neil, make it a genuine effort next time."
5,Great Prophetic Album,"This is a great Neil Young album and a bit prophetic in ""Lookin' For a Leader"" (and this from early 2006) where he mentions maybe it's a woman, maybe a black man and the mentions Obama by name. Even more interesting in hindsight."
3,Good,"Its about time someone made a anti war album. ""Lets Impeach the President"" is a great thought- provoking song. ""Roger and Out"" is also great so is the title track and ""After The Garden"". Everyone should buy this. This is real music from an artist who actually can play instruments."
3,"Too much choir music, not enough Neil","Too much choir music, not enough neil. Origional cutting edge Neil young but I prefer to hear him not the back up singers"
5,"Great music and great message, guy is got the courage","One of the few great musicians out there not cowered by the commercial interests. Says it like it is, wish more of these purely for the money flunkys had the balls."
3,Drums Across The Potomac,"It's Neil. It's a stupid war. Kids are killed,daily. It's a great message. The drums are a little for-front and high-toned. So what?It's still a stupid war. My brother has been bush-wacked. I see ""W"" on back of cars. I see cut-out magnet ribbons in multi-facet colors demanding: ""Support Our Troops"". I see yard signs: ""Troops Out Now"".You know, the troops are 20 years old. Some are nineteen, some are twentytwo, twenty four, or more. A lot of them come back home dead. It's the ""restless consumer"" that keeps it going. ""Heave-Ho"". I see some of Bush's crew is calling it quits and going home. I wonder if the troops would like to do that too? Oh well, it all in the cd."
5,Classic Young,"Simply put, Living with War is classic Neil Young and he has not lost his sense for political outrage and dissent through his musical prose. I guarantee you will hear people chanting the lyrics Lookin' For A Leader in the Mid-Term elections and leading up to 2008."
2,"Sorry,not up to par","I sold this on ebay. I was shocked at how unprofessional this sounds. It's like Neil recorded it in 10 min. The production sucks. I usually love Neil Young, but this cd was bad. The words are great, the music not so."
2,All the songs sound the same,"I've been a fan of Neil Young for almost 40 years, and I love many of his albums. This album is an anti-war effort, and for that I applaud him. In his songs, Neil has always tackled tough issues like war and the environment. However, the music is the most important thing, not the message, and all of the songs on ""Living with War"" sound the same. In fact, the songs on this album sound very similar to those on Greendale. Living with War has none of the beautiful melodies for which Neil is known and admired. The music is forgettable."
1,Out of his league!,"Stick to songs about other issues Neil. You know nothing about politics. It's all ""feel good"" BS that means nothing."
4,Very good CD but will not stand the test of time,"The music deserves a solid 4 stars, but the lasting impact will not be as strong. I love that Neil has gotten back that passion and if he can continue this trend on his next CD ""God love it"". As stated above the only negative for this CD is that in 10 yrs this will have very little value except as a nostalgia piece for when we needed a voice in the music industry but keep rockin Neil."
5,Christine,"Whew I'm spellbound with this album. The hairs on my arms stood up! It is such a relief to hear someone as eloquent as Brother Neil put my exact feelings onto a CD. He's telling it like it is folks -- you may not always want to be hit over the head with it, but it's the ugly truth! He loves this country but doesn't like what's going on here lately -- who does? Rock On - Truth Is Power."
2,Good Message...,"... really crappy recording. That's the only reason I'm rating it so low. The content could be framed much better if the production matched the intensity of the lyric. If you're looking for something to relate to on the political front, it's a great album. For repeated listenings, it's a tough album to get behind."
2,Living with Bush Bashing Musicians,"I got into Neil Young back in the days of ""Rust Never Sleeps"". I'm a huge fan of his classic stuff, and I suppose it always will be. It's part of the soundtrack of my life.I don't agree with Neil's politics on this one, but I do have to admit that this CD rocks. In my opinion, the song ""Let's Impeach the President"" got too much attention too soon, no doubt due to the provocative title. That's too bad. I personally don't think it one of the better songs on this album. I found myself enjoying ""Shock and Awe"" despite myself.So, if you can't get enough of that signature Neil Young ""godfather of grunge"" sound, you'll probably enjoy this CD, and if you don't like our current president, you'll likely love it.Twenty years from now, however, when people look back on Neil Young's career, I doubt that this will be considered his finest hour, or even his finest 40 minutes."
1,THE SIXTIES ARE LONG GONE NEIL GET OVER IT!!!,I have been a faithful fan of Neil's for thirty some years. This album is pathetic to say the least. Why not just write a book or something to express your feelings instead of trying to put it to music. The spirit of sixties is gone (thank god) and these old hippies need to realize that was a place in time that cannot and will not be recaptured. Skip this one.
1,Pure vitriol.,A once great songwriter reduces himself to the level of a political hack. The lyrics of this album are unbelievably simplistic and trite. There is no art here. Just a bunch of left-wing bile. Garbage.
2,Not horrible,"But not good, by Neil's standards.The lyrics are boring and so is much of the music.While this is not as bad as Landing on Water, Life or Are You Passionate, it probably is worse than any other Neil album.Many people blindly praise this album because Neil shares their dislike of Bush. Dislike of Bush does not make a good record."
3,Neil the Geezer needs Crazy Horse,"Disregarding GREAT early sets like After The Gold Rush, Harvest, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, etc., Mr. Young's solo stuff has oftentimes been lame to fair. This set is at least plugged in, but it still lacks punch. Two or three good tracks. Certainly the best he's put out in quite a while. I think Neil should lay off the ""theme albums"" like Greendale and Bush, and go back to ""F___in' Up""."
5,"Brilliant,great,awesome",Living with war is a great album from Mr Young after Rust never sleeps.This great album is pure aggro rock which is very unlike his folkish albums like Praire wind.I love this album and just cant stop listening to it since I got it 2 weeks back.Long live Niel Young.
5,Protest music that's long overdue,"A work of great power and courage! I salute Neil the artist, who gives voice to those of us who are too scared to voice our true opinions. The title track gave me goosebumps when I first listened to it and, to this day, can often move me to tears. His ""God Bless America"" with a full-bodied choir is one for the ages and would sound great in any church or 4th of July parade or fireworks show - or protest rally. ""Flags of Freedom"" really does remind one of Bob Dylan's ""Chimes of Freedom"" from the early 1960s. Buy it for your friends, give it away as a gift, blast it from your boombox and watch the sun rise (or set). Listen to it at the Grand Canyon. Hail to a true American artistic hero!!"
1,Another Dust Collector,"I own over 50 Neil albums and bootlegs and have been a fan since ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"".Neil, please.... let Steve Earle write the NEW protest songs...please! These songs are embarrassing when compared to ""Ohio"". I don't agree with Earle or Neil politically, but at least Earle's lyrics are cogent, entertaining, and the arrangements rock. I don't mind opposing views expressed by musical artists, but I sure wish my favorite artist could come up with something better than the inane lyrics for this album and the uninspiring regurgitated guitar from Greendale.This is strictly an album for the Bush-hating and USA-loathing Air America crowd. Absolutely nothing here to cull for any real Neil fan who loves...Ragged Glory, Mirror Ball, Sleeps With Angels, Freedom, Live Rust, Zuma, TNTN, Harvest, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and After The Goldrush."
1,Just a thought....,"Neil Young and his admirers here on Amazon and Democratic Underground, Daily Kos, et al might want to think about this: He lives and works in a country where he can spout off this kind of stuff and all that happens is some people decry his lack of sense, say he should go back to Canada, etc. Now, what would happen to him if he were Iraqi, Iranian, name the Muslim country of your choice (or, at times, some European countries)? Prison, beheading, shredding...DEATH. The people living under that kind of oppression don't deserve the freedom Neil has in America-is that what I'm to understand? They can live in daily fear but at least Neil can ""stick it to the man"" as one other reviewer wrote. Doesn't seem like Neil is all that bold and fearless to me."
1,Please Neil...,"Let me start out by saying that I have been a huge Neil Young fan over the years. But I for one am sick of the anti-war rhetoric...its not enlightening or constructive anymore. Neil should be more concerned with the socialist communist state of his country, than telling us what to do with ours. Lets Impeach the President? I dont even like Bush...but come on. But hey, im sure this album found its niche among America haters, and those who will protest war at any expense.Perhaps I could understand better if it werent musically stale...I dont like the message, I dont like the music. I know Neil can do better without having to pull the old protest gimmick to get sales."
2,"If you're into good music, this isn't that good.","There are some pretty good, if somewhat reused, riffs (Neil's still getting mileage from ""Rockin in the Free World""). The lyrics aren't all that. Sorry, but they aren't. This album is better than ""Re-ac-tor"" (a total waste of vinyl in the days of vinyl), but its only sales point is protesting the war and pandering to the people who hate Bush.Bottom line - there is one good song, two okay songs and the rest is truly forgettable. Young was smart to start the album with ""After the Garden"", but its all downhill from there, and ""Impeach the President"" just blows.If you're looking for anything of the quality of ""Old Man"" or ""Horse with no Name"", look elsewhere.If you want some decent music, get the RHCP's ""Stadium Arcadium""Those of you who say different - well - take a reality pill."
1,Living With War?,"If there is any of the creativity, fire, or outrage (where even Richard Nixon has got soul) that one could expect from Neil Young in this CD, I have not found it. DO NOT BUY! Burn if you must; I doubt you'll be happy."
2,"""Say Anything You Wanna, I Have Heard It All"" - Bob Dylan","I don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. Neil is a strong voice to be heard and respected, but ""Living With War"" only adds to the rhetoric. I voted with my brain and heart so of course George Doobie Bush did not get MY vote! I appreciate Neil speaking out but if he is not a registered voter, that is one vote we lose to the ignorant leaders currently in the White House. It's one thing to get on a bull horn and shout the obvious and quite another to make a real difference. What Bob said in '63 still remains valid for me:""And I hope that you dieAnd your death'll come soonI will follow your casketIn the pale afternoonAnd I'll watch while you're loweredDown to your deathbedAnd I'll stand o'er your grave'til I'm sure that you're dead.""The public that is voting this album to be the end all be all are the same ones that voted for the idiot president."
2,"I'd Love to Change the World, But I Don't Know What to Do","Listen, I don't like Bush much either and I think we're putting way too many resources into military endeavors. But come on, this is popular music, not the McLaughlin Group or some political show. Look at those song titles and the album title - just what do you expect from the album? Aren't you getting sick of hearing celebrities trying to offer vicarious advice on how the world should be run? Is Neil nostalgic for the good ol' days in the sixties when everyone was a hippie and we all had a big, bad guy to protest against? That classic song ""I'd Love to Change the World"" from 1971 or so pretty much sums up the problem with celebrities politicizing and pushing politics in their music. You know what they say about news, it has a shelf life about as good as fish. This topical stuff just is not timeless."
2,Lame!,"Never forget that this guy was in CSNY!!! He has done a few good things like Rust Never Sleeps but he also has a history that everybody seems to have forgotten...Indeed, some people seem to forget that actually in the 70's and 80's Neil Young was equated by some of us as THE hippie. And he has managed to deliver one big hippie album.OK so there is some dostortion on the production...ok the album is based on good intentions but the sweet harmonies...really it is too much. OK Greendale was maybe worse but does that really mean anything. I mean I like some of his stuff, I really do but here he is stretching my patience quite a bit."
1,Sophmoric,"Just plain BAD it seems as though a 14 year old has written the ""protest yrics"" when he was mad with out trying to be somewhat intelligent. It also sounds as if he used the same drum machine through out the disc while just singing stream of consceinceness lyrics to it. As a lifelong Neil fan I guess I will have to just fogive him for this Schlock! as I also did for Greendale and Are you Passionate."
2,"Album should be titled ""Pounding on Drums""","I agree with the political sentiment but Neil Young has fallen far short of his capabilities when it comes to the ""music"". There's no melodies. Just reciting to cord changes and drum banging. Neil, you could have done so much more with this."
2,"I Hate To Say This, But...","...all that's going to occur with the release of this CD is an increase in Neil Young's savings or checking account.The music itself is very bland, and, of course, the lyrics are politically incendiary but ultimately go nowhere.We all know what's happening in this country. A rock musician isn't going to change anything. That's trite, I know, but it's true.If there was anything like a percentage of the profits from the sale of this disc going to an organization that was truly making a bid to get this mess over with, then I wouldn't feel so bad about where my 13.99 was going.As it is, I feel I've wasted my money and, because it's a lame and not particularly engaging record, this one won't get much more playing time on my system."
1,I Do Not Agree With Neil Young...,"...but as someone I thought intellectually honest, I can see where he's coming from. I'm a conservative Republican, and I too have the feeling that Bush sold us out. When ARE we going to attack Saudi Arabia anyways?"
4,Rock and Roll -anti Bush at it's best,"This album , is very straight forwards, classic Neil Young jamming, and sliding rock and roll with a sizzling powerfullmessage to the sorry state of afairs with the inept Dope of aexcuse for a presedent in King George Bush , and his parasiteteam of criminals,say it like it is and keep on rocking ,similar to freedom in several ways + with the excellent 100 singers backing up some songs with a trumpet thrown the mix.For a album made in 9 days it is pure genius ,Well done Neil.Paul J Letteri"
3,"Young, only average","I am a big Neil Young fan, but this album is certainly not a ""must have"" for enjoying Neil!"
2,Disappointed,"Forget the politics, I buy music CDs to hear music. Maybe 2-3 tracks on this CD are actually musically interesting, the others are merely ranting with badly arranged repetetive chords played along to justify calling the track a ""song"". Even the normally melodic piece ""America the beautiful"" is grating to the ears in this version, due to the screechiness of the vocals. I know you're pissed off, Neil... that's okay, but I was hoping to buy some nice music. This CD certainly is not of the high quality I expect from Neil Young."
2,Tired,"I have been a Neil Young fan for decades. Like many others my age, I cut my teeth on his music, followed him into his electric phase, and bought and learned to play just about everything he recorded.This album is tired. Its the same old licks you've heard before and, whether you agree with his politics or not, his lyrics just don't have the sharp edge that they once did. He has written so many compelling songs with strong social or political messages in his time (Ohio, Zuma, Rockin' in the Free World). He stands in a small group of musicians that can claim to be among the most influential of our time.So, given that I think so highly of him, let me say that I wish he hadn't recorded this album and I am sorry I bought it."
3,"Hard to love, harder to hate, even harder to review","It's impossible to review an album like this without addressing the Bush issue. So, up front, I don't like what he's done as president and never voted for him.But, as a few people have said, does that automatically mean any book or song or paiting or film that denounces Bush, no matter how convincingly, is 'good'? Ugh. Along with politics, we have to define 'good' and get into a debate on aesthetics? This is too much to ask!Seriously, though, there are moments here where the emotional tenor of what Young is saying overpowers the otherwise uninspiring music. Honestly, if this album was about anything other than Bush, it would be easily forgettable.Still, I celebrate Young's courage for using his art to express himself so forcefully -- even if it's a few years too late (in my opinion). I wish more artists would use their voices to do what the media has failed to do -- point out the hypocrisy of leaders, regardless of their political affiliation."
2,Sorry but overall not too great Neil,"From a tremendous Neil Young Fan:- Lyrics: bits and pieces of good Neil Young mixed with what I felt were ""quick & dirty"" lyrics. Most songs need a bit more polish.- Sound Quality: Strangely lacking. Not sure how anything Neil could be involved with could have sort of a garage band reproduction quality.- Message: In an age of ""agree with the politicians or you hate the troops"" mentality, its nice to see someone that can speak up. Would actually be harder hitting if it were a bit more subtle. However, I rather loved the Bush quotes in ""Lets Impeach the President""."
3,Right in your face-A Wail of Rage,"Neil Young steps up with a musical bludgeon on Living With War. He's clearly not trying to be musically stylish and there is nothing subtle about the music or the message (sort of like war itself, I suppose). While on the one hand it is nice to see (and hear) musical protest again, the CD could have been better if was a little more subtle. I don't expect or want ""Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme"" out of Neil Young, but he was more believable and got his point across better with ""Keep on Rockin' in the Free World"" and his Freedom CD: He didn't bludgeon us then, and the message came across LOUD and clear!"
2,Big Fan but this falls short,"I'm a big Neil Young fan and have everything he's recorded so I was looking forward to this cd. I like the sentiment of the offering and lyrically this is right on the money but I think that most of the music is simplistic and mundane. I appreciate the inspiration but the music was written in 2 weeks and it sounds it. I wish he had taken two months. There are a few nice songs and most people will like ""Looking For a Leader"" but those moments are few and far between. ""Let's Impeach The President"" is especially tiring to listen to with Neil employing only a few chords over and over throughout. When I listen to this song, and several others, I find myself wanting to change notes and chords throughout just to break up the monoteny. And ending the CD with a miserable version of ""America The Beautiful"" is like a boring politician ending a speech with a high school band playing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" in order to get a standing ovation. Shameful."
2,Young rehashing Young,"Politics aside, most of the songs on here are not very original. As I listened to it, it seemed to me that Young was rehashing or recycling some of his earlier songs and licks. I think the only reason this CD got the press it did was because of the politics of the lyrics and Young flip-flopping on his earlier support of the war on terror (just like most of the Democrats). This is only for hardcore Young fans."
4,Everyone has an opinion,"Living With War (2006) is Neil Young's protest album - protesting the Bush administration's stance on certain things (war, obviously). With songs titles such as Living With War, The Restless Consumer, Shock And Awe, Families, Flags Of Freedom, Let's Impeach The President, and America The Beautiful, I think you get an idea of what to expect on this album. This isn't Neil Young's best work, no doubt about that, but the name of the game here is his powerful messages and strong opinions. This is an album where the lyrics are more important to Neil Young than the music is. If you're somebody who shares the same views as Neil Young and many other people out there in the world, then you'll love this album's lyrics. Remember - there's more emphasis on the lyrics and less emphasis on the quality of the music.The CD sleeve includes the lyrics to every song. Give this album a spin or two. No matter what your opinion is, let's remember to support our troops."
4,A great Niel young album,Living with war is an excellent album from Niel and marks a return to his rocking days with crazy horse.The music is certainly very good but I have taken off a star for the anti bush lyrics.
1,no title,"I am a huge Neil young fan, but I really get fed up with artists dealing in politics. This album is a very good example why.Typical of all liberals, he has all kinds of complaints, but no solutions. We are lucky to have as much free speech as we have. Neil, if you don't like the way our government is running our country and protecting our freedom (oh yeah, you had an album about that topic also) you can head right back to your home, Canada. Another example of a hypocrite making money off the war."
1,Neil Young is a dictator lover of big government,"I used to be a fan of Youngs with his passion to speak out against unjust causes but in regard to his misled belief that President Bush is the bad guy and Saddam is the good guy goes beyond belief. As Saddam hoodwinked the UN and the woosey Europeans Bush finally saw through it all and has taken the necessary steps to ensure a Madman and his sons could never take power with nuclear bombs. THis president is fighting two wars on two fronts against people who want to kill Americans and have wanted to since 1979. To take this album seriously is dangerous to America and simply a terrible piece. And I now have an excuse to through out every old Neil Young CD I ever owned. Neil, why not try to protest dictators and Muslim fanaticism and if his fans have a brain of their own they may see the US in a different light."
1,You gotta be kidding me?!,"I knew this would turn political, how could it not? To ""A Reader"", you are obviously one of the 30% who refuse to take off your blinders to look at the facts. It is not that hard. How sad to know that as American citizens we are no safer, getting ripped off more than ever by corporate fat cats, and that our boys are dying everyday because of a man with an 80 IQ. What does it take, ""A Reader""? Fortunately there are oldies like Neil Young who want to help educate the real world by shouting it out. Whether ""Living With War"" is quality work or not, Neil took the risk for all of us. As he said, ""I was waiting for the younger generation to step up and when I didn't see that happening, I realized I better take care of it myself."" Way to go, Mr. Young. I will gladly be purchasing your album this afternoon just to hear your version of the truth."
4,Viet Vet -- Still Living with War,"As a Viet Vet with PTSD, I am still living with war.This album speaks to me as a veteran for peace. I've seen war. War sucks.There are those that say politics has no place in the arts.Well, patriotic songs have existed probably as long as there have been nations -- and patriotism is as political as it gets.However, if a singer-songwriter takes a stance against a government position, some will try to say that politics have no place in art.As long as there are political causes, artists of all stripes will continue to write and sing songs that are political.Free speech also applies to artists in a democracy.So, just get over it.Z-Man, Phu Bai '69, Pleiku '70"
4,Great album from Niel,LIVING WITH WAR is one of the best albums from Niel and his best after Mirrorball and rust never sleeps.This great album is a return to his rocking albums and is very much unlike his sedate recent effort Praire wind.I bought this album a week back and still listen to it everyday.in all a solid effort from Niel who keeps going on and on.Highly recommended.
2,"Beyond politics, it's just not very good.","It's unfortunate that most of the reviews here seem to come down to either ""I agree with Neil's politics, so it's great"" or ""I disagree with Neil's politics, so it's awful."" Personally, because I agree with the politics, I was thrilled when it came out, and enjoyed listening to it the first few times, thinking ""you tell 'em Neil!"" I've always loved good protest songs--from Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Phil Ochs to the Clash, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, and Rage Against the Machine, and so was thrilled to see a return to the Neil Young of ""Ohio"" and ""Southern Man.""Subsequent listenings, however, revealed paint-by-numbers riffs and artless lyrics that are closer to what I'd expect to hear from strident, idealistic college students with guitars at political rallies (and, believe me, I've heard more than my share of them). Overall, much as I wanted to love it, I had to admit that it's one of his weakest efforts."
4,About time!!,"I love Neil Young and I love that he says well what most of us think about the situation in Iraq. He's amazing. The recording quality doesn't seem quite as good as ""Prairie Wind"" but the lyrics, heart and intent makes up for that."
2,He gets an extra star for bashing Bush. . .,". . .still, the music here is pretty bad. Pink's ""I'm Not Dead"" is a better political album."
1,Poor attempt at MUSIC - Bad political statement,"Neil young now falls in my category of great musical artists who have said too much. The enitre album sounds sounds exactly the same with kids in the chorus of every song. Neil should have stuck to what he did best, singing, not making political statements. How is this album a number one seller?"
1,Amusingly Daft...Needs To Concentrate on His Lionel Trains Collection,"Yeah...this one woulda gotten a point below ""0"" but the rating scale does go down that far!!!!!Whinny Whinny Whinny...chain saw guitars(Johnny Cunningham Mosrites Anyone?) and washed out COUNTRY JOE MCDONALD lyricsat its worst....C'mon Mr. Neil Have a sense of humor...or at least a bot 'o one in your old age!!!!This is one is a 'very warped' caricature of his old self and older music....too bad...but hey ""an ikon"" has still got's to be the 'pressing benchmark"" as one who is held in the ""esteem"" of being ""well beyond criticism.""I'd rather listen to Jon Auer's new disc (from The Posies Anytime-thanks you....)"
1,Go Back to Canada,"This is the United States, Neil. Yes, we do have the freemdom for you to make an uneducated CD like this. My suggestion is, if what we are doing is so bad...if fighting to rid the middle east of terrorists is so bad and offensive to you, go back to Canada and quit saying ""WE"" in your songs. Your not from this great country that is finally doing what past Presidents didn't the balls to do, and thats taking terrorists head on. Clinton sat back and let Bin Ladin get the resourses together to let 9/11 happen in the first place, why not go after him too. Bush isn't pushing for Bin Ladin right now because he is hiding in caves...Zarqawi was an active terrorist, who if You Mr. Young were President, would still be alive killing people today, so lets Impeach the songwriter who doesn't know what he's talking about. Go back to Canada."
1,2 points...,"1) Why is a non-citizen (who can't vote) attempting to lead a charge to impeach our president? Isn't becoming a citizen so he can actually make a difference the logical thing to do?2) After all these years, the lyrics still apply, ""A southern man don't need him around anyhow."""
1,I thought we were gonna roll?,"What's up, Neil? I thought we were gonna roll? You know, fight for freedom? I must have missed a memo. This cd is laughable - Country Joe and The Fish for the 21st century. Once you drive this lemon off the lot it's already depreciated considerably. In a couple months it will be as dated as that half gallon of milk that's been sitting in the back of your fridge. What pathetic about most of you Bush haters is how you will give 5 stars to anything that gives vent to your vile hatred of the president, regardless of the quality. Let's Impeach the President - what a pathetic, artless example of pettiness. Would a Dylan or a Springsteen resort to this pathetic, artless exercise even if they felt the exact same way. That's why Neil's in Triple A compared to those guys. But you can buy this glistening turd and build up Neil's bank account and pretend that your making a difference. As for me I'll be laughing at you the whole time. ;-)"
5,You Must Hear This CD,"Neil Young's ""Living With War"" CD speaks for every American who loves their contry but not the mess the current administration has made of it. The message in the lyrics speaks to all generations - my teenage grandchildren love it, as do my husband and I. We all can relate to his anger and need to speak out.The cuts ""Shock and Awe"" and ""Let's Impeach the President"" are radical but speak for many of us in our frustration and helplessness at the current state of the useless war in Iraq. On the other hand, the cuts ""Living with War"", ""Roger and Out"", and ""Flags of Freedom"" are touching and way, way too true.The final cut ""America"" is awesome and is a perfect ending to the CD.Every American should listen carefully to this CD. There is a strong message that must be heard."
3,Shock and Awe is a Great Song,"Say what you want about Neil Young. Say what you want about his latest political album Living With War. Say what you want about the anti-war lyrics on Track 4, Shock and Awe, but know this - it's a great song. It's a classic three chord, Crazy Horse special and it rocks. Period. Buy the disc for this song alone."
3,Neil Young rallies the youth and people against war with new album,"Neil Young never shied away from controversy. Altho he would tell you his music always comes first, his social consciousness has always been there in his music, whether it be about the environment, the inequities of life, pain and suffering, he writes from the heart. This war in Iraq should have already provoked a massive response from our population, however, it really has not! Neil appeals to our sense of responsibility to get involved, vote, maybe a black man, maybe a woman...whatever, get bloody involved in the process and stop this thing called war. The music was good but I found it hard to listen over and over again to something so intense. People need to hear it though."
5,Living With War Hits The Nail on the Head!,Good thing Neil Young keeps on rockin in the free world -- we need more folks like him to speak out - NOW more than ever.
1,Anger gets in the way of art,"There is plenty of music that I enjoy by artists that have different politics than my own, and there is plenty of music that I can say the same about. The difference with this one is after listening to the whole thing at least 5 times I just can't get past the feeling Neil was so angry and vitriolic he forgot to make decent music. Just because it's controversial and shocking does not mean it gets a pass on its other attributes. Bad is just bad. ""Let's Impeach the President"" sounds more like it was written at a bus stop in five minutes out of anger. Don't make the assumption that I'm a big Bush supporter and that is why I do not like this album. The cover is emblematic of how much time and effort seems to have been put into it's contents, it just stinks."
5,Living with War,Neil Young does not hold back. His most spirited album in years. A definate for his fans.
5,"Enthusiastically recommended especially for travelers, vacationers, and gourmets","Written by the founders of the consulting firm Prime Consultants, Edwin F. Jablonski and Barbara R. Wohlfahrt, Authoritative Revelations on Tipping is an in-depth guide to just how much to tip, when and where. From guidelines in how to act when leaving a tip, to precise means to deduce the proper tipping amount, to public attitudes and controversies about tipping, the history of tipping, and legal issues, Authoritative Revelations in Tipping covers it all. Enthusiastically recommended especially for travelers, vacationers, and gourmets who eat at fine restaurants, but also for anyone who is simply curious about how tipping really works."
1,Safety Concerns,"Pro:- The pieces are THICK.- Mirror polishCon:- Copper and steel lining has visible ""gap"". Which scared me as I read a review after my purchase (ChefMate copper bottom here at Amazon) that 2 people had the layers separated while cooking. Granted it's a different brand but I don't like the visible gap and don't want to experiment with safety- The handles are smooth and polished. No dents to help with grip. It's only a matter of time that you hold the pot with wet hand and have it slip off.- The omelet pan is not round. Near the handle are 2 dents near the handles. Because of the symmetry, some can argue it's designed that way. But it looked like a defect to me. The pan should be round or oval, not warped.Since I haven't used any piece yet, I'm returning this one."
5,Well Worth The Wait!,"Ms. Crombie's intelligent and thoughtful characters move through a vivid world presented with the perfect amount of detail and nuance. The author's writing is strong enough to transport readers right to London (and if they happen already to BE in London, then I'm guessing they're transported directly into whatever room the action is taking place). If you haven't read Crombie's work, begin with her first Kincaid/James novel and then move ahead. Crombie has created one of the most satisfying series I've ever run across -- and this book is a jewel!"
5,She's done it again!,"Teriffic story: well dilineated, likeable characters; clever interweaving plots; hard to put down. If this is the first of hers you've read it is a good stand-alone story, but gains depth if you have read the earlier ones. Kincaid and Jamea are very well developed, complex and likeable characters, Keep it up, Ms. Crombie!!"
5,Revenge that backfires,"We came into this series from the back end. Then purchase preceding works to catch up on the story line as the characters were compelling enough to warrant further reading. Deborah Crombie's Inspector's Kincard and James is such a pair. Their personal lives intermingle with their cases. As readers, we root for each installment. Her stories are keepers as we weed our shelves to make room for new favorites.With ""In a Dark House,"" Ms. Crombie apply demonstrates her ability to rank with Martha Grimes in creating the stark and brutal side of human relations. Knowing how the personal issues evolve, we concentrated on the deftly plotted case and the steps taken to reconstruct the crime from almost non-existent clues in this great police procedural.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
4,"two procedurals, two crimes, too many cooks in the kitchen","Let's see: Here's what cops do, here's what firefighters do, here's how good people get in each others' way. Plotted to a fault, but interesting nonetheless."
5,Birth of Surf,Both volumes are excellent compilations. Everything done by Ace Records is great! Be sure to purchase both Birth of Surf volumes.
4,Great if you travel/hike a lot,"Great if you hike in the areas with no water, or just travel and don't want to deal with mixing the powder. I wish the cans were smaller (4 oz for example) - as at first it was a waste to open a can when my daughter was only eating 4-5 oz. Otherwise t's great."
5,GREAT!!!!,"I love this! It is much better than the Two Towers or Felloship books. Why? Because I'm a pianist, and these solos are actually fun to play. The other two books are covered in my handwritten changes to the extent of looking like a Beethoven autograph. While I still make changes in ROTK, these are much better arranged for the pianist who enjoys playing."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"These Came extremely pitted and the edges are high on the dinging spoon. The case which wasn't a huge deal is flimsy, even compared to the few other chinese tool sets I own. The black paint rubs off on your hands, has bad runs, goes over the working surface in areas."
4,Secrets of success for puppy parents,"Great, practical tips on puppy rearing -- essential info especially for people who may not be experienced puppy parents. I have had dogs my whole life and am considering getting a new puppy and even for me I got some great ideas from this book which I will definitely use."
1,Dog ownership for the Control Freak,"I bought this book before getting our puppy. It seemed okay, but after getting our little dog, I realized that I could easily turn our darling, smart little dog into a neurotic mess if I followed the advice in this book. Why would you want to confine your brand new friend to a crate almost non-stop except for small intervals of extremely controlled interaction with you? And the point that he repeats incessantly about one housetraining mistake being a catastrophe is ridiculous. Our dog did have accidents when I wasn't as vigilant as I should have been, but now she is completely housetrained. It just takes time for the dog to physically mature and learn how to signal that she needs to go out. I would not reccomend this book at all. If you want to connect with your pup, go for clicker training."
5,Wow,"The title of my review says it all. I really really was blown away by this film. I wish they had a little more money, but it is so unique that it makes up for the budget. A must see! I want to say more, but do not want to ruin it. Every teacher should see this movie."
4,All abaout VINs but not a buyers guide,"This is a good book, but far from a buyers giude. It tells all about VINs, colours of the cars interior and exterior vith some pictures,... But if you think this book will tell you somthing about some important weekneses of the cars, what to look out for when buying it, which cars to stay away from, you will need another book. But a good look into what's out there and a few facts about all the cars."
1,The most boring album ever made.,"Is this a joke? Where is Depeche Mode? Nothing about this cd resembles anything like what they've done before. While some people will call this ""a triumph"" I call it dreadful. The beats are undermixed to the point of non-existence. The guitar is amateurish and cheesy. The singing is uninspired and monotonous. The instrumentation is so subtle there may as well not be any. Produced by Mark Bell of LFO (on warp) & Bjork fame, I expected an extravaganza of electronica with cool beats, dynamic synthesisers and exciting vocals. This album contains none of those elements. A lazy excuse for an album. I miss Depeche Mode and this cd makes me miss them even more."
1,*Yawn*,Don't get me wrong - there's a lot of Depeche Mode that I really like. But - and this is a big one - this disc is slow and moody. I greatly prefer the higher-octane stuff. This one gets donated to the public library. Look for it there.
1,boringly disappointing,"I can't figure out what all these rave reviews are about. With the exception of the catchy first track,this album is trite,flat and exceedingly boring. I gave this album several repeat listenings over the course of a week to no avail. My disappointment increased with each repeat. Blah. I enjoyed the industrial sonic hum of Songs of Faith and Devotion and was expecting more of the same....not so with this. The 80's are over and out."
2,DM used to be very good,"I thought that DM key members were David Gahan and Martin Gore. Martin wrote it, Dave sang it. After listening to Exciter i think the key member was Alan Wilder, because DM began sound classic DM since 1983 - first album with Alan Wilder and their last great album was SOFAD - last album with Alan Wilder. It's pretty clear that the trademark DM sound was done by him. Just listen to his solo albums - under his project name RECOIL-especially album UNSOUND METHODS, it's real follow-up to SOFAD. THe problem of Exciter is that it lacks in production, has no memorable melodies (even ULTRA had some) - i mean music melodies, not vocal melodies. Those great synth melodies are gone. If you remove Gahan vocal, you will not recognize that this is DM, because music is ordinary and non DM, Wilder made it sound DM. Thanks"
5,Best DM cd since Violator...,"The trademark keyboard-synth sound is no more, but DM comes back with their best work since Violator. Bass-heavy, muted tracks are the backdrop, while David Gahan's vocals are in fine form.That being said, it's not like Violator, Music for the Masses, or even the awful Songs of Faith and Devotion. It's a new sound for DM, and I like it."
3,Exciter isnt THAT exciting,"Alright, i know depeche mode has been around for some 20 years now. This is their first album in four years, and it sounds very mellow, and at times hard to tell apart from their other songs. There are some good tracks on here, but Exciter is probably not the word i would use to describe this album. They go into different areas of music, going places where people their age wouldnt want to go, but it sounds like they've matured and has a more mature feel to it. This is because they have gotten older. Unlike U2 though, they havent totally tried to recreate their image. i dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing. This is definately an album for Depeche fans, and a couple of the tracks are worth checking out even if you arent. Be sure to check out my other reviews! thanks."
4,Not a letdown!,"Maybe I'm a bit biased here, but I think ""Exciter"" is a good album. It is way more consistent than ""Ultra""--not to say that there aren't standout tracks on ""Ultra"". My favorites on ""Exciter"" have to be ""Shine"", ""I Feel Loved"", and ""I Am You"". Just like they proved they could do it without Vince Clarke, they have proven that they can make good records without the musical chops of Alan Wilder. I'm very pleased with ""Exciter""."
2,"Not the best, (maybe) not the worst","I'm sad to say Depeche Mode now sounds like their cover bands. The music has little texture, and most of the songs sound like demos (e.g. 'Dream On'). I think tracks off 'Construction Time Again' and 'Some Great Reward' had much more musical (and surprisingly lyrical) depth. The lyrics also reach an all-time low on this album. Having been a fan since 1988, I must say I'm disappointed, though the album isn't entirely without merit. (Also bear in mind that I really liked 'Ultra.')Hopefully they will play older songs on their tour!"
4,Exciter Exquisite,"Top to bottom...this is great CD. ""I Feel Love"" is a great club track (play it loud and let the synths do the rest) Not to mention the full gamut of tracks ranging from ""Freelove"" to ""Shine"" then ""Dead Of Night"". The music industry is weak - this is excellent spirit material in a sad day for popular music. The band has come up with some very creepy sounds and weirded me out once again - I LOVE IT! I can only hope they will do it again sooner and not wait 3+ years next time. DM lyrics speaks truth..........LISTEN!"
2,Don't believe the hype,"I will agree to disagree with the majority of negative reviews regarding this album, in that this isn't a horrible album. However, it is extremely lacking in what has become the past power of Depeche Mode.There are few, if many memorable, hooks. While the production is sound, the entire album drones on sleepily for nearly 57 minutes. I am quite disappointed in this effort and regret shelling out the bucks for it.No doubt, if you are a Depeche Mode fan, you have probably bought this album. While still beautifully poetic in its lyrics, it is certainly lacking in depth."
5,Wow! Truely the best - nah even better than Violator,At first listen I thought it was OK but after the second listen I was hooked. The lyrics are the best I have heard out of Martin Gore. I agree with the critic who said that David's voice is back and better than ever. He is back in true form. The music has a maturity and a sensuality shows their ever increasing talents. They have really outdone themselves.It was worth the wait!
3,Good Album...but a step down.,"I've been a Depeche Mode fan for a long time, and since 97 I've been anticipating their return,not sure if they were going to top 97's ULTRA. They didn't.There are some really great tracks on this album...""Dream On"";""Shine"";""I Am You"" and ""Goodnight Lovers"" are the best ones for me. Some tracks are ""hard"" to listen to in my opinion.. ""The Sweetest Condition"" and ""The Dead of Night"" seem to be..at first..auckward, after a while there not so bad. I expected smoother songs sung by Martin..they seem goofy..not powerful like past songs. If your a fan and can take a weird change from these guys go ahead and buy this album..I like it more every time I play it...I'm just glad they didn't give up!"
4,Listen to it more than once,"First off, I'd like to say that many of the reviews I've read so far seem too hasty concerning this album. ""Exciter"" is DM's deepest album to date and Martin Gore's songwriting is as awesome as it always has been. This album doesn't grab you right from the start, but if you listen to it a while, you will eventually come around. I think quite a few of these people were hoping for another ""Violator"", but come on everybody; a band has to progress in order to stay fresh. If you give it a chance, you'll be able to experience some truly beautiful music..."
2,Not done yet,"While this CD starts out well, after the first two tracks, it's pretty painful to listen to. Some Interesting ideas, but too many of the songs are just missing so much of what makes Depeche Mode so good. Plus there are a couple of songs, that sound like they just needed to add a few songs.I waited so long for this album, and especially after hearing Dream On, I had high expectations. But now this CD is back in its case, and will probably be there for a while."
2,"Monotonous, yet still rather hypnotic","Unlike most critics it seems, I really liked Depeche Mode's previous releases ""Ultra"" and ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"". Their hyperkinetic melodrama had a theatricality that seemed bold and exciting. With their latest release, ""Exciter"", DM has gone back twelve years and revisits their sounds of ""Violator"". With the exception of the opening track ""Dream On"", the vampirish ""Dead of Night"", and the electronic rave ""I Feel Loved"", ""Exciter"" doesn't excite. David Kahane's voice merely grates and plaintively groans over synthesized noise that is neither melodic nor particularly inspired.This album, however,is not a total lost cause. The tracks mentioned above have an urgency that keeps you coming back to hear more ... and while overall the album has a monotonous feel, there is something hypnotic to it all. I continue to listen even while realizing it isn't very good, yet I cannot seem to pull myself away.I suppose there's something in that."
4,Not for the masses...,"The first thing you have to be clear is that times change, and music and people change. Don't try to compare old 1980's or 1990's DM's albums with this, that it's a totally waste of time. Exciter by itself it's a great album, loaded with deep and dark sounds and emotive lyrics. It's not an easy listening album, you have to try it twice or maybe more, but I'm sure that at the end you'll just love it. DM it's on the top of it's career, the album it's strong, mature and honest and every song has a thin line that conects you to the next one.DM it's not anymore a band for the masses, thanks god! So if you feel in a chill mood and looking for some interesting new music, this is the option, an old band making great new music for this decade."
3,Good Surprise!!,"Well... I bought depeche mode cd today, didn't know if it will be good or not, i've never been a fan so I took a chance. What a good surprise when i listen to it. I must admit that the first time I wasn't sure if I love it or not. I listen to it a second time and then, I said to myself what a great album!! Songs like Freelove, Comatose, The Dead of Night are my personal fav! A great variation of sound, it's not always the same beat from beginning 'til the end and best thing among all it's not commercial, well.. i'm loving pop but sometimes it's great to listen to something you don't hear on radio or TV. I gave 3 stars just because I think that voice of David is on second plan, they put music in front so I think it a lack from this cd.Good Album to add to your collection, you won't be disappointed!"
4,worth the purchase,"I had not bought this until after I saw them in concert. What a great CD especially ""Dead of Night"" that song sends chills. If they are coming anywhere near you GO SEE THEM!! The show was beyond words. I am glad they have withstood the test of time and have really carved out a niche for themselves that no one else can even come close to."
5,Tendereness,"Pretty unusual feeling about this album. Each track seems close to precedents but finally they're are really brand new with a sound I've never heard from them. The emotionality which was ""on the surface"" now seems hidden you every listener can found it in him/herself rather than in the music. Great album. I' am eager to see them playing a gig."
3,"Solid, but not groundbreaking.","I guess it would be cruel to expect every band's album to be as good or better than their past efforts. Creating works of art is a difficult thing, and I would definitely think of Depeche Mode as a group of artists. With that said, I would have to label ""Exciter"" as a solid album that I'm not unhappy to own. However, it didn't create the type of experience I had the first time I listened to Moby's ""Play"" or Massive Attack's ""Mezzanine"". As a fan since 1984, maybe I've just grown too comfortable with DM and this album didn't 'wow' me because of that familiarity. ""Exciter"" is solid effort that proves DM is alive and kicking, but I won't be shouting from the rooftops about it."
2,Uninspired with a few gems,"Sometimes it's better for bands not to release an album for a while. This is a perfect example of that. Two or three decent tracks, and for the first time in DM history there are filler songs. From what I hear of Playing the Angel, I will be rating that one with 5 stars, but sadly Exciter falls flat."
4,Truly an Exciter,"Depeche Mode's ""Exciter"" continues their run as royalty to their signature synthesizer music. They stay unique in their musical style after almost twenty years. They prove on this album that they can still entertain audiences as they did in the beginning. Their fast paced songs are edgy and catchy, which are sung by Dave Gahan. His voice remains unmisidentifiable. Their ballads are beautifully sung by guitarist Martin Gore. Every lyric on this album is written and sung from the heart. They begin this album with the catchy dance hit single ""Dream On"". This introduces the listeners to what's about to come. Other stand-out tracks include ""The Dead of Night"" and the two-time Grammy nominated ""I Feel Love"". ""Exciter"" is a great album for those looking for great synthesizer music. This will surely please many listeners."
1,Depeche (in an uncreative) Mode,"No one was looking forward to this album more than I was. I have just finished listening to the CD from beginning to end and I can think of only one word--""Uninspired!"" There is not one song on this album that I wish to hear again. In the past, DM has provided solid music with variety. ""Ultra"" was such a promising return to the scene from a group that had been silent for years. From the gritty ""Barrel of a gun"" to the solemn tone of ""Home"", ""Ultra"" truly delivered. But the music in this recent offering was colorless, leaving the listener with a flavor reminiscent of trading card gum!"
3,Has an unfinished sound,"After listening to this CD a couple of times, I felt as if I missed something. It is not a bad CD, but it seems that ""Exciter"" does'nt live up to it's potential. I liked some of the tracks but this was no ""Ultra"". Some of the lyrics were pretty good but others sounded like a 14 year old wrote them for his poetry class. I guess that my expectations were too high."
3,"People - Violator can't be made again, ok?","Everyone takes a CD like this and immediately compares it to the bans's finest hour. Well, that really isn't fair is it? Times have changed as have styles in music. So, Exciter is not Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, or Violator. It is also not 1988 anymore.Exciter, by itself, stands as a very melodic string of music that is quite listenable. Gore and Gahan still prove to be a great duo. After listening to this CD about 5 times through, I can say that I like it. Old fans will be dissapointed. This is not intro to Mode. Buy one of the aforementioned CD's if you want to know what they were back in the day.All in all, not too bad even if it lacks pipe-clanging."
3,A return to Violator,"It was Ultra that got into DM - what I liked about it was its darkness and slightly more industrial feel. Exciter has a cleanliness reminiscent of Violator, but is more up-beat. I have to say, though, that none of the songs on Exciter strikes me as being as well-constructed as those on Violator."
2,ULTRA II,"I was anxiously waiting for DM's new cd. After Ultra, I figured anything would be an improvement. I got Ultra II! Most of the songs here are uninspiring, save for one or two. I've been waiting 14 years for DM to make a good album, and I'll have to keep waiting. In the meantime, it's back to listening to early 80's DM."
1,I should have bought Tool!,"I hate to write such negative review after having the disc a mere 8 hours, but I can't help it. This CD is awful. I have been a big Depeche Mode fan for years and must say this cd is no where near the quality of which they are capable of. Basically, what you have heard on the radio is about as good as it gets, the rest of the cd is just crap. Buy Music for the Masses or Black Celebration if you want good DM, but DO NOT waste your money on this one."
2,Not There....,"Lionell Richie meets Depeche Mode's Violator.That about sums it up.The album needs a drive or a pulse to keep it moving along. The synth work and production work is excellent, however, the depressing and over-the-top lyrics we've all come to expect from Depeche Mode have been wiped. The music doesn't overcome this, and you're stuck with ... less bucks in the bank account for a CD that does not live up to expectations."
2,Not excited...,"After Violator, SOFAD and Ultra I was keen to see what direction Depeche Mode would progress - but this album feels like something with all the life drained out of it. I just couldn't get enthusiastic about it at all. I think they just got lazy with the songwriting, personally."
2,Sign of Creativity Slump,"I read once that Martin Gore had a serious case of writer's block when creating songs for Exciter, and you know what? It shows. This album is full of lyrical retreads Sweetest Condition= Sweetest Perfection, Shine= One Caress, and Breathe= Things You've Said. In addition, the lyrics are trite as shown with When the Body Speaks. Musically, Exciter lacks edge. The musical arrangements are flat and bland. There are no dynamics, texture to the songs. In a word, boring."
1,a let down,"COMPLETELY lacking of the wonderful melodies, lyrics and hooks of most of DM's work. I can only hope their next album is better."
2,A HUGE disappointment,"Unlike several other reviewers, I very much like the direction the band's been taking recently -- UNTIL THIS. Their prior two albums (""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" and ""Ultra""), may not contain very much in the way of catchy hooks, but each has exquisite songwriting and an ability to grow on the listener like a sweet addiction. However, this album contains nothing of the sort. It's just plain bad, and excruciatingly boring. Except maybe for the first track, none of the songs go anywhere. And after about 15 minutes of listening to one dull, depressing, uninspired track after another, you honestly begin to wonder whether Martin Gore has picked up heroin where Dave Gahan left off. In a nutshell -- and as someone else said in their review -- if you really feel the need to have this album, wait until it hits the used CD rack. Because the supply there should be plentiful. God, I sure hope they don't play this junk when I see them in concert next month...."
1,Brutal,"This is the most brutal CD I have ever bought, I hope I can get some money for this at the used record store. Most of the songs sound like a 9 year old playing with a synthesizer he/she just got for Christmas. Brutal"
2,In the bottom of my list,"I rushed to buy this album the first day it came out (like many of you). I listened to it several times, let it rest , came back to it again and it simply doesnt grow on you. The sound is flat, it doesnt offer anything new much worse it lets you wishing for the old DM albums. The songs 'Shine' ''Freelove' and 'I feel loved' save this album from being a major dissapointment.'The Dead of the Night' is the worst song ive heard from this group, i skip it (something i never do with DM albums). After such a brilliant album like ULTRA im amazed they came up with this tracks, i still wonder what happened . This goes way in the bottom of my DM album list(being all five and four stars this one is a two). Still is an album every DM mode fan should have and buy."
1,Weakest Depeche Mode Album,"This album was such a disappointment to me. I have seen many reviews exalting this album but I am damn sure that each review of that kind comes from a die-hard DM fan. I used to be a great DM fan. Today I have settled down and am more unbiased towards the bands I used to be crazy about. I only buy an album if it's really good. As for Exciter, the album will remain on the shelves.Depeche Mode really feels the lack of Alan Wilder into the mix. The songs are not melody-friendly and there are no intelligent smart tunes like in ""Policy Of Truth"", ""Freestate"" or ""I Feel You"" and many others. It's difficult to digest this album if you come from the days of Music for the Masses and Violator.The only two songs worth in this album are ""Dream On"" and ""I Feel Loved"", the rest just brings that strange cold feeling to your stomach that Depeche Mode is not the same it used to be. It's an album that reflects the lack of direction that the band is struggling with."
