3,A brilliant start...,"If i divide this novel into 2 , i would give 5 stars to the first half , and just one star to the second. The book had such an interesting begining and a plot that got me so absorbed in its details,i couldn't wait for it to unfold. Unfortunately the ending was very poor ....."
3,Too much work,"This book shone at times, but for the most part (~90% of the time) it was a chore to read."
3,Where's the Ambiguity?,"This last Le Carre novel is a great disappointment. Having read so many of his previous books, I so missed the moral ambiguity that was at the heart of them. There are times in this novel when you see flashes of the old Le Carre, but they only make you shake your head and wonder why he has gone down on this path of lecturing readers on right and wrong. Granted, the international drug companies are lousy - in the sense that their much needed drugs are unafforable to most of Africa - but this kind of lecturing is not what people buy Le Carre for....we buy his books for these flawed characters who, in their heart of hearts, know that in most of the murky world, there is not that much that separates the good from the bad. George Smiley knew that about Karla. Why has John Le Carre forgotten it?"
4,Even a lesser Le Carre is pretty great...,"Well, I suppose I feel that something slipped here. I'm not one that believes that his best work ended with the fall of The Wall (Single & Single is excellent), but there's a certain ... diffusion ... here that doesn't work for me.The first half of the novel is excellent, but as Justin moves forward, it loses focus and steam. The character becomes frozen, unlike the best Le Carre characters, who develop right up to the end.Perhaps I'm just disappointed. It's still an excellent book, and the first half had the makings of one of his best. But that promise is not fulfilled."
3,The Constant Gardener,"John LeCarre writes about the evils of the pharmaceutical companies in The Constant Gardner.Yet, his glum characterization of the Kenyan government is no better than his vilification of corporate greed. For instance, he reinforces negative stereotypes of African governments in the book; they are all corrupt and dysfunctional. Moreover, he paints an acerbic view of the Kenya government under the Moi administration in the first few chapters; nothing or nobody association with the establishment is any good. When I taught in Kenya during the Moi administration, I did not find this to be the case. Do not get me wrong, corruption existed in Kenya. However, it did not permeate every aspect of the government as suggested in the paperback that I read. Moreover, even in fiction the author has some responsibility to be historical accurate."
5,Le Carre In Top Form,"This is the fascinating story of a man trying to learn what happened to his murdered wife, whose death is tied to the deadly use of an imperfect drug, which a pharmaceutical company, run by an unscrupulous CEO, is testing in Africa. In contrast to some le Carre novels, this is a tightly calibrated narrative that moves quickly and without pomposity. The meetings between the protagonist, Justin Quayle, and some devious bureaucrats in the foreign office are a mid-book high point. The last chapter is also great. There, the protagonist's sad adventures suddenly appear as the heartbreaking quest of a husband with suicidal survivor's guilt. In this chapter, the harsh world rewards the forces of good, but only ironically. Highly recommended."
4,Film-Making and Story-Telling at Its Best,"Deserving of all accolades it's gotten, and deserving of more than one Oscar nomination. Heartbreaking in the same way that Hotel Rwanda was."
5,A courageous novel,The Constant Gardner is not just a churning tale of love and loss but it is also a very courageous book about large corporations sometimes unethical behavior. So in a sense it is a political book as well and John Le Carre does not mind taking side.
4,A beautiful but troubled read,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Constant Gardener, but was also troubled by it. I haven't read any more of the author's writing, but think that the plot was somewhat held back by the descriptions. To me, The Constant Gardener is a reverse-Hemingway of sorts. The language is almost too flowery. Nonetheless, it is a unique story and very well written work of fiction."
3,Intriguing but Overwritten,"Where were the author's editors?? This intriguing novel, the subject of which will be near and dear to liberal hearts everywhere, is nevertheless overwritten in exacerbatingly prolix style. The sympathetic story suffers from tedious diatribes against the pharmaceutical companies (he is preaching to the converted!)when a more detailed explanation of characterization and motive would have sufficed. Still, it's worth the time, if just for the spot-on, scathing descriptions of the pathetically displaced (in both time and place) British diplomatic personnel."
3,Well Written but Too Left Wing!,"As a loyal Le Carre reader, I was disappointed by his cliched anti-Parmaceutical industry, anti-Big Business bias in this novel. Le Carre is usually so much better at seeing the shades of grey in various issues. Here he falls into left-wing claptrap! I still give it three stars because it IS well-written and iss engaging even when you have to grit your teeth at the ""little peole = good; business = THE (evil) MAN"""
3,The Constant Le Carre,"I must admit that I wouldn't have enjoyed this at all if the author's name were not John Le Carre. The writing and characterization are vintage le Carre but the plot about evil multinational pharmaceutical giants and conspiracy left me cold and wondering if it were more suited to perhaps a novel by Robert Ludlum? I look forward to Le Carre's new books because characters, plot and dialogue and emotion in his books always rang so true. The Constant Gardener delivers on these aspects (Le Carre certainly wears his emotions on his sleeve, for all readers to see) but the one dimensional pharmaceutical giant as villain stretches credulity quite a bit."
2,garden intruder,"Having enjoyed every one of LeCarre's previous novels, I was left unprepared for the disappointment of this novel. In The Constant Gardener, Le Carre at last has found the courage to stand up for a cause. How satisfying for him personally, but how stultifying for his art. Characterization, usually one of LeCarre's strong suits, is particularly weak in this novel. The few characters who are not 2-dimensional paste-ups - the villain Lorbeer for instance - are more muddled than psychologically complex. The language is generally less rich than usual, replaced with a rather conventional attention to the details of a shallow plot. If you're new to LeCarre, bury this weed and make room for his fine perennials."
2,Disappointing,"The Constant Gardener is a 500 page story about a man's quest to uncover the (not so mysterious) mysteries revolving around his late wife's research into an evil pharmaceutical company and her subsequent murder. It really did not live up to it's billing as a thrilling tale. It definitely did have a feel to it, though, typical of many fiction novels these days: an elegantly written bleak and depressing story.Most of the ""action"" that takes place occurs within the endless conversations between various characters on the same subject, which makes for a slow pace. Are there good moments of intrigue and drama? Yes . . . but, oh so few! The ending of the book was especially unsatisfying.Please also be advised that Le Carre likes to do a lot of preaching through the words of his characters against the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately, it would seem, against capitalism.For someone like me who reads fiction for entertainment and escape, this was unfortunately not a good choice."
1,Disappointed,Having read some of Mr Le Carre's previous work I was expecting more than this. I felt so disappointed and let down. If Mr. Le Carre wanted to go on a personal crusade against the white exploitaiton of black Africa let him do it as a newspaper article and not make me fork out my hard earned cash on an insipid book. The characters are so flat and unappealing and the language is olde worlde to say the least. Please take my advice and do not waste your hard earned cash on this bookSorry Mr. Le Carre but I cannot tell a lie.
2,Le Carre's Pen Should Have Run Out of Ink,"This book goes on way too long, about 200 pages too long. If the author were not LeCarre, this book would never have been published."
2,"Boring, boring","Unfortunately, I really looked forward to this book, but I could not muster up any interest in this book. I also couldn't care less about who killed ""Tessa!"" Way too slow and draggy for my interests."
2,Not a feel-good experience,"This was my first Le Carre book, and likely my last. If you're in the mood for an honest by hopeful message, this book isn't for you. The dangers of the drug industry, the British foreign service, trusting seemingly good people--it was more gloom than I could stand. I came away feeling as if I'd swallowed a mouthful of dirt, rocks and all."
1,Constant and poor gardener,"Poor English - boringly written story - two times too long. After not having finished the ""Taylor of Panama"" I shall NEVER touch a book by Le Carr√© again. Sorry for having wasted my time."
5,An emotionally powerful new novel from John le Carre,"Too often a commercially successful novelist -- especially one identified with a particular genre -- falls into the easy routine of writing in essence the same book over and over again or, at best, cutting corners to quickly finsh off yet another manuscript to be shipped off to the printer in time for the annual publication date. But that is not John le Carre. His work almost always shows a progression in his exploration of theme and technique. Certainly there are echoes of his most recent works from ""Our Game"" through ""Single & Single"", but in ""The Constant Gardener"" we are drawn even more deeply into an identification with the central character during his lonely odyssey. I cannot imagine how anyone could read this novel without being strongly emotionally affected."
2,"After a long and frustrating wrestling, the penny dropped...","A third or so through this book I suddenly realised what it was about John Le Carre's books; yes, the situations he sets out are certainly interesting, but...he simply can't conjure up believeable characters! It must have been that we simply didn't notice in the Cold War novels.The very poor (and at times risible) stuff his protagonists come out with in ""The Perfect Gardener"" is, in fact, representative of his oeuvre. Too much of what his characters come out with is embarrassingly implausible, and worthy of Ian Fleming at his most imbecilic rather than, say, an on-form Graham Greene (who at other times shares Le Carre's inability to breath real, sustained life into his 'dramatis personae').In short, this book - long on didactics but woefully short of weight, or prolonged entertainment value - is not even, in my view, worth packing in your holiday suitcase for the undemanding environs of the pool."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I am a relatively normal, i hope, 58 year old, happily married professional man. I have loved the earlier novels by Le Carre. This one is beautifully written, but boring as sin.I mean, the gal gets murdered on page 40 or less, and the next 400 pages get more and more boring.Great style, no story of interest.I tried and tried and tried to like it.I want my money back.Give it up John, take up gardening for good."
3,The Constant Garner,"John LeCarre writes about the evils of the pharmaceutical companies in The Constant Gardner.Yet, his glum characterization of the Kenyan government is no better than his vilification of corporate greed. For instance, he reinforces negative stereotypes of African governments in the book; they are all corrupt and dysfunctional. Moreover, he paints an acerbic view of the Kenya government under the Moi administration in the first few chapters; nothing or nobody association with the establishment is any good. When I taught in Kenya during the Moi administration, I did not find this to be the case. Do not get me wrong, corruption existed in Kenya. However, it did not permeate every aspect of the government as suggested in the paperback that I read. Moreover, even in fiction the author has some responsibility to be historical accurate."
3,A Book Without An Ending,"Le Carre is an excellent writer, but every once in a while he messes up a book by failing to conclude an outcome. This is one where the husband, Justin Quayle, of the heroine, Tessa, manages to clear her good name and a fellow researcher, Bluhm, who have been hot on the trail of a dishonest pharmaceutical company who murdered both of them. Justin has uncovered this dastardly deed, but having done so, it is not clear what Justin's next move is or should be. Was he just satisfying himself about the integrity of his wife and her research colleague or the dishonesty of the KVH Drug Company? Maybe Le Carre ran out of ideas of how to end his novel. It would not be the first time."
2,This is John Le Carre???,One would not normally pick up a John Le Carre novel to be schooled in third world socio-economics but that's about all you get here. Perhaps in his advancing age Le Carre wants to write the great novel instead of just entertaining us. I perfer entertainment and when its time to learn about Africa I can pick up a tightly focused analysis of the issues.
2,Not Much Action,"This Book is a long, hard, flash-back laden slog. Along the way, le Carre offers some interesting observations about the internatial phameceutical industry and African culture. But the book never really overcomes the self-inflicted disadvantage le Carre imposed by killing off the most interesting characters before the opening scene. And the incessant flashbacks become a major annoyance that sucks the life out ouf what plot there is. Whenever things finally do get a bit interesting, we're zapped to another time and place and are left to learn what happened only in bland retrospect.Give me more present tense, more action, and more suspense. Give me Tom Clancy."
3,LeCarre in a hurry to finish?,"After not having read a good book in awhile I was impressed with a review I read and began my quest to read LeCarre. I was immediately immersed in LeCarre's characters and caught up in his plot. As I neared the conclusion of the novel,...four chapters to go...I thought to myself there are too many loose ends to tie up here. Then all of a sudden it was if LeCarre got bored with writing the book and rushed to finish writing the book instead of continuing on the path that he had so intricately woven in the first half of the book. A big letdown. Overall though the book was well written but if your not into epics with ho-hum endings I would pass on this one."
1,A tedious novel,"To cut a long long long and monumentally boring story short, the novel is tedious. While in the early parts it has some promise of interesting things to come, it becomes confused, hard to read and exceptionally slow. It is almost as unreadable as some of the Booker Prize Winners. It was quite a torture for me to labour through to the end. It is an extremely disappointing work of the author of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."
3,More a Polemic than a Novel,"Very nicely written thriller, with wonderful characterizations (Justin, Ghita, and Tessa - unfortunately, mostly offstage) and the inevitable spook (with his advanced mishealth perhaps a metaphor for the current state of the British intelligence services). But - do not read further if you haven't read the book - I found the ending unsatisfactory and ultimately frustrating as Justin's death leaves a lot of loose ends - not least of which is Three Bee's antagonists still running rampant over sub-Saharan Africa. Plus you wonder why this intelligent fellow more or less presents himself to his enemies on a silver platter when the war has barely started. Is the message that the pharmas are still out there? If the answer is yes, then the book is less of a novel and more of an anti-pharmaceutical pamphlet - and is the worse for it."
2,The most overestimated le Carre novel,I have read a great deal of le Carre. This one is a big opportunity cost - it is much better to read his other stuff. The Constant Gardener is rather well written but too much sentimental and idealistic. In the end the book bored me too - everything was clear but somehow the author had to spend a lot of his (and yours) time on description of new characters and landscapes. It should be considered a good book but not for le Carre
1,Sick,"Stick figures and a Snidely-Whiplash villain, Big Pharmacology. Mr Cornwell clearly lost the Cold War and hasn't found a role.This book did bring back memories, however. Only yesterday, it seems, there was talk that Salk or Sabin had unloaded bad polio vaccine on sub-Saharan Africa, and had ignited AIDS. That talk was apparently as inconsequential as this book."
2,LE CARRE TUMBLES OFF HIS BRAND NAME PEDESTAL,"Le Carre is a brand name that sold lots of books during the cold war .But ever since then, the brand has plunged downmarket in search of an audience .The latest Le Carre is certainly the clunkiest. Poorly plotted,clumsily written ( at times one detects a number of hands at work , including some amateur British ones), the Constant Gardener takes a ride on the proposition that global corporations are evil .But Brits know little about the operations of global business.This Le Carre brand is getting closer and closer to a post-Cold War James Bond in search of an idea. The Le Carre name may make the best seller list , based on orders from libraries .But don't bother buying the book .Its just amateur night by Brits in search of an audience."
2,"Slipping, slipping.............","Simply, this is not a very good book. Certainly not up to what one would expect from an author of Le Carre's standing. The book begins well, dies in the middle ( I thought I would never get through the never ending correspondence), and ends up in a short blaze of activity that is not done well. The book seems more a crusade againt the pharmaceutical industry than a story line about the adventures of his characters. It is an angry book. Le Carre still knows the art of the sentence as well as any contemporary author. The fact is that he can write a much better book than this. He always has in the past."
3,Colonial Hangover and Corporate Greed,"Not LeCarre's best, but still a pretty fair read - thoughtful, well paced, intelligent. The usual mixture of social commentary is a little too heavy perhaps - the evil pharmaceutical companies bleeding cash out of the miserable third world poor, mixed in with a bad British colonial hangover (the hollow British aristocracy hangers-on still hoping for a knighthood - damn the natives). LeCarre can still tell a story with the best of them, but his literary skills are not as sharp here. The ending is not right by his standards either."
4,Intriguing story,John leCarre writes a masterful and intriguing story that opens up the concerns of marketing practices of pharmacology companies. Tessa Qualye becomes an advocate who sees the injustice and tries to expose this but is killed before she can deliver the blow. le Carre employs an intricate system of deception and allows you to understand the motives behind all of the characters in his plot. I found the story was well researched and very readable. I can't wait to see the movie.
3,Magnificent style as always,"The language, descriptions and scenes are wonderful as Le Carre always is. John Grisham has said that he aspires to Le Carre's style. You can see here why he might indeed.The serpent in this garden is that as a naive and sentimental reader I want true love to conquer all, goodness to be victorious and the hero and heroine to walk off into the sunset together. Which is a tad problematic here. 'Nuff said. (This is a Le Carre; what am I thinking; but I stick by my reader's demand)."
2,Disappointing and rough going...,"I'm a Le Carre fan from Cold War days and admit to having downed most of his books with enthusiasm. This one was a rough ride, however. Good concept, interesting theme (big bad pharmas against the little people) but somewhat disjointed delivery and a tremendous amount of British-style language filler that made reading a chore...for a Yank anyway. Not a page turner by any stretch. Sorry John.Out in the cold..."
2,"Interesting story, poorly written","I saw the film based on this book and wanted to know more, so I read the book. It does offer more detail then the film, but the writing is so bad! The characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways inconsistent with their previous actions and the author's descriptions of them. The author re-uses cliche phrases and metaphors throughout. Some of the sentences don't even make sense. The author's treatment of dialogues in foreign languages is painfully clumsy. Great story, but had I not seen the film I wouldn't have cared enough about the characters to keep reading."
2,a novel reworked as a polemic,"Nothing wrong with polemics if you agree with the point of view of the polemicist... And, nobody seems to have picked up on the similarity of this book to Small Town in Germany, even down to the voluntary crucifixion of the hero at the end. The background and local color are informative and tend to reinforce the impression that Africa may not be a nice place to live but I wouldn't want to visit there."
3,Decent - but depressing,"I found this book good. However, it is too true to lifeto be entertainment. A heavy dose of cynicism is therethroughout the book. It is full of action, but might makeyou depressed by the end of it.His characterizations are the best I've ever read though."
5,Le Carre back on track,"After a few slightly lackluster novels, it is great to see LeCarre back. I am glad to see him tackle current villains of the world with his usual sardonic wit."
2,not oem,"the sound stage was ok,i used for about 60 days and then i stepped up and bought the grado black!"
1,Perfume,"Jean-Michelle Milano PerfumeJean-Michelle Milano PerfumeProduct listed at $35.00 but on their web site they had it priced on sale for $10.00 which didn't make this gift very worthwhile as far as I'm concerned. Plus you have to become a member to order from their web site even though this was a gift that I ordered from someones wish list and not for me personally, therefor I had to pay the higher price and the item was received not in the best shape."
5,"Full of interesting, disgusting facts but you won't throw up","This book is full of disgusting, yet interesting facts about digestion. It has cool cartoons, crazy quizzes, and lots of intriguing scientific words. It will make you giggle and soon you will be using some of those cool scientific words. I'd recommend this book for people who are capable of dealing with disgusting facts without throwing up. My mom and dad like this book also."
5,Buy this book!,"I thought the book was really good, it told me all aboutdigestion and what happens to food once it's inside you and what kindof germs can make a hole in your guts, and that your liver makes salt and it just tells you everything about your body and it's really good."
2,This Software Does Save!,This Software Does Save files in the Format you want Them to. but Look very Cheap Quality. so it saves Money.!$
3,Office Suite 2005,"I have downloaded it to my computer, but as yet have not figured out how to use it. I wanted it for a mailing list."
3,The Doctor meets giant arachnids,"An okay story, but it would have fitted better in a four-episode format. Pertwee is as good as ever as the Doctor and there is a memorable climax. But the spiders are what let this down. It's a pity the original, more realistic, models weren't used. This story came under fire for its use of spiders, but I can't quite see the pathetic rubber toys with their silly voices scaring anyone but the most arachnophobic of people, who wouldn't watch a story called 'Planet of the Spiders' in the first place. Once again we have a story let down by feeble execution."
5,Fantastic!,"Planet of the Spiders(POS)Is fantastic. Even though the spiders are laughable the story is brilliant and will have you glued to the screen throughout. People who think this story won't be any good-Think again. This is a jewel of the Pertwee era. There are some brilliant momments which make Pertwee's Regeneration a joy to watch. A lot of people didn't like Jon Pertwee's regneration I disagree. Even though it is a little quick it is a great experience to watch. If you suffer from arachnaphobia don't worry about being scared by the ""spiders"" Which were possibly the only fault this story has(I'm not too keen on the silly voices either!)You won't be as you'll be laughing at them and be enyoying every momment this video is on(Guaranteed!) STRONGLY RECCOMENDED!"
3,Note: these are IMPACT grade sockets...,"These are probably great sockets, but do note they are ""IMPACT"" grade.For most folks this will not matter, but I was going to put these in an on-board motorcycle toolcase so the larger size and higher weight was an issue for me and I ended up returning them."
1,Won't ship you the chrome plate frame!,I received the frame with the gold bow tie instead of what I paid for which is the chrome bow tie. Don't waste your time buying this if you are expecting to get what's advertised!!!
2,They sent Gold Bow Tie instead of the Chrome Bow Tie I ordered.,"First off , I like the Plate Frame and it was an inexpensive price for it . I just would like it better if they sent the Chrome Plate Frame that they advertised and I ordered , rather than what I got , which was the Gold Bow Tie ."
3,Twin Souls-Forever in Love,"The author needs to release the hostility she feels for the people she was betrayed by. Forgiveness can conquer. She needs to go deep into her inner self and help bring about the manifestation of God's true essence for it isn't until she can accomplish that will she be ready to totally connect with her twin soul. Pure love isn't only for the twin-it is for all souls. It's universal.I know the pain all too well that the author has experienced through the meeting of her twin soul. But the ""evolvement"" that takes place from the meeting and the eventual coming together of the twin souls is like no other.Sincerely..."
4,Useful book,"Informative book on the many types of different dough used in making meals from appetizers,meat dishes and even deserts.I was impressed with the various doughs and how they can be used in different ways, from baking, frying, boiling and steaming.There is something for almost every one"
5,The best of pocket pastry!!,"This is the best book I have bought concerning yeast, butter and soda pastry doughs and by far the most informative. The fillings offered are a wonderful selection of the best from around the globe and domestically as well. The author knows her subject well and the recipe instructions and tip notes are invaluable. I highly recommend this book to the beginner looking into pastry pocket endevor and to the seasoned cook who wants to expand into first rate savory pastries. Wonderful use and listing of herbs and other dough seasonings and there is a world of information in this smaller book, as is the case with the rest of the series from the publisher."
2,Not as expected.,"I bought this book as it is so often advertised in conjunction with the Dough makers Pastry presses, but very little inside the book pertains to them. Very disappointed."
5,MEA V2,This is a graduate level book. I am taking graduate level course. I purchased this book at an excellent price. The book arrived timely.
2,"I was sent a proof copy--great book, useless for class","The only hint in the book itself that it's not the right printing is the note on the blank pages 6 and 7 ""[[CP: Other permissions to be listed here, when all in. Allow 2 pages]]"". That and the fact that, two weeks into my class, we figured out that all my page numbers are at least 20 pages off, and I'm missing the timelines, and ALL THE ILLUSTRATIONS.Other than that, it's a nicely put-together text, and my class is really enjoying it. I'm just disappointed that Amazon sent a non-final copy."
5,great resource,am reading this as part of a United Methodist history class. these primary resources are fascinating and also are a great resource for writing research papers.
3,This does NOT interface with the Braun MX2050 Blender,"The Braun MX2050 Blender is a great blender, we have worn out one (daily smoothies from late spring to early fall), and then our recent one just blew a blade, the ""gearing"" teeth at the bottom just completely shredded.I went online to find another blade and ordered this replacement (the K-1000) since Amazon links the two together in the search for accessories. However, this is NOT the right part for the Braun MX2050 Blender. Just want everyone to know."
5,Lavender Air Scense,"I have been using this product for over 10 years and I was impressed with the relaxing results. I have used the lavender to spray the bed pillows at home before retiring for the night as well as in any hotel room traveled. Before the 3oz rule on airlines, I have used my lavender spray in the seating area of the flight to help me relax. Before I get a massage I spray the room and the face pillow to get the best relaxing results. I have been happy from day one that I tried using this product. No complaints other than I have come to this site to make a new purchase because I accidently dropped my existing can and the nozzle broke off and I am needing a replacement asap. I will reccommend this product and every household, or office should have at least one available for use."
4,A Well-Written Compendum Of 50 Years Of EC Research,"The free, available executive summary gives a nice introductory to his books bursting at the seems with research information from the most notable names in early childhood education.It may not apply too much to classroom teachers, but it will greatly help higher education scholars."
5,Powerful,"This self-titled CD has a very powerful traditional celtic sound, The tunes are so well arranged that I couldn't stop my feet from moving, and the harmonies of the brother/sister dou are some of the best I have ever heard. Origionality is definatly the key to this album, it is well worth the money."
5,Your best lens is often your feet,"Kerry Drager covers a range of topics, that include lenses, lighting, Depth of Field, and composition, to name a few.Throughout each topic he dispenses practical advice such as remembering to bring a snack or a plastic tarp and padding to protect your clothing and save your knees.Written in a clear, simple, yet engaging manner, this book covers a broad range of material for scenic photography enthusiasts.Well illustrated, this book provides ample examples to have the reader clamoring to run out with their camera and put some good advice to immediate use."
4,Good inspirational book,"The photos in this book are stunning. For a person who loves to travel and take scening photos -like I do- will find this book inspirational.Text is clear, no small fonts as in many other photo books and photos really stand out, however don't expect full discussions and step by step instructions on how to get the same results as the author."
3,Nothing out of the ordinary,"A pleasant enough book with pleasant enough images, but nothing out of the ordinary. The content of this book is no different than many other general photography books out there. This is certainly not a 5-star book, as the ratings below would suggest."
4,a beautiful guide to the park,"I think this book is very helpful and very complete. It covers every trail in Rocky Mountain Park. It is precise in describing the level of difficulty for every trail, and the photos are helpful and beautiful.I found, however, that it was too big and heavy for me to carry in my backpack on the trail, and I would have liked the author's opinion on the enjoyment rating of the trail, maybe a star system or a few words as to wether this trail would be worth doing.I also missed some info for the neighbouring wilderness areas, such as Indian Peak Wilderness, or Roosevelt National Forest, which were not covered at all.I always go on the trail with my other smaller guide, but I think owning this book is a very good idea, it is a great cross reference book and very worthwile to own. I used it everyday and enjoyed it."
5,Rocky Trails,One of the best if not the best hiking guides to the park. I have led and/or followed hikes to 30 or more locales in the park and find this book to have the most complete and accurate write-ups.............
1,unorganized descriptions,Poor guide to RMNP. First book by the author and it shows. One of the worst guides I've bought in 15 years of hiking and climbing.
4,Authoritative and comprehensive guide to trails in RMNP,The authjor is welll known and experienced. This is a comprehensive and handy go-to book for trail information in RMNP.
5,Loved this.,"This was exactly what I wanted, only a different region! Make sure you read which region you are searching for before making the purchase. It has all the trail heads, mileage, grade of inclines, and more. Unfortunately I bought the one for Southern Colorado, instead of the Denver, Boulder, Western Slope. Awesome information."
2,Great to look at after you have been there,"Absolutely useless. Poorly organized and makes no sense. No, I repeat no, recommendations. I am sorry I purchased. Author seems to be proudest of hiking every trail when she should have been organizing this book."
1,"Quantity, ... not Quality","The author does a good job of listing almost every hike available. I thoroughly enjoyed the story behind the writing of this book, but I found the hike descriptions too brief to be of any use. In the end i relied on a National Geographic/Trails Illustrated topo maps of ""Rocky Mountains"" and ""Indian Peaks"" purchased at a local hiking store, and Jerome Malitz's (Rock Mountain Park Day hikers guide). I ended up using this book as reading material after hiking all day, and as reference material to plan hikes for the upcoming day."
4,It's Got A Use....And I LIKE That Use!,"Lars Eighner's work is really fairly literate for one-handed reading. Some of the material is looking a bit dated in the light of safer sex, the Net and other ""gifts"" of our time, but the overall premise is sound. If hot college boys gettin' it on do the job for you, grab this book in one hand, kick back and relax, and enjoy the diversion. It's the intelligent alternative to most of the stroke fiction out there."
2,Gorgeous but uncomfortable!,"These Circa by Joan and David are gorgeous shoes but cannot be worn for an extended period of time. There is not enough padding in the sole of the shoe. If I wear them even for a few hours, my toes hurt, and actually go numb! This is not my first pair of Joan and David's and it is unfortunate that such a high end shoe is so uncomfortable! I will not ever purchase another pair."
5,Playable even to a Star Trek fan.,"On a list of Doctor Who's most playable shows at a party or with friends who are unfamilar with The Doctor or Sci-fi buddies that have succombed to a Star Trek one sighted vision this is the best. The story is has elements to carry seamlessly into this decade. The story is fun, has excellent thought stimuli in the plot and is as good as any modern sci-movie that comes out today. (forgiving a little old computer graphics in dream sequences and some cheesy music in the begining)"
3,"""Bless my soul, so you've done it again, Doctor...""","Trapped on a spaceship in a warp-elipse, the crew of the TARDIS are somehow trapped between 1977 and 1983. How is the Black Guardian involved? Who and what exactly is Turlough? And will two aspects of the Brigadier converge? A great reunion of the Doctor and the Brig, a return of the Black Guardian, and a new companion for the Doctor might be deadly. There are some big ideas in this story. And the fact that the story takes place in two time zones is wonderful. Turlough comes off pretty good in this story. David Collins gives a great performance as Mawdryn. The whole thing is very inconsequential, but everyone really looks like they're having a good time playing their parts. A breath of fresh air, really."
4,Pricey Paperbacks,"Me, too. I am reading the Petit Nicholas series to help my French, that is. They are wonderful stories; I read one out loud every night to my wife and we fall asleep chuckling. I give it only four stars, however, because of Amazon's prices. I just returned to the U.S. from France where I bought several books in the series in shops at a high-profile ski resort where everything is expensive. I paid between 6.30 and 7.90 euros for these books in France (January 2013), which is around 8-10 dollars. The books contain pages of Monsieur Semp√©'s sketches interspersed amongst the stories. They are delightful too, but there aren't really so many pages to read. What I am saying is that $15-24 is a lot to pay for a paperback with about 75 pages of printing to read."
1,100 pages less than announced!,"I picked this book in spite of the fact that it was more expensive than other books with the same name, because I thought it was bigger. The details on amazon say ""250 pages"". That is not true. There are only 156 pages. I paid double for what I could have gotten for half price."
4,very pleased,book arrived 5 days earlier than expected. book is very cute and simple. good for children who speak french or french students.
5,"sweet, warm humor that transcends culture","The author who cowrote the Asterix series once again transcends cultural barriers with his innocent, warm, boyish humor.This book is an absolute delight. While it seems to be marketed to mature kids, I think that the older the reader, the more it will be liked, particlarly for those nostalgic for a bygone era. Anyone who speaks French at an intermediate level can get through it. However, you'll appreciate it more if you've achieved some fluency and if you've spent some time in France.I challenge anyone reading it to refrain from smiling, or even laughing out loud. I can't wait to read the other books in the series."
1,One of the final nails in Doctor Who's coffin ...,"This episode defines all the abominable horrors in Doctor Who's final years which sealed its fate and got it cancelled. Silly premises, camp execution, inability to suspend disbelief, bland dialogue and virtually lucidiously homosexual secondary characters with child molesting undertones makes this story (and most all late 80s Doctor Who episodes) unwatchable for the over 10 year old crowd. I was still trying to watch the series at this point, but even I couldn't take the schlock in THIS demented episode. Obviously I am not alone in feeling put out since all of Britain quit watching by this time in the series enormous history."
3,see the TARDIS painted pink!,Average episode. Not exceptionally good or bad. However seeing the TARDIS painted pink assures it a place in any serious collecters collection. END
4,What a sweet planet,"The Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and companion arrive in a colony where the authorities want everybody to be happy - on pain of death. A clever parody of Britain under Thatcher's rule as well as being great sci-fi. It's just a pity that the original, more sinister, design for the Kandyman wasn't used rather than that silly Bertie Bassett lookalike who seems to form a comedy double-act with Gilbert M."
2,Stupid episode ! One of the series worst!,This the dumbest episode of the series! The plot is hardly there and the acting wooden! Only watch this episode if you are a fan of the series or of Mccoy!
1,The Crappiness Patrol,"I can't believe all the drug-induced positive reviews this story received. Sylvester McCoy's stories are inferior to the rest of the series, hinting that the doctor is something more than a time lord from Gallifrey. But this is the worst of the worst, the crap dela crap! While watching, I couldn't prevent that awful song ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"", from intruding my brain. I love you, you love me, we are a happy family... I'm expecting Barney to show up any second. Helen A? Suzy Q? Earl S? Daisy K? Silas P? Is this Doctor Who or Romper Room?I have read all the apologists for this story claim that it parallels Thatcher's reign in the UK. However, that is pure left-wing idiocy. Unfortunately, like that horrible aforementioned song, this story sticks in your mind and won't go away."
1,There's Nowhere To Go From Here But Up...,"Truly, I cannot think of a Doctor Who story I've seen that was as bad as this. It features a whole cast of boring characters, a thoroughly ridiculous idea of a plot, the worst villain in the show ever (the KandyMan. Spelled with a 'K', my god is there no end to the stupidity), and some strange little sewer people put there for absolutely no reason that I can see. In short, I agree with 'Cincinatti' and ask the question: Why was this made?"
4,Campy and quirky,"I am surprised to see the ambivalent reviews below, since I found this to be an entertaining episode, capturing the flavor of the show. The outlaw blues musician, a killer candyman, and women with rainbow-colored mohawks murderously enforcing the law of the land: perfect, over-the-top Doctor Who. Even near the end of the series' run, it still found new directions to grow."
1,"Kandy Man, Give Me A Break!","Kandy Man in a kitchen of death, people getting killed by colorful ray guns, and executions of kiljoys by strawberry ooze. Give me a break. This story is by far the worst story ever. It failed miserably in an attempt to discuss how we can't avoid ""negative"" emotions--anger, depression, grief. If you want to see some better McCoy stories, I would suggest Battlefield or Silver Nemesis."
4,One of the best Mccoy episodes,Ok it might not be one of the greateast episodes of Doctor Who ( but one of the best Mccoy's). But it does make a profound stament about Regan/Thatcher economic policys. With its dark interptaion of inner citys with punk rocker gangs it shows the desctruction of social idealism and the decline of the modern city. it has some of the same context as Blade Runner but not as profound as the movie. Still you should see it
4,Not all Geishas are nice and friendly!,"Today on Doctor Who: The McCoy Generation of ""Putting A Ferret Down Your Pants, Becoming a Kang, Fighting Arthurian Evil In The Present Day and Delta and The (Evil) Bannermen, Etc."", we learned several things about the ""Happiness Patrol"" episode.1. The HP are Geishas With Guns!2. The Kandyman is like Willy Wonka,only evil.3. To maintain balance, happiness mustexist side by side with sadness. Two sides,one coin!4. They had to do a story like this. DoctorWho was danger of retiring.5. Watch this story. You might like us better, too.I would have given this five stars, if not for the following...1. The Red Kangs, Bin Liner and Fire Escape (Paradise Towers) weren't in it. BTW, are they there real names?2. The Daleks weren't there to take over Terra Alpha. Imagine...a PINK DALEK?!Still, good funny McCoy era Doctor Who mayhem and humour. Watch it, and remember...'happiness (and love of Doctor Who) will prevail!'."
5,It's the Doctor and Ace on the loose again.,"The Happiness PatrolBehind a forced exterior of happiness, a planet is ruled by a ruthless leader and an evil entity known only as the Kandy Man who carries out bizzar and lethal experiments on the citizens. Can the Doctor and Ace uncover what is going on and put a stop to it before they too are captured? END"
5,Give this one a chance...,"...and if you don't like it, give it another chance. And if you still don't like it, I'm not sure what the problem is. This story is magic and works on many levels. It's great for kids or adults. It's adventure and it's political allegory. It's gray and it's pink. It's funny and it's deathly serious. Okay, enough...But seriously, it's classic Who. And like many of the seventh Doctor adventures (Paradise Towers, Delta and the Bannermen), it's about saving one small colony with a set group of people, not about saving the whole galaxy or universe. It's the Doctor interfering the best he can."
1,Several facts are not accurate.,Check the facts from examples discussed in this books. Many are fabricated to support the authors' points of view.
4,This thing is great!,I bought this for my two year old because she saw it in her doctor's office and she loved it. It is one of the most consistently played with toys in the house.
1,Safety Concern,"My son loved this toy. Unfortunately, my son somehow managed to get one of the little blue round parts to the hammer off. Of course, he put it in his mouth. It was a VERY scary sight. He is fine and continues to enjoy the toy with a hammer from another brand. But, I want to alert anyone that purchases this product."
3,Love and adventures in the second century.,"This novel is still a worth-while read, but some 'escapes' of the main characters are, although sometimes very original (still now), highly unlikely.This work has the same theme as 'Callirhoe' by Chariton written in the same century : monogamous love. The two lovers overcome the most incredible difficulties, but will find each other at the end of the story to live happily together.The style is baroque, with long digressions and brutal scenes, like sacrificial death. The main aim is : sensationalism.It has not the psychological richness of 'Callirhoe'. The author uses well known types: the not so innocent lovers, the good and the bad, the rich and the poor, the slaves and the powerful.Good picture of the living conditions in the 2nd century.Interesting work, not only for historians."
5,beautifully written memior,"A must-read for all missionary biography lovers. Spiritually insightful, beautiful writing, enjoyable read. So glad to see it back in print."
3,I dunno,"I probably wouldn't have got it if it wasn't for having a gift certificate burning a hole in my pocket and since I plowed all the way through Underworld, which, having done so I regard as one of the greatest books of my life. The fella upstairs there, oddly, I spent several years with a man, autistic, who parroted his father yelling at him on the other side of the door where he was locked for 30 years. He did this for a few weeks when he was taken off his meds, otherwise the man spoke hardly at all. The voice and inflection was perfect for his dead father, a wicked old cuss. But anyways that rang true to me, and I guess the book began to mean something to me after that, something about words just really hanging out there in the air."
3,A brief diversion,"This is the second book I've read by DeLillo. The first, Underworld, is a hefty tome; this one is so brief it is actually questionable that it can be called a novel. Certainly, the idea of paying a hardcover price for this book is ludicrous unless you're a diehard DeLillo fan.This is kind of a ghost story, but there is more of a psychological than supernatural element to this ghost. As with Underworld, I found this book to be fascinating without really being very clear. DeLillo is brilliant at focusing on the minor details of life, but he makes it hard to see the bigger picture.It is also hard to get very interested in the main character in this story who is so self-absorbed that she has practically shut out the outside world. A protagonist does not necessarily have to be sympathetic, but she should at least be interesting, and this one is not.If you like descriptive language and are not too big on story or character, you might enjoy this book."
1,A Poltergeist in Tight Whites,"DeLillo should be ashamed of himself. One gets the feeling, reading this book, that DeLillo halfheartedly penned this story in response to a writing assignment from a college professor - double spacing the lines and using an extra large font and widened margins in order to meet the 100 page minimum. The dialogue between the protagonist, Lauren Hartke, and the ""mysterious"" man who suddenly appears in her bedroom one day wearing nothing but his Fruit-of-the-Looms, is not in the least bit insightful or thought provoking...it's just plain stupid. Don't be deceived by the literary pundits who extrapolate great meaning and depth to this book: The emperor has no clothes (just some soiled undergarments)."
1,Tedious,"Sometimes I thnk the more determinedly tedious and ambiguous an author, the more some fools rush to proclaim what lovely raiments the emporer sports.Dental work, a bad sitcom, even wrestling would have been more interesting that the short time it took to read this bit of trash. Nothing is delivered. Nothing."
1,god awfull,"This book was by far DeLillo's worst. The book was rather short, yet I had to fight the urge to put it down after every page. I gave DeLillo the benifit of the doubt, and I wish I hadn't. I was confused throughout about what was going on but more about why I should care. I feel sorry for anyone who is introduced to this giant of American Literature through this book. BEWARE DELILLO FANS THIS ONE WILL DISSAPOINT!"
2,Um....what?,"Did I miss something?? This book is beautifully written but completely without point or plot. I kept reading it only based on the fact that I thought there would be some revelation at the end explaining what the rest of the book was supposed to mean, but there never is. I finished this book feeling unsatisfied. If you don't like stream of consciousness writing, this probably isn't for you either."
1,Hated it.,"Hey, I liked ""White Noise"" too. But give me a break. Completely implausible with precious little insight to Delillo's masterful skill with dialogue and his uncanny ability to sculpt a feeling of despair and dread.Simply: what this book whiffs on altogether is a strain of narration into which a reader may engage. That's important.Over time, reviews of this book are more well-received. I think it's because Amazon.com readers are looking for an excuse to say ""novella."" That's what I think. This book was appropriately panned when it first arrived and will not endure."
2,Short and tedious,"This book is over my head. ""White Noise"" is one of the greatest books I've read. This novella is no ""White Noise."" It has a tedious stream-of-conciousness vibe to it. After it was done, I forget about it. You will too. Buy ""White Noise."""
4,A Single-Sitting Masterpiece,"You just gotta love the way DeLillo returned to the world of fiction after the gargantuan epic ""Underworld"" with this sparse, minimalistic novella. Gotta love it! Aside from the boldness of this move, I found ""The Body Artist"" to be very interesting and well worth the two or three hours it took to read it. I think it is a bold step forward (or backwards?) for DeLillo and would like to see more contemporary authors give up their ""Ulysses"" aspirations for a book or two and tackle a novella. At this point, it seems to me that DeLillo can do no wrong."
1,Gut-wrenching...In A Bad Way,"I love finding good, short novels - novels I can get engrossed in and conquer in one sitting, written so well they leave you wanting more. So when I'm in the mood for a short novel, I'll walk the aisles of the local bookstore and pluck a few thin volumes from the shelves. I had long been interested in The Body Artist but was unwilling to pay... for the hardcover. But when the paperback appeared, it was one of those titles I picked up.Unfortunately, The Body Artist is not a good short novel. It is not engrossing, rather it is slow moving with poorly developed characters and absolutely no action to drive what little plot there is. The only shred of hope for this little novel is the language with which it is written. DeLillo is clearly a fine author. But there's not a great deal of proof to back it up here."
2,Don't start here with DeLillo,"Short and slight. Read ""End Zone"", ""White Noise"" or ""Libra"" and you'll understand why DeLillo is highly rated. Read this and you'll wonder what the fuss was about."
3,Read it in the bookstore.,"Imagine this: you buy a ticket to a movie made by one of your favorite directors, costs you 22 bucks, you fork out money for popcorn, a coke, some granola bars - or whatever - and you came super early to get the best seat in the theater. Very quickly the place fills up, the lights go down and the movie begins. A plot starts to unfold. It's looking like a really great piece of work. Maybe one of his best. But the movie ends. The lights go up and everyone leaves. And you're still sitting there chewing on that first handful of popcorn. Haven't even touched your coke. Your seat hasn't even warmed up yet. What flashed before your eyes was maybe some the greatest 16 seconds of film you've ever seen in your life. Maybe not. It all happened so fast, it was hard to tell. But one thing's for sure: you're out of money. You're out of money and here they come already, Hoovering up the aisle..."
2,Body Artist is the Emperor with No Clothes,"The Body Artist by Don DeLillo is a good example of ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" syndrome in a book. It is creatively experimental, parts are breathtaking in its poetic observation, it is fascinating at times, but ultimately, the story is confusing and not especially interesting - although at a little more than 100 pages you don't have time to become completely bored. It is possible that in Mr. DeLillo's quest to write something out of the ordinary, he has left most readers behind. I strongly recommend his brilliant novel ""White Noise"" (5 of 5 stars for me), and his equally brilliant ""Libra"" over this highly creative but confusing experiment that didn't always work."
3,"Frustrating, but often stunning","The Body Artist is unfulfilling and frustrating. It is basically a plotless meditaion on love, loss, and the confusion death brings. The appearence of Mr. Tuttle into the life and house of Lauren after the suicide of her husband, is unexplained. Is he an escaped mental patient, a ghost, a delusion of Lauren's grief? Don't expect an answer here because Delillo's not telling.If it's so aggravating, why three stars? The beauty of the opening scene, a simple breakfast between Lauren and her husband, the description of Lauren's performance (She is the title character, an artist who creates with her body as the vehicle for her art) and many other scenes in this book are just sheer brilliance. Delillo's reasons for creating this book puzzles me, but some of the scenes within I will remember for a long time."
2,Difficult to like,"The Body Artist is a very thin story written in dense, wandering thoughts. DeLillo's craftsmanship with prose is a redeemable quality, but due to my lack of interest in the characters or plot, it won't linger."
4,Definately intriguing...,"This is definately an interesting book! Despite appearing to be a rather brief read it is incredibly intricate in both its context and DeLillo's writing style. The rhetoric gets a bit complex at points and can be rather odd, yet it seems to add to his respective themes relating to human perception of time, death, life, and oneself. I certianly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys analyzing literature or deliberating upon it. If you don't want to think at a relatively 'deep/reflective' level then I wouldn't recommend this book as it would basically be just odd."
4,Interestingly Bizarre,"This book is slow, dreamy, surreal, and very strange. None of the characters seem normal, and this is evident from the very first page or two. The body artist character isn't a tattoo artist like I had assumed, but a performance artist and contortionist. The theme is mainly about dealing with grief, although the way the character does this isn't something that would be possible in real life, so you can't say it is a life lesson.It's definitely not an exciting book, either - not much happens once you get past the second chapter.But it's worth reading for a couple of reasons - especially for its sheer creativity: like nothing else you've ever read before, this definitely makes for an interesting change. And also because it's very short, a novella really. The slowness that would be a major drag in a longer book is not a problem in this one.(124 pages)"
1,Delillo double-bogey,"I have come to expect more from DeLillo than this effort. The Body Artist is one of the most artsy, pretentious novels I've ever read."
1,A deception,"This book has been debated ad nauseam--is it brilliant, or is it thin? Despite all the hype, the postmodern techniques Dellilo employs have been used before by better writers for better purposes. This book is a slight achievement in both size as well as substance. But Delillo has reached that level of fame where each book becomes a juggernaut, so backed by money, advertising, and blurbs by other writers that it is guaranteed to succeed commercially. If this book had been published under a pseudonym or annonymously, it would have instantly disappeared from view. The writing is so labored, so agonizingly bent on appearing profound, that there is no spontaneity. Self-consciousness and self-reflexiveness are not necessarily proofs of depth. Delillo begins to sound like a parody of himself."
3,Ma and Pa become grandparents...and move back to the farm,"In this installment of the Kettle series, Ma and Pa become grandparents when their son, Tom, and his wife, Kim, become parents themselves. Kim's parents arrive from Boston to help out with the baby, and tensions rise between the grandmothers. The end result--Ma and Pa leave the start of art modern home to return to the squalor of the squattors flat. Included is the standard screwball humor, and the introduction of Kim's parents is important as background for Ma and Pa Kettle On Vacation (an essential film). However, for Kettle films, this one falls squarely in the middle. It is a good film, not quite as good as the first 3 (including The Egg and I), better than At the Fair, In the Ozarks, or Old McDonalds Farm."
5,HP Deskjet 6980 Color Printer,"Delivery was quick. Installing was fast. Got it to sink up the first time connecting to LAN and printer sharing. Quality is great, picture is great. Easy to install. Great Product. Not having all the other problems like some of the other owners."
3,Good printer for the price,"The ink is lasting, the printer is quiet, and it prints decent pictures as well. My only complaint is that it was a pain in the butt to install through the wireless network. None of our three computers wanted to recognize it till we pinged the computer's IP address.... other than that, it is wonderful!"
4,Quality Color Printer at a Reasonable Price,"Sturdy and easy to setup. Connected directly to PC via USB. I'm just using this for text and the prints look good.I bought this for $129, now it's $299. Go figure."
5,Fine product,"It was with great hesitation that I bought this product, and I have no regrets. It works fine with my MAC and I love the convenience of having it in another room, away in my working space. Setting up the printer proved to be a bit of a challenge. I found the directions quite confusing, although I'm generally good at this kind of task. The manual did not make it clear that I needed to go to a specific page on the web to complete the process. Without technical support's help I'd still be trying to figure it out! Maybe they have updated the manual and there will be no problem for new buyers. Probably unlikely. Definitely call them for help with the setup if you can't get the printer working immediately. Once I phoned them, the tech had me up and running quite quickly."
2,Years of problems,"Years of issues with reinstalling the printer cartridge...there is a spring along the side of the cartridge that does not stay in place and it can and will rip a hole in the flex circuit on the print head of the printer itself, scrapping the entire printer. Do not buy this unit! I have spent literally hours each and every time I had to change the print cartridge. Not worth the effort."
3,Decent wireless printer - Great for the price,"Like the title says, this is a decent wireless printer. No bells and whistles, no scanner, no copier, no fax - Just what I wanted. The only problem I have is a modest one; I have to 'reset' the printer often by turning it off and back on after 10 seconds. Sometimes it goes a couple of days before I have to reset it and some days I have to reset it every time I print.However, I would recommend this printer for anyone who would prefer resetting their printer every so often compared to running printer cords to and from inconvenient spots.Given the choice (and the price) I would purchase this product again."
4,"Small cartridges; prints well, but in an odd ""back-order""","I'll give 4 stars for great prints, but having it less than 2 weeks isn't yet enough time to give more.Like many who've had older printers, I too miss larger ink cartridges, but this machine DOES take larger ones than most other HP's now.Yesterday it started printing documents beginning at BACK page & ended at the FRONT, no matter how I tried to adjust otherwise. Spent 2 hours ea. with HP techs last night & today; they had me uninstall, then reinstall each time to try figuring it out (at least installing with them went faster than by myself!) They're equally baffled, but will get back to me to help solve it -- or exchange it for another if they can't fix it :)Overall, though, this machine seems like a good investment. Sure glad I first looked at these Amazon reviews before buying!(Oh, to someone who said exiting paper just flops on desk, there IS a small pull-out tab on the end of the out-tray; just hard to see & tough to grab & adjust)"
4,"Great Printer, but you'd better have a new Linksys router!","I was able to get this printer at a good price & liked the wireless idea. But when I opened the box and read the instructions I learned I had to use a router with a ""Easy setup"" button - i.e. a recent Linksys router. My router is a Netgear and functions very well, thank you.There were alternate network options to set up the wireless access manually, but the instructions were for Windows XP, not Vista. (This a year after Vista was introduced.) Other workarounds weren't particularly workable either.After futzing around with it, I ended up buying a USB connection for $36 and used it that way. I grimaced at the price, but 4 months later, I'm glad to using the printer without having to entirely re-do my wireless network."
5,Excellent,"I had this Deskjet 6980 wireless printer up and runningwireless in short order. Works great with both my Toshibalaptops with Windows Vista with sp1 installed.I did use the installation disk.I did have a problem on only one laptop with the installdisk, for some reason the laptop would not read the CD?I transferred the CD to a usb flash drive and run the installfrom it."
2,Not for the long haul,"I loved this printer. It worked well with our wireless and made clear photos. When I tried to change the cartridge for the first time, a spring broke that is supposed to hold the cartridge in place. Now it no longer works. I would expect a cheap printer to last me around a year, but this was not cheap, nor were the cartridges. After a week in customer service heck, I'm getting it replaced by HP, but since it is two months over warranty, I needed to pay for that replacement. How convenient for them, eh? If you buy this printer, get the extended warranty. The people who work for customer service were all very nice, but the way it is set up is infuriating... each call requires several phone transfers and repetition of numbers and personal information."
4,Great printer...installation not for the faint-of-heart...,"In the end, this printer works fine. I bought it because most reviews rated it as good - even better than the 6988 that replaces it. I didn't want anything fancy, just a reliable printer that would communicate with my wireless router connected to Windows XP (wired and wireless) and Mac OS computers (wired). It does all that fine. The only real problem, as others have said, is that the documentation, instructions, screen shots, etc. - especially for the Mac - don't look anything like what you will experience setting this printer up. If you're comfortable winging it a little, you can probably get it up and running pretty easily. If you're one who stumbles at the first sign of an installation not mimicking the printed material it may become frustrating. Online help may be better, I never checked. It seems like another example of people writing the documentation who never actually performed a setup."
3,Great printer except for the wireless connection.,"I have two 6900 series printers. I love the print quality, ink longevity, no cleaning the print heads constantly (like some other brands I won't mention), easy photos and envelopes. all around great product. However if you plan to interface this printer with several computers via wireless connection(802.11x) they are a nightmare (with Macs at least). lousy software, lousy documentation. Stick to USB or Ethernet connections to stay happy."
4,Happy customer except.........,"I am very pleased with the HP DeskJet 6980 Color Printer. The only thing that I was not pleased with was the printer setup. The instructions are not very clear as to what step is needed for installation, you are basically guessing your way through."
4,Prints well but full of bloatware.,"Installation was a pain (XP popped up fifteen billion ""installing device"" screens during the installation) and the printer is full of the typical HP bloatware with no option to avoid installation of the extra junk. A printer should have a printer driver and that's it, we don't need another image viewer/editor, ink monitor, HP customer service center, etc. There's no reason that a printer's installation should require 200 megs of hard drive space.Somebody else mentioned that there is no paper tray. There is one, but it is too small to function and your pages do fall all over the place. The bright side though is that the printer does print well. Pages look great and come out fairly quick.Be forewarned, the power cord is one of those two-cord power block things and the part that goes into the outlet is VERY short, so plan on keeping the power block on the floor near the outlet (I like to keep mine on the credenza behind the printer but couldn't do it with this one)."
1,Do NOT buy this printer.,"This is absolutely the worst printer you could buy. It comes off-line every time you fill the paper or change the ink cartridge (which, by the way, is insanely difficult to do) and then, just to rub salt in your wounds, the HP company CHARGES you to help you at their 1-800 number, I am not kidding. $34 bucks a pop. If you have problems with this defective product, you can pay them to try to get the thing working again.I'm only one year into owning it, and now, on top of all the other grief it has given me, the printing is unstable, prints fuzzily and double-lines. It's un-usable now.I will NEVER buy another HP product."
3,Printed great photos until / And ... wow ... great HP service!,"Owned for over 2 years. I had no problems connecting wirelessly or via network. I was very pleased with the photo prints. However, my printer is a large paperweight. The ink cartridge retaining spring and the plastic mount that holds the spring in place have broken off rendering the device useless. I was always careful when replacing ink cartridges. Recommend Extreme caution when replacing yours.~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update: I contacted HP. No, I didn't call them. Rather, I used the instant chat from their web site. I explained my situation and they offered to send me a replacement printer at no charge to me DESPITE the printer warranty having expired. The replacement printer arrived at my house 2 days later. Good Job HP"
5,Printer,"I bought this printer for my son-in-law. He wanted a wireless printer, and pleased with the product."
4,Easy to set up for both PC and Mac,"We needed a new printer to replace two Epson inkjet printers that had stopped working. After doing some research and on the advice of a relative we chose the 6980 due to the Mac/PC compatibility and the fact that we could hook it up to our network (an ethernet cable even comes with the printer).I found the installation instructions easy, and had it hooked up to the PC in no time. We then installed the software on the Mac laptop and followed the instructions, and everything worked fine - we can now print from the laptop, no cables required! We haven't done any extensive printing, but so far, we're very happy with the Deskjet 6980."
4,Good deal on a wireless printer,"I recently purchased this for a friend and helped them install it. It was very easy, the instructions seem to be great for even the ""technologically challenged"". You do have to find the correct set of instructions for you set up, the manual seems to think most people have a Linksys router with the ""SecureEasySetup"" option. The print quality is very good, we tested multiple papers and a photo. Everything was set up and ready to go within 45 mins. Personally, I'd go with a laser printer because of the low yield of an inkjet cartridge compared to its price. But if you're looking for an inkjet, $149 is a great price considering there is wireless built in. I'd highly recommend this printer."
4,Easy set-up on a Mac,"It seems most people having problems setting this up are on Windows machines or Windows/Mac or Windows/Linux networks. I just now set it up for my home Mac network, and it was pretty much a snap. I used the ethernet cable to connect it to my Netgear wifi router, and now all the Macs in the house can talk to it. The most time-consuming part was loading the software/drivers on the machines."
5,Very underated Peter Davison story,"Why Planet of Fire is so criticized is a mystery to me. This episode has one of the most thorough plots and some of the best production values of any Peter Davison story. And as any true Doctor Who fan will know, production values were a trouble spot in this era of the show. Fortunately, this story feels a lot better than some ""certain"" stories from previous seasons. And fitting in betwenn Ressurection of the Daleks and Caves of Androzani, forms the center piece in a trilogy that sees Doctor Davison out in fine fashion.Planet of Fire really benefits from some excellent location filming and thorough workings of a not-so-foreign society. Peter Davison and Mark Strickson really shine, and even though I think Nicola Bryant is one of the worst companions in Doctor Who, she doesn't detract too much. We finally see what Turlough was doing on Earth and he gets a nice departure, leaving our favorite time traveler heading off minus his last male traveling companion."
2,Dissapointing dvd release,"After years of waiting we finaly get one of my fav stories. But instead of an added bonus of new cgi effects with a complete story, (like they did with ""invisible enemy) we get a butchered ""fake"" wide screen version. Top and bottom with black bars, and 25 minutes cut out on a 2nd disk. On the first disk we get the full vhs length, but with original effects. They did show some of the ""original broadcast"" that has more footage previousy cut from the vhs, but only as a special feature and with printing over the top so I can't just add it in myself with the computer. Also, I was hoping that the photo gallery would have some production stills of peri in her bikini. No such luck since it is erroneously thought of as a kiddie show in england. I wish they would have plain jpegs of nice quality and size accessed by computer on one of the disks, but no one seems to do that. Over all, Long awaited for and dissapointed. Wish they would do it right and on blue ray."
3,The Doctor and Turlough go to answer a destress call.,Pretty good. I actually recorded this episode and I reckon it will be good. Kamelion (The King's Demons) is back. Good effects with the shrunk Master. Poor Kamelion was destroyed also. Awwww!
2,I'm sure it's a great book...,"Just don't buy it as the very first Christmas gift for your new girlfriend, after dating 9 months. Especially when she tells you she's not into Jazz. Guess what, buying her this book...WILL NOT MAKE HER APPRECIATE IT ANY MORE."
1,Ho Hum,"The main strength of this book is that is historical fiction and provides some interesting facts about this time period in the New York area. However, I found it did not engage my interest, is an extremely easy read and predictable. The book has 2-3 subplots, depending on how you count (who got the girl pregnant, what's odd about the minister and who murdered Sarah's husband). The last of these, remained a mystery and the other two I really didn't care about. The author never really peaked my interest IN them. There are much better reads out there to spend your time on!"
3,Just okay,"Actually thought it was just okay. This may be a result of not reading them in order, but I thought the character development was lacking.The Lintons' mentally disabled daughter Grace is pregnant, and she swears no one hurt her. So who's the father? Sarah Brandt is on the case with the help of Frank Malloy. Things only get more complicated when they find out that the minister at the Lintons' church may be abusing young boys. Then the minister drops dead in the middle of communion, apparently poisoned. Everyone is a suspect. Who killed Reverend Upchurch? And who got Grace Linton pregnant?My big problem with the book is that the murder happened in the last 90 pages of the book. There wasn't really a lot of time to flush out suspects and follow the clues. Overall, enjoyable, but for me, not ultimately suspenseful."
4,Great Atmosphere,"Victoria Thompson's Gaslight series is a lot of fun, and this latest entry is no exception. Although there is no murder in the book, she still manages to write an interesting story that kept my interest throughout. We also see Sarah's and Malloy's relationship taken to another level. In this book Sarah and Frank are dealing with the seemier side of life in turn-of-the-century New York City. The events that occurred on Lenox Hill that caused such a shock to the residents could have happened in the present day. It's interesting to see that things have not changed all that much. These are enjoyable characters that I care about. These books are entertaining and quite well-written. I recommend this series to lovers of historical mysteries."
5,Great For History Buffs,"My brother teaches American history in high school, so I bought him this package for his birthday and he said it was a great teaching aid. What you get is a bunch of different film clips over the years of the first three presidents ever to be caught on film. He said t hat the movies really helped ""bring history alive"" in his classroom and he's now reccomending them to other teachers."
4,Mine goes up to 11,"I use these all the time. The outer nylon woven jacket makes them a bit more resistant to abrasion when pulling through little spaces in a stereo cabinet. The connector shells are metal, with well-shaped grips. The fit is tight, without the ""grip of death"" that some cables have. Eight feet is a nice length, long enough for most applications without stretching it, while not so long that you'll have coils of unused cable.The only way they could be better, really, is if they had locking connectors, but these are probably best for general use."
3,"Good for lightweight, not so great for durability","Alloy nipples are fine if you primarily concerned with weight. When you build a new wheel you grease all the sockets so minimum force is required. Once the nipples and wheels have been used for a few years, the nipples are much harder to turn. I find aluminum and some alloy nipples loose their edges and become impossible to turn. For a very small penalty in weight < 1gm, I will now go with brass nipples, 16mm. There is longer square edge for the spoke wrench to grab onto and the brass is stronger and less likely to strip. These comments are about the part in general and not a criticism of Wheelsmith, in fact I use Wheelsmith's silver colored 16mm brass nipples."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"I bought this collection as I really enjoy South Park, however my enjoyment soon turned to extreme disappointment, as it was obvious that the DVDs in the box where not factory originals and the quality of packing and presentation was very poor to say the least. All DVDs come in loose plastic sleeves, most of the writing on the box and DVDs is in Chinese, and nothing really fits as it should inside the box. Then when you watch the DVDs you soon realise that most if not all of the DVDs are copies. Some DVDs are from region 1, region 2, and region 4, some episodes are repeated on different discs and the quality goes form acceptable to very pixilated. NOT FACTORY ORIGINAL. Comedy Central should stop the sale of this very poor quality and misleading product! If I could I would have given this item no stars!"
1,Unofficial,This is an unofficial product. DVDs are neither Warner's or Comedy Central's. These are piracy products. They are handmade
1,????? Why is it still on sale through Amazon ??,"Sorry for stating the obvious, but WHY are Amazon still advertising this for sale when it is blatantly obvious a cheap pirate copy?Until those that advertise, sell, or distribute these kind of fakes are stopped, then what recompense has the buyer got? Especially when Amazon say 'Tough luck, you opened it!!'Amazon should be fined for advertising for sale pirate disks."
1,Not an objective book,"This book is not objective in any sense of the word. Its obvious intent is to encourage people to sign up for the online version of amway, known as quixtar. Coy gives no serious analysis of the downsides of this business, including the fact that the vast majority of people who sign up lose money, and the fact that most of the highest income earners actually make the bulk of their income selling motivational tapes and rally tickets to their ""downlines"". In short, this book, like the business it is pushing, should not be taken seriously."
3,Sounds like some common sense is called for.,"Enthusiastic & pretty exhaustive coverage of Quixtar. Tells you just about all you'd want to know. Curious about the agenda of the critics above & why they bought a book on a topic where they seemed to have a pre-determined outlook? (For that matter, did they buy it before ""reviewing"" it?) The book can't be faulted on factual accuracy, whereas speculative, unsubstantiated opinions in newsgroups would teach you as much about Quixtar as reading pro- & anti-McDonalds discussions would teach you about the experience of eating in a McDonalds. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some FACTS about this new venture. Use some common sense & think for yourself before deciding if the business itself is for you; don't get ""persuaded"" by other people's agendas."
1,"Oouch! Quixcam, just another way to spell scamway","A friend bought the book for me. Unbelievable! Just a nother way to pass off the evil of Amway! The book gives some good info about the internet, but tries (& fails) to explain why quixcam is the method to be a part of it. It is a great resource to see just how far people will go to mask the facts of the business."
1,Looking to join the cult of Amway?,"This book, while by description seems a promising introduction to the E-commerce opportunity, turns out in the end to be just another peice of puffed-up marketing material. The goal here is to get one to fork over the money for an Amway (Amway/Quixtar = same thing, new name in an attempt to re-invent themselves after decades of bad publicity) distributorship, and then keep forking it over to stay ""in the game/build your own business/etc., etc.""."
1,"Another piece of ""literature"" for Ambots and Quixnafuers","Yet another tract for Amway/Quixtar IBOs, written by a paid hack, and designed to further vacuum the wallets of unsuspecting (or brain-dead) victims of this ""cult of free enterprise."""
1,Reminds me of an infomercial,"Don't waste your money or your time. I wasted mine reading the entire book, so I won't waste yours writing a long review."
5,A great guide to why Quixtar is beaking so many records!,"I very much enjoyed The Quixtar Revolution. The book contains many excellent examples of why Quixtar will power into the next several decades. I really enjoyed how the book is devided into two parts. High-Tech and High-Touch. It is easy to read and very well written. Many people review this book as a way to 'dupe' people to look at Amway. This is not about Amway, it's about Quixtar. They are seperate companies. My philosophy, If you seriously look at Quixtar and your not interested. Great. Never settle for less in whatever you do, because now you know, there is a way! :-)"
3,Cardio yoga,"This is set indoors on a small stage/room w/2 backup women, one serving as a modifier. The production value is professional, the music is very low & hardly helps. PJ has a great demeanor, is calming & relaxing. She has a great mind/body workout.That said, this workout has a lot of repetition of going in/out of a single pose so that there is very little time for a variety of moves seeming to teach the absolute beginner. She also gives a lot of instruction & very little calming time. She cues YOUR left/right & reminds you of proper posture/breathing which is great.That said, you will bend in/out of warrior 1, 2 & chair separately many times. There is a lot of holding the arms up to work the arms/shoulders. There is a nice amount of single leg balancing w/a walk in the beginning. There wasn't much time for much else but this alone is a great workout.This is great for those new to yoga or those who don't want a spiritual workout."
1,Not so good,I was expecting the DVD to be more challenging. I found it as a walk in the park. I would not recommend the DVD.
3,No fue lo que esperaba,"Debo comenzar diciendo que esta edici√≥n en DVD no fue del todo positiva, les comento porque: no se si sea error de fabricaci√≥n pero en mi aparato reproductor no codifica el canal central lo que hace que el sonido tenga una tendencia hacia la izquierda, la edici√≥n del video viene cortada entre algunas canciones, es decir, no viene cont√≠nuo lo que hace que se pierda la secuencia de palabras que el cantante emite, sin embargo las canciones agregadas hacen olvidar todo este error, en Paseando por Roma, Zeta demuestra lo virtuoso que es al tocar el bajo, el sonido de la bater√≠a de Alberti se escucha magn√≠fico y de Cerati pues es punto y aparte, pero la que se lleva las palmas sin lugar a dudas es Terapia de Amor Intensiva, unos arreglos musicales excelsos....por favor creo que SODA STEREO se merece un poco mas de producci√≥n por parte de la compa√±√≠a de discos en sus DVD'S. Gracias."
2,Faltan Canciones,"Antes de comprar este CD baje un Torrent del Concierto a ver si valia la pena.Cuando me llego el CD, solo trae 11 canciones, es una edicion MUY incompleta del Unplugged, y lamentablemente Amazon no lista los tracks de este disco no se porque...Las siguientes canciones faltan en este CD, estoy sumamente molesto, para que pagar por el unplugged si viene incompleto????Zoom (Como puede faltar Zoom???)Cuando Pase El TemblorTerapia de Amor IntensivaDisco EternoPaseando por Roma"
3,De colecci√≥n... pero incompleto,"Si ud. es un verdadero fan de Soda Stero no puede pasar la oportunidad de tener este video en formato DVD.Desafortunadamente, si es tan fan como cree se ver√° decepcionado al darse cuenta que faltan varias piezas importantes de este concierto, entre ellas sonoman, coral y superstar.Seguramente tiene algo que ver con derechos de autor... es una l√°stima."
1,doesn't work for my white poodle,After using this product for about 2 weeks I have determined that it does not work as I had hoped it would. She still has a lot of color in her tearing that does not come off.
3,"good, when used with the angel eyes powder","works well in conjunction with Angel Eyes powder product. didn't do much until I started using tear stain remover with angel eyes. now, my white terrier looks terrific!"
4,HELP WITH TEAR STAINS FOR DOGS,"This product is pretty good, but has to be applied almost daily to get positive results. I would recommend it to those who will take the time to apply, as instructed."
4,A hotpotch of views,"This is reprint of a 1999 issue of Journal of Consiousness Studies. It contains exciting articles by stellar writers like Benjamin Libet, Henry Stapp, David Hodgson, E.J. Lowe, to name a few. It covers areas in neuroscience, quantum physics, and philosophy. Expectedly, many conflicting views are presented. The most interesting, as a matter of course, are those of compactibilism. Saying that, there are indeed also some articles which are quite obscurantist or of uncertain relevance. This cannot be avoided due to the nature of the publication. Four stars."
4,Good place to begin investigating egalitarianism,"This tiny little booklet is one of the best overall summaries on the compatibility of biblical feminism and secular feminism that there is. ""Biblical feminist"" is NOT an oxymoron. Includes brief explanations of troublesome Bible passages, such as 1 Timothy 2:12 and the ""helper"" thing in Genesis, and provides a basis for why all of God's people are equal, regardless of race or sex. It doesn't delve too deep into any one aspect of biblical feminism, but it's a great place to start."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought this as a gift for my boss hoping that it would help with his back problems because he is always having to carry around a pillow. This belt is very ""flimsy"" and really doesn't work. The belt slides down and doesn't stay put."
3,Terry isn't too bad!!,"Lots of action and pretty ladies in ""Terry and the Pirates"", and all in thirty minutes!!!"
5,Great stuff. Just release the whole albums.,"Great stuff here. I just wish they'd release the entire albums, as they've done with the ""Partridge Family"" and other classic 70's recordings.Note to record labels: ""New Season"" and ""Winning Combination"" would be great to have on CD in their entirety!! :)"
3,Navy fiancee in training...,"This book had some good information if your new to the military. However, I found there are some specifics to each branch that should have been separated. I found numerous typos and only about 70% of this book could be applied to me."
1,Bored to Tears,"Having been an Army wife for 2 years and a fiancee for 2 years before that, I am always looking to learn more about how to cope with the difficulties of military life. My mother picked up this book for me because the cute cover caught her eye. Unfortunately, the cover is the only good thing about this book.The author's tone is condescending throughout the book, and she talks down to readers, which is a real turn-off. Ms. Leyva obviously has no idea of the day to day struggles of average enlisted wives. Some of the information provided is false. [...] The book gives some cutesy information about how to act and how wonderful it is to support your man *rolls eyes*Save your money, ladies! There are better books out there that will prepare you for the real military life...not the rosy picture painted in books."
1,[...],"[...] I am an Air Force wife and after patiently reading the entire book, I found that nothing written in it pertained to any branch EXCEPT the Navy and Marines. If you are going to write a book, and name it ""Married To The Military"", you need to do just that...write about the military...ALL branches, not just the one your husband is in. IMO, Meredith should have named it ""Married To The Navy"", because that's what the book is about. [...] I give this book [...] 2 very big thumbs down!"
5,Eye Opening & Informative,"I first read this book before I married my Army husband, and I was kinda overwhelmed. After we were married, it became my handbook and it helped me save money and find money that we weren't getting!! It also helped with coping techniques while my husband is gone, that was well needed! Over all this book is well written and very user friendly. It opened my eyes to the life as a military wife even before I was in it, so I knew what to expect once I was! Highly recommend to all women associated with the military, not just spouses!!"
3,Okay book,Not a bad basic book for ladies newer to the military...but leaves a lot of questions in many places that may leave readers confused about areas of military life. There are a few better books out there.
2,Still haven't received it yet!,"SO yea, got an email asking me to write a review! I would loved to have given a positive one but I still have yet to receive my order at almost 6 weeks later! Not happy right now!"
4,Learn anything and everything!!,I think it is so important to gather all the helpful information that you can as a military spouse and this book is one of the best resources for surviving the challenges of military life.It's such a pleasure to know that people take the time to write books to help military wives out - especially since it's such a small market and probably not as easy to reach as the general public.
4,Very good!,"I am a Navy wife and even though I've been with my husband since before he joined the Navy, we only recently married and being a wife is far different than being a girlfriend or fiancee! This book wove humorous stories along with the advice and tells it like it is, and is all-branch friendly. A good start for anyone who is marrying into the military regardless of branch or rank!"
1,...,"This book was written on the assumptions of the writer and what she feels is correct information. Military wives don't need a novel based on the opinions of one Navy Officer's wife. We need accurate information in this day and age, and you'll probably find it more beneficial to just do a search on the internet. It's false, opinated and applied to all branches when it's just not possible to do that.This material is reproduced, thrown into a binder and called ""new material""....I do not recommend this book and have referred others to similar books with more realistic, accurate and helpful content."
2,A waste of time,"If you want to read a cutesy story about military wives and how to (attempt to) further your husbands career, then this is for you. If you want an actual how-to guide for figuring out how the military works and what you need to know, then look elsewhere. Sure, there was some good information. But it was lost in all of the anecdotal stories. I dont have the time nor the patience to read an entire book just to figure out what forms I need to fill out for a PCS. Also, most of the information that she DID provide is either common sense type things or things that can easily be found online. I felt that this book sugar-coated life in the military and didnt give an accurate take on things at all. It is just one womans desire to see her name in print."
1,Save your money,There are cheaper things to use to line a birdcage with. That's about all this book is useful for. The book is nothing more than a plug for the author's website.You can access more accurate and more up to date information via the internet for free.
1,Blah,This book is not really anything special because it is not very different than any of the other books out there for military wives. I find that it is mostly a vehicle to promote her website instead of giving you the true insider's view of military life. I get much better information from support websites sepcific to the branch of the military that my husband is in. It is not worth the money I spent on it.
4,Genuine Perspective,"Having been in a relationship with a military man for over 3 years, I have often been overwhelmed by everything that I do not. When we got engaged, I became nervous about how to adapt to the lifestyle that I was about to become a part of. So I devoured about seven different ""guides"" to being a military spouse, from etiquette to career advice to moving with the military- I should be an expert by now! I will say that this was one of the more honest, helpful books around this topic. It was informative about policies, standards, and general military terminology, but also had advice for communication, deployments, and learning to adapt. After reading a number of books that simply proclaimed a military wife should simply support their servicemember, this book also provided advice on how to take care of yourself, and how your servicemember can also support you."
2,I'm a military girlfriend and it didn't help much.,"I'm a military girlfriend who's boyfriend is currently deployed to Iraq. This book looked interesting and seemed like a helpful tool for me while he is away. I started reading it. I got to about the fourth page and decided it wasn't the best for me. It's more for a military spouse with children. The jargon available was helpful, but I was extremely disappointed in the overall quality of information provided. If you're looking for a good read, Separated by Duty, United in Love is an absolutely phenomenal read. THAT is a good book with a lot of advice-written so we civilians can understand the life and duties of servicemembers and it's written by a woman who's been there and seen all of it as a veteran AND as a spouse."
4,Decent - geared toward Enlisted Wives but good for all,"I am really confused by many of the reviews that I've read - almost every example that the author gave in the book was of an enlisted soldier or wife. There was little of mention of officers' wives. It was a good book in general but I would say mostly geared toward the enlisted side, which is fine. I am glad that I own it. It was an easy read - very user friendly! Hope you enjoy it."
1,Save your money...,"...especially if you are not Navy! There are many errors in her research, and the book should never have been titled Married to the Military since most of her ""advice"" and ""information"" is geared toward the Navy wife, not much to the Army or Air Force wives...."
1,no way a good book save your money,this book didnt give me any info that i didnt already know.. its all for officer's wife.. and most of the review is from people that are on there websites.. what about the struggle that military wife go through every day with a disabled child.. i took mine back and got my money back... wouldnt recommend it to anyone...
2,Solo-Ops: Survival Guide for Mil Wives may be what you need,"The pink camouflage cover should give a hint; if you're seriously looking for real life information and want it from an honestly expert source, check out Solo-Ops: A Survival Guide for Military Wives by Hilary Martin! She acknowledges all branches, and addresses real military lifestyle issues from crisis situations to daily routine in a factual, informative, and realistic way.Married to the Military, however, seems written [...] to promote the web site. Sloppy editing suggests it was rushed through publishing [...] It is a fine book for the social group it was really written for...(""look, my name is on it!""), but NOT for those of us who are looking for some real facts, a solid reference [...], and honest ""like it or not"" presentation, with an undercurrent of humorous familiarity...just like the military! [...]"
1,married to a nitwit,"This book was about as helpful as pouring salt on a wound. If you're not in the navy you're not going to get much out of it other than learning how to kiss ass. If you're in the navy, well don't follow the advice.This book is basically a plug for her website. The spouse support site is more useless than book and real support outside of the ""cyberhug"" or ""have a kid"" variety is rarely found there.If you can't think for yourself or don't want to do actual work, the book and the site are for you."
1,Not for any branch other than Navy (if even that),"I bought this book thinking it would help when my husband left for boot camp for the Air Force, I was so wrong! Not only is this book more for Navy (should be called Married to the Navy) but it is also very outdated! There are so many things discussed that doesn't even occur in the military anymore (not even in the Navy). The term ""Stepford Wives"" comes to mind when you read this book. Also it goes into how Officer and Enlisted wives should have nothing to do with each other. I, myself, have found that to be an archaic rule and no one follows it anymore! From what I can tell the book is a way of promoting her website; a website that does nothing to help military wives."
1,Save you $ your spouse works too hard for it,"I read this book a while ago, just found this site. I have to say that there are better books out there for military spouses. The author spends too much time on Navy centered information (she is a Navy spouse so this is to be expected) and much of her information on other branches is incorrect. What information she does have is readily available for free to anyone with time and a good internet connection."
4,A starter book of basic information,"I work with military wives so I wanted to see if there was information that would be helpful for me to know since I am a relatively new civilian in the military system. Some of the information I had already gotten from co-workers and some information of course is strictly for wives to obtain. I found the book to be informative and I liked the lists of websites to go to for more information. The protocol and acronyms and rank insignia will be useful to newbies as well as suggestions of things for military wives to do when their ADM is deployed. Some spouses need suggestions in this regards to planning their life as a military wife and obtaining their goals along with ADM obtaining his career goals. For wives who are not extroverts this book will be helpful. For the social butterflies, they can get most of the information by talking to Key Spouses & connecting. Overall, I did like the book and I do recommend it."
1,Unrealistic View of military life.,"The Author should be Drug out in the street and shot for writing this piece of Toilet paper. Bad information, Bad ideas, does a lot more damage than good. little girls like this author need to stay in their little holes."
2,"Its a decent book, but....",While this book may have had significance when originally penned. I fail to see how it applies to anything I've experienced in the military thus far. My advice. Don't take it seriously.
1,not worth the paper it was written on,A total waste of space. This book is a thinly veiled Naval Officers wife handbook. Nothing pertained to other services. If you read the good reviews on this site you will find they come from people registered on the cinhouse website (how convenient!!) Regular people have slated this book because it has no bearing on the modern military family. There is no information in this book that cannot be garnered from other online sources
1,The reviewers here have got it covered...,"If you don't know how to and don't want to think for yourself, this book might be useful.Otherwise? You're better off reading ""Harry Potter""...because at least JK Rowling admits to writing fiction, unlike Meredith Levya."
1,"So, no stars isn't an option?","It's not THAT bad. Really, it isn't. However, the bottom line is that it's nothing new. There is not a single thing in this book that hasn't been published elsewhere. Blah, blah, wrote book while pregnant, blah...I don't care. The saccharine sweet peeeeenk cover is annoying and the tone is condescending. When I married a Navy man, my Mother and Aunt (wife of an Air Force CMSGT and retired General, respectively) warned me about Navy wives. I didn't get it until I encountered Mrs. Levya's little book. [...] Books like this are the reason [my husband is] getting out after one reenlistment."
2,"Okay, but not for girlfriends","The book title says that it's for wives, girlfriends, and women in uniform, but I'd say it is really just for wives. And on top of that, it isn't about dealing with emotional aspects of military life, just about the logistics, such as pay, children, and housing.I'm a girlfriend, and I didn't find it helpful...maybe if I do become a wife, however, it will be more useful."
2,Where do you get a strainer?,"I ordered this fuel pump and returned it. The main reason I returned it was a notice on the box that the warranty is void if the strainer is not replaced when the fuel pump is replaced. Since I could not find a strainer at Amazon, elsewhere on the internet or locally to buy separately, I wound up buying a complete fuel pump assembly at over twice the price.The Amazon site states that complete installation instructions are included, but the one I received had no instructions with it.I sent Amazon an email detailing the two problems and they paid the shipping both ways. I do appreciate this."
4,Inspirations Only,"This book has multiple beautiful art pieces that can be inspirational for fabric artists. Do not purchase this as a ""how to"" book. Like many of Beaney and Littlejohn's booklets, this is food for thought toward your own way. Many pieces are geared toward new computerized machines with fancy embroidery patterns that can be 'distorted'. Lots of 'eye candy'...gorgeous pieces so if that's what starts your creative juices flowing...this is sure to inspire!"
1,Absolutely Atrocious,"If you require cliff's notes, then you ought not to be reading Le Morte D'Arthur. It isn't even that difficult a book. Reading the notes makes you a chimpanzee."
3,Zim can't possibly fill every crack... or can he??,"Zim's creme smells a little funky (like cloves mashed with leftover moose parts) but it works like a charm. Zim's creme penetrates your crack and leaves it moist all day. I can't say that the creme completely cured any of my cracks but about 24 hours later when I needed more creme, Zim was able to supply it. If Zim can try to smell a little better next time, his creme would get 5 stars."
5,A serious Approach to LD - Not for the Faint of Heart,This is a very dense and comprehensive resource for professionals involved with children who have learning disabilities and challenging behaviors. It is not a light read. If you wish to update your knowledge of current research on a specific topic or gain a thorough understanding of a particular set of challenging behaviors - this book can satisfy that need.
5,GREAT ALBUM,THIS ALBUM IS REALLY GOOD EVEN THOUGH ALOT OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD WERE NOT BIG HITS BUT THE PICTURES GREAT TOO.
4,Oddballs R Us,"Manhattan sleaze is a heady brew, and Upper West Side Manhattan sleaze makes for an even headier one. The narrator/protagonist of this fine debut novel is a bartender who works mids on the Upper West Side, thereby providing the stage for a goodly assortment of rogues and oddballs. (The only insufferable person in this movel is the murder victim's sister. However, she is from Massachusetts, so what can you expect?)The book is well plotted, and overall it is a very good read. (My only--and very minor--observation is that it did tend to drag here and there.)One caveat: If you are reading this book for the first time, I suggest making a little list of who's who. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, and I kept having to look back to see which was Sam the Hammer and which Eric the Red.The writer knows his territory. Enjoy."
1,Buyer Beware,"I will never do business with Powersports Superstore again. Didn't have a very good experience dealing with them. Parts that don't fit were sent and they refused to send a return label for a refund.You'll be better off finding a different company like Rocky Mountain ATV or Bike Bandit to get your parts. At least they are willing to work with their customers on returns.They wanted me to pay the return shipping on $20 worth of parts. I would be better off eating the $10 I'll lose in the long run than wasting my time returning the parts.Be careful when buying parts for your ATV on Amazon. I got the Green check mark and the ""This product fits your Machine"" when I checked to make sure these parts would fit my machine. Lo and behold the parts DID NOT FIT my machine. You're better off going with a company that specializes in ATV parts. They will have people that can help determine which parts you need and which parts actually fit your equipment."
5,Excellent through & through,"Highly recommended for those somewhat new to PIC, Basic, and robotics. Keep it center-shelf eye-level."
1,Another work from Iovine that's worth skipping...,"Like many of John Iovine's works with McGraw Hill- this one's definitely a no-go. I don't know when I'll finally learn my lesson buying his books- but I'll say it now- never again. Incomplete schematics, errors, and general garden variety stuff which we've al seen before, and not even that much of it. But that's only my humble opinion... -Paul"
1,Garbage!!!,I picked this book up and started reading the CMU camera chapter. The chapter lack depth and completeness. The author says nothing about how the image could be transmitted wirelessly to the PC or how the CMU camera communicates with the PIC. It seems that he is more concerned with selling the camera from his company Images SI than he is with writing a good book. The only useful thing that he mentioned is that you need to activate a software flourescent filter in a room that uses such lighting. But the price definately reflects the quality in this case!
5,Storyline ....,"Since Amazon didn't post an editorial review, here's the description from the back of the book to help you decide if this book is for you: ""Short of calling out the cavalry, Sophie could only do her best when it came to handling the enigmatic Maximilian Grant and his headstrong daughter. The catalog of disasters that had followed since she'd agreed to become the teenager's companion were as disturbing to her equilibrium as her new employer. Under Maximilian's autocratic rule, Sophie and her past were subjected to enraging scrutiny. Moreover, she and the arrogant Mr. Grant alternated between being defiant adversaries and would be lovers. Sophie knew there would be an explosive outcome -- but would they emerge fighting or loving?"""
1,Disc works on Realplayer only! This will cost you extra!,"I purchased this product and had the film developed. The prints came out ""ok"" but I paid additional money to get the disc in order to send the pictures via e-mail. When I tried to access the pictures on the disc I came to realize that it only works with Realplayer software. Therefore, the disc was useless to me unless I paid additional money to Purchase Realplayer software for my computer. This was not disclosed to me up-front before I paid my money for the digital prints on the disc. I cannot view the prints unless I spend additional money to purchase Realplayer. I was shocked and dismayed at this unethical business practice. This could be the basis of a good class action lawsuit againts Kodak & Realplayer."
1,deceptvie advertising at its finest,This is NOT a digital single-use camera as its name may lead you to believe. This is a regular disposable camera using regular film - you simply get a CD with it when you have it processed. Do not be misled.
1,Misleading product name,"Buyer beware!Yes, I believe the product name is very misleading. They are using a play on words to make people think it is a digital camera. It is NOT! It uses regular film.The ""Plus Digital"" is the part that they get away with... It's regular film, plus digital scanning to get a CD of your photos.So, technically, they are accurate.But morally, the name is MISLEADING. They are taking advantage of people. I will NEVER buy from them again.There are true digital ""one-use"" cameras out there. You must look hard to find them, but they are out there!"
3,disposable Digital cameras,Really not a digital camera...it only allows you to get a free CD with processing. Misleading and any standard disposable camera will do instead on paying high $$$ for these.
4,Homecoming Christmas/Christmas in South Africa,I enjoy watching the Gaither Homecoming tapes over and over. This is another good set of 2 DVD's.
5,Gaither Group Music,Loved them both with the high standard of earlier issues being maintained.The extra personal touches with the children & The Homecoming Friends were special
5,Homecoming Christmas/Christmas in S. Africa,Bill Gaither not only supplied us with great Christmas music but also showed us how to help those less fortunate individuals that don't have what we take for granted. He worked the true meaning of Christmas into both DVD's and it was most satisfying. I would recommend these DVD highly.Tiggerashes
2,Double Plaisir pour ces produits,"Premier enchantement : comme d'habitude les merveillants chants des ""homecoming friends""Et surtout le bonheur dans le regard de ces enfants tr√®s d√©favoris√©s par la mis√®re et souvent la maladieBravo !"
1,"no size listed on this item ! big fopar for ordering ,","This item seems great , however there is no size posted ! If we order we dont know if we are getting a childs play size or a standard food order size ???? List the size so customers know what they are ordering instead of being surprised when it arrives ."
3,DVD noises off,A funny story but don't expect it to be laugh out loud. Enjoyable watch but like the plot it never seems to get going and come to a conclusion. Expected a little more with the underlining story. But worth the money spent.
5,The funniest play adaptation I have ever seen.,"I haunt the local rental stores buying up old rental copies. Its the only way I could find a copy of this. Its the best surprise movie in my collection. I have, so far, succesfully launched pepsi from the nostrils of three of my friends by showing them this movie. There are NO bad performances. Thanks to one and all who made this one."
5,Hysterical!,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it years ago and only just now purchased it on DVD. The first time I watched it, at age 15 or so, I laughed so hard I cried. 20 years later, it had the same effect. As the basis is a group of actors working a farce that involves timing and nuance, this movie really brings out the best comedic skills of everyone on the cast. I'll always love John Ritter and this movie really shows off his classic skills in physical comedy. Christoper Reeve is wonderful. And Carol Burnett? I love that woman. This movie is jammed packed with really great comedians.Plus, people fall down. Truly funny prat falls really takes skill. It's all there. Watch this movie."
5,If you've ever been in a play...,"Or, for that matter, if you've ever been involved in any pursuit requiring the continued cooperation of a diverse group of people, this film will strike a chord within you. However, those who have been in a play or a musical will find these moments especially funny. The cast is outstanding- Christopher Reeve is possibly the most underrated comic actor of our time, but he's so good looking, it's easy to forget how funny he is. John Ritter is a genius at physical comedy and slapstick, and Carol Burnett plays over-the-top emotion in a completely believable way. There are no back stories or sentimentality- just rehearsing the play and performing the play. You will love it."
3,Cute but misses being hilarious,"Very slow starting, my wife got up and left one third of the way through. Cute plot that has the potential to be sidesplitting but doesn't make it. Mostly because of the director's pacing but also because the actors, while good, aren't good enough in the roles."
2,Mildly disapointing,"I had the privilege of attending a live 3 hour production of Noises Off. It was just about the funniest thing that I have ever seen. I couldn't catch my breath until the final curtain from laughing so hard.I purchased the Hollywood version to share with friends, and found that it just wasn't very funny at all. The timing didn't seem to be as good with the gags, and it was only half the duration of the live production. I expected more from an all star cast."
2,Disappointed,"We ordered this movie after seeing a hysterical local High School production that our whole family loved (ages 8 and up), and reading the reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, we were disappointed....it just wasn't that funny. Perhaps we were ""spoiled"" by seeing the live version? In any case, we passed it on to my FIL...hopefully he will enjoy it!"
2,This is humor?,I thought it was stupid and belabored and dull and boring and I shut it off before it was finished. I could see where I was supposed to laugh. Give it a laugh-track and put it on television!
5,Noises off,"This was good old fashioned humor which is exactly what I expected when I saw the list of the cast. Great to see these wonderful actors back in their prime, especially since so many are now gone. I felt like a kid again, sitting with my family on a Sunday night watching quality TV."
5,Noises Off,"I was unaware of this movie when it came out, but after reviewing its recommendation on Amazon I took a gamble and ordered it. My wife and I fully enjoyed the movie and it's cast didn't disappoint! It's well worth spending an evening in front of the TV with a bowl of popcorn and laughing to this off-beat production of a broadway production. The ending is perhaps a little light, but overall it is a fine comedy."
5,dvd,great movie loved it great price everyone should see this movie the cast is fantastick and I laughed through the whole movie
4,Noises Off,"Far and away one of the funniest movies ever! For those of us with theater experience, it really hits close to home."
3,"Very, very funny -- but HORRIBLE DVD transfer","All the glowing reviews about the film itself are right on-target. The movie is funny and the actors are perfectly cast.The DVD transfer, however, is deplorable. It looks no better than an old VHS tape. My laserdisc copy of this movie looks much, much better than the DVD version. I only bought the DVD because my laserdisc got scratched beyond repair.I recommend this movie whole-heartedly. I just wish the picture quality were one-tenth as good as the performances in the movie."
3,Been waiting for this for YEARS!,"I saw this film on cable many years ago, and absolutely loved it. It's witty and charming and very, very funny. The play within a play is incredibly amusing and the characters who put on this performance are well fleshed out. I also enjoyed watching a young and sexy Nicollette Sheridan prancing about in tight, white and tiny lingerie for a major chunk of the film.I have been collecting films for years now, and have amassed a pretty good-sized collection, but haven't been able to find Noised Off, until now. I am grateful to the Powers That Be for finally making this wonderful film available. Take my advice, and BUY IT IMMEDIATELY! You'll love it."
5,Hilarious Movie. Two Thumbs Up.,Send me an email if you need this video. i have a couple. (syberbob@earthlink.net)
5,AN EXCELLENT AND EXTREMELY FUNNY MOVIE.,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN. IT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE RE-RELEASED ON VHS.
5,Noises Off is the very BEST comedy off ALL time!!,"I've never laughed so hard in my life. This movie definately needs to be re-released!! Please, someone in the movie business, read this & all the rest of these reviews ... and RE-RELEASE this movie. I'd be the first in line to buy copies for myself & everyone I know!!! This is a MUST-see movie."
3,Great for a Laugh,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It was such a pleasure to see Christopher Reeve play against type as an insecure actor who got nose bleeds at the site of blood. John Ritter was true to form with his comedic wit and timing, as was Carol Burnett who is always a joy to watch. I was most surprised by Nicolette Sheridan as I wasn't used to her playing in a comedic role before starring in Desperate Housewives."
5,Hysterical!,"I have the advantage of having seen this in play form in London. The movie is faithful to it however, and brilliantly played by it's all-star cast. I have never laughed harder! It is truly hysterically funny. Don't miss it!"
5,From a (classic) KISS and Classical music Fan!,"EXCELLENT! I just bought this CD, and have already listened to it a half dozen times. I am a HUGE fan from the classic KISS years (1974-1979 - the years with Peter and Ace in the group).If you are a KISS fan, and also like string quartet music, you will love this. If you are a fan of either (KISS or string quartet music), you will have a better appreciation and like for both after purchasing and hearing this CD.These guys give the correct respect to classic KISS performance and it is especially seen in the string harmonies, and Ace's guitar solos in each song (except of course ""Beth"" which didn't have a solo by Ace until the ""Unplugged"" CD). The only down side of this are the songs that aren't on it, but hopefully that will mean a Volume 2!GREAT CD!"
3,Classical Kiss...,I got this for the novelty... It's different. Surely not music to consumate a relationship with.
5,Great Game!!!,"Great game!... I used to play this when i was young... had a lot of fun with it.. I really enjoyed it.. and I still love it. I give it 5 stars. By the way, the soundtrack of the game is great, and you can play the music on your usual radio since its on CDA format.Enjoy!!!!"
3,"looks impressive, but doesnt fly so hot","not the best helicopter, for an older bored college kid(ie. above 12ish). only has 2 channels, giving only vertical and yaw control. thus the best i could do was get it to hover for a 30 seconds and fly around the gym. i will however say, that it was fun and challenging, and very durable. i'd recommend this copter for a kids birthday present, where the shear thrill of lift off is enough, and control isn't a big concern."
1,a grandmothers rug,"I thought this was a plush, pretty rug until I received it. It was hard and would not unroll. The chocolate color was not at all what I expepted. It did remind me of a rug that I would find at my grandmothers house. They also had this rug in store at JC Penny. SO go check it out there before you buy. Amazon had the better price."
1,Cheap quality,"The set is really cheaply made out of plastic and is made in China. The pump on the lotion bottle keeps leaking on its own, the pump is tarnished and it's breaking apart already with very minimal use. I have to clean the counter top every day from the lotion it constantly drips (which is brown now because of the pump) I wouldn't recommend this brand of product to anyone nor will I ever buy any of their products."
3,be careful washing...,the tassels are not securely attached to the towel. I had to sew two back on after the first washing...
3,"Deadmau5 = Brilliant, Editing = Horrible","This was a great tour, I saw it live and absolutely loved him. But whoever edited this thing should be fired.The first time I saw Deadmau5 it absolutely made my jaw drop, the visuals (at least then) were like nothing I'd seen before, and the music is of course fantastic. And that's what she be focused on! Probably 50-60% of the footage on this DVD is of crowd shots, and it jumps every 4-5 seconds, like the person editing it has bad ADD. It really doesn't give you a feel for what a Deadmau5 concert is like in person, because in person you don't want to look away. There are so many little details of things going on, and you miss some much of that in favor of watching some people jump around and cheer. Why would I want to see them?If you have never seen Deadmau5 live, don't watch this. If you have and want to get a live DVD of him, get it used. It's worth a watch, but don't let it spoil a first time experience."
4,"Great, but not their best album.","I agree that Zen for Primates is a great band (even better live) but I have to say that their earlier album, Albatross, is much better. I saw them for the first time back in the early 90's in Bethlehem PA. I was only in my early teens at the time but I loved them then and I still love them now. I highly recommend picking up this album and Albatross... If you can find it.**see user posted images for cover of both albums**"
2,By Blood and Fire,"The book was represented as being in very good condition and the dust cover was ripped in multiple places. I felt that this was quite misrepresented, and would hesitate from buying from Amazon again. I have bought many books in the past through your organization.Jerrold M. Stempel"
1,Don't Bother,"This isn't worth paying for. The blindfold didn't cover well enough to fully block my vision, even after several adjustments. Additionally, the harness was simply a nuisance."
3,"""You're going to hold a dance?""","This Tom Baker adventure is an example of style over substance. The usual threat of alien invasion is dealt with in a more original way than usual, with a cosmic entity known as the Mandragora Helix planning to destroy human learning and endeavour at the time of the Renaissance, thus plunging the world into superstition and intellectual decay. Strangely enough, however, for a story set in Renaissance Italy, there is too much technobabble, especially in the climax, which is insufficiently explained. The story just ends and we're left asking how. (With no answer!) However, the story is a triumph of design. It has brilliant period costumes, lush surroundings and exquisite dance scenes during the masque. There is also a brooding sense of underlying terror. (The Doctor trapped in the temple while it is recreating itself is one such example.) There is also wonderful acting from all involved. The deficiencies of ""The Masque of Mandragora"" are overwhelmed by its sheer style."
5,This Who has it all,"A brilliantly written and acted episode. This episode has it all. Great villain, great chemistry among the cast, great buildup!!! Baker is amazing in this episode and the episode is so well paced that by the end, you will be popping out of your seat. Great episode from a fantastic era of Dr. Who."
5,Rated 4.5 -- excellent story,"The Pirate Planet (DVD) is one of my picks of Baker shows and not because of the story being by Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). It doesn't drag, there is plenty of plot, and it holds my attention. Well, we'll overlook a few set problems, but that's Doctor Who."
4,The Doctor and Roman encounter a strange planet,"The Doctor and Romana land on a strange planet while looking for the second segment of the Key to Time. They land on a planet Zanak. While this was not were they were supposd to go, they are very close. Romana get captured by the Captain, who is fighting some telepaths who feel the planet dying that Zanak is destroying for it's minerals. The Doctor and K9 led a revolt among the planet's people. Eventually the Doctor and Romana are reunited. The Doctor realizes that the planet were they heading for is really the second segment. The Doctor,Romana and K9 finally defeat the Captian and Zanak's real ruler. The telepath's blow up the Captains HQ. The Doctor and Romana get the second segment!This video has pleanty of Hichhiker jokes for fans of that series as well! It still funny even if you have not seen the series of Doctor Who! My favorite of the Key To Time series! I especially love the cliffhanger to part 3!"
2,The,"I've always felt that Tom Baker was historically overrated due to his long tenure on the show, but this story is representative of the beginning of the end of the classic Baker era.While the story itself is an interesting concept (key to time, a parasitic planet that materialises around other planets to drain them of their valuable mineral wealth), the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Blatant over-acting by the Captain, Romana still not comfortable in the role and Tom Baker looking like he has a bad case of leprosy are only offset by Mr. Feebes comic timing and the ludicrous battle between K9 and the Captain's mechanical bird!As part of the Key to Time season, it follows the format of most of the other stories in this season. Interesting idea that fails to deliver upon execution."
2,Lasted 8 months,"This is in case anyone was wondering about longevity. I purchased this to go on my leaking outside faucet that is too involved to replace. It started leaking 8 months after I put it on. I also tried replacing the black rubber O ring that came with it with a new one and that did not stop the leak, either."
2,Restricted,I purchased this product along with a new sprinkler for my garden. I noticed right away that I was not getting the coverage from the sprinkle like I did before I installed the shutoff valve. I promptly removed the valve and my original coverage returned. I now use this shutoff valve on the deck hose where I water hanging baskets and house plants where the pressure drop does not affect my watering.
3,decent,"this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection. when putting this on, you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose, right before my gilmour quick connects, so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles, i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy). it works fine, and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water, but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector."
1,This Is Awful,"I noticed in this book she does the ""mix 'n match"" approach to deities, which does NOT encourage establishing a meaningful relationship with a deity (which is what religion is supposed to be about, yes?) and she can't even get her deity information straight. She mentioned something about Freyja being a Lunar Goddess. Hahahaha! Nothing of the kind! She clearly knows less than NOTHING about the Northern deities, and would realize that Freyja is anything BUT ""lunar."" This woman is just so much candyfloss."
1,Insulting,"After years and years of effort to bring Wicca into a possition where our religion is recognized as a valid spiritual choice, this book insults everyone who has taken part in the birth and growth of our religion. The book starts off with a story which reports to be a rewrite of The Charge of the Goddess by Doreen Valiente. But in this book, everything is missing from the charge except the title. Different words, different meanings, and curious of all it is credited to Doreen Valiente who in her own books says she did not write the Charge of the Goddess (she rewrote what A. Crowley wrote based on Aradia). From there, it gets worse. It is as if the names of the founders of Wicca were thrown in just for acredation, but none of the message is present. If you want an introduction to Wicca, better to read Cunningham, Beth, or Drew and only read this one once you have a firm grasp of what it is that this book pretends to be."
2,"Poorly researched, and not written that well either...","OK, the section on divination was really good, and I say that as a professional psychic. But the book is sloppily put together, there's even a bunch of glaring typos....and some of the stuff, especially in the section on deities, is just wrong, wrong, wrong. FRIGGA is Odin's wife, NOT Freya...Freya isn't even one of the Aesir, she and her brother Freyr are the Vanir, and the distinction is important. Brigid is NOT a warrior Goddess, but a peacemaker and patron of poetry and healing. I could go on...and on...and on. These aren't just little mistakes that anyone could make (although if you're writing a book you should be held to a higher standard) but stuff that says ""I don't really know squat about this, so I'm just pulling something out of my behind."" This is what comes of using D.J. Conway as a reference."
2,Uncomfortable,"Silver Ravenwolf's hostility to Christianity made this a very uncomfortable read. The continued contemptious referance to ""Once-Borns"" was disheartening. If it is true that all faiths are equally valid and worthwhile, that includes Christianity, however much rabidly right-wing Christians would deny us that in return.Classifying three-fold law as a hold-over from Christian morality disturbed me as well. I would not recommend this book for a beginning Witch, or anyone who is curious and wishes to know more about Paganism/Witchcraft. Scott Cunningham's ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" is far, far better. Or Patricia Telesco's ""The Urban Pagan."""
5,One of the best books written for beginners into the Craft,"Raven Wolf out does herslef with this book. I have read to Stir a Magic Cauldron, and this book follows it perfectly. The reassurances and confidence that mother Raven gives you in the book is well worth the price alone. A must have for anyone interested in the Craft. MM&MP"
5,This book is greattttt!,I am a beginner in Wicca and when I read this book it helped me understand the religion and myself better. For years I have been so spiratually confused. After reading this book I knew I was on the right path. I would recomend this book to anybody considering Wicca as a way of life.I also recomend To Stir A Magick Cauldron and To Light a Sacred Flame by Silver Raven Wolf.
2,"Eh, I'd rather read Cunningham or the Farrars.","I've had this book for a few years, and just got around to reading it cover to cover. I didn't like it. There was no background info given for anything, no sample rites, nothing. If you follow the book exactly, you'll wind up with a full notebook by the end of it! She wants you to drop everything and write pages of notes all the time! I'll give this small advice for anybody reading this for the first time: Silver is not the end-all be-all of authors here. Take it with a grain of salt. Find the ways that work best for you, and take notes when it feels right to YOU."
2,Do not read until you have read...,"To understand many of the negative critisims this book you must read a few other books first:Witchcraft Today,An ABC of Witchcraft Past and Present,Fire Child: The life & Magic of Maxine Sanders 'Witch Queen',A Witches' Bible: The Complete Witches Handbook, andWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (Includes Author's Book of Shadows)."
3,just my view,"this book was pretty informative to me. I can't say that I connect with this book anymore though. I share some of the feelings of silverraven wolf about Christianity, but it's the people in the religion that is the porblem, not the religion, since people have been shoving words in Spirit's mouth for years on end. But she really does make Wicca look all sweetness and light, like nothing can go wrong and I totally disagree with some of the rules she set up in the ''Teen Witch'' book on the basic witch rules. I feel like she made them up herself. I like her sense of humor, but I currently only use the books for the important information now, like finding out about color correspondences and stuff like that. All in all, you might want to look into other pagan authors."
3,If you are going to read only one book on the Craft...,"Don't make it this one. It is not a bad book. It just stumbles in some pretty entertaining places. The mixing up of the Deities is droll if you think about it. Confusing Frigga with Freya? :-) A minor mishap on the road to life, y'all. Overall the book does teach the beginner if the beginner is willing to learn. But to learn you have to question and to question you certainly need a broader base than one book. No, it will not make you a Wiccan by going through all the steps. That is simply not possible. You must do the work in your heart and continue to do it to grow.She is a bit dogmatic at spots and tends to overemphasize her *rightness*, but hey! This was her first book. The others show her growth as a writer. Again, I recommend this to my own students with the caveat that ALL writers write from their own personal slant. Why else write? Take your salt cellar and enjoy."
4,Borrow not buy,"Four stars for good beginner content but a borrow not a buy. I would not suggest buying this book as it is very elementary. However, if you are just starting out I do suggest reading it. If you can find it at a local library or if you and your friends are all interested in learning about the craft and you can go in on it that's great. There isn't a lot of in depth information but it covers the basics."
3,Good intro but...,"This book is a good introduction to witchcraft and covers many of the basics. However, I feel as though she is trying to sell magick to the masses which, for me, cheapens the religious aspect. I am probably also slightly influenced by the fact that she put out a Teen Witch Kit (""Everything You Need to Make Magick""). I later read Green Witchcraft by Ann Moura which I enjoyed much more thoroughly. I felt as though she was trying to explain witchcraft, not sell it."
1,"Hey, She tried!","OK OK, i really don't want to put this woman down, but this book goes way to fast for the beginer. She also only uses the information that SHE has aquired, what about everything else? This is not Witchcraft 101!"
2,Problems casting Magic Missle,"This book is a great read, but it has led to some real problems in my school. Now that everyone has read this book they have all learned to cast the first level Magic-User spell 'Magic Missle'. The problem is, there is -NO SAVING THROW- against Magic Missle, so everytime someone casts it, it hits the target without fail. Now, seeing that most kids in my school only have about 4 hit points, and even a first level Magic-User who casts Magic Missle does 1d8 + 1 damage with every missle, I think you can see how this book has led to some real problems at my school.The included spell 'Cure Light Wounds' has helped to offset this problem, but even so, author's need to be more careful about the kind of info they are sharing to kids."
5,Excellent,"Overall, this is an excellent book. It provides a firm basis into witchcraf and Wicca. It is more tailored for the Witch or Wiccan rather than the Pagan, but Pagans can get a whole lot of good information from this book too. There are a few problems, but nothing somebody who reads the text carefully and thinks for themselves can't pick up on. A wonderful first book for someone entering the Pagan or Wiccan path to read, or the just plain Witch. I would recommend this book if anybody asked me."
5,Great for the Curious/Beginners,"For the just starting out, or the curious. Helpful in channeling thoughts, and getting started in meditation. For more desriptive items in the craft, please visit http://www.fmrstl.com ."
4,Pleased but needs more detail please..,"On the one hand, I adore how well this book is written. On the other hand, I am totally new to this and haven't yet developed my nose for the Craft yet. What I want to know, and have tried asking to little avail, is how is a person supposed to use the formula for holy water, with their wand,when their wand should already be consecrated according to the directions, but the book never gives directions for consecrating the wand in the first place. A bit of a runaround in a circle, which definately led me to expanding my knowledge throughout different books on the various areas not so thoroughly explained. I am chalking it up to an editor's mistake; as she was relatively thorough throughout the rest of the book. I do recommend this book, and most of the ones she's tells you at the end of each chapter to write. I am very impressed with book, I just wish it had more details."
1,LOL,"I bought this book about a year ago, thinking it might be a good reference book, or something I can use to inform my family members. Let me just say I'm glad I read it before I handed it to my dad. Aside from the numerous factual errors, she completely contradicts herself and Wicca by writing page after page of anti-Christian dribble. On one hand she preaches tolerance and acceptance of any an all and on the other she bashes Christians for their faith.This is the worst book on Wicca I've ever read, and I have quite a library."
3,"Not the worst, but....","First I would like to give a little info about myself so you know where the basis for this review is coming from. I'm an initiate of British Traditional Witchcraft, a conjure doctor, a reiki healer, and a devotee of Santa Muerte. I have 15 years in the occult. Personally I like this book. Not as a beginner book but as a supplement to living a spiritual life. The technical aspect of this book is atrocious, and almost indistinguishable as Wicca. One thing that people miss is that while Wicca is indeed a more free religion, there are definite practices that define it as such, and this book is severely lacking is that. Gardner set forth the practices that make Wicca what it is. So anyone looking to enter this religion should try to adhere to those tenets and personalize it from there. Silver ravenwolf did a good job evoking the feel of the Wiccan religion but failed on the historical and technical aspects."
5,Loved It!,"I love Silver RavenWolf! This is a fabulous introduction to the Craft! Most of come from a similar education background. The book is laid out in a true workbook format, i.e. read the theology first, then do the exercises. Silver's sense of humor is a refreshing departure from the usually terribly serious tone of books on the same subject. Rock on Sister Silver!"
4,great for beginners,"This was my second book on wicca that i bought three years ago. For the beginner it gives some history of the craft and some exercisises. I think that if you are too advanced it may come of as a bit ""cosmic foo foo"" but if you are new at this, i believe that it is a great starting point."
1,Keep Trying,Well I keep trying to find one of these books that make real sense but I think this is another one that insults the intelligence of teens who know anything about witchcraft. I don't think this book is of any use to any one that wants to really know about it.
1,Shudderingly horrid,"Everything that is wrong with many books on Wicca is embraced herein. Here is a sappy religion, with a poor theology, which seems to be based on feelings and happiness. Don't expect Ravenwolf's words to comfort you when you face loss or get you through the bad times. This is truely ""religion lite"" and not worth the money. if nothing else, the fact that her own words contradict each other every few pages should clue you in!!"
5,Simply the best,This book hs helped me more than anything else I have read (online or in books). It is simply the best book for beginners that I can think of and I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to seriously learn about the Craft. The style of her writing makes the book incredibly easy to read and informal and her writing is very interactive. An awesome book to anyone's collection
5,It's a great book for the interested.,Silver RavenWolf's book To Ride A Silver Broomstick is a great book for practitioners of paganism and witchcraft (new and old). This book gives great insight of the practices of some modern Wiccans and Pagans. I definitely recommend this book for beginning and adept practitioners because you can always use this book as a refrence to your magick notes and studies.
3,Good basics but dubious background research,"This book is a good starting point for the beginner; but it contains numerous inaccuracies which have been covered up by the author's speculations. It is obvious that the author hasn't done much research into the European roots of her subject or studied some of the earlier/current authors on the Craft. The test at the end, while being a useful tool for the reader, has become a 'set-in-stone' rule for those who do not want to experience the growth process for themselves and who enjoy setting bounderies for others."
4,Good Reading,"This book is very interesting, also really helpful..I would recommend it if you are just starting out.."
3,Non Fiction,"This is perhaps an overly simple introduction to the whole wicca thing. Depending on the cover of the edition you bought, it might seem that new generation witches do still ride broomstocks, which is pretty funny. Presumably this is intentional on her part to suck people in to picking it up and having a look."
2,Simplistic but so-so for neophytes,"To Ride A Silver Broom Stick is a milk-toast introduction to Wicca. It tends to say that almost ""anything goes"" when it comes to Wicca, and this simply isn't so. I believe it will have a tendency to confuse rather than help the beginner. Being in a coven for 16 years, I would rather recommend The Complete Book of Witchcraft by Raymond Buckland. It gives more accurate information about Wicca and actually contains some REAL ritual information...not the made-up tripe that Ravenwolf spouts"
2,Fluff and Marshmallow Cream,"Attention. If you are interested in Paganism but are Diabetic, do not, under any circumstances, purchase this book. There is not enough insulin in the world to assist you with the sugary contents. She has some decent information, but this isn't a book you read to learn about wicca, this is a book you give to your parents to keep them from being afraid, because ""anything this fluffy shouldn't be taken seriously."""
3,"It's all right, not the end-all or be-all....","...of books for Wiccan beginners. I found it a bit too rigid & uncompromising. That is NOT to say that it is not worth one's time at all. On the contrary, I learned several facts that I didn't find in other books. Just don't make this the ONLY basis for your beginning foray into Wicca. Have one or two other books at hand so you can soak in all info & discover what styles are best suited for you."
4,"Great book, has the basics, but no spells.","This book is great if you have any questions about Wicca. I am a beginning Wiccan, and I learned a lot from this book! :) A must-read!"
4,Good Beginner Book,"Ravenwolf is a good beginner's guide to the Craft; she focuses primarily on practical magic. However, this book is not a end-all souce; other books are necessary in areas such as history and some books are recommended reads at the end of her chapters. I tend to steer beginners towards this book because Ravenwolf uses a well-organized, practical approach and history is sometimes better learned in a separate volume and at a later time anyway."
4,Good beginners book,I liked the book a lot. It outlined things with out imposing her atttitudes. I've had ENOUGH of people imposing their attitudes. It was ment for beginners and was easy to understand. I like that it didn't make witchcraft a huge intimidating mystry.
2,warning: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!,"Alright, I've been studying Wicca for quite some time. Honestly, this book is all wishy washy, teeny kids stuff. It is very misleading to the novice, if one has read this book, please read other ones! There is Scott Cummingham, A Guide to the Solitary Practioner, and The Truth About Wicca Today, start off with that, PLEASE. Then branch off to other things. This book has some, And i repeat, some truth, (maybe about 1 or 2 percent at the most) But most of it is hocus pocus nonsense. There is also the Spiral Dance by Starhawk which is much more indepth. There are so many, MANY other books out there. Read one of those. I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYBODY, let alone a beginner. I don't even know if RavenWolf is a pagan. ::sigh:: Well, get some of the old stuff, there are plenty of good books out there, you just have to find the right one."
2,Serves its purpose,"I began years ago with Silver's books. Today, I don't refer back to them...well...ever. They lack the depth, or the 'meat' of Wicca as it were. I would still recommend this book to a beginner because it offers a light and easy jumping off point for someone who knows little or nothing about Wicca. I personally enjoy hearing more about a persons life experience since that tends to be unique, individual and allows me to step back and look at my own life. Silver definitely offers a lot of insight into her own experience.But I would suggest that after you've read and understood her points, and if you find yourself truly interested and looking to learn more in depth, you will shelve this book and probably never pick it up again."
3,this book is o.k.,"This book is a good to get an idea of what wicca is these days. She has taken the religion and adapted it to her lifestyle. That is not my idea of what I think religion is for. You grow into the religion, the religion doesn't grow into you otherwise it isn't the true religon. I have read many books by Scott Cunningham and Raymond Bukland and I have found this book to be a beginners book for the younger reader. If you want a more an adult and informative book on this subject I highly suggest to read a book, any book, by Raymond Buckland. He will give a more serious look at what her book was trying to get across. Overall this book is good for teenagers looking for a good path to walk on and want to dabble in wicca. It was an enjoyable book, though, and deserves some credit. Other than that, if your looking for deeper substance, shop else where."
5,AMAZING,"She introduces the craft without getting into the history to much , But she makes it clear that it is important. She is a great writer and all you people say that shes not a good author thats your thought so dont be so rude and judge. To me she wrote the section on divanation the best . All books by her are great."
4,Wonderful begginers guide,"If you're looking for a test to start your studies on Witchcraft this is a good adittion to your library. It covers many of the basic themes Wiccans need to deal and know about. Easy to read and friendly, guides to the basics on the craft. I recomend it though I feel there's something missing. Anyway is a must on your Wiccan library! You'll love it and enjoy it a lot..."
4,Wicca,This is a wonderful book for the beginner witch. It has work sheets that ask probing questions about your motives and thoughts. It also contains lists of other useful resources for further study.
2,Way too shallow,"When i say shallow, i mean it doesnt go in-depth. She DOES talk about her personal life way too much. The information in this book is too spread out and repeatative. Its completely BORING most of all. Its hard to even get into it to learn it, when it is so spread out. I dont recommend this book to any advanced practitioners, maybe a beginner could use the Ravenwolf books as a beginning guide, but even for them it will be boing and seem dull. Its so stereotypical also. As if everyone does the same thing, it doesnt over much of a broad perspective on choices of specific knowledge. Basically all of the silver Ravenwolf books are like this."
3,Not as bad as you might have heard.,"This book gets a lot of bad press, but it's really not a bad secondary introductory text although I don't think I'd suggest it as a sole source. Throughout the book, information is supported by exercises to strengthen the student's understanding of concepts, and most chapters end with a useful list of further resources, making it an excellent book to study systematically. It might be a little much for an absolute beginner, but anyone with a little research under their belt should have little problem understanding everything in it. Ravenwolf presents a wide variety of practices that can be part of Wicca or Witchcraft; one strength of this book is that it gives a good idea of how flexible the practice of eclectic Wicca can be. I think the biggest flaw is that it's a little scattered, and not as cohesive as some other introductory books. However, as one of several sources I think it's fine."
2,"SWEET BEGINNING, SOUR AFTERTASTE","During the first pages, I loved that book and I said to myself: Thats IT !! The youthfull and down to earth style (so I thought) seduced me and ""sucked me in"". But after a while I got tired of it. Silver is pretty restrictive, considering that WICCA is an relatively open path. Her way of tarot is right ( I do it for years and I wouldnt change my layout), and also in other things she seems pretty close-minded (like the Farrar-Couple). The ""hammer"" is her story with the deer: how can you try to influence a hunt? Thats pretty against my personal view of WICCA. Silver influences a lot of teenagers (those who love ""Charmed"" and stuff like that), espescially with her new books. Thats okay, but PLEASE if you read only this book/author TRY some books of SCOTT CUNNINGHAM. At least he wrote from his heart."
3,Strictly for beginners,"I am another reader that has mixed feeling about Silver Ravenwolf style of writing. I bought this book about two years ago, when I was just starting off, I thought It was a wonderful source of information. It provides a little history, gives some usefull suggestions on building your book of shadows, and discusses the basics of spell casting and rituals. But a good book to me is something that I want to keep and find myself going back to time after time. This book was not one of them. I attempted to read it again and it was something like trying to read a Childs book as an adult, faintly entertaining, just not at your level. Definitely a beginners book, for those who have yet to seek their own way in the craft."
3,Ho-Hum,"This book has a lot of good information. I don't like the idea that it targets teenagers, however. It has a sort of ""add water and stir"" approach to becoming a witch that I think is a little simplistic. Anyone wishing to explore the craft would find this book useful, but a lot of other reading would be necessary."
3,"The Language of ""Broomstick""","This book has absolutely TONS of information as well as very practical exercises for those who want to jump in and get their hands dirty with actual witchcraft. I must admit, however, that I find Ravenwolf's writing sometimes condescending to the reader. It is very much ""down-to-earth"", which is always helpful, but perhaps the writing style is just a bit too casual for my taste. If you don't mind the writing style, however, and want to dive into some practical wicca, then this book is for you."
5,THE BEST I HAVE SEEN YET,"I have read this book and found it to be one of the best and most enlighting books I have read on Witch Craft. It touchs on almost very aspect of the Craft and lists books which can be read for more in depth detail on the subjects. There are also lessons that can be done to perfect meditation, keeping records of rites, visualization... it is a MUST for a new comer or even for those who have been in the craft for some time"
4,Not Bad For Newbies.,"I first read books by Silver RavenWolf when I started practing Withcraft and she got me going in the right direction, but that's about it. If you're not new to the craft this book is so-so but for anybody intrested in the Craft this book is pretty good. (and Teen Witch, one that isn't bad for yougish witches ^_^ )"
5,Better Than Buckland,"Alright, I was trained on Bucklands book, but this is the BEST I have read so far. The easy writing style reads like a charm and it is very hands on as well. EXTREMELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
3,Brill for beginners,I have all the Silver RavenWolf books. While they are good books I find that sometimes they dont fully cover the darker side and how easy it is to slip in to it. It is good for beginners as it is a through book but not boreing also you can flick to the bits you like best however I feel her teenWitch Kit is to comercal and I have lost faith in her since it cane out
2,Nothing to get excited about,"I admit I came into this book with high expectations but I was a little disappointed. It's an okay book... I could have done without it. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. For that, try Scott Cunningham. He really comes out through his printed words. It feels like you are having a conversation with him (however one sided it is :-) ). Mrs. RavenWolf writes like she's writing a school text book. Blessed Be."
3,GO away if looking for mythos and theology of wicca,This book is not a very good one. It deals with almost entirly magickal operations and know how. This is good for people into New Age stuff and if I was revieing for New Age people I would give it a 5. For those interested in the Craft go Away!!!
3,"""Wicca 101""?","Ms Ravenwolf has a friendly writing style that is easy and lucid. The beginner will be drawn in and be engaged by it. The more experienced Crafter might be a bit put off. Be absolutely clear: this is a novice's book, and a young novice at that. Still, everyone must begin somewhere and this book is not a bad place to start. Parents can be assured that their teens aren't learning how to hex people.The methodology is Wiccan, so that might not be what everyone is looking for. (Not all Witches are Wiccans, remember.) This is practical instruction presented in a non-pedantic way - a good beginning that lays the foundation for more serious books later."
1,not worth it,"This book has much false and misleading information in regards to practice, history and ethics. It is a book that encourages teens to hide their ""religion"" from their parents rather than respecting their wishes and learning about what is put in front of them, or teaching them to confront these issues. I am a practicing Wiccan and feel this book is a disgrace to the pagan community. This book, and any written by SRW is not recommended by me."
1,Don't Bother.,"It's Silver Ravenwolf at her finest.. meaning it's still not worth your time.If you want a watered down wicca manual that's inaccurate at vital points, this is the book for you. If you feel like investing your time wisely, go to another author. Any other author than her."
4,What's wrong with fluffy bunnies???,"I keep hearing mention of SRW and bunnies. I like bunnies. They're cute. I don't quite get the fluff bunnies stuff, so if someone can explain, please do. I dig this book, its cool if you're like me; raised a Catholic (oooh...) and now a Witch. I like all of her books, as a matter of fact. They are interesting and informative. I just don't get some of the reviewers on here. So what if she has a hunting spell? Yeah, the Rede says ""Harm none,"" but if you take that too seriously you may as well call yourself a fluffy bunny. Literally, are you going to starve yourself because eating lettuce kills a plant? C'mon people. I left Catholicsm because I was sick of the hipocrasy I encountered there. Don't you think harsh words go against the Rede? Think before you type. Anyway, this is a good book for beginners, or anyone who wants a fresh look at the Craft. Blessed Be!"
2,Too fluff,"What is a fluffy bunny? Well, to know that you must have a living example of it by reading one of mrs ""Silly Raven Shmuck"" books! When every single serious pagan/wiccan tells you not to buy a book by this woman please do so and don't make the same mistake I did. Ravenwolf writes for excited teenagers who are just involving themselves in witchcraft or wicca and writes in a very snobby way what you have to think, do and how many steps you need to take before turning to the next nonsense page. She makes fun of every people who don't think like her, she actually has a spell for BETTER HUNTING, c'on! She even makes fun of her own readers! This woman doesn't respect witchcraft nor wicca nor paganism and is just looking for the money every teenager leaves on every one of her bad books.If you are just beggining please adress cunningham, thea sabin, or even grimassi for a change! If you want to start seriously, if you really love your path and want to respect it, start serious, not with this."
4,Silver's book is great for beginners,"i never really got to finish the book, but i read more than half of it and it was great. I borrowed the book from a friend and she needed it back before i could finish it. i just started studying the craft over the summer and this book is great for beginners. I learned a lot from it. Well that's all I have to say about the book. Bye."
2,Alright for beginers,"This is a very basic book. If you have common sense, or any knowledge of wicca, then this is probably not for you. All the information in this book I've seen thousands of times over in different books, and it wasn't even put into a very different light. If you are a very beginer, then this would be the book for you. If you have never read a book on wicca, then I would suggest this one, as it is easy to read and covers the basics."
4,Very educational book,"I only found that a few details were skipped over, but all in all, a good read. She presents the material the same way that a good friend or mother would."
3,This would have been five stars five years ago.,"This was my first book on ""witch stuff"" and I'll always remember it with a certain amount of affection. However, there are a lot of things here that are just WAY off (Freya = Frigga? I think NOT!), and her carelessness with historical fact can't be offset by her carefulness about ethics. Especially since I, personally, believe that carelessness about historical facts in a book meant to appeal to a wide audience IS a bit unethical.If you're a complete newcomer to things pagan, you'll either love or hate this book -- I rarely hear of any middle ground. If you're something of an old hand, you'll love it, hate it, or feel a certain amount of affection for a ""beginner's book"" while trying to steer your own new coven/kindred/grove/etc. members to something a little higher quality."
3,It's Okay,"This is the first book I actually sat down and studied when I became interested in Wicca and Paganism. It's not a bad book for beginners, though I would recommend reading some of the classic books and authors along side of it to get a good broad look at the religion.My main complaint is that while this book has useful stuff to get one started, I got the feeling that having elaborate rituals and a bulging closet of tools and notes was nesescary to be a good pagan. Looking back, I also find refering to Christians as ""once borns"" is insulting to one of their core beliefs, but you wouldn't know that from reading the reason for using the term given in the book. Finally, this book sooo needs better cover art! It's hard to take a book seriously when 'Spell Caster Barbie' is on the cover."
3,witchcraft 101,"I have read this book and i must say that it is a must if you are going to ""break"" into the craft....but be warned...she doesn't tell you to close off each of the watchtowers in her dedication ritual...and also she asks you to cast a magick circle before you even read how to do it..it isn't discussed how to do it until further chapters. This could be very dangerous to leave theses gates open. this book is great but before you do and thing with opening and closing a circle do reseach with other books and ask someone who is knowledgable in the craft first. But this is a great book all in all, and silver ravenwolf is an excellent author..."
1,Ewww. Trash.,"I am saddened to think that this book is what most beginners start out with (myself included). I bought this book years ago, thinking I found a great introduction to Wicca and Witchcraft. Boy, I am glad I took most of the ""information"" in this book with a grain of salt. Saying that Millions of women were killed because of their beliefs isn't even the most stupid thing in this book. No, believe it or not...millions of people were NOT burned at the stake! Her disdain for Christians makes my blood boil too. How can, in one of her lame 'lessons', can she promote peace and understanding and then turn around and claim Wiccans are oppressed by Christians? Give me a BREAK!Silver Ravenwolf gives Wiccans and Witches a bad name.If you are a beginner there are other books that are better than ANY dribble I have read by Ms. Ravenwolf. Hell, even the watered-down Idiots Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft is better.Please...save your money."
1,Fluff stuff,"$ilver kind of makes Wicca look bad, no wonder so many people look down at wicca as some make believe religion when $ilver is one of our best selling authors. But you know her critics as well as her fans contribute to her cash pile. Her books should have never made it as far as they have today. I keep thinking that since she has studied for so long and had so much time to figure things out, that maybe she'll finally write a good book. But have been wrong time and time again as $ilver continues to put out her repetitive material.I would not suggest any of her books to any one, especially not to beginners because the beginner is most prone to take her words for matter of fact and not just a old fluffs opinion."
4,Good background info for practice,"I think this was a very good book. And even though she skips to a new subject every few pages, I think that is because she just wanted to give some background about a few things. I also like the suggested reading list."
5,This is a great book for begginer witches and advanced !!!,"This book is an excellent book. It is extremely easy to understand, and you don't have to read every page. you can jump around if you like!!! I have learned so much from this book and I reccomened it to any beginner witches!!! This book contains so much info that it amazes me. There is so much you can do with the spells it teches you and the spells actually work!!! I reccomend this to anyone interested in the craft, it is an excellent book."
3,You'll find what you wish to in this book.,"There is always a piece of the truth you seek in all things that come to you. I truly found what I needed from this book, gleened it and left what was not mine. Not all truths will be mine but surely what I need will come as it is needed."
1,Life is too short to spend time on this book,"This book contains nothing of worth that hasn't been said already and better. I am concerned that so many of these reviews say that it is good for beginners. Why learn something that you are going to have to unlearn later? Be wary of something that is too easy. Better books are Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon, Stewart Farrar's What Witches Do, Stewart and Janet Farrar's A Witch's Bible, Raymond Buckland's The Complete Book of Witchcraft, Starhawk's The Spiral Dance, and Scott Cunningham's Wicca for the Solitary Practitioner. If you read those books you will be able to see just how poor Ravenwolf's books are. Don't waste time on cotton candy when there is steak and potatoes out there."
2,RIDDLED WITH MISINFORMATION,"Silver RavenWolf's ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" is, like most of her other titles, riddled with misinformation and personal opinions that are presented as ""facts."" It is poorly researched and insulting to the intelligence. RavenWolf's attitude toward witchcraft seems to be ""make it up as you go along and dispense with the facts if they happen to get in the way."" Scott Cunningham is a better author to consult for more accurate info on Wiccan theology. And for folk-magick and spellcasting without emphasis on religion, I'd recommend Gerina Dunwich -- especially her ""Exploring Spellcraft"" which is excellent for both the beginner and intermediate occult student."
1,This book SUCKS.,"The book is horrible, along with all of her other ones. It's completely unrealistic and she just wrote it to make money. I can't believe I wasted my time on this."
1,Well....the drawings were nice......,"This is the kind of book that makes you want to ask the author ""How stupid do you think I am?"" It seems more like the faith movement in Christianity then Wicca, and she seems to think that the God and the Goddess are just waiting to do her commands. Many of the concepts (astral projection, finding your familiar) are too advanced for beginners, but at the same time, if you know anything about Wicca, parts of this book will be very annoying. This review is not long enough to talk about all the things that were wrong with this book. ""The Spiral Dance"" by Starhawk and Scott Cunningham's books are signifigantly better reads"
3,"Good, but that doesn't cut it","This book is good, but not soooo good. It's got good information, but most of the book is just blabbering, informative blabbering, but still blabbering. This book needs some spice, instead of just boring, dull information. I mean, the first half of the book is about kinds of traditions, and wiccan history, and list of gods and goddesses- which is good information, just not what you would expect from a book that's supposed to teach you the Craft. If I wanted a book about history, factions whithin Wicca, or Gods & Goddesses, I would buy one particularly suited for that. So in conclusion, this book can be a nice addition to your Wiccan library, yet it will not be an integral part of it."
5,much info,"This is a very good book. It will tell you alot..how to get started..and so on. If you are new to Wicca,,i would suggest this book. It leads you in the right direction..then you can choose how and where you will go with it"
1,insulting to witches,"pure junk from the queen of the fluff bunnies, how dare she reduce the craft to basket weaving 101, a self proclaimed grand puba of yet another mass produced llewellyn non-sense book, sliver-raven-twit is an author not a witch, and not helpfull to the real witchcraft community."
1,Faery Tale,"This book did absoutely nothing for me. It approaches Wicca in a very ""casual"" way. The only use I believe this book could server would be to find better books on Wicca. Scott Cunningham's books beat this one out, 10 fold. This tripe is everything Wicca does not need, which is a fantasy, spell work, hocus pocus type writing. If you are seriouly concidering walking the Path with the Goddess, then I suggest you start elsewhere.Blessed Be, Dallan"
1,True Garbage,"I truly feel sorry for teens or anybody that buy her books. They are such a waste of money and time. Trust me, there are better books than this one and any of Silver Ravenwolf's books. I truly do say that she is a great writer, however, her ethics on teaching wicca and magick made me puke. Yeah!..she'll teach you wicca alright, but, ""her wicca""...once again its that ""my way or the highway"" feeling again. Very sad, if you want true wiccan books there are many to choose from; from other well respected authors that are better. Ravenwolf books i DO NOT RECCOMMEND at all, cause her view points on wicca and magick are just awful."
3,Hmmm...,"I like her books, they have some good information but...they seem to be aimed at teens who want to rebel. It's like she's giving them a way to be opressed and misunderstood....."
2,A Mediocre Introduction to Wicca,"Having just come off the high of reading Starhawk's ""The Spiral Dance"", I was enthusiastic about reading this selection from one of the most popular names in modern Wiccan writing. I was rather disappointed. Ravenwolf's authoritative tone combines with her disjointed writing style to make a book that is difficult to read and contains mediocre content. Additionally, the tone she adopts makes it seem as if her version of Wicca is the only version and all others are nonsense. I found this attitude repugnant from a wiccan author. Some of her rituals are good along with some sound advice from time to time, but don't make this your introduction to modern Witchcraft. You'll be disappointed. There are much better books to read first and much better authors to learn from. After reading this selection, I found myself surprised that Ravenwolf is so popular. Personally, I won't be reading any more of her work."
1,Barbie Is A Witch And Ravenwolf Wrote the Book For Her!,Llewllyn is famous for really bad books and this book is one of the absolute worst. Thank you Llewllyn for sticking a Barbie on A Broomstick on the cover and thank you Silver Ravenwolf for watering down Craft principles for mass production. All the nutritional substance of a twinkie. If youre a crystaltwinkie then this book is DEFINITELY *your* cup of brew!
2,Bit of a Bore,I found this book oversimplified the spiritual side of wicca. She tells us so many stories of her life and her experiences with witchcraft that you lose interest in the real content. I also found this book very rigid in what Ravenwolf feels you can and cannot do in wicca. One of the reasons so many people are attracted to wicca is because it is so open to personal interpretation. One's faith is not dependant on having the right sections in you Book of Shadows or the right herbs in your collection. Not the best book for beginners and a bit of a bore for anyone with any experience in wicca.
5,My First!!,"As a child I went to chatolic schools, but I still believed in magic, faeries, and witchcraft. When I was confirmed I was TOLD to forget such""foolish"" things. I knew that talking would get me punished. But no one could make me forget what was in my heart. It was until my freshman year of high school that I was looking in a bookstore and stumbled upon the New Age section and found and studied this book. I BELIEVE that: You do not find Wicca, it finds you. Either by being Hereditary or by Fate. Later I found out that my Great Aunt practices also!! We now share secrets and are closer than ever!The Goddess has BLESSED me.. May She DO THE SAME FOR YOU!!"
3,"Decent, good for beginners","Not a big Silver fan as a rule, I prefer Scott Cunningham, but this book is a good one for a beginner. Does a good job of touching on all the various topics a new witch should be familiar with."
5,yet she does it again,"she is one of my fairote authors of the craft, because she does stuff her own way. what is so wrong with think with your own brain. this was a great book even though, i did not read until after to stir a magick cauldron."
2,Well it helped me see teh diffrent types of witchcraft.,Way to fluffy and over cerimonial. While reading the book I felt as if I was being preached to and not informed. And it toped it off with one of ehr personal concoctions made out of hot sauce and peppers to magickly clear out you system if you feel like you are coming down with any thing. The only thing this would do is have you live on the toilet for a day. At least it would empty you out. This did it for me and I couldn't take another word she rote seriously.
2,I am not sure if I like this book,This was book was ok but I felt like she kind of ignored the Goddess and her importance in the craft. I didn't like all of her spells either because some of them seemed like bad karma to me. I've been studying/practicing Wicca for over twenty years and for some reason I am not crazy about this book.
3,Preachy and condescending but useful,"The tone of this book grated on my nerves. Felt too preachy and somewhat condescending to me. It does have some useful info though. I agree with the person who said the rituals featured here are overly detail-oriented. A ""script"" for rituals is useful to beginners, but for that reason, it should be a simple script. Silver Ravenwolf also seems to aspire to be the Martha Stewart of witchcraft, with her black-cat stenciled kitchen boarders. In any case, I have been a solitary for 11 years, and tend to find most Llewellyn texts to be good very basic introductions. This book is no exception, and I would recommend that a beginner at least look over it."
2,More history than spells,I thought the book was very informative about the craft and history but the spells were not there?? Good to learn about the craft but not for use in spells.
1,Horrible!,"Please do not purchase this book. It is horrible and rediculous! Ravenwolf is a joke. There is no other way to say it, she is simply a joke. If you are interested in REAL witchcraft, then look into purchasing Ray Buckland's books. He is a living master!"
2,"Good lighting for a cheap price, but you may get what you pay for","My commute to and from work is about 32 to 45 minutes each way. There is no warning before the light goes out; it's very bright and then there's nothing. I could live with the short battery life since my commute time is short, but the unit did not even last a season. I saw smoke emitting from it before it ""died."""
4,Sigma resembles somewhat a Mirage at the end of the Track,"As a first time off road MTBiker, I found this product very accomodating. The bonus was the mounting system. IT was easy to install and remove and versatile too. I was able to change it from my MTB to my road bike with ease and under 62 seconds.My only gripe was the adapter. As it had an american 110v adapter , plugging it into a 240v Australian outlet is not the best thing to do. Somehow when you do plug it, you start to smell smoke very quickly followed by a brief lightning show. The best way to alieviate this is to purchase a 7.5 outlet, pull out the soldering iron and go to work. So far so good.David."
5,Very good quality!,I used this as a banner behind my one year old's highchair while he had his first birthday cake. Aside from being a great back drop it will make a great party flag for future events at our house. This looks like it will hold up well outdoors.
3,Ehh. Disappointed.,"This game turned out to be pretty boring. Lots of pixel-searching required in order to advance. Ending is pretty weak. Low difficulty, except for the pixel-searching."
3,Very interesting character this author.,I have a review elsewhere I think. The book is entertaining in the brief small room sit down sense. Lots of trivia and interesting gossip and revelations. However the main flaw is that it is literally drenched in the Homosexual agenda to the extent that we are to believe that homosexual pianist performers select different programs than NORMAL pianist performers. Bit of a stretch wouldn't you say?
2,"A very ""thin"" book as to technical content.","If a person buys this book for any reason other than conspiracy themes, he will be disappointed. There is virtually nothing about how a sniper would set up his shot or the hardware he would use. Very little technical content at all. It seem most of Roberts books are this way"
3,A sniper's view.,"This book is a sniper's look at the assassination and the scene.Mr.Roberts theory of ""crossfire"" or ""triangulation of fire"" is excellent,especially considering his military experience.I think he may be correct about the location of the hit teams.Were the hit teams made up of a Corsican assassin and a member of ZR/Rifle? The author isn't the only writer that has offered that theory.Craig Roberts theory about what happened to the President's body aboard Air Force 1 is intriguing! His investigation into the aircraft and strange activity related to the flight was good also.What is debatable is the identity of those responsible for the murder.It seems most likely that the mafia was working with the CIA to committ the crime with J.Edgar Hoover working for the mafia to cover it up.This book is worth reading for the insight offered by the author considering his experience and knowledge."
1,STUPID! No print option,"Dumbest product I ever bought. What is the sense in buying ""sheet"" music if you can't get it on to a sheet of paper. Am I supposed to buy a Kindle and put it on my piano? I'll never buy sheet music from Amazon again."
2,"Meditation yes, but not medical science","This is an excellent book about Kundalini Yoga techniques and the chakra system. There are many great exercises. But there are no endnotes, footnotes or references to any scientific studies. The author has a medical degree but none of the techniques in here have been tested in scientific studies. That doesn't mean that they don't work medically. But the title of the book and the ""M.D.,"" after the author's name implies that there is something scientific going on here. There is not."
2,Not worth the money,"My expectations were high for this book based on the previous reviews. Unfortunately, it was an exercise in redundancy. Entire chapters were attempts to stretch a singular point well beyond the amount of words it requires to actually communicate the point. When useful exercises and figures were finally included in the book, they were nothing more than could be found for free in a basic web search. The rest of the pages were filled with insistence that this is science in a quantity so over the top that it reads as desperation to convince rather than a simple assertion of facts. Save your money and just do a google search."
1,Too much unnecessary detail,"The book is interesting but unfortunately it is too much chit-chat without any substance. That extra chit-chat stuff badly bloats the size of this book. The author is knowledgeable and very intelligent. However because of the unnecessary chit-chat, it becomes a pain to keep up. If he kept things just to the point, it would be a much thinner book and it would help the modern day busy individual. Most people do not have that much time in their lives. It has 292 pages. But 180 pages or so is redundancy and useless chit-chat like ""In your hands you hold a book that can change your life"", ""the desert wakes up in the night and sleeps in the day"" etc etc. This is useless stuff"
5,review,A book which guides you deep into meditation and reveals its healing effects. Can help to build up your own practice or help to find a suitable meditation for your students.
4,First step to kudalini yoga,Very interesting perspective on health and Kundalini yoga. It led me to buying several Kundalini Yoga DVDs by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett. Time will tell how effective this practice is. Heard the author on a Deepak Chopra radio show and a thought he made sense
5,RAZOR,THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. THANKS FOR A RAZOR WITH SHARP EDGES AND NO CUTS ON ME IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.
2,Worst blade system I've ever used,"Given that another reviewer thought that this was the best blade he'd ever used, I have to assume that it's designed for a very specific kind of beard. I do know that it's not designed for mine (which I consider average). While it did a decent job on my cheeks I had to go over my neck time and time again to get it smooth, and had the same problem with my chin. Part of the problem may have to do with the design of the blade, which prevents you from rinsing out the stubble by running water through the blade. It therefore clogs very quickly.The only plus side, and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one, is that the design does seem to make it harder to nick yourself than others. For that reason I can only recommend the Quattro to people with very sensitive skin or those new to shaving."
2,Water drops stay on the car,"It is supposed to be self drying, but the water drops cling onto the car like little koalas. Before I tried out the Simoniz brand, I had been using the RainX self drying car wash. With RainX wash, the drops would trickle off when I drive the car around the block (my version of jet-air drying). Not so with this brand. I am wondering what is special about this chemistry."
2,simonize does not dry streak free,"I was disappointed with this product. My windowes were all streaked after dring. the paint was fine but not the glass, I won't buy it again and will try something else instead."
1,Provides a liberal slant on the Bible,"This study Bible gives the ""standard"" liberal perspective on the books of the Bible. It casts doubt upon the authorship of the books and their accuracy, which in my opinion undermines the Christian Faith. I doubt that the early Church Fathers would approve of much of the commentary in this Bible. The meat of the notes is in the Readers Guide at the front of the Bible, instead of with the books it is commenting on. This may require the reader to go back and forth from the book to the notes at the front, which I found annoying. If you want a liberal slant on the Bible you may enjoy this Study Bible. If you are a traditionalist you should look elsewhere."
3,Catholic Study Bible,"I was a little disappointed in this purchase. First, I misjudged the print style (semi-italic ?) and light. Second, in the colored maps section, several maps were messed up in the printing process (i.e., mechanical process) making essentially useless."
3,Disapointed,"This Bible is not a Leather version, just hardcover and no dust jacket either. It is tabbed which is great, but words of Jesus are not in red. Entire text is in black, commentary and actual Scriptures are in black, just different font size. Difficult to read."
1,Catholic Doctrine Undermined,"Although this study bible is presented in an academically erudite manner, it undermines the doctrine of the Catholic Church. With a decided liberal bias, this book will not aid the individual in understanding the bible from a Catholic perspective and might harm their Catholic faith, despite its imprimatur. Do not let this 'wolf in sheeps clothing' misinform you and falsify your convictions. I will not go on to exposit the deficiencies other than to indicate this book is replete with self-serving academic rhetoric that is dogmatically iniquitous.I would recommend the Navarre study bible as a nonpareil alternative."
4,Worse things happen at sea. Sometimes.,"Michael Jecks continues with is impressively well-researched medieval murder mysteries with ""The Death Ship of Dartmouth,"" and this time takes the reader into the worlds of fourteenth-century England's seafaring commerce, abusive royal power, and the well-earned pride of the people of the critical port town of Dartmouth. Pirates and storms threaten the lives of Darmouth's sailors; but, Jecks deftly shows that what happens on shore can be just as deadly, and that in a corrupt age representatives of an Englishman's own king's cronies can be more blood-thirsty than any Breton pirate. A particularly gratifying quality of this tale is its demonstration of the redemption and significance that can be in store for medieval life's seemingly lower players, be they street pavers or criminals abjuring the realm."
5,"Very concise, focus on intuition","As an MBA student at Kellogg School, I find this book is concise and easy to read. It also teaches me the intuition in derivatives and asset pricing. As it has both basic and advanced material, it can be used as a reference book as well."
4,Otro exito de Alberto Vazquez Figueroa,"Es un libro lleno de emocion y aventuras que ensena el espiritu die supervivencia del se humano y resalta la grandiosidad del Gran Rio y lad selva del Amazonas,realmente bueno..."
1,Made in China and Not the US like the listing states,"I did my homework and noted that product users noted a difference between the contents that were manufactured in the US and those that came from China. I specifically went with a listing that stated that the product was made in the USA. Bought it from BIGFLYSPORTS and the container clearly says ""Made in China"". I'm very annoyed with this misrepresentation."
3,scentsless,"I'ved used the coty loose powder for yrs, loved the scent! Where did it go? I can't smell it at all, now. Thought I just got a bad one, so I ordered another one! That was the main reason I bought it was for the scent! Gaaaa! It's really scentsless! Please bring it back like it was!!! How can they screw up a classic scent so severely????"
4,face powder,this is a good face powder and just bought it because I remember the brand from my past; it works as well as any out there
2,Powder with a smell!,"Good product, excellent price, BUT what a strong smell. I can SMELL wearing the powder, which is quite annoying."
1,Not the product you bought before,"I was so disappointed when I received this product. It has different packaging, different ingredients, and different fragrance. It is also a different color than the last package of Translucent Coty Airspun that I bought. BEWARE! You will not receive the product that is pictured. It is a different formula, made in China. Finally, the ""powder"" is almost gritty compared to the old, made-in-U.S.A. product. I will be returning this and will not buy this product again. The bar code is the same, but that's the only thing that is like the old, trusted Coty Airspun powder."
5,Roman Empire,"The earliest written histories belong to Egypt, but it's Italy's expanding Roman empire that usually sparks the most interest because of it's sheer size. They were said to have brought civilization with their roads, aqueducts, baths, and soldiers. The Hellenization of the world with the spread of Greek philosphy influenced the Romans whose system was then adopted by both European and US government's (are based on Roman law).I wanted to try different authors who were describing their own time period (first-hand accounts) but had poor sources for early time periods. The fall of the republic and the creation of emperors to lead only because of the divisions in the senate. 100BCE"
4,"It's not lo-fi, it's just straight forward CHAOS!","This is a must-have CD. The Modey Lemon got me hooked with ""You Bug Me"", and perhaps the only reason I gave this 4 stars was because that track wasn't included here. The whole disc is just plain ol' heaps of ruckus and energy, something that is SEVERELY lacking in music of all genres! What these two guys do with some pots and pans, one throat, one guitar, and a moog mg-1 is not only disturbing but inspiring. Recommended tracks on this CD: Caligula, It's Hard, Coffin Talk, but the whole disc is great, really, and makes me proud to live in Pittsburgh."
4,Very Cool Product,"That sums up my reaction and the reaction when others see me whip out my lightWedge. I actually bought the one I'm reviewing for an astronomer friend of mine who seems to love it. I bought my first one two years ago, its the one for paperback books, and it is one of the most useful gadgets I've purchased in a long time. It simply works, the batteries last a long time, and most importand of all - my wife and I can remain married even though I need to wake up and read in the middle of the night sometimes, and she's a light sleeper. All of the LightWedges are great products and I would highly recommend them. Why only four stars? I wish I could get red in any LightWedge size instead of just the one."
1,extremely dissapointed,"When I lost my regular lightwedge which i absolutely loved, I decided to give the nightvision a chance. the red color does not spread evenly when you turn it on so there are darker almost blackish red areas that are hard to read. I suggest you stay with the original lightwedge. Waste of money."
3,Good for bedtime reading but scratches easily,"PROS: It does a nice job lighting up the page without distubing your spouse.CONS: I saw other reviews that noted how easily this item could get scratched up. I decided to order the accompanying bag to prevent damage. I was very careful with it, ensuring that I didn't just leave it laying out on a table and kept it in the bag when not being used. Unfortunately, I still wound up with quite a few scratches. Also, I didn't care for having to always hold the light wedge in place. I ended up giving it away to a friend and bought a Sony Touch and the reader cover with the light."
2,To dim to read by,"We really enjoyed the original LightWedge and were buying a 2nd one. I picked the red, NightVision LightWedgeLightWedge NightVision LED Booklightwith the idea that it would be less obtrusive to my wife when she was trying to fall asleep. That worked as planned, but unfortunately it is also too dim for me to read by comfortably. It might work for reference material if night vision were important, but not for reading a story or similar text. I will buy a 2nd, original LightWedgeLightWedge Original Book Light (Black). It isn't too obtrusive and is easy to read by.--Scott"
1,LightWedge NightVision -- Not good,"I thought the LightWedge NightVision would help my wife read at night without a bright normal light. When I got it, we tried it and found it not effective at all -- just a red light without lighting up the page.John"
1,Poor Design,"Had to return this product. Battery compartment too short for batteries. Therefore, batteries could not be inserted and product was useless."
5,Easy to read and straightforward,"I have already begun to apply the ideas I have learned in communication to solve problems. The ideas, discussions and diagrams found in The Basics of Speech Communication will remain with me forever. In the beginning I was intimidated by the people who I thought were smarter than me. Now I understand that with effective communication skills those barriers won't stand in my way."
3,Question,"This is more for the site-owners rather than a review. There is nothing on your ""Contact Us"" page to message you with private questions, so this seemed like the best if only way to ask. I am interested in the Decepticon - Logo Ribbed Tank Top. Do you know when a small size will be available?"
1,OMG Do not buy,"This is just an incredibly pathetic movie. Filming, directing, acting, even the rock climbing is pathetic. We couldn't even watch the whole thing. Really nothing good to say about it all."
5,An Effective Herbal Blend,"I have used herbal products for over 20 years. This is the gentlest, least expensive and most effective ""de-stressing"" natural product I have tried. Both my husband and I use it every day - taken at bedtime, it helps us both sleep better with no side effects. If taken during the day, it takes the edge of stress and anxiety without causing a heavy or drowsy feeling. There are similar blends available, but Ex-Stress seems to work best for us. At this, price, it's worth a try at the very least."
2,Ex- stress,I have not have not observed a noticeable change using this product. I have used some other products in the past that seemed to work better for me.
3,Battle of the Atlantic,"View this dvd from am educational POV how the U.S viewed the Atlantic war as it happened through propaganda. Don't expect any modern day recounts from Surviving veterans. If you're a WW2 buff, it's worth buying."
4,Effective and relevant,"Not my favorite J.G. Ballard work, but still quite good. The good is that it is exremely well written and well crafted. The bad is that I found the whole premise and story to be a bit obvious and predictable. Then again I am a freak, so maybe others will find it as shocking as it is intended to be.It is particularly relevant to American society today, given the current fashion for incessant coddling of children and shielding them from all manner of imagined horrors, whether by media bashing politicians or million moron mom marches.Read it and weep. We are already there."
2,Not a lot going on,"This book was severely, severely disappointing and shouldn't ever be compared to the excellent work of Chuck Palahniuk. The pretext of laying it out as if it were a police investigator's files, with simple titles for every single turn of events, just added to the feeling that there was no supporting plot here. The lead-in to the ""revelation"" of the bad guys is so long and contrived, and so unnecessary, you want to shake the characters and yell the answer in their faces. I have never written a bad ... review, but found this story so vacuous and void of character development, surprises, or even realistic murder scenarios, that I had to write."
1,nothing wild about it...,"this was the most boring book i have read in quite some time. i read it in a total of about three hours, constantly looking for some sort of twist or something other than the obvious. although presented as a mystery, crime-solving novel, you know exactly what's going to happen from reading the back cover. this book certainly shouldn't be compared to chuck palahniuk's amazing and thoughtful work. a complete dissapointment."
3,"slim book, slender idea","This was an interesting enough idea: rebellion from an obscenely contrived utopia. An editorial review described the story as being ""glib."" I agree. This story is very straightforward. No frills, no twists or turns. This book is mildly challenging or thought-provoking.I give this 3 stars because of my anxiety over slamming such a skinny book. Had this been a 200-paged book... I would have given it one star. But I can't expect too much from a book that's just 104 pages and doesn't waste too much of my time with a mildly interesting idea."
2,Nothing Great,"Quick. If you want a quick read for a rainy afternoon, this is it. Don't expect much. There are no surprises, there is little to look forward too. I've read much better shorts in Harper's and Atlantic Monthly. Anyone who thinks this book is ""shocking"" and ""chilling"" really hasn't read much. How this even got published _as a book_ surprises me still.Nonetheless, if it's a rainy day and there's nothing else to read....."
4,"Not perfect, but close","This product is far better than clip-on booklights, which illuminate only part of the page. This one fits ""standard"" hardcovers fine, but it's usable on other size books. It's plenty bright for my 50-year-old eyes, which don't work in dim light. In fact, if I wake up at 2 AM and need to read to fall back asleep, the ""bright"" setting is too bright, so I use ""dim."" Light is white (slightly blueish) not green as some have reported. Illumination is not perfectly uniform, but good enough. I've had it for 3 weeks, no scratches yet, but I notice that it works better if I clean off the dust every few pages. Turning the page and moving the lightwedge takes only a second, not a real problem. Overall, I highly recommend it!"
2,Scratch city,"I bought this book light after reading the postings on this site, which means I was twice as careful not to scratch the glass. Didn't help. When I switched pages, the paper itself actually left a two-inch scratch on the glass, which now mars every page I read. This is with the first read! I can't imagine what continuous readings will do. The lightbulb also casts a halo effect across the page, which I didn't mind as much as others. My suggestion is not to buy this product until they find a scratch-resistent glass. It really does effect the read."
2,Don't take plastic wrap cover off!,"This thing will be scratched to the point where you will be squinting and having trouble reading through the scratches after a week. No instructions come with it say to leave the plastic wrap on it. Also, as the battery fades the light dims imperceptibly and after months you may wonder what the *&%$ is going on. I won't be buying another of these."
3,LED Book Light,"I carried this in a book case and it got scratched up. It would be nice if it came with a case. It is the best book light I have used except for the scratching problem. Although you are supposed to be able to use it as a bookmark, I usually read more than one book at a time, so I don't use it that way. I would like a case so it wouldn't get scratched up so when I carry it with me all of the time, I can use it with whatever book I want to read. I carry more than one book at a time also."
2,Lightwedge,"Works OK lights up the page a little, but not greatDoesn't work well enought in the dark."
5,More than one use.,"Have had my LightWedge for a few years and find it incredibly useful for reading in bed without disturbing my husband. The light is bright & crisp and I almost never have to replace the batteries. However, I must pass along another great way to use the LightWedge I discovered after having my fourth child. When placed on top of my nightstand, it provided enough gentle ambient light for night wakings. I was able to nurse and change diapers all without fully waking my child or myself. It really makes a very handy nightlight as well."
2,Ok But I wouldn't buy another.,"This product lights the page very well but...It is uncomfortable to hold & inconvenient to move with each page. I have only had mine for a short time, only used it on a few occassions and it is already terribly scratched and even chipped despite my efforts to be careful with it. I have been using book lights for years and this is one of the worst I have ever owned. I will definitely go back to a rechargable clip-on."
3,not useful for bedtime reading,"My wife bought this for me so that I would be able to read at night without keeping the lights on. I read both magazines and fictional books, which are smaller in dimension. There are 2 problems with this product:1) It is NOT 1-size-fits-all. It was not easy to use this lightwedge with the smaller fictional books. So I would have to buy another $25 wedge for the smaller size.2) It also requires 4 AA batteries which make the black grid-end of the wedge heavier. This caused the lightwedge to keep slipping while trying to read lying down.On the other hand, if you're looking to just read on a plane or elsewhere sitting up, then this product is good. We, however, returned this and are looking for other alternatives."
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered the lightwedge not once but twice and each time due to the packaging not being stable enough, the wedge was scratched. I returned the item and even though I received the replacement, it too was scratched and was returned for credit. I did not request another lightwedge but rather requested a refund. I notified the company and they supposedly credited my account. HOWEVER I have spent months trying to receive the money back since they credited the wrong account (which I had closed due to my relocating out of the country). Even though the owner of the company promised to personally handle my refund after several failed attempts, I have still not recovered my money and it's been since July 2007. Today is November 29, 2007. Maybe you have more money to throw around than I do if your Lightwedge has any problems :) Good Luck!"
2,Not bright enough,The light isn't bright enough to read by. It is not usable. It was a thoughtful valentines gift and unfortunately it was a dud.
3,Should Have Gone with Tradition,"A little buyer's regret with this one. Put's out enough light to read by, but just barely. Couple that with the fact it is only a certain size and if you are dealing with a big book you must lay it on the page awkwardly and slide it around. It is made in the USA (a plus in my book). Another plus is it won't wake up your bed partner because it is very dim and only lights up the page you are reading. I'll keep it of course, but if it breaks I won't replace it and I'll buy my Dad something different like a Phorm model."
2,"Nice concept, poorly executed","I recently purchased this item. While the degree of illumination is adequate, the homogeneity of the lighting is poor, with some areas less well-illuminated than others. Another problem is that static electricity builds up, causing the pages to stick to the plexiglas in an annoying fashion. Finally, I consider the price rather high for this item, given its simple construction."
3,LightWedge Book Light,"I bought this version of the LightWedge Book Light and the smaller one for paperback books. Both lights perform very well, but both of them have small blemishes in the glass which interfer slightly when reading. A modest annoyance, but still an annoyance, especially considering that these lights cost $25 each. The smaller one is brighter than the large one and is adequate for reading both paperback books and larger, hard-cover books. I would buy the lights again, but probably only the smaller size, and I wish LightWedge would do a better quality control job on their product. I asked Amazon to replace both units which they did quickly and easily; however, both replacement units still had small blemishes. I decided to keep them anyway because except for that, the lights do a good job when I'm reading in bed"
2,A Tad Heavy Wedge,"Like some of the other folks reviewing the light wedge, I was initially excited about the product but immediately let down. The concept is great and the amount of light on the page is good. However, when I received the wedge it was loaded with dust and scratches (distracting to read through); furthermore, the dust on my wedge could not be wiped off (it was sandwiched in the plastic lens). A light wedge made slightly lighter, more comfortable to hold, and dust free would be great. All in all, I anticipated a higher quality product."
4,Lite Wedge Wonder,"This item really lights up the pages of any book or magazine. It is easy and convenient to use and you can use it as a bookmark too. It would be better if it magnified too, then I wouldn't need my reading glasses."
2,Not a good deal from Amazon,"I was very happy to find a Light Wedge at Amazon at a discounted price, but when it arrived the acrylic panel had numerous fine scratches on it and some larger deeper scratches as well. Scratches light up brightly when the wedge is illuminated, and are as annoying as trying to read through scratched eyeglasses. Clearly the product had been used or shopworn, although Amazon claimed it was 'new'. When I tried to return it, Amazon told me that they could not replace it with a new one because they were out of stock. So beware.When a light wedge is in good condition, it is a very pleasant book light, much less annoying than ordinary lights to others in a room or beside you on an airplane. They are a little heavy if you have to support the weight of your book while reading. And, the acrylic lens is easily scratched, so a protective case is probably a good idea for the times when your wedge is not stuffed in a book."
2,Lightwedge original,I was very disappointed in this. It arrived all scratched and the scratches are very anoying. The light is also very dim.
3,pretty good gel,This jel is not as smooth as Aveda's gel and it is about the same cost. Overall not bad but I am partial to shave creams since I normally use a brush.
4,what's in a name,"I came to this book via Kaplan's ""The Nothing that is"", and was advised to read B's book on numbers - until I found it was in French! The difference here is that there is no history of zero, which B calls the void, apparently because the development of the set theory which has the void as main key term is a name which doesn't present anything. It's a discourse without, from what I could see anyway, any social or historical implication. ""Nothing"" is what orders multiplication but its discovery doesn't do much for civilization, esp. given all the space and attention the authro gives to Badiou's belief in dodgy Marxism. Not sure I got the idea behind the political application of set theory, since if the truth procedures are absolute and a-social how does maths relate to politics? I looked at Think Again the other Badiou tome in a bookshop and thought it better to read this one more time. Somewhere between bananas and brilliant"
3,Skin-crawling experience,"Strongly felt the need to shower after viewing this debauchery. The conductor and orchestra are excellent. Beautifully played. Singers are okay. Stage director needs to be shunned, along with the ubiquitious Brian Large. A nasty piece of work, if there ever was. Keep it up Salzburg, and the 'Mohammad moment' at the opera's close will happen for real. Disgusting display. UGH!"
3,Disappointed,"One of my favorite Rat songs is Banana Republic, so I was very disappointed when I found it it was an edited version. To me, this is a sin, just drop another song and make them all album versions."
3,Misses some.,"This is not meant to be an overview of the band, but a list of deficiencies in this ""greatest hits"" collection. One: it is missing some very vital ""hits"" as well as seminal album tracks. I thought this would redress the glaring omissions on ""Great Songs of indifference"", but it only compounded them! Missing on both is the song that got me into the Boomtowns in the first place: ""Up All Night"". Also missing from this new collection is ""House on Fire"". ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE SONGS and one of their best! It says in the liner notes that this CD was compiled by an online poll. Well, they sure as heck never asked me or my friends. Also missing are great album tracks like ""Skin on Skin"", ""Whitehall 1212"", ""Little Piece of Red"", ""The Little Death"", ""Mood Mombo"" and ""Charmed Lives"". Come on, man. You call THIS a ""Greatest Hits""? ""Greatest Misses"" is more like it."
3,A Novel Approach to the Spanish Civil War,"Mosen Millan is a wonderful novel about a young man's tragic circumstances during the Spanish Civil War. Thought-provoking and very well written, it plainly and clearly discloses the horrors of this conflict in Europe's history. Not a beach novel, however! Be prepared to break out your Spanish dictionary when attempting to read this novel!"
3,Very good in some aspects but yet very bad in others,"First off, this book offers one of the most wide ranged practice tests available for the SAT. This extensive amount of practice allows for a user to sufficiently prepare for the SAT; however, what makes this book so bad is that most of the tests that are given are hold KAPLAN tests. If u have bought 2005 or 2006 SAT Books from KAPLAN ud find the exact same problems and tests. Although most of the tests are the ame, the overall review for english and math is by far one of the best out there next to Princeton Review and Barrons. I recommend this book if u have never purchased a KAPLAN SAT book before or just 1, but if you have purchased a recent SAT book by KAPLAN i would ABSOLUTELY not recommend this book unless you want some of the same practice tests"
3,This remastered version is slick but still weak,"This re-release of 'The War Machines' was restored by the Doctor Who Restoration Team. The story itself is not the greatest and William Hartnell's acting is sub-par. With that said, the remastered video has a clear and crisp picture. The preview segment is a nice addition, adding an additional preview of the War Machines. This story sees Ben and Polly join the Doctor. END"
3,Nice Predection Of Networking,"This episode of Doctor Who isn't that great. Basically, you have a super computer who has a bunch of killer robots (the ""War Machines"") and it wants to take over the earth. Blah, blah, blah.What made this episode interesting to me was the then almost unknown concept of networking computers. The idea for the super computer villian was that it had other computers that all linked to it and each other. The result made the super computer smarter. While that was laughable, today we do have corporate networks that span the globe and enable people to do more than ever.Bottom line, a mostly dull episode with an close prediction of the future of computing in the 1960's. That part makes it worth having (IMO)."
2,no help,nothing has changed my cat still something use litter box sometimes not. vet stated that ny cat was stree and her age..suffering frim anxiety stress whatever
1,Bad stuff don't buy ...,"I just got this and I and am just returning it immediately. I put it in the box and my cat peed on the sofa within the hour,GREAT. It says on the bottle do not use with practically anything but their own cat litter. Well it doesn't say that in the ad here. Back it goes, wow you really messed me up PRECIOUS CAT PEOPLE!!!!!!!!THX FOR NOTHING!I am the man in the house and after enduring your product creating our cats to decide to urinate anywhere they damn well pleased aside from their litter box where they were perfectly comfortable with no mishaps whatsoever. Your ""herb"" product is the very anthesis of what has been discovered to be your worthless failure of a sales pitch. Perhaps your research was done on dead cats for normal cats HATE this pathetic waste of money and time.I'm talking to my attorney about dealing with your company buying me a new couch as a result of your internet scam product"
1,Disappointing,This product worked for about 4 or 5 days; then she got used to it & went back to defecating on her spots on the floor!!! Very disappointing. Still looking for something to get her to use the box consistently.
1,It did not do a thing,IT ABSOLUTELY DID NOT WORK AT ALL. NONE OF MY 3 CATS SHOWED ANY INTETEST. I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED INDEAD.
3,"Helped the problem, but not a cure, for MY cat.","11 yr old cat that started peeing on the cat mat, every night. Did all the recommended attempts to get him to use another litter box & nothing helped. This lured him back into peeing inside the box about every other day. It's better than before, but had higher expectations from him. Hope to keep improving."
4,"so far, so good","I have a new cat, a rescue, and for the first few week he was great about the litter box. But then, while he still peed in the box, he started pooping on the rugs.What to do, what to do.Well, I went online to see what to try, and tried several ideas. He is a pretty big boy, so I got him a new larger box, actually a storage box. Changed to an unscented litter. Tried having two boxes, since I read some cat like to pee in one and poop in the other.No good.So, I tries the 'cat attract'. Sprinkled some on each box as directed.First night, no good.Second night, SUCCESS!And so it has continued, fingers crossed. A d he does use both boxes, the new big one to peed in and the smaller, old one to poop. No idea why, but if that is what it takes, so be it. It is not cheap, and hopefully once he gets the idea I will not need to keep adding it with new litter, but so far it seems to work for my Larry."
1,Really not sure,"I have used this product frequently, for my older cat. I really don't think it works, nor is it worth the $$$. I would not recommend this product."
1,Has had opposite of desired effect on my cat.,"Instead of being attracted to her litter box by this product, my cat has been repelled by it. Her box has stayed dry for over 24 hours at a time while she peed elsewhere. After I removed the product and freshened the litter, she used the litter box almost immediately."
1,precious cat ultra litter attractant,waste of money. my cat was repelled by it. also tried it on some friends cats who were also repeled by it.
2,much ado about nothing,my cat is immune to this. It didn't do a thing It's green and it did not faze my cat at all.
3,Bought for a problem. Didn't solve the problem.,"I bought this product to hopefully solve a problem with one cat not using the litter box. This didn't solve the problem. However, I purchased the litter that contains this product. My cats love it. The litter didn't solve the one problem child either. But they all love the litter."
5,Awesome product!!!!,"I adopted a kitten (l yr old) from a cat rescue. Another cat had peed in the house and Sophie began peeing there. After talking with my contact from cat rescue, she recommended Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attract. I couldn't believe how my Sophie took to peeing ONLY in her litter box. It is truly amazing how she immediately stopped urinating and is fixated on her box. She stands by it after she has ""gone"" so I can clean it out for her. She will just scratch in her box on occasion."
4,Trash to Treasure,Great book. Loaded with fun creative ways to recycle items everyone has at home. I love the snowmen made from soda cans. Cute!! You will enjoy this book.
3,Trash to Treasure Christmas,A very good craft book. Gives you lots of things to do with those thing you didn't no what to do with but didn't want to throw out.
2,Disappointing,"My child has another Fisher Price bath toy. This is poorly thought out. The ""boat"" does not stay stuck to the side of the tub/shower. It is nearly impossible to line up all the piece while being stuck to ""boat"" to have them activate each other with water. I got it on clearance for $5.99 and frankly it wasn't worth even that. Poorly thought out concept and not very fun."
2,I just don't get it.,"Pros: This item is sturdy and comes with a few parts that, by themselves, my daughter enjoys. She always loves the little people, and I like that she can use this person with her other toys.Cons: It is hard for her to push the toys onto the suction cup boat. It is almost impossible for her to line them up in a way that makes the waterwheel dump water into the dolphin that holds the person. . . .And even when it all goes right, it just isn't that cool.My biggest problem with the toy is that she tries to pull the suction cup boat off the wall of the tub or if I put it higher, off the shower wall. To her, that is the most amusing part. But, she throws off her balance doing this, and it is totally not worth the battle. I usually like little people toys. This one is just lame."
2,Not True to Size,"I really enjoy wearing ECCO shoes since I can wear them all day with great comfort. But when I ordered theECCO Performance Women's RXP 1060 Running Shoein my regular size, the shoe length was too short. As a result, my toes felt stuffed and they touched the end of the shoes. I was very disappointed because ECCO is one of my favorite shoe companies. Unfortunately, I was not given an option to exchange the shoes for a larger size. So, I had to return them."
1,Wimpy,"My old Craftsman 2-cycle trimmer gave up the ghost so I decided to go green with an electric. Once I got it going, the old Craftsman used to make short work of the weeds in my garden and behind my house.The string broke about 12 times on the Toro and I had to open up the spool to fish it out. And the garden was only about 1/4 done. I finally threw it down in disgust and gave up. It may be OK for trimming the grass around the edges of your yard, but that's about it."
1,Good idea...poor design,"I had my Toro 13"" model 51358 String trimmer less than a year. I bought it because it had what looked like the nice feature of turning the handle over and it became an edger. From the beginning, the advance-the-string by tapping it down never worked well. I would stop the trimmer, turn it over and tap the center with my hand and withdraw more string with the other hand. This worked for a while until the smooth metal grommet from where the string fed out from the housing disappeared. The string was now exposed to the sharp plastic edges of the string housing. Two feet of edging and no further before the string broke! After about 6 premature string breaks, the edger fell on the driveway (with a little help from me!!) and the handle broke off. The breaking of the handle was a good thing because the edger now fits very well in the recycle bin!"
2,bump feed did not work,"The bump feed did not work properly in the horizontal trim position, and did not work at all in the vertical (edging) position. I bought this trimmer to replace an older version which finally burned out after many years of service, so I know how they should work. With this one it was trim or edge for a foot or so, remove the head to feed out some more line, replace the head, and repeat- over and over again. Very frustrating. I even rewound the line on the spool a few times because it seemed to be trapped by overlapping line. I finally returned this trimmer. Overall, I have always liked the Toro brand, but this trimmer just didn't cut it (literally)."
1,Broke on 3rd Use,"Not only is this trimmer very weak, the string feeder is terrible. The plastic threading is not aligned, the string is either stuck or spools out because the cap holding it down will not tighten. Then the plastic eye the string is threaded through broke off altogether. I got 2 1/2 uses out of this flimsy product."
1,Greatly disappointed.,"I've been a loyal Toro - Electric Trim and Edger for many years. I've always been very satisfied with their products. However, I will never purchase this brand again. The line feeder did not feed properly. The line would roll back inside after less than 3 revolutions. The little eyelet that you string the line through the cap fell off. All this happened within 5-7 mins. of use. I should heed the negative reviews posted on this item. Please...reconsider your options!"
1,80s trimmer worked fine; 2 decades of TORO decay,"TORO's bump-feeding trimmers proved to be so AGGRAVATING that I promised myself that I would get on Amazon and write a SCATHEING review. I did not have this exact model, but I have 2 models -- the 12in and 15in, that were new last year. On both models, every 60sec the string broke (happens), but the string would get jammed in its own crevice of the screw mechanism, or would disappear back into itself. This required hand-untightening the string chamber. However, if hand-tightened, often one cannot untighten it 60sec later -- leave hardly tight. I don't own a gas trimmer, but I went online and spent $30 for replacement teeth for my friend's trimmer so that I will have access to his -- that bad. When I was a kid, I used a string trimmer and occasionally had to advance the string (2-3 times per yard). In 25 years, what has TORO done to FAIL SO MUCH on such a SIMPLE electric motor application?!"
5,serched and found,after buying two other trimmers that were self feed 'and and only gave frustration.this TORO bump feed works really great. had one years ago that had given many years of service. finally found this on the web...just the right size for a shorter person
1,Frustration,"I ordered an 8"" battery powered weed trimmer, but received a 13"" electric powered trimmer. Have tried to get this corrected, but with no luck. It seems to be impossible to speak to a live customer service person. If there are any, I don't know how to find them."
2,This is the least scientifically accurate Doctor Who episode,"The premise that Terminus is at the center of the universe goes against our knowledge of the astrophysics. Astronomers have agreed for more than one hundred years that there is no such thing as the ""center"" of the universe. The script of Terminus carries such a thorough misunderstanding of the big bang and the notion of the expanding universe, that it is almost objectionably wrong.Time travel, sonic screw drivers, regenerating time lords, daleks, cybermen---these are all theoretically possible within current scientific thought. However, saying that Terminus is at the center of the universe is like insisting that the earth is a flat square. It is just plain wrong and this, among other aspects of the script, takes this episode from the realm of science fiction to the realm of science misinformation."
3,"""You're a very brave person.""","""Terminus"" is a little dull, enjoyable, but dull. There's a nice creepy feeling when the crew of the TARDIS locks on to the Terminus ship. The Black Guardian/Turlough/""Kill the Doctor"" sub-plot is a little intrusive , as it deserves to be its own story. Turlough and Tegan are left crawling through airducts most of the story, while Sara Sutton shines, she has a great send off(and some pretty panties). The Garm isn't that bad, but he moves too slow. The Direction and acting is a little lazy at times, but overall, an enjoyable and interesting script. There is one real hilarious scene, The Black Guardian: ""Why have you not killed the Doctor?!"" Turlough: ""I haven't found him yet!"" The Black Guardian gives him a stiff jolt of pain. Great design, love the Viking names."
3,Nyssa says good bye,"The second of a three story arc, finds the Doctor and his crew trapped on board of ship of lepers. As if that weren't enough, one of his companions, Turlough, is working for the Black Guardian, who wants the Doctor destroyed. Sadly, this story starts out great, but quickly turns into a mish mash as more and more plot elements are thrown in as a means to justify a four episode length. In the end though, there is not enough meat to make this story worth the effort. There are some good moments. We see the relationship between Turlough and Tegan develop, one that will make them realize they need to trust each other in future stories. We also see the departure of compnaion Nyssa in a very sacrificial manner. Worth a look, but not really worth owning in ones collection unless you are a diehard fan."
5,Love These Boots!!!,"I just received my pair of black Grasshopper boots and I love them! So much, that I just ordered a pair in Brown. Now I am all set for Fall and Winter! I love the look and the comfort!Best purchase I've made in a long time. Don't hesitate to order...but hurry they're going fast!"
5,Sheer comfort!,"Love, love, love these boots! So incredibly comfortable - good fit - great with dress pants or jeans. Wish I had ordered multiple pairs when they were on sale!"
5,Shoes For Gramma,"I ordered these for my Gramma....she loves them. Comfort - excellent, Fit - excellent, Style - hey, she's a Gramma ! Delivered as promised. Will probably order again next year !"
1,disappointed!!!,"I bought this shoes because, of the good reviews. I wanted something light, comfortable, waterproof and keep my feet warm. It's comfortable and light but there is absolutely no protection for your feet. I was soooo disappointed, my feet was very, very cold and it felt like I have no shoes at all even though I was wearing very thick socks. I guess for what I paid for should not expected too much!"
1,Mine is going back,"After all the glowing reviews I thought I'd found the perfect convection toaster oven, but I am quite disappointed. It's huge, pretty much the same size as a microwave, so it's another big appliance to find counter room for. I supposed the ability to accomodate a 12"" pizza is a convenience, but really, how much pizza can and should one family eat?! The ""fan bake"" doesn't cook any faster than regular bake, and toasting bread takes forever and leaves it totally dried out. I'm returning mine and have ordered the refurbished Cuisinart 30BCFR toaster oven; we have this unit at work and I know I'll be getting what I want. Sorry, Toastmaster."
1,This is the worse toaster I've ever had,"I registered for this toaster and received it as a wedding gift but it is the worse toaster oven I've ever owned. When I'm toasting toast it starts steaming and then the steam fogs up the timmer window, which then cannot be read. Also, sometimes when it beeps to indicate that it's done the beep is distorted sounding like it has some programming issues. Also, multiple times the time in the display window has gone haywire while I was cooking and the time would display strange and unreadalbe. Then, when I'd try to press stop to stop it from cooking or toasting it will not stop which then causes me to have to pull the plug to get the thing to shut off which causes electrical sparks. I'd love to just toss this toaster in the garbage but I feel bad because it was a wedding gift that I picked out. I would definately shop around and pick a more reliable brand next time. I just hope that the manufacturer will let me return this malfunctioning toaster."
2,Thank goodness for reviews,"Have been a user of toaster ovens for over 40 yrs. I, too, have experienced problems with Toastmaster ovens. I've switched to Black & Decker....My present B/D has given me faithful service for over 15 yrs.without a single problem. ..but, it's time for a newer model. I just got back with a new Black/Decker.... I looked at the toastmaster...and am sure glad I didn't get one...after reading the reviews in this site. Thanks... I appreciate the frank & honest comments. Wow!"
4,I love it,"Bought my oven to keep the kitchen cool. It does everything as described. Fast cooking, makes great cornbread, pizza, and chicken.Its great for fast meal preparation"
4,Good oven,"I use my oven for broiling and roasting meat. It does a good job. The timer is accurate. I can set it according to the recipe and forget it until it beeps when roasting. The only timer setting for broiling is one hour, and my meat is always done before that."
1,a hazard,"We got this toaster oven in March as a present. I had been using it for about 4 months and it was working great until one day when the glass door decided to shatter. I thought perhaps this was a fluke or ours was defective, until my father in law checked the internet and found that this was a rather frequent occurence with toastmaster toaster ovens, we also found that they tend to catch on fire. We called toastmaster and all they would do is send us another one, would you want another exploding toaster oven. This product should be taken off the market."
5,Best Toaster-Oven,This is the best toaster-oven I have owned in over 40 years!The pizza baking feature is great! I'm buying a a second unit for my vacation home to replace the old one although it still works.
5,Little workhorse continued 4,"Too, Salton owns Toastmaster and this was a positive when I bought the oven. I have a few Salton products and dealing with them has been a extremely positive experince.There is only 3cons to this machine.1. It does not have a warming button2. I am not a fan of the timer button. It is automatically set at 1 hour. So if you are making a batch of cookies for 10 minutes you have to push back from 60 minutes down to 10. It is not fast by any means either. I think it would be better engineered if they let the timer button start at 0 instead of 60 minutes.3. The oven does get hot on the outside. This is not just synomous with Toastmaster brand convection oven but with many of the other brands as well. So when using take precautions with children and yourselves. Definatly don't let a child be around to operate it without adult supervision.Overall, I feel this an extremely well made product that has really served my family well. It does everything it"
5,Joyful!,"The word for this book is JOYFUL! The pictures practically leap off the page in their enthusiasm. The text is a poem all about praising God, inspired by Psalms 148 and 150. Animals, people, and all other things of nature are described as joyfully praising their Creator. It's a book that can reach many ages -- young children with its bright pictures and animal sounds, older children and adults with the poem's more sophisticated, lyrical words, which are full of love and gratitude toward God. What if we all just dropped what we're doing, joined hands, and danced in celebration of the wonderful gifts around us? This book lets you imagine it!"
1,"Sorry, can't even get it started!","I had high hopes for this since my four-year-old daughter enjoys other such 'talking books' as Dr. Seuss' ABC and Green Eggs and Ham, and I remembered Mike Mulligan from when I was a kid.But the disk won't even intall on my XP machine. Click on 'setup' and.....NOTHING.....happens. I'm going to have to send it back."
1,"D-Bat Pro Stock Ash 32""","Do NOT Waste your time or money!!!!!Ordered a two toned dipped bat, received it on a Monday,used it for a total of 8 to 10 hits on Thursday and the bat cracked all along the grain. First high school game of the season.What a disgrace and embarassment as we had been hyping up the brand. The company(d-bat) said it was not a manufacture defect although I have picture proof that the crack ran along the wood grains.Was told that there is a weak spot on the front and back of the bat where the bat logo was stamped. They DO NOT give you much of a break towards a new bat, only $4.99 off regular price. They also Do not bother giving you a credit for the postage you spent sending the Broken bat back. Management(John V.) was supposed to call me to discuss my dissatisfaction but never did. Bad Customer service from the top. Bad Product."
1,Cheating customer,when i recieved my cable i saw that the packaging of the product is new but the cable itself isn't brand NEW. i found this out by seeing that there were alot of scratches on the connector/adapter. i will not order this kind of merchandise again.
5,remix like it should,faust exists for 30 years now and still they are capable of making innovative music. celebrating their birthday artists like kreidler and the residents did a brilliant job in recreating their music. the results are sometimes astonishing and always more than interesting.an absolute must for everyone who thinks that there is hope for new music
4,Captivating and Thrilling!,This movie was wonderful! I watched it several times during the weekend. Duncan Regehr is a great Zorro and the supporting actors play their parts well. Watch it. You'll love it!
3,"The concepts aren't very real-life, but Regehr does well.","The story was a bit off the wall and hard to believe, but otherwise a nice addition to a Duncan Regehr or Zorro Fan's collection."
4,Adventure without the hype. Great family fare.,"An enjoyable pic; This video is well worth a view. High adventure with a low budget, this show displays some of my favorite actors. Perfect for all ages. A great addition to any Zorro fan's collection."
1,Edited Version,"This version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the DVD and listed in the IMDb. I saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again, but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie. The DVD packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by Amazon. They made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done. I do not recommend this version to anyone. The orginal movie deserves better than this chop job."
2,Not so thrilling,"Jamie Lee Curtis looked great stretched across the bed. Her Lover looked appreciative, but the sight of the microphone at the top of the screen destroyed the illusion and any positive impression of the scene. Such lack of care left the entire production lifeless. IMDb lists this movie as a thriller, perhaps because it contains no adventure, action, romance, etc. Waiting for the ""thriller"" payoff was futile. Without a buildup to the central relationship of the movie, one is left wondering why it occurred. Although the primary difficulty in the relationship is anticipated at length, the encounter that resulted was lacking in tension and passed much too quickly.If you are not a Jamie Lee Curtis fan you may not want to watch this"
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"A poor quality re-release of the Roger Corman B-movie, ""Love Letters"". Either this version has been extensively edited or the legendary nude scenes have been vastly overrated. Not particularly interesting or erotic. The only good thing I can say is: I'm glad I bought the used VHS, rather than the expensive DVD."
3,"Nice speakers, output not so great","I like these speakers because I was looking for bluetooth speakers to make my life more wireless, but the pros and cons will be detailed as shownpros:1)wireless speakers are cool, bluetooth worked well without breaks2)remote thingi is niftycons:1) audio cracks way too much when volume is turned up high2) nice to listen to music if you are home in a room by yourself, nearly useless outside as a form of speakersI recommend all in 1 units, my friend bought one of those with an mp3 player built in with the speakers and a rechargable battery, it blew this unit away."
4,Fantastic for the price!,"I paid around $34.00 for these bluetooth speakers, and it was a great deal! The sound is very good, it is very light, bluetooth works great, no difficult at all to set it up with my Smartphone. The batteries do not last long (as with all bluetooth devices I have), but rechargeable batteries should do the work well. I really recommend it."
2,Very weak speaker,"I have other Altec Lansing speakers in this product class. I use this at my desk at work, but it's not good for much else. The sound is even too weak for use on the deck while grilling. The included B.T. headset adaptor works OK, but is not great. I wouldn't pay over $25 for this"
5,Sweet Little Gadget,"I was looking for both a desktop speaker and headset (for working out and general entertainment) for my Blackjack II music. After hours of headset comparisons I decided on one and then went on to find a desktop speaker and stumbled upon this Altec Lansing desktop/travel speaker with a detachable headset. There is a little door in between the speakers which holds a small unit into which you plug wired, very comfortable earphones (and I have small ears). The pairing is very easy and the sound is pretty impressive especially considering the size of the shiny black speaker unit. Right now I am listening to XM radio through the headphones and it sounds amazing. I am extremely impressed and I am very critical. By the way I did not order the other headset cause this does it all!!! Oh and it comes with this nice case which holds the speaker and earphones. The price on the box was $99. . .I got it for $34 plus shipping but it would have definately been worth the $99 as well!! :)"
3,Distorted sound sometimes a problem,"I like everything about it except the speakers distort horribly if you turn the volume up. I read reviews that indicated distortion at high volume, and I would expect distortion because of the speaker's small size, but these speakers seem to do it excessively. Sometimes the volume level needed to eliminate distortion is not adequate enough to be heard clearly. I only recommend these speakers because I'm not sure better ones are on the market, considering the few options available for people in the market for bluetooth speakers."
5,LOve Lancome,"I purchased the Lancome Artliner because I was looking for a black eyeliner, and someone recommended it on Amazon. I love it! It is a liquid liner. I have never had luck with liquid liners. They smudge, smear, and I make a big mess. With Lancome Artliner, I do not make a mess. I love it, and I recommend it."
5,Excellent!!,"I just recently caught the first season of this show on BBC America, and I cannot wait to own it!! Such a great, believable story, with great character actors, this has easily become one of my favorite shows..."
5,taken by suprise,I totally got pulled into this show from episode one and couldn't stop watching it. The characters are in a desperate situation but still carry on as people. Like family. Its like Battlestar Galactica on the ground. This show is a total hit in my family and would be an even bigger hit if they would finish the series and not just leave us devoted fans blowing in the wind wondering what happens now. Even if its just one more season to tie up all the loose ends...this show was getting it right they gotta do more. Seems like all they put out is zombie this and zombie that... well I say put out something real and meaningful which is what this show is... now finish it already please!!!!!!!! I need my show!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Very staid...,"one commentator here said there was no supernatural stuff or gore --- which is what I look for in a movie --- but that's me and it doesn't matter what others think --- I like sci-fi and don't really enjoy character interactions in a future society/world unless there are special effects and other enhancements to enjoy --- this reminds me a little of Lost where you basically need to get in to understanding the characters and their personalities and interactions. That is not for me --- but again, de gustibus non es disputandem --- (in matters of taste there is no dispute)"
5,wonderful series - looking forward to owning it,"We've just discovered this series on television and are thrilled there's more to enjoy.The characters are believable, and the interaction interesting. Good writing and plot. There's action to fulfill the needs of the guys in my house and I'm fascinated by the concept of how society would behave in the event of such an apocalyptic disease. Apparently it's a re-imagining of a series from the 1970's.Two seasons have been filmed (as this DVD set shows) and I really hope they carry on into a third season - We'll watch!"
4,survivors,"The acting is very good.So is the plot, but it does wander at times. People who took food and water from stores never thought to take guns and bullets for their protection. They were harassed by men with guns. Again and again. Always saying, don't want to become like them. It is a wonder they lived so long. It is worth the money, but be aware there is no proper ending."
3,Could have been better,"While I did enjoy the show and drama, it is television after all.The series had a virus of it's own.Political Correctness. Like or not this kind thing ruins a story and makes the characters nothing more then caricatures of what would otherwise be an interesting story. Although there were many I'll point out a couple of problems created by injecting PCness into the show. The men are portrayed in a very unrealistic manner. Tom the gangster seems to have been lifted whole cloth from a British gangster film and is the only one willing to fight to survive. Dexter holds power using one shotgun, ONE!!! Umh, no one sees a problem with this? And the religious man turns out to be nutcase!Bottom line is that whenever you inject politics into storyline in such ham fisted manner it ruins it. PERIOD."
4,Good Movie,I watch a lot of Polish movies and this is one of my favorites. Linda does a really good acting job and the little girl is just wonderful.
3,Basic Jarmusch,"Visually beautiful, but otherwise a little hollow movie. Maybe Jarmusch did a film too Jarmusch-like, allthough I still like the way Jarmusch paints a picture about post-modern alienation. And when it comes to the casting of this film, Bankol√© is just made for the role of a mysterious loner (and most of the side characters do a brilliant job too). Anyway, this film is definitely worth seeing."
4,Not a critic but....,"This movie is such that as it goes along, I wondered ""what's next"" and was not disappointed. Definitely not a waste of time and I thank the cast and crew for the presentation."
1,Terrible,"This film was like watching a really really bad French new wave film. So basically boring, meandering, pretentious, and utterly hollow. And about 50 years too late. Its just for those fans of Jarmusch who still dote on Coffee and Cigarettes."
1,Long wait for NOTHING to happened just some T&A,"Can we give this -1 stars. I read three of the positive reviews and two negative ones and all I felt was that they were funny. They said things like ""I did not understand (anything) about what was happening but the author must have had some GREAT IMAGE he was trying to convey."" Give me a break! You wait for about 2 hours for something, anything to happen, only it never does. The only highlight was the young woman with the great XXXXX. However, do not rent this video even for that purpose. There were only 3 short scenes and 2 profiles with her. This was the dullest video I have watched in a LONG TIME. It was not BAD, but that was because it never did anything except wasting film."
4,Value & performance/1 less star for service,"More than good value for money. Well made unit with all you could need to start using a PDA including cradle support software and easy access to development tools. However, I feel slightly cornered into being restricted to the MS platform. It would be great if they opened the architecture of the device to ease developers and users wanting to utilize Linux etc. Also their support is slightly lacking. I bought my unit a couple months ago and it was supplied with win 2002, yet 2003 has been out considerably longer than a couple of months. One would assume that to keep customer loyalty a free up-grade would be offered."
5,Automotive Replacement Belts,These belts are Automotive Industry Standard Belts - Designed to fit your car and last. These belts are not chinese made and many stores are not offering these quality belts. Always look for quality Gates Belts as a reliable replacement part.
3,Be wary of this product,This is the same item as the now discontinued Lectrix 0101 Intelliblend mixer. If you want to get an idea of the production quality of this product please see the reviews there. Make sure that Westinghouse will support this product by providing replacement parts for the freezing blades.
2,GREAT!!............when it works,i bought this blender because i thought it was a pretty cool concept to have recipes at your fingertips while mixing drinks or what have you. i loved how my smoothies came out with this thing. but i have used it less than 10 times and it isn't working at all anymore! the blades froze. the recipe screen still works but what good is that when the blender doesn't work?! don't buy this. i paid about $50 for it and it has turned out to be an absolute waste of money. very disappointing. i guess i'm going to have to search for replacement parts as i can't return it and it's practically brand new.
2,I DON'T RECOMMEND,Worked great while it was working. Received it as a gift and loved it for the 5-10 times I could use it. Now frozen blades and can't find replacement parts as of yet.
1,LOOKS ARE DECEIVING,"The blades on our blender froze after 3 wks of use. I cant find replacement parts. Although it looks hi-tech w/ an lcd w/ recipes, its a piece of junk w/o a rotating blade to actually blend with. Do not buy this!!"
1,Don't buy,"I got this blender as a wedding gift and thought it was great. The first time I used it, the motor died. So, I called the company and they replaced it. I had the 2nd one for about 6 months (used it rarely) and the motor died.It's great cause it has all of those recipes on there but if you're blending something thicker than oil & flour, the motor dies. I do not recommend purchasing this product."
5,Clergy Sexual Abuse - How Does It Happen?,"As a victim of clergy sexual abuse, I found this book to beveryencouraging to read stories of other women who have experienced thesame thing I have, but yet so sad that this happens much more oftenthan we realize in churches. Because many churches do not accept the truth of clergy sexual abuse, this book is a good resource to help others understand about the misuse of power. The six stories, told in first person, tell of women who loved God and wanted to serve him, but yet were sexually exploited through their vulnerabilities by trusted clergy who misused their power. The preface by Marie Fortune is excellent. She has written so much truth in a few pages, as only she can because of her experience and her desire to keep telling the truth of this devastating abuse. This would be an excellent book for anyone desiring to understand how clergy sexual abuse happens. END"
3,"Screaming Jets,Hot or not?","I'll give this a 33/4 stars as the song ""C'mon"" was my reason for buyin' it. HIGH ENERGY METAL pretty well describes it. The rest of the CD is good but doesn't have the ferocity and hard-drivin' style of C'mon"". Yet, I will be checkin' out some of their other compilations later on. Still, definitely worth lookin' into further! Yepper!"
1,Much better maps out there,"First of all, Provence is broken into 2 maps in the Michelin map system. That was kind of annoying. But what really annoyed me was how hard they were to use as you had to fold various ways to make any sense of them. We ditched these maps and relied on GPS and other maps we picked up in France. You can do better, IMHO."
3,Wrong book--Wake up Amazon.com!!!!,"I appreciate photographer Anthony Suau's work, but this book BRAZIL INCARNATE is not by Anthony Suau even though Amazon's website says that it is. The book is by a photographer who's last name is Pillitz. I ordered this book, waiting for a book by Anthony Suau, the author according to Amazon.com of the book BRAZIL INCARNATE. I wish Amazon.com hadn't decieved me and sent me a book that is not by Anthony Suau. Shame on Amazon.com. Did they lie on purpose? I don't think so... It's general incompetance, that's all. Now, I am stuck with a book I didn't order. Thanks for nothing you bastards!"
5,A great addition to our collection,"My kids fell in love with this upbeat collection of songs. We are real Raffi fans, and this latest CD has quickly become a favorite. Even my 2 year old can't get enough of the catchy tunes. Mom's favorite is ""Yellow Submarine"". The best thing about Raffi is that it's kids' music that anyone can enjoy. The songs are meaningful yet fun. Thanks, Raffi!"
1,Still boring,"Sorry, listening to the clips from this album left me and my 2 toddlers cold. I still don't understand what all the hoopla is about. I am unimpressed with this performer's voice. The lyrics might impress some but the actual performance is nothing special. Laurie Berkner could breathe life into these songs."
5,Great CD,"I almost didn't buy this CD because of the bad reviews, but I am glad I did, because my whole family loves it! We have several Raffi CD's & this is the only one my 5 year old requests. It is my favorite Raffi CD. ALL the tunes are very enjoyable. A MUST for your Raffie collection!"
1,We miss the OLD Raffi!,"A Raffi enthusiast since my own early years, I was thrilled to see Raffi had a new CD out and waited expectantly for it's arrival. My family was so disappointed by the lack of the fun traditional and original songs Raffi usually includes in his albums. Instead we ended up with a collection of heavy-handed political and environmental songs with lyrics like (no kidding) ""In the early years of life / what does a newborn need to be / whole, to thrive in every way? / In these crucial early years, when the brain is growing, and / the love for a lifetime takes hold / Not just the parents' love, not just love of the family / It takes all of this and more"". (from the song ""It Takes a Village""). Does this sound like a children's song? There really aren't any catchy, silly songs here -- what Raffi does best. Instead are tribute songs to Jane Goodall and the Dalai Lama. The sad truth is, this album just isn't any fun. We'll keep our other Raffi albums and sell this one back."
4,This is a Golden Oldie,"Cary Grant as a youngster in this movie, but you can still see the body and facial moves that made him a Star! Who ever said Claude Rains was a short dumpy guy and would never make it as a ""ladies man""; needs to take another look. Not only is he good looking, but he acted circles around the younger Grant."
3,Expected more color plates,"There were 21 color plates. Some of the color plates were not very large. It was my fault for not checking more, before I purchased the book. Lots of history to read, but I was more interested in seeing the paintings of George Inness. Many black and white photos, which are helpful, in seeing values in paintings. Perhaps by the time I read all of the book, I will be much happier with my purchase."
3,photos are NOT color and very small,"Disappointed with photos throughout, very small black and white.Writing more about science than the art of the artist.After-all, color was george inness key in art."
3,This movie is a great piece that captures the essence of Don,"This movie is one of the all time great ones for side-splitting psychosis. Don Knotts is truly a master of the reaction faction. The premise is a slice of early 60's simplicity. It serves as a time capsule of a more innocent view without the gritty ""underbelly"" that seems so popular of late."
5,So handy!,"I can't tell you how often I have reached for this littlejewel. Often enough that I am on my third edition. Puzzle workerswill love it. Letter writers need it. I rely on it. It has saved my ego many times. Just the right size for school or work, this speller/divider should be on everyones list of essential reference books."
5,Understand a new perspective on our world,"Everyone who thinks they have an opinion on either side of the ""globalization"" fence should read this well organized, and researched book. It is incredibly comprehensive, yet each topic is subdivided into very digestible pieces. And each of these in turn are well supported with detailed research and footnotes. It sets a high bar for those on the bandwagon of anti-globalization with a positive and fresh perspective on the reality of global development."
5,Marber Strikes Again!,"This book follows on Peter Marber's earlier book on emerging markets to tell the story of the future before it happens. Mixing astute analysis of data with a world view that has been proven to be correct, Mr. Marber shows the way to the future. I tend to be bearish about the markets but Mr. Marber's argument is very compelling and enlightening. This book is a must read for investors and students alike."
2,Just common sense stuff smart people already knew...,"I almost want to say it was a waste of my time, because I knew all that. No professor had to tell me any of this. Being from middle class, I know that money affects every aspect of my life.Only the rich and spoiled will learn from this book, as they have no idea that life can be less than perfect."
5,Must see,"This movie is so inspirational. For anyone who is thinking about giving up on their dream, or for anyone who needs motivation to find their dream, watch this movie! It truly is a beautiful, life-changing story."
5,Enriched my life,"This book emboldened me to choose my own healing solution, even while my doctor disapproved, and my body thanked me. Andrew's many personal stories give credence to this highly specialized book and make for easy reading. I am 76 and will not be doing a triathlon, but my health will be better because of this book."
4,waited too long,"I should have purchased this a long time ago.Very informative book, every american should own one...."
3,Great Book/Real Small,"This is a great book, but beware that it is very small. I have seen cell phones bigger than this book!"
1,Better Books Available!,"I have purchased many books on the U.S. Constitution. This book was okay, but compared to others it only deserves one star. My two favorite books which I would give five stars are The U.S. Constitution for Everyone, and The U.S. Constitution & Fascinating Facts About It. Read the reviews for those books and you'll see that many people share my opinion."
1,Disappointing,"The book does not go far enough to make it useful to most readers. It would have been easy to provide additional information on the Constitution, the signers, etc..., but instead the author(s) took the easy route and simply reprinted the document! Very weak book. Not work the money!"
5,Unusual usage,"I actually use this to cover the arm of my power wheelchair to protect it from rain, dust, wind, spills, etc. The w/c mfg cover was far more expensive. The hand part fits over the switches, the thumb over the joy stick and the wrist cover fits over arm of chair providing secure protection. Love it and have received many compliments on the alternative use at reasonable cost."
1,Don't buy if you are having hand surgery.,I had reconstructive surgery on my hand. The gasket that goes over your cast to seal the protector is much too tight to get on if you cannot move or apply pressure to your fingers.
3,"Bulky & uncomfortable, but does the job.","I have to be in a cast for five weeks and ordered this to use for showering. It does the job, but is not comfortable. I later tried the ""sport"" type and liked it much better.The large, rigid ring at the top of this cover makes it quite unwieldy and awkward. Also, I don't think it's made for average or larger adults. I'm a size 16 lady and the rubber seal at the top was unbearably tight at the top of my arm. It completely cut off my circulation and was extremely painful. I remedied this by enlarging the opening with scissors, which made it somewhat bearable.The sport style is much more comfortable though.PRO: sturdy, keeps cast dry, seems like it would lastCON: too tight, awkward, unwieldy"
3,"Keeps Cast Dry, Hard to Use","This keeps casts very dry but its very difficult to use without help. I had a fractured wrist and it took 3 weeks of recovery before I was able to put it on by myself without pain. The rubber seal keeps water out, but also puts stress on your forearm/wrist as you put it on and take it off."
3,Disappointed,"I had never seen a device like this but the reviews were mostly positive so I thought I'd give it a try. Although the description says the diaphragm pulls on easily and application is simple and one-handed, I was unable to pull the device over my bandaged hand/lower arm. The hole in the diaphragm is very, very small and is difficult to stretch - I am a petite woman so it's not that I have abnormally large arms or anything.This probably works just fine for someone with a hard bandage/cast that they can be rougher with, but I'll be returning it; I guess I'm back to plastic and tape until I can find a more suitable product."
1,Opening too small,The opening in the rubber seal in the plastic seal ring is too small to accomodate an adult's cast. I couldn't get my hand and cast into the waterproof cover. Maybe the device would work for smaller hands. My hand and cast aren't unusually big.
1,Difficult to use without assistance,"I purchased this for my husband after he had surgery and was unable to get his arm wet for a month. I was thinking this would be easier and more effective than the old trashbag. I was dissapointed, if I wasnt there to help him there is NO WAY he would ever be able to put this on by himself. I can imagine most people would not be able to do so, since most probably only have full use of one arm anyway if they need this. It is also pretty tricky to take off, his arm was sore and sensitive still and the rubber opening would snap back if you didnt hold it very tight. It was difficult for me to get my fingers in there to pull it back and remove it off his arm. Save the money and use a trashbag (kitchen size works best) and some tape around the end."
4,So Helpful!,"The Seal-Tight protector was so helpful during my recovery from a broken finger. It's much better than taping a plastic bag around my hand. Although my only issue was that it was a little tough to get on and off my hand without disrupting the bandage that was holding my splint on. The opening to the protector is a thick rubber with a small hole, making it difficult to insert my hand without grabbing the bandage. It would be very helpful if the product came with a way of opening the hole wider to get your hand in and then closing tightly to secure the seal. Again this is a minor inconvenience but it keeps me from giving it five stars."
5,Keeps the water out.,"If you've ever tried to keep the water out while taking a shower with a hand, arm, or foot bandaged you know how difficult that can be. A full roll of saran wrap and duct tape won't do the job, but these ""Seal-Tight"" protectors will. Relatively quick and easy to put on and take off. Simply said, they work!"
4,Just what I needed,After a bear broke into my truck camper shell I needed to fix the lock and this was the exact part I needed; good quality and prompt delivery. I had to form it slightly to accommodate the bed liner on tailgate. Seemed a little over priced is the only 'con' I have.
4,Great for younger children,This is a good way to teach toddlers and pre-schoolers the basic spanish words..
2,Not Doctor Who at its best,"Being one of the handful of Hartnell episodes available today, this is worth buying, but it's definitely not Who at its best. Slow and very bad costumes/effect (yes, even for Who)."
2,"Out of time, out of date","One of the great things about Doctor Who is that despite its age, especially in regards to the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras, the stories stand the test of time. Unfortunately, The Web Planet is one of those few exceptions. The alien insect creatures are laughable. The story is ploddingly drawn out. The regular cast members are given no opportunities to shine. A soundtrack would have helped somewhat to move this along. There are dramatic moments that are left for dead because of the lack of musical background. The Web Planet is one of those stories that is solely for the avid Doctor Who fan. For the casual viewer or for the person who is trying to relive a childhood memeory, stear clear of this one. It'll ruin the memory."
5,Jerry I Miss You,"This is a wonderful *CLASSIC* Jerry Garcia Album. Having lived in the Haight I got to see Jerry and the boys for free many-a-times and miss the mellow crowd and the great atmosphere. And oh my, this album has Jerry Playing and singing at his best!"
3,Major Problems in Mexican American History,Book is in condition seller described: worn but still in good condition. :-) Thanks!-
3,It's okay...,I used this once but really didn't like it much. It didn't feel like it did much of anything. I was willing to give it another shot because the price wasn't bad but I just haven't gotten around to ordering it again.
2,poor display,"The LCD display is dim and its resolution is so low. There is a blank horizontal line across the entire scree, making it difficult to read the text. They should use a much better display."
2,"Necessary, but too small","Something like this is necessary as the lightwedge scratches so easily. However, mine was made too small and the zipper ended up breaking after a few uses."
5,Great case for the reading light.,Purchased this case to go with the reading light.Perfect fit. I use the case when the light is not in use so the light doesn't get damaged.Bought one as a gift and one for myself.Great price and quick delivery.
3,Perfect fit but not enough protection,"I ordered this bag to protect my light wedge from scratching. Unfortunately, I still wound up with several scratches even though I was extremely careful with my Lightwedge. The bag fit perfectly but just didn't offer enough protection. I would still order it if you are going to order the Lightwedge though. I'm sure it does help, just not enough for what I wanted."
3,NOT A SNAKE MOVIE,"With the name like ""Venom"" you would expect a big ole improbable snake. Nope. This is a slasher film. Ray (Rick Cramer) while performing an act of kindness, gets killed and bitten by snakes. These aren't just any snakes, but snakes who have evil souls within them. The souls are transferred through the venom to the dead Ray, who doesn't stay dead. It is up to the teens to save the day.Other than the manner in which the slasher is created, this film offers nothing really new to the genre. No clever dialouge, no memorable characters, no special killing scenes, no shower scenes. It's Louisiana, voodoo, kids and a slasher. Nice cemetery. I obtained mine on a Wal Mart 20 pack. $5.00 for all 20 films.Parental Guide: f-bombs. No sex, no nudity. Girl showing off her stolen leather bra, ""a crook with a nice rack."""
4,"Rigoletto, Verdi","Over all, it's a good version of the famous Verdi's tittle. Among the cast, it shines with his own bright light the argentine tenor Marcelo √Ålvarez, who gives a real singing lesson in ""Farmi veder le lacrime"". Inva Mulla, as Gilda, offers a traditional version both in the vocal as in the scenic aspects. Regarding humpbacked √Ålvarez, he shows us that Rigoletto is a role still to big for him, specially if we keep in mind the Cornell Mc Neil version. L√≥pez Cobos reads with pulchritude the sublime verdinian score and I think he should highlight some dramatic parts and have more theatrical sense. The staging is simply correct. The DVD's technical aspects are excellent."
4,Hunter Baseball fan--we love it!!,"This fan was installed in our 6 year old son's room--and it is really cute. It took both my husband & I to install it, only because he needed me to hold it up while he connected it. Other than that, it was very easy and fit where his old fan had been. The glove looks almost like leather--two family members even reached up to touch it because it looks like it would be soft. The baseball globe is adorable--it even has red stitching! The motor is very quiet, and it doesn't wobble at all. A definite thumbs up!"
2,Not for use with vaulted ceilings,"It's a cute fan, but hard to install on vaulted ceilings since the rod on the hanger ball is not very long. Usually you can buy an extender, but the connection on this rod is different than any extender we can find. The two stars should be taken with consideration that we never saw it work."
3,HP printer,"I like HP printers better than others I have had. It doesn't always work as well as the last HP printer I had. It seems to jam more easily, especially with envelops."
2,60 minutes is not is 12mins,dont buy this items is not 60 mins at all is only 12 mins long i paid $20 total for nothing thats the last time i will buy any dvd called 60 minsfrom amanzon
3,queasy,I like the fact that they are chewable. The flavor is a bit nauseating though and chalky. Chalky is to be expected but the icky taste caught me off guard. Bone health is more important that taste so I will take them but I 'll buy a different brand next time
5,Easy to eat,"I tried these chewables at my cousin's and bought some for myself. They taste good and are easy to remember to take because it is like having a piece of candy,"
4,A LEGEND!!!!,tak is a legend in his field and knows alot about japanese martial arts any of his stuff at the right price is a must have for your japanese martial arts collection.
5,Returning to the Natural State,"The author takes the Eightfold Path of Buddhism. It is discussed itme by item, in sufficient detail to show how the sense of self that goes with one's individual personality can be shed.The idea is to continue to act completely natural and to do all those things expected of a human being in one's particular status, position, etc. just as clover grows and behaves exactly as it should in its perticular sstatus and position.Clover has no mind or the functions associataed with the mind; the human being then acts just aa normally as the clover with the additional feature of a mind, but without any more cognitive identity of self than the clover."
4,Great Ending To A Wonderful Series,"Megan's Mate was a great ending to the Calhoun series. It was fun to see how everyone in the first books were doing (C.C., Trent, Amanda, Sloan, Lilah, Max, Suzanne, Holt, and you can't leave out the kids, CoCo and Colleen!). Megan and Nate were perfect for each other and enjoyable to read about. I also was glad to see that CoCo finally found her someone to love (it was about time, after all she was the matchmaker for all the girls!). If you haven't read the first four books, read them before reading this book, it will make it a lot more enjoyable."
2,Bad description,"They claimed that the book was in ""very good condition."" If ""very good condition"" means heavy spine wear and cracking which needs to be repaired and could never be sold as ""used"" by library standards plus some writing and cover damaged then I have an IMMACULATE book. Don't buy from them."
4,a family re-visited,i loved this book most out of the series. the relationship between and aunt and the cook was terrific! ::smile
4,I actually liked it.,"I actually liked this book even though by looking at the cover I would have thought this book was going to suck. but amazingly it didn't. I'm surprised. normally I wouldn't read what I call a "" b book"" I gave it a try because I like nora roberts books. And alot of her ""b books"" are pretty good."
2,Pretty but imperfect!,"I bought this shower curtain on sale at another store and hung it in my cabana. I love the subtle pallette and it looks great but it is too long! I had to raise the rod to accomodate it and then realized that the vinyl liner is now too short so now the shower curtain gets all wet and water is all over the floor. I have not had a problem with mildew yet as the other reviewer maybe because the shower is not used as often. I did look around for a longer liner and discovered that this curtain is 75 inches long but standard liners are 72 or 78 inches long. I don't want to shorten this curtain and lose the pattern so I'll have to cut down a new 78"" liner."
1,"Wrong size lamps recieved, problem with return.","Purchse of this lamps was a total mistake. First of all when I was ordering them the information was that that they are 4 3/4""diameter and the lamps that I have recieved were 6"" diameter. In this situatioon I attempted to return them for refund. This time another problem ocured. The software asked me the the quantity being returned and I entered 1 since originally the order calledfor 1 par (meaning two pieces). Unfortunately software unerstood that I'm returning 1 piece of lamp and it was impossible to change this. In this situation I have recieved refund for only one lamp even though I retrned 1par (meaning 2 pieces).This really was bad experience."
5,Good Machine,"I've had this machine for 3 months now. It is one the best investments I've made for my kitchen and my family. You could make your own breads with no preservatives and it is just sooo easy. A better aspect of this machine in comparison to the other breadmans is that it lets you do two breads at the same time, which just enough even for a family of two for a week.Just put the ingredients and let it do its magic. I even put more milk to make it have more calcium. The machine comes with its measurement tools and a recipe book. If you take care of it well, you would make it a part of your kitchen for many years. Wash the parts immediately and towell dry them. I highly recommend it."
3,Billy Shakespeare rules for baby tots!,i have a little baby who really digs this series. i couldn't beleive it but it was really great to see. So if there is any TV time for the wee one it is 15 minutes of this.
3,Baby Shakespeare,"My child enjoys the tape and that is good. He has enjoyed Baby Mozart and Baby Bach preceding this tape.My one problem with the tape is that both sexes are not represented. The creators apparently use their own children in the skits, who are all girls. I think both sexes should be represented. As it stands now , it sends a subtle and wrong message."
1,Rude and inappropriate for children,"For the most part, the video was fine, but was appalled by the incredibly rude behavior portrayed by the puppets. One scene clearly displays a flatulent cow puppet, while ""Bard"", the main character is often rude and ill-behaved. (In one scene he giggles because he threw a frog off a lily pad.) Besides this, Julie Clark's voice IS annyoying, and makes the poetry sound more like nursery rhymes. I highly discourage any concerned parent from purchasing this particular edition of the Baby Einstein series."
5,Baby Magic!,"We were introduced to this video when our daughter Grace was seven months old. I regret not having exposed her earlier, since she loved it right from the start. She is now 17 months old and we have gotten her the entire Baby Einstein collection. Amazingly she loves them all and has learned enthusiastically from all the videos. It is obvious to us that babies understand so much more than we can imagine and these videos are such a lovely introduction to learning."
1,made for the 1 and under set; not for older babies,"might be fun for the younger babes, but my son is 22 months, and he was only mildly interested and or amused in spots, otherwise he was bored and played with toys. he doesn't watch t.v. except for videos such as sesame street, french and spanish languages and thomas the tank engine. I'd hoped for much classical music, but was disappointed there, too. seemed to have way too much of the cutesy girls (ONLY GIRLS, WHAT BOYS DON'T MATTER?), lots of ambi brand toys rolling across the screen and far too much lame puppet action and too few shots of nature. this is the first and last of this genre i'm buying. aloha!"
4,As simple as it gets,"The product is simple and basically you get what you pay (I got it for less than $25 from a reseller). Open it, insert your 3.5 IDE HDD (easier said than done) and you are ready to go.It is *not* meant to be opened and closed several times as putting/removing the HDD is somewhat involved and you have to be careful not to break something.The fan has a switch and it the enclosure has both usb 2.0 and firewire 1394 interfaces (and cables)."
1,Save your money,Don't waste your money. Only sales people to benefit from your buying this book are the authors and publisher. Rated 1 star ONLY because -0- stars is not an option
4,4 stars only because of the cuts...,"I do understand the cuts and I was tickled with the two other reviews, particularly the one with the apology - shows integrity, spirit!At the moment, I'm hearing the Met production with Shicoff, of which there is a youtube available - please see it.I love Tucker's ""inside name"" - Rubin Ticker."
5,BEST AMP EVER,"THIS AMP IS GREAT NO NOISE AT ALL CRISP CLEAR SOUND MAKES ANY SPEAKER SOUND SUPER GREAT AND CLEAR I EVEN RAN THE STOCK SPEAKER AND THEY SOUND REALLY LOUD AND IT RUNS MY SUB PERFECT NICE AND DEEP, YOU JUST CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS AMP."
1,Dosen't work,"I bought this software and i instaleed it as usual then when i am ready to use it, it dosent work! I tried returning it and they wont even take it back. This product sucks!"
4,Very good,"Very good compilation!A lot of the songs come from the CDs ESCENAS DE AMOR (1982) and 15 EXITOS DE UNA GRAN DECADA (1990), which includes AY CARI√ëO and PASO LA VIDA PENSANDO. So, yes, those 2 songs were, indeed, previously available on CD by Globo Records, contrary to a previous posting."
3,BRAIN DEAD & Lost Highway,"I have never seen a reference to Brain Dead as having been one of the motivating precursors to the famous film, Lost Highway, but the similaities are very pronounced; from the subject matter of alternating or multiple realities, to the time loops, to even the same actor, Bill Pullman (although thanks to his fine acting range, it is like watching two completely different charactors).If you haven't seen Lost Highway yet, viewing Brain Dead beforehand should help you appreciate both films that much more. Yes, the scenes in the low-budget Brain Dead have far less atmosphere and props than Lost Highway, BUT then the cleverness of the plot does not seem so ""deliberately wrought"" with every viewing step of the way, as it can in Lost Highway."
2,farce or scary ?,"This film appeared to be going somewhere but became too convoluted for my taste. There seemed to be an uncomfortable fit between its comedy and its tradgedy : The bottled brains fell to the ground too many times and carrying one under the arm out of a science lab like a gold-fish seemed at odds to the switches of reality that bring home how scary madness is to the sufferer when the delusion of reality is all too real to the point of askance- ""maybe its the people around me that are playing tricks to make me think I'm mad. !!!.......""In this sense the film pushes paranoia to a higher dimension that could well be fascinating and scary to the viewers. Actually I just thought as a Brit I never did get American slap-stick humour ( Buster Keaton custard pies smashing bottled brains) So although this is a low star review you could probably enjoy it better."
3,hmmph.,Was entertaining I guess. The plot was ok the acting was horrible the story was a 4 star and the ending is unbelievable and was way far fetched. The human brain can not work without blood period.
5,One of the FUNNIEST Shows I've ever seen,This show is pure insanity. The jokes fly at you like sharp knives from hell. If you love Tim and Eric and if you love the simpsons. You will love Get A Life. It's so great.
5,Super-funny!,This was a long-awaited find. My friend in Virginia called to tell me it was available and I got online immediately to order it. It arrived less than 2 days later and I couldn't be more pleased! It's beautiful and hysterically funny!!
5,Great series. Great writers.,Great set of DVD's for a classic TV series. Granted the video quality of this set is not up to today's HDTV standards but it was produced in the early 90s. I am so glad they released the whole series finally. Very funny material with a lot of extra's on the DVD's. I highly recommend this to any Chris Elliott fan.
3,Get A Life is a classic show,So Happy that this DVD finally came out! They need to do it in Blue-Ray or a little better quality but good for now.
3,"Mostly common sense, tons of good advice","I bought this for my daughter, who really lacks a lot of knowledge about money. We did teach her but when she left home for her first ""real job"" she seemed to have forgotten how to manage her money. Most of the information presented is common sense advice about setting money aside for savings, not burying yourself in debt, etc. It's presented in a humorous, factual, matter-of-fact way that makes the content interesting.I did find some of the information a little condescending but mostly it's great. I've been managing my own money for 30 years and perhaps that's why I felt this way.This subject should be taught in middle to high school grade to every child in the US."
5,Inspiring,I saw this on PBS originally and knew right away I wanted the DVD. Suze is very inspiring and speaks in terms the everyday woman can understand.
4,Great Guitar,"I have owned my Oscar Schmidt for a few years now and it was a hand me down from my aunt. Mine is a older series and doesn't have the Washburn EQ. The guitar sounds great acoustic (more like amazing) but when plugged in, the Big E isn't very loud. That may be because of the age of the guitar and ware-and-tear that it has endured over the past years. Also when tuned down the Big E has a little fuzz when plugged in. I imagine it is a simple fix but I never play plugged-in, only purely acoustic so Im not to worried about it cuz like I said it sounds amazing unplugged."
3,"""What have you been eating?""","""Warriors of the Deep"" has always been highly criticised for being too cheap, too slow, and just down right bad! But it really isn't. It's one of the last of the 5th Doctor stories to have that Davison charm. The Silurians and the Sea Devils aren't that bad(even if they are slow moving, and their masks are coming loose), they appear right at the beginning of the story, rather than the end of episode 1. Although, the Myrka is better as an idea rather than a realisation. Nice cold war irony, nueral imputs, and some silly gun play add up to fun runaround with the regulars. An interresting story, often neglected."
4,Another story that builds on another,You can't watch this episode without going back to the Pertwee series and watching them all. If you don't you will miss all of the hidden double meanings.
1,Peter Davison would probably rather forget about this one.,"Follow-up to The Silurians and The Sea Devils. This story takes the creatures from two thought-provoking, excellent tales and turns out a boring, seen-it-all-before humans V evil rubber monsters scenario. And why on earth are the Sea Devils wearing metalic-looking dresses? One of the things that ruins the fear factor of Dr Who monsters all too often is that it's obvious they can't move fast enough to pose any real kind of a threat. And as for the Myrka, a supposedly powerful underwater beast. It's a green-painted pantomime horse! Had special effects regressed rather than progressed? Terrible, laughable, tedious rubbish!"
5,A unique story with a dream-like quality,"Wendy Lamb Books, 2005. Born in India and raised in Manitoba, Maya struggles to find her identity as the only brown-skinned kid in school. When her beautiful cousin, Pinky, arrives from India bearing a statue of the god Ganesh and proceeds to steal the boy Maya wants, Maya prays to Ganesh to remove all of her obstacles-with unintended consequences. A unique story with a dream-like quality that shows a young girl embracing her culture and learning about herself."
5,Great Book !,"I've been dying to read this book based on the reveiws.. When I saw it in the library, you can imagine that I grabbed it of the shelf ! Usually, I get too excited about books, and they turn out to be dissappointing.. But this was definetly worth it !! I love Maya's character and the whole plot that follows. I saw Ganesh in a new way, due to the way he talked to Maya and by his hungry actions, which was also very interesting ! Being Indian myself, I could relate to this book very well. This book was not only funny, but it gives a good lesson near the end.. This has to be my favorite book of all time !"
2,Unauthentic,"I read this book and felt like it was unauthentic. I would not recommend this book to a friend or for an elementary school curriculum. It would give them a completely unreal depiction of India and Indians. I lived in India for 5 years so I have a pretty good idea of what life there compared to here is like. The whole Ganesha part of the book was just confusing and weird, and didn't really make sense. Overall, the book was a sluggish read, and had a pretty bad storyline. It was interesting at times though, so I gave it 2 stars."
1,A Sad Attempt To Close A Once-Wonderful Series,"This show survived for 26 years and they end the show with a story about Darwin's famous phrase, ""Survival of the fittest."" Doctor Who began as the lion of the kingdom and went out as the worm in the dirt.This story could have been so much better if the Cheetah people would have been approached from a different route. They needed to be more ominous, more devious like cats are stereotyped to be. It was depressing to see the Master be reduced to using cats as his means of getting power. When I look back as the Delgado Master, he would have never used such primitive means of achieveing power.This story was disappointing. I bought it hoping that the final episode would be one of the classics. Instead, I fell asleep during 'Part Two.' Come one, McCoy, get with the picture."
1,Belongs in the Cat Litter.,"It was an act of mercy when the show ended, all the way through the eighties it had limped along with fewer and fewer viewers. The vet should have put it down in 1981."
4,Last of 'classic' Doctor Who,"This was the last episode of the 'classic' episodes as the BBC calls it (1963 through 1989). It hints to things to come from the new series such as the Cat people as seen in a few of episodes of the new Doctor Who series ('New Earth' and end of 'Grid lock' among others) which came out in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston.While the special effects might be dated compared to todays series is was not bad for its time either.This is the last time you see the 'Master' until the new series as well.While a did not like Anthony Ainley when I first saw the series in the late eighties I have to admit I prefer Anthony over the new ""master' of the new series."
4,"Though imcomplete, any Tom Baker fan still should get this.","I just watched Shada 2 nights ago, and let me preface this review by saying that Tom Baker always was, and always will be my favorite Doctor. Having said that, I'll probably always enjoy any Doctor Who episode that has Mr. Baker in it, and Shada was no exception. I believe this would have been a 4 1/2 to 5 star episode, had it been completed. There really wasn't nearly as much narration, as I thought there'd be. The video runs about 110 minutes, and I'm guessing that there's about 15 to 20 minutes of narration in the entire video. The main problem with the narrated parts, is that most of the climax of the episode is narrated. Which is kind of disappointing. But, I felt that the rest of the episode was quite good, and really was better than I had been led to believe. For any 4th Doctor fans out there, you really must get this to complete your collection. Although, I'd buy it cheaper than this. I really don't think you'll be too disappointed."
3,A five star script that was sadly never completed on screen.,"I love Tom Baker's Doctor as well as Douglas Adams' scripts, and this might have been one of their very bests if only it had been completed. Due to a BBC strike, this story was cancelled halfway through. This video contains all the footage that was filmed along with newly added music and special effects and the rest is narrated by Tom Baker himself. Although this is a great story and Tom Baker's narration is brilliant, it still feels as if you are cheated when watching this because the gaps in the story are big and no matter how good the narration is, it's still just a narration. Worth a look at, but this video is not really that great which is a shame because this is certainly a five star story."
3,Shada,It has certainly been compromised from its original complete form quite a bit but the story still comes through with Tom Baker's narration. The invisible spaceship does give it a differnt twist even though this is not an original idea for a story. I would recommend it for any Dr. Who fan.
3,doctor who-shada,this is a good video with the only down side of the footage being narrated. however because Tom Baker is my favorite doctor i do recommed this. who-ites will recognize some of the footage from the five doctors. all around good story and plot line
3,Satisfy your curiosity about.....,"the untold Doctor Who story, the only problem is, much of it was unfilmed and although the narration by Tom Baker fills in the gaps, be prepared to sell it back once you watch it once....."
3,Would have been an average movie.,"Shada would have been an average Tom Baker movie, but the BBC strike stoped production. It's worth buying and adding to your collection, but don't expect this story being one that sticks out in your mind for very long."
4,A true champion,"Bailey tells the story of his sometimes rocky rise through the ranks of the jockey colony to become the premier rider in the world. He doesn't hold back any in discussing his battle with alcoholism and how it nearly ruined him and his family. It's an honest self appraisal by a man with an enormous talent for his craft, yet glaring weaknesses that almost denied racing fans the opportunity to watch his genius at work."
2,transportationnof item,"the item ordered was not expensive but I paid to get it quick and it took 9 days to get here. It was too late, but do to the price it wasn't worth returning."
5,Great book for horse racing fans,This is a wonderful personal insight into the life of one of the sport's greatest jockeys.
2,AAA Review,"Book is mainly about his personal battle with alcohol and his resulting ""wondeful"" family life.Would like to have seen more racing industry insights and information!"
3,I'd congratulate Jerry..........,"....but he does so much of it himself. I've always admired Bailey for his professionalism as a jockey and applaud his having overcome addiction, but was put off by his repeated blowing of his own bugle, so to speak. I cringed at times. It might have been better left to a biographer, with quotes from Bailey relative to his recovery from alcoholism.On another front, I do think that Jerry Bailey does a nice job as a television commentator.P.S. Still not buying the excuse for his Belmont tactics with Eddington."
4,panini machine,"The shipping was quick, and the panini maker works pretty well. I just wish the plates were removable for easier cleanup."
1,Breadman TR456 is the worst appliance I have ever had,"I have been buying on the net for years and have always found the reviews helpful. After extensive investigation I settled on this Breadman. The first time I used it I was thrilled with it's performance and the ease of clean-up--the second time as well. The third time the entire breadman fell apart. Parts from the hinges and screws bounced all over the floor. My husband who is not particularly mechanical worked an hour on it and couldn't get it back together. It will cost me more to pack it and return it than it is worth, but I wanted to warn everyone how poorly made this is so that you do not make the same mistake I did."
4,Product review,"Can't say much because I returned the delivery. Didn't need it after all however, It arrived in time. Kudos to the seller and it's carrier service."
4,A very good panini maker,"We have used the panini maker once so far, with very positive results. They turned out just like the panini sandwiches you can get in a restaurant, grilling the sandwiches evenly on both sides. It was very easy to use and clean. Only complaints: there is no on/off button, so you have to remember to unplug it as soon as you are done, and there are a few warnings in the directions that you need to be careful when the maker is open that it doesn't accidently close on you while putting the panini in or cleaning it. This didn't happen to us, but you could see how that might happen. All in all, so far we are happy with this product."
3,It does what it's supposed to...nothing more,"It does what it's supposed to...nothing moreAs a sandwich press its great. The nonstick is durable, the heat is good, and it can handle thick sandwiches fairly well. But, it's very hard to clean, there is no external heat control, and there is no on/off switch (you need to unplug it to turn it off). This is less than convenient, if you do not have easy access to a power outlet.It is great at doing what it is supposed to do, but its devoid of any extra luxuries."
2,Another poor packaging issue!!!,"Received item very quickly, but that doesn't matter if it's broken (especially when I paid $12 shipping!!!) I could hear something rattling as soon as I picked up my package off the front porch. Turns out the indicator light bulb is busted. I wouldn't necessarily mind, but it's a gift that now after paying extra shipping will still come AFTER Christmas!!!Item was in original box inserted into a UPS shipping BAG (no extra box)!!! Now Amazon is instructing ME to secure the package for return shipping!!! I don't think so!!"
3,Panini maker,"This package arrived with a big tear in the sideof cardboard box. This is a gift so I hope there is no damageto the panini maker itself.Sincerely,Nancy Moore"
5,Very pleased,"I have looking into getting one of these for a while. But I didn't want to spend $150, so I got this one. It works wonderfully! I have used it several times, even to make desserts, which turned out great. You just have to remember to shut it off, and to use a pan holder to open it. The extra effort is worth the price to me. It is very easy to clean as well. After it's cooled I just set a damp cloth in it for a few minutes and everything comes right off. I like how it has the adjustable hinge as well. I'm very glad I got this."
4,A good product,"I bought this panini maker for my husband, because he loves panini. We have used it several times and it works great! I read all the reviews on all the different panini makers and I chose this one. It is much less expensive than all the other ones and it still works well. If you don't want anything fancy or expensive you will get great sandwiches from this machine."
5,Simple Sandwich Maker,"The Breadman TR456 Panini Maker is very easy to use and makes great grilled sandwiches. The unit heats quickly, the floating hinge cooks evenly and the grill plates are large enough to handle 2 very large or 4 regular sized sandwiches. Clean up is easy too as the grill plates are non-stick."
3,"Cooks good, cleans bad","We received this panini press as a gift and were instantly delighted with the delicious sandwiches we could make on it. Several months have passed now and the cleaning issue is becoming more and more of a problem. The ridges on the grill that toast the panini so well are very tedious to clean between and this is especially a problem on the bottom surface where there is a lip around the perimeter. Anything you wipe from those grooves has to be lifted over the lip and it doesn't always work. In fact, it never seems clean now and I'm ordering the Cuisinart model today which seems to be the only one with removable grilling surfaces."
4,"Nice Unit, works well","I've always wanted to make my own Panini and when there was a sale for the Breadman, I had to get it. A fairly simple unit to use, just plug it in. The rear hindge lifts up so that you can place your sandwich in without getting that wedge effect. Even heating and the non-stick grooves are a easy to clean. I knocked it down one star because I wished it had a temperature adjustment knob on it. This is essentiall a large george foreman grill."
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"The Panini, Breadman TR456 is just fantastic. This is the second one purchased in our family. My daughter bought one and we used it on father's day. We had different types of breads, cheeses,ham etc. and everyone could make their one panini. It was great! and the clean up is a breeze.This one I bought for my sister who was visiting from Santo Domingo and we celebrated her birthday making quesadillas.It has a sleek design and you can place it on the counter so you can use it any time you want anything toasted/delicious!"
2,Should have just looked up the info.,"Ok, there was some good information in here. It just could have been summed up in one page. The articles are repetitive throughout."
3,Bliss or Boredom; What's your cup of tea?,"The book itself was not very grand or exceptionaly written. It spanned a short period of time, and didn't get you very involved with the characters. It almost seemed like a recap of some greater story - dry. To the credit of the book, it had a very original premise, and an imaginitive story. If you are a Christopher Pike fan, or someone who enjoys this type of Sci-Fi fantasy, then you would probably get a pleasureable experience out of this book, perhaps even be touched, for it does have that possibility. In this case the plot would more then make up for the poor character sketches. On the other hand, someone not already accustomed to this style/type of story might find alot of fault, and a mediocre novel."
2,WARNING! WARNING! WARNING: FOR EXTREME DIE-HARD FANS ONLY!!!,This was the worse Pike book ever. This was the third Pike book I read and almost stopped reading his books if I hadn't been bored one day and picked up Scavenger Hunt which is a much better book. Star Group just seemed too out there and too thrown together.
3,I was wrong,"I thought this book looked really really good. I did not like it at all. Yeah, the characters were realistic, but it just wasn't what I hoped it would be."
4,Good,"This isn't one of his finest books, but still it was an alright read. I read it in about 2 hours and usually his books take me at least 3. The ending wasnt up to C Pike's usual standard, and the plot wasnt as surprising as usual. I still give this book a 7 out of 10 as the book started off well and did maintain some interest throughout the rest of the book."
4,i thought this was a really good book,"well on my copy the back of the book is wrong but thats ok (its says that there are 4 girls), but i still really liked this book. ive read all of chirstopher pikes books and i liked this one it reminded me of The Visitor i would recomend it to anyone if u liked The Visitor u will like this but the visitor's plot is a little more twisted"
2,Not Good,The story seemed thrown together at the last minute and was not as good as other Pike novels. The ending was not a surprise as most of Christopher Pike's novels.
3,incomplete,"I'm a major Pike fan, i own 29 of his books and read 22 of his books. The other books i've read by him i got a sense of them being complete, full and besides wondering how he wrote such novels and a wish for more sequels, i never had any questions. This book to me felt incomplete.There's a lot of foreshadow he could've used, especially with the details on the waves and how Danny waterskied and more about his love for Gale. All I wondered was besides mentor's disapproval how else was the scene significant to the plot of the story? I don't mean to spoil the book for those who didn't read it. The book started out beautifully, but from middle to end it felt like a waste and that he was in a hurry. It had a lot of promise, and I personally wish he would rewrite it. I would try to rewrite it, but then that'll be considered illegal."
3,"""Actually...I'm looking forward to it...""","Enter the Master, renegade Time Lord, helping the Nestenes/Autons to try and conquer the Earth again(oh, yes, and kill the Doctor)! For a four-parter, it feels a little padded. The Master isn't half bad in his debut. Although, both Richard Franklin and Katy Manning seem a little stiff in this story. Jo's character is written horribly! Plus, there doesn't seem to be any need to have the Autons, like their a third wheel. There is some good action, nice stunts, and a decent UNIT romp. CSO in this story is bad as it ever was, just rotten! A memorable slice of Who nastalgia!"
5,Review from the Publisher,"A thorough biography of the founder of the Jesuits and the author of the famous ""Spiritual Exercises"" (which have formed saints and apostles for centuries). Does not skip his miracles. Describes the founding and structure of the Jesuits and how this remarkable order had an immediate and profound effect upon the Christian world. One of the most influential men and one of the most influential order in the history of the Church."
3,good but not as good as underground network,"this cd would be good, if it werent for the first 8 songs, the live songs are amazing, but the first 8 are too whiney, if you want good anti-flag get underground network, if you want even better music get a thought riot cd, there amazingly good, but i was disapointed by this cd, well the first 8 tracks"
5,ANTI-FLAG is the sickest band ever,"ANTI-FLAG is the sickest band ever! It live versins of some of there best songs like Die for your government and underground network and then it has 8 new songs. Resistance, Underground Network, A New Kind of Army, and Die for Your Government are good songs...."
5,Incredible,"I have yet to listen to previous Anti-Flag albums, but in listening to ""Mobilize"", I have come to like their music. They have brought the original punk sound of The Sex Pistols and The Clash to a new generation. The new album is incredible, and I recommend it to anyone who listens to punk music."
2,Good but Bad CD,"Anti-Flag's newest CD is good but also really bad. There is only 8 new songs, and 8 live tracks that get old. The 8 new songs are good, and have strong messages, but they have that ""Anti-Flag"" sound that stays the same. So there is nothing new with this CD, but you do get the A-F records sampler that is hard to find right now. I gave it 2 stars for most of the reasons above, but on track 16 skip around and you will find funny things, like Anti-Flag playing the song ""Then I Got High"" and some other weird stuff. So buy this CD if you want, but it's not Anti-Flag's best stuff."
1,Not Impressed,"I was required to use this book for a course on VC in my MBA program, and I found overly wordy and not very precise in its advice.It is less of a handbook and more of a treatise. If you are looking for a direct and clear scoop on raising venture capital, this isn't the book for you. If you have been trying for some time and want to get a deep peek into the minds of the VC's out there, this could work if you had the time to wade through it."
3,Adequate Performance,"This device does what it was intended to do but less than it promises. The remote control and playback work as expected, and it is easy to install. The video output, however, is crude: just barren type on a monitor or TV. The choices of control via the video connection are basic--play songs in the iPod in alphabetical order once you select an artist or album. You have much better control using the included remote and gazing across the room with binoculars than relying on the video the device sends to a monitor."
5,Baby Einstein Kudos,"I received this collection as a gift at a baby shower. All the moms there assured me that my baby would enjoy these (earlier than I might expect). Were they ever correct. I first popped one in the VCR when our son was 10 weeks old. I had never seen him so animated. He was amazingly attentitive to the pictures. He kicked and flapped his arms so much his bouncer seat was really rocking! He is now 9 months old, and we watch one every day (it's nice to have three videos to rotate, so I don't lose my sanity). He starts kicking and smiling as soon as the opening screen comes up. The videos really grow with him -- he enjoys aspects now that he didn't earlier, and some of the things that used to amuse him don't anymore. But he watches them in their entirety every time. He even watches the end portion where she explains the research behind the videos. It gives me a welcome hands-free 30 minutes to eat my lunch, or catch up on a few things, and I know it's quality stuff he's viewing."
5,Attention Captured!,"These videos are GREAT! My 7month old is absolutely mesmerized for the entire 30minutes of each. We started her out at 1month and she seems to enjoy them more each time she sees them. Good to buy tired Moms & Dads a 30min break now and then. If your kid is going to watch TV anyway, this is prob better than the rugrats.... Only prob was the recording tape quality was poor in place .. might be worth getting the DVD version."
5,My 8 month old loves it!,My 8 month old loves these tapes! She would watch them over and over if I would let her. I would highly suggest them for almost all age children.
4,Masada Bath Salts,All of the Masada bath salts seem to work well for my sore legs. Just add 1-2 cups to warm/hot bath and soak for 15+ minutes. Good way to recover from hard workouts.
2,Overpowering,"This stuff stinks! My entire 1,000 square foot apartment smelled like cheap air freshener. However, my mother-in-law was visiting and thought the smell was lovely. Still, I wouldn't risk buying this. Just try one of the other scents instead-they can't be worse."
1,"Boring, Dry and Bland","I made this cupcakes after biting the bullet because they are way too expensive for a mix, but I hoped for the best. They were rather dry and donuty and the frosting had an off unpleasant taste. I'm not sure but the vanilla in the frosting tasted artificial. I would not reccommend this mix because of the high price and rather low quality."
2,Great idea but too much power!,"I received this for a Christmas present. I just tried it out and am disappointed. I loved the spinner part, but the slicing and grating part was just too much. It totally mushed my cucumber. The motor is so strong that my arm hurts from holding it down so it wouldn't jump all over the counter. It actually unplugged itself one time cause it was jumping all around. While it's a great idea, it's a bit much for using it for what it's intemded."
5,"great item, saves great amount of energy","this item takes up a good amount of space once it is on the counter, but it was a godsend this summer when my garden crop was proving more bountiful than I could consume! This item made it easy to get the greens and lettuces cleaned to either consume or contribute to friends. removes soil and all other things that like to hang on from the garden, great item, would definitely recommend to a friend."
3,112 pages for $53.00? Hmmm...,"I'm used to seeing overpriced textbooks and other computer-related books. 112 pages for $53.00? Give me a break! I suppose this is just about the right length for a busy CEO who would prefer to read the ""highlights"" in the field, and not take the time to develop a more in-depth understanding. When I become a CEO and have a spare $53.00 to spend, I'll provide a substantive review of this book. Caveat Emptor!"
4,Great Album.,"If are looking for music beyond the ordinary then try thiscd.This album is perfect for meditation or if you would like achange of pace.Craig Padilla is a great artist this album will becomea classic in the music world. ,Thanks travler"
2,Boring noodling instead of atmosphere,"If you are going to do a soundscape, you need artistry. ""Forgotten places,"" is an example of a good soundscape. ""The Pearl,"" is another. Just recording a pulse and noodling over it for an hour is not enough. Anyone can do that. Sorry I bought this one. I was hoping for a great arctic soundscape. This did not evoke anything about the icy poles."
4,Enjoying a Little Known Opera in a Big Way....,"Don't miss this fine production of Giordano's Fedora. Rarely performed, but brought to sparkling life by the Met in 1996, it is now reproduced on a DVD. Not only were they wise enough to use the production of the Gran Teatro Del Liceu in Barcelona, which is magnificent, but they enticed Mirella Freni and Placido Domingo to sing the lead roles. These singers are well matched with their mature, elegant, rich voices. Dwayne Croft and Jean-Yves Thibaudet complement them to perfection. It is such a thrill to enjoy a nicely put together performance of this melodrama one never gets to see ""live""."
3,"great taste, bad consistency","What I like about this product:Tastes greatDoesn't cause gasWhat I dislike:The consistency/texture is terrible. No matter how much you stir and stir and stir, it doesn't completely disolve. You end up with lumps/clumps of chocolate powder floating on top of the milk. Maybe it would work better if you use a blender."
4,run a virus scanner and use a firewall?!,"Colarik's advice is pretty sensible and presented in as nontechnical a manner as possible. I don't think anyone can quarrel about the proferred advice. Though I'm a little dubious of ""Executive"" in the book's title. Perhaps he's trying to appeal to the ego of the reader. Or perhaps it's just a way to underline that this is not a specialised technical book.There are explanations of various types of attacks that your computer might meet. And protective, largely preventive countermeasures on your part. For this, the best advice might be to install an antivirus scanner and regularly run it. Along with having it connect to its vendor's website, to download the latest virus signatures. Another good advice is to consider running a firewall. These days, you might not even need a dedicated device. Software firewalls are now quite refined."
3,NOT REALLY WHAT I WANTED,I WAS LOOKING FOR THE BAGS THAT HAVE THE BUTTONS ALREADY MOLDED ON THE BAG NOT TE ONES THAT YOU PUT ON.THESE TEND TO WRINKLE
5,7.3 powerstroke turbodiesel rail fuel pump,this unit slipped right into the oem spot and was easy to connect- Two wires and two fuel lines. works and looks like oem. This unit installs in the oem bracket so your old one will be retained. install tools note- you will need small metric sockets and small metric wrenches
2,Old fashioned and boring,If you like books about nothing or books about people with no real aim in life continually talking about nothing then this is the book for you.
2,pleasant but dull,"I'm not an action junkie, so I thought I could certainly appreciate the portrait of an area, its inhabitants and their lifestyles, as in one of my absolute favorites: That Old Ace in the Hole. I forced myself to finish this one, though. I was just never invested in any of the characters, didn't care about the outcome. Makes me wonder how I differ from all those rave reviewers on the jacket."
3,Not as special as I expected,"I think this is a nice book but not outstanding in my opinion. That clearly goes against many reviewers, several have said that it is one of the top books they have ever read! I will not suggest that you skip it because it may be special to you..."
4,Good 6th Doctor 1st Episode,"How could you possibly say this is the worst episode in the series. Paradise Towers has got to be the absolute worst Doctor Who ever. I felt embarassed to watch such garbage. The music, effects, companions and stories that were given to the seventh Doctor stunk. It was no wonder the series was cancelled."
4,"Well, at least it is Dr Who.",He just regenerated and had over acted mood swings. The story was OK other than the mood swings..... After all it is the Doctor.
1,Trash. Colin Baker unstimulating,"Overall, this is one of the worst Doctor who serials of all time. Colin Baker's potrayal of the Doctor is so over the top that one wonders if he is in the right show. The guest cast isn't much better. I feel that Anthony Stevan's Script was totally ruined by the Script editor's re written one. Not much money was spent on this one but it ultimately fails because the production crew were attempting to centre around the sixth Doctor's new persona and regeneration failure. Not a good one to analyse. END"
1,What in the name of time is this?,"Howcome BBC Video still haven't released 'Revalation of the Daleks' on tape and yet this wretched story is readily available to demonstrate the depths even the most watchable sci-fi series can sink to. This is Colin Baker's debut story. Now, it has been said that any Doctor's first story has to be weak so that it doesn't steal the new Doctor's limelight. But surely this is taking matters to extremes! The Doctor tries to sing, tries to stangle his companion and laughs a lot in one of the biggest displays of abominable acting I've ever come across. Maybe the Doctor having a nervous breakdown seemed like an interesting concept on paper, but when I first saw this story on TV in thought it was the end of one of my favourite series. You can imagine the huge power surge across the country as everybody switched their TVs off in unison.Absolute...no, I'm sorry, a word has yet to be invented. This doesn't even deserve one star."
3,Our genius has been abused!,"With the exception of some horrible dialogue, sleepwalking acting, and the Doctor's insanity scenes, and giant slugs, and the fact that it's two episodes too long, and that it followed one of the greatest Who stories ever, ""The Twin Dilemma"" is a little tolerable. Well, maybe not for everone's taste, but there's a little fun to be had here, you just have to look real close and sort of squint your eyes...but it's there! There's no awards here for brilliance, but like many bad Who stories, they do have their own kind of charm(sort of). But even Eric Saward should of seen a few signs that maybe this wasn't the right script...."
2,Don't Let This Be Your First Date,"Let it be known first and foremost, that I like Colin Baker's take on Dr. Who. In fact, I think that season 22 was one of the best seasons of the 80's. That being said The Twin Dilemma was not in season 22, nor was this the best episode of Colin Baker's tenure as the doctor. This is the only Dr. Who episode that I have fallen asleep through every time I have watched it, which includes the time I taped it in the 80's. I only bought it because I am a hardcore fan and completist. If you are looking to just get into classic Dr. Who I would recommend titles such as The Caves of Androzani, The Green Death, The War Machines, or The Genesis of the Daleks as good starters. If you want to check Colin Baker out then get Vengeance on Varos first and work from there. The Twin Dilemma is not a good episode to watch if you are just getting into classic Dr. Who."
5,Polish,"I bought this DVD the day it went on sale and have watched it at least 10 times. All I have to say is this DVD shows us why The O'Jays are considered the best entertainers that ever did it. After 50 years in show business, their show is still polished like fine china. Don't slepp on this one, get it and see why they are still a main attraction"
4,Very Entertaining!,This is a very entertaining concert. It's great to see old favorites (and new ones) performed live. This group still can sing! The interview and storytelling is also very interesting and revealing. I recommend this concert.
5,A Delightful R&B Blu-Ray Concert,"In the fifteen months since I bought my Blu-ray disk player I've visited Amazon.com just about every week searching for Blu-ray concert disks of classic Rock and Roll, R&B;, and Jazz artists. The selection available is very limited. To date none of the DVD releases of T. J. Lubinsky & Shout Factory (the PBS series), or of B.E.T. Entertainment have made the transition to Blu-Ray.This disk by the O'Jays was a pleasant surprise. Lead singer Eddie Levert may no longer be as nimble on stage but is still very delightful to watch. Video quality of the disk is excellent. Audio is also very good except that the subwoofer of my sound system did not kick in throughout the entire concert. Get a copy; you'll love it."
5,Just like being there!!!,"I loved the concert!!! Shared it with my family and it was just like we were there. The Ojays just get better with time. The music was clear, the color was great. They gave a great performance. If you buy this you will love it."
1,Disappointed!,"I love the OJAYS so when I received my blueray disk, I was ready to Party! Little did I know that this disk would not play in my blue ray player! I passed it on to a few of my friends & it didn't work in their players either. A friends' son has a game station (psp3?) or one of those newer versions & it played on his machine. So I haven't even seen this concert yet!"
1,Disappointed in MD,I cannot rate this DVD because there is nothing on it to view. I was quite anxious to see this with my friends but quite disappointed to see nothing on this tape.
2,defective copy,defective copy concerts ends in the middle of Wildfire and does not restart for the completion of the other two tracks.
2,needs better editor,"The Hawaiian setting attracted me to this (kindle) book, but the English and Hawaiian spelling errors were distracting from the story. Characters were interesting, but the story was sometimes too simple. I may try another book, if only to redeem the credibility of the author and publisher."
2,"Not too bad, but hardly 5 star...","Some of the other reviewers have said he is better than Clancy... not hardly. Tom Clancy got the details right, which Mark Joseph does not. He uses the term ""chaff"" to describe underwater decoys; chaff is an air burst of strips of tin foil, used to confuse radar. It would be useless underwater. Mark also uses the term ""steer left 3 degrees"", rather than the correct ""left three degrees rudder"". Also, for a crewman to have a compartment, albeit a small one, on an attack sub for his private use, is really comical; it wouldn't happen; space is too scarce on a sub. Every compartment is accounted for and used.It's not a bad book, but not a 5-star book."
5,Potemkin,"This will be the seond copy of the book. I read it first back in the mid to late 80s.In fact I read it just after reading ""Hunt for Red October"". I was wanting more books on submarines (Fiction or Non Fiction did not mater). To Kill the Potemkin is a good book for the technology that is well thought out and the humor and sarcastic style of humor not too unlike David Spade although years before David Spade came on the tube and film. IF you like submarines and action and humor then you will love this book.Jim FaradayThe Hunt for Red OctoberTo Kill the Potemkin (Onyx)"
4,Good plot but somehow poor in submarine tactics,"This book is surely a nice submarine thriller, with the story taking place in May 1968. Mark Joseph paints his characters with vivid colors and his dialogues are really enjoying but except for a few tips in submarine tactics, he didn't impress me so much. The use of passive and active sonars (""echo ranging"" is the term used for the latter) was rather generally explained and the role of hiding behind or above thermal layers was not explored in depth. I think this book ranks lower than Patrick Robinson's ""Nimitz Class"" in terms of pure action, but it earns the fourth star for its very realistic finale."
3,The Pretenders 2 Album Review,"They did not pick up from where they left off and made a better 2nd album. There sophmore effort was just not that good. The first album had like 4 songs I liked. 1 song I love which is ""up the neck"". The only song I like on this album is "" message of love"" thats the best song imo off the album. Then there a few mediocre/average songs like talk of the town and a few others but basically this album is not worthing paying $10 for."
4,Great follow up release,"Day After Day could carry an album all by itself. Fortunately it doesn't have to. If you are a fan of the Pretenders, you have to have this one."
2,I was expecting better from Mobile Fidelity,I have a few of the older gold cd's from mfsl that are really a notch above anything else that was available. Great care was taken on each recording to get them to sound as best as possible before they were sold. Pretenders II and a few of the other mfsl discs I have bought lately actually sound worse than the regular cd releases. I dont get it. I say this in hopes that mfsl gets it together again so I can get some great sounding cd's from them again.
4,Okay - I bought the re-issue...,"I wasn't gonna, but then I did...I broke down and bought the re-issue. I'll probably go back and buy the re-issue of the debut album, too, because I enjoy the hell out of this one!The music itself is still as fresh and rocking and pleasing as it was when I first bought the vinyl version way back when it was released. Seeing them on that tour in Pittsburgh was one of my favorite concert experiences as well. Now, with the extra concert bonus stuff on disc two, it is that much more difficult to stop listening to it over and over and over! I get just as frustrated as the next working stiff when I face the prospect of buying a disc I already own just to pick up more stuff, but this is a legitimate case for dropping the dime. If you need to, sell the original to a store that buys back used discs and get some in-store credit towards something else or better yet, a few bucks for some refreshments! If you like this album, you'll love the re-issue. Viva the Pretenders!"
3,Disturbing trend,"This is a Review of the SACD layer.I have about 5 of these MOFI stereo CD's now. All have the same problem...no high end. Just a thuddy, muddy low end party. You cant adjust enough to bring the treble out of the mess.Now, the Album, the music, is superb. Who doesn't like the Pretenders? This master is just too bassy, like a lot of the cassettes you used to buy."
2,Not a success,"I loved the Pretenders so was very excited to see this Mofi SACD available. However the sound was disappointing compared to other premium CDs I have listened to. On my good quality audio system, the sound was pretty harsh."
5,The live tracks are awesome!,"I was there - on one of our first few dates with my new girlfriend, who is now my wife of almost 30yrs. The live tracks are great - brings back great memories. For those not there, the energy and riffs of the live versions go great against the studio tracks."
4,wish I'd watched it sooner,"This movie was very interesting. As with most of Sammo's movies, they're always great, but rather confusing at times..maybe its because the lack of translation with the Chinese/English. But if you're a fan of Sammo or Yuen, you shouldn't be disappointed. I bought the movie just because the incredibly talented Mr. Biao is in it..never disappoints me..His pole scene at the beginning is fantastic, running through a mine field hysterical..and the fight between Sammo and Yuen was awesome. I had this dvd for 6 months before I watched it. Now I wish I had watched it sooner. Anita Mui has ""quite a set of legs"" as my guy friends put it! She's incredible. Don't watch it for the history, watch it if you like the cast."
2,Shanghai Shanghai,"I am a little let down with this one. I'm not sure what catagory this movie was intened for but given the cast I thought it was a martial arts movie. If this was its goal I'm afraid it comes up a bit short. There is some sparse action sprinkled about, but it's not enough for it to get by on. Sammo Hung and Anita Mui only get one chance to show off their skills near the end, and even then is is only a fair display of their talents. As for the story line, maby it was just poorly subtiled. I had an unusualy difficult time trying to make sense of what was going on and who people were. Still if you are a fan of the cast, some of it is rather enjoyable and worth seeing once. A little tip, stick with the Mandarin track, the Cantonese needs help. If your looking for something to own along the same lines I recomend ""My Father is a Hero."" with Jet Li and Anita Mui."
2,Fulfilling a Dream,"The book purportedly has 26 ideas (A to Z) but being a consultant, she gave very little away to the reader. One would just have to read and make the quantum leap yourself. Most of the more detailed sharing were from her days at Target. All in all, the book fulfils her dream of writing and publishing a book and that is about it."
1,Worst (or second worst) regeneration story ever.,"This is actually neck-in-neck with Colin Baker's horrible regeneration story 'The Twin Dilemma'. This mess isn't really Sylvester McCoy's fault. The script is wretched, the plot is nonsensical (even by Who standards), and the Rani actually seems to be looking at the TV audience at one point. Ugh. It, like all of McCoy's first season, also commits the cardinal sin of being both excruciating and boring. Don't give up on McCoy though. Check out some of his stories from later in his run like Remembrance of the Daleks and Curse of Fenric."
1,an unfortunate start,"Bad decisions by the BBC, further bad producing by JNT and bad writing make this perhaps the worst first episode ever for any emerging Doctor. If you are a completist, you'll have to get it and I'm sure there must be some saving grace in the episode, though none comes to mind except maybe Syl McCoy should be given some pity for having to put up with a horrible, horrible first season. He's the only one I don't blame for this science fiction abortion. If I could give this story a negative 3 I would. Could be worse though. It could be Dragonfire."
1,"if 0 stars were possible, I know who I'd give it to...","basically, Time And The Rani is one of the worst stories in excistance. First off, Kate O'Mara returns as the Rani, with a garbled and convoluted plan of creating a ""Time Manipulator."" We are never told what this is, and her explanation of how to make it is total gobbledeegook. Sylvester McCoy is not all that bad as the Seventh Doctor, but Bonnie Langford does little more than scream as Mel. The Tetraps look nasty, but get virtually nothing to do. The Lakertyans are laughable excuses for aliens, particularly due to their amusing haircuts. The script is pointless and over-complicated, and the incidental music is irritating. The new themetune is okay, but a bit silly. The whole jazzy feel is rather silly, and so overall, it's just awful."
2,Doesn't boad well for the seventh personna,"What a waste. Colin Baker's unceremonious firing as the (sixth)Doctor the preveous season dooms this one from the very begining and we have a chessy regeneration scene. The story (written by the horrible Pip & Jane Baker)is bad, the cliffhangers are awful and while there are some decent special effects, the make-up and costumes are hideous. It only gets two stars becuase it is Dr. Who and I don't have the heart to give it only one."
1,Zero stars would be too good ...,"Perhaps the worst episode of ALL the Doctor's adventures. Colin Baker's campy era ended and a newer reign of schlock and bad taste began. Don't get me wrong, I love Sylvester McCoy...it is the rest of the series at this time that I hate. Bad scripting, horrid acting, an attempt at racey sexuality which would only entice the most pockmarked pubescent male audience members into thinking the Doctor has entered a new realm of adult entertainment, it all spells disaster. Obviously no one except the die hard fan would watch this thing. Avoid at all costs."
3,"A new Doctor , A new look!","The TARDIS is hijacked by the Rani.After landing the Doctor is forced to change his body. Mel is left in the ship while the Rani deals with the Doctor.Mel is taken out of the TARDIS, by the local aliens. The Rani is using the Doctor to further her work on the planet . Mel eventually finds the Doctor and helps him defeat the Rani!The Rani flees but is recaptured by her henchmen,the tetraps! Next stop Paradise Towers!"
2,Too Much Downward Dog,"I've taken pilates classes before and done various pilates and yoga DVDs. I didn't expect this to be a strictly pilates video (it's based on both pilates and yoga, which is obvious from the ""For Fat Burning"" part of the title).The choreography is fine. I like the incorporations of the different elements of pilates and yoga. However, she goes back to Downward Dog way too often. Halfway through the workout, I had to stop because my wrists were hurting and I was starting to get a headache from being upside down so often.The videographer should have shot from different angles, because you see the instructor (and her back-up people) mostly from one angle, and sometimes it was hard to tell about depth (how much they were bending in one direction relative to another, etc).If you want an aerobic, pilates-based workout, try Crunch Fitness' ""Fat-Burning Pilates"" instead."
3,Mini Ab-Blaster Does the Trick!,"After using the library copy of this video, I bought it purely for the Mini Ab-Blaster that is included in the bonus features. It is about 10 minutes long, and has amazing results. You really feel it the next day!"
2,More Yoga than Pilates,"I was very disappointed with this video to be quite honest. I have been doing pilates for years, both in the studio/gym setting and also pilates dvds and found this to be more yoga than pilates. It was very hard on my wrists constantly going from the plank to childs pose etc.. If you are a yoga enthusiast and looking to venture out into pilates, this might be the video for you, but if you are looking for a vigorous mat-based pilates workout, I'd pick something else. I love Ana Caban's Cardio Pilates to get my core workout."
2,Not what I expected,"I was not happy with this product. I was expecting something that would be more fat-burning-like, as the name suggests. Instead, it's more like regular Pilates, except hardcore, causing you to really work hard. It's not really fast-paced at all and it is not at all similar to other DVDs, titled ""Fat-burning"". In general, I would only recommend it to someone who is looking for an in-depth Pilates workout, but not particularly a fat-burning one."
4,G1's built-in flash is blocked,Quite a good wide converter lens. It works well with the 58mmlens adapter. Comes with front and back caps and also with afantastic pouch for keeping it in.The only problem with this wide converter is that the built-inflash on my Powershot G1 doesn't reach the right hand side ofthe photograph when the lens is on. This is also the problemwith the light-sensor lamp and the red-eye reduction lamp.Shouldn't be a problem with daylight and outdoor shootingthough.
1,very large for a minor benefit,the small increase of angle is not worth carrying this heavy and cumbersome lens on a small point and shoot camera.I returned it.
4,Right what I needed,"I use it with a S3-IS and is perfect for my kid's birthdays and other events when the subject is a table-wide away. If you use the camera's built in flash, be careful to point your shots a little lower or buy an auxiliary flash like the HF-DC1 because it may make a small oval shadow on the bottom of the shot, that will need to be removed by cropping."
3,Works well except when it doesn't,"I have Windows 98 SE and this works fairly well (I think) except that I can no longer get Windows to shut down cleanly.On the plus side, the support has been good via email and they may resolve the issue yet."
4,antivirus software review,The product is easy to use. I like that the updates are on an hourly basis. The definitions in the database seem to catch most of the viruses. The ones that can't be treated are quarantined and can be sent to the Bitdefender lab via the internet. There have been no conflicts with other software as of yet.
1,Stop working in like 3 days,"A few days after I purchased Bit Defender and installed it, I began to get this error message....""BufferOver-run"" Okay so basically after three days the software stopped working. I contacted the company and they basically attempted to help me but didn't follow thru. I realized that while they were taking their time getting to my issue my computer was at risk and I decided after 3 days of waiting to ask for a refund. I think the product allowed another virus on my computer.....this product is not worth it."
2,Antivirus Software,Have used Bitdefender before but this was for a Windows ME older computer. It said it would work on it but it would freeze computer and do other weird things. Had to uninstall. It only cost $7.00 so wasn't out much. Found a free Antivirus on internet that seems to work great.
2,much delayed shipping,good product so far but shipping didn't happen. Easy to install. I waited a few weeks for the product though it said it had shipped and had to contact Amazon for assistance. Meantime my computer was not protected and caught spyware and a virus with the free protection from my dsl provider used as a tempory standby ;-(
2,System drain and horrible spam filter,"I used Pc-cillin before, which was great, but I heard the new version 2007 was resource intensive - so I decided to go with Bitdefender.Right away, I noticed that it took longer to start up my computer, or to go from the login screen to the desktop. Sometimes, the login screen would freeze.Additionally, the spam filter caught about 10% of spam, whereas pc-cillin caught 90%. And I constantly tinkered with the filtering to improve it - trying to train it by pointing it to spam messages as instructed. It never go better.I then downloaded the trial version of Pc-cillin 2007, and it solved all the problems. I'm going to purchase the full version of Pc-cillin when the trial runs out and throw bitdefender in the trash."
3,The jury is still out on this one........,"I had purchased this product from BitDefender about 1 month ago after purchasing a new laptop. It is easy to use and the price was right as I purchased it with BitDefender's Internet Security v10. So with a discount for purchasing this software together, I felt the price was good. I also did do some comparison shopping on other Anti-Virus software and BitDefender seemed to be a real winner. Personally, I have yet to see it clean any Viruses out of my system. But I set it up to run automatic sweeps and so it may very well be doing it's job effectively without me really knowing. I do occasionally get some really bad viruses while using P2P programs, but so far my other software has been doing the job of mopping up the trash. So for now......the jury is out on BitDefender."
2,Very Disappointed,"After having Norton on my computer for the last three years, I decided to try a more modern AntiVirus Suite. BitDefender came highly recommended in several computer magazines. Most of the suite pretty much does what Norton does, except the AntiSpam plug-in. What a joke! It only lets you filter by the spammers email address. Most people know that spammers change fake email address faster than Clinton picks up women. Why doesn't BitDefender know that? Filtering by email address is next to worthless. I tried contacting their tech support but they refuse to answer. I'll probably be returning it for a more comprehensive AntiVirus suite."
2,Numerous problems with BitDefender,"I installed BitDefender on two of my computers. Or I tried to. It does not support Vista 64-bit yet so I couldn't use it on one of my computers.On Windows XP, I had several problems. It interfered with several of my games causing them to shutdown. Their support did try to help me but never found the cause. I also had several instances where other programs would stop working properly. For example, Outlook stopped sending and receiving mail. After significant troubleshooting, I removed BitDefender and Outlook started working again.I do have some positives to say about BitDefender. It was easy to use (I am knowledgeable about computers). Also, when I requested my money back, they returned it immediately with no questions asked. That is very impressive compared to many companies."
4,Does an excellent job,"So far the BitDefender Version 10 has done an excellent job. In about 3 months of use, no viruses have gotten through. According to the little pop-up windows, it has stopped quite a few bad guys. I have no way of knowing if any of these were false alarms.Complete scans of the system and hard drives take some time - about 45 minutes in my case. The automatic updates performed frequently by BitDefender keep the product updated; however, the computer slows down somewhat while the updating is being done in the background.I have used McAfee and Norton and had problems with both of them - certain other software wouldn't run at all. I don't know if those problems have been eliminated or not.The only real complaint I have is that the interface is not very easy to use - at least for me."
3,Disappointing...,"I'd previously read reviews of this product that raved about its ease of use and ability to catch the bugs. After having used McAfee, Norton and Trend Micro (CA), as well as AVG (freeware) on various computers, I thought I'd give it a go.The product seems to use fewer resources than McAfee and Norton, which seem to hog them, but it also seems to be a bit unstable. After running BitDefender Plus for three months, I've had at least a dozen times where it decides to not work (shuts down the antivirus protection). I've played with the settings and saved them, but only a 'repair' of the software will bring it back. While this is not fatal, it's darned frustrating!To its credit, when it's up and running, it catches virus' and spam. I appreciate that, as it's why I bought it, but I am disappointed to have to do much more than set it and forget it.I'll go with Trend Micro again next time. It seemed to be the least problematic with the smallest resource appetite."
2,crystal wand for pain,this was bought to help me with my pain and so far it has not. i am not happy with it
1,Not a happy camper,This product does what it is intended to do but... It scratches way to easy. Then the more you mess with it the more it gets scratched. It needs to have a more durable clear finish on it like most Lexan motorcycle windshields have so it can be touched and used without showing wear. Not sure how long I'll be able to use this?
4,A Reader,"I bought this reading light a few months ago. I was a little skeptical initially about how well it would work. I have gone through more Itty Bitty lights than I care to admit to (they are poorly designed junk). After some initial time to get used to using this light, I am generally pleased. Its been the only light that hasn't disturbed my wife's sleep when I use it. I just recently ordered the full size version for hardcover and larger softcover books. I have left the protective plastic sheet over the lucite lense and have not experienced any scratching problems. The batteries do last a while and the light will gradually dim, telling you its time for new batteries. This light is worth trying."
1,NOT ACCEPTABLE,"The light on the page looks NOTHING like it does in the photo of the product. The light is very dim and uneven. It's the unevenness that makes the page hard to read. It makes it very difficult to scan your eyes across the page to read more than a couple of words at a time. So if you're reading anything technical, you can't see an entire mathematical equation or a line of computer code all at once.The problem might easily be solved by the company inserting a few more LEDs in the product to fill in the dark spots. But they haven't addressed this for many years and don't seem likely to.I bought a better book light that has a fluorescent bulb. It works beautifully and illuminates the page very evenly so that I can see the whole page at a glance."
2,Disappointment,The plastic scratches extremely easily. The lights throw stips of light across the page instead of lighting the whole page. It is relatively heavy to hold along with the book. Altogether it was very disappointing. Not too bad in bed when it is really dark and there are pillows to support it.
1,also disappointed,"Like others, I was very excited about this product...I purchased it with the magnifying page and couldn't wait to be able to read some of my books again....I was disappointed when I got a book ready to read....light is uneven, wavey and the magnifying page just intensifies the distortion with more waves. The whole thing is distracting because you have to keep it lined up on the page just so and then have to move it and readjust it to the next page...continuity gets lost."
2,Not as useful as I expected it to be. ..,"I found the booklight to be very cumbersome to use, and therefore am unlikely to use it unless I was in a situation where I had no choice but to read in total darkness."
4,Its a cool gadget to have,"It worked just as i expected. I like it and its very useful everytime i travel or read late at night, which i often do. It could be a bit brighter that it is, but still no other problems. Battries also last a long time."
1,Very Disappointed,I wish I had read these reviews before buying this. I wanted something to use with the Kindle and this failed miserably. The light it produces is very dim and has ripples of shadows that makes it nearly unusable. Avoid.
5,Lightwedge is Great!,"I have had and used the lightwedge for about 5 years now and I love it.Being a bibliophile that enjoys reading in bed at night without disturbing my partner this is the perfect Booklight. I have tried every book light on the market and the Lightwedge is far superior to all others.My only regret is I didn't have one of these when I was a kid trying to read at night with a flashlight.The Lightwedge illuminates the entire page at once,not like other lights that have bright and dim spots.Plus ...when you find yourself getting sleepy just close the book on it and it makes the perfect bookmark."
1,Don't Buy this book light,"This is a poorly designed product. As other reviewers have noted, the light is ""wavy"" and thus distracting. Also the light is NOT very bright. Even in a pitch dark room the light is not really bright enough for reading. Turning the pages and re-positioning the light makes for a cumbersome process. Reading is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. LightWedge turns it into a chore. Save your money."
1,PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK-SENT BACK,"The light was supposed to have two intensities and only had one. It also shone causing circular rays of light on the page, which made it very difficult to read. I sent it back to the company, but they still haven't credited my card. One star is too good a rating. I am also out the postage. Not happy."
4,Good reading light for paperback,"I had this book light for over a month and have been using it. It does have problems like other reviewers reported: scratched easily, non-uniform light across the plate (seeing ripple like patterns). There is one spot right between the 2 lights on the side that I found it's not bright enough. Luckily, this usually lands on the margin of a page.Other than those, I like the light. It's bright enough to read comfortably and fit perfectly on a paperback page. For books of larger size, I tried turning it sideway, and scrolled down as I read along. I found it very convenient to keep the light inside the book as a bookmark. I can just close the book, turn off the light, set them aside, and fall right to asleep.I wish there were a third light in the middle along with the 2 lights, that would have fixed the dark spot (and may reduce the ripple patterns?)."
2,Not happy.,I was a dissappointed with the size of the item. I expected it to be the size of a large paperback book....it's not. It's difficult to use the light while reading a magazine or books larger than it is. So now instead of holding the book I'm holding the book and the light which is cumbersome and will probably limit my use of the light.
5,LightWedge Paperback LED Booklight is great,I read a lot of paperbacks during the summer and this has been great. It does not disturb the others in the room and fits on so coveniently. Everyone in my family has one.
1,big wedge light,This wedge light is too large and has no magnification. The light is not that useful.
5,Live & In Studio Jimmy Cliff,"I Love this CD he can get you in a dancing mood wether you want to or not,such good music."
3,Second chance review,"It did start off slow.....and it gets slow from time to time but it is a nice story of courage, secrets and love. A quick read"
4,comfy slippers,"XS is more a 6, very comfy and cute. After wearing from a while it molds into your feet's shape. Has good sole, could be used for running outdoors briefly to get the mail and such. A very nice purchase for under $20 certainly."
3,Great at first...,"I purchased these less than a year ago. They were beautiful, comfy, and warm when I first got them. I had to purchase a new pair (I ended up getting Acorn brand) last week because these are falling apart. If you wear slippers everyday, you may want to consider getting a more durable brand."
5,Woolrich slippers-best I ever owned!,"I ordered these based on other reviews. Came home from work after a grueling day-MY FEET HURT at the end of my nursing shift that day!Found these delivered to my house, put the on (After washing my feet of course,clean feet are essential in slippers!) and FELT 100% BETTER,felt like I was walking on clouds. Plus these are the best fitting slippers ever, they don't slip off your feet. The non slip sole makes them safe on the cellar stairs. I love them so much it's like my feet went to the spa."
3,Gave them away,"Advertised as size 8 or 9, they won't fit if you're a size 9. Also, for better comfort you will want to remove the labels that are sewn inside both slippers right under your heals! Why would they put the labels there? Other than that, they are soft and nicely padded."
3,Basic / no frills / good,"Highly recommended for anyone who wants just a taste of black & white film. I purchased this item as a experiment into the realm of film after years of work with digital. The flavor of prints from film is distinctly different from that of digital, and I would encourage anyone who is very familiar with digital, but not film to purchase a disposable camera just to experiance the difference.If I had one complaint about this item, is that I was unable to toggle the flash to ""off"" once I charged it the first time. Even after letting the camera sit overnight, the flash was still enabled. Perhaps I simply didn't understand the instructions."
2,eeeeekk awful!!!,"I was quite taken by the look of the Camera. Very Compact, Professional looking (almost real) to previous ""Cardboard Box"" Disposable Camera's Kodak have brought out in the late 80's early 90's.When I got the Photos developed they just looked Average, not much Depth in each shot, almost like they were overexposed. Not ""true"" B&W Pics. I've taken many B&W Photos before with a proper Camera using Ilford B & W Film. The Photo's were just so-so. I don't know about this whole Ektanar Lens stuff either, the Photos produced were no clearer than any other One time use Camera. I probably shouldn't expect so much from a Single Use Camera."
1,Please do not buy this camera!,"I bought 6 of these cameras for my wedding. The pictures developed were grainy and awful. Not one shot was usable. We took pictures in the light, the dark, all the shots were terrible. The photo lab told me that the film inside the camera was instructed to be developed using standard colors (?) and there was no way she could have altered the pictures or film to turn out better. I am extrememly disappointed and would never recommend this camera to anyone."
4,The committee approach,"This is a book which, despite being written by a committee and showing it, has a definite point of view. It is somewhat superficial, but contains a fairly good review of the literature on medical error and some definite ideas about what to do. This is the book for policy wonks who are interested both in health care and in government intervention. Those looking for more in-depth treatment of the subject would do well to consider Human Error in Medicine, edited by Marilyn Sue Bogner."
5,A Very Strong Case for Change,"Far from being just another catalogue of avoidable trajedy this well written and well researched volume focuses on what needs to be done. It recommends nothing short of a a wholesale change in the design and structure of the healthcare industry.You will not read this book and feel comfortable with the status quo. You will not read this book and think things can change easilly. You will not read this book and give up hope - it is something like a, ""call to arms"" for all caring and motivated people to act to change things for the better.Try and imagine healthcare delivered like Toyota make cars - zero defects, just in time, team-based problem solving... not silos and secrecy. Bravo to the authors for their courage and insight.You may also enjoy,Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Satisfactionif you enjoy this book."
4,BL18 Cordless Electric Blower,"This is not the most powerful blower on the market, but having this battery operated blower is a GREAT convenience for my weekly mowing chores. It works very well to blow grass clippings off the sidewalk and driveway. The two quick charge batteries offer more than enough energy to get the job done!"
1,Don't buy this piece of junk!!!,"I had a Black and Decker cordless broom(< 50 bucks everywhere) which gave up the ghost after 4 years of nearly weekly use. The Original Power got great reviews, and comes with two batteries, so I decided to purchase it (although it was more expensive). It is very cheaply made (thin-walled plastic), and I'd estimate has about 1/2 the blowing power of the B&D.; Worse yet, the charger failed after 1 week. I went out and purchased another B&D; and will never buy anything manufactured by Original Power (now I know why I'd never heard of them).By the way...the charger carries a warning that touching the power cord will contaminate your hands with lead, so be sure to wash them!!! Are they kidding?"
4,Enjoyable,"Good. I am an experienced photographer, and this was an enjoyable watch. I would liked to have heard a bit more on the technical approach, but I got some good ideads from this."
5,Old fashioned and wonderful,"It's so more agreable to have this engagement calendar on your desk than a modern and dull looking electronic device. Use an old fountain pen to take your notes, and wait till the ink is dry before turning the page! Wonderful pictures under your eyes every day of the year! You can escape and image yourself so far from the busy and noisy modern world. I'm waiting for the 2003 edition."
4,Chased By the Lght: A 90-Day Journey,"I've great respect for this photographer and love his photographs and written testimony on his work and his relationship with his subjects. This book has wonderful photos. That said, many of the photos are pretty small, and my preference is for the image to fill the page, or a large part of it. Still this work is a powerful story about this piece of earth and the creatures (including this author) on it."
5,Amazing restraint-amazing photography,"Being from Minnesota and a lover of nature, the subject matter of this book intrigued me. Having done photography as an advanced amateur most of my life, much of it in the same areas Jim shoots, I am completely awestruck at his ability to capture such a sense of the northwoods with only one frame a day. Besides being a visually stunning work, it gives us ""wannabes"" food for thought. Maybe hunting that perfect frame would help us capture the essence we want, instead of firing off a whole roll of film. Myself, I know that if I ever encounter a wolf in the wild up close, I won't remember this advice but will take a whole roll, but maybe after my first encounter, the next one will show thought, inspired by this book."
5,"Great Book, Great Man, and Great Photographer","Last summer I spent a week with Mr. Brandenburg at one of his seminars. Not only is he a great photographer, but a great man. This book is filled with pictures that only Jim could take, and make so meaningful to so many people. I know this all came as a challenge to himself, and yet it became so much more to so many people. We should all be thankful he chose to share this work with us. We look forward to more Jim."
3,A bit on the light side,"While I like and collect Eagles (pictures, figures, etc.) and knives and this seemed an ideal combination. The knife itself has something of a ""cheap"" feel to it. It is purely an ornamental knife. In general I have been happy with Smith & Wesson knives. This one just doesn't seem to live up to my expectations. I've taken it out of the box a couple of times and just never really enjoyed it. When I say it is light, that applies both to the physical feel of the knife in the hand and the impression that should I attempt to use it for any moderately heavy task where some force is required, the knife may not hold up. As one of my nieces would say ""it looks good""."
2,Marginal book with furniture plans from the 70s,"Drawings are minimal, projects are dated and of questionable usefulness. Poor quality b&w photos, no materials lists. Sorry I wasted the money."
4,"Plenty of projects, from the basic to the complex.",This book offers many projects from the beginner to to expert. Indoor and outdoor projects make this book unique...and it comes fully illustrated with pictures and blueprints!
5,Puerto rican flag,"Flag in great shape, the packaging was great the devilery was very fast and I did not have any problems with the order."
5,Solid design,Solid design and accuracy. Displays well at this size. I recoomend if you want to have a medium to large flag. The material allows for nice movement and holds up well for outdoor aplication.
3,I learned a lot but need to tell you something.....,"This unauthorized biography has quotes and comments from a lot of people that Bill did not like or respect. It is somewhat one-sided in that respect. People either loved or hated him, but a remarkable number of people respected him and appreciated what he did. Having worked with him for 12 years, I am one who respected him greatly. This is just one of the two bios on him and I suggest readers look for the authorized one by Robert Greenfield called BILL GRAHAM PRESENTS."
2,Author Misses Point,"This book is somewhat informative, yet somewhat suspect. The author chooses ex-wives and foes of Bill Graham toprovide ""insight"" or rather sling the dirt in unnecessary ways with pithy comments (""graham would collect loose change off of the floor after a show"")in an effort to highlight graham's reputation as a capatilist. The author cannot relate the smallest anecedote without putting in a jab about the fact that Graham made money. The author seems to have a bone to pick with capatilism and Bill Graham, and rather than write a good read, he takes shots and really does graham a disservice. This book is marginal at best."
1,A Masterpiece!!!,Mr. Glatt is the James Joyce of Biography!!! Has morer talent than Attilla the Hun and Martha Stewart combined.
3,Pretty Pompous,"I bought this book in Dec. and after reading the first 10+ pages, I haven't picked it up since. It really left me cold. It is far from the warm and inviting read of designers who write their own books. Although the pictures are lovely, there is little helpful information. Although I've admired Smith's work in the past, I now feel that he has been respresented as unapproachable and arrogant and he, after all, approved of this representation."
5,Gorgeous,"An important reference source: Michael Smith's work is both handsome and serene, and this book is a very polished presentation of his work, with beautiful visuals and comprehensive text. No significant decorating library would be complete without this."
1,Disappointing!,I was expecting a lot from Michael Smith. Most pictures have already appeared in magazines and the quality of the photos was better than those in this book. Also there is not much in the way of advice. Smith tells you how to buy expensive antiques but not how to use them in the room. Take a close look at the photographs... all of them have huge floral arrangements as the center of interest! Why? Can these rooms not stand on their own without extravagant flowers in vases to attract your attention? I guess not. Save your money and buy a book that has something informative to say and show. What a major disappointment!!
2,NoSubstance,"I picked this book up looking for lots of ideas for the home I have just bought. Maybe Michael Smith does great stuff for the very wealthy, but I can honestly say I did not get one new idea after reading all 208 pages of the book.For the size of the book I was expecting some before and afters and at least a few how-tos.Stick to reading the occasional design magazine and you'll be in much better shape or save your money and get it from the library if you must look at it. Sorry, Amazon. --."
2,Michael Smith Elements of Style,Disappointed in the overall look and content of the book. Would rate it a C+.Hellen
2,"""A lot of money for a book cover""","I bought this book only because of the very rich Tony Douquette-like intior on the cover, fully expecting to see more of the same or similar inside. After all isn't the cover supposed to represent the main ""idea"". It spoke to me in my language, and looked like a room ripped from my own home. A friend of mine saw it and even said it looked like I had designed the room myself. Big mistake. There is nothing in the book that comes close to the richness, depth and beauty of the picture on the cover. It was a big disipointment!"
4,Visual treat,"No, not much instruction. How many instruction books does one need? I've read it once. I've looked at it thoroughly a dozen times. I'm sure I will look at it far more than that in the future. Yes, I have seen some of these photos in magazines. Now I can toss those and keep this forever. I see nothing wrong with the quality of the photos, as other reviewers have mentioned. If someone gave these reviewers a book on Van Gogh that did not have instructions on how to paint, would they toss the book in the trash, or would they keep it to look at the beautful paintings? I do not want any more instruction books on decorating. I want books to show me a mood, a subtle color, how lighting,paintings, or even floral arrangements can make an interior."
5,A light in the darkness,"When I first started playing this game, I made a family of eight people. Two kids. I didn't know about fire alarms or cooking skills. Four people (my men) all died. Then the others wouldn't work because they were too depressed. They spent free time wallowing in self-pity, mourning over the tombstones, and getting stuck behind furniture (and I couldn't figure out how to get them out).I played the game for a year, figuring it out pretty basically, still not able to get past the rusted-up carpool car. I knew things got better for some people because I downloaded families that were rich and happy.That didn't last long - I just plain wasn't good at the game.Then, a light in the darkness, was this book! It was totally awesome! Whatever I needed help with was IN THERE. Now I've got happily married six-people families who are always happy! . Now I only trust maxis-mades, BTW.If you think you're an expert or not, everything really lies in this book."
3,ammenities listed not offered,"While the resort we chose was lovely, the ammenities listed were not offered and never had been according to the owner. Where did they obtain their information? We love to travel with our pet. Why is it impossible to find a book written by people who have actually visited these places and have an honest opinion of them?"
3,Perhaps better in print than in person,"Okay, We stayed at two places last week that were listed. The first, ""Inn at Lake Joseph"" was fine excepting for our reservation was changed from a light second-floor place to an extremely dark first floor room, this after an emailed confirmation for the nicer room (which was over $200 a night). The second place was ""The Harbour Inne and Cottage"" in Mystic. Well, this Inne is on the water but right next to the sewage treatment plant and behind the train tracks. The cottage cost $250 a night and is basically an old Quonset Hut with cedar artfully applied in a hippie manner, but we all had fun anyway. It would be good for the Kathleen and Robert Fish to go wherefore they write. We stand reluctant go anywhere listed in the book without further checking."
2,"Very low quality, unlikely to last long","It became apparent as soon as I took this set out of the box that this is the lowest-end luggage there is. If I saw it at a physical store I wouldn't have even given it a second look. I am giving it two stars only because for $79 for 5 pieces one should not expect much. But paying the list price of $249 for this would be an insult.* Thin fabric is all that separates the inside from the outside, there is no padding, no inner liner.* Zippers are very fragile.* The telescoping handle is exposed inside, not enclosed in its own tunnel as you'd normally see.The handle in the largest suitcase I received was broken - I couldn't get to extend it. Handle on the next suitcase worked but by that time I saw enough to return the whole thing."
1,horrible,"$79 for a 5 piece set sounded good but the quality of this set is very poor. The ""rollerblade"" wheels has no ball bearings. The one I had got stuck and stopped rolling, so I had to drag it around on my trip. The handle feels like it was gonna rip right off. Returning for a refund."
2,Totes luggage is crapola,"The set I bought was $89 but I can't find it on amazon now that it is delivered. The handles are cheap, the extension handles do not lock, the zippers are not smooth and the material is thin. I do not expect these to last very long, but the airport gorillas will ruin whatever you buy. I give 2 stars for the low price.UPDATE!!! Afer 2 trips a wheel broke on the largest piece rendering it useless for air travel. Pay no attention to the positive reviews...do not waste your money unless it is obly for car trips."
4,Wedding gift,This luggage set was a wedding gift to my son and daughter-in-law. They were very pleased with the whole set. It came in very handy when we all traveled to Colorado for their wedding in November. It help up well in all the throwing around it gets in the airlines.
2,"Low quality , but lightweight.",This is an overpriced set of luggage. It is made from material that probably will not last more than 2-3 trips before it breaks. The color could be a little darker too.
1,Weakest link in your RV,"I have had these in two brand new RV's and they have never worked. Not even at first. I return them to be fixed, the techs fiddle with it for awhile and say try this and bring it back if it doesn't work. Next trip. no fridge, return and start over. Eventually I get tired of them trying to fix it. AC electric has always worked. Fine when you're parked at home. Battery sucks dry in hours if you try to use that. Gas just never works. Will not light, will not stay lit. Even more frustrating because the switch is right next to the gas hot water heater. One touch and its on, never any problems so it's not like we can't build something that works. I'm completely through with Norcold."
3,Works but,"Works, but we have had trouble with excessive condensation. We started storing a cloth in the fridge to wring out the water every day when used in the summer"
2,Missing pieces,"Product description for this item specifies:""Hardened steel nozzles (2 included) are threaded for easy replacement""I ordered this product and returned it twice as the original was missing replacement nozzle and the replacement is missing a replacement nozzle.Did not try to use."
1,Don't buy based on Amazon's Description,"This looks like a nice unit, but in Amazon's description, it says it comes with abrasive material. As noted in another's review, IT DOES NOT!!!!!!! Once again, Amazon is wrong in their description, and just plain doesn't care or desire to fix it."
4,For those who are already Doctor Who fans,"Yes, the plot is full of holes, the biggest one being, of course, that cave-men speak and understand English. But for anyone who is a fan of the series, this is a must have, if for the historical record alone. Just to be able to see the first episode of a show that ran for over 20 years. And to be able to see the first doctor, William Hartnell, and get a sense of what the character was originally intended to be is a treat. The doctor as written here is crusty and arrogant, not the cuddly, loveable and occasionally (but amusingly) smug doctor you will know if you've only seen the Tom Baker episodes. Taken on its own merits, without the historical significance, this would rate only 2 stars. It's definitely not for the first time Doctor Who viewer, at least not if you want to know why this show is such a cult classic. But it did make me want to own more Hartnell episodes and to fill in the holes in my Doctor Who viewing experience."
2,Children everywhere learn to hide behind settees...,"This episode would get one star from me, simply for starting the whole darn Doctor Who franchise in the first place, but gets another star for the fact that it probably produced a better fight-scene amongst those cavemen in '63 than anything 'Who would ever subsequently see. This episode also presaged the cheap special effects of future years with the BBC's effects budget being saved a bundle due to the chameleon circuit on the Tardis ever so conveniently ""breaking"" leaving the good old blue Police box to be recycled for all future episodes. Uh huh.Oh, and if this took place today, with a (supposedly) teenaged girl living in a junkyard with her eccentric ""Grandfather,"" Ian and Barbara would be dialling 999 on their mobiles, and a very different story it would have been indeed...- M. Grade, professional Who-hater Esq."
2,Filled with mistakes; nice photos!,"This book is loaded with mistakes! Some are not even close to being accurate! Has some nice photos though, but not worth the money!"
3,Its all about Edison,"The book had some interesting ideas; however, the way he proves or shows these ideas comes off as an advertisment for a company called Edison. Edison is a private contractor which works with schools in order to bring a district's student performance to current standards. Through out the book, his company is mentioned numerous times which ultimatly leads to a distraction of what he is trying to convey.The start of the book is excellent, explaining the current education crisis we face. The figures, and comparissons made me truly think this book was going somewhere, until I read up to the middle where the book became slugish. His ideas of Reasearch and Development in education were very strong and well supported. This is the one idea that I clinched on to, the other ideas were loss in the talk about how Edison school was implementing them. Overall, the book started out with a great start, (and I give stars for the first few chapters) and went down hill from there."
3,A good book but....,I have read a few other books regarding education in the US and all 7 of the reviews for this book. I basically agree with most of the other comments and don't feel I need to repeat them. The book does provide another approach to help fix the public school systems in the US by using private companies to manage the districts. This has taken place primarily in Philadelphia by a company called Edison and Chris provides a lot of details about this process. I don't why this process couldn't be taught to the existing administration?Also I would like to see is statistics regarding how these Edison run schools are doing versus schools in better districts and/or private institutions. All of his data depicts the measured improvment in inner city schools that have no where to go but up...All in all this is still a very informative book that I recommend buying.
3,Best pinball sim ever made - not very XP friendly though!,"The Pro Pinball games are the best you can get without having a full-sized table in your game room (which we do).I loved these games when they were first released, and played them on Win95 and 98, but when XP came along, they were toast.I was very happy to see that they had been re-released for XP.Strangely, the first two games work just fine, but the newest in the series will not work on my computer. It installs, graphics are fine, but all keyboard entries are erratic and slow (I'm talking 10-20 seconds for response times!). The fix posted in the readme files, and the updates, didn't fix the problem for me, but may fix it for others.It's a bummer, because the third game is my favorite - however, I'll live with just the other two.It's still worthy - but frustrating to pay for something and not be able to play part of it!"
3,To Bury Your Poop!,Every camper needs a small trowel with which to bury their poop. This one works fine for that but is priced way out of line. Buy the $4.95 version with the nylon cover instead; I did and I'm very happy with it. Folding Garden Trowel Measures 5-3/4' x 2-1/8' and Includes a Black Canvas Belt Carrier
1,Seekers Silent,"The dvd plays on certain players only:it is not a Bluray but something else , so sadly, it didnt play,"
2,UGH!!! Maybe I should read better,"It's not really the products fault that it got only two stars from me. My question is ""What stove has (3)6"" burners and (1)8"" burner?"" Now I still don't have a complete matching set for my stove. I ackowledge that this is my own fault for not reading more carefully or simply looking at the picture but the ""set"" really makes no sense at all."
5,A must-have,"I briefly saw the video for ""Take A Message"" back in the summer of 2002, and immediately needed to find out more about the artist behind the song. Remy Shand's album is an absolute must-have. There are very few albums that you can listen to from start to finish, and ""The Way I Feel"" belongs in that category. Every song is better than the one that preceeded it. ""Rocksteady"", ""The Way I Feel"", ""Looking Back On Vanity"", are among my favourites from this album.It's a great chill-out CD, and is reminiscent of the old Motown sound. Remy Shand is an extremely talented musician, and I hope he hurries back to the studio to come out with a follow-up! If you like Jamiroquai, Alicia Keys, Maxwell, D'Angelo, et. al., you are sure to enjoy Remy Shand."
4,Want to hear more from him,"I liked this new artist's work. When I read the back cover to see who else was on the album and found out he had performed all of the needed sound, I was flabergasted. What a great talent to have written the songs, played the instruments, and sing. The tunes had there own twist that could only be described as a combination of Bee Gees, Marvin Gaye, R&B and soft rock. There were only a couple songs I did not really care for. I recommend this album for anyone that likes to be able to put on a CD and listen to the whole thing without having to keep forwarding to the next track to hear a good beat. I hope he puts out another album equal to it. Love to hear more from him."
4,Nice smooth R&B groove,"Remy has a nice flow goin with this CD, his sound is old school R&B much like my mom once listened. He has a vocal range like Maxwell and I definately felt that old Motown vibe on many of the tracks. Given the fact I bought the CD after hearing only one song I am more than pleased and it rarely leaves my car. In fact I recommeded Remy to my mom and it rarely leaves her car now! Waiting for Remy to tour some local clubs now!"
4,Not bad for a white guy,"I have to second the amazon editorial review here -- this is pretty funky for canadian whiteboy neo-soul, but once in a while remy sounds a little anemic. He does great arrangements, and has really singable melodies. Personally, I'd take a few more upbeat/uptempo tracks, but overall this is a really enjoyable disc. Looking forward to his next release."
4,White Voice... Black Soul,"At last a surprise! A new white soul performer-composer-player is born. No sample, No interpolation , only new songs. Simple sound that goes directly to our soul. For those who loves Marvin Gaye, Maxwell, D'Angelo this is a must-have record. I love it."
4,"Really 4.5 stars, but that's not possible on here","My cousin introduced me to this album by saying ""He's not as good as Thicke, but he's still nice."" I agree completely. Very good album. In fact, I recommend this one and ""A Beautiful World"" by Thicke. I appreciate the white boys coming with solid neo-soul, funk type music. Keep it up fellas!"
4,Remys okay,"I fell for Rock Steady, however it was the remix of Rock Steady that I first heard, I was a little disppointed because this track was the main reasons for buying this CD. The remaining tracks are okay."
3,NOT convincing.,"I agree with the Amazon house reviewer that Shand givesthe old Manitoba try, but he sounds exactly like someanonymous Canadian trying to give his best rendition of R&B.;The title track ,Take A Message and the Second One havepossibilities ..."
2,somewhere between Jamiroquai&Maxwell,"just heard this Album.and after watching the Video I was curious about Remy.I give Props to MusicianShip so that is the Main Stars there.but after that not much else for me. fairly Average Material overall&Vocally He is not much on par with Maxwell&Jamiroquai.sounding like a bit of both but not quite getting beyond there Vibe.in all Honesty thus Far Remy Shand is at Best a 2nd tier take on Boz Scaggs hopefully in time He will have a Jam like ""Low Down""and even more importantly a Album along the lines of ""Silk Degrees"".time will tell."
4,A total sleeper...........so wake up!,"First-thing-first.......take the CD, look at the front cover turn it sideways and read the message: ""written, produced, arranged, performed, and mixed by remy shand""....... that in itself should give this canadian his props for such a dynamic CD. I personally think ALL OF YOU are taken the term NEO to an extreme when it comes to new artist who aren't R&B. Hey....this is a great soul album.......PERIOD. Label it how ever you want, Remy put his soul into this. I honestly couldn't compare this to anyone from the past 10 years of soul music. Remy took this back to the era of good soulful, meaningful music and I just gotta give it to'em for that. Put him in with Lewis Taylor from the UK, another white soul artist I'm really diggin.Favorite gems: ""the way I feel"", ""take a message"", ""the mind's eye"", ""liberate"", ""burning bridges"" and ""the 2nd one""standout gem: ""rocksteady""oNe"
4,Stuck in my CD player,"I've had this CD for about a week or two and it's my current favorite. I could listen to this CD the whole way through a couple times a day. Its makes me want to sit back, chill, and listen on some good surround sound. I'm not a R&B expert, but in his songs Remy Shand covers some ground in the R&B area...from rock to smooth and in between. This guy has some serious talent considering he did most or all of the production of this album. I didn't give it five stars because I don't think it will be a classic of all time in the area of music, but it sure will be a classic in my collection.Favorites are:""Way I Feel"", ""Take A Message"", ""Rocksteady"", ""Liberate"", ""I Met Your Mercy"", ""The Mind's Eye"".In these days of downloading music, there are very few CDs that I will buy from the stores. But I'd have to say that I made an exception for Remy Shand."
4,BOOCHIBOY,the white boy is baaad!Marvin Gaye & Maxwell the old style soul of Motown has been tapped by newcomer Remy Shand.Soul to fill your soul!You go boy!
4,Nice Remy...Very Nice,"Actually, I give this album 4 and 1/2 stars.Thanks for someone finally having the guts and the creativity to actually put some real music on a recording. This guy knows what he's doing, and he shows it in every song; especially with the organ and the rhodes and the groovin bass lines. There are only about two or three tracks that could have used a little more work, but his worst songs are still very good compared to many of these ""so-called"" r&b artists of today. This guy is a true musician and has that smooth sound that an r&b artist should have. After all, if it isn't smooth, then it isn't really r&b. Songs on the album such as ""Looking Back on Vanity"" and ""Burning Bridges"" are incredible and just make you wanna see this cat in concert. I'm telling you, this is some great stuff, go out and get this one, it is well worth it."
4,I'll be...!!!,"This silky smooth new wonder is off the hook. I mean come on his video for ""Take a message"" was intriguing. So when his cd dropped I ran NOT walked to get my copy. This cat not only sings lead and background vocals, but he also plays all the instruments, produced and engineered all the tracks!!! I was blown away by his delicious delivery and I like the fact that he actually has something to say. I hate to compare him to past artist, but I hear Marvin Gaye all over this gem, which is cool, because who doesn't love Marvin? I wish Remy all the best! And would like to thank him for his vision. Pick this one up ya'll. Peace"
5,Remy Lays It On the Line...,"...or ""Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe""What more praise can I heap on this talented Motown neo-soul artist that already hasn't been said by the 90 some other reviewers here? Actually, nothin'. But if you have not heard this man's other cuts--like ""Burnin' Bridges"" and ""Everlasting""--then, you're 'really, really' missing quite a treat. ""Rock Steady""? You know I likes that. He'll have you asking that musical question: ""Rapheal, who...?"""
4,Fantastic sound,"This collection, especially ""Rock Steady,"" sounds just like the music I was listening to back in the 70's when I was rebelling against disco. There was some superb yet less popular music being produced back then and Remy Shand appears to have revived that niche. I can't wait for his next work to come out."
4,Another Soul Smash from Motown's Massenburg,"The rim of the packaging for this CD proclaims ""written, produced, arranged and mixed by Remy Shand"". Having read that, one is led to wonder just who is Remy Shand. Either this guy has a big ego or he is all that. Fortunately, in this extremely rare case, the latter is true.Kedar Massenburg, current CEO of Universal's Motown unit has scored again with his latest found talent. Much to my surprise, Remy Shand is of the caucasian persuasion. Neo classic soul with heavy emphasis on instrumentation and lyrical content is his music style. Fans of India Arie, Erykah Badu and D'Angelo will happily enjoy this loaded acoustic soul music project."
4,"Y'think he ""channeled"" Marvin Gaye?","From the opening strains of the title cut, the listener feels as though Shand is Gaye reincarnated. The singer expresses himself in a style similar to that music legend; like Gaye, Shand volleys effortlessly from a soothing tenor to a sultry falsetto.The instrumentation is as retro as contemporary pop/soul can be. This is one album that should appeal to a wide audience with its diversity.What is it about Canada? They produce some genuinely soulful and singular artists that take the world by storm.'Must be the water."
4,"An impressive, soulful, polished debut record","True R & B performers are still hard to come by, neo-soul movement notwithstanding. That's why I have really enjoyed Remy Shand's debut release, ""Way I Feel."" Shand, who exhibits a range of musical talents, has crafted a solid debut that happens to be one of the more soulful records I've heard in a while. ""Way I Feel"" is enjoyable from beginning to end. I particularly enjoyed the bounce of the title track, as well as the singles, ""Rock Steady"" and ""Take a Message."" Remy's sound is more Stax than Motown, but he is a legit R & B star whose best work, I think, is yet to come. This is one of the best LP's of 2002.P.S.: As much as I love Jamiroquai and its Space Cowboy of a lead singer, comparisons between Remy and the J are inaccurate."
5,A VERY IMPRESSIVE DEBUT,"I first discovered Remy Shand back in February of this year an hour before the Grammys.I had lazily flicked over to the Canadian music video station MuchMusicand saw the video for ""Take A Message""(his debut single) and was SMITTEN!!Very seventies yet modern.I was loving this song!...From that very impressive first showing,I was determined to buy this young,new artist's debut album.Well,I did.That was a very good choice on my part!! ""The Way I Feel"" is an all-around winner! From the luxurious title track to the wistful ""Burning Bridges"" to ""Liberate"",the Prince-like ""I Met Your Mercy""...the whole thing is HOT!As the side of the CD proudly indicates,Remy(whose from Canada by the way)wrote,produced,arranged,played,and mixed the entire album.That alone deserves a hand...Like [others],""The Way I Feel"" and Shand,both have a soulful,retro-yet-modern,emotional feel that you FEEL..."
5,Smooth Jazzy Soul,"If you are into smooth laid back soul, this CD is the one! From the very first track, I was captivated. This guy is definitely hot!! He sounds like a cross between Prince and Maxwell, but with his own style.This blue-eyed soul brother is a keeper! He will go far, I guarantee it!!"
5,Move over Boz,"When I first saw the video I thought to myself that this would be just another white boy with the blue eyed soul thing. I was wrong. On the strenght of one song, Take a Message, I changed my thinking! This is the heir apparent to Boz Scaggs kingdom! Plus he can play his own instruments. Go Remy Go. Here's to being color blind!"
3,equal parts maxwell and jamiroquai,"ok, as an album, this is good. as a neo-soul album, it's middle of the road. definitely listenable. you won't be saying ""i paid ...for this ...?!!!"" but it probably won't be stuck to your CD player.remy shand's voice is half-maxwell and half-jay kay (of jamiroquai). not much range, but it's a pretty sexy falsetto at sometimes, and a tender growl at others.the production is also not as refined as it could be. the sound quality isn't quite as clear or full as you'd expect from a CD.remy shand is undeniably talented, and this isn't one of those regrettable CD purchases. but if i had to do it over, i'd buy something else."
1,Don't understand what all the fuss is about!!,"I purchased this CD after seeing the last half of the video-Take a message. I thought I would give it a try. Remy Shand is a talented musician. I do not disagree with that statement. But his voice is not strong enough to carry the notes on the album.The lyrics are mediocre and do not set him apart from other artists out today. He sounds like he went out and purchased someCurtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye albums then decided to see what he could do. After a couple of songs, all the others songs got maybe a minute of play(that may be being generous) before I would skip to the next song.Bottom line-I was not feelin it."
1,One of the worst That I have ever bought,"All Of the material here has been done before by much better singers. There is nothing ""Neo"" or new about it. He tries so hard to be soulful that it comes across as funny. His falsetto is foul. Hint: If you want to hear good soul music, listen to Marvin Gaye, Al Green, The Isley Brothers, Barry White and Prince, not some talentless imitator. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option."
1,Drip pans,The large drip pans simply did not fit my stove. They were too big. So I sent them back. I guess I'm not going to be able to find any that fit that model since I've tried several different ones to no avail.
1,Don't buy this book.,This book is hopelessly outdated. The author says he won his first prize in 1917. It is really a survey of sweepstakes winners - but from what year I wonder. It feels like it was written in 1970. There is no reference to online sweepstakes at all. It is written in a difficult to read style. I got more and better information doing a web search for sweepstakes hints.
2,Don't try to take this jogging!,"Despite this product's name and claims, it SKIPS. It skips even during light jogging, even when snuggly housed in a waist pack or in a pocket of a jogging stroller. I would not recommend this product to anyone who want to listen to a CD while jogging or running. Big dissapointment. Also it does not come with a belt clip - you have to buy one separately from their 800#."
1,Not worth the postage,This thing broke on me within a month of purchase. The CD started to rotate in reverse and stuck there I was unable to get it to work again. Even before it broke the quality was sub par.
5,Exactly what i needed,yet to make it skipreads anythingnot my first cd player.....but the best by far
5,Old Reliable,"Guys, forget all of the new-fangled iPod or Sony Walkman devices out. Just buy this. Why? It's perfect. Provides a rich sound (coupled with my Philips SBC-HS386 headphones) and it NEVER SKIPS. The reviewer below me might have got a defect, or has the ESP (Electronic Skip Protection) off. I tell, you, I nicknamed mine Old Reliable. No problem with it, it looks cool, allowing you to see the CD as it spins. I've been through many, and I mean many, CDs with this thing. I love you Old Reliable.Up Side: CD player sent down from Jesus himself to allow us to listen to music in its purest form.Down Side: Sheer greatness of this CD player may cause heads to explode upon being touched. You've been forewarned."
5,Best. Player. Ever.,"I've had this CD player for over four years now and it still works beautifully. Very reliable. Gave it a good jolt once and even dropped it, but everything snapped back into place and it kept on running. This is built to last."
2,Just Spend an Extra 10 bucks On the Mp3/Disc,"My experience with this discman lasted me a pretty long time, before it just wouldn't recognize any disc at all. But don't worry, that was about 3 years after i got it. It plays good, the menus are exceptional, but i am wondering why anyone would want this, when you can get the Mp3 / disc player from Philips for twenty dollars more. They are 20 times more high-tech, the menus actually give you the titles of song names (at least most of them) and they truly are jogproof. This is barely jogproof. It only has 45 second shock proof while the new mp3 disc player i got has unlimited. Trust me, you'll be happier if you left this one alone"
3,good...at first,"this was a wounderful product for me, mainley because i had a ten year old RCA untill a little over a year ago. this thing was wonderful, but now it just stops and it also skips. it may have been because i droped it about a foot and a half on some carpet. but if you dont drop it you wont be disapointed."
1,Made of glass,"After having a Sony CD player that lasted through almost three years of torture and still works decently, I bought this one and retired my old Sony. I need a CD player to be survivable because I take my music everywhere, mountain biking, to the gym, in the car. I bought this thinking it could stand up to the same torture that my old Sony did. I was wrong. This thing konked out after having it for two months. One day it just stopped working. The sound quality was ok, but I hated the interface. The buttons are flat so you can't listen to music in the dark. I needed to turn the light on whenever I wanted to hear a certain song before I went to bed. This thing is a good low price but it wont last you very long. Go with a Sony, they are the best!!"
3,Wonderful series but not so wonderful DVD!,"I'm giving this item only three stars because while the show deserves 5 stars (I'll confess I've only seen the first season) this DVD release only deserves one! In the UK and Australia the three seasons of Survivors were put on 11 single sided DVD's. Someone at BBC Video had the bright idea that for the USA release the series would be put on only six. Five of the discs are double-sided, the last one has a single side. This wonderful series, created by Terry Nation the man who created the Daleks for Doctor Who and the series Blakes 7, deserves to be put on discs that are not so fragile and easily scratched. Maybe BBC Video just wanted to make a quick buck off the fans of the new Survivors which is getting a lot of promotion on BBC America. That show is good but not as good as the original. Anyways, Survivors is excellent and should not be missed but this DVD release is a big disappointment."
3,"Half a game, not bad.","The single user game is way too short, I have not seen a large number of game editsd out there to create original fan content, the online community is a little anemic, and the online multiplayer tends to have 'issues'.All that being said the game is fun and inventive, the interface is instantly familiar and intuative. the graphics are really nice. Gameplay is fun, but too short."
3,"Good Game, tweaking","Well, definately worth the money. The only problem I've had is the game has a known issue with ATI graphics cards (which took an hour or something to see what was wrong with it and about 5 min to fix). The text was only half there, like it was cut off from the top. The graphics were psycadelic and actually kinda cool, but annoying after the first couple minutes.I was able to get the game to work fine after some tweaking, but it was a pain to figure out what was wrong with it. There's plenty of online guides on how to adjust your settings because apparently lots of people have had this problem as well. Overall good game, lots of fun. Definately worth the buy, but if you have an ATI card there might be some issues before you can fully enjoy the game."
4,Great RTS with LOTS of action.,"True to the Warhammer 40K universe, this game puts you right in the middle of a war on the planet Tartarus for the souls of every man and woman on the planet. The forces of Chaos have hatched a diabolical scheme to free a foul daemon from its prison and cast its evil shadow on the universe. The Space Marins, Blood Ravens unit, must battle to stop them. Fight a WAAGHG! army of Orks as well as the crafty Eldar as you unfold the great story of those oh to short RTS. A must play."
1,I don't understand the high ratings,"I know that I'm a bit older, and somewhat new to gaming, but this was not at all what I thought it would be. I got it loaded just fine, ran through the tutorial, and began. How dull. I couldn't see enough of the field to make things happen, and I grew very tired of the lame responses when I gave an order. I did learn what I didn't like, and won't be ordering any other games like this in the future. Experience is a great teacher."
3,"Warcraft, but different","I am a long time fan of the WH40k world, and the game faithfully re-creates the art and atmosphere of the original tabletop game. The game play itself is almost exactly like warcraft, with a few twists and turns that make it better. Probably the best improvement is that you can click on any squad member, and the entire squad will be selected, making it much easier to move large numbers of units around at a time.I haven't tried the online mode, but that's because I am a high school graduate (and then some) and am assuming that some enterprising 13 year old will trounce me in under 30 seconds. I didn't find the game compelling enough to invest the effort to get good at it. The single player missions are easy enough that you can get through them even if you aren't that great at the game. Which is a good thing if you're like me and you're just looking to have some fun."
5,In his glorious name!!!,"Dawn of War is a must have pc game for Games Workshop enthusiasts.The graphics are very good for an RTS. The battle animations are completly brutal and a joy to behold. The animations are so cool that you may find yourself saving game films and watching them just to admire the carnage without trying to manage a hectic battle. It's true that the campaign is short, however the skirmishes supply an endless amount of gameplay. You most definetly get your money's worth here. The voice acting is top notch and really serves to add drama to the battles. Each race is unique and potentially devastating. So pick this one up and get ready to wage the war!"
2,Pretty Good But,"It was in very good condition, but the only problem was that there was a broken piece on the inside. If I hadn't noticed it and somewhat fixed it, it may have ruined the tape."
2,Everything you've heard is true...,"...it really isn't very good. Believe it or not, I'm actually a huge fan of season 22. But ""Timelash"" sticks out like nothing else. It's mostly the plot which is at fault - to be blunt, it's very weak, filled with dull action being extended beyond any sense of proper pacing. There might just be enough story to fill one 45 minute episode, but with two it's simply a sleep-inducer. Things are not helped by the faceless characters and the bad acting on the part of everyone save Colin Baker and perhaps Nicola Bryant and Paul Darrow. And let's not forget the substandard (and for DW no less!) production values either - I suppose from some standpoints they are amusing enough to keep the viewer awake. On the plus side, it's not very hard to understand. But I would definitely recommend any of the other season 22 stories on tape or DVD first, especially ""Vengenace on Varos"" or ""Revelation of the Daleks."""
4,Why do I like this one?,"my big sister says that there are four kinds of movies in the world; ones that are fun, ones that are intellectual, ones that are both, and ones that are neither. Timelash belongs to the first category. It stars the worst doctor, the worst companion, and is full of plot holes. But I still think it's fun. I've always liked the rebels versus evil dictator arrangement, and there's some funny bits of dialog. Stupid special effects have never bothered me. I kind of like them, because it's like the directors and producers are saying ""hey, I've got a cheap budget and a fun story, and I think you have enough imagination to enjoy the story no matter how cheap the sets are."" Besides, it's sci-fi. Maybe time corridors really do need tinsel in order to work properly. You never know."
2,Timelash- With a whip baby -crack- that whip!,"I wish i could literally give this movie, or more direct the creators of this episode a legion of lashes. I shouldn't be all too harsh though. The episode does have its entertaining moments. If your thinking about purchasing this episode i won't give too much away. Colin Baker does a good job considering the circumstances and there is an interesting cameo of HG Wells. That was one of the few highlights of the flic. If your a die hard fan of The Doc, a pure bred Whovian, and or a true timelord, you'll find that this episode will entertain you. A non-enthusiast of DW probably wont appreciate it very much.-Sir Josh"
3,an OK epidsode,This is an Ok epidsode with the 6th Doctor and Peri. Peri was good The Doctor had some good lines here and there. But the acting from some of the actors was well....bad. Only get this one if you are going to get the whole season.
2,One of the worst episodes of the Colin Baker Era!,"This episode is one of the worst episode of Colin Baker's era! The time lash is full of tinsel, the androids are dumb, the borad is a lame bad guy! The costumes are OK , but for the aliens and the dinosaurs on the planet itself! One thing that good is they brought aboard H.G Wells for an adventure with the Doctor! Other that is this a very easy episode to forget in the series! Buy this if you need to have every video of the series or of Colin Baker! For fans of the series ""Blake's 7"" Paul Darrow guest stars as Tekker (the Borad's henchman)!"
3,Not as bad as everybody thinks,This story has been smashed to bits by fans however I enjoyed it. The effects are decent but that does not make up for the weak plot. Still a decent video! END
5,Great Ensemble Piece,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was as if I were watching a long lost TV episode of DS9 itself. Often that's not the case with the novelisation of a TV show, however here the characters and their interactions are true to the way they are seen on screen, and the dialogue is believable, including the language they each use. The story is tightly plotted and well thought out, and the authors don't skimp on descriptive passages just because the readers already know and love the show. It was great to see a story line including non-humanoid aliens too, and they were so well written that you could really feel for the poor Horta. An excellent read, one of the best TV-tie-in books I think I know."
3,"Nice muffler, but expected deeper note.","Muffler came on time and well packaged, however, I expected it to have a deeper note. it seems to favor midrange notes, which even on a large 6 cylinder inline, don't sound very well....throathy. Maybe sounds better on a V-8, but it sure does not help a 6 inline sound much more muscular."
4,A few too many...,"A few too many characters with not enough time per episode to develop them.It can be hard to filter out the connections between characters, and a little hard to follow the dialogue with the heavy accents."
4,Contemporary approach to the who done it crime.,"I find myself irritated with Vera's personality at times, but realize that she is a very real person and she shows change andgrowth unlike many too perfect characters. I give the show a 4 only because sometimes the story tends to drag too much attimes."
4,takes awhile,"Good series. It took awhile to get used to the Vera style. The first episode does not explain a lot about the characters, and leaves a lot to be desired. I continued to watch and no feel that the later episodes are much better."
2,Far-fetched and over-wrought,"I wanted to like this series as I am a big fan of many British Mystery series. The atmosphere is solid and some of the supporting cast interesting, but I found the stories to be far -fetched, the camera work to be annoying and, above all, Brenda Blethyn to be over wrought and annoying beyond endurance. Why does she have to constantly adopt histrionics in order to create her character? All that wringing of her hair and rubbing of her face? Far too over the top for my liking. After three episodes I had to give up."
3,"Has potential, but doesn't quite cut it.","I don't know if it is because we were engrossed in the Downton Abbey series before we watched this or what. But this series just did not inspire us to continue watching it. Vera as a detective is a likeable character. But the filming was too quick for us to follow the plot well. And then the motives for the murders seemed rather far fetched. For avid fans of murder mysteries it might do, but if one just likes a good show, I don't think it cuts it."
5,Loved it!!!!!,I have found a new favorite British detective! Ranks up there with Inspector Lewis and Lynley. Can't wait for season 3.
4,Great choice,Brenda Blethyn is really great in this show and the atmosphere really adds to the mysterious feel of the show.
3,Why do people buy an iPod?,"Ian McDonald obviously has a connection with iRiver and wants it to succeed at the expense of iPod. Do you work for iRiver, Ian?"
2,Why would anybody buy this $500? Radio? Cheap JUNK,"Buyer beware, the only thing that seems to work well on this is the RADIO. That's a nice add on but come on, is a radio worth $500?! And even that still suffers from muffled sound quality. Battery craps out after only 8-9 hours - I know that is not a bad life but it is only half what they advertize. Navigation is a pain and the hard drive and transfer is lots slower than even older ipods from 2002 . Maybe I'm wrong but a lot of the five star reviews here sound like they have 'Iriver staff' written all over them. I personally don't see why anybody would buy this junk, let alone rate it over 2 stars."
3,Good Player 3.5 Stars,"I have own my unit for about 5 months and it'sbeen pretty reliable. I like to record my oldminidiscs onto it and with in-line recordingfeatures that's possible. I like the black design,the sound quality is pretty good, and battery lifeis good. I have not gotten 12-16 hours of playbackon a charge yet but I'm always playing this in shufflemode so I imagine that may use more power faster as theunit does do alot of spinning. I really like the remote. I'm not happy with the lack of firmware updates. These units need to have an option to create playlists on the fly."
4,This thing rocks!,"I have no experience with the iPod, but I can't see it being much better than my iHP 140. I've had it for only a day, but I'm in love already.Pros-Easy to navigate (dont believe the hype!) After a quick thumb through the book i've already learned all the crucial functions.-FM Tuner (I dont really use it, but it's a plus)-Ability to use winamp playlists.-100$ cheaper than 40gb iPod.-Great sound, even with the stock earbuds.. Can't wait for my Sonys!-The A-B repeat is cool for a sound editor like myself.-A buncha other things I haven't even discovered yet!Cons-Nasty brown carrying case (it does look like an old sandal)-It would be nice if songs cross-faded into each other.Buy this thing. You wont be sorry."
2,bad bad sound quality,"i just bought mine and regret every penny i spent! The only thing that keep this mp3 player respectable is its features. lots of it. but at the end of the day, if the sound quality would live up to the expectation , then all is worthless.I have compared the sound quality for ihp140 vs. my thinkpad laptop using sony earphone (6-320000hz frequency response). my laptop sounds much better than ihp140, the sound is richer and crispier.when i plug the ihp140 to my car, 03 nissan pathfinder LE factory premium sound, it just sounded like crap. really really bad! i have tried different biterate ranging from 128 - 320(upper limit). but that didn't make too much of a difference. there's no comparison to CD quality sound. so.... i'm very disappointed and going to return itoh yeah, and the LINE - IN has a LOT of noise. when i try to record CD from my DVD player using MP3/320Kbs setting, TONS of noise!!! i just can't stand it anymore!!!"
2,"Not Bad, But Not iPOD","I borrowed one of these for a week and was hoping it woulld be a little better than this for the price, especially as this is a company from Korea. But the navigation was quite difficult and it seemed a bit slow for a hard drive device. It also doesn't recognize Windows files. While the battery life was quite good it still seems more like an iPOD imitation - without the easy navigation - than a device which will break its own new ground. Combine this with sound quality that is average at best and it's safe to say I'll stick with Apple for the next while. You just can't beat that scroll wheel. I'd suggest iRiver (imitation even of the iPOD name?) stick with what it does best, flash memory machines."
2,Does it play by track order?,"Does anyone know how to play albums by track order? So far, it just does them alphabetically, which I don't want."
4,more like 4 1/2,"Not much to add to what other people have said. Except... The Brown Sandal case has changed (is now black), IMO the case could use some tweaks, but that is petty. Operation is pretty smooth. For the price, capacity, and overall merit this is the best thing around. You may not score cool points for not having an ipod, but the extra $100 in your pocket is cool enough for me. I actually prefer it being slightly bigger (case wise) and think it looks pretty snazzy."
4,This thing is great!!!,"I have had the iRiver for 2 months now and I have been very impressed with it.Pros:1. Good battery life. I had the Archos before this.2. The remote control is good.3. Good sound quality. The presets are good.Cons:1. Menu is too easy to pull up...maybe too easy sometimes all U want to do is advance a song and you accidently enter the menu.2. The case only fits a belt loop. A optional clip would have been nicer.Overall a VERY positive experience. I was shoveling snow with this device for hours without a problem. I commute for 2 hours each way, 5 days a week and usually battery life is for 3 days. It's a great device. Worth the extra money.PS. The FM radio was"
1,Disappointed with this Very Hard to Use MP3 Player,After using a 20 MB RIO that died on me (hard disk failure after 5 months) I decided to purhase the iRiver iHO140 becuase the hardware sounded top notch. While I agree that this is a very solid player it's been quite difficult and very frustrating.I have not been able to get Playlists to work and I've also noticed that none of the On Line songs I purchase will work on this unit. When I sent an e-mail to tech support asking if the iHP-140 will sync with Windows Media Player They took 1 week to return an answer and they said this player doesn't currently Sync and they don't forsee it working this way anytime in the future. So basically if you buy music on line DON'T purhcase this player. I should have bought an IPod.
3,iRiver does not support Windows Media DRM,iriver HARD DRIVE PLAYERS do not support WINDOWS MEDIA DRMso all the songs i payed for on line WILL NOT PLAY WITH THISIHP140. TECH SUPPORT SAID NOT TO LOOK FOR IT IN THE NEAR FUTUREMAYBE NEXT YEAR.
2,Sorry Seattle..,"I was disappointed with this purchase. ""Vaxxine"" got me excited for this disc, but sadly, the remaining songs don't compare to the fire of the lead track. Mid-way through the CD I find myself very bored by the uninspired chugga-chugga guitar riffs. On the brighter side, the vocal harmonies are a plus."
2,Nothing new....,"I decided to listen to this cd because David Fricke of ""Rolling Stone"" suggested it. I have to say I was kinda disappointed. I mean, this isn't a bad cd, but it's nothing that hasn't been done before. Rachael Flotard's vocals are kinda dull. The music is decent, but reminiscent of most pop-punk music that's out there. Stick to the Ramones. Or, listen to the Muffs is you want female vocals."
5,Excellent book,"Shows simple maps of explorers routes into North America. Colorful illustrations, brief but meaningful texts, realistic descriptions of the way natives were treated by various groups that came to conquer. Overall, is great for even 7yos!"
5,Not as sad as being a trekkie but...,"Being a Drawfer is something I can be proud of. I watched 'The End' away back (in another life it seems now) when it was first broadcast on the BBC. I own every single video. It has to be good. If you dont fancy getting every single episode on tape right away. The get this one so you know where it all begins the search out Backwards, one of the funniest half hours of your life. And (once the budget had improved) the slightly more lavishly produced Gunmen of the apocalypse.After seeing that lot the phrase ""Its only money"" will become very popular here in Amazon and before you know what hit you youll have 52 hilarious episodes of some of the funniest british TV ever to be released since Fawlty Towers."
5,funny,"Red Dwarf is a perfect example of british humor at it's best. Clever writing, hilarious characters, and great plots make it one of the best TV shows on earth."
5,Closest to the real thing...,"The problem I always had with the serious sci-fi programs, i.e. Star Trek, and (shudder) Dr. Who. Is that the characters seemed so different from real people. Nobility, courage, and comradeship are commonplace. I'm not saying you won't find the premise of Red Dwarf unbelieveable, but the characters portrayed are much closer to the real thing than any ""serious"" sci-fi I'd ever seen. They're peevish, self absorbed, cynical, fun loving, and a little drunk. They argue, conive, and only stick together when the chips are down. The entire Red Dwarf series is a blast, but the first volume sets the tone. Since they didn't have the capacity for high tech visuals, they rely on excellent character developement, cunningly contrived by Grant/Naylor (the creators). Be careful this stuff is addictive and a hell of a lot of fun. This tape is for all those people who would have just ONCE liked to have heard Data tell Jordy to go Smeg himself!!"
5,Beautiful barns in great photographs,"Take a tour of 240 old and new barns throughout the United States with this book's clear photographs and concise descriptions. You'll have a good introduction to our regional styles and to the amazing variety of different barn types. If you're planning to design or build a barn, you can't help but be inspired by the many photos of building details."
4,a must read!,"This book it's a good upgrade from te ""principles of self defense"" from Jeff Cooper. Very valuable info in it!"
2,Too short to be a book,"This is a very tiny book printed with huge letters inside. Basically, it can easily be summarized as a long magazine article. The basic point the author makes is that you need to be mentally prepared to face a confrontation and not hesitate or act weak because criminals will abuse you otherwise.These topics are largely covered in Gabe Suarez's book The Tactical Pistol, together with other more useful topics, so you are better off getting that book instead."
4,Must read book for anyone that carries concealed,"Gabe Suarez doesn't hold back and has the experience to back it. The book isn't about techniques but the mindset to win a gun fight and then deal with the aftermath.Other books like ""On Combat"" and ""On Killing"" deal with some of the psychological aspects of the human reaction to a gun fight in much greater depth but Gabe's experience adds authenticity to the subject."
1,Quickly classic camp,"Anyone interested in maudlin religious camp will be right pleased by this disc, even though it often crosses the line from so-bad-it's-good to so-so-bad-it's-good-it's-bad.This, combined with a viewing of REEFER MADNESS or COCAINE FIENDS, would make an excellent party. Don't forget the Pabst."
4,For Kids that like to keep moving...,"The lyrics are chanted, rap style, with kids doing the lyrics, and the beat just gets my kids to jumping around. They love it, I, myself, couldn't listen all day to this but it is noisy clean fun for the young ones!"
5,great product,Excellent swing aid for all golfers to get the swing straightened out. I love to work with this especially early in the season. The MEDICUS can be taken to the range and used just like any club. Be sure to watch the video when you're first trying it or it can be frustrating. I swing it in the living room all winter long.
2,Looks nice but there are a few flaws,"I purchased this Steelers Garden Flag back in August. I used it for about a month during football season but swapped it out midway through the season for a different flag. The photo of the product is accurate. I thought perhaps that the photo was actually a photoshop of the flag onto a flag stick. It is not. The ""Pittsburgh"" at the top of the flag is actually where the horizontal loop is. So the flag stick goes through the word giving it an strange appearance. The flag itself faded very quickly and seemed to attract mildew.If you are a Steelers fan and want a garden flag to show your spirit go with one of the others available."
1,too small!!!!,"I bought the stand that was recommended (you know, the ""buy these together"") but the flag is very small and looks funny on this big stand. Will have to buy a new flag."
3,pole is not included,"It's my own fault for not reading the item description, but I assumed I'd be getting the stand to come with the flag. If the pole isn't included, it shouldn't be in the picture. I was so excited to get my flag, but now I need to go buy the stand to put it on."
2,ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE,"I used to watch this on t.v. years ago, and just loved it. I know there are some very good shows that were made, but these particular ones were not in it."
4,Review of an Anthropological Ethnography,"Semai: A Nonviolent People of Malaya is an Ethnography of the Semai (an indigenous people of South East Asia). The Semai are oart of the Orang Asli still living in Malaysia. Dentan bases the book on his own experiences with the Semai; describing their culture, technology and effect of the Western world on their way of life. The book is a little dated (as it was written in the 1970's). But documents a little known piece of humanity well. If native peoples, humanitarian causes and South East Asian culture are of interest to you, I recommend this book highly. There are other books on this topic on this site (just do a keyword search for Semai)."
3,Bowdabra ....,Eventhough I was expecting this to be slightly different my bows came out great. It basically helps you to hold the ribbon down so you can make a bow. I did not watch the video because I do not know where my VHS player is. You do get a pamplet that helps you on doing various bows. If you can find it on sale and skip the shipping fee it is worth it.
1,Not Satisfactory,"I experienced accuracy problems due largely to the base being way too flexible. Also, the method of attatching the router (A Porter Cable 690) to the base is not secure, allowing the router to shift while cutting. I do not recommend this tool."
3,"good product, could be more accurate","good product, could be made with less play in the fittings. If you are not carefull, it will move a small bit, making circles slightly imperfect."
2,Caution!!!,I purchased the Craftsman version of this circle guide. I never even attached my router to the base. I returned the guide immediately because it was apparent right out of the box that it was incapable of producing an accurate circle. The problem is the router base that is part of the guide turn-locks into the larger circular plate. When it locks into place there is an annular space that allows the router base to slop around inside the larger jig base with a surprising amount of play. The turn-lock feature does nothing to eliminate this play. I have no reason to believe my guide was simply a bad one. I believe they are all produced to this tolerance. Other reviews made note of this same problem.
3,Gaget,"Kind of flimsey. Setup is not all that easy or accurate. Will work to cut a circle. Though is best to have 2 people operating it--one to hold jig, one to run the router."
1,JUNK!,"wobbly, flimbsy, inaccurate,accurate to within maybe a half an inch .worst 30 dollars i ever spent"
5,Aa Aa Aa,"Yeap, THE KINGS DID IT AGAIN WOW! THIS CD IS AMAZING PEOPLE.A.B. THE MASTER MASTER OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS WOW, I just love it.This album has it all people, you'll love it.This cd is not only filled with all the great work that A.B. and the Kings bring to us, But it also has OZOMALTI, EL GRAN SILENCIO, LIMI-T 21, CHRIS PEREZ AND JUAN GRABIEL. IT COULDN'T BE MORE COMPLETE THAN WHAT IT IS. BUY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT."
4,Allright CD,"This cd was very nice, I liked a lot of the songs. I don't really care for the No tengo dinero song, I think the songs that I liked most were the ones that featured Frankie. But it is worth buying if your a kumbia king fan."
3,explanation,"I've never received the disc I am very upset for the situation, I need to buy a lot of discs but we have this problem I went to my local postal office and they said me never received something for me. Tell me if you can send the discs in the way as we know in Mexico as ""registrado"" in I HAVE TO SIGN DOCUMENTATION ""FIRMAR DOCUMENTO"" with the porpouse to have a better control with the package, and as I know its 100% safety.Sorry I can't write in English well, greetings"
1,The Worst Project A.B. Quintanilla has done!!,"First, let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the Kumbia Kings. That being said, this is probably the worst album I have ever heard! There is not one good cumbia on this entire CD. I thought this CD was bad, but then I heard the remake of New Kids on the Block's ""Please Don't Go Girl"" and I couldn't stop laughing. What the hell were they thinking. If you are smart, you will not buy this CD!!"
5,Track Listing,"Track Listing:ADORO1.Adoro2.Camino...

4,enjoyable easy listening,Very easy listening with an exxcellent orchestra. Some original renditions of music with a light latin flair for all ages
5,Stunning in every regard!,"This DVD contains three ballets by Alonzo King and a very well done documentary on him and his ballet company, with interviews of Alonzo King and some of his dancers, as well as technical contributors. As is the trend these days, the dancing is a blend of modern dance and ballet, including dancing on pointe. There are plenty of solos and pas de deux. The ballets are mostly abstract, but there are some thematic elements, especially in Scheherazade. The level of the dancing and choreography is top notch, as are the technical features such as sound, image, camera work, and lighting. The process of presenting the ballets for video is also discussed in the documentary. This should appeal to all who love modern ballet."
3,Sac Town --Dre D,"This was the first Dre D cd I owned, I bought it because of the guest appearences, I had never heard of dude. I found though that I like Dre D's flow...if you haven't heard him before he raps with a scruffy low toned voice in a quick manner and is pretty funny. I remember actually busting up laughing at some of his punchlines. I can't compare this cd to his older work, but for me I didn't feel like I wasted my [...] bucks upon purchase. I would buy his other cd's used if i saw them. I sold this cd a long time ago, looks like that was a mistake though..over [...] bucks used on here..c'mon now!!Peace"
3,Too Many Guest Appereance's!!,"dre-d's 3rd solo album is aight, but it could have been alot better without all the other artists on the album. overexcited is by far the best cut on the whole album! i give 3 starts, but the production lacks on a few songs and the guest appereances make it only 3 stars!!"
2,OK I suppose,"The kit is quite flimsy but will get the job done. Also, upon inspecting the contents when first opened, I noticed that Rockler had sent a kit that had been previously used and returned. Not too hard to see why it would have been returned."
3,getting replacement parts,"While I was learning to use the SIGNCRAFTER I accidently dropped it, and broke a piece off one of the end frames. I e-mailed MILESCRAFT about what had happen and gave them the replacement part # from the instruction sheet to get a new one and haven't heard back from them. Had I known you can't get parts for it if something happens or no response from the co. I would have looked elseware.HandyGlen"
4,Beginner router user here!,"Upon receiving the item I opened the box and was surprised at the amount of items in the package. I've read some reviews that have stated that the template kit flexes when using the router. I have not had this problem, my router must not be as big as others I guess. If assembled correctly and you tighten everything before using the router this kit is good for beginners such as myself. It's fun, and the instructions are easy to follow. I used a piece of scrap wood to get the hang of it, routed my name and the next time I was ready to go!I only have one issue with the kit and that is only one router bit is in the kit for the larger letters. So be prepared to purchase a smaller box cove bit for use with the kit."
2,It'll drive you crazy!!,"I've had this device laying around for a couple years. If you can spend some time literally re-building it you can muddle your way through some nice signs. You will quickly learn that the basic concept is excellent but it all went downhill from there. Flimsy plastic parts, wobbly aluminum rail, no reasonable way to clamp things (I end up SCREWING the whole thing to my bench) and you need six hands to do some of it. Somewhere out there there's gotta be a better way to do this. If this basic device was made with care and good materials, even if it cost more, it would be a nice little toy."
1,Milescraft sign kit,Some parts are of poor design as follows. Built in clamps to hold template to work piece does a very poor job. Clamps to hold rail extensions also holds very poorly. I had to create my own low profile parts to hold the kit firmly to the work piece. Other than the clamping problems the kit works well.
3,Signmaking Kit,"This was a gift and I understand not too easy to use. It also has to make very large lettering and so the gift was not well received,."
1,Junk is junk,"I purchsed two sets of Milescraft to make wood signs. They were both worthless junk. Save you money and temper. They burn out and break. The set up is horriable. The letters fall out while working and the routing seldom goes as advertised. A total sham, two thumbs down. To bad there isn't a set of metal letters to buy. No burning into the cheap plastic letter template or having them break."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is full of inconsistency and errors. And is very unprofessional. First it doesn't show you how to properly setup the override systems, which means all of your template edits will be overwritten upon your first upgrade. It also tells you how to do things that are not possible with Zen Cart. For instance, it covers adding products without categories, the problem with this is your products won't show in the category side box. This book does more to confuse, than it does to help. I would suggest staying away."
3,SMALL SLIDING EYE CARRIERS,This is the type carrier I need but these are miniture compared to what I have and I can't find any that are bigger like mine. These are like maybe 1/3 the size of mine that is on the curtains in my camper. Also I can't believe the what they charge for shipping and handling as I bought two packs of these which weighed less than 1 lb. and I got charged $5.98 and the shipping was ELEVEN DOLLARS and some cents to send less than a pound of merchandise. Absolutely unreal as far as I'm concerned! UNHAPPY CAMPER RON
2,Too Depresing,"Too little plot and character development (rather shallow), and a generally depressing movie. This was all rather predictable as well."
1,not very good for a adult,i got this for my daughter to replace a camera that was stolen its not very good pictures are blurry no way to focus but thats my fault i should've read the description better
3,old fashioned ghosts,"this collection contains a good deal of godd ghost stories, like an eddy on the floor and the shadow on the wall, making it a worthwhile read. old fashioned ghost stories. silent, subtle, growing on you. why only three stars? well, the uninteresting stories in the collections are really uninteresting. sometimes i don't see the interest at all. but you should still buy this."
5,A Must See For All The Family,Do you ever feel that this type of media is just for the kids? Think out of the box! My wife and I are in the mature state of our life and we cannot tell you how much we have been blessed by this entire series. So much depth of spiritual content you will not want to miss a single episode. Make it a family night for your children and grandchildren. Pour spiritual truth into them with this unique God given dramatic presentation. You will not be disappointed!!!!
4,they do the job,"they are perfectly fine and nice. not strikingly stunning or anything - but nothing is wrong with them at all, and they look nice lined up on my bookshelves where all the stray junk used to be."
1,Helpful? Too costly to find out for the average person!,"I have researched this ARVD website in hopes of gaining insight, information and answers to this heart disease that I have been diagnosed with, however, with the price being this outrageous....well, I guess I'll have to rely on a library or my misguided physicians!"
1,Duplicitous title ........................................,"The lead review by ""Glenn"" was written 10 years ago and is still the only review he has ever written. That should tell you how much you can trust him.This book is called ""Cyberbranding"" but there is almost nothing in it about branding. It is a PR/marketing book written by a PR/marketing person, masquerading as a branding book because no-one would want to read another tired PR/marketing book written by someone trying to pad out a CV to charge higher fees.I bought my copy for $10 in 2004 but it has consistently repelled my attempts to get interested in it. The markdown sticker says ""AGED STOCK"". God knows how many people thumbed through it and had the same problem as me, but were smart enough not to buy it.If you are interested in branding, the only author you need to read is Al Ries."
3,Nice image quality. Terribly slow capturing.,"This thing takes forever to capture an image. Don't purchase this camera if you need to take many photos in a short period of time. This camera takes almost 10 full seconds to capture a single image. The proprietary xD card format requires a separate reader, unless you have a multi-card reader. 32MB doesn't give much space for image storage. I'll probably be selling this camera and paying just a little more for a much better camera."
2,Great price but I'm disappointed,"I was thrilled with the price and had heard rave reviews from the photo person at Longs but my results were not very good. The pictures I took in the Macro mode were blurry. I also found the software part totally confusing. My Canon camera was super easy to get onto the computer and edit easily, but I could not figure this one out. Perhaps if you are well versed in Olympus products it will work well for you."
2,Don't get this watch if you are left handed,"When my husband put this watch on we couldn't figure out how he was supposed to read the watch! It was so weird! If you are right handed you might be able to see this watch a bit better, but the strange angle of the dial face is still a bit tough."
4,Nice watch...Go Gunners!!,I'm an Arsenal fc fan and what a way to support my team!!! Nice watch..Very stylish and sporty!!! Like the fact that it has both day and date dials as well. My only issue is that the face plate is purple but no big deal!!!
5,Strongly recommended reading for classroom teachers and aspiring writers,"Ordinary Miracles: Harness The Power Of Writing And Get Your Point Across! by Danny Iny is an informed and informative introduction to the writing process as a modern medium for communication. Insightfully providing readers with information clarifying the misinformed understandings presented in grade school and how they might be effecting the writing of many students, Ordinary Miracles addresses such issues as writing structures for effectively presenting solid and compelling arguments; how grammar can be used effectively by sometimes breaking rules; the subtle differences in structure and how it affects readers; and how to choose just the right words to get a specific point across. Ordinary Miracles is very strongly recommended reading for classroom teachers and aspiring writers for its concise understanding of the process of writing as an evermore creative, persuasive, and informative medium for communication."
4,A Suprize Hit,"My initial response was that the book had a lot of empty pages and 4 sheets of very detailed but small stickers. However the childen loved it. It keeps them busy especially childen six years and up. But it's not really suitable for the younger children, not flashy enough. I would suggest one of the other publications with less stickers"
3,Ok book,"I ordered this book thinking that it was like a regular sticker book (one that told a story and you put the stickers on the pages). But it was a sticker book where you write down everything you find out while playing the game, watching the cartoon, and collecting the toys. It was a good book if you want it for those reasons."
1,Skip this one......,I purchased this video thinking it was the Peter O'Toole/Sophia Loren movie of the same title. It turned out to be a poor quality animation that had very little redeeming value (even for kids). Do yourself a favor....skip this one.
4,Philanthropy,"Essential for anyone interested in theology related to the old and new Testament. Very deep and a bit meandering at times, but still recommended."
5,Go to the source,Along with Josephus no source is cited more than Philo when it comes historical biblical study. Incredibly literate and actually entertaining.
4,Everything it Promised,"I needed an editing software package for my blossoming digital photography hobby. With very little background in photo editing software, I was able to begin the most basic tasks without referrencing the book or help screeens! This software can do a lot, so it will take quite a while to get through all the learning curve, but that's not because its' hard, its' just packed full of a lot of features. I love it!"
4,love it,Great program for the price. I had experience with Photoshop LE so it was easier to use than it might be for a beginner. Online help not very good.
2,Photoshop Elements 1,I highly advised if your not experience with the program you might want to take a class on it or buy newer versions of this Adobe product. It does not ask for you to backup your orignal file before editing. I high recommend making a backup of your photo file before making changes to the Photo.I bought this program to run on Windows XP and below for my own evaluation.
1,Not stable under Windows 2000,"I installed this on Windows 2000 and it worked at first. Over time I've installed other software and now it no longer works. I've spent hours and hours trying to get it to work again and no suggestsions could be found in the knowledge base that solved the problem. I've removed most of the other software on my machine, re-installed multiple times and it still refuses to start. The failure message is too cryptic to be of much help. I'm wiping the disk this weekend and will reinstall everything. I'm hopefull that I can get things running again otherwise I wasted my money as well as my time."
5,Most helpful book!!!,This book is just what I was looking for to enable me to learn how to use Photoshop Elements. He takes you step-by-step through the techniques to accomplish whatever that lesson is about. I am so very pleased and excited to learn what the next chapter will hold. I highly recommend this book for any beginner...like me.
4,Great for the person who isn't a professional,"Got this program when it was first out when there was a special deal locally. I figured for [$$]it was worth a try.I use it OFTEN and REALLY LIKE the feature that let's you save an image for the Web. It's saved me much grief and lots of hassles.Unfortunately the help on the program stopped working and a fresh installation didn't fix the problem. Now the crop box no longer follows the cursor. (NO, I don't have a virus present.)I'm hoping that if I update the V 2.X these problems will disappear but not counting on it.I recommend this program if you want some reasonable power and ease of use."
4,Terrific Program,"I have about 7 different types of photo software, but none offer all of the tools that Photoshop Elements includes. While this program is a step down from Photoshop, and it's not really for a novice, it has a wealth of tools to utilize to create fabulous images from your photos et. al., including some that Photoshop doesn't have. Adobe also offers on-line help and tutorials to help you through, and there's a good number of books that can assist the user. The manual is a little tedious, but most of the fun is in discovering (by mistake!) the range of different applications that can be used on the same photo. Besides, with the rebates that are being offered, it's the best deal in town!"
3,The not-so-light fantastic,"For those of us who have no desire to publish the work we've prepared with Photoshop (RGB only), ""Elements"" is a useful light version of, say, a full-scale version such as Photoshop 6. Decumentation, however, leaves much to be desired. The book accompanying the application is confusing and seems out of order. The tutorials are worse. Unless one prints them out, it's virtually impossible to work with them.Despite these major failings, Adobe Photoshop Elements is vastly superior to Photoshop Deluxe, and seems to be bargain."
2,PhotoShop LE,"Adobe PhotoShop Elements seems just like LE. The claim is that they added all the functionality of PhotoShop to an affordable graphics design package, but in truth the only viable feature is the ability to merge. I know of at least 3 other image editors and graphics design packages offer so much more than Elements. While Adobe is a household name, Elements will not be."
3,"""Not for a novice""","I purchased this product with a lot of expectations. .... After reading thru 13 chapters. I ""Finally"" figured out how to make the program to ""size"" the images corrdctly and ""not"" cut the heads or feet off. If your fairly new to computer photo programs you may want to reconsider this product. It's manual, reads like a Military text book. This might be ok if your in the military. But for those of us who are not?....I suggest looking elsewhere. The idea behind the program is ""great"". Once you figure out how to do ""anything"" at all. It seems to run smoothly. But hardly worth the money that it costs. Too bad, as if it were more easly understandable?.....Might make a good ""Toy"""
4,Excellent Female Superheros!!,My two young daughters enjoyed this video a lot. It was really wonderful for them to have women role models like this. The characters are feminine and yet still strong and determined. I definitely recommend this for girls ages 4 to 7.
4,Looks Good,I bought this a while ago to replace one of those skull hitch covers that I broke.It looks pretty cool.It feels like a nice solid piece.
1,"U-Boats; History, Development and Equipment 1914-1945","One star? Perhaps more if Amazon or the publisher had ever delivered on this book.This is the first book order that I have ever had a problem with Amazion. I have ordered many other books from Amazon and the transaction has always been prompt and satisfying.I had this book on order for a cost of about $30 last year for 5 months and and finally gave up and cancelled the order. I decided to attempt to order the book again this year for a cost of about $28. I gave up after 3 months and cancelled the order again.Now, the book is orderable again for $45. Would it ever be shipped? I don't believe I would ever attempt to order this book again, unless I got some type of a guarantee from Amazon that the book would actually be shipped within the time as advertised!Regards,Don_"
5,An excellent volume on the subject....,"As its inside cover states, this oversized book is full of maps, technical drawings, tables, rare photos, and stories. So you see its more than just an informative factual textbook, it is also an easy to enjoy coffee table book, nicely bound on good paper (Brasseys Hardback ISBN: 1574882465).One large table over many pages lists very nearly every U-Boat number and its type, builder, commisioned date, and its ultimate eding: fate, date, final captain, place, means, dead, and saved, e.g.U-1229; Type IXC/40; built by Duetche; commisioned January 13,1944; Sunk; on August 20, 1944; Captained by Zinke, A; at SE of Newfoundland; by USN aircfaft: VC-42 (Bogue); 18 dead; ? # Saved.More text than anything else, but also there's always some sort of graphics on every page, well maybe not at the index :)If you need only one volume on U-Boats this might be the very best choice."
2,A disappointment and misleading....,"On the box of this dual dvd set, one is lead to believe this is a comprehensive history of firearms from their humble and primitive beginnings to the sophisticated weapons of today. Not quite.What we have here are really a series of crude, amateurish and recycled US Army training films from the early 1980's that are as engaging as old reruns from the ""A-Team"". A few of the segments are vintage WWII training films in color, like ""Meet the Enemy,"" a 20 minute army training film on German battle tactics in the field. But this is not enough to recommend this set. I purchased my set for $4.99 at Ross-Dress For Less than the $9.99 list price here on Amazon. Nonetheless, even a two star rating is too generous for this dvd set."
2,Servicable and OK for Newbies,"Well I was disappointed, but I appreciate that people new to innovation processes might be happier. Also, it is a light book suitable for people who are browsing and don't really want to study. There are some interesting case studies that are well, kind of cool.I was looking for some new ideas on innovation. This book was more of a statement of the current thinking on innovation. It also had a number of case studies or lengthy anecdotes, which are OK. These lengthy stories are pretty common in business books, but are more business journalism than real scholarship. They are also heavy on high profile industries, which I find repetitive."
2,Jealousy by Alain Robbe-Grillet,"I bought this book for a class I had, and it wasn't really the kind of book I usually read. I found there to be no plot line and it bored me to death. It's good if you like a story that is focused on what's written between the lines."
2,Going to pot.,"Red Dwarf went from strength to strength. Series 5 was amazing, Series 6 was even better. Then came Series 7. It started out with a strong episode, Tikka to Ride, and the two episodes which followed (Stoke Me a Clipper and Oroboros) were highly enjoyable. But after that things just fell apart. The loss of Rimmer is heavily felt, Kochanski is just irritating throughout this series, the tone of the episodes feels self-satisfied, the characters are just crude parodies of their former selves and the humour is very thin on the ground.Red Dwarf 7 Byte 2? The three episodes here are Duct Soup, Blue and Beyond a Joke. There are a few good moments, such as Kryten on the rampage in Jane Austin artificial reality. But that, and throwing in GELFs, rogue simulants and mechanoids, can't make up for deadbeat scripts. Thankfully Red Dwarf escaped the mire with the far superior Series 8."
2,I was feeling very blue indeed when Series 7 finished.,"I am a great Red Dwarf fan, which is why I was horrified by the way Series 7 went after Rimmer left. 'Duct Soup' must be one of the most boring Red Rwarf episodes ever written. What is wrong with these episodes is they lack the complicated and inventive plots of previous series, and the humour is very thin indeed. The characters are now just crude imitations of their former selves and they never seem to explore interesting locations like in older many episodes, just sit around moping. There are some good moments like the Rimmer theme park in 'Blue', and the guest appearance of Don Henderson in 'Beyond A Joke' certainly enlivens an okay episode. But most of this is all just dragged-out and nothing-special. If you're a die-hard Red Dwarf completist then this will be worth it, but just don't use it to show someone new to Red Dwarf how great the programme is."
4,Apologies for This Misguided Review,"MY BAD was worth reading just for its description of Ashlee Simpson's notorious appearance on Saturday Night Live: ""the vocal track from the song she'd already sung started playing, thus exposing her as a lip-syncing fraud reduced to galumphing a little jig as she prematurely left the stage.""(Naturally, a Simpson apology followed, and a lame one at that.)While it was fun to revisit some of the misstatements and retractions of yesteryear, MY BAD also afforded this reader a learning experience, namely: I had no idea Ted Turner was such a chowderhead. He has had to publicly apologize many more times than I realized. Others luminaries herein include Ronald Reagan (a thoughtless ninny, surprise!) and most members of his first cabinet.As an Oregonian, I was sorry to give the Hall of Shame Award to Senator Bob Packwood (Republican, in office 1969-1996) for filling over two pages in this book with his equivocating mea culpas."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this book would be funny. It is not. It is, however, very politically correct."
4,Milescraft Inlay system,"The the first time I used it, it worked great, perfect fit. As long as you're steady handed on your router, as with all pattern work. For the price with the templates and carbide bit, beats anything out there. As with all inlay work, hone your skills on a test piece."
4,better selling through titles with the word sex in them,"...this is the best yoga tape I've done (although I admit I've done only one other yoga tape and one pilates) Still, something in this workout ""works"". It seemed more difficult to learn the routine (perhaps certain movements because I was unable to look at screen to see what I was supposed to do) I wonder however if this is being sold as ""Better Sex through Yoga"" in order to sell this Yoga tape. The movements did make me feel more centered and stronger, but I don't think the tape would need to be titled that -- Inner Core Yoga may be more accurate. The only ""sex"" reference seemed to be a goofy smile the trainer (yoga teacher) had at the end --when she said check out the other tapes if you can keep up -- and her occasional crooked smiles throughout, as though the cameraman (or someone)was saying something funny offscreen."
2,not quite what I expected,"These slippers do keep your feet warm but the ""rubber"" sole feels more like foam and is not flexible so I'm a little nervous about wearing them outside a lot because I don't think they'll hold up. Also I ordered a size 8 and received a size Large so I guess they are not really sized by 6, 7, 8, etc. They were a little big but it would cost me money to send them back and pay a restocking fee so wasn't worth sending back. I wouldn't buy these slippers again."
3,A fine headset,"I use these for digital transcription, and the sound quality is good, but after a while, the ear pieces start to cause bruise-like soreness in my outer ears. I know this is fairly unique to my ears, as iPod ear buds make me sore also, but just thought I'd throw that in just in case anyone else has the same issue. So these are good for short-term use for me, but I can't wear them more than a couple of hours of work. On the plus side, the super long cord is fabulous, as I don't feel tethered while wearing them."
5,No Problems,"Purchased these for our office as replacements for the E61 headphones that came with the Olympus AS4000 digital transcribers. Work just fine. These take the ""sock"" type ear cushions, whereas the E61 headphones take the ""beret hat"" type ear cushions, so if you need replacement cushions, just note that they each take a different cushion."
2,Not worth it,These headphones were not as good in sound quality or comfort to my ear buds or other headphones I have previously used. Also the covers for the phones come off very easily and get lost.
3,Nothing Special,"I bought this headset for audio transcription. The way it was touted on the referring website, I expected something special, but it's just okay. Audio quality is no different from that of the $10 headsets I buy at brick-and-mortar stores (except others are stereo, this one is mono).HEADS-UP, though (no pun intended): Headband is not adjustable and seems designed to fit someone with either a large head, or big hair. Being short-haired & small-headed, the only way I can use it is to let the headband rest on the back of my neck. The extended cord comes in handy though.If I had it to do over again, I'd pass on this one and continue using headsets I already own. Next time I do buy a headset, I'll look for more features, such as volume control on cord and, obviously, adjustable headband."
2,Very flimsy design,"I only had them for about 8 weeks before it broke, the wires came right out of one of the ear pieces. I used them for transcription, and while the sound quality was not great, it was okay. I just can't believe they broke so soon after I bought them!"
4,Excellent text for the Sermon on the Mount,Charles Talbet's book on the Sermon on the Mount is highly recommended for understanding the Sermon on the Mount within its context of The Gospel of Matthew and the cultural background of the first century. While not necessarily agreeing with Talbert's view of the development of Christianity he does seem to have a good grasp of how the Sermon fits into Matthew's gospel. I would recommend it for preachers and adult Bible class teachers who want to go a little deeper and can understand an author who goes a little deeper than usual biblical studies. It is not for the average Christian but a good preacher can use the material to shape lessons that will be helpful to the average Christian. It is a book I'm glad is now in my library.
4,F&S -- whatever they do is fabulous,"These are the two funniest people ever. However, this DVD is from an early, formative time and the material is little uneven. That said, it's still French and Saunders, and there's nothing better."
5,Dawn French: Comedy's resident goddess extraordinaire!,"Yes,I bought this tape on Dawn French's strength alone...She's every bit as funny as any Jim Carrey and Gorgeous to boot.I first noticed her incredible chameleon-like comedic talent on the BBC series ""Murder most horrid"".And on this tape she is,again,in fine form...changing from girl to dirty old man to Elizabeth Taylor...She knows her craft...very well.She deserves more recognition here in the states...buy this tape and you'll see!"
2,Fench snd Saunders all over agai,I am a French and Saunders fan and this recording of various TV shows they did in Britain is very amusing. I received it quickly after ordering it through Anazon. Can't think of any problems.
3,VERY hit and miss....,"....I think the first two DVD compilations are a bit better. The first 15 minutes or so are amazingly unfunny. However, once you hit the ""It's Great!"" sketch, things improve dramatically. Also, some of the dialogue is difficult to catch, as these ladies tend to speak quickly, and with a British accent. I would recommend the earlier releases over this one or ""Living In a Material World"" which was released at the same time as this one."
3,CD-ROM Not compatible with VISTA,Book is great. WARNING: CD-ROM not compatible with VISTA. Called Delmar Learning and they were not at all sympathetic. There are no plans to release a VISTA compatible CD-ROM.
1,Worst Textbook,"Of all the books I had to purchase while studying to be a Radiologic Technologist this was the poorest, by far. It is poorly written , does not follow through on its chapter objectives and is a real challenge to read."
1,What?,"Dont own it, but I'd just like to complain that this shirt doesnt even quote the movie correctly. The line is actually ""WHEN I get home, Im gonna PUNCH yo momma in the MOUTH!""..This shirt had some serious potential. Almost bought it. Thank god I read it first.."
2,Messed my computer up!!!!!!!,This modem totally messed up my computer. I ended buying a whole new system with a modem built in. The seller was great though. I highly recommend them. They sent me out a new modem no questions asked. I would trust this seller and buy from them again. They really can't help that the modem was a piece of junk.
2,Historical inaccuracies abound,"A particularly glaring error fabricates a civilwar between Mary I and Elizabeth I after thedeath of Edward VI. There was no such civilwar. The successions of Mary I and Elizabeth Iwere peaceful with the exception of the uprisingin favor of Lady Jane Grey, which was put down byMary, and though carried out by Protestantscompletely disowned by Elizabeth, as a basicsurvival measure."
1,"Uninformed, superficial, exuding prejudice and smugness, politically biased","This must be the worst book on Italy I have ever read. The author displays phenomenal ignorance and his judgement is superficial almost to the point of being funny! Were it not for some specific anecdotes he tells rather amusingly, I would have wondered whether he ever set foot in the country at all. He is obsessed with Berlusconi, he just hates the guts of the man. Well that's fine, many Italians do too, but it does not make for informative reading. His writing style is full of smugness, he says he loves the country but he is very condescending toward Italians and does not display the least interest in truly integrating in Italian society. Inaccuracies are too many to list here. A book that is better avoided by those who want to understand contemporary Italy."
4,Worth Knowing,"The dimensions discussed are worth knowing about, or for one who has lived in Italy, worth remembering. All nations are complex. Italy being such a beautiful country one forgets that it has, like any other, a side to it that is not all milk and honey."
1,Simply Doesnt Work,"Worked fine on Windows 98, but when loaded into WindowsXP, it wouldn't launch. The developers don't provide any support, so they were no help either.It's unfortunate, because it did the job that needed to get done, it just didn't do it on a computer newer than 1997."
2,Disappointing,"Life Uncommon is one of the stand-out compositions from Jewel's musical career. The single is quite the opposite. A greatly missed opportunity, both in its normal format or the potentially great gospel version attempted here, this one-track CD-single is certainly only worth its price. It's great that it's for charity, but Jewel has certainly shown she can perform incredibly better than she does here, and for its purpose it's a wonder she didn't. Disappointing for Jewel fans, even, and even though it does grow on you - the original album version is ten times better."
5,My absolute favorite Jewel song! Another outstanding job!,I love this song. It is my favorite in the album and it's interesting to hear a gospel rendition of it. It's a great song and I encourage everyone to buy the single and the Spirit CD!
2,Disappointing,"I thought I was going to learn something new with this video. Didn't happen. If you have never placed a trade before in your life. You might benefit from it. If you have ever read an ""Introduction to day trading"" book, then you probably won't learn anything new either. It is a lecture at a convention and he wastes a lot of time talking about things like where the words bull and bear came, etc. When it was over I said to myself ""That's it! You have got to be kidding me! What a waste!"" But like I said, if you are brand spanking new to trading, you might benefit from it."
4,Secret Language,"Hi! This album is GOOOD!!! I like it! Es ist wirklich sehr gut. Gute Sound, gute Stimme. Du soll es einfach selbst hoeren. Viel Spass!!! ;-)"
3,Epideme/Nanarchy,"Red Dwarf series 7 started off excellently but after Rimmer left in the second episode (though he was briefly seen in episodes 3 and 5) this seventh series started going downhill. It was good as a science fiction series, but somebody forgot it's meant to be funny. The A to Z of Red Dwarf makes this video one not to miss, however."
5,Emotion in Song,"If you don't care for Irish music or beautiful voices then this video is not for you. For the rest of you, if you do not get this video you will be missing out of one of life's golden moments. A glass of fine wine adds the finishing touch."
3,Childhood Favorites,These are the songs - sung in the style - that I grew up with prior to WWII! I loved them then and it is wonderful to hear them again whenver I put the tape on! My Grandparents came thru Canada and my Grandfather had a great voice.
4,Converted to DVD,Wanted this program on DVD but it wasn't availabele in that format - so I got a used tape and converted it to DVD myself. No problems.
5,Read This Book!,"I'm not through with the book yet, but after reading 1/2 of it, I've got to let readers know about it! If the second half of the book is as good as the first 1/2, Blake Dawson has a best-seller on his hand. Exciting, thoughful, chilling. You feel like you know these characters, and so the events that occur carry quite an impact. The action moves fluidly and builds fairly quickly -- I cannot wait to get back to it!"
2,disrespectful to the customer,"I was not impressed by this tape. The bad camera work (done on a home video with bad audio and picture) combined with the cheesy music and disgusting butt and crotch shots were completely annoying. Not to mention that they spelled ""waste"" instead of ""waist"" and ""heal"" instead of ""heel"" during the workout!!Unfortunately, the good workout was hindered by all these aspects. Hopefully I'll memorize it soon so I don't have to look at the tape again. I even emailed the company because I feel the lack of effort they put into the tape disrespects the consumer. The teacher even smiled and shyly waved at someone off camera!!I wouldn't buy any other tape from this company, which is a shame because I do enjoy the actual workout."
4,"somethin'else,skechers trap digger wedge slid.","nice shoe,stays on doesen't slip.condition the leather and thay wont sqeek when you walk,very nice."
5,Love 'em!,"I got these in black and from day one they were SO comfortable and wearable. Didn't need to break them in at all. I've gotten lots of compliments on them too! A this price, I may order them in brown too."
3,shorter than expected,"It was probably there, somewhere in the product details, only I didn't see it, so I expected 60 minutes of documentary and felt disapointed when it lasted barely 15. Other than that, quite good."
5,Heavy Balls Increase Your Strength and Endurance,"Every rugby coach needs at least three of these, to work into the warm-up circle. If you're a backs coach, this should be the ball your backs use for all of their lines. Every scrumhalf needs to have one of these at home, to handle and get the feel of as he watches TV, eats dinner, and before he drifts off to sleep.As with any Gilbert product, this is a top-notch piece of rugby kit. Coming in at over two pounds, this is a seriously heavy ball, one that will work your player's arms, particularly forearms and wrists, and especially if you are strapping in with a chest band and arm restrictors.Bottom line: this is serious rugby training kit, and will work wonders on your players' ball handling and passing distances."
5,Helps headaches,I get headaches daily. I use this all of the time. It gets me through a lot of them without suffering as much. Highly recommended.
2,Not the GREATEST knock knock jokes ever,"I wouldn't say that ALL of the jokes inside this book are the ""greatest"" as the title implies. There are some very good ones, but there are just as many bad. I was quite disappointed. I was an English major in college and still can't figure out the word puns intended on some of the knock knocks. I would say some of the jokes are definitely a stretch and I'd imagine most younger children wouldn't get the jokes. Try My First Book of Knock-Knock Jokes by Tad Hills instead if you want something nice and simple that makes sense for younger children."
2,novel or document?,"to an architect the purpose of this book is unclear. The subject is an architect with an extremely interesting life, who designed very interesting buildings. The subtitle of the book gives us the impression that the book is about architecture. In reality it only gives us a very poor impression of the buildings designed by Neutra: only very small pictures are displayed of what he designed. family snap-shots on the other hand, are everywhere and in larger sizes.Of course this can be a purpose of the writer. However, the uncritical way and blind admiration for Neutra makes the book boring to read and tiresome.I suggest that anyone that is interested in the works of Neutra buy another book, with better, and more pictures of his buildings and floor plans to go with them. His buildings deserve it."
5,where has Dugan been all my life?,"I read a lot of poetry. Somehow I had completely missed Alan Dugan. Then, thankfully, the National Book Awards judges picked Poems 7 for the 2001 award. It's an extraordinary book; Dugan is an extraordinary poet. He should have won the Pulitzer, too, but he may just be too left-wing and energetic and raucous and funny for the Pulitzer. He's also dead serious, and makes a whole lot of other poets writing today look like dilettantes, dandies, stuffed shirts, lightweights and poseurs. These are mostly short, narrative, clear, yet also distinctly, and importantly, strange poems. They're working-class, brainy, rebellious, delightful. Buy this book!"
2,Uneven and immature,"It is with great disappointment that I write how unhappy I was with this book. I heard Dugan on NPR and the poems he read were intriguing...his voice plain and straightforward. In the interview he did mention that his writer's voice has not aged...that it is still 16 years old. This is obvious in most of his poetry. Even before I heard his interview I felt I was reading something written by an adolescent boy. That he can write about the mystery of skunk cabbage emerging through the snows and suddenly slip into adolescent penis metaphors makes me wonder how he won the National Book Award this month. There were a few gems and I kept hoping and wishing for more but, sadly, I couldn't find even one poem to move my world...which is what so much great poetry can do. His images felt hollow, his language trite and there was no flow...no spirit in the poetry. Sorry, this one gets returned."
3,Review,"Buyers should be aware that this is a preliminary edition. Although the body of the text is finished, photos and end of chapter problems are not. The former are entirely absent, though there are notes of what photos will appear in the final edition. The latter are partially complete; there are about 15-20 problems at the end of each chapter with notes saying more will be added.The text reads very well and is organized logically, but is rather uninviting in its layout and visual presentation. It seems to be structured under the assumption that students will read each chapter in full. Even though there are chapter summaries, it is very difficult to pick out important information by skimming the text. Wait for the final edition if this is to be the sole text from which you learn or teach physics."
4,Kids will need more than just this book...,"My 10 year old got this for a gift and she is very crafty, artistic and determined. However, I know nothing about knitting and have no interest so I can't support her efforts. With some help from family that does know how to knit, she has been able to take this book and keep moving forward with her knitting skills. However, I don't think most kids, ages 10-14 could pick up this book without any teaching support, and learn to knit. That would be asking too much. The illustrations are clear and the supplies are nice. But a kid is still going to need a class to get going."
1,Very disappointed,Bought as xmas present for daughter - she opened it and theres no book!!! That was the main reason i bought this - it said simple instructions
3,Is it me?,"I had a 10 min lesson (albeit 10 years ago) from a family friendand was able to knock out something that resembled a scarf.I purchased this book hoping that my brain would switch back on and I would remember the techniques I used to create my ""project"". I'm sorry to report.. I couldn't even get the yarn rolled without making a mess! I had such high hopes based on the other reviews.I thought I would even have a leg up since I had the ""scarf"" under my belt. Not so. I can't tie a slip or ""cast on"" after spending about 5 hours straight with this book.I will keep on trying but I must say. I was able to knit with my 10 min in person lesson and I can't do anything other than string myself up with this mess of yarn they give you. This book will be useful to me for practice after I learn to knit elsewhere."
2,not as pictured,"the book arrived and is in excelent condition but none of the items included in the picture, needles, yarn and such were included, very disappointed"
2,Not beginner friendly,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter so she could learn how to knit. After trying to just cast on for an hour we gave up and I took her and the book up to my mother-in-law who is an advanced knitter-who has learned several ways to knit-said that she couldn't understand the instructions either and just taught her herself and with in an hour my daughter was well on her way to making a scarf. We have not tried the patterns, but learning to cast on, pearl, etc is nearly impossible for an 11 year old and a 30 year old to figure out on our own. Maybe if I spent more time studying the book eventually it would click, but unless you are willing to help the beginner and you know what you are doing, I say pass on this purchase or at least go look at a book or craft store and flip through it before you buy."
4,Learn to knit,Great book with easy to follow instructions. I have enjoyed learning to knit very much and would recommend this book to others.
5,At long last ...,"This new disc of Franck's Symphony in D Minor is not only the first recording by Marek Janowski as Music Director of L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande but the best recording of the Franck D Minor symphony since Ernest Ansermet's May 1961 recording with the same orchestra. It thus joins Ansermet's and the great recording led by Pierre Monteux and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, also recorded in 1961, as the best recordings of this luminous work. That it also marks the return of the great Marek Janowski to the catalog is the real news, however. One can only hope that the good folks at Pentatone will continue their partnership with the OSR and Janowski. Bravo!"
4,"Some great moments from an excellent ""witty"" comedy","""One Foot in the grave"" is a very funny British comedy series that had a far too short lifespan. Victor Meldrew is one of the most interesting characters in TV comedy history (right up there with Basil Fawlty, The Black Adder and Hyacinth Bouquet. The show had some great episodes, although this video doesn't have the best, it's well worth it for some very funny moments."
4,A holistic approach to two aspects of Pakua practice,"As the first book ever written in the English language on a then obscure Chinese Martial System,Robert Smith's book is complete in presenting Pakua Chang in its two different aspects,The post-heaven and pre-heaven methods.The first half of the book concentrates on the post-heaven straight line method with the latter half being devoted to the pre-heaven circling method,an excellent learning tool for any beginer,combine the material in this book with the material in Park Bok Nam's two books,then you have a very comprehensive beginer self-study course in Pakua."
3,For advanced internal martial arts,"A bit of a disappointment from Mr. Smith's original book on Pakua, where he went into detail of the application of several moves before putting them together into a longer form. But then, that is how I was taught Pakua and other kung fu for years: learn the form and figure it out for yourself. If you are a ""quick fix, bust head now"" kind of trainee, this book might not be for you.If you are the more patient sort, with some Chinese martial arts background, you might be able to appreciate the balance and concentration involved in the Pakua form. It really is meditation in motion. Well photographed. A good supplement to actual instruction.Doug Setter, Bsc.author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide"
4,Good Book On Fundamentals,"eProcurement is an excellent book for the basic fundamentals of of eprocurement (eprocurement 101). We are the authors of a more advanced version for purchasing professionals already using some form of epurchasing. Our book is titled ePurchasingPlus and has input from over 30 experts and practitioners from US, UK & Canada that use ePurchasingPlus products and concepts. We recommend both books for the purchasing professional to find about the future of our profession."
5,Nontoxic Insect Repellant,I made a nontoxic insect repellant based on a friends recipe so we can sit outside in our mosquito infested environment. If you spray on enough it is fairly effective. I highly recommend it.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,I was looking for a software to convert my audio cd's to mp3's. I wasted a lot of time trying to get this software to work. I finally gave up and returned it. It didn't make sense to keep wasting time. It wasn't user friendly at all. I downloaded freebies that worked better than this. I decided to purchased Musicmatch Jukebox and I'm very pleased with it. It does a lot more than convert audio tracks to mp3 files. Magix needs to recall this software and work on it some more.
1,Horrible experience!!,I wasted most of my weekend trying to get this software to convert some songs on a cd to mp3 files. No luck at all. I tried everything. Nothing worked. I even went to there website for help or to contact their support group. Poor info and support. Don't waste your money on this. It needs more work!
1,don't waste your money on this turkey,"There is a reason Magix software is so cheap; it is not very good. It seems very buggy. I bought the boxed CD version on sale (for good reason) at Best Buy. The main reason I bought it was to edit ID3 tag data in MP3 files. The program won't install properly; it keeps thinking it's a demo. Their support was very slow to reply to me. When I finally got it running, it displays ID3 info, and will let you edit ID3 data all you want, but when you try to save your changes, they don't get saved. This thing was a disaster."
1,"Very difficult to use correctly, a waste of money.","I bought this product on-line to convert wav files to MP3. I tried calling Magix numerous times for help and kept getting bounced around from department to department. I eventually got annoyed at the snobby voice which kept transferring me to the operator, who said wait a minute without hearing my question and was gone. I was left in cyberspace never-never land. I would never buy anything else from this company, they seem to have no customer service skills and the ratings I have read have all been similar. Try the freebies on the NET, this product is terrible!!"
5,Thoroughly enjoy Zobmondo and Zobmondo Lite,I got the original for Christmas last year and took it back to school with me. It was hours of hillaroius enjoyment and oddly enough very thought provoking. There are also some very good ethical and morality questions. It is really a great way to get to know people by playing the game. I bought Zobmondo lite for my parents because they are not too crazy and they love it. We broke it out at a fairly stuffy Thanksgiving dinner and it turned up the gathering about 10 notches. It really got people out of thier shell. It truely is more than just a game.
2,A toy enthusiast,"I read the overview of this game on the box cover and thought it would be hilarious to play. Unfortunately, after purchasing the lite version, I was rather disappointed at the ease of guessing the particpants answers. Of course the object of the game is to guess how people would answer difficult scenarios or questions and I found many of the answers very predictable. If I were you, I would stick to the regular version and stay away from the Lite version."
1,"Looked fun, grave dissapointment","We purchased Zobmondo on a whim. The first dissapointing aspect of the game was the low strategy - this game is largely ruled by the luck of the dice as opposed to player ingenuity. Next we discovered that there are only approximately 30 unique question cards that get repeated again and again, and we felt we did not get our moneys worth. After this first review, the game continues to collect dust in the back of the closet. For duribility - there are cards that can be bent and torn, small game pieces that are easily misplaced (and slippery!), not to mention the rather unreliable hourglass. For education value? Nada. At least Go Fish (one of the simplest games in existance) builds memory skills. Pass on this game for education. Overall, buy something else."
2,not the best copy,episodes toward the end of the discs tend to stop and go. can't view the last episode on disc 2 at all
5,Well worth buying,"Season 3 of House was well worth buying. Hugh Laurie is a terrific actor. I can't believe a British man who played the father on Stuart Little can also play a handicapped, brilliant, arrogant, vulnerable, cyinical American doctor. Anytime we are in the mood, we watch another episode. Received product fast and in perfect condition."
4,House review,"I bought it for a cousin of mine and she really enjoys it. She is glad that she has it. She loves this show, so this was a big hit."
5,hooked on house,Great show- each season the characters continue to interest and draw the viewer in. Absolutely wonderful!
5,Not Just Good...Its House Good,"For starters season 3 begins with a twist and ends with even a bigger twist. All the main characters are further developed and if you are worried that you have heard and seen it all in the first two seasons when it comes to the cases House has to diagnose.....well dont. There is plenty more on the menu.What did piss me off with season three is that by the end of it, I was left hating the fact that I will have to wait till next August to be able to figure out what will happen next.In fact, it was only till I watched ""the behind the scenes"" footage that I managed to feel a bit better about waiting all that time. That and the fact that I must have been the first person to own and watch House season 3 in the Middle East.....Enjoy"
4,If you're used to crap this is great,"""House"" is a brilliant series by American standards. Life and death issues are always compelling. HOWEVER like so many American progs it skates over very thin ice in terms of the facts. Most of the medical stuff is mumbo-jumbo at best and highly untypical in terms of the every day world of hospital practise. The best bit about it is the psychological interplay between the main characters eg the bureaucratic Cuddy and the maverick freeloading House. By the way no wonder Hugh Laurie got an Emmy. No one would ever believe he was British! His character is genuinely complex and deserves a good deal of credit.It's very interesting to compare US and European series. The former are still very much fact/law based while the second go more for relationships. ""House"" is an interesting evolution."
5,Just gets better and better,"The acting is brilliant. The writing is brilliant. The directing is uneven. Still, it's a great TV series. Hugh Laurie brings a depth and breadth to Dr. Gregory House that no other actor could. Laurie's comedic talents give House charm, complexity, and humor even as the writers put words in the doctor's mouth that might otherwise make him despicable. Episodes are always complex. The best of them have a rich, interwoven quality in which every scene builds the central theme. The underlying issues are truly weighty--well beyond the ""mere"" saving of a patient's life. Revelations about House's values and character are written and acted with subtlety and freshness. Hugh Laurie will tire of this role long before his audience will tire of watching him. He is nothing short of captivating. I am not merely a fan, but an addict."
1,lost cd,the product is incomplete missing cd 2 of the third season please can you help whit this issue you dont send all cds of the third season the disc 2 is missing
2,This was the worst episode!,"This episode is filled with corny acting. the rape victim was laughable, the awkwardness of the the lines, the timing... idk if this was just me but this episode was extremely lame and stupidly boring to me at times. I love House and will finish the series' but this episode was cheesy."
5,House Season 3,"This is a very good addition to the first two seasons. If you liked them, then I would recommend watching season three."
5,Magnificent House!,"What can one say about House? He is truly magnificent in his arrogance, his irony, his callousness and his poor view of humankind in general. Everybody lies, he says, and he goes out of his way to prove it. There is nothing he would stop at to get his way, not friends, not compassion, not truth. What a monster! I love him. Truly, one of the best shows in all tv history. So well written, so well acted, so intelligently carried out. I, for my part, won't miss a single episode as long as it lasts and will buy each season dvds as soon as they are available. And, of course, House would not be House without the exquisite (yes, I know he is a man) Hugh Laurie."
1,poor,"When I received the order, I noticed the corner of the left side was smashed. When I opened it, the plastic casing on the inside was shattered, I cut my hands on it trying to clean up the shattered plastic in the floor. I understand that it was a previously viewed product, I just didn't expect to need first aid from opening it."
2,FLAWED PLAYBACK,"First disk, first episode, half way thru the picture repeatedly froze and pixels of pictures fell apart. The only way around it was to fast forward and miss some of the pictures and dialogue. Would not order again."
1,yuck.yet another medical show.,"how many csi spin-offs,medical dramas and comedies,and reality shows have to be put in the public's feed bag before it gets old?this stuff is like disney channel fodder for adults."
5,"The ""House Party"" continues!","As dramatic, charismatic, and unpredictable as always, House is back for its third season. More bizarre but completely logical diagnoses, more deep insight into the presence that is House, more semi-legal procedures, sharp wit, and cane-antics! If you watched season 1 and 2, there is no more reason need be said to continue your collection. If you've not, go back to the first season and purchase it before returning here. Nothing more need be said."
5,A+++++++++,One of the best episodes of tv ever. Reproduces an actual real life event in which a fetus grabs the surgeon's finger during in utero surgery to save the baby's life.
4,"Pleased, slight issue though","Came very quickly but had some initial problems with the first disc, episodes 1-5 with intermintant freezing. Problem only occurred on first disc every other disc worked fine. No visible scratches. Also tried in multiple DVD players (I was using Xbox 360 initially). Other than that very pleased with another amazing season of HOUSE. great if you need to catch up quickly especially because season 4 is started."
4,season 3 is bittersweet,"though the quality of the show is maintained, some of the major background plots that carry over between episodes felt very heavy handed and drawn out in season 3 (specifically the cop that house makes mad at him)if you love everything house, this is still well worth getting. if your someone that picks and chooses without buying every season of a series, you could skip this onei can rewatch seasons 1 and 2 alot more often than i can sit through 3 because i spend most of the time wanting to shoot the cop"
5,feed the addiction...,"I wasn't a devoted House fan until I saw the first two seasons on DVD--then I was hooked (sorry for the cliche). S3 is essential if you are looking for continuity and closure to S2, but then it presents with it's own set of challenges for Dr. House and the team. Some say that S3 isn't as good as the first two, but don't let that stop you. I will admit S1 and S2 were when the show was at its best but if you are building a collection, you know you gotta have it.DVD extras: You know what they are all about--bloopers, commentary, behind-the scenes--extra insight into the show. They seem to have gotten better since the first DVD but I can do without the ""Valley Girl"" versions of some of the episodes."
5,House Season 3 Review,This is the best product if you like doctor shows and it sells for a great price.
4,Dark,This season of House is by far the darkest yet. Between the cop and Cameron and chase thing this season is never boring. You can really so the major changes in the fallows in this season above all cameron. The drama is stay writen well and Hugh Laurie still can pull off being american over all it is great season but a little to dark for my liking.
1,BAD SELLER,HiI bought this item because in the specifications say that this is whith language in spanish. now I am in Cuernavaca Mexico and this is false. I was a gift. you don't say the true in the especificationsorry
1,missing DVD,"There's no disc 6, what the hell, did they forget or are they just that bad. I'm deployed overseas so returns are next to impossible. I just want disc 6!Angry Soldier"
2,Product in bad shape,I was unhappy with the product when it arrived. I bought a new copy of this DVD and when it arrived the outside cover was ripped and scuffed up like it had been misused. This is supposed to be a gift but I am embarrassed to give it as a gift because it looks like it was a used item.
2,Somewhat Happy,The item I bought was a multy disc set and one of the discs was rattling around inside the case.The case can't hold the dvd so everytime I open it the disc falls out.The disc works now but is getting scratched all the time.Item showed up in the time frame given
4,great read,"Edith Hamilton does a great job of painting a great picture of how Greece was formed, their general ideology, and how they have impacted out modern world, and the prose she uses to describe it is excellent.I think that anyone trying to learn a little bit about Greek history and its influence in society, this is definitely a great read."
