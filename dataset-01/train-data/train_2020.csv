2,"Not What Was Advertised, It Is Not A Belkin Cable It Is A Cheap Chinese Version.","This cable is not the name brand they are advertising on AMAZON. It is a cheaper knockoff that is probably made in China. I am sure this cable will do just what it is supposed to do but when the picture is not the same as what i received, when the post is false the advertising is false and they should be looked at by Amazon and removed from their site as a service if they continue to be this shady of a company selling on the Amazon Site."
1,Doesn't work - don't buy.,"My pc could not recognize my printer with this cable. Had to purchase another cable elsewhere. Based on this and the packaging the cable came in, I am a bit dubious about its claim to be a Belkin."
1,"Not A Belkin cable, did not work",I got a cheap looking cable in a plain plastic bag. It is not a Belkin cable as advertised and mine did not work.
1,Not a Belkin,"This is my first review on amazon after many years. This came in a generic plastic bag, the wire was very thin, unlike the picture, and says Belkin nowhere,. Looks like a bait and switch"
3,USB CABLE MATH for WEB CAM and other USB DEVICES,"This 16 feet (4.88 meter) long USB A to USB B cable = ASIN B00004Z5PY = was just right to extend my WebCam 15 feet (4.75 meter) cable (for 3Com 00371800 HomeConnect PC Digital Camera = ASIN B00000JDHV =) to 31 feet (9.45 meter). To ""connect"" the two cable bought the Linksys USB 4 Port Hub Universal Serial Bus = B00004Z6PI which has an external power supply, making sure that the 31 feet length cable (not recommended for WebCam) is working fine. The only thing I have to complain about is the small package of the 16 feet cable which squeezes the volume of the whole length to a fist size. So you will get a zigzag-worm instead a straight point-to-point connection. However, the cable works fine. I straighten it carefully with a soft towel after I had it on the sun to warm it up."
4,Uhhhh its a cable,My big thing is all about price cause there isnt much noticable difference cable brand to cable brand for the average user. This same EXACT Belkin one was almost triple the price locally. Works fine great value . Woo Hoo !
4,Belkin 16ft USB Cable,I puchased this cable for use with a USB photo printer. I wanted top quality and felt Belkin was the name that meant quality. I was not let down... the cable is of great construction and works great too.
2,PUH-Leeze,"Her editor was right the first time: she has nothing to say. This book is such an insult for aspiriting writers turing to her for advice. She doesn't give it. Holding to her chest all her cards about how to really get published, she instead thinks she can sidestep that with advice on life in general. Title is great, the reason for the title is great (her brother was overwhelmed by a report on birds and the father said take it bird by bird) but that's where her depth stops. Too bad because there are so many people with a real desire to help and guide writers but this isn't it and neither is she."
5,A must have book for all writers,"I cannot say enough about this fantastic book by Anne Lamott. Bird by Bird is a must for all aspiring writers. It is inspirational, enjoyable and funny. I couldn't put it down--as if it were a novel. It inspired me to be more diligent on my own writing and to enjoy it more. This is the kind of book that will never leave you."
3,Writing and Life,"For me the book wasn't hilarious. The writer has written honestly how it is for her. Not every writer is the same.What put me off was the language which sounded like crap sometimes, and the writer didn't let us forget about it by reusing some expressions.What I liked was a few pointers I took out and applied to my writing life and style."
4,Enjoyable and honest,"Anne Lamott has written a delightful guide to some of the more intangible aspects of writing and what to expect, should one wish to embark on the path of a writer. As has been said many times before, this is not a ""how to"" treatise. What I do like about the book is that it speaks from the author's perspective. She reveals her life to the reader in, at times, a neurotic and overwhelming manner, but she is always honest. After you read the book, you feel like you know Lamott and have gone on some of her more exciting escapades as a writer.I would certainly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to write and anyone who loves to read. The author is as honest and open as she can be for a book on writing. Ultimately, it this inside peek into her head that invites the reader to view Ms. Lamott's life as a writer and gain some semblance of a complex and interesting individual."
3,"A feel-good, easy read. But check it out from library.","This book has little instructions on writing, but a lot more on how her writing life is like. Compared with many ""how to"" writing books, this one is using her own experience, sometimes her writing experience, a lot of times her or others' life experience, sort of as an analogy to prove her points.It's almost like she's created a new sub-genre under the ""writing instruction"" category. Good for her. That's why it's an easy, make-you-feel-good read, like drinking a cup of tea. But as far as offering ground-breaking insights, or solid advices on the nuts and bolts of writing, find something else. In other words, taste good, light, but little nutrition to make you grow.I strongly suggest you check it out from your local library to read it first, then decide if you would like to splurge."
5,"Funny, Irreverent and Inspirational","This book on writing by Ann Lamott is added to my list of must-read for college level creative writing courses. It's a pleasing read that also emphasizes the real work inherent in the process of writing. Lamott details the writing process phases with humor and candor that simultaneously amuse and encourage aspiring writers. For my students, it works as a great companion piece to Stephen King's book ""On Writing."""
4,The best book on a tired topic,"Writing about how to write is innately difficult. It's also futile. People don't learn to write by reading anymore than they learn to act by watching TV. So it's hard to get through a whole book of suggestion, coaxing, admonishment and confession without wanting to slap, if not the author, the audience. But that aside, it's hard not to want to listen to LaMott. She's always a good read. Generous, candid, funny... A great example if nothing else."
4,Step by Step,"the book is more than Excellent, it gives a wonderful tips for writers and for life as well. The concept of bird by bird (step by step) is good for all life elements.It is outstanding book"
5,Caution: Good Read Ahead,"Want to write? Read this book.Want to not write? Read this book.Enjoy thinking, smiling, laughing? See the pattern?Did not relish finishing this little book. It was an oasisof clarity, good humor and widely applicable instructionsfor.....well, lots of things. Finishing it was like saying""Adios"" to a friend I knew I'd miss.Are you breathing? Read this book.Lee Fredrickson"
2,Of course it's a partial autobiography...,"Anne Lamott writes nothing but. As the case with most autobiographies, it depends on whether or not you like the voice, and I don't. I don't see the wit and graceful humor of such phrases as ""one reviewer said I was a treadmark on the underpants of life"" or ""spider puke."" (Seems these reviewers may have had a point.) Nor am I interested in her alcholism, her politics (hates Republicans--big surprise there), her eating travails, or her extremely superficial spirituality. What saved this book from a one-star rating was that she had decent advice for writers--just sit down and do it, write badly, carry index cards, etc. But that's probably been covered elsewhere without having to sit through the debris of Bird By Bird."
4,SELF ABSORBED.,"Much of the book is autobiography. The author writes well and the book is full of humor, but it's a sad book overall. And it's an angry book. The author isnt fond of Southerners, evangelical Christians, and anyone who is more successful than she is. She comes across as another flake from Marin County in California.Still, she has plenty of good advice for newbie writers and the book is entertaining."
1,Worst book ever,I was duped into buying this by all the glowing reviews. Not only is the material lousy but I became so disgusted with the author as a person I couldn't stand to read another word. She is a pitiful person and I cannot imagine anyone wanting to read a word she writes. This is a book about her sad life much more than about writing.
2,Depressing,"I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that ""As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!"""
5,From the heart funny,"I've read dozens of books on writing and this rises to the top of the heap. Funny, inspiring, revealing, authentic, and true. Lamott's style is engaging, her wisdom is invaluable, and her honesty is a treat. Give this to every would-be writer in your life."
5,good book about writing,The book is humerous as well as instructional. It is excellent for tackling writer's block. It is good for beginning writers also.
5,Letting It Flow,"Lamott explores the writing process in a way that will touch every individual. Her humorous, laid back, conversational style allows the reader to read the novel, like Lamott is speaking to them. This personal approach to writing is easy for the reader to understand, and it affords the reader the opportunity to relate personal experiences to the book. The book is a must read novel."
3,bird by bird was a nice book,"I read this this book as an assignment for English class. Despite my knowlege I was able to undertand what the author was trying to say. I was able to relate what the author was tryingin to say in the book, all the exemples she put into it. I learned to use index cards, tha was a good tip for me. Also, I write about things that I like such as she said. I think the book is ok."
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read--,"--right up there with Lamott's ""Operating Instructions."" This book may not help you much if you're looking to improve your writing, but it may be the best book you'll ever find to help you get over your blocks and WRITE.Lamott has a gift for looking at the world and especially herself with meticulous and embarrassing honesty and finally loving and accepting what she sees. Readers who are into Zen or a similar spiritual practice will find inspiration here for their practice as well as their writing.(Also recommended for encouraging you in creative expression and befriending yourself: Julia Cameron's ""Artist's Way"" and Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones"" and ""Wild Mind."")"
1,Skip this one,"I did not care for this book. It read like the writer's attempted to mix humor and personal stories about her life with some writing tips (many of which I felt were poor).Switches frequently from stories about her personal experience, references to God, and advice on writing."
3,Not my favorite writing book...,"We used this as a text for my writing class. My professor said it was great, but it didn't help me much. I've read better."
3,"""chaise longues"" is spelled correctly.","Tracy, ""chaise longues"" is spelled right. Look it up. Maybe this book isn't as bad as you think."
1,Writer About Writing,"Having struggled the issues of writing she discusses here, I wanted very much to find some guidance from Ms. Lamott. Unfortunately, there was precious little of substance. It is rather a collection of riffs on the standard topics covered in writing classes. As others say here, this is not a systematic guide for wrestling with writing, but rather her thoughts and impressions on the process. There is an audience for this kind of book, maybe writers like her. Scattered, mildly amusing, telling more about her than the difficult craft of writing."
4,Take it from someone who knows,"I loved this book. It was full of life lessons that you can use whether or not you ever write a book. This author is so wise and so funny. She has been there...done that...and is willing to share her experiences which will hopefully help keep you from making some of the mistakes she did.This book was my first experience with Lamott, but certainly not my last. She has earned my respect."
2,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I also bought this book due to its positive reviews, but found instead- a bunch of rambling by a neurotic and possibly bi-polar woman. I did like some of her humor, and yes, I probably share some of her same mental illnesses, but that is not going to help me start writing my book. She gives maybe 4 or 5 pages of advice on writing, and little advice on life. I was hoping for a combo of a self-help and how-to book, but just an autobiography of a woman who wanted to purge her problems. Stephen Kings ""On Writing"" is the best how-to book I have read as of yet."
4,in a word: inspirational,"lamott's amazing work BIRD BY BIRD breathes inspiration into even the darkest corners of any writer's block. her writing is humorous and straightforward, ""telling it like it is"". a must-read for any writer. if you read only two books on writing, make them ELEMENTS OF STYLE and BIRD BY BIRD."
4,Learn to become a better writer and a better you.,"Very interesting read that offers sound, simple strategies sure to improve your writing. I especially enjoyed LaMott's tidbits that offer some insight into overcoming life's obstacles. I found an audio recording from LaMott called WORD BY WORD and played it for some of my English students at an alternative high school. They loved it. They laughed and shared similar anecdotes from their own lives. LaMott's writing is a great example of strong voice. Her honesty and vulnerability resonates on each page and is truly admirable."
3,for begginers,"the book has a beatiful introduction, in which the author tells her personal experience in childhood and youth (her father was a writer, and it was not very simple to understand this kind of job)i'm not a religious person, and sometimes i feel the author is hiding something about herself, behind words ont faith. but maybe i'm being too skeptical.as a guide for writers, it is really for begginers.she seems to consider writing mostly as a human way to deal with feelings and pain, not necessarily an art."
3,Instructive Memoirs,"As an aspiring writer, I found Bird by Bird to be one of those books constantly recommended to me.Though a little self-indulgent by nature, the writing is crisp and vivid. Anne knows how to put sentences together and pull instructive material out of her own life experiences. I would categorize this book as ""Writing Inspiration"" alongside On Writing by Stephen King. There is some information regarding technique, but the majority of the book is filled with anecdotes and exhortations.Those looking for more technical instruction on the craft of writing fiction would be better served by something like ""Techniques of the Selling Writer"" by Dwight V. Swain."
5,Just write. Period.,"Bird By Bird by Anne Lamott is a truly enjoyable read covering everything she knows about writing. There seem to be more books than comprehendible on how to write, but none are as honest as this book is. She talks about the S#*!!@ first draft that we all know we write and so often stops us. Her bottom line is: be honest and simply write - every day - write. She even has a whole chapter on school lunches. I never thought about how much a school lunch tells us about a person, but now that she mentions it...A quote she gave by Flannery O'Conner doesn't let any of have the excuse not to write, ""Anyone who survived childhood has more material than can be covered in a lifetime."" The other gem I will take is her 1 inch frame that we look through to see what we will write about. So often we are overwhelmed and between that and our terrible first draft, we sadly stop writing. I would give this book 5 stars and will read it again."
2,OK.,"This is a book about writing. Ms. Lamott's dad was a professional writer and that's the profession to which she aspired as a kid and has, as an adult, attained. The problem is that at a soul level she seems to have little about which to write. Thus, the book covers one's lifestyle for writing (what time of day, and other tips to get one ""in the flow,"" so to speak, of writing). It seems that her answer to writing is write, keep writing, and write some more, and eventually some stuff will come out that you and maybe others like. Her problem is, again, that she struggles with: about what do I write? Her default is to write autobiography, basically, because she seems to have little else to say. So you have form without substance. My opinion obviously is that if you have substance (soul stuff, philosophy, a lesson learned that you seek to teach, etc.), then the writing simply flows from this."
5,Interesting and Informative,"I expected this book to be informative and was not disappointed. The fact it was also entertaining was a bonus. The author's empathy for other writers was refreshing, as well. I appreciated the many tips sprinkled throughout and would recommend this book to anyone who likes to write."
1,Writing or Group Therapy?,"For writers? I don't think so. This hodge-podge of ""how do I feel today"" stuff is really for the weak of mind who can't handle the notion that writing is a craft, not a group therapy session. Most often, Lamott references movies, NOT BOOKS, to make the points that her insipid writing cannot capture."
2,"Funny, Occasionally Obnoxious, but Never Dull","I think she could have written the actual writing advice in half this book, but at least she did the rest (partial autobiography) in an entertaining way. The first section and the last chapter were the best, but the other parts...were...what...? She urges the reader to write about one's childhood, but what if the aspiring writer doesn't want to begin at this point? Lamott lost me once she started describing character and plot...maybe, I'm just not that smart but she spoke in concepts and I just didn't click with her style. Found Julia Cameron more useful."
1,Self-indlugent trash for the self-preocupied.,"If you are a writer haunted by self-doubt and keep battling the daemons that haunt your ego, this book might give you a couple of insights on how to start writing. There are some useful tidbits for the rest of us, but these are difficult to find, and force you to read the rest. You will find no guidance as to creating a better plot, or characters, as the chapter names would lead you to believe.I expected a book like ""Structuring Your Novel: From Basic Idea to Finished Manuscript"" from Meredith and Fitzgerald, but with a personal spin. But instead I got some new-age drivel. Its nice to see that the author found solace and escape in her writing (and if you believe the description of the accompanying video, other things), but I wished she would have given us more of a book on writing then one on her personal pains."
1,A surprising disappointment,"Wow. I so disagree with so many of the reviews. Though well written itself, I found the book meandering and without purpose, certainly not living up to the sub-title, ""some instructions on writing and life."" Better writing books abound, and as for instructions on life, well, all it inspired in me were periodic eyeball rolls.Natalie Goldberg lite. And I realize the irony."
5,Excellent writing inspiration,"Early in my dissertation process, my advisor had me read ""Bird by Bird."" I did not want to read it -- after all, it was not related to my dissertation research in the slightest. However, I did as my advisor instructed. Oh my gosh! This book was very inspiring to me -- it helped me to begin writing my dissertation. I learned to write, write, write...and then go back and discard all of the garbage. This book really helped me to get the writing process going."
4,not for writing teachers---,"This is really a quick, easy book to fly through. It has a lot of funny tidbits about the process of writing. Ms. Lamott deals with the importance of plot, characters, dialogue, setting, and everything else that relates to being a writer.However, if you are a teacher who is looking for a guide to use in your classroom, this won't help you at all. The main message she is trying to convey is that all of us have experiences worth writing about, and all of us have the ability to put them on paper. This is just a book that helps you see the stages one must go through to get from A to Z."
5,Very Useful and Funny!,"I found this book to be very inspiring. Ms. Lamott gave suggestions on writing and shared her knowledge, and I found it very useful. This book is also very funny and light and a quick read. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to write or needs advice on writing, because I think it is an excellent source of information."
5,One of the best non-fiction books ever written!,"I loved this book so much I ordered the hardcover version and sent my paperback off to another aspiring writer! I'm not much of a non-fiction reader, but I happened upon this in my closet just as I was beginning to focus on freelance writing--I had no memory of buying it--and started reading, hoping it would inspire me. Not only did it inspire me to write, but it was so engaging that I could barely put it down! Anne Lamott is witty and honest, and more than a little wicked, like your ideal best girlfriend...or the writing instructor you dream about! If you're looking for instruction, this is not your book. But if you're in need of inspiration, encouragement, or a little voice to say, ""Hey, lighten up!"" you'll definitely find it here!"
5,Almost perfect!,"I'm a new writer, and this book was recommended to me. What a delight! The author combines superb practical advice on the craft and art of writing with wonderfully wry asides on the emotional tempest that so often accompanies it. And in the middle of it all she had me laughing out loud. You're a treasure Anne Lamott!"
5,Worthwhile read,"I would describe this book as enjoyable fiction rather than a text book.There are loads of better books on the technicalities of writing.I still think this is a worthwhile read as it actually inspires you to get off your butt and write - which many a writing text book fails to do.I can imagine reading it more than once - whenever I needed a push to write. It just makes writing seem possible, less daunting."
4,Lets you know that you're normal,"Anne Lamott took the bold step of telling what she goes through as she writes and seeks publication -- thereby letting every writer know that he or she is indeed normal. We worry that our drafts stink, that we won't get published, that someone else's book will sell better, that we'll be remaindered within six months. Meanwhile; she slips in gentle encouragement for going forward anyway with your stinky drafts, so you can turn them into something worth printing and binding."
5,"Better than ""Writing Down the Bones""","Straightforward and humorous inspiration. Lamott is honest and isn't afraid to be a little ugly. If you read it once you'll likely read it again. However, this isn't a ""How to Write"" book. If you're looking for writing instruction, there are better choices. If you want to know that you aren't alone in your quirky writing life, pick this book up."
5,More Than a Starter Book,"Three years, two books, and umpteen articles ago, I entered the crazy world of writing. My agent suggested I read Bird by Bird. Her recommendation was a gift.Ann Lamott shares the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of writing, and she does it with incredible humor. I would not use some of the vocabulary she does, but it works for her. She is obviously a unique individual, and she calls it like she sees it.After my first book was published, I pulled out Lamott's book and read it again. The second reading was even more enjoyable than the first because I had a frame of reference to build on. One of these days, when I need a treat, I'll read it again."
2,Advice from a self-absorbed neurotic,"Anne Lamott's book has some useful advice for writers. Unfortunately, this could be summed up in about 500 words. The rest of the book is supposed to contain profound and insightful advice on life. I suppose whether you like this will all depend on whether you want advice from a self-absorbed neurotic. I would suspect that if you are fairly well adjusted and can deal with life's ups and downs with dignity, you will find the author becoming more and more annoying as you progress through this book."
2,"Emotionality, no meat","Besides being an English Lit. major and spending large dollars for ""writing books"" and a ""wall of fame"" with all of the diplomas, this much-lauded book butts the rear-end of the caboose. Inspirational maybe, good writing - yeah perhaps, but no cigar. If you need inspiration or minor spiritual development, go for it. But beware, 'cause you may feel even more neurotic after reading it! If you prefer practical, meat and potatoes advice, don't bother with this book."
1,Bird by Bird. Some instructions on Writing and Life,"I was happy to spot this book on amazon.com as I dream to become a very, inecredibly famous writer one day. The title also intrigued me as the play on words ""bird by bird"" in the title was a great idea. However, the book itself dissapointed me. How an experienced writer, someone who teaches other how to write could use the word ""writing"" 5-6 times on half of the page? There is also an overwhelming feeling of ...depression and sadness almost on every page...The author underlines it everywhere that writing is difficult and will bring nothing but unhappiness to the unwise person who will undertake such an dangerous and devastating task. It is a mixture of personal history (sad one) and some tips on writing.Unfortunately not my type of book."
5,Most Helpful Book on Writing I Know,"I've been a publishing fiction writer for over twenty years and been teaching fiction writing for almost twenty. When I discovered this book ten years ago, I seized on it as a work to use in class, but it's become increasingly important in my life and work as well. When I teach, I ask my students to read it the first week of class so that they can hear the things I want to tell them in a funnier and more congenial voice than I can muster, and we refer back to it all semester long. Whenever we talk about it, I'm reminded not only of the great lessons about writing Annie has enclosed, but about the truths about the writing life we find here: the act of writing is more important than publishing, and striving to be a good person is more important than either."
1,Time and money is better spent elswhere,Very little writing advice. This is more about the authors feelings an experiences than any thing else. Her fathers advice to his son writing a book report about birds is the best part of the book. The worst is her telling you to give male characters three inch penises.
2,A Rehash of Another Author's Book,"I can't believe that no one else has recognized that Bird by Bird is nothing but a rehash of Brenda Ueland's book, If You Want to Write--A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit. Only Ms. Ueland did it so much better--back in the 1930's. The original author teaches us how to write--without all the self-serving rhetoric of the copycat.Grab a copy of If You Want to Write--get the real McCoy."
4,Entertaining But Slight,"Bird by Bird is an instructional guide on writing with a good helping of life on the side. The title ""Bird by Bird"" is taken from her father's advice to her brother who was agonizing over a book report on birds: ""Just take it bird by bird."" Lamott's suggestion on the craft of fiction is personal and pragmatic: worry about the characters, not the plot, getting rid of jealousy, the anticlimax of publicaiton, etc. She wisely advises writers to form support groups pieced together with family, friends, and other writers. She observes that sometimes you won't get good support from writing groups, but you'll need them to keep your sanity.If you are looking for hard core advice on writing, you may find this book a bit slight. Some of the chapters are only a few pages in a small format book. But if you are looking for entertainment, diversion while you are stuck in your own writing, inspiration, the word on the path taken, this is the book for you."
3,Not quite my cup of tea.,"I like the concept of making weight loss more of a spiritual journey, but Chumley's religious approach is a little more than I can accept. I think if you are really at rock bottom regarding your weight, or if you are quite religious to start with, this book is more likely to be helpful to you. On the plus side, it is simple to understand, concise and well-written. Not a bad read, and has some helpful bits even if you're unable to accept the entire book as a new way of life."
1,Not What I Expected,I thought this book was the personal journey of the author's weight loss. The text goes on spiritual and New Age tangents. I am sorry I bought it.
4,A Good Book,This is a good book but I personally could not lose weight this way and actually gained weight eating less but more often. I think people like me with a very slow metabolism are more likely to benefit from other types of weight loss methods. This is the way I finally lost fifty pounds and I have kept it off for about five years now and I wrote my own book about it!The Number One Secret To Permanent Weight Loss: The Last Book on Dieting and Weight Loss You Will Ever Need.
1,Worst floor cleaner I've ever used,"I purchased the starter kit, and before I could finish the 4 pads that came with it the handle broke. I didn't abuse it either. It seems like not all parts of the pad touch the floor. I squirt the solution, mop and I can see that parts of the floor had solution smeared on it, and other parts where still dry. Then, when I'm done mopping the floor, I can do it all over again. This is the worst floor cleaner I have ever used. I miss my Swiffer!"
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this video. There was not enough introductory stuff for the beginner and basically no useful information for an advanced caster. White says in the beginning of the video he will teach you how to be a more efficient caster. This will reduce the amount of false casting you need. That was it! He didn't mention how to reduce false casting at all. In fact, 99% of his casts were false casts! If you are even an intermediate caster skip this video. And try one from Lefty Kreh."
3,Wisconsin Cheeseman 1 lb. Holiday Cookies,Looked and tasted store bought. Disappointed in quality for the price - $25 for l lb.
1,gasket was wrong,"I don't know what I received, but it was not the right gasket for my car. I went to a local auto parts store and got the right part immediately. The part number there was the same as this one."
2,A one dimensional story,"All the characters in this book are very one dimensional. You ""see"" what they do and ""see"" where they live, but you don't get much below their surfaces. The American couple is stereotypically unable, and unwilling, to assimilate with the ""foreign"" culture around them and the animosity between the cultures, in my opinion, never gets resolved. The wife's character develops as close-minded and neurotic instead of sympathetic. I felt the book was a visual essay that put me in the location, but wouldn't let me talk to anyone! I finished the book wishing I knew more about the lives and motivations of everyone in Ibarra."
4,enjoy the read,"This is a nice, relaxing read. It's easy to get through, and can be read in spurts is need-be.The Evertons are interesting emigres from the US. It makes you think about what in a location can make you happy. It also leads to interesting thoughts on how it would be to live in a foreign country.The book jumps around a bit, but the characters come to life. This ia a book in which I would recommend investing the time."
5,Outstanding work of art it took a lifetime to create,"Ms Doerr did not start writing until she was well into the golden years of her life, and the wait was oh-so-worth it. She has taken her experience in Mexico and written a book that makes you wonder why you live such an uncomplex life. I keep a copy in my library and revisit it annually to remind me of what great reading is supposed to feel like."
2,Slow...,"Is really the best way to describe this book. There is no readily identifiable plot to the novel. Aside from the colorful descriptions of Mexico (which certainly adds something to the text), there is really little entertainment value in this read. If you are looking for a fictional escape, this one deserves a pass."
5,"One Of The Greatest, and Most Underrated Books of Our Time","How could a person NOT love this book? By the novel's end we can almost feel, smell, and taste the isolated town of Ibarra. Intelligent and beautifully written, Doerr's tale is at times hysterical, enigmatic, poignant, heartbreaking, and beautiful. To read this story is a captivating experience, and when Sara Everton takes the final look at her empty home, one cannot help but join in her tearful plea: ""Bring, stones!"""
1,Poor build quality,"Like another reviewer on this page I had the same experience with not receiving the two year warranty card. But, now it is oast two years and the stem bezel (for adjusting the time and date) has broken and does not screw in to seal the unit. Now I'm stuck with an expensive and not very water resistant hunk of metal. If Tag wants to sell watches in this class they should guaranty them against manufacturing defects for the life of the watch."
2,average,"In my opinion,Mr.Hilton has a great literature talent,but I don't believe that he completely understood or understands Ayrton.There are just too many contradictions in his telling mostly because he himself wasn't sure what Ayrton ment when he said or done something.Mr. Hilton is a great writer but not so great psychologist."
5,Absolutely invaluable information,"This is a wonderful book full of rich detail. As a layman, I found it daunting at first, and needed to get out my algebra book to go with it, but the effort was well worth it. Fogg does a good job of capturing the science, the issues, and the wonder of Terraforming."
4,It was pretty good,There were a couple of versions of Majick that were alright but the Stateside remix of it made the single. It is incredible.
4,perfectly good mouse,"This is a good mouse, if you still use them. It works exactly as described, I've never had a problem with it. I recommend it, no problem."
5,Criminally Underrated Organist,"I would hazard a guess that very few people have even heard of this guy with the face of a 10 year old but he is really an unsung hero of the Hammond organ.His sound is very different to that of Jimmy Smith, Larry Young or Jimmy McGriff, for example, and can really swing a good solo.His sidemen are second to none. Grant Green (despite recording seemingly hundreds of albums for Blue Note) remains a neglected virtuoso and has a more edgier guitar tone on this session than the later stuff.Fred Jackson is another non-entity on tenor sax but deserved everything a great session like this gave to him (i.e. more recognition).Drummer Ben Dixon is solid and really swings hard. Name any other sessions he appeared on?All in all, a fantastic listen. This is jazz playing at its finest with a great production sound to match. Also good as a conversation piece (i.e. ""Who the hell is this guy?"" ""Well....."")."
4,A Blue Note Gem,"This album swings. It's a great thing that Blue Note finally gave this album the RVG treatment (it was looking for a while like the expensive import was the only way to go). Though there's not much of an argument that Jimmy Smith was the master of the jazz organ, there are other key players that definitely deserve your attention as well. Enter ""Baby Face"" Willette. It was on Grant Green's Blue note debut (Grant's First Stand) where I first heard his playing and he was really the star of that disc for me. A great underrated musican who only made two albums for Blue note as a leader. Green returns the favor on this disc, as well as drummer Ben Dixon. Definitely pick this up, and the Grant Green disc, especially the track ""Miss Ann's Tempo.""Now if only Blue Note would release Grachan Moncur III's Evolution...."
2,Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover,"Being a fan of Tiki and intrigued by the stunning cover art by Mark Ryden, which also graces the cover of the wonderful Martin Denny CD compilation ""The Exotic Sound of Martin Denny"", I was hoping for more of the same in a coffe table book form. What I got was a rather thin book with poor quality color printing that loses a lot of the details of the orinal art. I would not have bought this book if I had the chance to look at it first."
5,Ill read it backwards; its that good!!!!,I happened to see an advertising for this book on Tbone's website and was curious. This book is fantastically layed out and is humorous to people of all ages. Recommend it to anyone!!!
4,Much better than the 3DS version,"This is a fun brick-breaking game that is sort of a combination of Arkanoid and Pong, with various powerups and hazards thrown in. This isn't quite a 5-star game, but there's enough variety and fun here to keep you coming back for more for a while.For what it's worth, I played this version before the 3DS one came out, and I didn't like the 3DS one."
2,"This is really for babies, not toddlers","The first thing that should be noted about this book is that is really intended for babies, not toddlers. The games are for children from 12 to 24 months. I bought it for a 2 1/2 yr. old and he's pretty far beyond many of the suggested games. For a younger kid, it would be pretty good. All the games feature stuff that's laying around the house and they are very short games, which is great for kids with an attention span of about 2 seconds! I would recommend this book for anyone with a baby, but be forewarned there's a lot of gushy stuff in there like ""sit back and watch your little cherub have fun!"""
5,The best activity book for toddlers 12-24 months,"I really like this book a lot! It doesn't require me to go out and buy a bunch of craft supplies- Jackie Silberg just gives basic, simple ideas of games and activities for my 17 month old. Are the ideas revolutionary? Well, no... but it really has helped a clueless mom like me just come up with some things to do! Sometimes when you are home with a baby all day, you start running out of ideas. It is nice to have a simple reference book for times like these. Some items in the book are: ""cook"" with your baby by shaking apples with cinnamon and sugar in a plastic container, make pop up toys, open junk mail, etc."
2,"There are better options available to you,","It's not a bad book, there are just better better options, I enjoyed the following and use as a reference:The Encyclopedia of Infant and Toddler Activities: Written by Teachers for Teachers. I will be donating this book to the local library rather than packaging and making a trip to the UPS store to return."
1,Disappointing,"I was diappointed in this book. I expected a whole bunch of ideas for simple games. What I got was a book which spells out what we already do with our daughter.The ""games"" consist of things as obvious as pointing to a toy and naming it then having your child point to their toys as you name them. I mean, who doesn't know to ask thier child ""Where's your kitty toy?"" or doing this little piggy with them.Those are not ""games"" so much as simply interacting with your child. And I certianly don't need a book to tell me to do that!"
4,Classy Brazilian jazz-vocals set,"Jazz-tinged, soft-pop Brazilian music from the underrated singer-composer Fatima Guedes (who has been recording since the late 1970s). Most of the songs are her own compositions, although several were co-written with other jazz-MPB stars, including Ivan Lins and Djavan. Djavan contributes fine duet vocals on one of two songs he co-wrote, ""E Serio,"" which is an album highlight. If you like mellow, measured, mature smooth-jazzish Brazilian vocals, this is an album you'll want to check out.Songs include:1 Muito intensa2 Grata3 É sério (duet with Djavan)4 Namorado5 Desejo6 Corpo mestio7 Dois amores8 Ultramar9 Muito obrigada10 Perfeito (duet with Zé Renato)11 Sete véus(DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
5,"great league, great dvd","It's just a great dvd, you can have no knowledge of the cape league and still enjoy this dvd."
3,Great item but packed poorly by Amazon,"After the previous poor reviews and shipping problems Amazon had encountered with this item you would have thought they would have been more cautious with the packaging. Unfortunately, they weren't. If you purchase - double your order - that way you have a chance of getting about half that aren't broken and you can return the broken items like I ended up doing. Some were shattered, some had hairline cracks so inspect them very carefully upon receipt. Amazon doesn't provide a phone number for complaints. Good Luck!"
3,Lovely but fragile,"I adore the shape of these bowls, but find them to be incredibly delicate; one has already cracked at the hole and a spoon has broken beyond mending. They also conduct heat a bit too well for eating utensils; perhaps a more durable material for the next set?"
3,Trying to do some oriental,"A very nice set. Unfortunately I ordered 2 sets (4 bowls) and received 1 1/2 sets (3 bowls, and some shards). Very poor packaging in the shipping box resulted in the destruction of one of the bowls. Everything else survived intact. I'm currently seeking recourse from amazon.comAmazon was VERY quick to offer a prepaid return label and shipped another set out via FedEx next day.Unfortunately, the next set also had a damaged bowl.Citing ""problematic"" shipping problems, amazon refused to ship another set. They did offer a $10 certificate, refund and return shipping label, but none of them have appeared yet after 5 days (a weekend was in there).I'll tell you the definition of ""problematic"". Each shipment was received (in oversized boxes) with the bowls' containers laying on the bottom of the carton, and lot's of packing on top. Would it be too hard to pack the bottom, top and sides of the product?"
3,"Nice bowls, cheap packaging","I purchased these as a gift for a friend. After seeing a similar set of noodle bowls on a pricey website with high shipping, I checked Amazon to see if I could find something similar, but more affordable.The bowls arrived unbroken, but the packaging is tattered, scuffed, and generally in poor condition.In addition, the packaging is bright yellow, cheap cardboard, with a tacky label. Hard to explain, but it looks like it was pulled from a clearance rack at a very cheap discount store.The bowls themselves are nice - matte black stoneware, nicely weighted, simple and pretty. If you are purchasing for home use, this is all that really matters, right?If you are purchasing as a gift, however, realize that the presentation is anything but classy! I now plan to repackage them in a gift basket with a cookbook and a few kitchen gadgets in order to make them presentable. So much for saving money!"
2,Organization is a Problem,"The textbook contains a great deal of relevant basic information on politics in Western Europe. Unfortunately, it needs to be better organized. This goes for the organization of chapters and organization within the chapters. I used it in my Western European Politics class, but students did not respond favorably. The textbook sometimes picks up a topic without any obvious reason for doing so, and then, having said a few sentences about it, leaves it off, also without any obvious reason. This makes individual chapters hard to follow."
5,Great Fun! Great party toy for teens/college age,"Last year, I gave this Hog Wild Snowboard Play Set to my college son as part of a finals week ""care"" package. Like me, he has great fun with Hog Wild's stuff. And he's a snowboarder, so I thought he'd get a kick out of the set. He recently told me that this set has been a great hit with his friends when there's a party at his apartment. He says every party, they ask him to get it out so they can play snowboard while they're sitting around talking. He's surprised by what fun they have with it--both guys and gals."
2,Bizarre Fantasy,"This story was a good notion, but the story line and plot were weak. If you like almost sci-fi children's books, go ahead."
5,"Awesome, Uber cool style statement","Nike Mettle Sledge is the uber cool style statement in watches. Best for daily use, casual use, party wear. Its a really well designed watch, enhancing your looks."
4,Great Collection of Old-Time Comedy,"This is a very funny view of comedy from the past. This is from a time when the imagination of the radio listener was essential to the humor, the slapstick of Vaudiville had to adapt to a new media. The only warning from me, the W.C. Fields material on Disc 1 is taken from the Decca anthology from the late 60s and not radio material as is the rest of this Box Set. All in all it is well worth the small amount for 4 CDs."
1,You have to be kidding on the price!!,"The interview is fine, but $17.95 for 12 MINUTES?!!! Come on Amazon! I know this is an 'on demand' DVD, but really!"
1,waste of money,"dont buy it, it seriously doesnt give you anything. just capitalize on the work of a good man. keller says something interesting: all things being equal the chef that buys that better products wins! there you have it."
3,Nice but...,I really like Leap Frog toys and my sons have a lot of them. I must say thought that this guitar was a bit of a disappointment. I thought that they would play with it much more but they got bored with it quickly.
1,no ok,My 3 year old wanted a real guitarwe returned it as he did not like thishe said it was for babies
3,LeapFrong Learn & Groove Guitar,"Not so crazy about this guitar. It's a pretty good educational toy, but not much of a guitar if that's what you were aiming for. The shape is about all that is guitar-like. They barely realize they are strumming a guitar for all the background stuff going on."
3,Five minutes of fun,My 13 month-old son played with this toy for about 5 minutes before walking away. He hasn't been interested in it at all despite my trying to engage him with it. It doesn't seem to have enough challenge to keep him interested.
2,"Not pleased, not bad, but one present that didnt make me happy.",This is LeapFrog and I thought that this was going to have more HandsOn playing but it doesnt.My grandson's Back Yardigan Guitar has more button with more lights and more music.I am not even sure if the strings work or even make fake music. I was really disappointed
5,A good music toy,"I intended to buy this guitar for my 6 month old baby, but it turns out that her 6 year old sister also loves it. The big sister often plays the guitar and the younger one laughes and kicks her feet to rymth with the music."
4,"Fun, but gets annoying quick","We've had this guitar for about a year now. It's cute enough, but the phrases get really annoying after a while. Every time my son spins the dial, it says ""Let's jam!"". That was OK the first 40 times, but does it have to say this every time?? I also wish the animal sounds were a little more realistic and that it had a few more modes of play. OK for the money though."
5,My twin 17 mos old LOVE this toy,"I have 2 17 mos old boys, and they both absolutely love this toy. I am not one for taking time to write reviews, but had to recommend this toy. One of my sons is in love with this toy more than the other son, he'll pick it up play it and rock out (head bobbing, foot tapping, the whole bit!). Both boys know how to use it easily, and have been playing with it since 12 mos old. They both like it more for the music aspect than the educational (animal noises) aspect. It has 3 song tracks (they have their favorite) and can play in English or Spanish, which is great in our house where we speak both. Nowadays I ususually have one on guitar and the other on xylophone."
2,Wasn't impressed at all,"Bought this for my sons first birthday. He seemed to love it the first couple of days, but doesn't touch it now. My two year old is the same way.I don't claim to know what kids want, but this thing doesn't have many useful options. We've owned many different toddler toys in the music category and this one seems to have the least options.I wouldn't recommend unless you're in the market for multiple music toys."
2,disappointment,"A big disappointment for the price. The machine has plenty of speed, but no consistancy with the pitch. It may throw a perfect pitch one time and the next throw one at your feet or way over your head. The only thing that it is good for is outfield practice, but for the price who would want it just for that?"
2,I wish someone had been honest - almost a good machine.,I bought this machine because I thought it would be safer for kids (durafoam balls) and because I read a lot of good reviews on it. All the reviews though were by people selling the machine.I am very dissapointed for the following reasons.1) Durafoam balls are rock hard and hurt worse than a baseball.2) Balls curve even in straight fast ball mode.3) Very inconsistant pitching4) Machine vibrates so much machine vibrates out of set position.5) Adjustments are small hand knobs clamping smoothe metal against smoothe - you can't get them tight enough to stay put.I'm glad I got this for a good price because I think I'm going to turn right around and sell it. I am going to look at the Wilson/Atec Hitting Streak instead.
2,too inconsistent,This machine was too shaky and too inconsistent. Go with the Jugs Lite Flite pitching machine. It is a lot better than this one and it is only a few dollars more.
1,The claim to not cost you a ticket is obviously B.S.!,"I got pulled over and issued a $125 ticket for ""obstruction"" of a license plate - because two letters were blurry. I have been driving for 9 years and never received a ticket or citation for ANYTHING except this. I haven't tried the spray, but if it doesnt blur the letters it might be worth the investment. DO NOT BUY THE PHOTO BLOCKER COVER it's VERY OBVIOUSLY BLURRY - you almost have to FIND an angle that ISNT blurry - which is straight on......cops dont always ride behind you - they ride in your blind spot - with a clear shot of the blurry angle! Don't waste your money on this or it could cost you as much as 3-4 times as much. However, I guess I'd recommend it if you have received numerous red light tickets in the mail or you run redlights every day. I give this product a 1 out of 10 cuz for a Daily redlight runner, it'll cost you less per police issued ticket, than the cameras can spit out daily."
1,"Doesn't work, have a ticket to prove it","This cover doesn't work. The red light camera took a picture of the plate, and the license plate numbers were clear as day. The cover did not distort the numbers at all."
1,Lic Plate cover,"Film on inside of cover turned to a dark brown over time, became brittle, and I eventually had to rip of the layer or get a ticket."
2,Photo shield,"I don't actually know if it works...but I do know that it attracts as much attention from law enforcement as...lets say... covering your license plate with duct tape...or just removing your license plate alltogether. Photo shield might have ""slightly"" exaggerated the legality of their product. So if you want to add anywhere from 20 minutes to 3-5 years to your commute and or possible tickets. By all means try it out. Make sure everything else is squeaky clean though."
1,Agreed with other comments as to not working,"On an episode of ""Mythbusters"" on Discovery channel they tested these and found not to work most of the time, in fact the spray is completely worthless. Save your money. My friend got a $200 ticket for HAVING this on his car! Illegal in many states!"
2,Decent.........,"I have now used this knife for about a year and i would say it's decent at best. I don't care for the shine, if I'm in a public area and need a knife for somthing I like to keep a low profile but the shine almost draws attention. The lockup is O.K. when opened but don't put too much confidence in it because it will close if there's too much pressure on the spine. The pivot screw did loosen up on me easily which made the blade rest on the liner but with some blue locktite I was able to secure the pivot screw and center the blade. Since I used the locktite I must have opened it a couple hundred times and haven't had any issues with the pivot screw loosening any more. The blade does not keep an edge at all and needs constant sharpening after almost any use but you can get it razor sharp fairly easily.I have mine in the junk/tool draw now and only use it for small tasks. For the price it not horrible but it won't hurt to shop around a little"
4,N2F,Great knife for basic s***.... no serrated base so thats a minus.... and the bolt gets loose quickly... so have a special screw driver on hand to tighten that B up :)
3,Kinda OK...,"I thought this would be a good knife. Nope, sorry to tell ya, it's just average. You could get a better knife for five bucks. The reason why I'm saying this is because this knife is so...bulky. Slim knives are so much better. Also, the blade wears out easily, and the lockup has failed more than 5 times for me. The pocket clip has broken, and the tip has broken off. All this after only 3 months of use. I'll agree, I don't baby my knives, but I DO NOT abuse them. Get a Master Cutlery fixed blade if you really want to get your value. Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/Master-Cutlery-HK-106320-Outdoor-7-5-Inch/dp/B00178CS4K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337636327&sr=8-1. Hope this review was helpful."
3,Spun apart in the dryer,"I did not buy this on Amazon (and paid more for it....). I like the knife - compact, easy to open, clips inside jeans pocket. I left said knife in my jeans pocket and wife promptly washed and dried it. It spun a part in the dryer. I would expect a little more from an ""extreme op"" knife. I found all of the parts and screwed it back together but now have to go buy a tool to ensure it is tight."
3,Okay Knife,"The knife is solidly built, but relatively light weight because of the aluminum handle. The blade holds a decent edge with medium to hard use. The only thing I don't like about it is that the thumb post is located VERY close to the blade pivot center which makes it difficult to open single handed which makes it inconvienient. Over all a decent enough knife."
2,poor attention to detail,I bought this knife with an eye towards an everyday carry that had a slightly bigger blade than my usual preference. While this Smith and Wesson is slim and fits nicely in a pocket it is not constructed as well as some other brands' products in this price range. My biggest complaint is the that the blade does not lock into the closed position. The blade has opened on me while slipping the knife into my pocket. The point tore up a shirt that cost more than the Buck and that was the last time I carried the knife.
3,good knife,"i would recommend this:Smith & Wesson CK5TBS Bullseye Extreme Ops 4.1"" 40% Serrated Black Tanto Bladethe silver knife above is for use in the outdoors and more. the blade comes out easily , good for throwing , feels good in your hand.i have one complaint. the blade is so dull its crazy! today im feeling it and it wont cut paper , and you cant cut a twig anymore or anything strong anymore. i was satisfied with it the first few weeks , but then i gave to my brother as a starter."
2,"Sooooo junk, and over priced","Developed blade play in 1 minute, adjutment does not last. P.O.S . Like the aluminum handles though. Not a good buy, get mtech instead."
2,Is this really extreme ops?,Imagine you are in a fight for your life. Blood on your hands makes the smooth shiny handle slippery. Wouldn't you want a knife with a rough rubber handle?
1,Expected much better,"If I held this in my hand before, I never would have bought it.The blade is made in China, but that's probably the best part of the knife. Easily opens one handed, but a little too easy for a new knife. Does not come razor sharp but it has a decent edge.The aluminum handle is too thick and flat. If the handle seems beveled in pictures it's because of the pattern embossed on the handle. The clip at the back looks cheap and uninspiring."
3,I own better Mtech knives,"You are paying for the Smith and Wesson brand name. ""Extreme Ops""? Not quite. I knew this would be Chinese stainless steel and aluminum and wasn't expecting a perfect knife. But it took a lot of messing around with the T10 screws to get the blade to not wobble and lock into place. If I didn't have a T10 driver I would have considered this defective out of the box.Now that I have it working properly I can say I like the shape of the blade and the handle. I like its light weight. Unfortunately, the thumb studs on both sides of the blade are abrasive and make it wider than it needs to be. You only really need one of these, or save weight and put a small hole in the blade for one handed opening.Overall, I own similar cheapo Mtech knives that cost much less and didn't have to be adjusted to work properly."
4,Review,"This knife's got great look and feel. The screw holding the blade loosens with time, so you'll have to put some thread lock on it. Also the steel on the blade is quite soft - it's good enough for cardboard boxes, but that's about how far it'll go. Tried it on some copper wire, and the sharp edge got bent a little. Nothing a little sharpening won't fix, but the fact that it bent, and not just went dull shows just how soft it is. For the price though, I'm not complaining. And it's a good knife for a non-demanding everyday use."
5,Good Deal,knife is well made and a good deal. I never have liked that kind of blade latch but they seem to all have that kind these days.
5,Good Quality,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. Very good quality, size, and blade is sharp, all parts work great. I would recommend for anyone looking for a general utility knife to carry in their pocket."
4,Good Value,"I carried this knife around every day for 10 months and used it pretty much daily. I can tell you i got my $11 worth and more. It is a great looking knife, very sleek. It worked great, stayed pretty sharp and held together. I love that is light and not bulky yet just heavy enough to feel solid. The blade comes out quickly and easily with a flip of the thumb or flick of the wrist. Once it is out the blade locks into place securely. After almost a full year of daily use the belt/pocket clip did come a little loose. The knife might slide out of my pocket now so it's time for a replacement. I would recommend this knife to anyone especially at this price."
3,Exhaustive,"These people love their research, and they do a credible job of singing the songs. The music is what you'd find at a coffee shop -- pretty much sounding all the same after an hour. The style is definitely Western, i.e. not as much influenced by Scots-Irish or Appalachian styles as it is by the 1930s folk singers like Guthrie."
5,Easy for a non-techie to understand,"I'm very pleased with the service, price and product. Needed the extra long cable when I got my DSL installed and was able to find it pretty easily, even though I'm not terribly technical."
4,check out charlie on shake dat booty,"shake dat booty was great towards the middle to the end, love at your fingertips, closin the gap are the best songs"
3,A little rushed?,"Without giving away any major spoilers, parts of this book really disappointed me. I feel that the plot overall seems a little rushed - events happen without much description or detail. The ending is very vague, with no preview of the cover for the next book. And who knows when we'll see the next Ragnarok - there's no release date from tokyopop!"
4,great job,"the first fantasy story I actually finished. Overall the story is great. There is a lot of tension in the book, and brings out a lot of emotion out of you. You do connect while reading the book, and really get into it. Although I did find the final confrontation was a bit lacking, and somewhat anticlimatic. (or even some of the events leading up to it, I'd just like to see a##kicking from time to time)Some parts of the story arent as well explored as they shouldve/couldve been, such as certain characters and their inner world, as well as the overall betrayal theme in the story. Overall this book is excellent, but just missing a tad bit of something that I found when reading Belgariad."
2,"starts with potential, but ultimately disappointing","Lynn is a talented writer and is capapble of great characterization and evoking compelling, heart-wrenching emotion. The problem with Dragon's Winter I felt was that there was not enough perspective from Tenjiro or Karadur. Their rivalry is simplified and never explored. The main characters of this novel could arguable be Wolf, Thea, and Hawk, but their plot lines are ultimately dissatisfying, good in parts, never sufficient to bring it all together. I was hoping for so much more."
2,"Disappointing. Lynn tries to tell too many stories,","I was disappointed in this new book from Elizabeth Lynn. I was so happy to see that she is writing again, but this book does not hold a candle to her earlier novels. I found it disjointed; Lynn tries to tell too many stories, none of them satisfactorily. Just as I became engrossed with one set of characters she dropped them to focus on another group. She attempts to give depth and background to each of these people by off-hand references to earlier events in their lives, but this is more annoying than tantalizing. Perhaps she needed to make this into two or three books."
1,Where's all the action!!!!!,"A massive disapointment! The fact that none of the main characters were safe from Lynn's overkill habit, meant that I could not settle in to the story. The whole book is a huge build up to something you expect to a a massive climax. There is almost no action through out, and the final struggle seems nothing more than a skirmish. Sorry, but I need action in my heroic fantasy."
3,NOT TOO BAD,"The whole tenet of this book is that envy doesn't pay, in the end it will eat you up. Twin brothers were born,Karadur with the dragon blood and Tenjiro without. Tenjiro wants what he can't have and turns to evil sorcery to obtain it. Ms. Lynn writes a good fantasy but is a little heavy handed with her violence. I can't really say that the ""hero"", Karadur the Dragon, is any better than his brother as he mindlessly kills his friends with his dragon anger. The ending is less than fulfilling also."
4,WHY?,"WHY! why did my fav. character die! Well, you're not getting a name from me...nope. I think this book was very good. It was the first Lynn book i have read. I'm just waiting for the sequel (or has it came out yet?) i had bought it in the summer and didn't have a chance to read it until a few months ago. I read it in two days, i just couldn't put it down. It gets u involved. I think Lynn could have elaborated on the characters a little more, but other than that...it was a great book. A MUST READ!"
3,Where's the Sequel,"I thought this was a pretty good book. I did dislike the massive amount of gore and the fact that the best character died, but it's a good story that you want to follow. What disappoints me is, I have heard nothing of a sequel of any sort. The book just leaves you hanging, wondering what happens next. Are there any more dragon changelings or is he the last one? Where'd the story go...?"
3,There are better Peanuts books out there,"I remember reading and loving the paperback Fawcett collections of Peanuts comics as a child, mesmerized by the great strips in them. So I snapped this up when I saw it recently, but it's just not as good as the ones I read as a kid. Maybe my sense of humor has changed a little, but not that much. I think there have to be better collections. For one thing, although Woodstock is on the cover, he does not appear in a single strip inside. There are a few cute dated references, and Linus does have glasses, but if you buy this one and aren't thrilled, don't give up on the genre--there are better ones out there, I'm sure!"
1,Impossible to Get On By Yourself,"This carrier is impossible to get on by yourself. Every time I wear it my husband needs to help me. In addition, no matter how tight we make it, the carrier and baby keeps sliding down. It doesn't support her head properly either. I would buy another one but the babies can use it for such a short time that it is not worth it to spend the money on a new one. 2009 - I am adding on that my daughter was injured by one of the clasps on the carrier and we got rid of it and replaced it with a new one."
5,Very Happy with this carrier,"We've been very happy with this carrier so far. We've only used it in the front facing position, but it's been great so far. The shoulder straps have excellent padding and neither me nor my husband have had any complaints about comfort. It hasn't rubbed or caused us any problems. As someone else mentioned, the straps are long enough incase you're not so slender. We've used this carrier on all day outings hand haven't had a sore back or shoulders yet (but then again, he's only 8 lbs right now!)Getting baby in and out is a breeze and can be done quickly. The materials seem durable and comfy.The hardest part of this carrier is the initial fitting. Even that wasn't too complicated. Just take your time sorting out the directions. We've been very happy with this carrier and would recommend it. The price is great as well!"
2,Not quintessential Wheeler,"If you love Cheryl Wheeler music, you'll likely be disappointed with this album. This is her first album to get relatively wide distribution, and it doesn't contain the style and songs or wonderful lyrics she is known for. There are a few good songs, such as Behind the Barn, Quarter Moon and Paradise in troubled Waters,but the rest disappoint. If you are a major fan you'll want it for your collection, but this is not quintessential Wheeler by a wide margin."
1,ipup,"I bought an ipup thinking it would be similar to an idog. boy was i wrong!you can't hook up your ipod to it, all it does is play a couple tunes andyou have to put it in front of a speaker so it can listen to music.I used it once and haven't since, i hope you don't make the same mistake and buy this!"
3,"Cute, fun for chlidren","My daughter LOVES this I Dog, but does grow bored of this quickly. It dances and moves and colors are all over the face, but other than that, it is already sitting alone on the ground. Cute, but not very interactive."
3,Pup is cute but should have gotten iDog with speaker,I got this for my nieces for christmas because they all did not have iPods. The pup dances to music. Would have been better to spring for the iDog so they could all hear the songs on the iPod.
3,"It's for the office, NOT the classroom.","I have found this dictionary to be of little use to me. Simple words like ""Decadal"" and a host of other words students' would search for are NOT in this book. Though the dictionary serves okay as a desk reference dictionary for most professionals, it will not work well for backpack-toting college and university students."
5,This book will help you get CLEP credit,"Test score 71 out of 80 - Achieved using this book, some previous study in literature analysis, and life experience.This book does not cover everything that you might encounter on the CLEP test for Freshman College Composition. The content covered will help you become familiar with the style and format of many of the test questions. I recommend some additional research on bibliography and passage analysis to complement and round out preparing for this exam. This book is a good value for the money. Get it - it will help you in your CLEP quest."
4,It really did help.,"The REA book helped a lot with preparing for the CLEP exam. The actual CLEP exam was much different from the practice exams in REA's book. It would help the study process if REA updated the three practice exams in the book, and included all three of those exams on the accompanying CD, instead of only the first two exams. An earlier reviewer pointed out that there were some errors in the REA book. I noted the same errors and found that there were several additional errors throughout the book. The CLEP book would benefit a lot from being proofread and from having the errors corrected. Overall, it is my opinion that the REA book is very helpful with passing the CLEP exam, and I highly recommend purchasing the book."
1,this item is a scam and its used for 70 dollars you'd be a moron to buy it,if you look at the top of who wrote that review it was the seller themself. for 100 dollars i got a brand new Hanns-g 21 inch LCD monitor which is also a flat screen 6 inch's bigger then this piece of junk and it has high definiton and the same kind of sun resistant glaring as this old piece of junk my mom just got one of these used for 20 dollars and i still say she got ripped off cause this item is utterly worthless. if i think 20 dollars is a rip off i'm going to heck laughing about 70 dollars when for 30 dollars more you get something to talk about. 30 dollars less for a used piece of junk with no high def and 6 inch's less is a joke. i got a 32 inch T.V. for 25 bucks. when something chargers less it also means its qaulity is less .
4,mildly entertaining,"These dramatizations are mildly entertaining if you do not have Poirot-Marple plot complexity expectations or expect the parts to be played by famous actors. In addition to being ""mysteries"" they are also good presentations of social customs in England about 100 years ago. Amateur historians or cultural anthropologists will thoroughly enjoy them."
3,Agatha Christie Hour set 2,"I found the series of disks, more like stage plays rather than actual movies.The settings seemed too staged.Although the plots were good in most cases, they lacked the real Agatha Christie stlye I have got use to.But they were certainly better entertainment that what is appearing on the television.You could tell these stories were not her best... but they are good value for money"
1,"boring, bad sets, bad cameras, lack luster",This is so bad! It's like watching 70's tv soap operas...and why would we want to do that. I think someone accidentally ordered too many DVD's and now has to un-load them. I think I'll look into a refund.
3,No Answers in Student Edition,"I bought this book for the Ranking Tasks. I didn't realizethere would be no answers in the book. I feel this should be statedin the description. I didn't buy it as student taking a class, I boughtit for my own use as a teacher. The book was sent in excellent condition."
4,It's About the Connection,"This book is not so much about steps or sequences, so don't expect to learn cool moves from it. It's more about what lays beyond the movement. A balance between two energies: feminine and masculine that is what creates that strong unforgettable connection between people in dance or in life.I recommend this book to anyone, either you are dancing tango or not; it's short and very easy to read. And if you don't find a nice dance technique suggestion in it, you might find something that would be applicable in your every day life in a relation with your significant one or friends, or colleagues at work."
3,Review of Military Small Arms of the 20th century.,"Actually I was being lenient with 3 stars... It is an incomplete work with HUGE gaps on vital basics, leaving out prominent manufacturers and models manufactured, and above all, grossly wrong on stats on some items. Mr Hogg needs to do a lot of further work before he can claim it to be a quality reference work of note."
3,Another goody,"Annoying that this one is in 2 parts, with a book and different storyline in between, but I am really being picky, as I love these books! End of this book pretty much MADE me purchase the next half! but it had to be done!"
4,Disappointed that the new version added words!,"If you were lucky enough to purchase this and the other books of this very unique children's series before 2000, then you got the version without words. I found this endearing because the books characters and the action taken by the little one reading the book needed no words to prompt him or her. Unfortunately the new version has words to accompany the pictures and kind of ruins it for me. Instead of ""Find the Duck"" it should be called ""Your Mommy will read the words and tell you where the duck is!"" And they also changed the size of the book (its now bigger and too heavy for the 2-4 age range of the book) and added color backgrounds to the covers. I still think the series makes a good gift."
4,Works like it's supposed to,"It does what it's supposed to do, connects the network for my xbox well. Works well with a home networking system."
5,Ethernet,Works great! Had the right length. Great connection speed. It was everything that I wanted. I'm having no problems with it!
1,Clearly NOT white :-(,"I ordered this cable specifically because it was WHITE.It has WHITE in the name of the product.The image looks white. The cable isn't. Its grey.There are lots of ""white"" things around it like thepacking slip that clearly are justified to be white.So I've been mislead and am not very happy .."
3,Light & Dark,"this cd isn't as good as i was hoping.. while there is definetley some talent on here.. the whole wierd vocals thing aggrivates me. sometimes it sounds like a girl, a boy or even a alien? the actual music is good and atmospheric... but dont expect to be impressed by the vocals."
3,Good book for reviewing biology,"This book gives you a good, but brief overview of the MCAT Biology and Verbal portions. It doesn't cover organic chemistry except to the extent that it overlaps with Biology.The expanations are brief and concise and contain only the most important principles for MCAT testing purposes. It does not give test taking strategy, and it does not give many examples (one per major biology area), but the questions it does give are of high MCAT intensity.I would recommend this book to two classes of people:1) Those who took biology some time ago and wanted to review for the MCAT with the important biology priciples.2) Those who have not taken biology and needed to take the MCAT in spite of this deficeincy."
1,The MCAT Biology Book,"This is an awful book for MCAT preparations, especially if you've taken a decent Biology course in college. There are by no means enough practice problems, maximum 10-11 questions at the end of each chapter, the material is far too simply described, and sparse. Reading a textbook is far more useful."
1,Lacking....,"This MCAT review text is deeply lacking compared to other preparation texts on the market. The presentation of the material is very rough and difficult to follow. For those who enjoy studying colorful text with diagrams, figures, bold keywords etc.. look elsewhere, this is not your book. (Might I suggestExamkrackers MCAT Biology (Examkrackers)Aside from the presentation, the quality and depth of the material is insufficient to be used as your sole guide in preparing for MCAT Biology. I daresay my middle school ""Life Science"" textbook contained more depth on some topics. Considering the price and the quality of alternate preparation texts, I cannot recommend this particular book."
3,The spirit was willing,"CCR as a trio had a spare sound that did breathe new life into some of their classic songs. While Tom Fogerty was greatly missed, John Fogerty does an admirable job on guitar holding the CCR sound together. I'd actually give this CD two stars for the sound quality. It's muddy, hissy and sounds like it was mastered from a 2nd or 3rd generation copy.If you're a hardcore CCR fan, the boxed set has this CD remastered and with superior sound. Additionally, the CD features two tracks not on this CD. Live in Europe proves that they were professionals to the end but The Concert (recorded for at an Oakland, California show for a television special)is far superior (The Concert also benefits from the remastering as part of the boxed set).Skip this one and go for one of their classic albums."
2,Classic Creedence but needs better sound tech,"while all of the classic songs were recorded, the sound was not good quality, sounding hollow and very unclear."
3,Average at Best,"This was the first of a couple of live releases for CCR and it was an unfortunate release. Recorded after back up guitarist Tom Fogarty left the band we're treated to just a quick run-down of hits. With the exception of the final number ""Keep on Chooglin'"" these songs say nothing new. If I remeber right no song broke 4 minutes except ""Chooglin'"", which ran about 14 minutes. However, it was a dumb song to begin with so isn't worth the time to listen.I would suggest you pass on this unless you're looking to round out your collection. Instead, just buy one of the many greatest hits collections out there. The sound will be of better quality and the music will be the same anyway."
3,We miss Tom!,"This is an interesting album in that it showcases how important Tom Fogerty was to the CCR sound. John does an admirable job of trying to hold down the guitar parts single-handedly on this recording, but the real feel isn't there. An interesting item for serious Creedence fans (I've got one), but not the best representation of the band."
2,"Clorox BathWand Refills, Cant find them (contact infor for clorox)",Upset you cant find refills like me!! Contact Clorox and tell them you have the Wand and need the refills.[...]
5,Clorox Bath Wand,The product is excellent...I have a few of these. Easy to clean otherwise difficult places to reach.
1,Waste of money!!!!,"Don't even bother buying this product; it's cumbersome and you will just be annoying yourself when you try to use it. I've given it many tries, and EVERY time I'm scrubbing with it, the head of it swivels upside-down!!! The idea behind the product is great, but execution is horrible."
2,Can't find refills,I love this product but I am not able to find refill heads. If I could find them would give this produced 100% but without finding them then it is worthless to me.Thanks you!Susanna Brady
5,Fabulous Christian Fantasy,"""As an avid reader and especially as a fantasy lover, I thoroughly enjoyed Bill Hand's ' The Oneprince '. It is a just a fun book to read and the allegory is wonderful. Only three authors have made me chuckle out loud while reading : Mark Twain, David Eddings, and Bill Hand. That's pretty impressive company. I am going to make sure that all three of my sons read this book and I am going to get several copies as gifts for friends who love fantasy. You can bet I'll be the first on the list to get any other books written by Bill Hand.."""
2,Not one of the best ...,"Like a number of other reviewers, I feel this one is similar to a number of other releases after this wonderful authors death, it's clear he hasn't finished / fine-tuned it. I've enjoyed it and to be honest, less- than-perfect Laymon is better than many other horror writers best stuff. If you're new to Laymon, try to go chronologically through his work. It's very enjoyable feeling it develop and following the various themes that he develops and periodically revisits. If you're a veteran, read this one, it's still pretty riveting."
2,Inferior Layman,"There's a reason why Layman didn't publish this book while he was alive. It comes across as a lot of ideas, many completely unrelated, awaiting the editing required to make them a cohesive novel. The whole thing starts out as a murder mystery concerning a teenage girl being terrorized by a cleaver wielding maniac who kills her boyfriend, then, half way through, this entire storyline is abandoned as we find ourselves mixed up with a police officer who may, or may not, be a vicious serial killer. The plot is fuelled by ridiculous contrivances and coincidences, and character behavior is unbelievable. Anybody familiar with Layman knows that his female characters will take all manner of insane risks in the pursuit of sex, but those in 'The Lake' go even one step further and frequently jeopardize the lives of all around them just for a quick shag with a good-looking stranger. Of course, the whole thing is compulsively readable, as Layman always is, but it's definitely a second rate effort."
2,"Lake starts solid, but eventually drowns in plot twists","I've been a fan of Laymon's for quite some time, but this book was definitely not one of this best. While the first half of the book is wonderfully written -- especially the segments chronicling the romance of teen temptress Leigh and her innocent prey, Charlie -- things eventually go terribly awry. There are a few too many plots unfolding at once, and more than a few details simply ring wildly false. (For example, a woman hangs in a hot tub and has sex several times with the new man in her life over the course of several days, and yet apparently at no point notices that the hair on his head does not match the rest of his furry body... which is a major plot point.) If you're a fan of Laymon's and insist on reading everything he writes, there are certainly worse books out there. But if you'd rather not tarnish your love of his better work, pass this one on by."
3,Typical Laymon,"The late Richard Laymon is, I must confess, one of my guilty pleasures. His books are the literary equivalent of a B movie. Plenty of gratuitous everything. Violence, sex, and general mayhem are the rule. The Lake is no exception. In this case, the protagonists are a mother-daughter combo(both hot, natch) who are targeted by not one, but two over-the-top killers. Think 70s and 80s horror movie types. Now lest you think I'm a snob or, even worse, a dilettante let me say here that I think Laymon was in on the joke. His easy prose and campy charm make for a quick paced and fun ride. Yeah, I know, it's not high art. But sometimes you just need mindless entertainment to unwind. You can't eat caviar every day. Once in a while you just want a good hamburger."
1,"Good elements, bad execution","Seriously, did someone else write this? I have read and enjoyed other Richard Laymon books. I got about 95% through the Kindle version and I just couldn't subject myself to more.I can't finish a book when it starts to feel like punishment.Some intriguing, suspenseful elements but tied together badly or not at all."
5,What the heck?,"This was easily the dumbest book I've ever read. I gave it five stars because I don't like to give negative reviews, but holy cow this book was beyond ridiculous. I've never read a book written by an adult with adult subject matters sounding like it was written by a first grader. And not the writing style per se, but the content. Totally childish. Over and over again I kept thinking ""how did this get published?"" How does a publishing house read this and think to themselves ""we have a winner!"" You may have to read this book just to see what I mean. And actually it will help you to enjoy better authors like Connelly, Baldacci, and Sandford even more. The Lake is like cleansing your palette so to speak. And don't we all need that now and then. Something totally lousy to help us appreciate the good stuff. If everything was outstanding you wouldn't know how truly good it was after awhile. So let's thank Richard for this ludicrous novel. See? I can find the positive in everything."
1,extremely unrealistic,"I have read books on vampires, various were animals, and zombies and yet, this is the most unrealistic book I have ever written. The character's reactions are completely unbelievable and the author jumps from one character's head to another without any break. It is very confusing to read and annoying on top of that. I also read Midnight Tour by this author and will say that it was an odd story line but not nearly as bad as this book. Even the title does not make sense to the story line."
2,"well written, but predictable","I read through a little over half of this book and gave it up because it dragged so badly. The times when you got pumped up and into it were so few and far between that the in betweens seemed endless and longwinded. Maybe because I'm a fan of Edward Lee I've gotten use to non-stop action and suspense that anything else is dull, but I don't think so.The ending was so predictable that when I decided to quit reading I jumped to the end to see who was ""the bad guy"".SPOILERYou have a killer who likes to take pictures of his victims, and you have a cop, who is close to the case, who likes taking pictures of his girlfriend in unusual poses.....HHHMMMM. Maybe a connection?I gave this 2 stars because it was well written and intelligent, unfortunately it was also dull and predictable."
3,Falls Apart Like A House Of Cards,"2 AND 1/2 STARSWhile it breaks my heart to give this book such a mediocre review, the laughable plot twists in the last third of the book leave me no choice. Having a police detective disguise his voice to his partner and his lover and get away with it is ridiculous. Coincidences stack on top of each other like hotcakes, and the only real suspense lies in the first half. There's even a scene where the phone line is cut and then a few chapters another character tries to use the phone and, guess what? It suddenly works!Laymon is a horror genius. You only need to read ""In The Dark"" or ""Island"" to realize that. But somehow when writing ""The Lake"", he got distracted and produced his poorest effort. New fans should start with his other work to get the real effect of his storytelling skills. Still my favorite writer, I'm saddened by this book."
2,"Not a big fan of Jean Rabe, but she's getting better.","This continues the story of ""Dhamon"" from the Age of Mortals books. As she does in her other books, Jean Rabe includes creatures and beasts not typically seen in the Dragonlance setting, but I wish she would focus more on character development and I'm not a fan of her general writing style, though she seems to get better with each book I've read."
1,Didn't fit,"I am sure that this battery is perfectly good, but it had an extra plastic piece that stuck out on the backside that would not allow it to slide into my computer."
5,An excellent cross-selection of crime and punishment,"This is a wonderful starting-point for research into the history of crime and punishment. It's a coffee-table sized book, and is chock-full of illustrations. Frankly, it's the illustrations you want to see when reading about a subject like this. There are photos and descriptions of torture implements, woodcuttings of torture chambers, and observers' accounts.This is not the stuff of pleasant dreams, but it is what thousands of people have experienced."
4,About DARK JUSTICE,DARK JUSTICE is a book for an older person. This book is about what they did to people in the Middle Ages and earlier. It tells what a person would suffer if he was a warlock or she was a which. Any crime that you could think of is in this book. It tells also what would happen to the person if he or she was to commit a crime. Usually it was a painful and slow death. This bood is definitaly for older people.
5,GORGEOUS BOOK!!!!!!!!,"""Rita Hayworth A Photographic Retrospective"" is such an amazingbook it's hard to put into words.I'm a huge Rita Hayworth fanand for a photo book of Rita to come out is a dream come true!Caren put this book together perfectly as only a true Rita fancould! Rita in technicolor is a real treat to behold!The photosreally speak for themself-The candids photos really show thereal woman behind the ""image"".This truly is the most GORGEOUS photo book I've ever seen!!!Anyone will love this book-If you love the golden age ofhollywood you'll love this book or if you just love photo booksthis is a book you would enjoy!Thanks for the Amazing book Caren!"
5,The greatest Rita book ever!,"As a lifelong fan of Rita Hayworth I have to say this is the best book on Rita. The pictures are tremendous and many I have never seen before. Caren gives us a fully rounded portrait of Rita--she does not ignore the unhappiness Rita suffered but unlike another book on Rita she does not paint Rita's life as one of unending misery. This book conveys the same sense of joy and thirst for life that Rita exudes in the best of her pictures and performances. So slip Cover Girl or Gilda in your VCR/DVD player, open up this book and enjoy!"
4,Nice unique ring,"This is a nice piece of jewelry. I bought it for my fiancee to replace one she lost and she was thrilled. It's easy to put on and take off because it sort of ""rolls"" but it doesn't ever fall off. It is true to size and very well made."
2,DANGEROUS! Choking Hazard! Looks Nice..... but only if you're just looking.,"Dangerous!! There are these dice sized pieces of plastic with barbs on the sides used to hold the cabinet/oven/and fridge doors on. These easily pop off when your child is trying to open the doors. I didn't figure this out in time and I had to dislodge one of these from my toddlers throat. VERY SCARY! I requested Little Tikes to recall the product and they did nothing.Other peeves include the difficulty opening and closing the doors and the stove and fridge are not deep enough. My daughter cannot put any of her pretend baking pans in the oven and everything falls out of the fridge. If price is all that matters to you, then you can't beat it, but I can't recommend this product because of its' safety issues."
3,"not best quality, but serves its purpose","the faucet doesn't move at all and my son was a little frustrated because he couldn't pretend to turn it on, but other than that it has been fun. some of the drawers don't open and the hooks where you hang the spatula doesn't hold it well, it always falls. the door on the fridge gets stuck, but for the price it is just fine. kids will like a kitchen no matter if it's fancy or not."
3,Storage Challenged,"I bought this kitchen for my 2 yr. old granddaughter at the request of my daughter.My granddaughter does enjoy playing with her kitchen, but I don't care for it becausethe storage areas are very tiny and hold very few of her play foods."
1,Nothing to do with PFM Premiata Forneria Marconi,"HiI just want to make it clear for everyone that, even though they share the same name, this band called ""PFM"" has nothing to do with the well-known Italian prog/rock band PFM (a.k.a. Premiata Forneria Marconi), and this album ""Producer 02"" obviously isn't a new release from the Italian group PFM.Georges"
2,Jewish evangelism?,This is a book that promises a great deal but delivers less. Perhaps it could be revised. We find out a lot about Barry Rubin and something of Jewish history. One could wish that he had more to say about actual witnessing techniques. The best section was the one on anti-Semitism. It's well written and nicely illustrated.
3,Lacks 2 good features,"This is the 2nd Combo DVD/VHS recorder I own, and it lacks 2 good features of my 1st unit: (1) when copying from VHS to DVD (or visa versa) you cannot skip over commercials so they are also copied. (2) you cannot determine the length of copied movie."
3,Good Recorder,"I bought the recorder because it had the digital tuner. A lot of these recorders do not come with tuners.ProsEasy to useCan use most types of DVD mediaDoes not look or feel cheapTunes over the air HD channelsDoes the jobConsSlow to channel surf (You can press the channel up several times before it moves up.)It can get confused when switching from DVD to VHS to fast (It once locked up so the only thing I could do was unplug it)The status information sometimes randomly displays while watching DVD's(No big deal but you already know that you have a DVD in the drive and that it is playing, why tell me when I did not ask)"
1,Junk out of the Box,"Very disappointing. We've usually liked Panasonic products, but this one was defective junk right out of the box.Something is not right with the software. We couldn't get it to set up/program properly. It kept hanging up and just getting stuck on one screen or another. And we could never get it to open the DVD tray at all -- ever.Spent maybe 4 hours trying to get this to work. The manual was just the worst we've ever seen; completely indecipherable and useless. That made it even harder to figure out that the unit wasn't working properly because you wondered if you'd missed some key step.Low quality product. Stay away."
4,Panasonic DVD/VCR,"Does pretty much what I wanted. One problem........no controls on the machine. So, if you lose your controller, you're SOL."
3,Disappointment,"1. It took a while to narrow down, but the speaker hiss I hear is coming from this unit. This ocurrs from either input, tape and DVD.2. It will let you think you are recording to DVD from DirecTV, but won't tell you the program was Copy Protected until you return to Finalize.3. User Guide is not comprehensive.4. Remote has no Mute.5. Print in black areas of remote is difficult to see, and why don't they use the age old term ""Tracking""?6. My wristwatch keeps perfect time with respect to the hourglass in this unit (typical problem).7. My replaced unit had a nifty DVD feature called ""Zoom"".Panasonic DMR-EZ37VK DVD-Recorder/VCR Combo with ATSC Tuner Black"
4,Pretty good for a hard to find item,"I wanted to wait a while before reviewing this item. We bought this back in May of 2008 as our old VCR finally bit the dust and we wanted something to play our old VHS tapes and DVDs with the option of recording. It has done okay so far. I haven't personally recorded anything but my husband has. I found the instruction booklet confusing pertaining to recording with the DVDs (but I'm not very patient), my husband was able to figure it out. The past week we had trouble recording as the remote wouldn't work and my husband finally got it to work after resetting it about a dozen times. The recorder for the DVD will only work with the remote. For the price we paid for it, it was a pretty good deal"
1,Freezes up often,"I have had this machine since Sept 07. It recorded a VHS to DVD easily enough, but in the last 6 months, I can not depend on it to even turn on! Some times, I have to unplug it for 10 seconds to re-set it, or some times I have to click play on the VCR or DVD to get it to even turn on. It will no longer turn on at the unit or with the remote. It just isn't dependable. Am looking for a different brand now."
1,Freeze Meister,"At first the unit worked fine. Then it would occasionally freeze up (i.e. none of the controls would work, not even the power button), the only solution being to unplug the power cord and then replug. After a while, it was constantly freezing AND the scheduled recording was no longer reliable. At that point I gave up. Reading other people's reviews of Panasonic DVD recorders, it is clear that mine is not an isolated case. If you are interested in a DVD recorder, I would recommend checking out the Toshiba models. Buying a Panasonic is clearly risky."
4,"Easy, mellow but substantive jazz for your soul","I love this DVD! Turn the lights down low, grab a great glass of red and your best gal and settle in."
5,"Great item, great price!","This item is exactly as shown in the picture. I use it to hold file folders full of stickers for scrapbooking. It's a great way to organize your stickers and the cart rolls right under my desk and that is a real space saver. Also, if you are an avid scrapbooker like me, it's great b/c the tote itself can be lifted from the frame for easy portability."
5,¡Perfect!,"I'm mexican, and I hope write in english a little review of this great recording. This is my second favorite opereta of Johann Strauss,-the first is ""Die Fladermaus""- because there are a many freshing, inteligent, e intense melodic moments. Also, there are an excelent structure's unity, and no only a lot numbers of ""arias"" and ""dialogs"". The style ""narrative"" is used with inteligence and the orchestration is more eloquence.About the performance, I can say that the singers are excellents, specially, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Nicolai Gedda. Just listen the first love dueto of the second act. The orchestra, perfect: emocionally and technically. This is the last volume of the collection ""Ackermann/Schwarzkopf"", and this is my favorite: almost is complete -because in others, like the Volume I, there are many cuts-, and the performance is sublime. Just buy'it."
5,Great results,This is a terrific product. Mt blood pressure went down so much that I had to cut my prescription medication from 20mg/day to 5mg/day. May soon have to go off it altogether.
4,A nostalgic delight,"OK,so she didn't have a great voice.But Annette Funicello worked hard at her music,and for anyone like me who grew up in that era,this two-CDcollection is a nostalgic treat.It may not be art,but listening to this issure good fun.The tunes are still enjoyable,and Annette sings them quite well.And the accompanying book is a nostalga buff's delight.All in all,this is a wonderful trip down memory lane."
4,Who's the little lady who's as dainty as a dream?,"Annette Funicello was the most popular of the original Mouseketeers on theMickey Mouse Club. When she sang a song called ""How Will I Know My Love?"" on the show, many people called and asked how they could get the song, so it was released on a record. That record sold decently, so she made many more records, several of which were hits. She wasn't a great singer, but she could carry a tune, and her records were very well produced. Most of her songs were written by the great songwriting team ofthe Sherman Brothers, who later wrote the songs forMary Poppins. Most of these songs are fun, although some of them are kind of silly (which just adds to their charm). This is a good collection of songs by ""America's Girl Next Door""."
4,"Great Music, muddy vocals","The instruments are played very well, but the vocals drag this CD down, IMHO. Well worth the minimal investment to hear the guitar playing!"
3,Things We Do,"From the other reviews that I read prior to purchasing this disc,I fully expected a SRV clone of some sort or other. What I heard was almost a dead ringer for Big Head Tod&the Monsters. Similar vocal character. Similar intonation and style. The song constructs are also remarkably similar. Without question the lead player is accomplished, but I didn't hear anything really fresh. A good first effort, but these kids have a long way to go before greatness sets in."
2,eh...,"Disclaimer: I have yet to hear this band live. With that said, on the basis of the album alone, it isn't very good. Their style is the same as any Stevie Ray Vaughan knock off band. The soloing is not very challenging, the lyrics are generic, and the energy is not there. As I am told, this is a band to see live. Blues in general is best served live. Perhaps this is the case with this band. You would probably be better off getting their live album or seeing them in concert."
4,"Good, but thought I was listening to BIG HEAD TODD","I really like this cd, all the songs are good, but I really thought I was listening to a new BIG HEAD AND THE MONSTERS CD, same sound ,same vocals.I hope there next cd will not be such a copy of Big Head Todd. They have great potencial, young, good musicians and good songwriters. They just need to find alittle more of there own sound."
5,Fantastic sound! Makes me want to hear them more and more.,"Indeed they sound at times like some of Vaughn's work, but they really reminded me of a great East coast bar band in the '80's, Duke Williams and the Extremes. The likeness is uncanny. Duke and the boys, primarily guitarist virtuoso Paul Plumeri, cooked up some great bluesy rock and improvisational songs. Unfortunately Duke never released any recordings. Indigenous fills the void long ago left when Duke & Co. broke up. Ahh the memories."
5,WOW,I just saw this band set the stage ablaze in Santa Barbara opening for BB King = they put on by far the best set of the night - more inspired and powerful than Kenny Wayne Sheppard or Taj Mahal and even (heresy!) BB himself. I went right out and got this record and it is Excellent - five solid stars.
4,SRV lives again?,"Uh . . . maybe not - but I think he would be honored by the number of guitarists he has influenced (the same way Albert King & Jimi influenced him), and Mato Nanji of Indigenous is definitely the real deal. This is by far the best effort that has ever been made by any of Stevie's ""proteges"" that I've heard. I really hate to label musicians by who they sound like, but in this case Stevie Ray's influence is just too strong to ignore. Not that that's a bad thing - I'm glad that the course he set is being followed by so many. Make no mistake, these guys have their own style, but when Mato cuts loose with a guitar solo you could almost swear that SRV was alive and well playing under an assumed name. By the way, I'm a HUGE SRV fan, so that may explain why I heard so much of him on this album - and why I've talked more about him than I have Indigenous. Just buy the album, you won't be disappointed."
3,"They have the tools, but...","Being a huge SRV and classic guitar blues fan, I was incredibly excited to get ahold of this CD I had hear so much about. I heard the 1st few songs with little excitement other than the too-short guitar solos. Then, Blues This Morning got me going. Great song! Unfortunately, the only one on the CD. This band could be great with a new singer and a real songwriter. I hate to say it, but right now they have ""Hootie"" written all over them. But, I can certainly see greatness in the future for them."
3,Solid traditional Texas Blues,"While the songwriting is of the level one can hear almost any given nite in any random bar in Austin, Mato Nanji has definatly done his homework and shows as much promise as any young six string gun slinger today. He wears his Billy Gibbons, Johnny Winter and most obviously SRV influences loud and proud, but he needs to find his own voice, a difficult prospect in this well mined medium for electric guitar. Worth keeping an eye on."
4,Great Album!!,"It's my first contact with the Indigenous work,and for me,a great surprise,positive,with this Nato's solos,remembering SRV's way to play.I really recomend this cd!!!"
5,--------THIS BAND R O C K S--------,Indigenous....................................... these guys are GOOD Im SERIOUS i can't say enough about them a long time waiting for a good ndn blues band they SET the grass on fire and burning up the roads where ever they TOUR GET ALL THEIR CD'S MAN YOUR MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING B I G.....
5,"Outstanding, it's the definition of Blues Rock.","You won't want to put this CD back in it's case. The evolution of blues rock is found in every song, all the greats are right there in perfect combination. Everyone that's heard my CD has bought it, I highly recommend you do the same."
5,Awesome,I heard about the band on the Stevie Ray Vaughan Texas Flood mailing list and got curious and went out and got the CD. I'm glad I did because it is great. Mato Nanji is the next blues guitar hero. I had the priviledge of seeing them live in Austin and he is even more impressive live.
5,Just close your eyes and listen.,I listened with my eyes closed and heard honest and real music. Passion and emotion. A love and respect for blues. As a people we are proud of Indigenous. Mato's voice can make a drill sergeant cry. Soulful. Their music is as good as Stevie and Double Trouble. Thank you for a great listening experience.
4,Great band,"I think this is what Kenny Wayne was supposed to sound like but falls flat on his now-Lenny-Kravitz-wannabe a** trying to accomplish. When i first heard Mato, he made me want to run to my guitar and start trying to play like him and that's the true sign of a guitar great in my book."
5,Hair Raising Ninja/Skinwalker Guitar PLUS Killer Riddims,"These young folks are hot Hot HOT ! I saw them live in Eugene Oregon at the WOW Hall. They SMOKED. The previous reviews said it all except for the Fact the the drummer is, I believe, the InheritorESS of the Ginger Baker Crown. Nato's guitar has the voice but she has the teeth. Buy this CD now and support Indigenous R n R."
2,Not for the beginner,"Well, if you want to learn how to perform hypnosis, this book isn't for you, as the information suggests. The book talks about how to set up your business, and how to treat your clients, and how to fill your practice, among some other useful info, but that info is useful after you learn how to do it I suppose. The reason for the 2 stars is the fact that the info given about the book is misleading."
3,Easy to read and certainly valuable..,"A good book for a regular practicioner in hypnosis.Do not apply to a lay man willing to learn basic techniques for induction and reinforcement of hypnosis.From France,a book that helps me to understand better my own practice..."
2,"Some Good Advice, But Forgettable...","This book contained some good advice for the beginning hypnotherapist, but, in contrast to other reviews, I would hardly call it indispensable. On the whole, the author and I simply approach our practices too differently for me to say I like his stuff... which reads as numbered must-do list... which, in turn, becomes incredibly tiresome. By the way, the ""good advice"" I referred to earlier, just so we're clear, is small and practical and usually not necessarily altogether hypnotherapy-related; for instance, for those who haven't been there before, keeping a small blanket in your office is good advice, not only for those occasions when a client may feel cold, but also for those occasions when a client wears too short of a skirt..."
5,Beyond doubt the best source for Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy,Whether you are a Professional Hypnotist or looking to expand your knowledge of Hypnosis this is a must read book. Written by two Masters of Hypnosis this book is organized to perfection. The contents will expand your knowledge and increase your ability to use Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy. I have used this book as a reference many times over in my practice and find it very helpful when dealing with clients that have difficult or challenging issues. The advanced techniques offered in this book are explained in a way that can be easily understood by anyone. I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Simplistic but powerful for beginning or advanced.,"When opening to read the book for the first time, don't let the simplistic style fool you. There are gems in here for beginning to advanced hypnotherapists. If you've been practicing hypnotherapy for some time you may have a tendency to skim through. That's what I did. However, since buying the book I constantly find myself referring to it before and after sessions. Mr. Banyan and Mr. Kein's selected style make it an easy read but leave the reader feeling powerfully confident knowing that any solution, simple or difficult, will be at thier finger tips!"
1,Not for amateurs,"Do not buy this book if you have any interest in learning about hypnosis or hypnotherapy. It basically only outlines how to run an office and deal with clients. It's great if you need to brush up on your common sense, but doesn't really work out for people who actually what to learn something."
2,Interesting material but a slow read,"It took me a long time to plow through the material in this book. The author's writing style is laborious and tedius. Like many of the newer hypnosis books on the market, it is a rewrite of the existing best seller's like Elman's Hypnotherapy whom have come before. It is not written for a beginner. I would recommend saving money and picking up Dave Elman's Hypnotherapy, Hypnotherapy written by Kevin Hogan or Hypnotherapy by Roy Hunter. John Watkin's books regarding Hypnotherapy and War Trauma illustrated with casework will provide the hypnosis practitioner as well as the layman with a well grounded foundation in the subject."
5,User Friendly,"Concise,practical and user friendly. Cutting edge, ""state of the art"" approach that challenges the established Hynotherapist community to emulate. This book is a must for the serious practitioner."
4,Very Good!!,"A really good effort, and a fantastic Australian Album that breaks away from sterotype aussie music.Highlights: ""All Coming Back"", ""Always Worth It"", ""At Your Best"", ""Don't U Eva"", ""Perfect Now"" and ""Sweet November"".Sadly though, the use of Casio-type keyboards, and thus, naturally cheesy and emotionless piano and synth ruins a few songs, such at ""Cinders"", and weakens some already very good songs, such as ""At Your Best"".Other than that, this is a top album, and has some extremely beautiful and thought-provoking tracks. Her voice is fantastic, too, but seeing her live will blow your mind, her presence is just glowing. She obviously loves what she does!! :)Go buy the album now!! :D"
1,Booooring (yawn),"So you see, taste differs.So much stars, I thought: This must be good, let's listen.But no, this is not my type of music. That boring lazy voice, those poor compositions. Nothing happens!I wouldn't even consider it to play as background music.Even though the lyrics might be good, I'm reviewing music, not poetry.I'm disappointed with this album."
4,More etheral female singers from the land of OZ ....,"Alright let's put a side the face that sarah is enchantingly beautiful..... Sarah could slot into the same niche as beth orton and sarah mclachlan but i think she has a bit more edge to her and i think the production is a bit more lo-fi and less produced, which adds to the fragility of her voice.And she definitley has australian tinges to her voice, which sets her apart aswell.Can't wait to see her live over this summer.For more gorgeuous australian femal voices check...redsunband[...]"
5,highly recommended,"On first listen this CD comes across as simple and dark, but after a few minutes of wading through it you realize that there is a lot of great, well thought out, heartfelt music on here. I came across this disk by accident at a record store when I was trying to figure out why none of the CD's I was scanning were playing. I grabbed it off the shelf just to test the system for ANYTHING that would play and found myself happier with this than any of the other albums that I was trying to listen to. Not only are the lyrics and music good, but the faint techno track that comes into the background on many of the songs is simply perfect. I'm sure that I will be listening to this for many months and years to come while I'm working away at my computer."
1,Very poor service,"I bought this item three weeks ago after reading the glowing reviews. The GPS started off well with a good signal and very good reception (7/12). Then I tried to use it on routes I know well with disastrous results the first time when it tried to get me to use one-way streets. Fortunately, it does recalculate the routes. Unfortunately, it does so very slowly. You have to wait by the roadside for it to redo the routes. Customer service is very poor. They charge a shipping fee of $25 for any warranty item they might agree to send you. Of course, you have to pay for shipping on your end as well. I returned the item to Amazon."
1,Only as Good as the Company,"I have been using the Q3 for over a year now, and will stop just as soon as I can replace it. The unit works most of the time, but tends to scramble the maps or just lock up during a longer trip. The MP3 player skips. The maps were outdated when I got the unit and so far the company has no updates to maps or poor software. Attempts to contact tech support have been thwarted by Nextar. They have made it clear to me that once they have your money, you're on your own. I will never buy a Nextar product again."
4,Don't have to worry anymore,"Thanks to Nextar GPS Navigation System, I don't have to worry about making a wrong turn, due to not seeing the street name clearly. At only 54, I am experiencing not being able to read the street name. The Nextar System tells me when to turn, which way to turn and makes my driving easier.My only issue is with being able to listen to the music, the driver was not available on the website, and customer service did respond once, telling me that they will get back to me."
1,terrible customer service,Bought the nextar Q3 gps for our vacation this summer. Took it out of the box charged the battery. Put it in the car hook up dc cord only to find out 3 hours later when the battery went dead the dc cord wasn't working. Called customer service they promised to send new cord in 7 to 10 days. Three times they promised to send a cord and on the fourth try they wanted me to buy one. I will never buy another nextar product nor should anyone else. The customer service is terrible they have no problem lying to their customers. I hope it not too late return it too the store
2,WILL NEVER DEAL WITH NEXTAR AGAIN,"THE Q3 IS SCRAP...I HAVE IT FOR ONE MONTH NOW AND IT IS HAVING LOTS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS...LOCKS UP,WON'T DISPLAY HOUSE RANGE NUMBERS,MAPS OUT OF DATE,ETC.AND TECH SUPPORT TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO AN ELECTRONIC REPAIR SHOP WHICH CANNOT FIX IT BECAUSE NOBODY HAS THE SOFTWARE BUT NEXTAR AND WHEN IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY NEXTAR WON'T FIX IT SO IT IS JUST A DISPOSABLE ITEM....IS BASICALY IS WHAT THEY TOLD ME....IF THEY MAKE IT THEY SHOULD FIX IT BUT THEY WON'T...I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH NEXTAR AGAIN"
2,"Yes, it's cheap; No, it's not very good","This is an old model (as of Spring 2009) and is available quite inexpensively from a number of places. The GPS is pretty basic, with little chance of getting new maps from the iffy support from Nextar. I also found that recalculation of routes was ridiculously, and uselessly, slow. Not a good bet for a car GPS."
1,Never buy nextar product again,We have the nextar gps system q3. We only used it twice and after that it does not work properly. The screen is white and will not set up. We have had it a year but only used it twice until now. It was a problem from the start. We called the company at least 5 times. They are not helpful at all. This was a complete waste of money.
2,few options,"This GPS has few options and is lacking in performance compared to some others I have used and seen, but its all in what you get accustomed to using. It works but the updates seem to be non-existant."
4,Great GPS,"Work's great, easy to use and program.I haven't been able to reach the update program yet, but am very satified with the operation of this unit."
1,DON'T BUY IT IT DOSE NOT WORK.,RECEIVED IT AND ON THE SAME DAY EMAILED COMPANY THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM TO GET RA # SO THAT I COULD RETUN IT THIS GPS IS A PIECE OF JUNK.
5,love it,"I have been using this on my face for years. a pea sized drop spread on both hands onto my silicone based face and well blended then buffed lightly with a towel ensures it won't smear on clothes and finishes it to make it look natural on my 65 year old well kept skin (face, neck and declotage .)I've tried it on legs and arms but it only works if you are wearing black and I'd recomend it only for evenings for us older young ladies. I just with I could find some in the big bottle again."
5,"Work on your business, not in it","The most valuable tool I was able to take away from this book is this: Work on your business, not in it. I must develop tools to delegate and accountability and guidlines for those who I have trained to follow and use everyday for optimum success in any business. I recommend this book for any business person whether you are seasoned or just starting a business."
2,Not the updated version of the book,"Although this book is fantastic, this is not the most up to date version! Check and make sure you want this older version before buying this one."
4,My Review,"A good book that starts very fast, maintains its momentum but slows down at the end. The staff organization discussion was not up to the quality of the preceding knowledge transfer. It is worth the read so I recommend it to small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs."
4,Downtown Tehran Popular Blues with a touch of persian gulf,"This smiling and good looking guy, who recently passed away, used to combine the popular bluesy music of downtown Tehran bazar's with Bandari music of his region close to the Persian Gulf. Interesting.CD inlcludes songs from the Fanoos e Aabi movie including the songs: Khastegar and navalaa.Unlike the record companies un informed claims, this CD was not made from masters and has not been remastered. The president of Caltex records, who has issued this CD, doesnt even know what Remastered means!"
3,Good book but old,"Good book easy to learn from and seems to be laid out in a reasonable manner. I can find the information I want, if it is in the book as this is a OLD book, and then I easily convert the example to re-life use. I am enjoying learning VbScript from this book and will soon be moving on to a newer book. Draw backs of the book are obvious to see, it is five years old therefore it is vary dated, it has little information on ASP, the section on Internet Explored Object model for Scripting is dated, Newly released VBScript functions are VERY DATED. It teaches about Internet Explorer version 3 as being the NEW VERSION.Still with all these draw backs I think it is a good book to learn VBScript from, it only cost me [the money] as it is outdated. Once I have learned VBScript then I can move on to a Reference book."
3,It's simple all right.,"A super tool for the beginer or other golfer who hasn't figured out what's happening when they hit the ball. Good if you shoot say over 95. I was a little disapointed in the brevity of the book, ( a careful reading took me less than two hours). It is as clear as it gets and it was usefull, but if your looking to break 90 or lower, look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon!,"I should have listened to the reviews! This glass set was tossed into a box with a few pieces of brown paper and no padding whatsoever. Surprise, surprise, it was in a million pieces when I opened it. It's an adorable set that's available elsewhere online--buy it somewhere else, even if you have to pay a little bit more. I can't believe they're still packaging it like this after the same thing has happened to so many people. So frustrating."
5,Daisy serving tray,"I am very happy w/ my purchase. The advertisement did not clearly state how big the serving dish is or what it is made of. The serving dish is quite large, but nice, and made of a china material. I purchased it as a gift and the recipient is happy with it. Note: mine came in a cardboard box, not a gift box."
1,not sulphur free,Ingredients are cherries and sulphur dioxide.The only reason I ordered these cherries was because they were described as sulphur free.I'm not returning them as its too much of a hassle.I'm thinking buying sulphur free dried fruit on amazon is a no go for me.
2,Not what I expected,"The hat is too flat at the top and unless you are looking from the top of the hat/head, you can't see the LA logo. We were trying to take some pictures from the front where you can see the dog's face and the hat with LA logo but can't see the logo because it's facing up not to the front."
3,Dodger Base Ball cap for dogs,"I loved the embroidary on the cap and the color was beautiful. This product is cute, the cloth was nice and light weight so it does not disturb the dog too much for it being on top of its head, however, I didn't like how it was fastened to the dog. Seemed as thoguth it would fall off easy. The (size M/L) was too small for a golden retrievers head. A smaller dog might have better luck"
5,great product,THIS ITEM IS VERY USEFUL BECAUSE YOUR MP3 PLAYER CAN BE CHARGING WHILE LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG OR WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE VIDEO.
5,Sansa Charger,"This is a great product, it came with multiple way to charge and that is great for the cost of it."
1,killed my electronics,"POOR quality. Beware!! It burnt out everything plugged into its usb port, including a Sansa and another mp3 player with the same usb pin-out.Do not buy."
2,"great usb, horrible chargers!!!","The usb cord works great, but the wall charger stopped working after less than 10 uses!!! Definitely got what I paid for. Better off investing a bit more for a better quality charger, you'll be doing it sooner than you expect anyways."
1,unhappy,"i ordered a few items to go with my Philips mp3 player. The items that I received, do not work with my particular mp3 player. What do i do to return them and hopefully get the correct items."
5,USB car/wall charger Sansa e250,I wanted a quick and VERY inexpensive way to charge my Sansa e250. This was perfect to get both a wall charger and car charger for USB connections. Plus the USB/Sansa connector.
2,Be careful...,I must have missed the part that said the cable was black and the adapters were white. Very unattractive and cheaply made.
3,"Charges, but does not transfer music","I bought this as a replacement for my original sandisk cable.This really is JUST a charger. It only transfered music with the cord like 20% of the time. (weird) Maybe it is not usb 2.0...However, it does charge well. Plus you can use the wall/car charger for other USB devices."
4,Does the job for little money,"A great price for a nice product.I don't have the Sansa player that this product was made for, but for $4.33 total cost, I don't care if I can't use the supplied cable.Both the wall charger and the car/12V charger work with my MP3 player, which has no batteries, just the USB connector.Now I don't have to charge the player on my computer anymore."
1,DOES NOT FIT,Does not fit Sansa E280. Do not bother to buy this item it did not fit my sansa E280 mp3.
1,Not Available Yet,"This game is not available for sale yet, so how can it ship in one or two weeks ??"
4,Nice!,"Thank you!! The book came on time and the condition was described precisely. Hopefully, this will help me with my political philosophy class. Thanks again!"
3,standard intro,"A good introduction but the professor's introductions are sycophantic, eulogizing and unbearably pedantic. The religious insinuation of Marx with Axial wise men is voluptuous and intellectually vulgar; as one of the first anti-State economists Marx deserves better. This edition is used widely by universities, so this treatment comes to no surprise.Other recommendations:Actually reading the volumes of CapitalThe Trotsky compiled reader.From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation-- David Ramsay SteeleThe Myth of National Defense-- Hans-Hermann HoppeNation, State and EconomyTheory of Money and Credit--Ludwig von Misesmarxists.orgmises.org(avoid the viking portable Marx, get the real deals)"
3,Mini Photo Size,"Great size for tiny pix but thats about it. The software is definitely outdated and very limited. They have an option to purchase an upgrade, I did not."
4,Kids will love these custom stickers,"Kids love stickers and now you can print custom stickers of your photos or digital images of their artwork. Since these are photo stickers, the images are sharper than those printed on matte stickers.The main downside is that there aren't many sheets in the pack.PROS:- Kids love 'em.- Fun to create stickers from your photos or their artwork. A good use of small cropped shots.CONS:- Not many sheets for the priceCONCLUSION:- Recommended for higher quality stickers"
5,Classical Celtic New Age--and great!,"Sky FM plays several of the cuts on this album, so I knew what to expect from it, and I haven't been disappointed. It's a beautiful, very well crafted album that any lover of this genre shouldn't be without. It's one of those that when my wife heard the first time, she asked with a little annoyance, ""How do you always find such terrific albums?"""
1,mind bending,"Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to attempt to watch. I should have been warned when Amazon said that this movie could not be posted to Australia as from normal sources but being a man who heeds no warning I ordered it through a private seller paying $12-49 post plus the cost of the , well I can't realy call it a movie no words can describe this mindless crud I had to give it a star to post this warning to all unless you are stoned , shitfaced or as dumb as what I as I was to buy this sorry I am lost for words which for a DJ is a strange state if you have money to burn and want to waste it send me the cost of post and I will send my copy its not been watched beyond 15 mins.Al Watts"
1,Horrible,I won't repeat what other one star reviews stated- they're ALL true. I read an on-line review that stated the only good thing about this film is a running time of 89 minutes and that's counting long and boring opening credits and endless credits at the end. Don't actually know about the end. I shut it down after 65 minutes- and that's what the producers should have done!
1,Lota video for an audio book,Ive never written a review on amazon before. I loved the Sword and the Sorcerer. I'm a fan of Kevin Sorbo. I also usually am VERY forgiving of movies. I can let alot go and enjoy things. With all that in mind i was severely disappointed in this movie. I liked a couple of the FEW scenes actually in the movie. the rest was all explaining and bad graphics. i mean i went into this expecting to be bad or cheesy but not like this. Everything that Oda did should have been Talon. The damn necklaces the kids used to find each other were little talons. Lee should have been and played the father considering Pare only had a few more scenes anyway. I just got lost when the movie would stop and they would try to explain things then stop again.So yeah its basically like an audio book with some moving pictures.
1,oldlady,I was extremely disappointed with this video. The Sword and the Sorcerer had a plot. Do not waste your money on this video As much as I enjoy Kevin Sorbo the acting was the worst. I have to put most of the blame on the director. I have never seen such a horrible job. There was no plot no acting no story line stunt work horrible. There was nothing good about this movie. I had waited for the sequel and I have never been been so disappointed.
3,"Sorbo good,movie as a whole,not so much!","Normally,I get excited every time a new Kevin Sorbo movie comes out. Unfortunately,that is not the case with Tales of An Ancient Empire. Sorbo's performance,imo,is the movie's saving grace. His womanizing Aedan is somewhat comical at times and rather sarcastic.He & Melissa Ordway,who plays Princess Tanis,work very well together and keep the story flowing. For the most part,though, it's just a story of vampires,warriors and some sorcery. Speaking of which,the appearance of Lee Horsley,while intended to connect this film with The Sword and The Sorceror,is totally unnecessary,since his character has nothing to do with the overall plot. It is common knowledge that this movie ran into financial difficulties,which is why it took so long for it to finally come out. In any case,I think the producers could have put out a better product than this.If you are a die hard Sorbo fan,you may want to check this out,otherwise,don't bother."
5,I Won't Use Any Other Brand,"Part of my business is printing lots and lots of address labels; for myself as well as for customers. Avery has never let me down. This product, the Easy peel, is superior to every other type I have tried. Not only are they easy to remove, but they stick to the envelop or package better than the cheaper brands. You might think saving a dollar and buying the office brand is a good idea, but those things come off in the mail. My Avery labels ride all the way to their destination. They also hold ink well (I put artwork on them as part of my business).Recommended for commercial and residential use.Ellen C Maze"
5,Always high quality labels,"Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different. Easy to remove from the backing (much easier than some other brands) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs. I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print. Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages (outlook, excel etc) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which don't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time."
3,I enjoy them even though.....,"I really don't like writing out a long address on every envelope. These are great. I can design them how I want to, but I had to use trial and error to align them properly. The package suggests to print them out on a blank piece of paper first to see if they align properly. Mine were perfect until I printed them out on the labels. I suggest not sticking the labels on top of paper. Print one sheet at a time, don't stack them if doing more than one sheet. I had to print one sheet, them measure how I needed to align them with a ruler. I wasted 2 sheets, but I made sure to write down my alignment measurement on the package so I don't waste anymore. And if you are going to add a photo in front of your address, such as a monogram letter, make sure the picture is in line with your address, not higher or lower. These also worked well for labeling folders. Also, print on one label to see if it will print properly, that way you don't waste an entire sheet like I did."
3,Small size limits versatility,"The sell feature on these labels is that they are easy to peel, but they could be much more versatile were they larger and allowed for design. The template is most basic, and while the small size gives you 2,000 labels per package, I'd rather have 1,000 larger, designable labels. As they are, I can only fit three lines of text if I use size 8 font! Improvements can allow for a template that accepts icons/avatars so that one could design according to company logo, season (falling leaves, snowflakes), event (birthday balloons) or holiday (jack o lanterns, bunnies, cornucopia). I'd rather use the pre-printed friendly, cheerful, colorful labels that I receive from charitable orgs."
1,Not good software,Download their software and could never get it to work as the label number didn't match anything on MSword... So I hunted and hunted on Word and found a size that worked..I wasted a ton of time on this and not to happy..
2,Too small,"These labels are too small for return address'. They could work with postcards, but not much else."
5,Good labels for inkjet,They print great with no jams in my printer. Easy to peal plus they stick very well to the packages I'm mailing. Avery definatly has a winner here with this product.
4,Return address lables,"Way to go Avery. All your products I've purchased and used thus far are top quality, don't get stuck in my printer and adheres to the paper."
4,Nice Small Size,These labels are great for small labeling projects and I use them for address labels as well. The easy peel is neat too.
5,Used for xmas labels,"I needed return envelope labels for my christmas cards and these were perfect. I went to Avery's site, used one of the christmas themed templates, hit print, and got my custom labels as a result. These turned out great, was easy to use with the template from the site. Highly recommend."
5,"Clean, Crisp, Elegant watch","I was debating between this and the same watch with a black face. The one with the black face seems to be quite popular since it doesn't stay available for very long. Finally, my 5-year old son says he likes the white one better and since I figured that he would 'inherit' the watch someday (I would likely buy one for him when he's old enough), I bought this one. To me, the watch looks better in person since the white face gives it a clean, crisp, elegant look. I already have a similar watch with a black face and I'm glad my son picked this white one. I don't use it very often since I have an everyday watch. Hopefully, it'll still look brand new when it's time to give it to my son. I told him I was only borrowing it from him until he can wear it. Love the watch!I do think that Amazon should at least offer 2-day shipping for FREE, especially when someone is buying an item of this value."
5,Good tag at a good price.,Excellent seller. Tag is a Tag. My friend loved it. Very good for medium to large size wrists.
3,full spectrum?,"Doesn't really appear full spectrum to me, compared to other bulbs that I have used before. It does work though if you just need a light bulb that is similar to daylight color."
2,just OK,"This watch is beautiful and is easy to use, but the quality of the strap is very bad, it was broken in 8 months"
4,Sony Cybershot DSCw50,"I got this camera about a month ago as a birthday present. I picked it because I had heard lots of good things about it, the wonderful large screen which is great for showing friends, and the ease of use. Overall I really love the camera, it is easy to use, easy to put the pictures onto my computer and the pocket size makes it easy to carry around. However, I strongly encourage getting a screen protector for it (they make universial digital camera screen protectors, avaliable on amazon) because my screen already has a tiny scratch even though I havea case for it and have been very careful when using it. Besides a few issues with the delicate screen this is a great camera!!"
1,Overpriced,"If you're still selling this years old technology for $500 whoever buys it just got robbed...It is a good camera, though, and I owned one for years. These days you can buy a digital SLR camera for five hundred bucks."
3,A bit disappointing,"I've always used the previous versions of Sony digital cameras and they worked fine. I bought the DSCW50 because it has a Karl Zeiss lens and faster shutter speed.Too disapointing.... Images are blurry in any condition, and video quality is much lower than in previous models. I hope to get my money back."
4,How did we live without these?,Didn't rate it a 5 star cause there are already cheaper cameras with mor pixels.
4,Personally I Love It,"I know so why only 4 stars - I'll get there quickly. This camera is great, compact, battery lasts forever for me, it does stills & video (the whole reason I wanted it) and it's shiny (funny how many people think thats good..) The still pictures are very good (not great) but for $200, come on, they're very good - even outside at night my turned out very good. Downsides, video in low light sucks, and you have to remove the battery to charge (I find that irritating). Oh yeah, I'm running a 4gb card in mine without any problems, give me like 1500 pictures and 3hrs video or something. I've seen a lot that says only up to 2gb but so far so good."
4,The perfect pocket camera.,"This is my third digital and is just perfect as a ""carry in your pocket"" camera. It's only drawback from my point of view is that the zoom is not very powerful. The price was the best I found anywhere."
4,Great camera...,"Takes good pictures, wasn't horribly expensive. I got this for my girlfriend a year ago and so far she has loved it. The rolling wheel menu is a really cool feature. If you're going for a compact digital I highly recommend the Sony ones in general along with Canon. Both are excellent. This one hasn't let down."
3,"Great camera, but manual is criminally bad & wrong","Using the camera is pretty self-explanatory which is essential since the manual is stunningly bad. Sony couldn't be bothered to include all the essential information in one manual, instead it refers the new user to another 4-page guide included with the product (seems to be Sony's style, since the new Sony videocamera we bought also has more than one ""manual""). Neither the manual nor the guide for this camera contain clear instructions or diagrams. Moreover, the manual claims that camera accepts the Memory Stick PRO Duo (also made by Sony), but the Sony Memory Stick PRO duo is physcially too large to fit into the memory stick duo slot in the camera. To add insult to injury, both the directions for the Pro Duo and the camera warn the reader in 3 different places to be careful to insert the memory stick into the adapter correctly, but there is no clear instruction or diagram showing what the correct method might be."
5,Fantastic Camera!,"I bought this camera two weeks ago, have taken about 100 pics, and my battery is still nearly fully charged. I thought I'd have to buy another battery when I decided to buy this camera, but I'm glad I held off, because it's not necessary (unless you're going on a two-week excursion in the bush with no access to electricity...) No problems with red-eye, no blurry pictures when taken inside with low light, and outstanding battery life. I am getting more than I expected when I purchased this camera. I would recommend it (and show it off!) to anyone."
1,Just what I wanted,I researched digital cameras for about three months. This camera had everything I was looking for and it is so very easy to use. I was really surprised at how user friendly it is. The menu is awesome and easy to navigate. This is a great camera for travel because I can put it in my pocket and not be uncomfortable. No more bulky camera bag. I am very happy.
2,Zoom & fast-motion options not up to par,"I was looking for a replacement for my beat up 5-year old Kodak Easy Share digital camera that had gone through everything with me. I chose this Cybershot after extensive comparison with other equally slim digital cameras. Unfortunately, the more I use it, the more disappointed I am with its capabilities.The zoom is limited to 3x which really hurts your distance shots (i.e. my photos of a Pearl Jam concert didn't turn out, even when I was in the 15th row!). It's also not sharp in low light (probably because the flash has no range) and the shutter speed does not react fast enough for any action shot--very disappointing on a recent ski trip. The battery does not recharge on plug-in to a computer, and runs out after a weekend of taking pictures.I would highly suggest searching for a better camera for anyone considering this one!"
4,Portable and good battery life,"Great little camera with excellent battery life which offers more than 300 images on a 1 GB card. Pros include large screen and short description (on screen) for each preset mode and Cons include lack of anti-shake features which result in occasional bad photos. Overall, recommended."
5,A great camera..,"I have been using this camera from about 6 months.. No problems ever..For the price its absolutely good. Very sleek, good flash.. I just love this camera.The camera comes with battery and batter charger. You have to get the memory card. I got 1 GB SanDisk as it is comparitively less than the sony Memory card. It is just working fine.The only problem u might find is that it takes a little long to take pictures. So if you want to takes pictures very fast you cant do it. It takes about 2-4 s to take a picture when using the flash mode. This is not really a problem.The quality of the video recorded and the volume are great.I have many great experiences with this camera. I hope you get some too :)"
5,awesome,"For the price, I feel this is one of the best digital cameras you can buy. nothing wrong with it and it works great."
2,A disappointment,"I have had this camera for at least 3-4 years now. It worked ok for a while. First the red eye function would not always work even though it was turned on. Later the battery charger malfunctioned and I basically had to slip a thick piece of paper in the charger with the battery to hold it in enough so that it would charge. Unfortunately, now when I use the flash, light or white objects appear purple in the picture. This has never happened before. I am not a heavy user (only the occasional vacation and special events) and I certainly did not abuse the camera. I believe the camera would be out of warranty by now which means I would have to pay Sony to ship it to them so it can be fixed. This is disappointing as I relied on Sony's good name and their great past products to make my purchase. We paid $200 dollars for this camera which is a shame. I will not be buying another Sony camera in the future nor can I recommend it to anyone."
2,Save your money,"I got this camera based on the fact that I like Sony products so it cant be bad. But once I got it I was really disappointed. It is hard totake a clear picture and indoor pictures come out yellowish. I played with all the settings to see if I just wasnt using it right, but no dice. Save your money and get something else."
2,I'm trying to determine why most of the reviewers love this camera,"I keep thinking I'm missing something. Here's what I've found:- Automatic mode makes a lot of blurry pictures. I read that people are messing with the ISO, etc and get non-blurry pictures but I have kids and they move and the pictures are blurry a lot of the time.- There is an annoying red light that shines in my kids' faces causing them to duck to avoid the picture.- The flash flashes 3 or 4 times before the final flash. I just realized that might be the red eye reduction which does seem to work fairly well most of the time to some degree but it's tough on kids.- No date stamp. Very annoying.The bottom line is I'm throwing out a lot of photos due to blurry results. Most of the photos are indoors - the outdoor ones are obviously better. I'm comparing to my dimage x50 which died recently but which took really good photos of movement, etc."
4,Good . . . but not the best.,"The W series of digital cameras by Sony have reduced, but not totally eliminated the ""flash dust"" problem inherent in the T series cameras. Beware of blurry spots in flash photos due to the flash being too close to the lens and illuminating dust particles. Many other Sony owners have posted similar problems on various message boards and blogs. I also didn't think scenery shots came out as clear as I had hoped.Otherwise, this camera will take sharp, colorful photos in well lit situations. Indoor flash photo of couples and small groups within 8-10 feet were quite good. Easy to use, easily fits in pockets, and the battery lasts a long time. Having a 2.5"" LCD screen AND a viewfinder is handy."
3,Not quite all I expected,"I hate to break a string of 5-star reviews, but...I've had this camera for a week, having bought it based upon glowing reviews from other owners. I'm not quite there yet. There is no scene mode for sports, or any control of the shutter speed which would accomplish the same thing. To me, that's unforgivable on such an otherwise well thought out product. As a pocketable camera to carry when skiing and mountain biking, it's coming up short. Automatic or Program modes do not use a fast enough shutter speed to stop action reliably, so about half my pictures so far are not acceptable. Burst mode is slow. In bright sun, contrast seems to be overdone. While OK for landscapes and snapshots, I'm disappointed in the DSCW50 as an ultracompact action/sports camera."
2,Did I get a lemon?,"Three months ago, I would've given this product at least 4 stars. I was very happy with it. Then, two months ago, after having owned it for 10 months, the sound suddenly died. Since I used the camera to capture short movies of my daughter, I needed audio. I sent it to a repair center, and since it was still under the year warranty, it was fixed free of charge. This month, my built-in-flash stopped working. Luckily, I still have a month left on my warranty, so I will be sending it in again for repair. However, given all these problems, I anticipate having a non-working, non-warranteed camera within the next 6 months. Sigh...."
5,Awesome!,"I have owned a Minolta Dimage and now this Sony camera. I would not have wasted $300 if I had known that a $200 camera was smaller, took clearer pictures, used less batteries, and had a bigger screen. Sony's Ion battery is the hybrid civic of all batteries. I took at least 150 6mp pix on I think a 8x10 setting. I did not want to spend a lot of money and this was a step up from the low-end Sony, which does not include an Ion battery. I was considering 7mp or higher, but I am glad I chose this camera. Out of all the electronic manufacturers, I probably would rate Sony as having the highest quality."
4,Satisfied with my purchase,"I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one."
5,Terrific,"Beautiful and informative documentary highlighting the Macedonian people's struggle for independence, and for the right to call themselves what they want. Highly recommended."
4,Marginalized,"Beware - although the narrator speaks English, most of the film is comprised of conversations of the Macedonian people in their own language - & without subtitles!! An otherwise beautiful & informative story has been marginalized because of language. What a shame!"
1,did not recieve the order at all. All I got was the e mail and the charge to my card!,I did not recieve my order . It was charged to my credit card but I never got it! I want my yu gi oh tag force or my money back!
2,Bad Yugi Game,"Load time is simply unacceptable. Its a fun game, but the load time for every single action takes way way too long. Its the standard game, but the game goes at a snail's pace."
5,naughty monkey boots,"the boots are beautiful but it takes you 15 minutes to get them on,i recommend a long shoehorn with item"
4,Good Variety - Something For Everyone,"I'll admit it---I bought this CD for Michael Callen's and Cris Williamson's songs alone. But I was pleasantly surprised to find I like all of the music, in particular the selections by Bill McKinley, Ann Reed, The Flirtations, Janis Ian, and Marsha Malamet.The music is heartfelt and literally feels true. Good voices, decent orchestration, and a feeling of strength throughout. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that the tone is a little too much the same throughout, which may be what they were striving for, but I would have liked a couple more songs of wanton, raucous celebration.One note: When Michael Callen died, a little bit of light went out of the world. His voice is hauntingly brilliant, and if I had to buy all his music one song per CD, I would. :-)"
5,John Denver-A American Treasure,"When I first saw this documentary on PBS I was so moved. This man was given a gift by God to create lyrics that described some of God's greatest gifts to us all, love, nature, relationships with Him and each other. John was an average looking man who succeeded on his creative talents alone. Thank God we have his music and this DVD tribute because we lost him way too early."
4,Thanks! Great gift,My cousin is a HUGE John Denver fan and I got this for her Christmas gift. She'll surely LOVE this! Thanks!
5,A Song's Best Friend - John Denver Remembered,"DVD received promptly and in good condition. Enjoyed hearing more about John Denver who is my all-time favorite male singer. When I listen to hismusic, it takes me back in time to the 70's.Jackie"
2,TOO much music!,"I wasn't impressed by this at all. It showed clips of him singing, but played the clips too long. I'd buy a DVD of his performance if I wanted to see this. Just very boring and sugar-coated.The best parts were the interviews with people who knew him. There should have been more of this, Then it would have been an effective documentary."
4,"Nice tribute, but limited","Overall I liked this production/documentary of John Denver's life. The DVD chapters aren't chronological, but rather each attempts to address a different aspect of his career (for example, some of the chapter titles are ""A Steward of the Earth,"" ""The Embodiment of Love,"" and ""The Showman""). There are also many interviews with the people who knew JD best, and this helps to weave the chapters together.However, I did realize eventually that this DVD covers mainly JD's RCA career, which ended around 1986. That might be because the vast majority of his hits came from the 1970s, but even the concert footage included on the DVD (four songs) are from the 1970s and early 1980s. There is nothing here from 1986 to 1997 (the year he died). While that's not absolutely necessary, I suppose, it felt to me like it was lacking something.Still, despite this, I enjoyed the program. And most Denver fans will too. Artists like Denver don't come around very often.Four stars."
5,One of the best damn bands ever.,"Powerful, engaging beats and rhythms matched by equally powerful politically motivated lyrics. Reminds us that some rock bands still care about social advancement (not just singing about trite love stories)...but that you have to look to foreign bands for that (best damn Basque band ever). Frontman Fermin Muguruza is a musical genius."
3,Not bad,This basket of food is just okay. The bread and the cheese are huge! And the cans don't have a label on them. The eggs are okay although I was surprised that they are really flimsy plastic. For the money (it was on sale at Target for $11) it is fine but not really a proper size for a pretend kitchen.
4,Classic Look,I purchased this for my wife. She loves it. She has a very small wrist and cannot handle a watch with a large face. This has an easily adjustable watch band so it fits perfectly. Seiko Quality.
4,Great Stoner Rock-Blues,"I agree witth the proceeding review. This is an excellent album, and the production is surprisingly great for a live set. Doraldina's Prophecies will blow you away if you haven't heard it yet. Here in Missoula, Mt used copies of it are selling for 1.99 at Hastings. If you have a Hastings go there and buy it!"
3,"Elaine, Paul, Pat, and Mrs. Apple","Enjoyed the read, kept my interest all the way through. Reminded me of Nicholson Baker's ""The Fermata"". Twisted characters with realistic thought clouds!!! I found myself disgusted by these people and their floundering need to cheat on everyone, including themselves. Terrifyingly absorbing and erotic!!! Whew..."
4,Suburban Madness!,"What a thrilling read this was! Paul and Elaine are riding a big ""down wave"" in their marriage and kicking and screaming to get out! Their story is as shocking as it is hilarious! Definitely a dark comedic look at suburbia that touches upon many real issues in a fresh and provocative light. A.M. Homes is a unique talent. I will most definitely be reading more from her!"
2,Inert and uninvolving,"The meandering story neither progresses nor entertains. While I found the emotions and of the characters credible, their behavior seemed inexplicable in their extremity and unexpectedness. This is not a book I'd recommend."
1,"Sorry, but this book wasn't worth the time","The Emperor's New Clothes.A.M. Homes is such a hugely talented writer, it is a shame that she wasted that gift on this story. Provocation is one thing, stooping this low to sift through humanity's dreck is quite another: spouse abuse, rape-like sex, chronic infidelity, child abuse, nervous breakdown and child murder--all in one story. The characters are universally unlikeable, the plot contrived, and the ending way too long in coming. Skip it."
2,One Very Sick Story,"If you want a depressing read filled with violence, abuse, marital discord, and a general sense of forboding, then be sure to read this newest by A.M. Homes. I honestly cannot see how any person would want to finish this dark novel....I certainly didn't. Homes is a good writer but she needs to find better subject matter and lighten up."
1,Disappointing,"This book is bad. Why follow up with characters that had no redeeming features in the first place? There was no need. Moreover, it works against the simple understated style that leaves the audience filling in certain gaps for themselves. Further, the author is trying to get cute with us - it isn't enough to re-hash old stories, she feels compelled to refer to her other characters as well (like Claire from In a Country of Mothers). This story left me empty and annoyed that I'd spent the money. A major disappointment from an author who usually provides compelling, thought provoking stories delivered through good writing."
2,What????,"I still don't get how you come to the ending of this story. I think I read someone's review that likened this book to a car wreck that you cannot help but slow down to look at. The characters are incomprehensible and sad, yet I found myself laughing quite a bit, feeling like I should apologize for my own rubbernecking."
3,Weird. Offbeat.,"Weird and dysfocused (is that a word?), this book made me think. But not for long. A strange novel, a bit on the surreal side, with some characters so real and others just wispy descriptions that flitter through the pages without any foundation."
2,I'm getting deja vu,"This stuff about the infidelities and the warfare of suburban family life has been done in numerous movies and books. This is why I didn't enjoy this book, because it doesn't distinguish itself from a book like Rick Moody's Ice Storm (which has more masterful prose) or contemporary women authors like Lorrie Moore. The prose is so-so, mostly dialogue and simple descriptions. I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 because the last ten pages or so were pretty good, but not enough to redeem the whole book."
2,Disappointing,"Despite the book being well-crafted in terms of prose and dark humor, the story itself is old and tiresome. Suburban couple lost in the meaninglessness of their suburban lives. Sex, drugs, and arson. We've seen everything but the arson a million times, and this version doesn't add anything."
2,Kind of harrowing,"A friend recommended this book to me, because she thought it was very funny. I've got to say that even when there is humor all the underpinnings are dark dark dark. This book starts bleak, ends tragic. No happy endings here."
1,A shallow wade through sexual waters,"I picked up this book because of a review on the Today's Show which touted it as dealing with the current concerns over child violence in our schools. Well, the book totally does not deal with that issue. Rather, it is a more in the vein of 'Diary of a Mad Housewife'. The preponderance of the book is consumed with lurid and detailed sexual acts (which do indeed keep your attention) but are not very well wrtitten erotica. If erotica's what you want, try Anais Nin's 'Delta of Venus'. If you want to read (yet another, yawn) a 'Wah, Wah, Wah, I'm a Bored Housewife' story, then here's your book complete with philandering husband, lesbian experimentation, and general malaise, boredom, and lack of fulfillment. It's a light read devoid of depth, insight, or even a new perspective on an old and very trite story."
5,"Homes Eclipses Cheever, Yates","There's not a lot I can add to what's already been written here. Suffice to say this is the single best book on the suburban nightmare in a long, long time, if not ever. I'm a hardcore follower of Cheever, Richard Yates (""Revolutionary Road"") and most recently, Rick Moody (""The Ice Storm""). ""Music for Torching"" takes it place atop this pantheon.The book should be required reading for anyone thinking about moving their family to the suburbs.Ms. Homes, I believe you're my soulmate. Let's discuss immediately over martinis at the Temple Bar."
1,Torch This Book,"Wow, what a clunker. Unimaginative and filled with the cliches of modern life in the cul de sac, where all children all sullen, all housewives lead lives of pill-fueled quiet desperation, and all husbands play hide the pickle with soccer moms.I could forgive the hackneyed themes if the writing itself were masterful but it wheezes along with the grace and wit of an upper-level land grant university literary seminar. The best thing about this book is that its memory won't linger with me for any longer than it takes for me to toss it in the dumpster."
1,Absolute Zero,"There are few books as empty,shallow and pointless as this nonsense.It is strictly meant to shock,but fails.This is the type of literature found in two-bit magazines and in college writing courses.Homes also seems stuck in the mindset of an adolescent with her laughable attempts at erotocism and/or provocation.Her characters are strictly cardboard fronts and cliches;the dialogue is sub junior high school level.Worst of all,the novel is totally beyond being in the realm of the believable.Even more,the author seems confused on what she wanted this book to be.This book reads like a satire and total farce one minute and the next it grasps for earnestness and fails miserably on every front.This is a true waste of time and paper.Avoid at all costs."
1,This Book Stinks,"AM Homes only appeals to book critics who are so bored with their jobs that they get all titillated when someone tosses every imaginable horrible human event into one book. Who are they kidding? This book is dreck. Homes writes about repulsive people who bear no resemblance to anyone I've ever met. With so many things to think about in these complicated times, you would think that Homes would try to say something important, resonant, thoughtful--OK, just funny. But I guess it's a lot easier to just take the shock route and leave any real thinking to others."
4,The Cat Barked?,"At some point in our lives, we all wish to be someone else. The Cat Barked? is a wonderful book of a loving cat that desperately wants to be a dog. Throughout the book, readers learn how much fun it is to be a dog. When the cat&#65533;s owner informs her that dogs have to do endless tricks, stay on leashes, and many more unpleasant things, she begins to think twice. In the end, she decides that being a cat might not be too bad."
3,Abstract,"If you are seriously interested in the cutting edge art scene of New York City between the late 1930s to the early 1970s this is a book to buy and read.However, I do think many general readers will find the prose of Jed Perl over the top, with his constant use of phrases that sound heavy but are light on meaning, e.g., ""contextualized romanticism"" and ""improvisational conceptualist."" I also recognize that ""dialectics"" was a major catchword of this art era (and of Marx) but its frequent use in this book is taken to an annoying extreme.Mr. Perl certainly possesses an arsenal of knowledge and strong opinions which he machine guns out in this book on art at mid-century in the Big Apple. Its many forms of art, key artists, and related places--like the Cedar Tavern, Hofmann's school, and Black Mountain College--are all covered."
2,"Not Bad, but not Great","This book was an OK read, not a bad book, but nothing spectacular either. The writing seemed to drone on without any real punch and it never did foster any real excitement for the evolving story of New York as the center of the art world. The book misses a great opportunity to do something significant with an interesting subject. It mostly felt like a narrative of events punctuated by passages of overwrought artspeak. The word ""dialectic"" was used much too many times.When I finished the book I'm not sure what I read. The only new insights that I developed from the book came from the discussion about Fairfield Porter.The book suffers from being published at about the same time as the much more captivating Stevens & Swans' ""De Kooning: An American Master"" which covers much of the same ground but is a more interesting read."
1,"crap,crap,crap and more crap",Crapy graphics crapy strategy crapy game this game is the worst game I ever bought and I serously recommend it to people who want to spend their money like idiots don't buy this game it is crapy
2,"Great story, terrible DVD (and VHS) transfer","I second the reviewer below on the DVD. Apparently they did not solve the problem that appeared when this was released on VHS, which was the nighttime scenes are so dark, it is hard to watch. I gave this DVD to my dad for Christmas, and he said the problems with it being too dark (almost unwatchably so) are no better than the ealier VHS version release. His home-recorded VHS, off a rooftop antenna in 1984, is of better quality than the DVD."
5,A man with as many principles as Flag....,"Flag Purdy(Alan Arkin) is a man of many principles, and it's driving his family from him. A Matter of Principle is a humourous, heart-warming anecdote of a man who has to learn the hard way. It is a Christmas story, so the happy ending is inevitable, but the creative names of the Purdy children, and the quirky, irksome character portrayed by Alan Arkin more than make up it. This is a short, entertaining film that has been enjoyed by my family for many Christmas eves."
2,A Matter of Principle,"5 Stars if this was a good copy of the movie. This is a great story, but I am extremely dissapointed in the DVD version. As two of the other reviewers said, the night time scenes are so dark, it makes it difficult to enjoy. I have a VHS copy I made from TV which is a little grainy, but it is far better than the DVD version. If I had read the reviews before, I never would have purchased the DVD."
2,A Matter of Principle,We had an old VHS copy of this wonderful program taped off TV. We wanted to upgrade the quality to a DVD so we ordered this one. The DVD we received is very poor quality. It is so dark at times it is hard to make out the characters. Returning it would not give us a full refund so we are stuck with it. Very disappointing.
3,"Great Film, VHS quality","Alan Arkin is believable in this well written, well acted film about principles. Just wish the quality of the DVD was better than a VHS. c'mon guys. It's not like it was shot that way. The original footage had to be at least 35mm film."
2,A Matter of Principle,Have it on VHS bought years ago. Wanted it on DVD.It is much brighter on VHS than the DVD.
5,Poem as Phoenix,"How often does Keats get dragged out to do the bidding of some review--and yet it is difficult to imagine many books that would get closer to his advice to ""load every rift with ore"" than Simone Muench's Lampblack and Ash.It isn't enough to say that Muench hears the music of the line, without acknowledging how she sees the visual music inside each word and the strumming of letter to letter. Her poems are at once, spare and ornate, rich and stark. These poems are muscular, gorgeous and perfectly composed."
4,Sold cable NOT A BELKIN,The cable works and it works nice but it is not a BELKIN. for the $5 or so I paid I really don't care but it should be known
3,"Great Cable, Shipping Overcharged","Awesome, fast delivery. Arrived one day prior to the earliest day of the delivery estimate. Packaging was in good condition, did not show any signs of damage at all. It was as if I had purchased it from a retail store. The only thing unfortunate, however, is the shipping price. At more than 7 dollars, the shipping was more than the item itself! And I live only about 15-20 minutes drive away from the delivery location!I primarily use it for my Xbox 360 to play live with. It was a great deal, considering the fact that a wireless adapter would be $100."
4,Actually not Belkin Cable,"I received the cable in a timely manner and it works as it should although it is very stiff. It is advertised as Belkin cable but that is not the brand name on the cable,the brand is CMPLE. In addition it was 24' long not 25' as specified....it worked but with no room to spare. I am satisfied for the price but feel it is misrepresented. When compared to actual Belkin cable (name on it) it is thinner and considerably stiffer, the Belkin is much more supple."
4,Reliable Belkin,Use this to connect from my wall to my router. The long cord is very convenient and I have not found any degradation in speed. Would recommend.
5,Not Much To Say...,"If you are setting up a network, this is the quality cat V cable for you! My system works great!Happy Holidays,Smacka"
3,Ok but not great,"This is our first mighty machines video and we were a little disappointed. It moves slowly and the sound of the machines is muted quite a bit so my son loses interest easily, even though he is a complete nut for any kind of truck, tractor, or airplane. We'll probably try another mighty machines, hopefully it will be better, but we may need to look for another maker if they are all similar."
3,Best of Mighty Machines,"When I bought this DVD I bought it thinking it was about Helicopters since that is what the pictures was on the front, but when it came, it didn't have that picture. Very misleading. It had the parts that were described in it, but just had a different cover picture. The grandkids love it and learn alot about different machines. They need to check their stock with what they advertise."
4,Not quite longboard worthy.,"I cut this to use as reflective trim on my longboard. Let me just say it's holding up okay. Parts are still on but the part on my kicks immediately broke of brittlely the first time the kick touched the pavement. The rest is still there but it's slowly peeling away. Didn't come with enough either, but that's my fault for not taking note of that part. If you're using this for something that wont be getting abrasive damage then go for it, otherwise, look for something more durable (and expensive). But if you need a cheap solution asap, it wouldn't be your worst choice."
1,Not reflective at ALL!,The tape is red and it is rolled up.This is not a very reflective tape.Its Red.Poor Quality for a 3M product!Get something else.
3,In The Silence,"Decent CD, Well produced and sounds excellent.Leslie Ritter has a great voice and the music is top notchThe problem with the CD is nothing really stands outI like the CD but to me it sounds like a lot of other CDs in this genre that are out there"
2,"Cheaply made, easily broken","Oh how I wish I could find on of those old, heavy, solid metal memo holders. I need something that has a firm, tight line guide on it that will clearly mark one horizontal line. This isn't it. The line guide is loose and sloppy and will not stay horizontal. It falls off easily, and in fact in a few weeks it was broken. I've resorted to using a rubber band as my line guide which I guess is better than nothing. But I certainly don't think this was worth the price."
3,"Questionable video quality, great songs!",I really like the music on this video. Too bad the quality of the video is fair at best. The video showcases some of Nanci's best songs with wonderful singing and playing. I wish the video company would have done a better job with quality. It is a 5-star video with 3-star video quality. Two stars docked for a hard to watch but wonderful to listen to video!
3,What's the Answer?,"I have used this bag with my infant Graco SafeSeat Step 1, and my (huge) Graco SafeSeat Step 2.I don't know what the right answer is for traveling with a car seat. This is an okay solution. I was hoping it'd be a heavy canvas, but it's more of a cheap duffle bag material. The first time we used it, it got holes in it and the strap popped off while I was carrying it. It's a battle to get the seat in and out of the bag. But the carseat got to my destinations and back without damage, so I supposed it accomplished its purposeI don't know what the right solution is, but I hope someone comes up with a product better than this one."
4,Works great,This works great. We use it to store our son's car seat when not in use. I got it because it will keep his seat clean.
4,Good for gate-checking,"We used this to gate-check a carseat when traveling with our twins (works for both infant carriers and convertible carseats). My only beef is that the material is somewhat stiff. I'd like it if it folded/collapsed more easily when not in use, but perhaps that will come as it gets used more. Otherwise, it's great to have a sturdy bag to put the carseat in, for regular checked baggage or gate-checking. You never know what kind of abuse it will get put through, and who wants to have their child's carseat ripped, stained, or otherwise trashed? This keeps it safe and clean."
2,"Nice looking bag, but unreliable","We purchased this bag from Amazon in May 2008. The bag is a nice looking one and was able to fit our Britax Boulevard, which is a big car seat, nicely. We took it with us on a 2 hour domestic flight, and upon retrieving it from baggage claim, we noticed a hole in the bag from where the car seat was pressing on it. So, this is a good travel bag for a few trips, and after that, you'll likely need to trash it."
4,Great!,The product comes in a small package but goes a long way. I'm happy with what was advertised and what I received.
5,Happy customer!,"Book was sent fast, no problems with delivery. The book was in excellent condition. Would definately recommend this seller. I saved about $60 by buying on Amazon."
4,Interesting historical overview,"This is a great book for the Russel Wright collector who wants to know more of the backstory and history of the man and the pottery. But do not confuse this book with a collector's guide. This book will probably not help you to decide if a piece is RW or not, and certainly will not help in pricing or deciding rarity."
3,These 4 Songs Earned Slo Burn a Spot on Ozzfest,"This is the only release Slo Burn ever put out. John Garcia from Kyuss is the singer, along with 3 guys I've never heard of. People say this band had great potential and was brilliant and all that but when I first heard the EP I thought ""People were just looking for anything that reminded them of Kyuss, they were in shock because Kyuss was gone. That's why they liked this."" I thought it was uninspired and really nohing special. But man did it grow on me. As it turns out, these are some really great songs, maybe not works of art but definitely they rock. And the thing that does it is Garcia's vocals a lot more than the music. Really catchy stuff without being mainstream. Maybe these guys had something going for them after all. If you liked Kyuss, check it out. If you like rock, check it out."
1,A calculated rip-off,"Another reviewer pointed out the fact that this bundles some items for the original Zire and others for the Zire 71, so unless you own both models, half the included stylii and screen protectors are useless to you. The enclosed case does have a belt loop, but it doesn't clip on (you have to thread your belt through it). And the case itself is made of amazingly flimsy translucent plastic - I figure it will last a few weeks at most. I'm now wary of buying any other Palm-branded accessories."
3,"Worth it for the case, but needs more","The case, slightly bigger and easier to deal with than the one that comes with the Palm Zire 71. The extra styli thrown in make it worthwhile. The only complaint here is that there are only two screen protectors. A few more included would make this a purchase worth making."
1,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Aka DOWN WITH HIGHLIGHTS!","Highlights is quite possibly the most completely unhelpful and unentertaining magazine i've ever read. It isn't funny, and it's often patronizing and tries too hard to include everybody. It isn't educational at all. If you want your child to grow and develop, don't get highlights. If you want your child to be an average, ordinary, everyday person who is content with reading insultingly easy little stories that are complete gas and bunk, go ahead. The inanity of this magazine would be amusing if it weren't so pathetic. Don't get this magazine! Your brain is a special thing-don't let it deteriorate completely. You have been warned."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!,"I ordered Highlights and High Five for my boys for Christmas. That was in Dec. 2009. It is now March 8, 2010 and even with all of my phone calls and Amazon's request to Magazine Exress, NOTHING! I am now trying to get reimbursed. What a total disappointment. Do not make the same mistake I did. The magazines are probably great, I would find another way to order them! I have looked at other reviews and found I am not the only one in this boat!"
1,C'mon,"Ordered this for my nephew on 12/18/2009 and it still has not arrived yet. Now the email I received advised it wouldn't arrive until February-March, but still that should be a worst case scenario. I have ordered mags from Amazon before and it was no where near this bad. Never again!!! I will go directly through the publisher next time."
3,Son's Gift,"My husband and I brought a Highlights Magazine subscription for our 7-year-old son for Christmas. He loves reading magazines, and had read this one before, so we thought he would get a lot out of it. The subscripion arrives on time and our son flips through it the night he receives it, but we have been disappointed to note he does not continue to read through them as he has done with other magazines. My personal opinion is that the magazines are full of variety and the references to current events are very educational. But for my son I think there are not enough stories and comics in the magazine to keep his interest. My husband and I plan to read through the next issue with him when it arrives, hoping to inspire his interest in the articles and activities inside."
3,Highlights for Children,"I bought a subscription for Highlights for Children in May. I loved this magazine as a child, and now want the same for my 3 year old. It's still great, but I received my first issue in June. The magazine I received was the January issue, however. Great for kids, but certainly not current events!"
2,"Magazine good, Customer service bad",I placed an order thru the mail for 2 Highlight magazines and 2 High 5 magazines in November. They were Christmas gift subscriptions and were all placed at the same time and paid for at the same time. Amazingly 1 Highlight magazine came 2 weeks later and the other Highlight magazine came 2 weeks after that. Here it is December 28th and still nothing from High 5. I called Customer service only to recieve a very rude woman who told me they were not placed at the same time and therefore not shipped at the same time. She said she could resend them but that was doing me a favor as it was all my fault. I won't order from them again considering my money bought my 2 younger neices nothing for Christmas but a bunch of tears.
1,Dull and hasn't changed with the times.,"I read this magazine as a kid and liked it well enough but it hasn't changed at all in 4 decades and now comes across as dull and dated. My 6-year old son received it as a gift. He hasn't been interested in reading it, and the few times I've tried to read it with him,it's hard to find anything you want to read in it. The graphics look like something from the 1960s, and the stories are moralistic and boring. The magazine is alsoobsessed with ""hidden pictures"" puzzles, which maybe some kids like, but I find utterly tedious (and my sondoes too). I cancelled the subscription. Try Ladybug instead for much better stories and artwork."
1,Do NOT order it here because you won't get any magazines.,"I ordered this magazine a year ago, and my nephew still haven't receive a single magazine! Every time I email customer service they would tell me that it's coming next month. I will let you how the magazine is when I get it, but don't hold your breath."
2,"SLOW, haven't received product","This product has a freakishly long shipping time for some unexplainable reason because the magazine industry exists on another planet FAR FAR away and even though they charge you shipping, sending you the magazine is NOT really their priority. I actually like this magazine a lot but I wish I'd bought it at Walmart."
5,Great magazine for kids,"I was lookout for magazines for kids which keep changing stories/cartoons/letters etc. My daughter waits for subscription to come and she waits for the postman to deliver it. It is good waiting old school type. The magazine engages kids with variety of activities like reading poems, interesting jokes, riddles, Quiz lot of stories, fun activities. Even fum for mom and dad!Example joke: Mom, Alexandria, did you take a shower this morningAlexandria: Why is there one missing?"
4,What's Great; What's Not,"What's Great:1. Educational activities still engage kids after all these years.2. Art work is great for kids' eyes.3. Worry-free content!-- no consumerism, poorly written story lines, garbage filler.4. Kids love getting regular mail.What Could Be Improved:1. Price point is still too high."
1,Worse than a history lecture!,"Don't get me wrong I like Daniel...But reading chapter after chapter of Whitelaws having him prattle on was just TOO much. Knowledge of a subject is great, but doesn't make for an intersting novel. Way to much info. The story was disjointed and I didn't believe her character portrayals of SG-1. Boring! The two Honor books were 5 stars."
1,Amateur Stuff,"Terrible going...as slow as wading through molasses. To make matters worse, Daniel Jackson's Grandfather, Nick Ballard, vanishes partway through the novel with no explanation, and is never seen or spoken of again. I wish they had more professional writers handling this series."
3,City of the gods- a little over the top.,"I've read several of the Stargate novels, but this one seems a little off. Much of the relevant part of the story was rushed while the rest of it seemed like it would never end. It definately wasn't one of my favorites, but if you're an avid stargate fan like me you've still got to read it!"
1,worst kindle book ever,"formatting is atrocious, content is basically OK, this e-book is a stinker, I found the PDF file online and does not have any of these formatting problems."
5,Cherrished Cuddles,"A review from our seven year old---If you are needing to buy a gift for someone and want to make them happy you should get this gift. He is a wonderful dog to have because he is so cuddley. I want you to know that this dog is warm, cuddley, soft, lovable, always obedient, never messy, and easy to clean. We wash our little guy in the washer--gentle cyle I think. He comes out sparkling clean. If you need put a smile on someone buy Cuddles because he has made me smile so much that I want to give him a brother. Douglas has called him Charles but he did not look like a Charles. I hope that this review helps. Enjoy your purchase! Litlbear"
2,"Good Movie, bad disc","I like the movie. Different perspective on the cold war and covers a little known subject. However, the disc wouldn't play on my Bru Ray machine. It will play on my Mac and I Apple TV it to the TV. So, its okay."
4,Say Hello to Farewell,"This is an exceptional spy-thriller. During one of the more tense periods of relations between the US and Russia, this movie weaves a story of suspense and tension. A French engineer is recruited to pass documents containing information which would constitute the most important Cold War espionage operation known to date. Tension builds as the authorities close in. Will the Frenchman and his family make it out of Russia in time?There are many twists and turns throughout the movie -- even at the end."
1,Waste of money,"This video should be sent out free of charge as it is nothing more than an advertisement. The amount of information on the Turks and Caicos is minimal and the video has advrdtisements for other vacation spots such as the Dominican Republic and Jackson Hole. It is a total waste of money. There is a one star rating on this review of this video because in order to write a review, one has to choose a rating and the lowest rating is one star."
3,"Dead or Alive, We Are Out to Get You, Dead or Alive...","Now, you mightn't think those are particularly catchy lyrics, yet that's the song I enjoyed most from ""Rose Marie"", this proud boast of the Canadian Mounties, led of course by Nelson Eddy. I would be remiss not to mention, however, that two other much better-known songs come from this movie, ""Oh Rose Marie, I Love You"" and the mega hit, ""When I'm Calling You--Indian Love Call"". One time they played a bit of that number on the Oscars, and I was sad to see the audience hoot at the rendition. I guess they had gotten beyond simple love stories from a simpler time like this one. The story line is a tad unusual: Jeanette MacDonald, a famous opera singer, races up to Canada to try to find her fugitive murdering brother--very young James Stewart--before the Mounties do (that's where their theme song comes in handy). Well, they somehow manage to carve out a happy ending from this unlikely premise, but that's what movie magic is all about!"
5,Rose Marie,I was very happy with this product. The service was exellent. The item arrived on time. The DVD is a must for anyone wanting to see Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy.
3,great classic!,"The storyline is weak. HOWEVER....the beautiful voices of Eddie and MacDonald and their Indian Lovecall (I am calling you) rendition are worth buying this movie. Janette's cute attempt at dancing in a local pub in the style of a baudy competitor is charming. This movie is musical and much of the music (besides Indian Love call) is not to be remembered.I am glad, though, that I have it in my collection."
3,merchandise damaged,The video was the one I ordered but it was obviously damaged in transit. It should have been packaged better.
3,rose marie,the picture was good and the sound was wonderful hearing their beautiful voices. it was also seeing them young. thanks for the work done. have bought many movies from amazon and NEVER been dissatisfied.
5,MacDonald and Eddy Have Simpatico,"Rudoph Friml's ""Rose Marie"", filmed in the 1930s, stands strong, even in 2001. Its stars shine as a memorial to the era. At her elegant best as an opera singer seeking to save her brother, a young Jimmy Stewart, from a life of crime, Jeanette MacDonald follows his trail to the Canadian Rockies. There, Royal Mounted Police Sgt. Bruce played by Nelson Eddy, committed to his duty as an officer of law, uses MacDonald, (Rose Marie) as a decoy to get his man. Their words of love are painfully sacrificed in the echoing hollows of the magnificent Northwest. The music haunts the story throughout. The pace of the drama is flawlessly done, directed with total honesty to Friml's artistry. No detail is overlooked in this poignant drama of idealistic love, so masterfully commanded by both MacDonald and Eddy. It's almost as if they were not acting at all."
3,rose marie,"I was a little disappointed with the sound. When they are speaking, it's low and when they sing, the sound bellows out. You have to keep adjusting the sound while listening to the movie."
3,Berlioz Te Deum,"It is impossible to rate this CD. Berlioz is the composer, not the conductor!! Which orchestra? Who is the conductor? Which choral group? Who are the singers? We need more information!!"
4,Good for creative movement with young children,"I teach preschoolers and I've been using this CD for years. It's not the most interesting music you'll ever hear, but there's some fun stuff for little ones to move to. ""Chugalong Choo-Choo"" is a favorite, and fun to play after you read a book about trains. The Bunny Hop is fun for springtime. I don't teach the real Bunny Hop dance (way too hard), we just hop around and pretend to pick up eggs to put in our pretend baskets. Other songs are good to use as instrumental background for movement activities."
5,good for lots of ages,Even though the CD says Preschool my 2 year loves it and can do many of the movements. Its a fun CD that works great for getting a kid moving and following instructions.
5,These women can paint!,"I have to admit, I always wondered why there aren't more women artists...well, there are many I never heard of, but should have. The artists presented here are truly deserving of notice and even fame in some cases. Very well-illustrated and well worth the price. Information not available in any other book that I know."
5,Excellent rescource,"This book is full of hard to find information. If you collect art or just appreciate art, this book will bring you interesting stories of wonderful women artists, known and unknown! And excellent artist resource! I wish the author would write several more volumes. I would buy them all!"
4,Not to be missed!,"We again are with the warriors of Suzaku in Houkkan, the land of Genbu. The Suzaku seven have suffered their first loss, but are determined to press on and be victorius over the Seiryuu Seven. Miaka, in turn, is strongly moved to make sure that nothing more will happen to any of her friends. Miaka resigns herself to the unavoidable battle that will occur between her and the Priestess of Seiryuu, Lady Yui. Meanwhile, Yui becomes aware of one of her warriors having feelings for her. But her heart cannot be moved toward him due to the pain of her past and the ache for Tamahome, a fact which the powerful Nakago uses to his advantage.With new countries, old and returned warriors long thought dead and new trials and evils to overcome at each turn, Miaka and Tamahome's love is put to the test yet again and with each passing moment, it would seem that they are doomed to be apart.Volume 6 of Fushigi Yugi contains 6 episodes of the series (#34-39) A set of episodes not to be missed!"
3,Caveat Emptor,"This watch is truly beautiful, and at a steal of a price. I bought it as a present ot myself for a promotion, but within 1 week of wear the bezel came off! Since Amazon is not an authentic TAG retailer the international warranty is nul en void, and amazon's replacement/refund policy won't cover anything worn. Basically everything for this is going to come out of pocket and is going to completely negate my savings on the watch.I don't regret buying the watch, as it truly is classy, practical, and eye catching without being flashy, but had I bought it from a true retailer I would have been able to have a better warranty free, as well as free lifetime battery replacements for life. Lesson learned.Caveat Emptor: Buyer beware."
4,No Guarantee card,Dear SellerI have recived in perfect conditions my Tag Heuer Watch but it doesnt have the Guarantee Card. Im from Ecuador and Im living in Quito. Please tell me how you can help me?Best Regards.
2,water damage,even when battery changed by authorized dealer these seals only hold once after the second batter replacement the watch is no longer water proof or even water resistent - it will get ruined the first time you take a shower and forget to remove it
5,Nice and reliable,I have been using mine daily over the last 11 years. Only one battery change and no one single scratch. No water problems after the battery change.I would recommend this watch to anyone.
5,Great music!,"I have this album in vinyl, the CD quality is great, plus the CD has some bonus tunes.I would recommend this album to any 70's bands lovers!"
3,Gaucho lore,This was an interesting visual film set in Argentina in which the illegitemate son of a wealthy landowner finds a mentor in an old gaucho. Very slow paced but worth the scenery of Argentina.
2,"If you loved XCOM, stay away from UFO...","Like another reviewer said - The magic of XCOM just isn't there. They've taken away most all of the base management, oversimplified soldier management, and dumbed down combat to the point that I almost want to cry. After a few hours with UFO, I loaded up XCOM again and enjoyed myself quite thoroughly.It seems a lot of companies are going this way in the followups. Please, please, please - Stop dumbing down the games we love. We're not all stupid gamers."
3,In the Aftermath of Glitches,"I have to say, not many games with the title UFO come close to capturing the awsome experience of the original Ufo:Enemy Unknown game made my Micropose, but this one is by far the closest yet. It incorporates crisp graphics and a simple non-micromanageable interface that is loads of fun - WHEN IT WORKS.This is my second day playing the game, and although I havnt had much trouble the first day, the second day was wasted playing catch-up due to fatal excexution errors. (you would think saving often helps... but no. The errors seem to be saved with your files- meaning you have to load a game from hours ago.)My recommendation is to wait until they come up with a COMPREHENSIVE patch (up till now the 1.2 patch is more like a placebo.)Just in case you were wondering, this game would get 5 stars otherwise- but glitches DO effect the playing experience."
4,Great UFO series installment,"This is, in my opinion, the best game in the UFO series. Aftershock doesn't feature the bases, and Afterlight doesn't have the, well... Earth stuff. For me, the actual weapons are a must. That's part of the enjoyment, like playing the Fallout games - real stuff in a surreal environment.The Gameplay is good, especially if you like to move the men tactically, out of real-time. Having the option to go to real-time in a way that actually works is nice (i.e. in Fallout Tactics, most of the time the rt combat will get you killed.)The graphics are what they are. The sound is never something I can really comment on, since I turn it off and listen to music. It gets a bit buggy if you have other stuff running in the background, so keep it to music, or find another game to play when your torrents are active.I give it a 9 out of 10."
4,I hope there is a sequel,"It's hard not to compare this with XCOM, a game i loved for many years.There are some missing features, such as the ability to enter buildings or the ""verticality"" of being able to go on top of stuructures.However, once i set these prejudices aside, i found this to be a solid game in its own right that is every bit as addictive as an XCOM game."
1,"crashing all the time, needs some major patching","don't buy this , buggy , you spend more time loading the game and crashing it than completing a level, soo many buggy pc games out therecheers good luck! if you buy it"
3,The sequel is upon us!!!,"On October 21st, 2005 the sequel to UFO: Aftermath is due to be released. As of right now only amazon.co.uk has it. I'm not sure what their American counter-parts are waiting for to list the game on the site as I'd really like to buy. Its made by the same developers as the original and builds off the story line of UFO: Aftermath. By everone's accounts this sequel is supposed to be much better than the original. The title for the new release is called UFO: Aftershock."
5,X-Com Rules Supreme,"Call it X-Com 4 I guess, but as usual, I was impressed. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Why they don't make more X-Com games, I'll never understand."
4,No one said this is supposed to be X-Com,"I'm amused by all the idiots rating this game lower than 4 stars because it isn't X-Com. Hey idiots, no one said it is X-Com. It's X-Com-like, but it isn't made by, endorsed, or promoted by Microprose or anyone who had anything to do with X-Com.If you want to rate X-Com, go rate it on the X-Com page. This game is called UFO Aftermath, and it's a fun game with good graphics and addictive game play. I have not had the same crash problems that others have reported. At about $20 currently, it's worth the money. You'll have fun.Oh, one last thing... It's NOT X-Com!"
1,This game is a piece of CRAP!,"This game is stupidly easy at first, then completely impossible all of a sudden later on!"
2,Fair,Did not like the graphics! There seemed to be a lot of playing options but the graphics were so poor I did not play the game!
2,pretty awful,"i totally agree with the other reviewer but the sound is so so, it has its high points for the price."
1,POS No tech support,"Looks like it should be a good deal. It Disconnects and locks up the computer after a couple of minutes use. It seems to have bad drivers and bad firmware. Bought on February 9, It is now June 13 and still have not had my support email answered. Not a good buy for sure. Very much a bad product/company. Stay clear. On a good note-the dongle works on my old modem which is why I bought this POS."
5,JUST IVY FROM CALIFORNIA,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT EVERYWHERE. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE LOCATED IT THROUGH AMAZON. I WON'T USE SWIFFER PRODUCTS AS I REMEMBER THERE WAS SOME CASES OF PETS DEVELOPING LIVER OR KIDNEY PROBLEMS FROM SWIFFER PRODUCTS. I'M SO HAPPY AMAZON HAS HARD TO FIND ITEMS.
1,Unhappy purchase,"Was glad when I thought I found the disposable readymop pads, however after receiving them I tried to use them with my readymop and they are way to small to cover the mop. Have not seen another mop that clorox makes that these would fit. Therefore they are worthless to me and I wasted $ll.00"
3,mop head,I have linoleum floors and they have to be swept very well. If you don't they just streak your floor.
5,For Hardwood Floors!,"After just putting down new ""Bellawood"" hardwood floors I was skeptical on which floor cleaner to use. I have been swiffering, but that just wasn't enough. I also read multiple reviews on floor cleaners that left ""streaks."" With the Clorax Ready Mop starter-kit, being only $13.97 at Walmart, I decided to give it a try. It's inexpensive, easy to assemble, with a streak free cleaning. I'm a fan!"
5,Buy a world atlas!,"This book was great! I didnt know how someone could have written a book that does the C-130 justice, but this book does it. Some of the places that Mr. Dabney writes of while documenting the herks feats were places I previously have never heard of. I just happened to have a world atlas and broke it out. Not only was the book a great read, but it provided a history and geography lesson while telling of the herks many stops and heavy lifts. No question about it, this is a must read for anyone who loves aviation history or the 130."
2,"Good overall picture of aviation, but factually confused.","This is a book that a novice would enjoy. It gives a very broad perspective of the history of aviation. The photography is first-rate, and the organization is addaqate.The really troublesome problem is with the time-line. There are pictures with the wrong descriptions, and wrong manufacturers. General aviation gets shorted with not very much written about the majority of todays flying in the private sector.I expected more with the Smithsonian name on the cover."
5,Getting a handle on the bugs,"Having an indoor / outdoor dog means all to regular bouts with critters best left OUTSIDE!! Worse yet is when they get on his insides. This book is very easy to read, yet covers every worm and icky thing my dog has become infested with yet. There is more detail in here than I ever want to know, but it is plain spoken and simple to follow. The herbal remedies given make sense and are explained in good detail. Ms. Newman has a very freindly, down to earth writing style that makes this easy to read through and remember."
1,Beware,"Some parasitic infections (like heartworm for example) can be deadly for your pet. While herbal remedies may have a place in certain aspects of veterinary medicine, please visist your vet if you think your pet may be suffering from a parasitic illness. Waiting too long may make it too late!"
2,"Great composer, disappointing CD","This CD attempts to capture music from some of Williams' greatest scores. However, it makes the mistake of lumping everything into just four monolithic tracks. Making it frustrating to skip to favorite movements.Although it's more expensive, I highly recommend ""John Williams Greatest Hits 1969-1999"" instead."
5,Excellent Resource for the Busy Person,"Whether you're a lazy gardener, or just plain busy, Mara Grey will give you advice and solutions on how to maintain a trouble-free beautiful garden. She covers everything from the basic ingredients for a garden, to independent plants and bulbs, to even curing ""Gardener's Guilt"".Are you much too busy to read this book? Then start off by taking the ""HELP!!! I'm Too Busy to Read This Book"" quick quiz. It will take you right to the sections applicable to what you're looking for, whether you're in the planning stages, needing help stages, or a troubleshooting stage.If you are a beginning gardener, much-too-busy-to-garden gardener, or just a plain ol' lazy gardener, this book is a must-have!"
2,need answeres,we would like to purchase this item but cause it is no photos of how the bed is build? we spent 1/2hour sourcing visiondecors web site without locating the same style bed. we looking for a platform bed for a tempur-pedic mattress. please show more photos
4,good use of archival footage,"america is such a funny country some times - in terms of humor. but airstreamers places that humor in perspective. it's the story of a trailer inventor who liked having a good time, and that trait of his got turned into a 'club' where others could participate. the makers of film did a good job not to make fun of the participants but to allow their personalities to show through. it's a good watch. I just wish it was longer."
5,Pure Light,"I have read many books by ""New Age"" types describing their experiences with the paranormal. This is unquestionably the most compelling and well written of those books. Ms. McCannon tells a biography of sorts outlining her experiences with guardian angels, healing angels, teaching angels, and out of body experiences. Other people have written on these subjects but this is the first book that took me by the hand and let me ""see"" and ""feel"" what was happening. The writing style is conversational -- you feel that the writer is sitting in the room with you telling her story. There were moments that made me laugh and others when I had to put the book down until I stopped crying. I recommend this book for anyone who needs to get back in touch with the wonder they knew when their world was full of magic and they were certain that fairies were real."
2,A great opportunity missed,"This could have been a brilliant book - the subject certainly has spectacular prospects - but it was not to be. Fifty years on there are few survivors of the legions of the Kempeitai, and even fewer survivors of their victims. It could have been a timely piece of scholarship. Instead we are treated a poor collection of anecdotes which lack suffcient breadth and analysis to be evidence of anything other than the incidents they describe, not the Kempeitai as a whole, nor their operations. More disappointing is the author's unconcealed antipathy towards his subject, as a result of his father's wartime experiences. If you need a book on the subject then consider buying it, but otherwise look elsewhere."
4,An Important chronicle of World War II History.,"The author talks more about atrocities than the counter intelligence role that the organization played. The only intelligence type stuff they discuss is the Ricard Sorge(Soviet Master Spy in Germanys Tokyo Embassy) capture and interogation. The author does catelouge the atrocities committed by this organization well though(Hence the title Japan's dreaded military police). The author explains the disgusting things that this organization did like make sex slaves out of Korean and other Western Women captured by them during the war, decapitating allied airmen, biological experiments on POW's, stuffing prisoners in Bambooe baskets and liteing them on fire. He also explains the sickining fact that many in this organization went unpunished."
2,"Very dry, and very uninteresting.","The writer is a serial author, who claims to have close to 50 books published. Although the topic is very important and few writers have tackled this subject, he makes it very uninteresting. The Kempeitai killed many American POWs and experimented on bacterial agents with jailed inmakes. These are also the guys who kidnapped women in conquered countries to serve as comfort women to the Japanese armed forces.The shortcomings of this book are many. Perhaps a few more established true stories about how and why prisoners suffered. The author tries to tell the organizational side of this terrorist organization and spends more time using the Japanese words to describe the various ranks. This could have been a good to great book."
3,There is depth in this book,"Hi, I just finished reading ""Six Ways to Pray from Six Great Saints"" by Gloria Hutchinson. It is a small (152 pages) devotional prayer book that draws upon the lives and prayer practices of Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola, Therese of Lisieux, Teresa of Avila, and John of the Cross. I found myself taking a week for each of these saints in my evening prayer time. This is not a long book, nor is it a difficult book to read. However, there is depth in this book and I found the exercises meaningful. This is not an intellectual exploration of these figures and their practices. It is at its heart a prayer book to be prayed and not just read. For me, in this context, it accomplished its goal. At some point I hope to revisit this book as I feel that I did grow through the experience.Pastor Gregory Pierce"
2,too expensive for what it was,I thought there would be more value in this book than what there was. I would not recommend at that price.
3,Not my favorite,"I liked the story, but the way he wrote the dialogue between the characters was too hard to read. I don't think I would recommend it."
5,A superb work of atonement theology,"I am a professor of theology with an interest in the doctrine of the atonement. I recommend this book very highly. It draws on Rene Girard's anthropological theory of violence, interprets key passages from the Bible, surveys the history of atonement thought, touches on historical examples of violence such as slavery, and presents a constructive theological and ethical perspective on atonement. I wish I could make this book required reading for all seminarians."
3,Thought provoking but conservative,"I liked this book up to a point but felt it was conservative and could have taken the subject in another direction more meaningful to me. The concept of sacrifice was very meaningful to people of that time but is not a meaningful concept for us. About the only way we can use the word ""sacrifice"" is for someone who puts himself in harm's way to save others. Jesus certainly did that."
3,Just so-so,"For the price, you really can't complain. Having said that...If your towels are hefty at all, they will not fit well in the bottom two slots of this rack. You have to smash them in, and it's difficult to get them out.If you're just using it as decoration, no problem. If your towels are reeeally lightweight, no problem. Otherwise, plan on using it for hand towels."
5,My best DVD collection so far!,"This box set is, by far, my most favorite. Not just because it includes my favorite movie of all time, REAR WINDOW, but because it includes a great combination of Hitchcock's greatest works. You definatly get your money's worth in this deal. This is an excellent box set to either start your DVD collection with, or add to your collection with. Enjoy!"
1,It costs ...,"There are 7 DVDs plus an Extra Episodes DiscSo, that is like 7.5 movies....These may be very good movies. But, they cost a lot for what you get."
4,A FEROCIOUS FARCE,"Chris Morris co-wrote and directed a very dark, shockingly wicked, tour de force about four inept British would-be suicide bomber jihadists. This ferocious farce grabbed me immediately. Terrorism can be as much about idiots as ideology. Here's a brilliant film that does not flinch or blink in the face of the horrific reality of our times. Can urgent truth be funny? Yes. Time called it ""The blackest, ballsiest political comedy since DR. STRANGELOVE."" Can mockery and ridicule dilute hate? Maybe. Maybe not. But laughter sure can. Is Allah laughing?"
4,"A very wrong movie, but very enjoyable","This black comedy charts the life of a group of would-be terrorists living in London. If you have any reservations about the subject matter it is best to steer clear, if however you are good with a satirical lampooning of a serious subject this movie will have you laugh hard at several moments.Very well acted, really interesting characters and I don't want to say anything more about the plot as I think it is best as a surprise."
4,UK's history-in-making,"A story is about the modern UK accelerating Islamizing: not-so-fanny, rather satiric smart depiction of domestic terror growth as hungry-for-cheap-lackeys grant in increasing numbers visas to predominantly anti-western migrants spreading domestic customs round the globe [...] .Actually, it is hard to comment ""parodies"" on the history (see my comment on My Name is Nobody http://www.amazon.com/My-Name-Nobody-Terence-Hill/dp/B0007M21Z8/ref=cm_cr-mr-img ) while this particular kingdom had already been experienced in suiting the faith for crown's needs (The Tudors)."
2,NEAAAA,PREVIEW WAS 1 OF THE MOST FUNNIEST THINGS I EVER SAW BUT MOVIE WAS LONG BORING PARTS WITH PREDICABLE FUNNY SENS. BUT MY UNCLE A DESERT STORM NAVY VET LOVED IT. YOUR CHOICE.
5,Incredibly funny movie!,"Very very very funny in a slightly dark way since it is dealing with a very serious subject - radical jihadihsts... Somewhat hard to understand the heavy British accents, but well worth watching... HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!!"
4,Hilarious!,"Very funny! A true ""how to"" video for wannabe Taliban terrorists! Not for people with no sense of crude humor."
4,Engrossing,"When I picked up MILLENNIUM RISING I expected a cash-in-on-the-year-2000 disaster novel, but author Jane Jensen does a considerably better job than that in her account of a global apocalypse apparently triggered by the wrath of God. A Vatican skeptic is Jensen's unlikely protagonist--a Catholic priest who is dispatched by the Pope to debunk reports of miracles. But in this case he isn't sure whether he's looking at the world's biggest fraud, or the genuine apocalypse. This is quite an engrossing book, although like many disaster novels it surges and crashes on just a bit too long, and events eventually stretched my suspension of disbelief past the breaking point. (Please, would somebody write a global disaster novel that does NOT prominently feature the U.S. President! ) Still, not a bad read, and interesting for some of its observations about religious zealotry."
5,"Slightly biased, but I loved this book.","I am slightly biased in the matter as I have been a fan of Jensen for some time. I was very impressed with this book. It was a good thriller. It was good Sci-fi. It was also a Jensen story which meant that was just the beginning. Jane knows how to tell a story. It had been a long time since I had gotten so involved in a story that I was really scared. Most of the time I could not put this book down. There were however several instances where I dropped it and had to pace around the room to calm myself down before I could continue reading it. I could not not finish the book though. Read this book, you won't regret it. Please keep writing, Jane. I look forward to your work."
3,I was disapointed,"Let me preface this by saying that I loved Ms Jensen's Gabriel Knight games because of their plot, and have read, and enjoyed her GK books. The begining of Millenium Rising (or Judegement Day, as it is called now) is riveting, engaging, and suspensful. There are times when the believabilty of the plot is questionable, but nowhere as bad as the ending is. I could not swallow the ending. It felt rushed, and it didn't fit well with the rest of the story. I wanted to like it, and I look forward to Ms Jensen's future work (Dante's Passage, I believe is her next work). But I can't see me recomending this book to others, nor wanting to read it again."
4,This book rocks!,"This is a must have, don't think twice, you can't go wrong with this one...., save me a lot of time passing USMLE 1, don't waste your time reading 800+ pages with NMS review collection... this one and First aid are a killer combination!!"
1,About as much depth as a newspaper headline.,"It is clear that this book is not meant for those taking the boards exam seriously. Even if you had full access to this book during the exam, you would likely not fare well as it simply does not cover the material to the level that a medschool student truly needs to pass the boards exam.This is like Alice in Wonderland meets the boards, only this time you are Mr. Rabbit."
2,Not Enough,"This book is only sufficient for the less weighted items for the USMLE boards. There is just not enough depth for a lot of the things covered by the boards. Also, there are quite a few errors in here, and no errata published by Princeton Review. That means that everything written in it must be checked elsewhere and confirmed before it is useful. On the plus side, for a broad and nonspecific overview of topics like gross anatomy, genetics and immunology, the book did a good job. However, they billed themselves as a comprehensive study guide, and they just fell short of that claim."
4,THIS BOOK IS REALLY WORK,"This book proof to work with many people who take the test and had a previous medical knowldge during their study in the first 2 year,at least it work for me and I score 89 in my exam."
4,"Wonderful characters, great fun.","Mr. Hanson's off-beat sense of humor continues to exibit itself in this second ""Adam McCleet"" mystery. There is a definite sense of fun in his books which makes murder merry. I especially enjoyed the ""death squad"""
3,Should be categorized as YA,"This book was OK. Other people have pointed out the lack of character development and the obvious plot, along with the nice creation of a world and the atmosphere within it. I felt strongly that this book is most appropriate for Young Adults, and should be both marketed & shelved that way."
2,Kind of a yawner,"I have enjoyed some of Douglass' books, but I found this one to be a disappointment. There was never any character development - the main character was the same at the end as he'd been at the beginning. There was never any suspense - the outcome was never in doubt for a second. For example, when proof of the prince's identity is needed, someone shows up within minutes (it felt like that short a time, at least), with the only object that could prove the prince's identify in his pocket.While the book kept me busy for a couple hours it didn't have me riveted to my chair. I kept hoping that there'd be some real action, or some reason to actually care what happened next, but nothing ever really developed. I was sorry I'd spent money on it, as I doubt I'll read it again. Save your money and wait for the paperback if your library doesn't have this book on the shelf."
1,This paper is too thin,"I used it on my Epson Photo 960 using the ""Glossy Photo Paper"" option as the paper type (this could have had something to do with it). The photos were very wrinkled up due to the thinness of the paper. Better to go with Premium Glossy paper or Premium Semi-gloss. Theres a big difference."
1,Such a stupid machine,"the idog was great, but the idog pup is not.You can't do mp3 playing come out of him or nothing.I suggest u buy an idog white, or black, they're better than this piecem."
2,Not worth it,"This book has too much primary information that can easily be found in any cheaper business start-up book and too little information that is insightful to salon start-ups. The workbook didn't arrive with the original shipment, nor with the replacement shipment- but I doubt that it could make the purchase any more valuable. Look elswhere for a salon-specific guide book."
2,Very little New Content,"I loved Braha's first book ""Ancient Hindu Astrology for the Modern Western Astrologer"". This work is one-half a rehash of the first book and in the first half has some additional interpretation on transits. I did not find that all that useful to the money paid for the book. Take his first book if you are an absolute beginner - it is great...pass on this one"
4,Great set with tons of playing time,All three games are a ton of fun if you like the Need for Speed series. You just can't beat this price!
4,Best racing games,these games are the best.. i dont know about need for speed underground 1 cause i never played it.. only on my xbox but most wanted and underground 2 are the best. they defenently top need for speed carbon and need for speed pro street. i was very disappointed in need for speed pro street.. i rented it with gamefly and played for about 30 mins and stopped. graphics are pretty bad on it too.i currently own need for speed carbon..its kind of ok.. i mean the cars and customizations. this is a must buy.. great offer.. i had most wanted before but i lost it.. and underground 2 i borrowed from a friend couldnt stop playin .. love the blacklist on most wanted.... MUST BUY!!!
2,book was not in good condition,"the book was not in good condition. very dissappointed, cover was torn in different spots as well as multiple pages inside the book."
4,Moderate frills with a new set of characters,"This Playstation 2 version of Super Bust-A-Move isn't really ""super"" in that it doesn't offer any upgrades compared to the previous versions on the PS1 and other older consoles.The main difference is that you get a new set of characters and the graphics is tweaked a bit(but not by much). If you've played any previous versions, then you know what to expect.The gameplay is still fun and offers up that classic Bust-A-Move feel. It would have been nice to see some true upgrades but otherwise this is still a solid puzzle game that you can play against the computer or a human player."
4,Quality labels,"There's really not a lot to say about these labels. They do exactly what I want them to do. I got them to use for return address labels, and for that they are perfect. They are just the right size, and they print well. You could also use them for the main address label if your recipient's address is short enough.Recommended."
3,address return labels,"You can't use these for anything except return labels because they are so small. Be sure to position them where you want them the first time because if you don't & try to remove them to place them better they will tear & stick partially to the envelope. These did not jam even running through 100 pages at a time to print on my Konica Minolta laser jet color printer. I loved the online FREE help for getting the temp plate made & they also enclosed a toll free number to call for FREE help,can't beat that. I gave them 3 stars because of the help available, other wise I would have given them one star, the paper itself is very cheap."
4,"Print well, but top margin isn't right","These labels print well in my HP LaserJet 3200, and they peel off easily, but they print a little too far down the page, as compared with the old model #5267 labels, and the top line of the label prints higher and higher as the labels go down the page, so about 1/4 of the labels at the bottom of the sheet have their top line cut off. It may be that this is a printer issue, however."
5,Return Address Labels,These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification.
4,Good labels but beware of printing problems,"The labels are fine - they peel and stick with ease. However, I wasted a few sheets because the print would not line up properly. The instructions say to use Avery template 5267 but this does not work. After some experimenting and waste of product, I found that 5167 works the best."
4,Reasonably priced labels that do the job,"Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. They're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case, packages or envelopes. I'm taking away one star because they're harder to use in the printer than they should be. It's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly. Granted, part of that is my own fault. But these should be easier to use. However, overall it's a fine product."
4,Great Labels Work As Advertised,"These labels are great. They line up perfectly in Microsoft Word, and they print right every single time. Use them constantly."
3,It's OK,"Dymo labels are what they are. A bit pricey for large volume uses, but they do what they are supposed to.The product was left on the doorstep of our shopping center business after hours in plain site of whoever might have driven by. Fortunately it was not stolen. The shipping label is cryptic - unable to determine the shipper, though I suspect it is Fedex Ground.I may stop getting this product if this is how it is going to be shipped. I'll pay an extra dollar to have it delivered by a better shipper."
3,Senseo pods,"I've been using them for years. Not as good as fresh perked coffee but the next best thing -- easy, clean and the coffee's acceptable."
3,Flimsy Lids,"I bought this yogurt maker about a year ago and have used it almost weekly since then. It is a very basic machine and easy to use. Overall, I am satisfied with it. However, the lids start to crack and break with regular use. When I contacted the company for replacements (couldn't find replacements anywhere else!!) I was told that it would be $18 per lid to replace! I am now in the market for a machine that will come with some customer service, if needed, and with more sturdy containers."
1,lemon-y goodness,"Two of the seven jars came broken, and after cooking yogurt (which, frankly, did not come out particularly deliciously), the second jar I opened broke as well. I am not a she-hulk, and I successfully use glasses and other fragile items each day without their shattering in my hands. However, this comes out to 3/7 of the jars breaking right away or almost right away. At this rate, I'll be lucky to get one more batch of yogurt out of this. I'm going to be returning this immediately."
3,Good but FYI-replacement jars are no longer available!,We bought this for Christmas last year and have really enjoyed using it. It has a 1 yr warranty HOWEVER when I called to get replacement lids (2 cracked) and a jar they told me that the jars are no longer available. I cannot even find them on ebay. Bummer. I think this is an important thing to consider when making a choice so Im just putting it out there. Im not sure what Im going to do to replace mine. I guess buy a new maker!
4,Salton Yogurt Maker Is Very Good,"I am making yogurt for the first time on this Salton product, and it is performing exactly as described. For the price, it's a winner."
2,Broken jars,"I have to echo the complaints of several reviewers about the fragility of the glass cups. After chilling the yogurt and removing the lids from several of the jars, I broke off a large shard of glass. Are the lids simply too tight? Why aren't the jars Pyrex? This is a terrible problem. The yogurt maker itself works all right when the desired yogurt recipe is used. But what good is the delicious yogurt if the glass shatters when you want to use the yogurt?"
4,Great but ... replacement lids/jars not available,"The yogurt maker itself works great, is simple to use and produces great yogurt.Do not let run for more than 10 hours though, the yogurt starts tasting tart beyond that.It could use some sort of a timer, but with a little planning this is OK, making yogurt is kind of 1 day project anyway.You need to pay strong attention to mixing the ingredient evenly otherwise the taste may vary significantly from one jar to the next.What prevents me to rate this 5 stars is the fact that the lids are not dishwasher safe, and on second batch one of the plastic lids melted during the drying process.Turns out that replacement parts are not available from the vendor anymore.Substitutes range from 8oz canning jars (at amazon, meijer etc) if you're ok with metallic lids, to eurocuisine screw top jars. The latter should deliver next week for me."
2,2 jars broken in two weeks? Buy a different yogurt maker!,"The yogurt is indeed delicious, and the machine works quite well. The glass jars, though, aren't tempered like Pyrex, so they don't respond well to the combination of temperature changes and tight-sealing plastic lids. One jar chipped, a section about the size of my thumb, when I peeled the lid off a few mornings after I made the second batch. I thought I must have been too eager to get the thing open, or that I put pressure on it from just the wrong angle. When another split all the way to the base after the fourth batch, I realized the glass jars just aren't a good idea. Maybe another brand or model's glass jars are sturdier? I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend this model."
2,badly designed lid,"The lid is lightweight, flimsy, & irregular in shape which makes it slip off easily and since it's clear, it's difficult to tell that it's not closed all the way. There's no handle on the lid to hang onto, so when it slips off, be careful it doesn't drop onto the floor & crack or shatter. The yogurt turned out just fine, but I suggest buying a different design."
1,JR Cancelled the order.,I ordered this yogurt maker for 19.99 and with Amazon Prime sold by JR. Waited for 10 days to get it shipped. Now JR called me this morning telling the company stopped manufacturing. I came to Amazon and voila.. this is being sold here for 29.99 by another seller and no mention of company stopped manufacturing. Within a week? Did the company really stopped making it or each seller is just selling their stock. I am loyal Amazon customer for many years but this is not a good way to serve. I see other people just got this recently from Amazon. Better check the stock with seller before you buy.
1,cups break easily,"This product did a good job making yogurt. However, after I made my first batch, one of the cups shattered in my hands as I was opening it. As another reviewer said, I'm a small person, and I manage to use glass items all the time w/o breaking them, so I don't think it's me. I have returned this item and ordered a different yogurt maker. I would not recommend this item because the cups break so easily."
4,Very impressed,"I have made 2 batches of yogurt with this machine using Yogurmet starter, which I bought at a local healthfood store, and whole organic milk. I followed the instructions on the yogurt starter and had no problems. The yogurt comes out very creamy and reminds me of Dannon with the fruit on the bottom, except I took fresh blueberries and strawberries cooked down with a little honey and placed the fruit with syrup on top. My only disappointment was that I paid $17 for expedited shipping and it took 4 days to receive it. I recieved a few other items that I ordered the same night by regular delivery 2 days earlier, but I am very happy with the machine."
3,Salton Yogurt Maker review,"The product operates fine - it works! My one complaint is that the lid does not quite fit properly, and even so, the device runs a little warmer than it should (Around 120 degrees F instead of 110 degrees F). I think it's a little over-priced at around $50 for its quality, but I was in a hurry to get the product. A more reasonable price would be about $30."
5,Mom's Chocolate,The product arrived fresh and tasty. It was ordered for my mom but she was terminally ill & did not get to eat any. I shared it with other family members in her memory. Thank you Amazon for helping me get what my mom requested when I wasn't able to leave her to shop.
5,Always Appreciated,"I've brought this Godiva Chocolate Gift Box to three birthday parties in the last two months. Each time, when the birthday girl (all three parties happened to be for ladies) saw the box, her eyes lit up and the box was quickly stashed away. After all, who doesn't love Godiva Chocolates? And I certainly can't blame them for not wanting to share! In a pinch, Godiva is a most appreciated gift."
2,Suprised,"Ive had many Godiva Chocolates so I was very surprised with this box, it was almost entirely made up of low quality chocolate. There was little flavor and no richness, this assortment made Hersheys taste good and thats pretty bad. It was disappointing at best. I love Godiva and so this box was a real surprise. Id say pass and go for a truffle assortment over this."
2,Better late than never,While the chocolates were tasty the fact that they reached over a week late for a birthday order was highly disappointing. The seller was good at correcting the issue after I notified him that it was running late but for $40 chocolates one doesnt expect to have to follow-up on shabby delivery.
3,Sweet story,"Nice follow up from Fate, a widow learns that life can and does give you more than one soul mate and its best to never say never (as in I will never marry again) especially when you are still a young woman of 28 and attracted to your new neighbour. It was good to have the secondary characters (The Lewis family, Vanessa and Scott)without them dominating the story and its obvious that T.J will continue to be a thorn in this families side.I only give it 3.5 stars cos once again the love scenes are quite tame compared to other titles in this genre."
1,why bother?,"Another impenetrable text from this author.Too bad, it was so unnecessary as the subjecteasily lends itself to user friendly exposition."
2,Pay attention to dates.,"This was a valuable resource once, back towards the beginning of the internet. It's basically a collection of addresses for criminal justice sites, coupled with instructions on how to use Usenet and Netscape. Good luck getting any of those addresses to work, though; this book is more than ten years out of date.I forgot to look for the date, and wasted a couple dollars on shipping this."
4,Very handy book,"A pocket book on Respiratory Track Infections, detailed explanations of four-five infections of the respiratory track. Starting with pneumonia, which is more than half of the book due to variations and than cough and cold. A book to read and carry around for quick reference for it has differential diagnosis and treatment."
5,"Real men, real friends","Virginia Bobinson's newly published book of poetry, carrier, models poetry as ""surgical strike."" The images the poet draws of her friendships with Navy SEALS reveal multidimensional humans who also function as highly skilled military officers. While fleshing out her much loved military friends in ordinary, tragic and domestic daily scenes, the poet provides the reader opportunities for the healing of personal and national division. The reader begins to see and understand the SEALS as they laugh, love, die and peel tomatoes.Robinson's understanding and facility with the language of nature and science contribute to the impact of some of her almost haiku-like poems.Her imagery is clear, soft and powerful - as and when it needs to be.The poems of carrier are illuminating, touching and of contemporary importance. Carrier reminds me of how powerful poetry can be."
4,Great Video,My son is 9 years old and has a Powell board. We have enjoyed all the Powell products including this Video.
2,What in Hell?,"What in Hell is wrong with the AH sets? Why do we have to buy the same movies that are REPEATED the each box set. It's bad enough that we suffer at the hands of studio's that keep adding supposedly ""newly found"" extras. I Love extras but being ""Force to get the new material each time is outraegous.I have three versions of Star wars and two or three of the Godfather.Several of the same movies are repeated in the box sets.Watch out,you are being taken advantaged of. Bummer . . . ."
1,Pressure gage does not work,The design is good but the pressure gage is not working. I brought this to inflate all my tires and the convenience of a built in gage make it easy to see how much PSI I was putting in. Unfortunately the tire pressure gage does not work.
2,Just did not work,Probably was in the production process. Was not worth sending it back. You can try it & it may work fine for you.
1,Pressure Guade does not work,The reason I bought this was the built in pressure gauge which reads 10 psi higher than the actual pressure. Its not worth returning because of the shipping. Just disgusted with it.
3,Gauge reading questionable,Works fine but I do not put too much faith in gauge readings. Otherwise it seems to be a well made product that should give years of service.
1,"Cool looking, but....","It's a shame, this would look very cool in your ps2 slim if it wouldn't keep peeling off, the adhesive isn't strong enough to hold it to the surface. Maybe this is because the intention was to make it ""reusable"". It would work if it was just a plain sticker with no ""padding"". Also, the padding adds extra thickness to the ps2 so it looks a bit bulkier and not as slim as before. I trew this away the second day I purchased it because it was collecting dust at the not-so-sticky side, reducing even more the sticky features. All other ""skins"" could possibly have the same problem. Stay away from this unless you are willing to use extra adhesives."
4,Good reference,"Eyewitness always does a great job. Nice reference, but too big and heavy to carry on the trip."
1,Useless,"This book tries to say something about every place in the entire country, and in doing so, says nothing about anything. It gave no recommendations of worthwhile sites vs tourist traps, etc. It was a waste of money."
3,Australia by DK Publishing,"The actual weight of this book is too much for lightweight travellers. Great photos and descriptions but will read, make notes and leave this book at home. Another book selection for actual travel will probably be Fodors."
2,Shiny,"This is a good looking book but disappointed us, somehow there wasn't a lot of useful information in it compared to other guide books! We sold it when we got back."
3,just decent,"I was letdown after all the good reviews this book received.The layout is good, it is easy to read and there is a lot of useful information in the book. The letdown for me was that all the restaurants and bars listed are expensive so this isn't very helpful for the budget conscious. BUT this book is way better that the Rough Guides or Lonely Planet. However I will be ordering Frommers to take with me when I go to Australia..."
3,"OK, but.......","I live in Australia and wanted a nice guide, and have always been drawn to the DK travel books with their lush photos, beautifully illustrated maps, building cut aways etc. In addition, this book was the 2006 version, latest update and later than many of its competitors.As another reviewer has noted, all these photos and illustrations come at a price, which is lack of detail. In addition, I am not sure how rigorous the update process is. For example, the 2006 version does not cover the most significant new building in Brisbane, the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), which cries out for inclusion in such a guide. This building was completed in 2006 and under construction for some years before.Probably best as a supplementary guide or photo history of your travel."
4,Lots of Info?,"This book has a great deal of good information for travel in Australia. Unfortunately, as is the case in most travel books. if the area you are interested in is one ""less traveled"" you may be disappointed in the scanty information supplied. In this case my chosen destination is the Northern Territories, particularly Darwin.Once again my observation holds true. The descriptions are brief and limited. Not surprising. Not even my Aussie friends have traveled into the area. Wish buying a book would supply the info I seek. It really does require deeper research which on it's own can be fun."
4,Useful but not quite what was expected,"The change management pocket guide provides some excellent forms for those already familiar with the process. Some forms are obscure and may be less useful. Rather than forms, dedicating some of the guide to step by step procedures would have been more useful. The guide would be highly useful to an HR specialist rather than an engineer trying to develop a method for evaluating how his workforce will be affected by a change.Overall, this book will be useful.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
5,Handy guide,This pocket guide provides serious resources for change management. It's easy to duplicate the assessments and forms and educates you on how and when to use them. A must for anyone new to change management.
4,A great tool for change managers,"The Change Management Pocket Guide is a great tool for all change managers. The tools it contains are easy to use and... useful! If you are using change management in your work, this is a very useful book to have."
4,handy guide on the basics,this is a really useful explination on methods and techniques for business change. Useful as an aid memoire. It could be a little more comprehensive in some areas but I will be using it extensively
2,Pocket size,It really is a little (tiny) pocket size book. I was expecting something larger for the price.
5,Great Color,I loved this hair color. It's very natural looking. It left my hair shinny and looking great. I don't have a lot of gray but it covered the ones I do have. I will be buying this color again.
3,Roots and eyebrows didn't take.,"I'm naturally a dark blonde, but about 6 months ago I bleached my hair to a lighter blonde shade. I bought this color because it looked beautiful online and I wanted to darken my hair for winter.The results are a little mixed. I put the dye on my roots and bangs first, then finished with the rest of my hair. I left it on for 30 minutes total, and used a q-tip to apply the dye to my eyebrows for 15. After the 30 minutes were up, I rinsed until the water ran clear and applied the conditioner, left that on for 5 minutes, and rinsed again. I'm happy to say that most of my hair is the pretty brown pictured in the photo.. but my roots and eyebrows (that have never been dyed) are much lighter than the rest of my hair. They have a copper-ish look to them that I don't care for. I'm going to use Sally's purple shampoo to try to get the copper color out, so hopefully it will look more natural in a couple of weeks."
5,The Scent From a Woman,"Fresh White Musk by Prince Macchiavelli is a reasonably-priced cologne with an indescribably good scent. Its lighter than musk oil but like musk, it blends well with a woman's body heat to create an earthy yet light fragrance that will surely entice and stimulate. I don't know why its so difficult to find in retail stores-"
4,Very helpful but...,"It's the common list of questions and answers. Full of things you won't even need to remember nor get asked. However, it is an excellent travel book and something to always have ready for those long periods of nothing to do. I just can't help but fall asleep after a chapter or two, or find that my brain can only retain so much. Very well written and easy to understand."
1,Do not buy this,The video quality is horrible it is only 10 min long and the cost is not worth this dvd. I gather this is originally geared for travel agencys free promo of egypt why is amazon selling this? It hardley explains the history of saqqara or memphis at all . Do not buy .
3,Didn't live up to the title,"I am totally agreeable that larger sized women are sexy and very romantic. So, I was excited to see this book on the library's shelf. Unfortuantly, it didn't live up to my expectations. The short stories were sweet, but not really developed. It's a nice light read, but I it left me wanting to know more about the characters and how other"
3,If you are in to romance.....,"If you are in to strictly romance with no reality this is the book for you.Rochelle Alers, Donna Hill, Brenda Jackson and Francis Ray are all talented and successful authors, but these stories did not really catch me. I rushed through the book just to finish it.Reunion by Rochelle Alers was okay. Friends lose touch and 25 years later they reconnect after one of them gets divorced, I will have to leave you there....Surprise by Donna Hill.......oh boy. Check this out, over 50 years old and pregnant, need I say more.Bare Essentials by Brenda Jackson.....just a little bit of reality in that one.Strictly Business by Francis Ray....Almost 30 year old female and you're a virgin...ok possible, but you meet a man and 5 weeks later you marry him because you are scared that you are going to lose him to another woman if you go on you're plan trip to Rome............I heard of shotgun weddings but dayum!!!!I really did expect more from these authors.Later....."
2,Expensive nail polish,"I had an allergy to my watch. The nickel test from this product came up empty. Maybe there is no nickel in my watch, that's OK. But I do have an allergy of some sort, so I applied the ""protect"" solution to the watch. The protecting solution smells exactly like nail polish. The allergy came back in a few days but maybe I did not apply the protecting solution thoroughly enough. If I had to do it all over again, I would have simply gotten nail polish and applied it to my watch."
3,I am not sure if this works,"I know I am sensitive to nickel and had bought a pair of silver earrings recently. The result when wearing them is the severe allergic reaction I get when wearng anything with a nickel content. So, I found this test kit, which arrived quickly and securely packaged. The bottle that contains a clear liquid smealls like it is amonia. You place several drops of this liquid on a q-tip swab, then rub on the metal item for 20 to 30 seconds. A pink color is supposed to develop on the swab if it is possitive for nickel. I tested the earrings in question and a grayish-slightly pink color developed, and I am not sure what that means. If something tests positive, there is a bottle of a clear nail varnish to apply to the jewelry piece to prevent a nickel reaction. I dont' know what you would do about a reaction to the nail varnish, though.There is nothing else on the market for consumers to test for nickel and I really can't say that this product is effective."
5,Adorable,We bought this book so my husband could read to our son! It is an aboslutely adorable book about a father and child and the love they have for one another!
3,"cute, in a strange, unexplainable way","I bought this for my daughter to give to my husband/her dad on Father's Day this year. She seems to like it, and enjoys when he reads it to her. It is a short, straightforward story that is easy for her to follow, and she likes to point out all the little spiders and grasshoppers lurking in the corners of every page.I find the illustrations to be quite goofy, and not so easy of the eyes, as the characters are all so raw and odd looking - so it's appeal is sort of lost on me. But, it gets it's point across, showing a special time spent between a dad and his child, so I guess it serves it's purpose. : )"
3,"Cute, but I had higher expectations","I thought this would make a great gift for my husband because we are expecting a son. The book was ok, but not great."
2,"OK book, but not all that great","Little Critter and his father went camping. When they found a campsite, they got ready to go fishing. When Little Critter caught a fish, Dad took a picture of it. They were getting ready to eat the fish when a big bear got it and took it away. If you like camping, this is the book for you."
5,"Great book, great quality!","Great book, great quality! This is one of my favorites - a total classic! I highly recommend this book - !"
5,Wonderful story of special times,Again Mercer Mayer has captured a special moment full of it's ups and downs. Along with his beautiful art work this book is a joy to read with your little one. My children seem to enjoy the special characters that are along for the trip also. See if your little one can find them as you read. Little Critter always portrays the curiosity and eagerness of children and the funny mishaps that come from that curiosity and eagerness. I have loved Mercer Meyer since I was a child and enjoy that my children do too!
4,One of my favorites as a kid,Mighty Heroes was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid growing up. An offbeat collection of improbably superheroes that would leap into action at the sign of trouble. This is one thing that will probably spark some fun memories for baby boomers! It is a shame that these cartoons are out of print now.
3,Only SIX Cartoons?,"The picture on the Amazon site says ""The Complete Series""' but the VHS tape I received contains only six episodes. I guess I should have looked closer at the picture, which actually says DVD on the cover.As of this date (01/2010) The Mighty Heroes have not been officially released on DVD. The picture is from an ""unauthorized"" collection not available on Amazon. A Google search will probably pull up the place to get the DVD. But come on, TerryToons, give us an official DVD of The Mighty Heroes! It would be great to see a fully restored version of these historically significant* cartoons!I'm not disappointed, as I only paid $1.99, but that picture of the DVD cover should be removed to avoid any further consumer confusion.*(This series was conceived on the spot at a TerryToons - CBS story pitch meeting by a junior-animator, after CBS had rejected all the other pitch ideas. The execs liked the idea, and the junior-animator was put in charge of the project. His name was Ralph Bakshi.)"
1,The Mighty Zeroes,It's a mediocre cartoon at best. The heroes are 1D and have no real defining character outside their powers. They are also very accident prone. The villians are also 1D and forgettable because the show only uses them only 1 time. The animation is not great but pretty good. Every episode is predictable and has no real surprises. The jokes are kind-of funny but none of them came from the leads. There are no life lessons or any messages for that matter. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.
2,Flimsy product.,"Its made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on. I'm afraid to put a heavy book on there, because I'm sure the parts will just snap off."
2,Not For Text Books,"This stand may be good for pamphlets, ring-bound manuals, magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books. It is unstable and the page holders can't hold any page open for even a nano second. Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand orMighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holderinstead."
5,This is a 1L must have,"Im in my second semester of law school and I cant say enough bout this product. Whenever I read for my classes i've always had to lean over my books which placed a terrible strain on my neck, especially when I have 4+ hours worth of reading. Now when I read for my classes I'm significantly more comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product for an incoming law student."
5,Large book stand,"This is useful when trying to see both the reference books and use the computer. I was told I bent my neck too much, hurting it, and this holds things at just the proper angle."
4,It works =),The item was not what I was really expecting (I am still a little uncertain as to what exactly I was expecting) but I have found it to be really useful. It holds up my super mondo family history book that has over 900 pages with ease and I like the fact that you can adust the height so if I move from a place where the book needs to be pointed up more I can change it so it is easiest for me to read. I would reccomend this product for any who need something heavy like a text book or family history book (not a full unabridged dictionary big) that they are looking at or typing from.
5,Excellent for home or office,"Bought it for school after seeing my instructors. then I took the packaging to the college bookstore to suggest they carry them instead of the flimsy wire ones they had. They now stock them for student purchase. I used it in my classes, but now use it at home and have one for the office as well."
4,Decent bookholder for the price,"I bought this as a present for my friend who likes to read. It performs according to advertisement. That is, it does a decent job of holding larger books and the adjustability is nice. As mentioned in some of the negative reviews, the pegs do come of easily, but they can be put back on relatively easily too. Overall, it's still probably the best deal for the price range.Pros:- Good value- Holds open books of most sizes and style- Folds up into a nice compact piece of plastic that you can keep in your bag- Material seems sturdy (not the crack-able hard plastic)Cons:- Pegs fall off- Kind of difficult to adjust the height, but this doesn't need to be done too often"
4,does what it needs,"it does what it needs to do and how it was described, it is also very light so easy to carry around. I didn't give it full 5 star because I thought the quality is not that great, it could break anytime, but you get what you pay for if it does break."
5,Excellent!,"I love this product, it is easy to use, perfect to take it to school, since it folds and I can put in on my binder....I got it very fast from the vendor too. I ordered on Friday night and the product was here by the next Tuesday morning."
1,Flimsy book stand which cannot function as a book stand,"Even though the bookstand is made of fairly sturdy plastic, the page hooks (2 plastic flip ups to position the both pages on the stand when you position the book on the book stand) get loose after a few months of use. Now, it cannot even hold the page in place. What good does it do if I have to hold the page manually or put some make-shift item to position the page while using this book stand. I will go with more sturdier wire mesh type of book stand for the next purchase. I don't recommend this book stand because of the flimsy plastic flip-ups."
3,Poor Quality,"I receive the product in record time and it arrived in excellent condition.However, the quality of this copy holder is poor. It is very cheaply constructed."
4,Solid bookstand,"This bookstand is nice. It's not complicated and does a fine job of keeping books open. Handles ""light"" textbooks well and I have it holding my study bible open most of the time which is really big compared to the ""light"" textbooks that I also use it for.I have only one concern with this. The page holder clips are rather sharp and if you press them in all the way, sometimes it marks and scratches the pages, leaving the paper a little shorn. But if the book doesn't have a propensity to close itself, you can clip it just enough to keep it open and everything is fine. I did mark up a few pages of my bible though.I would definitely purchase this bookstand again for it's price ($11.95)."
1,Flimsy.,"Oddly enough i found this product on amazon while searching for something to replace it. I suppose i should warn people.This at best holds thin books. Anything that has any recoil (books that close themselves), and its uselss. im not talking spring loaded, just plain paper back books.The good:Adjustable, collapsable.The bad:rarely holds pages secure.easy to break.definitely not worth 11$. think i got mine for 5 at office depot."
4,"Fellowes Booklift Copyholder, Platinum 21100","If you need a book support at a great price, this is the one. This booklift keeps reading at a comfortable level."
5,very useful,"This is just what i was looking for. Ever since I bought it, it has been at my desk. Very useful for all those that like to have many documents at the desk at the same time."
4,Book Holder,I needed a way to keep books upright and this works for me. Seems to be doing fine with the large review books I am using it for.
5,Absolute NECESSITY for students!,"I have three of these bookstands! I'm in law school, and these bookstands make studying SO MUCH BETTER! I don't have to look down at the book and then up again to type and down again and up again... I have all my books on their stands so I can reference them easily! I used to get cramps in my neck from that back and forth motion, but now I don't! If you're a student, you definitely will want to invest in these!! They hold my 600-800 page books very well!"
2,"its okay product, but with a defect",One of the bottom click keeps coming out of the joint and doesnt stay in. Seems some serious flaw in the design.
2,"Cheap quality, overpriced","This is way overpriced for what you're getting. Yes it does the job, but when out of the box the fellowe's logo already fell off, and the tabs to hold your pages keep coming off it just gets annoying."
4,decent and useful,"This book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy, but so far it's holding up decently. The back stand uses two pieces, and is adjustable. There are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page. They are also a problem. I have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit.I can also see how a book larger than 2 inches in thickness can be an issue, as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep. I've not yet had to work with this (I use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time) with a book of that size, but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if I ever use it with a book of that size."
5,a good supplement,The book was laid out well and establishes a good flow with the reader. Contains helpful drawings and diagrams. This book is well suited for visual learners.
4,liked it allot,"I love the story the write is conveying, I have read several of hers. Which honestly is a first. Most of the time I read the first one and struggle to even finish the second book. I had no problems enjoying the stories I have read from this author."
3,BEWARE THE SHIPPING BOX AND COST,"THE PRODUCT....PHONE CORD, IS ON THE THIN SIDE COMPARED TO OTHERS I HAVE HAD. BUT THE SHIPPING COST WAS MORE THEN THE ITEM AND PUT IN A BOX BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD ATLEAST 25 OF THE CORDS AND I PAID FOR THIS OVER-SIZED BOX!!!"
3,Product review and customer service,"The product I ordered through Amazon came from Office Quarters and though it was not the right fit for my telephone, Office Quarters was very gracious in letting me return the product. Thanks for your prompt customer serviceRoz Hirshfield"
3,watch out for cables,"I purchased one of these from Amazon and returned it (after talking to Trendnet tech support) because it didn't work--tried 3 computers, 3 mice, 4 keyboards--got a replacement, and it had the same problems.I arranged a return (for refund) for the second one and then had a thought--perhaps the Trendnet 8 port KVM uses different KVM->computer cables than the 4 port I was replacing. The cables look the same--DB15 on the KVM end, DB15 and USB on the computer end. To shorten a painful story, you apparently can't use the same cables on the 8 port switch as you can on the 4 port switch. I'm too busy to look into all the details, but make sure that the cable you buy say that they will work with the switch that you buy...despite looking the same, they are not. Groan"
3,Wireless KB & Mice Need not Apply,"I have the KVM installed and working. I tried to use with a wireless keyboard and mouse and had constant issues with the keyboard and mouse ceasing function. with a regular keyboard and mouse it works fine, even using a PS/2 keyboard and a USB mouse, but wireless devices will not work properly. Also, you must have the item selected when you are booting it otherwise you will not be able to control the computer which means you have to manually power-up on a power failure instead of having systems set to auto-boot when power is restored. Has the standard hit scroll lock twice and then the number to switch between stations."
2,Broke after 2 years,"Pros:- It's 1/3 the price of most other 8-port USB KVMs on the market.Cons:- No on-screen display makes it harder to set up, use, and troubleshoot- It stopped working after 2 years of light use (tried resetting to factory defaults, still borked)"
3,punk en espanol,"si te gusta el rock punk este grupo es punk la musica es similar a la de grupos bad religion,down by law,com los temas politicos y reveldia en sus cansiones,tipico musica punk nesesitan un poco mas de melodia en sus canciones y afinar un poco mas su sonido,pero que digo esto es musica punk ruido y reveldia arriva el punkrock!"
2,"Love Got You Where I Want You, the rest is not-so-great.","Not impressed with the CD as a whole, but I was dying to get this song and I couldn't find it as a single, so I bought the whole CD for one song! But this song is good enough, I gave the whole CD two stars!"
2,Only One Good Song,"Here is another CD from Hell, you buy it because you really like one song ""Got You"" and all the rest is crap. The Flys have talent and a good sound, but only for that one good song. Also, the video that comes on when you play it on your computer is neat to see the first time, but then who really wants to see that every time you stick the cd in to play? Not that anyone would want to play this one very often. Sorry but this one is going to get traded in. Not worth the money I spent on it."
2,if a fly has no wings is it a walk,"The flys new one is constantly on the verge of taking off. The rhythms are a solid mix of several styles played well, but it comes off as slick and simple. By the time the chorus comes around you already know where the song is headed, musically and lyrically. The flys have a good mix of punk, ska, some swing and straight up pop, but every song sounds like one you've heard before. This CD was always on the verge of exciting me, but instead just came off as predicatable and boring. This CD has no loft and isn't worth the money."
4,A fresh new sound in the alternative music world.,The Flys bring a fresh new sound to the world of alternative music. With many different techniques they create a sound that has yet to be discovered by other bands. I highly recomend this album. If you don't please check these guys out on the DIsturbing behavior sound track.
4,Surfers Paradise,"""Got You"" was the song I obviously bought the album for, and to my surprise, it ended up being one of the top five best albums of 1999. This album is absolutely RAW! ""Holiday Man"" has the ""Rage Against the Machine"" feel to it, and it works. ""She's so Huge"" is super bobbin' your head material, and ""Gods of Basketball"" can't really be that good of a song - but it is!Buy it - open your mind - and enjoy!"
1,Horrible,This the worst cd i ever bought. Track 2 is a good song but the rest of the cd is just horrible. This band is just a 1 hit wonder and expect nothing more.
3,Just doesn't work.,"I bought the CD for ""Got you where I want you"" because it reminded me of my girlfriend. While I still love the song, the CD is polluted by stupid basketball references left and right. If you absolutely love a certain song, I would buy this but in my opinion The Flys are a classic one hit wonder."
3,Holiday Man gives mixed signals.,"All of us I could listen to ""Got You"" tirelessly... But I've never seen a band so erratic. The other songs on the album are hardly worth mentioning, and the pop-track ""Got You"" is only a glimmer of The Flys' awesome potential. I don't think ""Holiday Man"" is their best effort."
3,OK 90's L.A. Rap Rock,"Buy this CD for three songs: Got You (Where I Want You), Groove is Where You Find It, and Girls Are The Cruelest. All are excellent songs. Regrettably the rest go downhill from there. Fun band though to rediscover when the mayor opens the time capsule from the 1990's."
3,ok,"The Flys have got a lot of talent and i bought this cd for ""got you (where i want you"" and ""she's so huge."" i have come to like ""gods of basketball"" and ""give u my car"" but the other songs are pretty cheesy"
3,"""Got You (Where I Want You)"" is an awesome song!!","Holiday Man by The Flys is a pretty average CD. I love the song ""Got You (Where I want You). I bought the whole CD just for that song. I was impressed with the rest of their songs, they have some good lyrics and beats. The world needs to wake up and discover The Flys, they are about to take off!"
3,I think my three stars pretty much says it all.,"I really like the song ""Got you where I want you"", however it is certainly no indication of what the rest of the cd contains just as it was with Everlast ""Whitey Ford Sings the Blues"". I bought that for the song ""What it's like"" and don't care much for the rest of it."
2,Could be better,"I think the first two songs were really good , but then the album just went downhill."
2,I liked one song and thats about it they need to mix their b,it lacks a lot. I expected something bette
1,WHAT IS THIS?,DO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CD. THERE R TO GOOD SONGS WHICH ARE THE FIRST 2 BUT THAT IS IT
3,"Good, but antiquated","This is a fine translation of the Lutheran confessions, which are excellent and should be studied and applied. However the time for this translation has come and gone; Kolb/Wengert and the Concordia Readers version are both better options for today's reader."
5,delicious snack,"ASIN: B000F4EUAM Let,s Do Organic Jelly Gummi Bears,3,5-Ounce Boxes.We started to buy these bears 6 months ago for my daughter who is 10 years old because she has PKU and cannot have most candies on the market( no gelatin,no milk,no flour,etc..... .She loves them and eats them everyday.Her sister and me tried them and we think also that they have delicious natural fruits flavors.We don't agree at all with the previous review."
1,Worse candy ever!!,"I ordered this product for my 6 year old grandson so he could have a fun snack for school since he is gluten intolerent. Big mistake, this product is just awful. We thought it might be just Matty being fussy about the taste, but then I tried the product and I'll never do that again. We all agreed, starting with my 2 year old grandaughter, that this candy is the very worse tasting candy any of us have ever had. I'm planning on returning the entire box. Do yourself a big favor and do not buy this product. There were no reviews when I purchased this candy, now I know why."
3,A woman of thirty,I love French literature and Balzac has an extraordinary insight into human nature. I always wanted to read this book however the translation is not the best.
5,Great Book!,Great telling and collection of old Utah mine and gold legends. The author had a very engaging style and walked the walk of and adventurer/prospector. It has pointed me in the direction of new trails and adventure many times. A great source of history behind the legends from a decendant of Pick Murdoch. Tragically George died in a car crash so this is the end of his great writing and work.
5,Yummy!,"MMMMMM....Yum Yum! I love these chocolate mints! Easily my favorite hard candy. They have such a wonderful sweet,rich, chocolaty and even a tad salty taste to them. If you haven't tried these, you are missing out!"
1,Author planting fake reviews all over amazon!,"Don't fall for all the silly fake reviews recomending this book all over Amazon! Certainly planted by the author! This ploy has been tried so many times and it only clogs up the review system with Junk schilling. I hate this practice it ranks up there with Junk Email and telemarketers! I would never buy this book now and it might be good, but the author has lost my trust when he will write fake reviews!"
5,A Fathers Cry,This is a great book that accurately reflects a very common experience in the family court system from an average guys perspective. It is a quick read and kept my interest. Hats off to this guy for having the courage toshare his story.
4,It's about time!!!,"Finally someone is letting the rest of the world know how difficult it is for non-custodial fathers, especially here in Minnesota! Too many times non-custodial fathers are branded with a certain negative stereotype, but NO MORE! Don shows that the system isn't always fair, even though it claims to be!!! Thanks, Don, for telling it like it is!"
4,"good quality prints but thin paper, handle carefully","I printed several pages, The prints had good detail, excellent contrast and color accuracy. However the think paper needed very careful handling to keep it from creasing or wrinkling."
4,Against her will,I enjoyed reading this book very much. I could not put it down. I thought it was very well written.
3,Good read,"I enjoyed the book and it was as good read, but it was hard to over look all of the grammatical errors. Lots and lots of typos!!"
3,Good and riveting story. Poor grammer and proof reading,The story was excellently portrayed. It was very disturbing to think that any person could be so sick and violent. I would not want to be the parent of Kelly Tinyes. I could not get past the poor spelling and poor punctuation. I do not know why this book has not been edited a second time to fix the mistakes. I was so involved in the book that when I came acroos the many many mstakes I almost put the book down and walked away.
5,Against Her Will,"A fascinating tale of murder, neighbor on neighbor, and how it destroyed a community. A sad story."
2,Against her will,"I usually enjoy reading true crime and have read most of Ann Rules books. However although it was easy enough to get into the story I found the prolonged court trial tedius reading. I do admit I like to know what happened finally, but this story never really finished. Sorry, I didn't enjoy this book at all."
3,Average,"This is a tragic story. There is informatin included but much of it is repetitive. The editing was nonexistent, words added, omitted, incorrect, mispelled. It was a book that you had to work at reading. I was also disappointed that the kindle version included no photographs. After reading this book I felt that I needed to go online and research details of the case and look for photographs."
3,Against her will,Fairly good read. Lot of repetition with court stuff. Very bizarre story proving that truth is stranger than fiction .
3,True crime,"It was ok. There was too much detail about DNA and it got really boring , most people don't get into the science of murder."
5,A must read!!,The story is so heart touching and tells the whole story from all sides!! Would recommend this book is something all parents should read!
5,Wow.,"I never buy a CD from just hearing 30-second audio samples, but I made an exception for this one. There is not a single track out of the 21 I heard that I didn't fall in love with. I only purchased this album three days ago, but I've already listened to it six or seven times. I don't remember an album that I've listened to as much as this one on purchase.I was previously under the belief that the Jayhawks made the best alt-country album of all time with ""Tomorrow the Green Grass"". Ryan Adams and 1996-era Whiskeytown has proven me wrong. This album is mucho better than Adams' own ""Gold""."
3,Good Collection of Whiskeytown,"There are some great songs on this CD, but overall, you can't say that it's ""All killer, no filler."" There are actually quite a few filler songs on this CD. If you have ""Stranger's Almanac"", the versions of the songs ""Excuse Me.."", ""16 Days"" and ""Yesterday's News"" are unnecessary. That's not to say that all filler is bad. I have a personal affinity for ""Lo Fi Tennessee Mountain Angel"" - it's got one verse and three chords (like all good songs - three chords, that is), but the message is simple - ""You say you wanna play country but you're in a punk rock band"".""Drank Like A River"" is great, and so are Caitlin Cary's vocals on ""Matrimony"". If you like Whiskeytown, you can't go wrong, though. I like this one a lot more than ""Pneumonia""."
3,Good alternative country,"I will not go on about this album. It's alternative country and that means country with a decent amount of rock. I believe ""Faithless street"" is a good album but no masterpiece. It should be enjoyable to all fans of Ryan Adams and it's very likely that most of those people already own this release. I'll just say that if you're into alternative country and don't know about Whiskeytown, ""Faithless street"" is for definitively for you.For the rest who already have discovered Whiskeytown I bet you're also familiar with Jayhawks (""Tomorrow the green grass"" and ""Hollywood town hall"" are their best) and maybe Scott Miller and the Commonwealth (""Thus always to tyrants"")... But if you're not, prepare yourself for a pleasant musical experience!"
5,A top five record of the 90's,"The songs and performances on this album are so good that it is frightening. Virtually every song is outstanding and there are 7-8 instant classics which could rival anything in the catalogues of Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, George Jones, Gram Parson or any country great you can name. Seriously. To be able to get 21 songs of this quality by one band for the money is almost criminal. These guys leave the other No Depression bands oh-so far behind in their gravel road dust."
5,Why do I keep listening to this disc?,"After seeing this band on t.v., I bought the disc without even knowing who whiskeytown was. soon after, my replacements, clash, and big head todd records were collecting dust. This is the best album that I have in my collection. Many pardons to keith richards, nirvana, dwight, john cash, mike ness, and others. Buy this record. You won't be disappointed."
3,Luv Junkies Rock,"I saw these guys play live in the mid 90's, they were great. Cool guitar work and unique vocals. They have a distinct sound and are hard to compare with another band. Maybe a little like stone temple pilots. Some of the songs are very hard metal and I think this album is 3.5 stars. Its a good cd and for the price its a great buy if you like metal. A few ballads for good measure and hey, they play solos, what a concept, I wonder what happened to them."
3,A Very Interesting Experiment,"I found this book by chance while browsing in a bookshop, and I was very pleased with my selection. I recommend the book for its originality and humour. Self attempts to explore absurb ideas in a realistic manner, which results in some very funny passages. The title story is exceptional, and very memorable.However, while it contains very interesting content, the style is not strikingly original. Furthermore, I cannot advise that the book as a whole is excellent, because although many of the ideas contained within are unusual, I found that I was sometimes raising an eyebrow in confusion, rather than delight.If you are interested in bizarre ideas, I would recommend this book for the main story (ie. ""The Quantity Theory...""), and the opening tale. While the others are interesting, they are not as memorable."
2,The Quantity Theory of Drug Intake,"Sit down and write a clever, although overdone, Twilight Zone-esque short story. Great. Now you have to write a dozen or more short stories to fulfill the contract with your publisher. Oh, the pressure! Just whip out the heavy drugs and let them do the writing for you. This appears to be the strategy that Will Self took in this understandably out of print volume.It is the rare book that I don't finish once I start it. But the stories just kept getting more incoherent, and I had to put it down. The author just got obsessed with the idea that the only difference between the sane and the insane is that insane people do more crazy things than the sane ones do, and couldn't let it go.If you are looking for a quirky collection of modern short stories, go with The Acid House by Irvine Welsh and avoid The Quantity Theory of Insanity for the sake of your own sanity."
3,Not his best.,"It was a quick read. I read it on the airplane and in the airport one weekend. Some interesting items, but not as detailed as his other works. Certainly great as an introductory book, though a bit outdated. I would keep this book in my collection as reference material, but it would be unliekly for me to reread it again. It was not very compelling."
4,Drunvalo is always a treat,"Having read everything Drunvalo has put out I was reluctant to purchase a DVD. I am very glad I did. I was able to personally connect with this message in ways that I had not expected. The transformation that the earth is undergoing is delineated in a sincere and fresh way that would make anyone who is familiar with Drunvalo and his message uplifted in joy and excitement. There was ""new"" information in the DVD that i had not come across before. A great amount of indigenous information and wisdom is shared here as well. The only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the filmaker's artsy attempt to change between color and black and white. It detracted from the message and I thought that something was wrong with the disc. While i do not agree with everything Drunvalo states in this talk, I did learn a great deal."
3,It was just OK,"I was kinda disappointed. I thought it would be more like a movie, but it was like just him talking and it wasn't partiularly that enlighting."
3,"Interesting, but not fully trusting of him.","Drunvalo continues to give interesting information, but how much of it is angelic prophesies. How much of the information is to make money? I really don't know, but I still end up buying his material. Hmmm...."
1,2012: A Moron's Oddysey,"I see that old Stupid is up to his money-making tricks! If you buy this DVD you really are stupider than Drunvalo Malcheesiduck, or whatever his name is now! If you want some spiritual information on earth changes check out the Hopi prophecies that are available on the web--for free! This is just another example of the white man thinking he can own everything. The land, the water, the sky, and now the prophecies of the Indian nations. It's time for this ""Walk-In"" to do everybody a favor and ""Walk-Out"".If you want to do something spiritual with your money don't buy this DVD, but make a contribution to Haiti, or the Miner's families, or to a food pantry."
1,Boring,"Every time there is going to be action in the book, the author inevitably takes you away from it to pursue more anthopological observations.Ex. There's a life or death battle going on in a ship, but we leave that to instead watch someone wander through the wilderness, make some friends, and learn a new language. The battle is only mentioned briefly later and the action well over.This is a common trend. If you like to read about nothing but people and character studies in behavior, you'll love this book. As for excitement. . . you'll want to go elsewhere."
3,Great Book-Where's the melody?,This a great book if your a bass player. The chords are included but I actualy bought the book looking for the melodies so I could play some of these music on keyboard since this has the only version of Vulcan Worlds and some other RTF tunes. I was hoping the the publisher would include the molody as well as the bass part and chords.
5,"California ""Tar Heel"" Longs for N. C. Home","If this book of short stories does not make a former Tar Heel homesick, then I have not a clue as to what would... it made me want to go home immediately. The stories are funny, sad, and range in levels from wonderful to great. A librarian friend gave me this book and it is one of the best gifts I have ever received. I plan to purchase several to give as gifts. My home is now in California, but my heart will always be down home in North Carolina."
4,Pretty but not easy,"I find this an interesting book with some incredible origami pieces, but be careful when buying it, because it is not as easy at it seems. If you are a novice in origami, you'll need patience and orientation from someone who knows more than you. Anyway, there is indeed beautiful origami."
5,Excellent study aid,"This book is a must for anyone getting their IA on their own, or anyone wanting to attain their IA period. Very concise, and full of everything you will need, from the interview with the FSDO, to taking the written."
4,Practical and informative,"This text covers very effectively the many facets of musculoskeletal conditions presented in the primary care setting. The approach follows logically, the etiology and causal factors of each injury / condition. To make each ailment better understood, a blend of xrays, diagrams and assessment techniques are offered. This is important, because symptoms often need to be sorted by M-S, circulatory, and nervous innervation. The text also describes prevention and treatment plans which can be recommended by the primary care provider or other disciplines such as physical therapists. Having been referred to so often, this text has been on my office bookshelf for only 2 weeks and already it is showing signs of ""wear and tear"". It would be an excellent addition to any primary care provider's library."
3,chey_ kimball,Cute girly songs from a pretty teen thathas disappeared from the stage and music scene /
3,Alright,"The world of pop music is full of blonde girls who start out as teenagers. Cheyenne Kimball is no different. She's the new Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy Moore - blonde teenager breaking through with a upbeat pop album.Although her songs are catchy (and she does have a hand in composing the songs) her voice is not upto the mark of the Christina's and Mandy's of the industry. One might argue that Cheyenne is only 16, but i can name other 16 year old singers who have great voices (see Renee Olstead). Besides Christina was only 16 when she started out and she had (and still has) a powerfull voice.Cheyenne doesnt have that power. But she is likable enough and has marketted herself very well. Her audience loves her and for good reason. It's not like Ms Kimball is talentless. She may grow into a great artist. But 'The Day has Come' proves that although Cheyenne has come a long way, she's still got a long way to go."
1,Thought it would be good,"I read about Cheyenne in Girls' Life magazine and thought ""Wow! She sounds like she's a great singer!"" So I borrowed the CD from my cousin. Her voice sounds funny and it sounds like her guitar wasn't tuned. I think, though, that she is a singer who will get better as she gets older."
1,The day has come...Too bad for us.,"Tagged as a singer-songwriter, Cheyenne Kimball sure does disappoint. The ""geniuses"" at MTV make her out to be this deep Tori Amos/Sarah McLachlan type girl, but all we get is a pre-packaged pop star. The lyrics are so juvenile, and they weren't even written solely by her. ""So what if they're juvenile, she's a teenager and her music is marketed towards teenagers."" Well, listen to Fiona Apple's 'Tidal', or Bonnie Mckee's 'Trouble'. Both of those albums were released by talented VOCALISTS in their teens who didn't have a team of songwriters behind them. Don't fall for the Avril Lavigne formula (""she's a songwriter""). And if you saw Cheyenne's performance on TRL or her duet with Sheryl Crow, you know she can't hold a tune. Don't contribute to the dumbing down of society by buying this CD. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away."
2,"Yes, the day has come... now shoot me...","When will MTV learn? and when will anyone ever come to reality? Who in the world told this child that she could sing? She can't! Yes I agree totally with someone on this review the girl is just as nasally as I am when my sinusis are backed up. My cat can sing better then that... Heck why not let me do a reality show you don't have to know how to sing all you need is just a pretty face. And that sums her up in a shampoo bottle. She's young, pretty, petite, and talentless. I say CAN Cheyenne!"
1,The girl...cannot...sing. Period. End of story.,"First of all, I concede that there's something to be said for her as a lyricist. But as a singer, she is horrifyingly, almost comically bad. I saw her on TV and thought she was just ""having a bad day"" (as that other song goes), then heard the CD and realized that even under studio conditions, Ms. Kimball is dreadful: a thin, grating voice and a near-utter inability to stay on-key. (In the back of my mind, I keep thinking I hear Randy shouting, ""Whoooaaa, girl, kinda pitchy there....!"") To think, NBC a few years ago anointed this girl ""America's most talented kid."" Yikes!And this is what we look up to today. How sad."
1,In key please? Can we get her some lessons?,"Firstly this girl is fifteen, so I should be gentle when reviewing her? No. I may have been upset to see Michelle Branch go hillbilly when she was so close to leaving the pop-world for something meaningful, but to see this talentless little thing step up to ascend into her place is annoying.This child cannot sing, period. Her voice is untrained and her natural ability is a karaoke night blitz at best. I've heard chalkboards stay in key more efficiently. If she wants to make pop garbage, throw away, bubblegum music for the forgetting masses, fine. There's a market, exploit it. But where some have talent, some have only looks.This girl is a gorgeous, cute young blond put out there with a guitar to give the guise of a serious musician, but the record company is selling her looks because she has nothing else to sell. One can only hope she'll catch on to being used and either give up or get some vocal lessons and actually learn to sing."
1,It sucks,this album is a load of steaming dog doo. Do not waste your money on it. The songs are cheesy and cheyenne sounds like a cat who has had her tale ran over by a city bus. The Mtv show only played short clips of the songs on the album. They have no melody and the recording sounds like it was made in an outhouse. This girl better get ready to ride the strippers pole as soon as she turns 18 because the singing dont look promising as a career. My dog taking a dump at midnight sounds better than all of the songs on this album.
3,slow delivery,Excellent product but shipping was delayed too long. Did not arrive in time for Thanksgiving for which I planned a dish using these figs
2,It Works but could be a better fit.,"I purchased this for my medium/small lab; who hates getting water in her eyes when out walking in the rain. It is okay, but the fit could be better."
5,Absolutely ideal!,"I tried the regular varietySanta Fe Bean Co., Instant Southwestern Style Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)first. Although I liked it, I was disappointed at how much salt had been added. Usually with fat-free varieties, there is more sodium than the regular equivalent, but in this case, the fat-free is lower in sodium. This turned out to be perfect for my tastes and nutrional needs. I use equal parts of this dried bean mix and water, then I add a little bit of Clint's Salsa (which is relatively low in sodium) and a little bit of shredded cheese. The result is both flavorful and still reasonably healthful."
4,"Good refried beans, but too salty...","I agree with the other reviewers that these refried beans taste good, but I consider the salt content too high - both in terms of taste and health. Whenever I prepare these beans, I add salt-free corn to reduce the sodium content per serving, which helps. If the Santa Fe Bean Company would reduce the sodium content of this product by one-third, I would enthusiastically buy again. As it is, I probably won't, as I am watching my sodium intake."
2,Too Much Salt,"Sorry to say the beans had way too much salt. They also had a burnt taste. Since they are not returnable, I am going to try mixing unsalted can beans with them. I am trying to find beans that taste like Taco Bell beans and these just weren't the ones."
5,Surprisingly tasty!,"My children and I really enjoy the texture and flavor of these beans. Preparation is simple (add to boiling water) and the result is so much better than any of the canned varieties we've tried. Whether used in burritos, on tostadas, or as a side dish, we never have leftovers."
3,Not enough of the Kingdom of Mu,"If you're new to this rather unique movie genre, you'll probably enjoy it. A young Noah Beery Jr. has grown up as a wild boy, a survivor of a shipwreck. The story basically is a Tarzan like one, with lots of stock wild animal footage. The chapter endings are adequate with the ending of Chapter 10 probably being impressive to those who haven't yet watched a number of serials with the same gimmick.However, for the more seasoned serial fan, this is somewhat slow paced and not likely to provide anything spectacular, and this is too bad. The Kingdom of Mu thread could have been developed further and added much more interest, but as it is, you're not introduced to the Kingdom until the end of the afore-mentioned Chapter 10. The theme is introduced in the first chapter when you learn that the heroine is the long-lost and unknowing princess of Mu, but it takes an unfortunately long time to get there, and the visit is too short."
5,Great ballet documentary,"This is a great documentary. After I watched the ""Etoile"" a sort of documentary about Paris Opera Ballet dancers, I was more interested in dancers in addition to the ballet performance. Having said that, Paris Opera Ballet really needs to release the Raymonda ballet performance DVD to show the great work by those dancers. There are some clips here and there but not enough. It is said ""Raymonda"" is one of the most difficult ballet to dance, and it looks like Nureyev made it more difficult but I would like to watch his entire version by the Paris Opera Ballet. They are the only who is keeping Nureyev versions of ballets as repertory."
1,This documentary is vocal review only,"I hoped there would be at least some examples of scenes from the Ballet Raymonda as interpreted by Rudolf Nureyev. Unfortunately, I have seen other of his choreography and do so admire it it but this offered nothing. I looked without success for the actual dvd of Raymonda as choreographed by Nureyev for the Paris OPera Ballet with no luck. I finally wrote to a friend in Europe begging her to help with a purchase there! However if YOU can find THE ballet itself by Rudlf Nureyev's"" Raymonda""( Minkus, I wil gladly buy it!! Good luck to both of us and may I send the documentary""Dancer's Dream"" back to you? Thank you for asking for my comment. Your patron, Nancy FitzGerald"
1,Not the ballet!,"I bought this DVD because I have seen ""Raymonda"" and wanted to relive the experience. This NOT a presentation of the ballet. It is a series of interviews with people associated with the ballet (including Nureyev), but those interviews are all in French. You can turn on the subtitles, but they tend to go by quickly, so that's difficult to follow.Here's the funny thing - sometimes the person on-camera is speaking English, but there's an announcer translating their words to French. The subtitles are cearly retranslations back to English, because they rarely quote the original interviewee's words.If you only have passing interest in the performance, and if you want to practice hearing French, this DVD is for you. But from what I know, that's a small audience."
1,dancer's dream,"This is not what it seems to be. Mostly snippets of ballets and lots and lots of talk, unforutnately in French. A complete waste of money and time."
3,There are not that many photos,"What attracted me to the book was the promise of photos. So I was disappointed when I found there were not that many photos.The book itself has a good history of the conflict. Where controversial exists like what really happened at the retreat at Korsun the writer simply bypasses it with some general remarks. If you were looking for a book to start you off, this one would be a good one to start off with."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed. The seller described the item as in ""very good"" condition, with ""clean pages"". However, the book had hand-written text on dozens of pages and over 50 pages were completely missing, torn out."
5,The Unexpected Journey,"After reading Thom Rainer's ""Unexpected Journey"", I felt encouraged. All of the testimonies show that God pursues us wherever we are and He arranges circumstances in such a way that it is obviously not coincidence but His providence at work. He also softens our hearts so that when we do hear the gospel we respond.The testimonies also show that Christians can affect other people's lives by prayer and showing God's love in thoughtful, simple ways such as cooking a meal, being a good neighbor, or just inviting and bringing someone to church.If you have friends or loved ones who seem to be totally closed to God, reading these different testimonies will give you hope."
4,Listening to the stories,"This is an inspiring and informative book that helps show why people of other faiths have turned to Christianity. It is in more narrative form, hearing the stories from the mouths of the people chosen, than it is an academic treatise. And the stories of the journey for Rainer and his wife as they meet the people is intriguing.I came away from the book encouraged to see that Christianity retains its powerful draw, based on such factors as truth and love. This gave me further additional incentive to help my non-Christian friends to learn about Jesus. I recommend it highly."
5,Every True Believer in Jesus Christ should read this book,"This book contains amazing stories of how Jesus drew people to himself...people who were passionate about their false religion and yet God saved them. It is incredible how God uses the unconditional love and prayers of believers in drawing the unsaved. It also made me realize that even those we label ""hard"" or ""unreachable"" are really wondering about life and death and why we are here. And we have the answers in God's Word, the Bible!"
2,The Unexpected Journey,"This was a gift, and the information rated the source very highly. When I got the book it had a lot of green marker underlining and comments in it. I was very disappointed."
4,Great Cardboard Box Replacement,"I used these for storing things that I used to keep in cardboard boxes and they're really well suited for that purpose. They look much better and they're reasonably priced. If you use them with hanging file folders, the lid is a bit of a problem because of the tight fit."
5,Pushing the weight off his chest,"Incredible, incredible, incredible. I bought the mix cd a year ago and it did not take me long to grasp how ""NICE"" Joe Budden is. Now, his release on Def Jam was decent, but it did not do him justice. The mix cds he dropped before his Def Jam release were excellent, but this one is on a higher level. This is a man letting it all go, you can feel the pain, thoughts and truths in every line. I don't break down individual songs, but even if I did I couldn't do it with this mix cd. Why? Because every track is spectacular. If you are looking for radio's top 20 type of rap this is not for you. THIS IS HIP HOP! Very few could relate to it or understand it. I know it is old, but it's never too late to wipe the crust from your third eye. GET THIS CD! The reason I am giving this review now is because I listened to it again for the first time in months and I am more impressed than the first fifty or sixty times I listened to it. Once again, BUY IT! You will not be disappointed."
1,Joe Budden review,I would love to review this cd but unfortunately i have yet to receive it. It's been about a month 1/2 since ordering it. Maybe dude forgot to send it....oh well.
5,MUST BUY,"Great Album, Great Lyrics, Great Time, this album is needed now in a time of modern rap, (now and days its not hip hop, its rap a commidified, not-musically inclined, over produced attempt for greedy music executives and over macho rappers, with no musical talent to make money). Joe Budden is by far one of the best out lyrically & musically, and should continue to be supported because of his brutal honesty, and lack of joined the 99% of rappers out now and days that waste people money putting out horrible mixtapes and albums. They are the reason why East Coast rap fell off because they think consumers could give a F---about street credibility when we really want is real music. This albums is a definite Buy, every track is great and very insightful."
3,The cover does not match the book at all!,"Fifteen year old DJ takes care of her family's farm after her father hurts his leg. She and her father are also not talking to her two oldest football star brothers for reasons not discussed at the beginning of the book. Back up quarterback for the rival team, Brian, unwillingly shows up to help on the farm during the summer and soon DJ becomes his trainer. Her summer changes DJ and her perspective on life.Dairy Queen is a realistic story about a Midwestern farm family who doesn't talk much. The audiobook narrator uses a northern accent (sort of Fargo-ish) which is distracting, but very much in character. A good read, though not spectacular. It does show the characters in a realistic light and I can see that others would like it for that reason."
4,"A Girl, Football, and Cows","This is a story about D.J., a 15-yr.-old girl who helps with the family Dairy Farm in Red Bend, Wisconsin, and has a love for football. She used to play with her two older brothers and gets sucked into helping Brian Nelson, the good-looking quarterback of her school's arch rival team, train over the summer. As she gets to know him, she gets to like him. He is shocked and feels betrayed though when he finds out she will be playing against him! The whole story is told through D.J.'s view.This is a fun read about a girl and her self-esteem issues. I enjoyed learning some about Dairy farming, all the football aspects, and how D.J. learns that communication is so important. There is enough included about her family and friends to make this realistic fiction. I look forward to reading the sequel--this is the first of the series.(Read on Kindle)"
4,Great,This book was so good! It had me laughing and crying. The girl can write a story! I love DJ her character was so true to a high school girl in this situation. I love a good High School book especially with a little Romance. I think this would make such a fun movie. So if anyone has any pull Hollywood's way let them know;}
5,GREAT!!!,"this was a great book! i loved the realisticness of it. unlike so many books that are more focused on things that could never happen to the average person, this book is about a teenage girl living on a dairy farm. i really like it because the main character isn't popular. she seems really real and the way it's written makes you feel like you are there with DJ. i actually got lost in this book and had to take a minute to get back to reality. catherine is a very good author and i would recomend this book for girls especialy between the ages of 12 and 20."
4,Good for teens,"This book made me smile, made me frown, and made me care a little bit about football. Overall tone and voice were fitting for the audience and the main character is very likeable."
4,Dairy Queen,"Can I say interesting? Well, I just did. This book wasn't like a lot of the other books I read... it was interesting and unpredictable, and it wasn't so much about D.J. playing football as it was about how she grew up in one summer. Football brought the plot along, yeah, but it was still only a half-plot. I still liked the book a lot, though, because it was sweet in a way, and the characters were unique and different.Not sure if it was the best book in the world, but it was great in it's own way, especially for a debut novel."
4,great read!,"I really enjoyed Dairy Queen. It did drag a bit, perhaps, in the first half, but I stayed up late to finish it. Much more compelling and enjoyable than other YA's I've read lately. D.J.'s voice is what makes this story come alive."
2,This book bored me,"I know some like reading about the farm life, but I didn't. I found it a bore. The book is 274 pages and seems to DRAG on. Like you keep thinking ""is this book ever going to end"". And I definetly don't think that with all books- I've read books with 400 pages and up (and liked them). Anyway, It takes FOREVER to finally get to the main plot of the story.This book can be funny, ""ha ha"" funny not ""laugh till you cry"" funny, but I still didn't think it was worth it.Two stars.EDIT:the other reviews-The reviews seem to be coming more from adults who are taking a deeper look at the writing. I don't know any teenage girl who would read this book and say ""what nice character development it has"".We want action. Adventure. SOMETHING.Ugh, I remember I could read this book to put me to sleep at night. Development shvelopment. Hurry up and get to the dang story, Murdock!!"
2,Read it before your daughter does,"It's been a while since I read this, but my reaction to it is still strong: I put it away until my daughter hits high school (say, like a junior or senior). It is not high on the morality scale, and young teenage girls are just too impressionable. It has good bones, with an interesting plot, but with too much yuck thrown in. The football element makes it a fun read, but it is a romance, not a sports-related book."
2,Should've left this book on the shelf...,"I bought this book about 6 months ago and finally have enough time to read it now. I should've kept the book on the shelf. The stories fell flat. The 2nd part of the book wasn't as bad as the 1st though. I just couldn't get into Hilde's character. She was so annoying! One sentence she says she loves her husband Sigurd, the next sentence she says she hates him. This went on from the beginning of the story all the way to the 2nd to last chapter! I really wanted to like this book because I love historical romances, but just couldn't get past the main characters' behavior. Take my advise and save your money, because you're not missing anything worth reading."
5,Great book for kids!,"My son loves frogs and this book was one he checked out from his school library. He loved it so much that he wanted one of his own, so I ordered this one. He really enjoys it. It's very informative and entertaining."
1,NOT MARSHALLTOWN,Description claims this is a MARSHALLTOWN trowel it is not. It's made in China and it shows in the quality.
2,Excellent Optics but cheaply made :(,I used these for birding and really loved them but the eye cups are made of plastic internally and breaks super easy. To bad because the view is great.
5,Great lesson book,"I'm taking a conversational Spanish class, and I think this is a great textbook to learn the basics. Lots of straight-forward practice exercises."
3,this book should have been titled ' le virago Imogen'!!!',"This is my first medieval by this author and third book by her. I gave it 3 stars for the setting and for the fact the author generally avoided annoying plot contrivances i.e those situations authors tend to 'create'seemingly out of nowhere to force confrontations between the characters. I truly wanted to give this book 2 1/2 stars because the whole narrative was from ONE character's point of view!!!There were other characters who contributed to a somewhat strong plot - Warbick, Lancaster, Renard and of course the dark champion himself, Tyron but we are treated ONLY to the female character's thoughts, actions, regrets, motivations etcetc. It greatly bored me towards the end and I thought the plot lines of the story would have been served better if the author had balanced both protagonist's and antagonist's point of view, not just one person hence my new title!"
1,Disappointing,"I found this novel not up to Jo Beverley usual standard. The heroin was whiney and annoying, the hero plain weak. I suggest you not waste your money on this one!"
4,Great Valentine Gift,"I sent this to my girl friend since she has a Schnauzer back in her home town, it is so adorable and she totally loves it :)"
4,Very Cute,This schnauzer is so cute. I ordered it to send to my husband in Afghanistan to remind him of our schnauzer at home. He loved it and slept with it every night. (Our mininature at home sleeps in our bed.) When he came home for R&R he left it here and after all the traveling and packing it is still in excellent condition. Even if you don't have a schnauzer at home you won't be disappointed.
3,Stuffed Animal,"I was looking for stuffed animals that were stuffed with micro beads. The description indicated that they were. However, they are stuffed with other stuffing as well as micro beads. Disappointed that they were not what the description indicated.With that said, I was still happy with it."
4,informative middle school text,"This textbook describes New Hampshire during the colonial period, and is divided into chapters about the region's aborigines, early settlement, conflicts, the revolutionary war and statehood. Many line drawings, photographs, maps, sidebars, biographical sketches and facsimiles of historical documents are included, and the material is dense while still geared toward the interests of its target audience, such as what food was eaten, what kids' lives were like, etc.I learned quite a bit while reading this, and will use this as a reference for regional information. The cover and binding are sturdy."
4,.,"After the disappointing and self-important 2nd half of Church & State, Jaka's Story is like a refreshing breeze in the Cerebus storyline. The incorporation of significant chunks of plain text first makes its appearance here; but at least it is, content-wise, addressing things relevant to the Cerebus storyline (as opposed to say, Reads.) I enjoy Sim's art more than his writing, but the balance here is fairly nice, and most importantly, it is a *focused* & coherent volume of the work. It's tonality is more serious than that of earlier Cerebus volumes, and this is a bit awkward at some points, but overall Sim pulls it off reasonably well. The slow pacing helps generate the appropriate atmosphere and immerses us in this particular leg of the story -- allows us to really settle in. Not my favorite Cerebus book, but a pretty good one. Pud was a particularly interesting character."
5,Alex Sydorenko,"Jaka's Story is a favorite of mine in the Cerebus Series. Its almost as good as Volume two (High Society). The artwork is stunning. The story is superb. Jaka, the dancer...alterego of Cerebus the barbarian...What a match, huh?--Alex Sydorenko, Oct 1999, Chicago"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A wandering Cerebus runs into Jaka for a while, who is working in a tavern. He ends up staying with her, and her husband Rick for a while. Jaka's backstory is divulged via an Oscar Wilde type parody."
1,Not really what I was expecting,"The BDU hat was made of a sort of cheaper fabric, a little strange looking."
5,Techniques of Scenario Planning,"I have been looking for a book that will actually help me with my business planning and at last I have found it. While at times it can be very technical, this book is a must for any one who is serious about business."
3,Not For Everyone,"I am generally a fan of alternative products, but this is outside-the-box toothpaste that will not necessarily suit everyone.The fibers in this paste are thin and flexible. They do not dissolve as you brush, and a few of them may work their way in between your teeth. Therefore, it is important to floss afterward to remove any rogue fibers.I am good about flossing, so this is not a problem for me, but I suppose in a corner of my mind I am a little paranoid about whether any small fibers have been left behind.On a positive note, I love cinnamon. I am rotating this product with some other toothpaste, so it will get used up. However, I will have to think about whether to get another tube.If you are up for something a little different, this toothpaste is worth trying at least once."
3,Don't understand what's so great about this product,That pretty much sums it up right there. It doesn't taste as good as Tom's of Maine which is what I am also using (minus the fluoride). And I am starting to feel like that part about regular toothpastes being too rough and scrubbing through the white layer of your teeth until it yellows them from the yellow layers underneath was just a clever sales pitch they used on their website that I fell for. It's an average toothpaste and hasn't offered me any benefits so far over Tom's of Maine. Including the SLS issue.
5,Great for Stunting,"This book is great! It shows in detail on stunting and pyramids. I'm a new coach for an all star team and I've been hunting for a book like this. It also has great ideas for cheers, training tips,and sample forms. I wish it would have went into more detail on tumbling but overall a must have for any cheerleader or coach!"
5,Atomic Train changed my life!,"My dad once told me, ""son, a movie isn't a movie if someone doesn't get injured and/or killed by an owl."" Last month I realized how incredibly true that is. I also realized my dad never said that.The film industry was done a freaking favor when director (genius) David jackson took over the reigns on this thoroughbread of a movie. Certain words come to mind after watching a film of this calliber. Most of these words I cannot type, for children may view this, but here are a few: ""what?"" ""huh?"" and ""why!?""After watching Atomic Train my best friend jumped out of the window of our hotel after saying only, ""I have seen all there is to see!"" He was right. Not a day goes by that I kick myself for not jumping out of that window as well.But in all seriousness that owl was David Bowie from The Labirynth right?"
1,wow,"Watching this movie, was like....well, it was like watching a train wreck. I couldnt stop watching it despite how painfully bad the whole movie was. You can read some of the other reviews for some of the endless flaws in the plot line. Anyways, my point is this: don't buy this movie. You'll just end up wasting two hours of your life."
1,worst movie ever,"this movie is one of the stupidest, most pointless movies ever created. the special effects rank up there with that of 1970's british TV. the acting is severly lacking, and is not even fit for a high school play. plot is meaningless and nonsensical. the only way you can possibly watch this sad work of ""cinema,"" if you can call it that, is by shutting off one's brain, sensory organs, and all major nerves. this film is maybe worthy of a mystery science theater 3000 spoof, if that. if you like to waste money, be my guest, and buy this horrid movie."
1,compasses don't really work,"the items arrived on time and fast. ordered 4 of them, and they all point in different directions within about a 60 degree swath. whitles work well... nice item concept, should sell attachment modules separately... and use compasses that actually work within 60% of accuracy!"
5,"SPLENDED, MAGNIFICENT, GLORIOUS!!!","It is a great production. Artistically convincing if not enthralling. Technically a little bit, I would say, too panoramic when it comes to the way the sound is recorded. The singing in the German version is outstanding, you just understand every single word, for instance in ""Why do the nations so furiously rage together"" one has no problem in following Theo Adam. The singing techniques used by all the singers in this recording match so well the spiritual genre of oratorio. Although I highly praise a couple of other recordings of Messiah in the original language, I find this one greatly balanced, especially when it comes to the tempos. I think this particular Messiah deserves a better remastering; it sounds a little bit too digital. Berlin Classics has so far issued a great many wonderful recordings which are quite successfully remastered, but not this one. Despite this little flaw don't tarry to purchase it, you will be deeply moved!"
5,Great to use on intake manifolds and parts in contact with gasoline,"This is great stuff to use on intake manifolds, it's pretty much the only product you can use on to seal gaskets that are in contact with gasoline. As a warning, it did not work well sealing up my nylon intake manifold, but it really wasn't made for that either. If you've got an aluminum/aluminum or steel/steel mounting surface on your engine (be it auto, aviation, or motorcycle) you'd do well to use this product to help the gasket seal up the interface. Another note, this stuff is hard to remove, but if it wasn't it wouldn't work well."
5,A slamming Motzart beat the best beat of 2003,"Animal Rap is Animal Rap and the beat is one of the best ever it is nothing but Motzart but only a better beat then Nas doing as good on the rap part Nas just ripped it they just did okay but the Beat is enough for 5 stars a nice tune listen up.Lyrics 7/10 Production 10/10 Overall 8.5/10Also recomended-JMT-Violent by Design and Nas-""I Can"""
4,Lessons with Lendon,The book is well written so the average person who is either starting out or is early in a riding carrer will benefit. I particularly liked the fact that she believes all basic dressage will help in what ever riding carrer you may wish to take. She spells out the riders total responsiblity verses the horse which I found to be very refreshing. I gave it 4 stars only because it was pitched below where I thought the book was based on the reviews.
5,Great,This book is well worth buying. The author writes in a very easy to follow manner and it is full of exercises that really work for horses and riders. She gives plenty of examples and the photos are wonderful. I would buy anything that she writes.
2,Re-publication of Articles from Practical Horseman Magazine,"I'm sure I overlooked the disclaimer, but it appears this book is a compilation of the series of ""Practical Horseman"" magazine articles that Ms. Gray authored several years back. Still good information, of course, but I wouldn't have purchased that book had I known that. (I saved the magazine articles to a binder, you see.)"
2,next time get the schlage,"Trying to save money wasn't worth it. The only benefit of buying the Dexter instead of Schlage is that they can share the same key. Otherwise...the lockset itself is very lightweight, the holes for the deadbolt AND the regular cylinder both require a larger drill-out than Schlage (so you cannot pre-drill all of your locks). All in all, I would not buy this product again - I would spend the extra money and buy Schlage or, if buying new for my whole house, consider Kwikset with titanium deadbolts."
4,Nice looking locks and knobs,"Great looking looking locks, easy to install. Keys are a little hard to insert, but maybe that will get better with use..."
5,HEROES AND VILLAINS,"I bought this book because of the caricatures by Gerald Scarfe, which are wonderful. However, I found that I really enjoyed the text of the book as well, for it gives two perspectives on each of the famous persons caricatured, which gives one a fuller portrait. It is rare to read anything but praise about such people as Virginia Woolf, Churchill, and especially Princess Diana, and the brief essays from both positive and negative viewpoints really do help one to see different aspects of these admired people. In my opinion, it is a very informative and thoroughly enjoyable book."
1,Again...smelly,The scent made me almost sick to my stomach...I can't use it anymore. Kind of a musty spice scent...not what you want your face to smell like. like a bad mens cologne.
1,bad news,"The web page indicated that it was an adult chair and we received a child's chair. Neither Amazon nor the vendor wanted to take responsibility of the mistake. Instead of returning as I would not get the correct product by Xmas I decided to assemble and give to the kids. Piece of junk with mismatched holes, poor quality control and finishes on the product. Vendor representative admitted they are just middleman and do not control the products they sell. The vendor did give me the opportunity to return chairs but as they are already assembled and glued per instructions I am not sure how it will be boxed. Am hesitant to buy from them again and will dissuade as many as I can from buying from them. The hassle is not worth it. Displeased with Amazon response to same. Thinking twice about Internet Xmas shopping. Some works and some does not. Only buy from reputable who stand behind their products."
5,An excellent independent flick...,"Hmm... that review above sounds like it might just be from a jealous independent filmmaker? We can all guess who, I'm sure! The Vicious Sweet is an excellent independent movie - perfect in every way. It's truly one of the best indies in a long time. If you like your horror intelligent, then check this movie out! A++++"
1,What Was I Thinking?,"For sure, this tool did not work for me! Each time I have tried to use it, I ended up soaked to the skin. Did it move leaves down the gutter? No! Perhaps, someone will show me how to operate it before I pitch it into the trash."
1,Not What expected,Wanted mainly for use on sidewalks and driveway. No instructions came with product.Not as much pressure as desired and not really know if using effectively withoutany instructions.
1,stay away very cheap,"to save my self a fall off a ladder, I orderd this wand knowing it prob. Wouldn't work. It did not dissapoint. All I wanted out of this thing was to blast out the downspout of one particular hard to reach gutter. Waste of money. Might be good to clean your dogs underneath!"
2,It did not work at all for me.,"The main reason I bought this was to blast debris out of my gutters, mostly leaves. I think I could get more pressure by covering the nozzle of the hose with my thumb. Pretty disappointed. It's a good idea for a product, but doesn't work at all for me. Maybe mine is defective or something."
2,not practical,"I haven't used this product yet since it needs to be connected to a hose (warmer weather); however, it took me over an hour to extend it with the twisting feature. It does not twist easily and extending it by this method took a long time and it was collapsed very tightly"
2,The idea is good,"The idea is great. Being able to push the leaves down the down spout without getting on ladder. The problem is we got completely wet. We still needed to get up on the ladder to get everything. Still had to pull out leaves from the downspout, the water from the wand would not wash them down and seemed to make them more stuck than helping."
4,Great tool!!,This is an excellent tool for cleaning your gutters. I have a lot of trees in my yard and our rain gutters fill up every year with leaves etc. This tool makes it much safer to clean those gutters. The extension works well and makes it possible to reach those higher places. I have noticed that if you hit the spray nozzle slightly to the side it does loosen and sprays water. Overall a good tool
2,marginal quality,Used this for a couple of seasons and it worked fine; blew out lots of leaves and gunk. However it has come apart in the middle and is unrepairable. It should have lasted longer. I guess the price is right.
2,Spray Head Falls Off Too Easily,"This tool looks well constructed of aluminum and brass and the spray is powerful, but the spray head fell off in the gutter after 15 minutes of use. It washed into my downspout and got stuck there. And you can't buy just a replacement spray head.I wrote to the Orbit company and they sent me a whole new unit (nice guys.) Then after 15 minutes of use, the spray head fell of the new unit again! It's made to easily screw on and off, but that means you have to constantly tighten it and make sure it's not about to get loose. I've given up using the spray head. Instead I just use the wand and the U-shaped pipe, which by themselves are fairly useful. The wand has a solid on/off switch for the water and the water comes out powerfully (probably varies with your household water pressure.) But I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Not Powerful Enough Plus Mechanical Problem,"I bought this product in the hope that I could just blast out all the dead and decomposing leaves in my gutters. But I found that the stream of water it generates isn't powerful enough to do the job by itself. I wound up picking the gunk out of the gutters by hand (one-story home, thank goodness) and then using the Orbit to wash the remaining debris out. As other reviewers have noted, you do get quite a shower using this wand, so be sure to wear rain gear or old clothes! I also had a mechanical problem with this product: the part that is supposed to telescope is stubbornly stuck in its original position. I was afraid to try to force it to telescope, for fear of breaking the unit. So I was unable to extend the length of the wand."
2,Does not work well,"This wand would not clean up my gutters, I end up just standing there getting wet. Might be good if you have a single story house, but whats the point in having it extend, if it doesnt work that high."
2,"Works, but leaf blower attachments work much better.","This item will clean your gutters, but using water is a very messy way to clean gutters. I would rather get on a ladder than to get wet from wet leaves and overspray. I took this back. Gutter cleaning attachments that hook to your leaf blower work, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better. Dry leaves blow out much, much better than wet ones and you don't get wet in the process."
3,Good but not as easy as it looks,"My gutter is a little higher up than most, so I duct taped an additional pole to it so it would reach. This worked OK. You WILL get wet so do it on a warm day and dress accordingly. Also, a couple of times the U head came unscrewed and flew off just from the water pressure. I can see it happening and the head landing on the roof and I would be out of luck because I hate ladder (the reason I got it). After about 2 hours, I got my gutter cleaned out enough so that that the next big rain, I saw it running out of the spouts like never before."
1,Wheres my CD??????????,"I bought this CD on 3/1/09 it is 4/3/09 & I still dont have the cd, WTF? Why does t take so long? I bought the cd at a great price BUT the price dont mean SH#T if i dont get the cd for over a month... Thats bad bussiness. As a matter of fact wheres my CD>>>> Im writing this review & I dont even have the CD."
4,"A UNIQUE, TALENTED YOUNG ARTIST",I love this CD. It's one of my favorites. He's great at expressing his mind. It will be great to hear something from him again and soon.
4,ON LIVE THE 90's,This is back when music was music!! 90's music is superior to anything being made today. Music today is made for the club and there are no groups now. This cd reminds me of when I was a freshman in highshool. Ahh memories...
1,Remake!!!!,"Although this is probably the original singer , this is not the original recording from the 70's Beware!!!"
5,The emporer has no clothes,"If implemented, the ideas in this book could radically reduce problems in churches such as deception, molestation of children by clergy, unhealthy sectarian barriers, unhealthy dependence on leaders to think for others, unhealthy loading of responsibilities on pastors that should be distributed to ordinary believers.If you are looking for a book that just bashes ""spiritual abuse"" or the traditional institutional church, this book is not for you.If you want to get a balanced view of what biblical leadership should be, this book is excellent food for thought..."
4,What I once thought was Biblical,"It may be quite a startle for many believers to realize that most of our church authority structures are closer akin to corporate America than anything that can be found from the New Testament. Such is one of the themes found in ""Who is Your Covering?"". The author takes dead aim at the many unscriptural patterns of authority rampant in modern Christendom and contrasts them to the life and simplicity of the Biblical record. He breathes fresh life into the many passages that have commonly been used to support unbiblical leadership models. This book has done serious damage to my 20th century evangelical mindset. All my arguments for supporting what I once thought was Biblical have been completely deflated. Instead, I now have a new appreciation for how this issue of ""covering"" directly effects the visible, practical headship of Christ in His church."
1,poor quality,"I was very disappointed with the quality. The worst quality of goods I have ever purchase. basically, it makes images very unclear. It sat at my home now."
4,"nice, but a bit thin",Arrived quickly. Looks good. The only thing that I didn't like was that it seemed kinda thin. I'm sort of worried how it will do in the washer and dryer since its already on the thin side. But overall its okay.
3,Astronauts Wife,"I couldn't put it down when reading this book i thought it was great,only to get to the end was i disapointed. The ending was to far out there from the plot of the story. I would recommend The Astronauts Wife if you are into fiction. I haven't had the chance to see the movie, but i'm not in a real rush after this book."
3,Imagine being afraid of the one you love.,I would rate this book a 7.I liked this book because it kept me in suspence and I didn't want to put the book down until I found out what happened next.The only thing that I didn't liked was the ending because it didn't end up the way I would of expected it to.It also gets you thinking if in fact this situation can happen in real life.
3,"Was I ""spaced out"" along with our Astronauts?","I thought the movie was great until the last fifteen minutes or so. Now, I usually don't have trouble following a plot... but (without giving the ending away to anyone else) could someone try explaining to me what exactly DID happen after she plugged in the radio? And afterwards... with the... you know... ""kids"", what was that all about? I was left with more questions than answers and may read the book if only to understand what it was that happened... it's as if I got ""lost"" for 2 minutes or so at a crucial part in the movie that left me void of understanding the final outcome. It reminded me of ""Rosemary's Baby"" but That was an ending I not only understood, but left me feeling haunted for a long time."
3,I only read the book for Clea DuVall,"My very, very favorite actress of all time has to be Clea DuVall. She's smart, beautiful, and extremely talented, and I'm only going to see the movie to see her. To be honest, I basically only skimmed the book to see how big of a part Clea had (she plays Nan, Charlize Theron's little sister) and --yay!-- she has a pretty big part. If you want a preview of what the movie will be like, read the book, otherwise, it's not too great. I think the guy basically put the screenplay into bigger words and paragraphs, but the movie seems like it'll be good."
4,"A good read, but...","...then again, it is a bit spare. Maybe because it is a novelization? The plot was well explained even though there was a bit of a problem telling the tale. Most definitely will be compared to ""Rosemary's Baby"" for a long time to come.Fine of its type, but still, not a materpiece in any way."
1,Comic books have more depth!,This book was the October selection for our book club. It was so bad that we had to cancel the meeting. The only thing to discuss might be all the typos throughout the book. Do not waste your time or money on this one!
2,Pretty Generic,"If you like rock or indie rock and are a little nerdy, obsessive and opinionated about your music... you probably won't like this pretentious, generic attempt at rock."
2,YEAH RIGHT!!!,"THIS IS NOT LESBIAN MUSIC, BUT A CORPORATE MEDIA MAN'S VERSION OF WHAT LESBIAN MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT!!! THEY ARE TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT HERE. I SEE NO REASON TO BUY THIS CD UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE DOMINANCE OF MALE OPPRESSION OVER TOP OF US!!! STOP THE MADNESS, WHERE IS MEG CHRISTIAN AND JOAN ARMATRADING!!! BRING BACK THE REAL LESBIAN MUSIC!! KEEP OUR MUSIC 100% LESBIAN!!"
4,I Passed With A 69,"I have taken three Clep Exams within the last 45 days. This exam was not as easy Intro To Sociology and not as difficult as Principals of Management. I used REA prep materials successfully with those exams as well. I read the book, took two practice exams, and took the Clep exam. I passed with a 69. Everything you need to pass the exam is in this book and I recommend it. Good Luck!"
2,Careful with REA,"This book does not cover all that you need to know for the CLEP exam, therefore be very careful if relying only on this book. Also, the actual exam has 100 questions to be answered in 90 minutes and this is very short time for the number of questions and multiple choice answers offered. Also, do not rely on practice exams from this book, since many questions on the exam weren't covered neither in the book nor in the prep tests."
4,not so good curler,"I am changing my review of this product from 4 to 2 stars. After I submitted my first review, this product fell apart. I have only had it for about 6 months and had to toss it."
2,Shocking,"This book is utterly outdated. Please see Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday and other more recent scholarly work.My rating of two stars is to give credit for a tremendous amount of work and consideration for the timeframe in which it was written, but this book should not stand alone as a history of the Long March at this time."
1,Misleading the Reader,"Mr. Salisbury makes it quite clear where his sympathies lie in the Chinese Civil War. I find it disturbing that he expresses his political leaning in print, where he has a reputation of impartiality.This book ignores the ugly realities that was the Long March in favor of perpetuating the myth that was one of the cornerstones of Communist China. There are other fact-based accounts of the Long March out there that will point out that--whatever your political leanings--the Long March was deadly (most of the Communist soldiers who started the March perished), the retreating Communist Army savagely oppressed the inhabitants of every region they passed through and occupied (a taste of things to come, sadly), and Mao used the March to brutally consolidate his hold over the Communist party."
2,Lacks originality,Part of what I loved about the Everwood soundtrack was it had lots of songs that usually didn't air on the radio stations; the disk primarily contains remakes of songs I've heard for thirty years. I'll probably go back and try to find each of the less familiar songs individually.
2,"Buy the originals, skip these poor imitations","For those of you too young to know the original verions of these songs, this cd might sound really good to you. Because these are some excellent songs. But the covers are just pale imitations of the originals.The Cat Stevens covers are especially poor. There's a reason that many of these artists are largely unknown if their original pieces sound anything like these.There are a few bright spots on the cd. Jason Mraz does a good cover of Summer Breeze. The *original* theme song is included here, which I always liked much more than the overly orchestrated one it was changed to later on in the series. The Treat Williams song is fine, as is the song by Jump Little Children (which is an original). But these aren't enough to make the album worthwhile. I recommend skipping this cd and checking out the artists who made these songs popular in the first place."
3,Hobby Knife Set,This is a great little set. Only problem is it doesn't come in any kind of a storage case. You have to keep it in the plastic packaging it comes in. I would have paid more to have a storage container of some kind with it.
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST BLUES CDS OF ALL TIME,"THIS CD HAS IT ALL GREAT BACKUP SINGERS,HORNS,SCORCHING GUITAR AND VOCALS.ALSO A RUNNING TIME WELL OVER AN HOUR.TRACK #5 ,A SONG TO HIS MENTORS WITH A SAM COOKE HINT OF ""YOU THRILL ME"" IS 8 MINUTES LONG AND WILL KNOCK YOUR SOXES OFF....GET IT....THE NEWMAN"
3,Mixed Bag,There are some fine cuts on this album but it is slightly uneven and has some filler. I would have loved some more guitar playing instead of backup singers and horns.
4,letter from israel,"In order to fulfill her obligation to her race, the Jewish people, this young, American, grade school teacher migrated to Israel. No one who contemplates such a pilgramage could fail to benefit from the information here presented. It is a five year diary; a tale of joy and turmoil but mostly one of fulfillment, not a coming of age but becoming one essential unit in the building and defense of a nation. If you consider immigration this book may disuade you but it will strengthen the resolve of others. If you survive, and you may not, the Israel experience will weld you to your race and instill in you an abiding self-possession"
5,It's back,"Finally back in print, as it deserves to be. I see it's getting some more reviews because of this, too. I read one of them below and was a bit horrified to learn that Morrell gave away the ending in the introduction. Well, I already know the ending, which is a thousand times better than the movie, and can only recommend that all fans of action and adventure and fast-paced fiction grab this book off the shelves. At least you won't have to see Stallone's face on the cover, peering at you with those half-dead eyes of his. Speaking of Stallone, why didn't he, after starring in his only real non-Rocky hit movie, scoop up every Morrell book out there and see if he could go back to the well again? I know I would have. Morrell is now more into the international intrigue thing, but First Blood and a few of his other early books are straight hard action, and the best ones he wrote. First Blood, of course, is the best. Read it."
4,"Not as good as the moive, but interesting","I actually enjoyed the First Blood movie better than the book. The book is better in some parts though. This book explains a little bit more about the experience that Rambo has in Vietnam. I didn't like the ending in the book, not that it ended the way it did, but I think the author strung it out too long.The book came first though and I think that should be respected as the blueprint."
5,Nothing would be better than this book.. movies.. nothing!,First Blood is better than the all 4 movies. Its characters can shock you(such as trautman being dark and not really knowing rambo) . The book is a very good read and if this was to be turned into a remake based on the book better like they did for forrest gump the movie would be remembered
4,Excellent. Loved the movie but this is different. And just as good.,"Somebody suggested this book to me and at first I wasn't interested. I was a fan of the movie and didn't need to reread it. When they told me the book was different, they weren't lying. Wow. It's not different as far as general plot (Rambo escapes from jail after being harassed by the sheriff). But its different as far as events and character details. I love that there are no clear villains or heroes in this book. Teasle and Rambo are both flawed. They are both right and both wrong. If you love the movie, you must read this. I'm glad the movie ended up the way it did. But this is a nice alternate Rambo story.BY THE WAY!!!!!!! Do not read the introduction of the novel. I was more than upset to find out that the ending is unveiled in the introduction. A much needed ""SPOILER ALERT!"" should have been noted."
3,First Blood,It is an older book and in fair shape for the rating. The story went one and one and did not have a jelling point - except for the first part and the last parts (these were small parts).
4,"Good, similar, but different enough from the movie","I imagine most people by now would have first watched the movie, so a comparison is necessary. The book was good. It went into more character depth than the movie could. The story is basically the same, but has substantial differences in character and plot to make it a worthwhile read.I liked the slight differences of the screenplay over the book. Stallone's version made Rambo more of a cornered victim with no other options, thus the underdog story classic in Stallone's movies. In the movie, Stallone plays more of the victim of a bully, and by the end of the movie, the audience hopes for the destruction Rambo creates.In the book, both characters are 50/50 victim and protagonist which makes for a different and equally interesting story. The book comes together well in the end with a very different ending and understanding of both characters. I liked the book and it is worth reading."
2,DO NOT READ THE INTRO FIRST,"DO NOT read the introduction of this book before you read the rest. I spent over a year searching used bookstores for a copy of this book, so I was thrilled when I found the new release. Then, in the introduction, the author gave away the ending. I couldn't believe it. I can't believe he would do that. I can't believe the publisher would let him. I'll never buy another David Morrell book, ever."
2,"Not what I expected, but very okay, Not as good as the film.","This is very much like Jaws. That book was also made famous by a brilliant classic film. So this has alot to live up to.sadly its not Stallone, it long winded and boring in places. Still worth reading, but probably better if you had not seen the brillaint films first.This is just an average book."
1,Cartoonish and wooden characters with an unrealistic plot,"I read this book 20 years after seeing the movie and couldn't believe how bad the writing and plot are laid out. The characters are wooden and flat and the plot is plodding and slow. There is very little connection between ""point of view"" jumps and the ""action"" is laughable. We don't really understand Rambo's motivation to destroy the town or make stand, but it really does not matter to this story.I'm career military and sent this book to a friend in a combat zone. All of his buddies read the book and laughed at its buffonery. I'd reccommend you see the movie and skip the book."
1,Rambo: First Bleh,"Reading this book reminded me that even terrible authors could make a lot of money. I got used to Hollywood dishing out [crud], but books, I thought were always reserved for the truly talented. I was wrong. David Morell's [book] is an uninspiring, terribly written book that any fourth grade English teacher would have failed. You can't identify with the characters and the entire novel lacks any type of description or analysis to seperate it from the worst of action movies. Just because this a book involving action, doesn't mean it can do without intelligent writing. Pick up Ian Fleming's Bond series or read one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures, but for any Rambo action: rent the movie, it's a lot better."
1,"a ""kid"" who wonders through the forrest with broken ribs.",I saw the movie. But the book is totally ridiculous! Read about what it's like try to conduct living while having 2 or 3 broken ribs.80% of what Rambo does after the first 20% of the book is centered and focused on his aching rib cage.I couldn't BELIEVE how stupid this writer is.the MOST boring book ever! the dumbest sentences EVER put into a book that truned into a good movie.westjp@n2.com
5,One of the Best,"This is the birth of John Rambo. The real Rambo lies in wait within these pages. A guy you can sympathize with. Thrilling story. Natural and believable characterization. Just an excellent read. Not very long. Does not drag at all. And the ending is poignant, bringing the stark reality of the Vietnam War's effect on America into highlight. This is one of those books in which the author ""leaves out all the boring parts"" as Elmore Leonard once said about how he managed to write so well. I recommend this novel heartily. You cannot be disappointed with this read. :) As a wise, pretty Asian girl once said: ""You not expendable, Rambo."""
4,Man Hunt for Rambo,"John Rambo is a drifter, looking rugged and rough, who comes across the likes of Police Chief Teasle. Both men are war veterans and soon a massive struggle breaks out between them, and the excitement takes off full blast. David Morrell has written an unforgetable action classic. It's not only the action which keeps this novel pumping non-stop, it's also the drama, tension, combined with understandable psychological undertones. The characters are rich and invlving, as is the plot and overall pace of this fine tale. Also, Colonel Trautman is not the expected character portrayed in the motion picture version of this novel. In fact, so many things are left out, which makes the novel a splendid read, even if you've seen the movie beforehand - as I have. Different and interesting ending too. Well worth your time!"
5,Awesome,This book is better than the movie and the movie was very good. At this price the book is steal
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A seriously good combat veteran is drifting, no longer in the military. He wanders in to a town, mostly minding his own business.The local law enforcement decide they don't like the look of him and his alpha maleness in their 'nice' little place.They harrass him.Very, very bad mistake.In the end, to salvage the situation, Rambo's old relationships must be brought to the surface."
2,Rambo rides motorcycle naked?!,"I thought the movie was better. In the book, Rambo can't seem to do anything without a gun. In the movie, you see Rambo as a trained and controlled worrier who can kill with anything he can find in nature. The movie also does a much better job explaining why Rambo flips out and runs for the woods. In the book, when Rambo escapes, he's completely naked. He remains naked until he happens across someone brewing moonshine in the woods. If you found a naked man running through the woods with a gun and straight razor, would you give him clothes? No wonder it took so long for this book to become a movie, they had to rewrite the [stuff] out of it to make it good."
1,NOT A GOOD ONE,I didn't like this one at all. The Blue Note sound quality magnifys the innocuity of Bill Hardman's trumpet playing and Curtis Porter almost makes J.R Monterose sound good. It would have taken a McLean or Jenkins to salvage this one.
4,First gave it to my wife while working on my doctorate in 1970.,"First gave it to my wife while working on my doctorate in 1970. Have never see it locally. Both she and I love the fragrance. The ad said Prince Machibelli (Spelling?), but it arrived in a Bonnie Bell box. After 38 years do we remember if it smells the same? Nope! But she smells as great as she looks, and for an octogenarian, she is a knockout!Grant"
2,disappointed,I expected this to be more musky and to last longer. It's very weak and it only lasts a few hours.
4,highly recommended,"i have been a micheal bloomfield admirer for many years. ""live at the old waldorf"" has some great moments. check out his comping on ""farther on up the road"", and his electric slide playing on ""the sky is crying"". it sounds as though he is playing a electric trash can!! it is sad that micheal bloomfields legacy is largly ignored these days.highly recommendedi also recommend >1. micheal bloomfield: don't say that i ain't your man!:essential blues 1964-1969"
1,Big disappointment,"First, let me say I am a huge Bloomfield fan; I think he was one of the best electric blues guitarists ever. His ""Don't Say that I Ain't Your Man"" is an absolute classic, desert-island choice, and a great over-view of his playing. I have also played guitar for close to 40 years. I regret saying that I find this record absolutely unlistenable. I thought I must have missed something, so I went back and listened carefully. Same conclusion. I think someone had these tapes from a bad night during not a great period for him and decided to make some money. I have no doubt that if Mike had lived, and someone had come to him years later with these tapes, he would have buried them."
1,big disappointment,"the title of the album is a misnomer..if you will take a careful listen to the album ,you will notice that Mike is not singing,and his usual tasty guitar licks are absent.in addition to that you will be surprised for the very poor recording of the album,,considering it is a legacy/sony release.the only good thing about this release is the packaging with pictures and liner notes,,nothing more ,nothing less. buy at your own risk."
3,"Bloomfield one of the greatest, but not presented here.",First I need to start off with I feel Michael Bloomfield is one of the greatest blues guitar players of all time. Without a doubt his precision and dedication to playing the blues is unsurpassed. But that being said I cannot say I enjoyed the majority of this CD. His slide guitar playing was at times very sloppy and disorganized. As soon as Michael would put down the slide his true brilliance would resurface instantly. The problem is he was playing slide on a good chunk of this recording.
2,"One good song, the rest so-so","Michael Bloomfield was a notoriously spotty performer. I saw him on number of occasions. Fortunately, I saw some great performances. After 1973, he was a hit or miss player for me. This collection goes south quickly after the opening cut, ""Sweet Little Angel"" and even having said that, one has to wade through Roger ""Jelly Roll"" Troy's overblown vocals to enjoy Michael's great playing. Troy was never my favorite. I have given this two stars because I am a huge Bloomfield fan but I can't recommend this CD. You are better off with Bloomfield's ""Don't Say I Ain't Your Man"" or even better with Nick Gravenites' ""My Labors & More""."
5,Great hair products,"I always get these to use in my hair. They are good at not ripping out my hair when I take them out, but hold the hair firmly in place. I have very soft, fine hair so I need a way to hold the hair in place. I especially like thes clear one, because they don't show in my hair or clash with my outfits."
2,ok hair elastics,"These were simply ""ok"". I probably will not repurchase again. They are no better than drug store grade silicone bands."
5,An excellent book in every way,"Marking the Hours is a superior book. And those who've seen my other reviews, including of Duffy's Stripping the Altars, know I can be hard to please.Are you interested in church history or in illuminated manuscripts? Then this is a must buy. In fact, I lugged this book (It's not small!) with me to Oxford for my studies, and it came in very handy for a tutorial essay and more.Do you just like medieval art? Marking the Hours is very well illustrated. Just looking at the pictures and reading the captions is a pleasurable education.Duffy does take sides on some questions concerning English church history. (He is a devoted Catholic.) But he's fair and not overbearing in this book at least.I can't praise the book enough. If this area interests you in the least, Marking the Hours is well worth buying."
1,Bruce Fresh Finish 32 oz bottle,"The product itself is easy to use and provides a clear and even finish.My problem is that I ordered the product through Amazon on June 18, 2012 and as of July 20, 2012, it has not arrived. On July 2, 2012, I purchased the product locally, cleaned the floor and updated the finish. Covered a 12 x 16 room with two coats in a reasonably short time."
3,Not thrilled....made for a taller seat.,"There is nothing really wrong with this table, except it can be tippy due to the one longer leg needs to remain directly under the table, specially with a laptop on it. We have another laptop table of a different design and it is much more secure. One other mention, this table remains high, even at its lowest setting...would be more suited for a stool rather then an office chair or couch. The 2 level table is a very handy feature.I have replaced this table with another of the different more secure base design...."
1,Already in my basement.,"Too unstable to work on it...seems weak.simply didn't like it, wasn't made for me."
3,It's OK,"I found thing product to be a little overrated. I didn't receive the first one they shipped, they did ship a second one out to me. When I realized I didn't like the product and asked to return it, they told me I would be responsible for shipping since they sent it twice! Hello I only got it once! Anyway the box was extremely heavy so I figured it would cost an arm and a leg it ship, so I decided to keep it. It's just OK, nothing special, kind of quality you'd expect from Target. It's too tall at the lowest adjustment, and it gets very unsturdy when you make it taller. In MY opinion it cost too much. I would pay around $25 for this not $65!"
1,"Such sweet, subtle lyrics",Remember the good old days when no self respecting rap fan would buy an album with whack rhymes?
3,ying yang twins album USA,"There album as a great beat for each of there songs my favorite song is bad which features mike jones,collipark,and the ying yang twins.In my opinion the album is off the chain they have lots of diffrent artist so if you do not have the album I suggest that you go buy as soon as possible.So if you like rap and the artist that I mentioned you should go buy there brand new album."
1,How the h*ll can this have 5 stars?,"WTF is this? Ying yang twins. Saw their new single and I think that they are onto something with this ""Wait"" song. Now only if ALL THEIR TRACKS were at this volume or lower then they would get the IDEA that no one (at least no one with a true sense and appreciation for real rap/hip hop) would want from these two pickaninny, minstrel show clowns. They, as well as lil jon and most of the southern crunk crap on Tv these days are taking black people a step backwards instead of forwards which we should always be looking at. It pains me to see anybody take this kind of music for anything of worth because it represents nothing and they make themselves look very ignorant in the process. Don't support these fools and if you see this CD in the record store, LET IT ROT ON THE SHELVES SO THAT THESE TWO WILL SUFFER A LOSS AND UNDERSTAND(IF THEY ARE THAT SMART AT ALL) THAT NO ONE WANTS THEIR MUSIC."
2,I am begging you...,"Please do not buy this album, if you are new to rap...I do not see why anyone with any knowledge of Hip Hop as a whole would even consider purchasing it. It was hardly worth my time, and I downloaded it. If you are new to rap, a nice place to start out would be 2Pac's greatest hit's, or if you want something a little more lyrical I suggest "" Liquid Swords "", or "" Grandmasters "" Maybe even "" Revolutionary VOL. 1 by immortal tecnique.But if you just love your su=outhern rap, there is still a laundry list of CD's to pick up before this Make sure and check out "" Get Ya mind correct "" Which is probably one of the most slept on Dirty South Classic's. Word Of Mouf is excellent too.If you are so desperate to get a yin yang twin's album though, don't get this crap. Get me & My Brother ( which is much better than this ) And also check out some of there compilation's with one of the best producer's from the south Lil Jon, and what's happenin with Trick Daddy is a great song."
1,What?,"How can people call this music all it is is people screaming yeah, okay, and what. That's just dumb. The stupid sex class skits are really dumb and useless. This album looks good but don't be fooled this is not music so buy something else."
1,stop hating on the ying yang twins,"I havent heard the album USA but there is one thing about the ying yang twins i think everyone should hear. in the june (i think) issue of VIBE magazine, there was an article about these rappers and it told me something that made me have much more respect for them. they both have birth defects. the taller bald one d-roc has a premature hand so the fingers on one of his hands are short and stubby. the other one kaine has cerebral palsy so one of his legs drags behind him awkwardly. before i read this article, i thought the same thing many people think about the ying yang twins: they are idiots that only know how to rap about sex. but now i realize that they only rap about all that stuff to hide their disabilities. they are actually very intelligent people. i just thought i would tell everybody that so they can have a new view on the ying yang twins."
5,Good Album,"During my first listen, I gathered that the Ying Yang Twins wanted to make this more of an experimental album. It's very different from Me and My Brother. They're experiementing much like Outkast did in 2003 with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. It delights me to see hip-hop artists trying to change and reinvent themselves. You should definatley pick up this album. Highlights include Wait and Ghetto Classics."
2,Total disappointment! Too soft.,"Where's the power of crunk gone? Are these guys fighting with Usher for the title, who'll be the biggest R&B stars of Atlanta or something? Total disappointment... Next time these guys gotta bring that lost image back. Compared to Me & My Brother or Lil Jon & The ESB's Crunk Juice this album is something like terrible nightmare with no way to wake up."
1,Another example of why African Americans are given a bad name. . . . . .,"This ISN'T Joseph. I am one of his daughters.Have you ever listened to any of their CD's? All they do is talk about stupid stuff and sex and it makes me sick!!!!!! The only good song is ""Wait (the whisper song)"" And it shows women as h*es (I just like the beat)!!!!! The Ying Yang twins are nothing but the most ingorant people in the music industry and it makes me sick that guys are following their example! Not all women are h*es and have no respect for themselves! But the Ying Yang Twins certainly think so! I wonder where they would be if they weren't allowed to rap about sex and drugs and other ridiculous stuff and say the word ""haaaaaaahh"". That's right . . . they would suck!!!!!If you are a girl . . . or a boy that wants to RESPECT women . . . DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
1,Just by a single of theirs....,"Because all of their songs pretty much sound exactly the same, their style is so played out and watered down, it takes a real simpleton to purchase something so crappy. It blows my mind that 2 guys as untalented as they are sell so many records. As I do with all my reviews, I recommend a cd or too that's actually pleasant to listen to, now for all you simple-minded ""get crunk"" rap fans, check out Little Brother- The Minstrel Show (they're from NC so you're not breaking any crunk laws) and Scarface- The Diary. You've all been Zapped."
1,Not Funny,"I'm a long time fan of the Twins because their crunk music is just so stupid I can't help but laugh, but this CD is loaded with boring tracks that even Lil Jon himself couldn't get crunk to."
2,Average at best,"I like some of the Ying Yang Twins,but there is a Energy&Edge missing on this Set. they seem to be going for a Polished vibe,which is taken the edge away from what they do best&that is making tight cuts or funny skits.alot of skipable tracks here."
3,Nothing Special... but it'll do,This album is pretty hot and cold. Some songs are really good while others just plain suck.F*** the Ying Yang Twins- 4.5/5Long Time- 2/5Live Again-4.5/5Ghetto Classics- 3.5/523hr. Lockdown- 4/5Wait- 5/5Pull My Hair-2.5/5Bedroom Boom- 2/5The Walk- 5/5Hoes- 4/4Badd- 5/5Put That Thang Down- 4.5/5Shake - 4/5My Brothers Keeper- 2/5
4,good cd from ying yang twins,"suprisingly good. it's nuthin like me and my brother. it's way better. best songs are live again f/adam levine of maroon 5, the walk,hoes,badd f/mike jones,put that thang down,my brothers keeper,and wait remix f/lil scrappy,free,busta rhymes,and missy elliot."
4,havent listened to it all but so far pretty good,"this is a pretty good album. i just got it so i havet listened to it all but what ive listened to so far is really goodsome of my favorites1. Badd Featuring Mike Jones2. Wait (The Whisper Song) Remix Featuring Lil' Scrappy, Free, Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, and Mr. Collipark3. Wait (The Whisper Song)4. U.S.A.5. Long Time Featuring Anthony Hamilton"
2,NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!,"What happened to these guys? ""Me and my brother"" was explosive, but this one was a dud. It's an R&B instead of a ATL cd. #1-#10 sucks. The rest hypes you up a lil bit, but just a lil bit. That's all I can say abotut his cd, because it SUCKS."
1,Ying Yang is the perfect name for such an imperfect duo,"I wanna whisper a little something to all ya'll,(THIS ALBUM STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN ALONG WITH SLIMM SCRUB AND DEBBIE(AKA WEBBIE). They got the right name because every thing that comes out of their mouth is a bunch of Ying Yang. By them knowing that they talk a bunch of ying yang, they must know that they're weak. With all of my reviews toward Dirty south rappers, you might notice that they all sound the same because their music is all the same.PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND THEY'RE LISTENING TO GARBAGE.THE ALBUM TILTLE USA SHOULD STAND FOR UNDER SATURATED A*SES BECAUSE THEIR MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE S*IT."
4,Ying Yang deliver another winner,"The Ying Yang Twins deliver another winner with their USA CD. The CD has six hilarous skits and 17 bangin tracks for with that down south flavor. Standout tracks include the slow jam crunkness of Bedroom Boom with Avant and Pull My Hair, the booty shaking anthems Badd feat. Mike Jones & Mr. Collipark and Shake with Pittbull. All in all this is a hot CD and there's no complaints from me."
1,They 've done it again,"So of the 22 tracks almost half are skits. What is the deal with skits. Almost every rapper has atleast one track that is just a retarded recording of them being drunk, high or just acting dumb. Do the people who buy this record realize the are paying $13.00 or more on 10 tracks of music (i am using music losely) Who thinks these skits are even entertaining, I know I don't. Yet again the YYT have concocted another perverted cd thats only purpose makes for good club beats but as usual the lyrics suck. Not suprising."
5,Heah! U.S.A. Ying Yang Forever,This CD is crazy as hell my most favorite song in the whole CD is Ghetto Classics it's the bomb. Ying Yang Twins is the best out the ATL. 23 Hr. Lockdown is definitely the something that u can listen to. It's dedicated to Pimp C (Free Pimp C). Everybody get this CD.
5,Hot Hot Hot!!!!!!,"This CD is tight, a lot of great songs. Their single Wait is hot..if you like it, you might want to get the remix of it with Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, Free from 106 & Park, and Lil Scrappy."
1,S.O.F.T.,"I guess the Ying Yang Twins done gone soft. This c.d. is weak. Where are the the old cats who pumped out azz shakin beats, gansta', durty south cuts that even they, themselves described as music for the strip club....this...this ain't nothing but ""trying to get radio play"", sold-out bull.I mean...I loves me some Anthony Hamilton...but Anthony Hamilton on a Ying Yang cut?!?!?...come on fellas...And the rest of the c.d. is this pop radio, r&b...;""what I like in my man"" talk....corny!!!And the cat from MAROON 5?!?!?....oh, no....how white suburbs is that?!?!?Hope to see the old YYT back again soon..."
1,This is truly truly bad.,"I don't listen to commercial radio - it would make my ears bleed. But once in a while, I'll check out what all the hype is about in regards to some of the names I keep reading and hearing about - it's almost impossible to avoid pop culture, unless you're out in the woods somewhere.I listened to a few samples of the Y-Y Twins. This is hot??!! It makes my ears bleed. Awful, awful droning low-IQ sounding voice, boring beats, stupid lyrics and the worst offense of all: Not sexy, not clever. Memo to all these guys, white or black or brown: Listen to Marvin Gaye, Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, Prince. That's sexy, clever stuff. Is everyone checking their brains at the door when they buy records? Many kids growing up have almost no clue what good music is. I'm a big hip-hop fan and can think of many great hip-hop artists/bands and tracks, but this is some of the worst I've heard so far. Ouch ouch ouch. My ears are still hurting..."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"Definitely something different from the twins on this release, they still keep their crunk style that brought them to where they are but you can notice alot of maturity in most of their lyrics, and songs like ""My Brothers Keeper"" really stand out on this one and bringing in the soulful voice of Anthony Hamilton on ""Long Time"" also shows that sort of transition into a more as we say that grown man music. But still dont let that shy you away from getting this if you're more of the crunk style fan because they havent let their loyals down, and ""Put That Thang Down"" is a sure club hit for the summer, and ""Pull My Hair"" which comes off as another ""Wait"" is definitely that x-rated style that they do well with also. Overall this is a very good album from Ying Yang with a few curve balls thrown in along with keeping it true to their begininngs this is a great album for any Ying Yang fan who has been with them from day one or to be introduced to their unique style. Definitely worth picking up."
5,Absolute Truth,"First of all if you are a fan of crunk music (which i am) you will love U.S.A. Ying Yang did a good job on the tracks. I remember when i got Amerie's album and all of her songs sounded the same. I was real dissapointed. But anyway this cd is great and if your not a fan of the music theres something on here that you will like. I like the colaborations: Anthony Hamilton, Adam Levine from Maroon5, and Pitbull! Cop that U.S.A...."
5,Good enough to be in our disaster preparedness auto kit,"Hoo-Ahhs are an excellent product - good enough for us to include them in our disaster preparedness auto kit (see my blog if interested). The towels are sturdy, don't have a flowery smell, and re-seal in the package. Hoo-Ahhs fits the niche market of those willing to pay a few dollars more for a quality product. My only suggestion to the company is to offer a larger package as well. These packages only have 20 towels.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Process of Elimination"" - an intense thriller that pits a martial artist against a world-class sniper out to shape the presidential election."
1,BUY AND BE HUSTLED!!!!!,"I'm a huge Lebron James fan and I just purchased this DVD thinking that it would be a classic highlight reel of his plays and dunks. Instead all I received was the first 12 minutes of an actual ""60 Minutes"" show featuring Lebron. The picture on the DVD case looks like someone printed it off of their printer. The actual footage was good but it was just a small portion of a pre-recorded show. I feel hustled because I paid 15.99 just to watch 12 minutes of ""60 Minutes"". I could've recorded this on my DVR machine and saved me the money. Whoever is selling this DVD ought to be ashamed of themselves. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD or you'll pay the price just like I did."
5,Will Primrose Woodmouse find her way out of Chestnut Wood?,"First published in 1980, Autumn Story follows Lord Woodmouse's daughter through her adventures exploring the delights of autumn harvest in the woods, until she realizes she is lost. As always, remarkable illustrations of blackberry brambles and fauna seen only by tiny folk bring both authenticity and charm."
5,You can do it yourself!,"I'm really enamored of Nolo Press's self-help legal guides. This one saved me $400 in legal fees. Just follow the steps outlined and it will guide you safely through even a court hearing, if you want to be able to change your passport. If, in the process, you decide you want to change any deeds your old name appears on, you can use their quite inexpensive guide to updating Deeds in California. As for typing up the forms -- neat printing does the job, too."
3,Good!,"Good but not great. The book follows all the story of tango but there is something missing....many of the pictures are unfortunately 2-paged and cannot be appreciated (plus I couldnt find any passion in any but 2 of them) although the book seems to getting better as you go towards the end. The edition is of course luxury but i can't say i was amazed. Anyhow a good choice for an absolute beginner to tango but I would suggest Horacio's Salas ""the tango"" in every case."
1,Very Dissapointing Drill,"I own a number of cordless drills ranging from Porter-Cale to no-name, low-end throw aways. I bought this drill 6 weeks ago for light duty use in my wood shop. With poor run times and a chuck that doesn't hold, I called Makita to complain. They told me it was a good drill but that you get what you pay for and I shouldn't expect much from this product. Quite frankly, neither this drill nor their service meet basic levels and I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,Good drill-bad chuck,"I have owned several Makita products and have been a satisfied customer over many years.This was a replacement for the older version of the same drill, but unlike the older Makita cordless this one fails to retain a grip on the bit after even a small amount of use. This is true whether it is being used to drill holes or as a screwdriver. In the mode of unscrewing it is completely hopeless. Given this info I would definitely not buy this product again.This is not to say that Makita makes bad products, but that there is a serious flaw in this model."
2,Disappointing Quality,"When my thirteen-year-old Makita cordless drill packed it in, I bought model 6280 DWRE as a replacement. I was shocked when I opened the box up to see its apparent cheap quality. I thought Makita meant top quality. Not so. Next time I'll definitely comparison shop before buying."
2,Read the fine print !,"Some of the product descriptions on Makita products are in error. This drill is listed having 2.0Ah batteries. The drill ships with 1.3Ah batteries. I recieved a replacement today with the 1.3Ah batteries again.This drill is fine for occasional users, but for a little more you can get the Makita 6337DWDE 14.4 volt with Ni-MH batteries. Note the the header on this product is wrong because it says the batteries are Ni-Cad.Makita assured me that the product will come with the Ni-MH batteries."
5,"A great Album. (Patty Smyth, What a BABE)","I bought this album to get a song called ""Beat Of A Heart"". I love this song. When the music video came out for this song I use to leave my TV on the MTV channel just to catch it. Patty's such a babe. I also like other songs such as ""The Warrior, Goodbye to you, etc."". The song ""Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough"" is a beautiful song."
4,blast from the past.,heard goodbye to you and remembered how much I used to like patty smyth. I was happy to see her greatest hits was available.
2,Patty Smyth,I found the CD to be disappointing due to the fact that there was only one song I really liked on it. I was expecting more and did not get what I hoped for. I would not recommend the CD further....
5,This collection is a breath of fresh air!,"With all the nonsense we see in music stores from new women artists...Patty Smyth's Greates Hits collection reminds us that women vocalists once knew how to make good music. Hard hitting and infectious tunes make up this great collection. For an eighties rock fan like myself, this album is a must for my collection. Songs like The Warrior and Heartache All Around the World are as good as rock tunes get. Lets hope Patty releases a new album.....before we all drown in a sea of self proclaimed divas."
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I got this cd for one song and one song only, Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough, a great song, and what I thought would be the only good song on the cd. Not really knowing who Patty was, I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasntly surprised. Besides Sometimes Love.... there is the Warrior, The River Cried, Goodbye to You, plus many more. The only downside, is Downtown Train, yes to song that Rod Stewart did, His version was great, this one bites. But over all, this is a good disk, with good song writting, and Patty as a good voice."
4,Very Good,"I have been a fan of Patty for many years, and I've always felt that she's a huge talent with mostly mediocre material. This CD is the perfect one to own for Patty fans, as it features all of her very best work plus that of Scandal."
1,Not what I ordered!,I ordered a cook book for the product the MAGIC BULLET. Was in disbelief there could be two titles for a cook book called Magic Bullet but even more in disbelief when it wasn't for the product Magic Bullet. It's one of those instances when the picture/description could have been a little clearer so I could see that it was not to go with my Magic Bullet grinder.
1,ripped off,"because this cookbook was suggested as a purchase with the Magic Bullet blender I purchased, I mistakenly assumed it was recipes I could use with that purchase. I believe I was purposely mislead. Live and learn, I guess. I will certainly review any purchases in the future."
1,MISREPRESENTED BOOK TITLE,"""""THE MAGIC BULLET COOKBOOK""""THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A COOK BOOK OR RECIPES USING THE MAGIC BULLET EQUIPMENT...THESE WERE JUST RECIPES THAT CAN BE FOUND IN REGULAR COOK BOOKS. I AM DISAPPOINTED !! WANTED RECIPES USING THE MAGIC BULLET.... THE BOOK NAME WAS MISLEADING.IN THE FUTURE, I WILL CAREFULLY READ COMPLETE ARTICLE AND NOT RELY ON BOOK NAME ALONE.The Magic Bullet Cookbook"
3,Not for the Magic Bullet appliance.,Wow shame on me this was purchased for the Magic Bullet appliance. This has nothing to do with the Magic Bullet. We kept it to try some of the healthy recipes. Haven't tried yet. Only for health food people.
1,Very unhappy,I expected a cookbook that would be using the bullet and found instead a book that occasionally used a blender.Having it called Magic Bullet Cookbook is a grossly misleading title.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when this arrived to find that it was just a normal recipe book, not one with recipes to use the Magic Bullet."
1,GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT DUE TO IMPROPER WORDING (SEE BELOW),"This book ""The Magic Bullet Cookbook"" was shown as ""something other people purchased/or looked at"" (I can't remember the exact wording) when I purchased the ""Magic Bullet"" kitchen small appliance that my Granddaughter wanted for her Christmas present. I thought it would be really nice to include this ""special cookbook"" to go with her new ""Magic Bullet"". Imagine my shock when I received it and opened it up and discovered it had absolutely nothing to do with the ""Magic Bullet"" I purchased for my Granddaughter. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I DONATED IT TO A CHARITY."
2,Cookbook doesnt go with Magic Bullet blender....,"I sent this cookbook to my sister along with the Magic Bullet Blender""I chose this one because it was advertised alongside the blender on the web site so I thought this must be the right one....Well it wasn't. My sister says it's kind of an odd cookbook with all sorts of exotic foods and things that you don't normally buy or see in the grocery store. Oh well, my mistake. It has the same name as the blender so it's easy to make the mistake."
2,Ok I guess...,"I got it because I though it was the Michael Thurmond's Magic Bullet cook book but it is not. I found this out right after I bought it but could not cancel my order. So I got the book an did not want to pay to ship it back. I read some of the recipes (I collect cook books). Some of them aren't too bad, except for the idea I cannot eat most raw fruits or veggies. But there are plenty I can still use. My ma-in-law was reading it the other day too."
5,Dark and quirky fairytales for adults!,"Ever since I read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty novels, I have craved more adult fairytales. And it can't get better than this! Each story in Snow White, Blood Red -- the first part of the Snow White series -- has a dark and gothic undertone in it. And I marvel at the fact that the elements taken from Snow White are twisted and disarming -- thus, making this one of the most literary anthologies ever written. My favorite story is Patricia McKillip's ""The Snow Queen"" -- the brand of magical realism in the story is exquisite. Snow White, Blood Red is an excellent reading investment and I look forward to reading the other installments from this unique series."
3,Edgy!,"As I've come to expect when reading anthologies, not every story in this volume of adult fairy tales is to my liking.However, all in all the book has a sharp feel to it, with so many stories that have great potential and quite a few that I loved just as they are. I especially liked:THE PRINCESS IN THE TOWER: amusing and light; andA SOUND, LIKE ANGELS SINGING: read it to see what it's all about--if I were to tell you, I'd spoil the storyEven if this collection of fairy tales retold isn't the best on the market, it's still great fun! Read it if you are a fan of dark fairy tales."
1,You Will See Red if You Waste Your Money on This,"Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door also edited by Ellen Datlow and Fractured Fairy tales by A.J. Jacobs as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books. The fairy tale is over success was not achieved here."
5,Fairy tales go a little wrong in _Snow White_.,"The first time I read this book, I was quite taken aback by the eroticism that threads thru nearly every story. I later returned to it, prepared, and discovered the treasure between the covers. The adaptions of the fairy tales give you real, flesh and blood characters, surprising twists, and a thoroughly satisfying read!"
2,the authors try way too hard to be edgy,"When I first started reading this book, I thought the premise of giving new twists to old fairy tale was such an awesome idea. But the more I read, the more the stories felt contrived. It was if the authors were trying to come up with something really edgy and hip, and they didn't quite make it. After you read a few stories, you begin to see that all of the authors use sex and violence as a way of ""re-telling"" the tale. Consequently, all of the stories begin to feel the same. The book is supposed to be new and innovative, but after a few stories it just the same old thing over and over again. I suggest you skip this book."
2,"""adult"" disappointment","I totally agree with Illana's review of this book:we, readers, don't get a deeper retelling of these traditional tales, but a veneer of sex and violence that gives them an ""adult"" appearance. While I found the sex and violence were totally superficial and unnecessary, and they didn't manage to move my profounder feelings, I felt deceived in my intention of going deeply into these beloved stories. I think that good fantasy writers often succeed in a deeper view on folk tales without announcing their intentions to the readers, but subtly letting them find similitudes in theme and characterization. Maybe this is because good fantasy writers let themselves be carried away by the powerful archetypal potential latent in everybody's mind and explored since the dawn of time through folk tales."
3,Belinda - Runaway Horses,An excellent compilation undone by poor video and audio quality. I feel that record companies should take note of Belinda's popular numbers and must have a greatest hits compilations of her music videos on 2 DVDs as she was one of the finest artists featuring in her music videos.
5,belinda is the best!!!!,well i love this video with all the best videos of belinda carlisle she's the best i love her since she was in the gogo's she is just great everybody enjoy this video
2,Delta soap dish,"I finally put this soap dish on my wall. It's OK, but it doesn't mount flush to the wall and the dish is plastic. It's definitely not worth the price."
5,inspiration for artists,"I read this book in the 1960's. Now 40 years later I wanted to read again what inspired me then. It's rare for any writing about making art is meaningful, but this book is an exception."
3,Skims The Surface Nicely,"This book has some nice vintage advertsing art in it, but I must say the text is pretty light-duty and seems to be aimed at young readers. There are also several typos and some wrong information. The book definitely has merit, but there are books that cover aspects of the same subject with much greater depth, like Thomas Hine's ""Populuxe"", Lesley Jackson's ""Contemporary"", Michelle Gringeri-Brown's ""Atomic Ranch"" and, for the serious historian, David Halberstam's definitive tome ""The Fifties."" But as an introduction to the 1950's lifestyle for someone new to the subject, this book works just fine."
2,not as expected,"This book was part an Amazon buy together with Armstrong's Inspiring 1950's Interiors (which is what I was initially interested in purchasing); I expected something along the same lines. There aren't even any actual photographs. They're all drawings. The book is basically a story about what people did in the 1950's. If that's what you're looking for, then this would be up your alley. I was looking for more design inspiration. I wish that I would have purchased Armstrong's Inspiring 1960's Interiors instead."
1,Looks great.,Plugged in a bluray player and turned it on. The pro 900 locked up and sounded an alarm. Owners manual stated that the protection circuit had sacrificed itself to save my bluray. Send unit in for repair. Never got to see it power anything up. Bluray works fine.
1,Monster pro 900,"Bought this May 01, 2012. As of this review 12/25/12 the power switch just failed. Looks replaceable. Hope Monster makes good on their product."
1,power switch broke on the second day,"Power switch broke on the second day, need I say more. Horrible build quality, don't waste your time on this product."
3,Works But Questionable Quality Control,"PowerCenter PRO 900 was doing just fine for about two months. Electrically, it still works as expected, although I've done nothing to challenge its features. The one problem I just encountered now is not being able to turn it off by its switch. It just stays in the ""on"" position. Not too much of a problem since I expect to be running it in an always on mode."
3,"Works, but power button stuck","The unit works, but power switch stays in the on position like the other reviewer stated. I have to plug it into the wall to turn it on. Could be big deal for some."
4,"on switch, is fully operating!!","greetings people, ive seen this product around for a while, wasnt sure to try it, since every single review on monster page says that the on switch broke up just in the minute you start to work with it, so ive decided to give it a try, since this is cheaper than the pro power 2500, which means clean power stage two...ive got to tell you people this was fully functionall, up today(its been about 4 months since ive bought it),i bought it to get rid off some noise ive been experience on my monitors, since at home i dont have any fancy pretty designed by electrical conections, just the regular ones(at this point i got to mention you im from ecuador!!, and house electric sistems sucks here!) im using the power pro 900 it with my entire racks, and the problem of the dirty noise signal ive experience on my monitors simply dissapear ! like magic!! haha seems to be that ""clean power stage 1"" was enough to solve this!! im getting another one! to use it with my guitar racks!"
4,Tornado!,"This tornado flick is head over heels better than the theatrical release Twister. As a real weather weanie with a PhD in climatology, I can say without a doubt that the portrayal of meteorologists and storm chasers is a lot closer to the truth than the stereotypes presented in Twister. The portrayal of the weather service, weather maps, and the tornado itself was also MUCH better than in Twister. If you want a tornado adventure movie which is a lot more accurate than most of the junk out there, get this movie.One can make the claim that the plot is rather predictable, weather boy meets powersuit girl, they fight, but then get to like each other, but so what, a lot of movies use a similar plot. The characters are likable and its a fun ride. Bruce Campbel gets to give a performance which is not over the top, and proves he can be a serious actor, given the right material.This is my favorite tornado movie. Its a nice little movie, the good guys persevere, and the weather stuff is good."
3,Interesting alternative to Twister,"This TV movie was obviously a direct ripoff of Twister and aired on the Fox network mere days before Twister came to theaters. However, it was mildly entertaining, considering the tornadoes didn't make many appearances. Bruce Campbell and Ernie Hudson were decent in their roles. Personally, I would've preferred to have Campbell in Bill Paxton's role in Twister. Special effects (what you see of them) are okay."
5,Great movie,okay so this movie isn't like Twister but it is a good movie. Good plot and I was happy to find it online for less than $20! Never heard of the movie but started watching it on Netflix and then they removed it so I had to buy it!
2,HOT AIR,"Amazing how Noel Hesseck's direction could make a tornado seem so insignificant. With little special effects of any note, this Twister wannabe suffers from flat, laconic performances, most notably Bruce Campbell and Ernie Hudson. Even L.Q. Jones seems winded and lifeless. An obvious made for TV soapie, that never shows the tornado at its worst.Rent don't buy."
3,Wow..lol,Azien...where in the world did you see an F100? That meso must have been at least twenty miles wide...hehe=)<>A<>
5,best light brown sugar I've ever tasted,This sugar blows regular light brown sugar (made by mixing molasses and white sugar) right out of the water. Great in baking but even better on oatmeal and such.
5,Must-have,"I cannot believe I was ever able to travel with a toddler before ordering the Ride-On Carry-On. Essential, especially if you are travelling without another adult. The biggest hassel you will have is being stopped to be asked where you purchased it."
4,Really Great if you travel often,"I got this as a gift right before the first airplane trip with our son. It worked great. It gave us a way to handle him as we went through the airport. It also gave him a place to sit his own size while we waited. He was happy as a clam. The only unfortunate thing is... we have not flown since. So, it has only been used one time."
5,Great!,Recently travel overseas with my 4 years old son...we had to change planes in Germany and this chair was the best thing to have.I had travel before with strollers and it was a crazy drama at the gate...one time they gave me the stroller at destination which didn't help when i had to change planes and terminals... another time they put my stroller as luggage and i had to get out trough pass control to retrieve my stroller... almost lost a flight...This thing you can even put it in the carry on if you don't use it....One thing I have to say...you have to have a good carry on most important the wheels of it have to be good...I maneuver it with one hand forward and backwards...My son was watching a movie on his portable DVD player...was very easy...I recommend this product for people that travel with kids .
3,"Good value, looks great, but high maintenance","I bought three Decolav 1300-P for my bathrooms, and they look awesome with polished stainless faucets. They are fairly easy to install, as they are very light.The downside is that they have all the defaults inherent to stainless steel basins, which is that they are tough to keep shiny. In particular, the water is very hard at my place, and it makes it a pain in the neck to keep the water residue from building up."
5,incredible!,Amazing buy. This thing really can't be beat for the price. Switchable passive and active pickups plus a three band EQ give you any sound you want. Sound and playability are equal to some higher end ibanez's and esp's i've played. I command you to buy this.
2,toy,"Scratching on this blows. Sound quality is OK on PC speakers but when plugged into my pro DJ gear the sound quality is NO good. neat toy, worthless for using on any dance floor."
5,The Ben Hur of Sk8 films,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1985 and was not expecting much, as at the time the only skateboarding films I ever saw were really bad.I was shocked by how really good this film was. The skating was state of the art at the time which is great but the movies' strongest point is the arty style in which it was crafted. Peralta and Stecyk are a tremendous team and you can see their talent in this film. In away this is an art film disguised as a skate film. Subsequently I watched this film over and over and never got tired of it. Have seen a lot of skate films since and never seen one better than this."
5,Eldorado,"Eldorado was one of the best Pimpernel books . It starts of slowly with Armand and a couple of new characters then Percy gets heavily envolved followed by Marguerite, Ffoukles, and of course Chauvelin.The end is really exciting and as usual very masterly done. The intrigue in this book rests on the person who Sir Percy is trying to rescue. (No it's not Marguerite)"
3,A Great Two-Thirds of a Book I Couldn't Finish,"My title says it all. I ripped through the first two-thirds or so thinking this was one of the greatest non-fiction books I've read. I learned a ton about the business of food production I never knew, told in a excellent narrative style that made the book a page-turner. But then he went pig hunting and started to bore the bejesus out of me, and the mushroom hunt was even worse. I finally put the book down during the mushroom chapter, never to pick it up again. Five stars before the pig hunt, one star afterwords."
4,Half Time Review,"I've yet to finish Michael Pollan's latest, but I fully intend to. I find it the type of book that requires some ""time off"" before getting back to finishing it. It's chock full of neat stuff, but sometimes the prose bogs down and so does this reader's brain. I have not picked it up for a week, but I want to get back to it soon....with that said, this book is a must for serious foodies...if just to have in your library for when the whim hits to pick it up and read a chapter or two...Michael Pollan is a wonderful scholar and writer...and heck! he knows Alice Waters!!"
3,Needs a better editor.,"This book opened my eyes to industrial agriculture, both traditional and organic. It also inspired me to look for local farmers and shop at our local farmers market in season. I agree with Eric Woods that Pollan fell short in not recommending that people start growing their own food and making space for local farms.My biggest complaint with the book is that it does not need to be as long as it is. Pollan loves to hear himself ramble and repeat what he has elaborated on before. I kept thinking as I read the book that there was a lot that could have been edited out. When I read in the acknowledgements that he had followed his editor from one publisher to another, I knew why. He loves her because she doesn't cut any of his precious words!"
4,Enjoyable and Eye-Opening,"I typically do not read nonfiction; to me it's never as enjoyable as a fiction work. However, I have tried recently to broaden my literary taste and so decided to read The Omnivore's Dilemma. I'm glad I made such a choice. This book, for a nonfiction work, is very good. At times, the author deviates from his main point to provide further exposition, but the deviations never seem forced or unnecessary. The Omnivore's Dilemma was both enjoyable and eye-opening, and it ended in a poignant, poetic way. Even if you don't typically read nonfiction (like me) I would suggest this book."
2,Dilemma?,"One really wonderful thing about being an omnivore is the large choice of foodstuffs available for consumption. Nature has presented us with a precious gift, not a dilemma. Think of our poor uneducated forebears who without any anxiety about what they should eat, ate what was locally available. The good old days of moldy stored food and spoiled meat. The good old days of no greens in Winter and vitamin deficiencies that killed children and old people. Agribuisness is awful, save for the fact that it provides us with inexpensive nutritious food. The author is the worst sort of investigator, filled with beliefs that he uses poor research to validate.""What should we eat?"" Whatever we're hungry for. Pass the ketchup, please."
1,Boring,"This book had a lot of potential, but the narrative was uninteresting.Pollan is obviously passionate about food and its ramifications for society. However, this book reads like a textbook. It is overly dry and focused on facts.I couldn't get into it, even after giving it a second try."
1,Why Bother?,"Why bother reading a book that begins with the premise that humans are omnivores? Many experts believe humans are herbivores-search Google, you'll find many qualified articles on the subject. There are no ""dilemmas"" for herbivores-eat whole, plant based foods. And live a very long, vigorous life. The science is clear-it's pop culture that's confused. Read The China Study or Diet for a New America.The way to good health and a vastly improved environment could not be simpler or clearer:remember the four food groups; 5 servings of whole grains, 4 servings of veggies, 3 servings of fruit, 2 servings of legumes. Live long and prosper...and have great sex until your 90!"
1,Purchased but not available,"I was disappointed that the book was offered for purchase, but several days later, I was informed that I would reeive a refund because it was not available from the vendor. No offer was made to suggest the book from an alternate source. I had always assumed that if a book was listed, it would be available, and that the listing would be removed when there were no more to be sold."
2,Some good stuff but,"The stuff he leaves out due to his own limitations is vital. he goes through all the steps of making a burger but leaves out one of the most important and dramatic steps, the slaughter. Not worth reading, except that we eat a lot of corn."
3,Bad Disks - Twice,"When I discovered that a disk was bad, I contacted Amazon and they quickly sent a replacement package. Some of /those/ disks were bad, too, but between the two sets I had enough good disks to have one good set. Seems like the manufacturer went too far trying to have these CDs made at the cheapest price.Book is good, but I wouldn't want to repeat the experience."
4,MAKES YOUNG AMERICANS THINK,"My daughter read this and lost her knee-jerk revulsion of hunting. Thus this book may lead to greater understanding between urban and country folk---all for the good.My one comment was that when Pollan knelt by his hog and laid his hand on the rib cage he felt the need to give thanks, he ""knew not to what or whom."" Here is a modern man, striving to regain both humanity and maleness and he finds he has no creator to thank for his kill. We have lost much.The question is: can we regain what Pollan strives to regain without knowing whom to thank? without feeling within our own rib cage an unseverable connection to our creator, by whatever name? in whatever guise?I fear not."
3,"For me, it didn't add anything new","I already know a lot about food, nutrition, and agriculture so this book didn't really add anything."
2,Too Many Words,"I eagerly opened this book and plunged into a morass of words. How many does it take to complete a thought. Couldn't the author have read and applied Zinsser's book ""On Writing Well"" before tackling this meaty subject?The content is right on, but the message was obscured by the prose. Too bad. I would have liked to have finished it, but by the time I read a complete sentence or paragraph, there so many modifiers and conditional phrases, I lost the main point. I found it boring because of that.If someone edited this book, pulled out the content buried within and tightened his writing, Mr. Pollan could have made his point much better."
3,"Great book, sloppy editing","I loved this book, as I have loved Michael Pollan's others. However, reading it was an annoying experience because it is riddled with many typographical and editing errors of all types. It's as though nobody at the publishing company even read the draft before it was published, or an earlier draft was mistakenly sent to the printer. I have never seen so many errors in a published book. Indeed if this were any other type of product it would qualify as ""defective"" and be recalled and replaced by the manufacturer. The publisher should issue a corrrected version of this book and offer a free replacement to everyone who bought it."
5,Wow.,"As a broke college student, I started avoiding meat after reading books about food that revealed its actual composition and the horrific ethical problems with the factory farm industry. Reading The OD was an affirmation to invest in high quality meat that will nourish ourselves, the environment, the animals it comes from, and the farmers who care enough to do things the right way - not just the most inexpensive and convenient. It was a reminder that meat is a treat, something that should be eaten with gratitude for all that enables it, and that everything about eating at McDonald's is unnatural, unhealthy, and overall an utter lack of consciousness and knowledge. Pollan's writing is extremely smart, engaging, and funny, and the OD will likely affect your life."
5,Calling all Corn People - READ THIS BOOK!,"I read this book a little while ago and didn't have time to review it, but the essential messages keep popping into my consciousness as I go about my day-to-day life. Before reading this book, for example, I had never realized that Corn has cunningly taken over the world and turned us all into ""Corn People."" Pollan's simple plan - to make three meals - turns into an exploration of all things wrong with the modern industrial food production and delivery system. Pollan's prose is wonderful and his thinking nothing short of brilliant. Even if some of his ideas are not completely original, as some critical reviews argue, this is still a remarkable book that will enrich your life - and the world, if enough people read it."
5,an important book,"We get more sensitive about issues concerning life and death as we get older, and the questions relating to how much pain we are willing to cause other sentient beings in order to satiate our appetite is one we wrestle with until we die. This book is one of the most important contributions to the canon of who are we and what should we be doing. I don't think anybody should go to the next world without reading it and pondering the questions it poses. I believe that we avoid thinking about moral issues at our peril. As painful as they may be, they must be addressed."
4,Good and pretty book,Good and pretty book about good and ugly stuff. Exposed me to groups of information and inquiry in the thought and action regarding food industry
5,read this book,"Engaging from first page to last. An interesting, even compelling, read about our food supply, full of surprising information. If you like this book, go back and read Pollan's previous book, too."
5,"Beautifully written, terrific read","I originally checked this book out of my local library, thinking I'd scan it and read excerpts that interested me. I found it so engaging, however, that I just went back to page one and read it all the way through. It's a fascinating chronical of four different food systems. I never understood our industrial food system before and came away with a new understanding of what I'm actually eating when I buy processed food. It's sobering to realize how unnatural and unsustainable our current factory/industrial food system is. The bright light that shines through this book is that it doesn't have to be this way at all. This book is a pleasure to read, along with being powerfully informative. Highly recommended!"
3,"How much corn could a corn-chuck chuck, if a corn -chuck could chuck corn?","The Omnivore's Delemma is most definetly an interesting read, learning the history of corn is much more interesting than it sounds and to understand the role the government has played in the demise of the average farmer is quite shocking. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in agriculutre, vegetarianism or organic farming; however, I would like to add on this piece of advice: When you are reading this book, if you get to the point where you want to say ""I get it, it is all about corn... everything is about corn!"" then you have read enough on corn, skip to the middle of the book and start reading when the author begins to discuss a small farm in Virginia, you will not be missing anything in the 100 to 150 extra pages on corn."
4,Interesting and Entertaining Read,This book does an amazing and engrossing job of examining how our food ends up on our dinner table.
4,Fascinating!,"I grew up in farm country and have long had vague concerns about how national farm policy affects our food chain, but this book spelled it out for me in a way that was concrete and, really, life-changing. Bring on the grass-fed beef!"
5,Great Book for those who are interested and those who dont know where their food comes from!,I am a big supporter of agriculture and wanting to learn more about where our food comes from and how we can improve it. I was reguired to read this for two ag classes and love it!
2,"long-drawn-out, rambling, interminable, wordy, verbose,","Do not, repeat, do not believe the majority of reviews about this book. I should've known better as I first read ""Botany of Desire"", and gave a review. I thought that book was interminable, and this is even worse. Don't get me wrong there is some information within the pages, however, it goes on and on, almost without end. I persisted till I was almost, but not quite finished, and just could no longer bear the boredom. I persevered through ""The Corn"", barely got through ""The Grasses"", and almost made it through ""The Forest"", but the story on Fungi got the best of me, and ""The Perfect Meal"" did me in. I actually put the book down and stated aloud, ""enough - I can't take it anymore"". Life is too short, and time too valuable to waste it on this tripe."
5,Life Changging Read,"Two Thins changed my life. The first was the movie ""Who Killed the Electric Car"" and the second was this book "" ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"". I spent 2008 converting my 1999 Ford Ranger Pickup Truck to a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) as aresult of these two media. The first is obvious the second deserves an explanation. This book made me realize for the first time that there is a connection between the food supply and petroleum.I thought ok we run out of oil, so we walk or ride a bike or drive electric cars. It turns out, we also starve to death. We all need to connect the dots. Our oil economy is killing us. We need oil to drive the food supply."
4,Look Out!,"Reading this book might change the way you view the world and the food we consume. If you are not ready for a shift in your thinking, you are not ready for this book. I would have given it 5 stars but the writing style lags a little. The content, however, makes up for it.Yikes! What hath modern man wrought???"
5,Better than you think it will be,"This book was more intriguing, more interesting, more insightful, and more entertaining than I expected it to be. I thought it would be a completely out-in-left-field book full of impossible suggestions to things I didn't even consider problems. Instead, the author went about exploring in a very informative way, merely offering observations without being self-righteous or preachy. It did change the way I look at, if not food itself, the way it gets to me, and thinking of things I can do about that. My family got a little tired of me starting conversations with, ""in this book I'm reading..."" Definitely recommended!"
5,a must read,Important book for anyone who eats. Fascinating research and thoughtfully presented. Hopefully will be one of the most influencial books of our time.
5,Very engaging and readable!,"This book is very informative about our nation's food supply and makes a great case for organics. If you are interested in food and it's origins,this book is entertaining and yet very thought provoking. I'm usually a novels person, I must must say, this book has me thinking very time I go to the grocery store!"
4,Good but need a broader context,"The writing is really clear and I learned a lot from the book. Many reviewer had already said many good points about this book. So I would only share one disappointment here: the book was too much US centric. I would like to know more about how food is produced, on a global scale. Maybe your breakfast tomorrow was made in Brazil... With the currently trend of globalization, it is indeed relevant to US consumers."
3,Really enjoyed the first half of the book,"The first half of the book was informative and shed new light on our food system. I enjoyed the perceptive from the farmer in Iowa, the information from following a cow through the factory farms, and the grass farmer in Virginia. Once the book starting going into hunting and gathering it became more of a non-informative story. Then the last chapter with the meal was way to drawn out."
4,You'll think twice when you hear the dinner bell.....,"THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA is an informative, interesting read, though sometimes repetitious. In light of feeding growing populations and the drive by corporations for huge profits, it examines today's methods of producing our food supply, ones that are often unhealthy and inhumane. It is always valuable to understand what we eat, where it comes from, and the price we pay for our abundance. You'll think twice about the ""super size"" option!"
5,Life changing,"This book is amazing. It takes you on a culinary journey. The detailed process of how your food gets to your table and what it is made out of is shocking, horrifying and enlightening. Since reading this book I have changed the way I eat entirely. I was always fairly healthy but I am much more conscious of where I get my food from and I have enjoyed this change--from eating take out to preparing my own food from the farmers market and local grocery store. It's very well written, detailed, interesting and life changing. What more is there to say."
5,it takes one to know one,"only a hyperintellectual urbanic west coast hipster can take down one of west coast urban hipsterisms main exports: the 'supermarket pastoral' marketing machine that is whoring out the remnants of the counter culture.he gives us a bit o' insight into the workings of the food industry. process your food unnecessarily, and you make money off it. sell it raw, you get butkus. thats true whether youre selling chicken mcnuggets or organic olive oil and tarragon potato chips for 7 dollars a bag. walk into any 'natural foods store' and youll get the picture instantly.also, organic agriculture has no revolution as far as labor goes, and 'organic' and 'free range' are things that can be nitpicked and rules that have loopholes - so that if money can come from it, questionable practices will follow, and they do.the whole 'dinner' at the end made me cringe at the potential awkwardness of it, but i have to give the guy credit, he has huge brass cojones."
2,Boring and predictable...,"The ""reality TV show"" of novels. As a field biologist (botany specifically) for twenty plus years, I haven't found any of his books engaging, and in many cases they are off the mark scientifically. He really just states the obvious to anyone in America who isn't sleeping their way through life. Just study the life history of any species of plant in your front yard, or hanging off of your 10th floor building's cracked-wall, and you'll understand the whole book without ever having to read it."
5,Wow!,I was semi-vegetarian for the last few years. After reading this book I think I more than ever commited to stay out of any othe kind of food.
2,Not my taste,"Not what I was expecting. It was recommended by a friend, but it was more like a textbook than an informational read."
2,"A spoonful of truth, an avalanche of conspiracy theory","This is truly typical of the journalist that studies something and far too early in the game considers himself a World Authority. In this case he studied it long enough to become familiar with the terms but not to the point of actually knowing what all of them were, or hoping the reader doesn't. He uses compounds like citric and ascorbic acid and lecithin to instill terror into the omnivore's heart and, I suspect, would have us all become vegan organic farmers.Nice try, noble goal, but get real. Better nutrition by terror is an old, hackneyed theme. I actually think the author cares a lot more about making a bunch of money by selling his book than educating consumers about their food choices. If you don't already know what ascorbic acid is, do yourself a big favor and steer clear of this book."
3,"Timely topic, but hard to read","Book was chosen by my Book Club. First time in ten years, I did not finish the selection. Just couldn't stay awake! However, my friends for the most part enjoyed it, and we had a lively discussion."
4,"Good, but too much of an advertisement","This book comes down hard on fast food and makes you think twice about corn and why so many farmers are growing it in such large quanities. It also comes down on the organic food movement making you question what makes foods organic. It even questions the morality of eating animals making a good case for being a meat eater. I like the criticism, but the overly sentimental passages about a farm in VA and the local food movement were overdone. Those sections felt a little like an infomerical. Still, it was persuasive enough to get me to look at food in the grocery store in a different light. I would recommend this book."
3,Solipsist,"The Omnivore's Dilemma could have been a tour de force, a Silent Spring. But Michael Pollan is no Rachael Carson. Much of the research is sound, but what about fact checking, the case against as well as for, and where to go with his findings? Instead of science, we have solipsism, for Michael Pollan is more fascinated with Michael Pollan than scientific method, which is to say, he's a generalist, a journalist, an entertainer. He's preaching to the converted, the NYTimes readership; Michael wanted a best-seller, and he likely succeeded, no small feat and not unworthy. Someone else will follow, and those of us who are not in Pollan's congregation will have him to thank him for setting the stage."
4,How long until the 'Corn Famine' begins?,"This is the third book I've read Michael Pollan; it's my favorite, so far. Such a fascinating discussion about food - our relationship with it, the way we as a society try to regulate it for ourselves and others, and our need to turn a blind eye or have a stiff upper lip every time we go to the grocery store. Wondering how long until the 'Corn Famine' begins ..."
4,The Omnivore's Dilemma,"This book was quite interesting. It taught me the importance of knowing where food comes from. It was actually a bit disgusting in some parts of it. Overall, it was an eye opener."
3,couldn't finish it,"i love listening to michael pollen, but am unable to read the long winded explanations. don't get me wrong, non-fiction and higher level reading is what i love, but i just could not get into the book. start with the movie Food, Inc, and then go to supersize me then move on from there. the subject matter has changed my life."
3,"Interesting , BUT....",Lots of fascinating facts leading to an extreme point of view. Basically too long and intense to suit my interest in the subject.
4,A Very Interesting Read,"I have friends who are ""health nuts"" and ""food purists""....I have pretty much blown them off until now. Michael Pollan masterfully documents elements of the food chain and how we eat. I am an omnivore, and now I don't know what I should eat! It is indeed a dilemma!I found particularly interesting the history of corn, the government subsidies instituted in the 1970's and how this has led to industrialized farming. Did you know that high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)wasn't even invented until 1980? Now it's in everything. No wonder this country has a problem with obesity!"
4,An insightful book about how our food becomes our food.,"The best reason to recommend this book is Pollan's entertaining writing. He takes the relatively mundane yet preachy subject of American food production and turns it into an intriguing journey. His descriptions of weighing the organic backstory on boxes at Whole Earth Foods or killing chickens at Polyface Farms are strangely inviting and funny.If you are serious about the subject of organic food, it is a good read. If you are a little more skeptical or even put off by the organic food crowd, then you will enjoy reading a well-considered look at different ways that your food may reach your plate. Pollan looks closely at the subject without expecting you to trade-in your dollar menu for couscous.Kasey Cotulla[..]Sacramento"
5,Fantastic book on our food supply,"Focusing mostly on corn this book just drives home the point that corn subsidies have ruined the American farmer and made us fat. Its about taking a system that works well after millions of years of evolution and industrializing and it explains all the problems this creates. A great book along with Fat Land, Fast Food Nation and Don't Eat this Book."
5,Must read book for every American,This book is a must read for every American who is interested in understanding the reason for all the food related problems that this country has.
4,Ignorance is NOT Bliss,"Finally a well written book that makes people think about our dependence on animals and our planet. For a real eye-opener, I suggest buying or renting the documentary ""Earthlings"". Narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, it has won several awards. You will never look at food, or our treatment of animals, in the same way again. Not for the faint of heart, but I wish every person on this planet were forced to watch it."
5,Modern Feedlot,"This is a great book to see where your food comes from, and just how it got there.I would recommend for all ages from Middle School to Alzheimer's"
3,Interesting but should have been cut by 1/3 to 1/2,"Pollan is too impressed with himself, has too much money, and too much time to indulge himself. The info is useful if there weren't so much about him and his views in it. His rambling and self-satisfied tone grew tiresome and irritating. Journalism? Not."
3,Fascinating,A fascinating view of our food supplies.Apart from one very bad glaring mistake it is a damn good read.The mistake? The brain does not need glucose to function. The brain functions perfectly well on ketones (derived from fat).Apart from the above nonsense it is a great read.
3,"okay, but slightly disappointed",Book took longer to arrive than I expected and there were stains on the top that were not included in the description.
4,Everyone should read this!,This was a great book and very eye opening. Since reading it I have really started to make a serious conscious look into what I eat and where it comes from. Since reading it I also have picked up a few of the books written by Joel Salatin the owner to Polyface Farms.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of his hunter gather sections. He got into all of this philosophical whiny stuff about hunted animals and his internal struggle blah blah. Plus besides the hunting compared to the rest of the book this section was not too realistic for most people to do anyways.All in all a great book and a must read (you can skip the last section though)
3,"GREAT READ, BUT..","This book is loaded with great information about our food sources. I do think, however, that the same information could have been written in a much more condensed version."
5,Best Agricultural Non-fiction since The Jungle,This book dives deeper into American agriculture than any book before it. Without sounding condescending Pollan brilliantly reveals the complexity of the food industry in the modern era. A must read book for anyone who eats food.
5,Excellent,I love this book. It changed the way I see my food and taught me about industrial farming. I think anyone who is interested in nutrition should read this.
3,Omnivore's drudgery,"While this book is chocked full of information, it is a slog to read. And frankly I can't ferret out if the information is true or hype to make a point--hit over the head over and over and over again."
3,Did I say repetitive?,"Overbearing, didactic, repetitive, over-bearing (did I say that already?) and preachy...thats the minus 2 stars for writing.Also. Clearly accurate and fact based. Could have conveyed his points to his audience with half the words but it as a topic it is still worth reading...just skip every other sentence."
2,Made it to chapter 2,I could not even finish the book. When the author began talking about how corn could not exist without humans I just had to give the book up. Clearly he is making assumptions with no facts to back it up.
4,First half of book is stellar,"I knew almost nothing about the growth of food in America prior to the reading this book. I thought it was interesting and easily accessible book. I found the first few parts very interesting, and a good way to explore different ways to feed the population. However, the last portion on him creating his own meal appeared to be more of a personal diary entry than an argument or discussion on the benefits for the population as a whole. As even he said, he knew that hunting and gathering is not a realistic way to feed the population of the world. Regardless, it is a good read overall."
5,Changed my way of thinking,"This book completely changed my way of thinking about food. I've always been very interested in the consequences of our food choices, but Pollan took me several steps further into that process. Pollan didn't write this book to convince anyone of anything, and I really appreciate that. Instead, it represents his own search for the truth and meaning behind our daily bread, and as we travel with him, our own search. There are no clear answers, no absolute rules to adhere to, and Michael Pollan fully respects that.When I read this book, I couldn't help but telling people what I learned, and saying ""You've really got to read this."" On so many levels... It's a fascinating and utterly compelling read on the one hand, and full of things you want everyone to think about on the other hand."
4,Nutritious Reading,I recommend this for book for anyone interested in getting a good general feel for how food production currently works and exploring ideas of sustainable food production. The book is well written and provides enough startling facts and anecdotes to keep one reading.
4,Informative,"Although the pace of the narrative faltered at times, the book was informative without being boring. I even incorporated a few lifestyle changes after reading it. Definitely a worthy read but not necessarily something you rush out to the bookstore to get."
4,Richly informative!,"I've recommended this book to my friends, meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans, and those who are into the ""organic"" food craze. I'm a meat-eater myself, and the best thing I was able to relate to them was that, in most cases, ""organic"" still means processed and industrialized. Even ""free-range"" chickens aren't treated any better than other industrial chickens. And from what I've gathered, those who eat ""meat/protein substitutes"" are filling their bodies with more processed products than a good hearty steak."
5,A thorough examination of American food,"This book gives an excellent overview of our current food system (Big Ag) and helped me sort truth from myth. As Pollan clarifies his thoughts and feelings on the issues, I was able to do the same. And he includes health, environmental, and spiritual/emotional aspects of the subject as well. An excellent resource, and very well-written."
2,The Omnivore's Dilemma: How the food industry maximizes profits.,"The Omnivore's Dilemma: Too depressing! Consists of horror stories about the food industry. All too true, and a good subject, but no fun to read about. Neal Thorpe"
5,The Omnivore's Dilemma,"Recommended to me by a friend, this book will change my dietary habits for life. Sometimes it gets a bit ""over the top"" and some of the wording gets a bit ""over my head"", yet the content and the references to the literature are outstanding. Over all I find the book entrancing, and though I am only 1/3 rd through it, I spend almost all my ""free"" time reading it."
1,misguided - intellectually dishonest,Mr. Wolfson's first mistake in his thesis is the lack of acknowledging that he is working to re-define marriage. I completely discredit his work. Do not waste your time with this book. Instead try Mr. Sullivans recent contribution to the spirited debate.
2,Not Worth It,We did not see any sea monkeys because they are so sensitive that if the conditions were not exactly right then they don't work. Sorry but I felt this was very disappointing and my children were disappointed that they did not hatch.
3,"Only ONE ""monkey"" lived.","This was a HUGE disappointment. We followed the directions exactly.3 eggs hatched, but two died right off. Only ONE male monkey grew for a few weeks, then he started rolling around the bottom and died.He was cute while he was alive. We did enjoy that much."
4,An enjoyable journey of Transcontinental Cuisine.,"Tony is the former Executive Chef of the Russian Tea Room. He and his wife Lisa,a premier pastry chef, have transformed an old home into the finest fine dining stop in Palm Beach County. This cookbook reflects the restaurant beautifully with simple, yet flavorful recipes. Three musts to try at home are: the Lobster Nori Rolls, Grilled Rib Eye braised in Barolo Sauce, and Lisa`s famous Key Lime Mousse Tart. Tony and Lisa conduct cooking classes at the restaurant which makes this book easy for the home cook to handle. A must buy for fusion cooking lovers everywhere."
5,Great for those who suffer from Corn Allergies---,Having a daughter with corn allergies is frustrating. I can now at least bake cookies/cakes and make frostings that do not contain any form of corn.Great product at a great price. I will continue to purchase from this dealer on Amazon.
2,Lumps,You have to deal with lumps. I tried sifting it and in the sifter i found hard little lumps that will not break up. Flavor is fine though. I started using Florida Crystal brand and it works great hardly have to sift it.
1,Must to avoid!,"Fair Trade, yes. My daughter says they should call it ""Fair Trick"". I love some of the other Wholesome Sweetener products, particularly the dark brown sugar, but this one is lumpy, tasteless, and grey! Looks and tastes like spackle. Have to sift to remove the mothball-like clumps. I get fooled by this stuff about once a year around the holidays when I'm feeling all joy to the world and making baked goods with organic ingredients I can afford about once a year. And then I remember: organic powdered sugar is kind of like organic Cheeteos. If you're going to do it, might as well go with the real thing. You'll be twice s happy and spend about half as much."
3,No allergy but caked up!,"I have food allergies and was glad to find out that this sugar does not contain corn. However, is was caked up into big chunks that i can not completely break down - and i got it for making chocolate bars.. Trying to blend it in with a stick blender resulted in a lot of the chocolate mass stuck on the blender. Ok product, but not hastle-free..."
2,"Tori, for once, makes a...no two mistakes...","I am the most die hard Tori Fan you will ever meet. I have all of her work, from Baltimore to Merman, however, this is the one single I have gotten that has left me less than interested. Jackie's Strength is of course very beautiful, however it begins to wear thin. As for ""Never Seen Blue"" and ""Beula Land"", well there's not much to say. They're boring! I know I'm going to be crucified (get it? Crucify <now there's a good song>) for this over at my Tori web ring, but its true. They are both draggy and slow. Its like the same song broken into two tracks. If your diehard tori fan like me, buy it, but don't expect to listen to it more than once. Otherwise spend two more bucks for a good single, or ten for one of her CD's, caz I can see why she did't include these songs on Boys for Pele, and it wasn't diskspace! The only reason I'm giving it two stars at all is because of the videos, which are nice."
4,Finding My Religion,"Track #2, ""Beulah Land"", is a song you must hear if you have ambivalent feelings toward your family's religion. ""Tell me when I don't need you anymore""... ""Maybe I don't wanna go to where you're not""... Since I don't get anything spiritual out of gospel music - yet am very concerned about religion - it's Tori's songs like these which help me find expression for my mixed-up feelings about Christianity. ""Never Seen Blue"" is beautiful as well, and haunting. These B-sides are worth adding to your collection of Tori songs."
5,I think your life just might change a little...,"I don't think I have the words to explain how beautiful this single is. Jackie's Strength was not one of my favorites from the album, but I needed the B-sides.""Never Seen Blue"" has become my all time favorite Tori song. It has a dream-like quality that most artists can't even touch. Put this on with your morning cup of coffee, really.There's also something about the piano in this song that sends chills through you. It's beautiful and if you are a fan, you must hear it. (If anyone reading this was at the Salt Lake show for the ""Venus"" tour, you've heard it. It was one of the last songs she sang before her encore. It was a rare arena experience.)-- If anyone would like to hear the story about her playing Never Seen Blue in Salt Lake, email me (blankfrank71@hotmail). It's a good one.""Beulah Land"" is also an excellent song. Reminiscent of ""Way Down"" on Pele. Also one of my favorites. This is by far one of the best singles Tori has released."
4,"Tori fans, rejoice","""Jackie's Strength"" is no doubt one of Tori's best songs. ""Never Seen Blue"" and ""Beulah Land"" compliment it perfectly, and they make this single worth owning. So many bands/artists slap remixes on singles and call it good. Tori is known for putting never-before-heard songs on her singles, making them a real treat for any of her fans. ""Never Seen Blue"" alone would be reason enough to buy this. It has gorgeous lyrics and, of course, wonderful piano. ""Beulah Land"" is a little less breath taking but is amazing none the less. If you like anything that Tori Amos has done, you'll love this single."
4,Fans of the soft and sad sides of Tori will rejoice,"There are many reasons to buy this single, the main one being for ""Beulah Land"" the third and last song on the single. If you are even reading this review, it probably means you are a big tori fan (like me) and so this is not a single you should miss out on. All three songs are great but you should get this for the two b-sides. The only reason I gave it four stars out of five was because I was slightly disappointed with ""never seen Blue"", which at times has the same melody as ""Muhammed my friend"" from ""Boys for Pele"""
5,Safety First!,I placed this on my daughter's wagon and it has not peeled and is safe at night. We used it during Halloween and other neighborhood get togethers in the evening. Great reflective tape!
5,Longtime fan,"After hearing Yves Duteil live in Geneva in 1978, I purchased this album shortly before returning to the U.S. I have nearly worn out the LP and, over the years, have tried everything I could, short of going back to France or Switzerland, to get my hands on more of his music. Thank goodness for the Internet. Duteil has an angel voice and his lyrics are enchanting."
5,Tarentelle -Yves Duteil,"This is a very lyrical, melodic and charming album and one of Yves Duteil's best. He carves and chisels his verses into songs and his music is mesmerizing. This album is my favorite of all the numerous CDs I have in French."
5,Algebra Workbook For Dummies,"Nobody liked Algebra when I was in school, or maybe that's because there wasn't a helpful book such as this. This starts with the basics, and works it's way thru more complicated equations. That's exactly what a teacher is to do, in fact most should make some copies of a few pages. I always dislike the 'Dummies' word in the title, very demeaning, especially for a younger person. Other than that, it's great, with dead-on questions & EXPLANATIONS."
5,Easy learning,Shipped extremely fast from seller it made my head spin. Very easy to follow format of self learning.
3,Book and Workbook not Complementary,"I enjoyed the study guide and was making progress when I decided to open the workbook. I thought the workbook would be a companion to the study guide. In other words, I thought chapter one of the workbook would relate to chapter one of the study guide with further exercises for study. However, they are not related. Both the study guide and the workbook have their value, but they can be looked at as two separate courses of study."
5,good review and fun,About 180 pages into it and I'm actually having fun!The example problems are great but the solutions at the end of the chapter are sometimes a bit confusing (but they clear themselves up if you chew the problem a little and remember what you're supposed to be learning in that given chapter).I've only found one typo in an answer so far (signs reversed).Learning a few things I never heard of before for example Pascal's Triangle.Skip around and focus on the weak areas. I'd buy it again.Bought it for a review before returning to college after a seven year break from school (if you can really call the military a break).
2,Misleading name,The product was more of a review for those who already had an understanding of algebra. I was disappointed that it didn't give a step by step teaching of how to do it. I found it still very complicated for beginners and would not recommend it to a beginner. It should not be in the dummy line.
2,Order with a magnifying glass!,"Although the review content is well written, I would not purchase this book again. Some of the fractions are typed in bold and are of a decent size buy many of the fractions throughout are written in such small text that they are almost impossible to decipher - even with good vision and bright light!"
1,False Advertising,As others have stated the reel has very low storage capacity. It has adequate capacity for a 50 foot extension cord. It could probably handle 150 foot of lamp cord. If you are looking for a reel to hold a longer outdoor extension cord this is not it; recommend you continue searching.
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"Advertised to hold 150 feet of 16 ga cord, 125 feet of the 14 ga, well 100 feet of the 14 ga will not fit unless you spend hours winding it on perfectly, good for a 50 foot 14 ga cord."
3,Does what I need it to,"It's cheap though not too cheaply made, and it winds up my 100' cord far easier and neater than winding it around my arm or trying to coil it. No way could it do 150', and heavier than 16 gauge probably couldn't hold more than 75'."
3,"Worth the price, but needs a cover","At the 10$ I paid, I feel that the reel is worth the price, but with 100+ feet of 14 gauge extension cord, it's difficult to reel it neatly enough that it fits properly. So, to do it correctly takes about the same time as using your arm."
2,Discription is Inaccurate,I received this today with my 100' 14-3 extension cord. The 100' 14-4 does not fit on this reel. I gave it two stars for being a good design but a lousy description.
2,Small Capacity,"The label on this product itself says ""125ft Maximum"", and that's a big stretch. This is a product you should probably select in person."
5,Could not put this down!,"I just simply loved this book and could not put it down. I read it all in one day. This was very exciting and kept me guessing what was going to happen next. It did an awesome job of developing the characters on an individual basis while at the same time showing what was happening in the world on a broader scale. I generally don't like too many subplots, but the romance subplot in this book was excellent. While ""Megiddo"" may not be as Biblically accurate as the Left Behind series, I find it much more entertaining to read. As a Christian I feel believers and non-believers alike will enjoy this book.I am definitely looking forward to seeing the movie version when it comes out in theatres!"
1,More of a screenwrite than a book.,Very disappointed after reading his first book. Gave it away to the local library. I expected a book - not a book about the movie
3,Bongoland,"I have all of Cecelia's CD's and this one has, to my ears, a strange sounding mix. I like the other ones much better."
1,Description Should Warn it Contains Lactose,"Product description didn't mention this product contains lactose. So many of us (especially with digestive problems) are lactose intolerant. Why is lactose needed, anyway? Other probiotics do not contain lactose, dyes or any other unnecessary inactive ingredient."
2,Used for Ulcerative Colitis,"Florastor was recommended by my son's doctor to help curb his colitis and restore beneficial bacteria. However, florastor uses milk products in the manufacturing of their capsuels, and it increased the number of bowl movements, and increased his flair-ups. If someone has severe colitis, we recommend a probiotic such as VSL#3. It has a greater number of beneficial bacteria, and the traces of milk used in the manufacturing process appears to be insignificant. If you purchase VSL#3, purchase it from the manufacture. They have the best pricing and ship for free."
3,ok,"I bought them for what they said they would help with,didn't work for me and price was too high, but may work for you."
1,my own colonoscopy prep,"i started taking florastor once a day and immediately got up to 18-20 bowel movements a day. i have ulcerative colitis and this really hurt my gut. i am saving it to use as my next colonoscopy prep, but there is no way i would take this as an every day probiotic. if you have SEVERE constipation, then it will help you dramatically."
2,Didn't help,"Tried this for a month. Didn't really help with my IBS, but then nothing else has either. . . ."
1,Not Vegan,"This product is deceptive and some people think it is acceptable for vegans, but they add lactose and I did confirm with the company that the lactose is from cow stomach."
5,Amazing,"I've had ibs-d for nearly 30 years, and nothing has every helped me as much as Florastor has. My doc recommended it after a bout of stomach flu, and I was amazed at how quickly it normalized my gut. I'm eating things I've never been able to eat without a major ibs flare up."
4,"Great product, but don't feel any difference after a while.","Received this from a doctor for food poisoning in samples. This nuked the food poisoning in just a few hours. Worked well. A couple months later, I got food poisoning again. Decided to invest in this for protection. Got my system going again. Once you are healed and use it as a vitamin, you won't really feel a difference as if you didn't take it. It's all on you to keep a good system going. All in all, this product works quite well."
5,Excellent,This product was cost effective and worked quite well. I now have the infection under control. It is a good product to take for anyone who is on antibiotics since the medicine kills the natural bacteria in the system.
4,Needed for my Pentax Camera,Have been looking for these for my camera. They arrived on time and were just as advertised.I would recomend these batteries.
2,Good price - poor performance,"These died exceptionally quickly. I did not check to see how long they had been sitting around before they got to me, but they did not last even a single roll of film."
1,Same story as the rest...,"Same with my T2984. PS died an fried the whole board. However, I have had two other brand PS die at work and both the PC were perfectly fine after I replced the PS on them."
1,Almost junk,"It worked for sometime so that is why I said ""almost""First the PSU died. Replaced the PSU. A year later the motherboard is toast.These are major issues. Need to do some troubleshooting to see if the HDD is ok."
2,Not Impressed,"I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed with this set of recordings. I had seen the movie, The Eddie Duchin Story, and was curious about his music. (I am also a piano playing pharmacist like Eddie.) However, the quality of the piano playing in the movie is significantly better than on this CD. Sorry."
1,"worthless garbage, waste of money","Its been two months, and the ants never came despite contact with the company. Meanwhile the gel has dried up. Money wasted. Child disappointed"
1,Please DO NOT buy this!,"I don't usually write negative reviews. But this 'Toy' is so sad that I really feel an obligation to warn people not to purchase it. The ants usually arrive dead. We were lucky once and had 3 that were alive. My children were so sad for the ants that were missing heads, legs etc. Then some of the dead ones fell between the gel and wall and started to mould. I could not remove them and the surrounding gel turned yellow with streaks of white mold growing around, this area got larger and larger until I finally threw the whole unit away. The ants never dug tunnels, they merely slid down the sides between the gel and habitat wall. Mostly they just stayed on the top. My children asked me to get rid of it because it made them feel 'yucky'.I really don't think this should be sold at all."
1,4+ months waiting and no ants,"My son was thrilled to receive his ant colony for Christmas and couldn't wait for the ants. So far, all we've received is a series of lame postcards saying they're still waiting for ants to ship. As my son said ""In a couple more weeks, we can find our own!"" I rated it 5 stars for durability because it's sitting on the shelf abandoned at this point. This toy was a total bust and I would like a refund."
4,Ants are cool!,"Pretty fascinating habitat...the instructions are easy to follow, the ants are digging like crazy, and my two kids love 'em! The lighted mini-aquarium is sturdy, the ants arrived in the mail as advertised, and the tunnels are quite interesting.While these ants may bite, if you follow the instructions, you never get close to touching them. Bottom line - my kids really enjoy this colony. I can't recommend naming the ants, though, they all look sort of alike!"
1,What ants???,"I ordered the ants in December (Christmas present), and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout January, no ants arrived. I have called several times, with the same excuse. They have my money and won't deliver the ants.I would suggest any other company besides Uncle Milton Industries."
1,Watch out for a faulty toy,"I got this ant farm for my son and it was not worth it at all. the ants showed up dead so we caught our own. within two houurs they escaped without our kowledge. there is a small pin size hole above where the tubes go, and they all got out of it. the next thing i knew, i was squishing ants in his room. such a rip off."
1,Tried to rate it zero stars,"This was a Christmas gift for my grandaughter. The ants were to be shipped when the temperature was warm enough and we received an email stating the ants were on their way, two months ago. I thought the ants would be mailed to us because we paid shipping, but this must have been traveling money for them to walk here. Every day we go to the post office to pick them up, and every day she is disappointed. Uncle Milton is a mail order scam."
1,Not happy with gel colony,"I just wanted to give my review on this product as I'm sure lots of folks out there will spend money on it for their kids... if it worked it would be very nice.. but as others mentioned the weather has to be ""just right"" for them to ship the ants which means the gel may or may not be in the right conditions when they arrive (even if it is wrapped in plastic which it was). The ants took a very long time to arrive. After a week or so I too had the white moldy stuff growing everywhere on my son's ant farm. Recently, I just couldnt look at it or the dying ants any longer, so I let them go in my backyard. If I bought a product like this again I would get the sand version as that's what I had as a kid and I remember it working fine.. Good luck to all!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"My son received the ant gel farm for Christmas. I knew the ants weren't included and that I had to request them ASAP since I live in Southern California and it said that they'll ship the ants weather permitting. Since it gets to hot here. I sent the 4 dollar check in December. It has been two months and we haven't received the ants or when we might get them. But they sure cashed the check in time.Since its taking to long, we got some ants locally. We caught them in the park. I used this type of ants before in the sand type ant farms and they worked okay. With the gel farm the ants didn't do much. I poked the gel with the stick and they only did a 1/2 inch hole and thats it.Don't waste your money with this product. It was a big disapointment for my son."
2,You get what you pay for,"Take home message: If you want a gel ant colony invest in a more expensive version like AntWorks!I bought 6 of these farms for a school project, and I chose them because they were the cheapest of the gel variety. And well, I got what I paid for. After enjoying other great gel colony products like AntsWorks, I was quite disappointed in ""Uncle Milton's"" product. First, the gel smells God awful. Second, the tops of some of mine had a milky goo that the ants got stuck in and died. Third, the gel did not fill the entire enclosure and some ants got wedged between the gel and the wall...and died. Fourth, the lids are quite hard to snap on and make me question the ""escape proof"" claim. Fortunately, I didn't use the coupon to buy the ants. If you wants ants fast, go to Antsalive.com. They're a great company and you'll get ants in under 2 weeks."
1,Don't bother! BIG RIPOFF UNCLE MILTON,"Got this for my son's birthday. Waited 2 months for the 'included ants'. You have to mail off for them and pay 9.95 that doesn't sound included to me! In the 2 months we waited for the ants the gel separated from the glass. Once we got the ants the majority of them died within the 1st 2 hrs. others got stuck in the gapping holes where the gel separated while we waited for our 'included ants'. I think that about 3 of the ants are still alive, its only been 2 days since we got the ants. Not worth the money invested! My son was really into seeing them tunnel and make their home. BIG RIPOFF UNCLE MILTON!"
1,mold on dead ants,Ants took forever to arrive. They arrived dead or perhaps very cold I thought. Put them in the farm. The next daythey were yep still dead except one was growing an incredible amount of mold on it. Yuck. Trying to get a full refund. By now the gel is unuseable and who knows how contaminated the farm is. Complete waste of money.
1,Sad & cruel,"Had an ant farm as a kid and the ants lived a long, long time, creating tunnels, hauling little branches around, eating the provided food.This product is just torturous and cruel. Avoid it like the plague. No kid should be taught that this is an acceptable way to treat any living creature. Really sad and cruel."
2,Shortlived,"It also took us about 8 weeks to receive our ants. When we received them, they were all alive except for one or two. I didn't count them, so I don't know exactly how many there were alive. We followed the directions precisely and the ants started to dig tunnels, but then they all died within three days. What a disappointment after waiting so long to get them. I'm going to try to return the item, but I'm concerned it's been too long since the purchase date. After reading others' reviews I'm not going to try to deal with the company. Great idea for a product, but not what it advertises to be."
4,my daughter loves it,"I bought this product before I looked at the reviews, so I had little expectations since it had such a low rating. As stated before in other comments, the ants took 8-9weeks to arrive in the mail. Set up was easy. Within a week the ants started digging a tunnel, and now a little over a month later there are several tunnels throughout the gel. There was a little bit of mold from dead ants at the top, but I scooped it out with a clean metal spoon, and there seems to be no problem since. My daughter received this as a gift from us for her fifth birthday, and loves it. Everyone who comes to our house is fascinated by ant farm. A great educational gift. I would highly recommend it."
2,Not good for warm/humid climate,"Like others have noted about this product, you may have to wait awhile for your ants depending on where you live. My son received his ant farm for his birthday in June, but due to the heat here in Houston, he didn't get any ants until October. Unfortunately, the gel started to mold a couple of weeks after we put the ants in it and I just ended up dumping the whole thing into the yard yesterday because the poor ants were overwhelmed with mold in their home. The gel was fine while we waited for the ants to arrive because I kept the original plastic cover on top of it, but as soon as it was exposed to the air for a while, it was a mess. We're going to try a more traditional sand farm next time,...."
1,NO TUNNELS,"As others have mentioned it took several months to get the ants. My son was so excited when he got this for his birthday and was disappointed over and over again when he asked when his ants were going to be here. The ants are living on top of the gel and not digging tunnels. A few attempted to move away from the top only to get stuck in the gel or fall down the sides and die. My husband finally put a little sand on top for the 5 ants still alive and they are moving around a lot more. However, after reading other reviews I expect that it will start molding. The frog habitat stinks too. We had more luck getting tadpoles out of a fountain and keeping them in a bucket. I have to agree with my 5-yr old ""they want you to buy their toys and they don't work!"""
1,Worthless and frustrating,"We had no problems receiving our ants - they came promptly and were healthy. For a day. Within hours the ants just started dying - the survivors piled all the dead ones in one spot on the top of the gel. A few valiant soldiers last for a couple of weeks, but they NEVER started tunnelling - they just crawled around on top of the gel and their dead friends. My sons were VERY disappointed in this experiment - I might be inclined to try a traditional ant farm - but never this again."
1,"Horrible, moldy mess!","What a terrible, cruel ant farm. The gel farm arrived fine, but from day one smelled of curdled milk. I ordered ants from a competitor after some research and knowing they'll probably arrive dead months later if I used the form which came with this farm. All ants arrived alive and active, about a week after I placed the order online. Put them in, and by second day mildew formed on all walls, gel on top and sides turned into puddles of disgusting soup and gel separated from walls and started to mildew - it stunk inside! Ants never dug tunnels, just remained on top of the disgusting, runny gel. What a nightmare. Had to throw out, very sad for the ants. Please, do not buy this product, no matter how discounted it is."
5,A Juicy Astrological Nail Biter,"As a Western Astrologer, I could easily relate to his many learning experiences, and his dealing with getting the value of astrology out to the public; neither are easy tasks. I felt he shared his experiences honestly and from the heart. I enjoyed his book and found it to be an easy and interesting read for the astrological seeker. I highly recommend it. It certainly has captivated my interest to learn about vedic astrology."
3,"One Great Song, The Rest Are Good to Okay","Anders Manga has a pretty good vibe on this album, but I'm only in love with one song: Beautiful, which is the track you should crank up loud and sing along with. The video is really good, too. The other songs are just ""meh"" for me."
1,Wouldn't know if it's any good or not,Wish I had known how old this software title is and that it wouldn't run on my computer. Complete waste of Money. Sounded like a perfect game. Hope they update it for this century.
1,Turkey Tetrazzini six pouch scam,"I have ordered many thousands of dollars in merchandize, including clothing, camping equipment, tools, food, books and gifts in the last several years. I have always been happy or extremely happy with the merchandise I have ordered combining price, quality and ease of delivery.My pleasant experience ended with this order. I ordered six pouches of turkey tetrazzini and only one was delivered and I was charged for six.Can you imagine going to a retail store and seeing the person ahead of you on line asking for one pouch and being charged $7. They you ask to purchase the six pouch version, are handed one pouch and are charged $30.What a disgrace."
5,Amazing Sound,"This is an amazing product, the sound is clear and with high quality. I'm really impressed with that.It looks beautiful, its design is cool. The additional charging system allows you charge your phone and listen your music at the same time...Excellent!!!"
3,"It's cute, but not spectacular","I think my expectations for this product may have been too high. It looks nice, very sleek, and it charges my phone while playing music. However, the radio reception for certain stations wasn't much better than the headphones, as I had hoped. The two stubs that connect the stand to the speakers aren't too durable. I broke one trying to remove the stand (but it still holds up). There also isn't as much base as I would like.However, it is pretty compact- can't go wrong with flat speakers. And it's nice to have a stand to sit my phone in, because I can just look over and see who's calling when it rings, and the music does cut off when it rings.I say this is perfect if you need something on the go (it can take batteries) or needs something to sit at the office with. And the sale price isn't bad. It's definitely not worth the original price."
4,Excellent sound,"I own the Sony Ericsson W810i, and this very small system, is a perfect match for it. This unit has a terrific sound for it's size, and I use it every day as my office sound system. The unit works with all of Sony Ericsson's cell phones, which incorporate the ""Walkman"" sound system. The phones built in radio and MP3 files, need a headset to serve as antenna, but one can hook it to the music stand, and it becomes a small radio set with a very good fidelity. At the same time, the stand serves as a battery charger too. The sound is quite astunding, when one consider the miniscule size of the stand. I only wish that it had another output to connect to the computer. 4.5 stars out of 5."
4,Good and solid product,"Good product that will charge your phone while playing music. Sound quality is very good for its size. Don't expect a big stereo sound. One thing about the volume : every time you dock your phone, the volume level goes back to a preset level no matter what level you set when you took your phone off the dock( not a biggy). Compact enough to travel with you.Amazon's customer service was superb. Price was reduced by $15.00 after I purchased it and they gladly refunded that amount."
4,good speaker..,hmmm... its pretty nice.. only sad thing is they dropped the price further after I purchased :(decent enough sound and pretty much portable.
1,Warning! This book is not suitable for children or teens!,My 10-year old daughter was reading this book for school. She brought to my attention that the book contained explicit sexual descriptions and profanity. To my shock the irresponsible publisher (Penguin Putnam/Puffin books) has recommended this book for ages 10 and older. I am thankful that I have a daughter that is more prudent and responsible than the publishers who ask us to trust them.
2,Not very long lasting,After two years of use there are holes/rips in the material even where there is no apparent stress points (front center of hood near window and sides by door windows). It is not water-proof and the material even when new is susceptible to rips and tears if pulled too hard. I need to have it replaced and I cannot recommend this product.
5,car cover,i actually bought this because someone was vandalizing my car and the single ply i had wasn't saving it. this one is a triple ply and you can't beat the price. it was cheaper than the single ply i got at autozone so now i have a four ply that works great. it has a sack holder that's actually big enough to fold the cover into. it's fantastic and i'm glad i was able to find it. it says not for wagons but it fit my scion xb wagon wonderfully. it's elastic all the way around and you can really see the difference between the two covers i have. i highly recommend.
5,Model,Purchased for a 9 year old who expressed an interest in this hobby. Something fun for a dad and son.
4,Description incorrect,"I purchased this from Plow & Hearth on-line. It is not 24"" square (a size I really was searching for). When I received it it was only 22"". I called P & W - they know the description is incorrect. Otherwise, quality of fabric is good but it seems as if the foam doesn't fill out all the way into the fabric."
