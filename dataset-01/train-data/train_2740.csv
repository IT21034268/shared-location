4,Really perceptive book,"Keenly written book, shows the depth of Watts Humphrey's experience. Greatly rewarding for anyone who is willing to look at situations without applying oppressor/oppressed stereotypes. The book will sail cleanly over the heads of those who do not have at least 4-5 years of hands-on management experience, and will boink the others between the eyes. The sections where he talks about why technical people appear dissatisfied and how managers fail them were just amazingly useful once I forgot to fight the contents."
3,Brooklyn All Stars,"I heard the Brooklyn All Stars performing ""...On The Banks of Jordan.."", one Sunday morning on the radio, and I was instantly hooked. I made this purchase just for them and I am very happy to have the lovely 2-disc set w/ all the gospel greats. The other artists are just the ""cherry on top""."
3,Falls short but still sounds great...,"Soundwise, it's great. The visuals, great. But when they start censoring a Tori show to bypass the parental guidance sticker in order to sell it at Wal Mart?? Insane. Her live shows are known to be peppered with the 4 letter words... For those that have seen her shows, the solo piano shows and the ones with the full band are polar opposites. I would have loved for them to have done a small club show showcasing some of those songs. Hopefully, the footage they filmed for the original ""Little Earthquakes"" video will be released fully on DVD. As well as releasing an updated version of ""92-98"" to include the videos from ""Choirgirl"" to ""Scarlet"", in Surround. Tori herself blocked Atlantic from releasing the videos 92-98 on DVD a while back, and hopefully now she's on break, we'll be able to get this in the meantime. And the ""Live in NYC"" benefit show she did."
3,oh well,"this concert dvd has nothing on ""live from new york."" while the selection of songs is wonderful, her improvs exciting, and the goddess herself breathtaking, the final execution and presentation of the show sucks outloud. i dont care what anyone says, the censoring of ""professional widow"" is a CRIME. i dont think the interludes were necessary, the full interview is better, the ""artsy"" blurry, depth of field shots are annoying, and the lighting scheme that renders tori's skin blue and purple is so unflattering. the dvd is an essential for the obsessed (comme moi) but still, it dont got nothing on ""live from new york."""
4,Finally a live DVD from Tori!,"I think I was so excited about having a live DVD that I didn't realize at first what a shame it is this DVD only includes footage from the last show of the 2002 Scarlet's Walk tour...it would have been nice to have cuts from older shows (even just as extras on the DVD) considering Tori's been touring for nearly 20 years now, or even cuts from other shows on that same tour.All whining aside, this DVD is actually really nice...the interviews with Tori as well as her parents, then the footage of her with her daughter are great. The show itself is really good too, a couple of highlights for me being ""Father Lucipher"", ""Concertina"" and the improvs for which she is so well known.My only really big annoyance with this DVD is Tori's choice to censor so it wouldn't be slapped with a ""parental advisory"" sticker...somehow ""Professional Widow"" just doesn't have the same vibe when it ends with ""Give me peace, love, and a hard BLANK""..."
4,pretty good!,"This is a concert DVD of Tori's last performance on the Scarlet Walk tour, only it is not the full show. Her voice is not as great as it could be because it IS the last show of a two year tour. Footage of fans is a mix between disturbing and funny--some are nuts and others are really genuine in their Tori love. The show itself has some of the best versions of performances. She has a lot of energy as a performer that does and doesn't translate on film. Still, the behind the scenes stuff is funny, and her interview with her mother is adorable. Also, the bonus EP that comes with the dvd is worth buying the whole dvd for! Scarlet's Hidden Treasures are just that! Apollo's Frock, Seaside and Tombigbee are incredible. Even if you're just Tori-curious, I would say go ahead and get this. ;)"
2,Beneath Tori,"Besides the fact that this film looks like its been edited with a meat cleaver, you also get the insult of having the song Professional Widow censored for cuss words. Not only does this destroy the chorus and the climax of a normally brilliant song, but it drags Tori down to the level a street thug ghetto rapper. Its unforgivable and totally incomprehensible. If you can release a CD with naughty words, you oughtta be able to back it up on video. The rest of the DVD is okay, despite the horribly drawn massacre they make out of Crucify, and I think Take To The Sky is the highlight of the show, but I'm still so angry about Professional Widow that I refuse to ever watch this DVD again.The extra songs on the bonus disc make it barely worth the purchase, tho."
5,"""But this is cooling faster than i can...""","Welcome to sunny florida is so brilliant. this is my favorite concert coming in second to Madonna's drowned world tour DVD concert. Her renditions of Cooling, Bells for Her, Sugar, Amber Waves, and Hey Jupiter are so beautiful and intimate. Her voice is awesome live, i was surprised by how she stretches her voice, just wonderful. in the DVD, there are interviews with her mother and father, and of course tori herself. The songs that didn't make Scarlet's Walk are included in the DVD as well. Song titles:Ruby through the looking glass, Seaside, Bug a Martini, Apollo's Frock, Tombigbee, and the gorgeous Indian Summer. The concert is fabulous, the six bonus songs are breathtaking. Tori is a goddess of word and piano."
4,good concert DVD,"I've only been a Tori Amos fan for a short while, so I don't profess to be much of an expert on her music. However, I can say with certainty that this concert is a very good one. The quality level of her performance is outstanding, with particular highlights being ""Your Cloud,"" ""Sugar,"" ""Cornflake Girl,"" and ""Cooling."" The concert is beautifully shot, and not at all erratically edited: you get to actually linger on Tori (a good thing, too, because not only is she gorgeous, she's a dynamic stage presence), which is not always the case on concert DVDs.Along with the DVD is a six-song CD of never-released songs, which are, I am assuming, songs cut from ""Scarlet's Walk,"" the most recent album of new material Amos has released. All six songs are good, with the best being the first, ""Ruby through the Looking-Glass.""The DVD definately makes me want to see Tori Amos live, and I guess that's about the best thing that can be said about a concert film."
5,Great bookI,"I'm a student so it's really hard for me to find time to read books that aren't required for a class. No time! Anyway, great book, easy to read and compelling ideas. Definitely recommended."
5,The way of things to come...,This book was an eye opener for me and I haven't been able to put it out of my mind. Everyday I try to think of ways to follow the book's recommendations to stop wasting non-renewable resources. A good companion is a book calledThe Logic of Failure: Recognizing and Avoiding Error in Complex Situations.
4,What ever you think about recycling - you're probably wrong!,"A must read for anyone interesting in saving the planet. The author is a bit stuck on himself on what he has done but makes the point that some really hard problems can be solved. Typically we don't think about what it takes to recycle and what is the end product. The author points out that contrary to popular belief, the body and top of an aluminum can are different materials and therefore can not be recycled back into your Coke can. This book will completely change your thinking about recycling."
4,Every student of design should read this book,"I am a graduate student in a school of architecture that talks alot about doing 'sustainable design' and the 'green' architecture that has become a fad of late. This book makes the designer think not about efficiently designing buildings, but efficiently designing MATERIALS to eliminate the dangers that are inherent to the chemistry of almost every modern building product. It was an eye-opening read for me and has changed the way i think about 'sustainable design' and what the true goal of 'green' architecture should be."
5,100% Value Added,"I was prompted to read this book by seeing a video of William McDonough in which he suggests that we all need to consider how to actively create a future for our children rather than passively leave a legacy of a toxic waste dump. The book itself is innovative - being both 100% recycleable and waterproof (so you can safely read it in the bath). The message is clear - ""if we continue as we are there will be no future""; and also that it is possible to design products and processes that are infinitely renewable. ""That is a goal worth striving for!"" I thought. SRD."
2,Bitter Sweet,"I have seem Mr. Mcdonough speak numerous times and found him a thoughtful and engaging orator. I had expectations that this book would deliver a comparable message. For me, it didn't. The concept of cradle to cradle is brilliant. But, too much theory without sufficient support. I'd like to see another book on the subject with real world stats on what has worked - what hasn't."
4,c2c,"if you are interested in green design this is a neat book. but to find out about actual details on materials and processes, you have to just turn to the internet."
3,Futuristic ideas from the past,"Don't let the physical weight and thickness of this book fool you. It is made from a special material that makes it seem much longer than it really is - these dudes practice what they preach! It is a quick read with some inspiring concepts and case studies. It is well written and flows smoothly for a piece of non-fiction. It doesn't get too preachy although they nitpick about concepts that don't necessarily hammer the argument home (we may breathe in some material from products we use). Although it was written over a decade ago the ideas remain exciting and unique. However, it isn't a roadmap to ecofriendly sustainability in manufacturing, but more of an argument for how we could approach some problems differently."
5,A must read,"Every responsible citizen in our country should read this book. First of all, this book is not about politics. This is not about red states or blue states. This is not about liberals and conservatives. Whether you agree with McDonough and Braungart may be open to debate (although personally I am not sure how you can disagree with building a better and safer world). The key is for each of us to put aside preconceived ideas and prejudices and really open our minds to important discussions like this that are going to shape our world. If you believe that the future is all about our kids, then this is a must read."
5,Should be required reading in schools,"Terrific book. Easy to read and the topic is absolutely relevant to the times. This should be required reading in Architectural schools, Engineering schools, Technical schools, Scientific studies and in our middle and high schools for sure but also in any studies done on the environment. The ideas put forth in this book are only the beginning I am sure but I believe they offer the only salvation for our beleaguered Earth. What a pair these two authors make. I look forward to anything they may have to say in the future."
5,Cradle to Cradle Review,"McDonough has done an excellent job outlining the issues of balanced environmentalism, and in so doing stirs the reader to desire reforms in this area. You will find yourself believing it is needed and can be accomplished and our planet and lives will be enriched for having done so. Excellent book!"
5,This is the best book I have bought in ages,"This is the best book I have bought in ages, it is also a wake up call to builders, designers, creators and makers, who are on the forefront of the production revolution that this book serves as a manifesto for."
4,"Technocentric, but good","Great book, but extremely Technocentric and portrays that technology is the answer for everything, which I personally don't agree with. Nevertheless this book has some incredible ideas and case studies, that are nothing short of a beautiful reality. I loved reading it even though it went against some of my own core beliefs, but the authors are very on to it and it is a book of hope and genuine good intention."
1,gave it away,"I bought this book for a book club and I read some of it. It is a very heavy book as the pages are not made of paper but a recycled waterproof material. That is the coolest thing about this book. I found it redundant, boring and the point can be summed up in 2 sentences. I do not recommend."
4,Life changing however not enough information sources,"Loved that book, the only cons to it would be that once it freaks you out it does not tell you what to buy or where to find products that are really healthy ..."
2,Parsons School of Design [ Design Management program ],"If you go to Parsons school of design, majoring in design management and going to be a junior in the fall.you will need this for department seminar 4: sustainability design."
3,"Potential, but mostly fluff, not much substance","This book starts with a great concept. Raises some good questions. Throws out a lot of ""why can't we do this or that"" idealistic appeals. But very little substance to actually do anything with.Some ideas presented are very intriguing and exciting, but you get disappointed when there is not much backup information to follow it up. Other ideas obviously have not been thought through, and seem to have no practical relevance.Being an engineer in the manufacturing business, I was hoping for practical concepts that could actually be applied in real-life manufacturing situations. Although a few are presented, they are few and far between."
5,Cradle to Cradle - paradigm shift,"Finally a book for the next generation of designers who want to get a clue .... better read this carefully ...and if you believe ...it will change your life but more importantly, it will help us all change the planet ... in a good way for once.Be this Book !"
3,Superficial Look at Things,"While certain chapters with specific case studies were interesting, I felt like the book was written for the sake of it, rather than really having something to say. It lacked a core and as a result was not tight and concise like what I had expected the book to share. I also didn't feel like it gave the reader any idea of 'remaking the way we make things'... only superficially raising points of what isn't sustainable and ecological, with case studies as illustrations. So, where do we go from here? It doesn't tell us."
3,A few reservations...,"While I agree with the basic premise of rethinking the way we make things, I take real exception to the constant bashing of previous efforts to reduce our negative impact on the earth, from recycling to hybrid cars. Like it or not, most of the ideas set forth in this book are not a reality today, or they exist on such a small scale as to be insignificant in stemming the overall decline. I think we need to embrace all approaches that set us on a path toward where we need to go, and realize interim steps may not be perfect, but they are better than waiting and doing nothing. Hybrid cars are here today. Fuel cell cars are not. You can drive your hybrid car and prevent a lot of carbon from spewing into the air over the next 10 years. Also, I can recycle my paperback book at work or in any city on my way home. Where do I recycle McDonough's highly eco-effective book when I'm done with it?"
2,Brilliant Ideas but...,"I was disappointed with this book. I love the ideas that McDonough and Braungart present. However, I think the ideas could have been just as effectively communicated in a 15-page white paper instead of a 200-page book. For example, the entire book can be summarized with two sentences near the end: ""We can build factories whose products and by-products nourish the ecosystem with biodegradable material and re-circulate technical materials instead of dumping, burning or burying them.""The authors have compelling and original ideas about how to fundamentally redesign industrial processes to be inherently sustainable. Some of the best ideas I have read about how to solve the environmental crisis. However, the authors takes a very long time to make their point. I found a lot of the content to be repetitive."
1,Nothing New,"A tremendous disappointment. The first half of the book recites the same old litany of distortions and half-truths popular with extreme environmentalists. The second half offers promises but disappoints. Don't look here for new ideas that will help with balancing economic growth and the environment. The few ideas are not new. The few examples, though individually good, are surrogates for supporting the environmental agenda of the authors. The authors extol the ant for living an environmentally productive life: Humans, on the other hand, destroy. The authors fail to mention that ants never wrote the Iliad, painted the Sistine Chapel, or composed La Traviata."
4,Pretty good magazine,"I really look forward to this magazine. They have given me lots of ideas for projects to build. The plans that they give you are very easy to follow with nice clear pictures. Some of the projects are kind of lame. And some of the articles they have seem to be repeats, just changed up a little. Overall though I really enjoy looking through it. I just wish it came more often."
1,Very dissapointed,"As an individual who only reads the titles of the magazines I purchase, I was very disapointed in the content of this magazine. As a bisexual, I feel that there is a bit of false advertising with this title. It's not that the projects therein were bad, but it was not what I was expecting."
4,Jerzy REALLY wanted to climb,"This book is not so much excellent because of expert wordsmithing, but because of the content. Kukuczka wanted to climb in the Himalaya so badly, he'd do anything to get there. And he was one of the best ever on difficult, high altitude routes. This book is required reading for mountaineers, armchair and back country."
2,Disappointed...,"Like other reviewers, I found it surprising that The Knot put out such an incomplete book. After reading through this, as well as countless websites regarding weddings (including The Knot), I became overwhelmed by the debate over all things wedding, and decided on a destination wedding. FYI-This book does not even mention the type of wedding that I decided on, so if you are skipping the traditional, this book is not for you. You'll be better of purchasing a blank notebook or regular weekly planner..."
4,Ultimate wedding planner,"This has great advice and tips on what to do, what's needed, how to budget and so on. I really liked it but it didn't have a place to put all my contracts and paperwork for each vendor. I would have maybe liked it better if it was in worksheet form in a binder."
4,The Knot Wedding Planner,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister to help her plan her wedding and from what she tells me, it is a big help and she carries it around everywhere. Great product, I wish I knew about it in time for my wedding."
3,a toss up.,"I didn't think that this book was good for me b/c i wanted a lot of details and specifics that this book didn't have. My mom loves it because she is dealing more with the pricing, budgeting, and finalizations. There isn't a whole lot of room for analyzing options, but the Knot:Weddings in the Real World is fantastic. I have broken the binding on that one. To compare all your options and get a list of specific questions to ask vendors i recommend the planner called ""Easy Wedding Planning Plus."" It is very to the point and has lots of grids for comparison.The Knot Wedding Planner may not be the best choice for someone who is exploring all the options possible, both traditional and non-traditional."
1,Leave it...,"In my opinion, it isn't worth paying for this book--all the same information is available, for free, at wedding websites. I bought a ton of wedding books--and never used them becaue I had all I needed online for free. If you aren't a computer-y person, then go for it...but if you know how to browse websites, save your money for the centerpieces, photography, or other wedding detail.Additionally, if you want to purchase a wedding organizer (really, all you need is an expansion file folder or a 3-ring binder & folders): DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! You really are going to need: one that lays flat (read: sprial bound or 3-ring bidner style), and one that has pockets for reciepts, swatches, contracts, etc. I found that since this had none of these--I used it once, and refused to lug it around with me."
3,Probably not necessary,"I agree with the review that stated that all of this information is already available on their website. If you prefer it in book format, this guide would probably work for you. It's also pretty much a rehash of The Knot Guide to Weddings in the Real World, so I wouldn't recommend buying both, as I did. It's useful as a stand-alone planner, but if you have the Knot Guide and/or use the website, it's redundant. I rarely open mine anymore."
2,Just read the website,"For free you can go to theknot.com and get all the same information and much, much more!"
5,Great Gift,I bought this book for a friend that was having a hard time planning her wedding. She was very grateful and wanted to fill it out the minute she received it.
4,Great Book,"I recieved this book as a gift from a friend and I think its great. Its not a very long book, but helpful in the way that it gives the engaged couple worksheets, helpful pictures for floral arrangements, and other important information to help the bride and groom make their decision.I thought this was a great book"
5,Evervything you need to know about weddings,Very helpful! Spells everything out for you clearly in black&white and helps you organize tremendously!
2,Do KNOT bother,"I suppose the book is straight forward, and such.It has a clean ""style"" to it-- probably because it contains NO useful information inside.I only bought this book because I am really impressed with theknot.com, so I assumed they'd have a fabulous book too. WRONG. Skip this book."
4,Helpful & Concise,"I was expecting the book to be larger, since it had so much in it. At first I was disappointed, but it is actually a nice size to carry around. I have been told that the same information can be found on the website, but I like having it in hardcopy right in front of me. It covers everything, but I wish it went into just a little more detail."
2,Wasn't impressed at all,"If you don't have online access, then this could be a good resource for you. However, most of the information in this book can be found online at sites like theknot, weddingchannel and ultimatewedding. I was hoping for some new information and insight, but this just seemed like a recycled version of their online website."
2,There are better planners,I bought this book and then immediately returned it. It's just not worth the money to have a book with no color pictures and worksheets that are difficult to actually use without destroying the book itself. You can find the same information in bridal magazines and on the internet which can save you money.
3,Not Bad as a Checklist or for Fast Quick Reference,"Not bad if you are just looking for something that will guide you through the planning process and check things off as you do it. It's also good so that you can keep all names and phone numbers in one place. However, I ended up going out and buying a 10 pocket divided folder to just start putting all paperwork in one place (believe me you will acquire tons of paperwork while planning a wedding). But this one is nice if you want fast quick reference and something that you can easily carry with you."
2,"Okay organizer, bad advice","The organizing information is good, but whatever you do, ignore the etiquette advice! Most of it is wrong wrong wrong and you will be branded as ignorant, selfish and greedy if you follow it.Also double check dress standards in your own area... what she says is okay is not going to be so in most places.But as an organizer, it's good. Still, you could spend less money and get a more efficient organizer if that's all you're after."
4,Good book for staying organized,"This is a great book with plenty of information and worksheets/ lists to help you stay on top of planning. I appreciate the guidelines they put in the book, I disagree with just a couple points they make though. For instance, they say never have a cash bar, whereas I know as a guest I appreciated a cash bar more than nothing or beer/wine only. This still keeps you right on track with questions to ask vendors and timelines."
1,Out of Date Advise,"This books advise, tips, worksheets, checklists and frequently asked questions seemed out of date. In these hard economic times the wedding world has change to meet more brides needs, this book contains advise from the past.Check out this just published wedding planning book for Busy Brides today.The Busy Brides Bible for Planning a Fabulous Wedding Without the Expensive Cost of a Wedding Planner"
2,The Knot Ultimate Wedding Planner,"I returned it as it was more confusing than helpful. I got it for my soon to be daughter in law. It was supposed to answer all the questions and did not even answer the basic ones, such as who is supposed to normally pay for what!I am still waiting for my credit."
2,not satisfied,The content of the book was fine but the quality was very poor. When I recieved the book one of the rivets that held the 3 ring binder in was broken......There was a gouge in the front cover.......My daughter went to exchange the book and found that there were none that weren't broken or marred in some way.......since she liked the style and content she exchanged it for a Martha Stewart book that was similar.
1,item never received,"I can't review what I never received. It may be a great book , I guess I'll never know. it was a waste of money since I was charged for it."
1,Buyers Beware! Theknot.com has No Communications and NO Customer Service,"Theknot.com may have useful tools for our weddings, but buyers beware! I bought sale items from them that they never shipped, and never told me that they were canceled!I had to rush to find disposable cameras with less than 20 days left before my wedding. I never got an updated invoice from them, and when I asked, they sent me a dollar amount in my email that wasn't the same as what they charged me - and still no invoice! The response by customer service was ""oh yeah, we canceled the item, and we don't send a notice. thanks!""TheKnot.com is the only vendor I've worked with that actually stressed me out, and for what they are supposed to be, I'm terribly disappointed. I copy/pasted their checklist into a word document, and my Budget Planner is Excel. If they can't get my invoice correct, why would I want them to work out my budget???"
5,Very enGROSSing,"I bought this book along with the companion ""Grossology and You"". I didn't have to remind my 10-year-old son to do his nightly reading for weeks! The subjects are all things that boys find oddly entertaining, ie., snot, fatulence, diarrhea, etc. Each article has the facts of how and why these natural processes occur along with more ""colorful"" excerpts (ie., the diarrhea song) that kids love. This is a great way to entice young boys to get interested in biology and reading. After my son finished reading the book, he pointed out the others in the series and asked if I would get them as well."
5,Make science fun!,"Who says science has to be boring? Our kids (7, 6, 4) are about the ideal ages (better for the 7 year old than the 4 year old though). Our daughter enjoyed it as much as our sons - don't think it is just for boys. Kids have an odd fascination with all of the topics in the book (e.g., snot). The grossness draws them in, and the text is engaging so that they actually learn something while having fun. Recommended."
4,Funny and educational,"Young children should enjoy this. I found it to be a great way to encourage reading in general, but also to teach my children that they can learn through entertainment. I would recommend this to anyone trying to help young readers have a few laughs as they learn."
3,Little disappointed,"I realize this item is ""used"" but from the description I thought perhaps some pages were bent, etc. Not that it was missing the most important part...the fake puke on the front cover---which is a bummer when you use the book as a visual when teaching Grossology."
3,GROSSology.,"This guide is very informative and very funny in parts. It takes everything from poop to speew to toe jam, but its based on a knowlage is power concept and I say in some cases ignorents is bliss. For example if I want to pick my nose. I want to do that without knowing about the grems that all came with it. Thats why I only went through this book once. If I ever get piles or the flew bug I will turn to its graphic advice."
4,Great for organizing your small things!!!,I'm using these bins in my bathroom on one of the shelves. They're great; i just wish they were a little bigger. I guess I should have paid more attention to the size. :)
1,only sent one Shackle,I called belltech 4 times only to be transfered to 3 differnt peoples voice mail . Have yet to hear from anyone .
1,Only for beginners,"This book is primary for beginners. So read this carefully before you buying it.Book Description Tom Swan's GNU C++ for Linux is for beginning and knowledgeable C++ programmers who want to learn programming for Linux using the GNU C++ compiler system. Focusing on C++ fundamentals and object-oriented programming techniques, and including a hands-on guide to X programming, this book provides a complete programmer's guide to GN C++ for Linux, covering such topics as:* Linux and GNU C++ installation * Compiling and linking * Warnings and errors * Modular programming methods * C++ programming.To tell the truth, if you want to master the c++. This is not the book. I should have read the book description more carefully before buying this book."
1,"Do not buy this from ""Global Phone Co."" NOT A REAL COMPANY!","If you order this, it comes from Global Phone Company. They sent me one that the package had been torn open, the item had obviously been used and damaged. When I called the ""company"" I talked to 2 people and I could hear DOGS BARKING IN THE BACKGROUND the whole time! They accused me of damaging the unit myself! Wanted me to ship it back at my own expense.I DO want to buy this product but WON'T BUY IF FROM THIS COMPANY! I don't think Global Phone Company is a REAL business. DON'T TRUST THEM!"
2,Mechanical un-reliable.,"Just bought new today at local store. Compact, light, reasonable price, ... It works ... but ...Test the first time: The spring pin is sticky (dc positive node) fail to spring back to original position when removing the inverter out of car socket.Test the second, third time: Even with the spring pin stuck (loosing spring property), electrical function is still working fine.Intend to exchange. Hopefully mechanical defect gone."
2,No as pictured,This pack is shown as a 3100 cubic inch pack but when I recieved it it was only a 2300 cubic inch pack. It looks the same as pictured on the listing but it is only 2300 cubic inches and very small.
4,Excellent Value,"Attractive watch that is very inexpensive, but looks like more. The two-tone band adds much to the overall visual style of the watch. Adjusting the band was the only disappointment. There should be better documentation on how to do it. The suggestion of taking it to a jeweler detracts from the overall economy of this purchase, but it is still a good value for the price."
3,Silk gloves,"Alas, the medium gloves were small in size. They fitted my wife quite nicely - but only after both had run while being tried on my medium hand."
2,"warm enough, not really silk","be forewarned, what these people call ""China Silk"" is not silk at all but woven nylon of some sort. It's warm enough, but if you are looking for natural fabric, keep looking."
5,Too Wise to Want to be Young Again,"It's been several years since I read Too Wise to Want to Be Young Again by Natasha Josefowitz, Ph.D. so I started thumbing through it and ended up reading it again. The book doesn't take long to read but it is jammed pack with lovely thoughts and inspiration about aging. Dr. Josefowitz uses humor and insight to show us that aging gracefully isn't something to fear but to embrace with gusto. Our wrinkles and saggy skin are badges of honor and now is the time to enjoy the fruits of our labors--including that extra bowl of ice cream! After reading this, you will decide that growing older isn't so bad afterall."
1,a waste of my time,"While I enjoy the genre, I do wish some plot development was possible. Additionally, does the cover really need to be so obvious to all?"
1,Not Subtitled,"While the quality of the movie is about what one could expect from a film of that era without having had careful archival processes, the key problem for non-Chinese speaking audiences was that the movie is not subtitled. The main menu offers three choices - as far as I can tell - play movie, return, and scene selection. Nothing that one can select gives you the option of language or subtitle, let alone other settings. Having read a previous review that talked specifically about the subtitles, I had selected this for a film class but then had to switch it out. I suspect that Amazon may have gotten the wrong batch and did not know about it. The film is supposed to be one of the more interesting ones from the era (some of which was actually filmed prior to the revolution and subject to GMD censorship). But non-Chinese speakers should beware that they will not be able to understand the film."
4,Good music.....but?,"This CD is excellently produced and performed. The quality is top-notch, however, don't expect authentic celtic music. This CD is clearly a product of Nashville. It's good for what it is but I wish they would have marketed it more accurately."
4,Very helpful material.,"This was a very helpful and well written study guide for the latest Linux+ exam. I took the test and passed, although I wouldn't make this the only study material unless you are already very proficient at Linux CLI. I have about 2 years of informal Linux experience so I also used a UCertify test kit to help me study beyond this book. Overall, highly recommend as part of your preparation program."
5,Good book for the Linux+ Exam,"This book is well-written. I did not have a problem reading this book since I had some UNIX (HP-UX and Sun Solaris) background. Topics are clearly explained and easy to understand. Chapter 9 on ""Boot Loaders"" was a huge help for me. In chapter 9 the author covers well dual booting with windows and Linux.My only complain about the book is its lack of a comprehensive final exam. The author could have made an effort to provide at least one final exam. To take advantage of this book I do recommend to install a version of Fedora Core or Red Hat AS/EL. Overall I recommend the book and I give 5 stars"
3,"Not quite par, but it will help...","Truthfully, I found this book to be a little bit... off... It has good information in it, but many of the review questions were a bit obscure... I would buy this book for the content only. Make sure you have another prep book like the Sybex book to contrast with before you go test..."
3,A little ridiculous,"I think that this might quite possibly be the most poorly edited book I've read in years. I am uncertain if the authors lack experience with the English language, but the constant and ongoing syntax errors and general sense of carelessness exhibited throughout this book would make it appear so. I could deal with the aforementioned problems, but the entire book is written in the literary equivalent of a drone. I would highly recommend spending $26.39 on any other study guide."
3,I had higher expectations,"I am a fan of Dana Brown - no question. Loved Step Into Liquid and Dust to Glory as well as Endless Summer II.I also was on the North Shore in December, 2005, when this was filmed.Maybe my anticipation had my expectations too high, but for me, it wasn't as good a documentary as Step. The movie didn't flow (bad pun) as well - it was as if it was forced together.Am I glad I own it - yes, will I watch it again before watching Step Into Liquid - probably not."
4,Very Good Documentary of Surfing,"Not in the class of ""Bustin Down the Door"" but still, a very good documentary of surf competition on the North Shore of Hawaii. Actually, it's not as much about a surf competition, although it does close with a few, it's really about the vibe of surfing and the North Shore. I was fortunate to spend time at the North Shore this year and it's a mystical place to this former low level surfer. Unfortunately, I've yet to be there on a big break day.If you have interest in surfing or Hawaii, you'll like this film. Not as good or as exciting as other surf documentaries, it does still further the story. Of particular interest will be the accidental death of a member of the surf tribe and the story of the very young future surfer."
4,"Solid, I love oahu","This is a good film for any surfer that appreciates the roots and history of surfing just live endless summer movies and step into liquid...also if you have a deep love for Oahu, I tear up sometimes watching it good tunes that you will have in your head during a good session or next trip to the island"
2,kind of boring,"My son is an aviation enthusiast. I bought this book along with some other aviation books. This one however is NOT for children as it has some minor cursing and a chapter on Sexcapades. Fortunately, my nine year old let me know. My bad, I guess we, parents have to preview EVERYTHING!!! After that, I read some of the book and found it quite boring."
1,Rainy day read,Interesting but only in a very limited way. All the subject matter has been covered elsewhere.
4,product worked as stated,I used this to run a com link for a touchscreen in a demo police car at my old company. this was a very cost effective way of getting the demo to work and I was pleased.
3,This can't be Renaissance,"I was really not that impressed with this album from a sound system who usually produces such great street mixed tapes. For a debute on the market, this album was surprisingly disappointing. I have better tapes from Renaissance that I bought from the streets of NY for $5-$10 than this one that I spent $14 on. CD#1 makes no sense to me at all as it its existence. CD#2 starts off really good and then takes a plunge. If you are a real West Indian, especially a yardie like myself... there is no way you can justify more than 3 stars... if even that much.My advise: go to NY and buy their street versions... much more for your money."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Maybe I received a copycat version somehow but these do not work. I must have extremely high arches because there is no support whatsoever, I wont return them because a $5 shipping charge for a $12 item is just not worth it, what a waste."
2,Not right for my feet...,"...but your feet are shaped differently than my feet. I have high arches, and often experience arch pain during long walks or while running. These inserts only exacerbated my foot pain. They are the first inserts I've tried, so I can't compare them to anything else."
5,Very good but I should have sized down,"These have excellent arch support however, I am a women's 8 1/2 so I ordered 9 and after cutting them down the arch is not in the right place so I recommend sizing down."
4,"Decent support, comfortable fit","I have tried many different arch supports, both through Amazon and through local stores. I thought these would be a good combination of support and comfort at a reasonable price. My thoughts were correct, they are comfortable and offer moderate support. Compared to some other insoles though, the support is a little lacking for my flat feet. The material is comfortable and they fit my shoes well. Unlike other arch supports with higher arches, these do not require taking the insoles out of your shoes to make them fit. I am curious to see how well these hold up over time. I will be sure to update my review as time goes on."
1,Arch much too close to heel,"I do not know how anyone could use these. The arch is so far back that half of my heel sits on the arch support, and my actual arch is unsupported. I am a male with a regular build and normal arches. I am returning these right away!"
2,Like the Princess and the Pea,"These may work for some feet but they did not work for mine. The ""arch support"" was like the princess and the pea. A foam pad with a large rubber pea stuck underneath where the arch would be. Did not feel too bad in the morning just starting out but within an hour of standing I had to take them out. I had expected more comfort when I ordered these since I already have a 3/4 pair of SPENCO's that work very well. But they are made with a hard molded shell under the foam pad that contour nicely to my arch. These are made totally of the foam padding. Needless to say I will not be ordering arch supports online without an exact item number that I know is what I want. They come ample sized and had to be trimmed to fit in my shoe (women size 9.5)."
2,Bad arch support,"These are not for flat feet, the Arch support is with minimal support and will not prevent the Rotation of the knees"
5,"Great Price, Really Work","I've had shin splints and tender knees having played volleyball in college and basketball a few times a week, as well as after working out. I ordered these and my shin splints were gone IMMEDIATELY. I worked out with them the next day and had no pain and have had none since.It took a week for the muscles on the outside of my shin bones to strengthen, and they were sore for a few days, but now that I am used to them I will have them for life."
5,Excellent Insoles !,Fast shipping and a great price. The extra support for my arch from these insoles is awesome. After trying every brand on the market I have used Spenco for 10 years. They also add a good general cushion and last for several years.
3,Bought the wrong item.,"The Spenco Arch ""Cushions"" are alright. Unfortunately, I bought the wrong item. I wanted the Arch ""Supports."" Oh well. These provide a lot of arch support. More support, in fact, than Dr Scholls Arch ""Supports"". I wore the ""Cusions"" till the proper ""Supports"" showed up. They're comfortable, durable, and have an anti-microbial bit that keeps your shoe from smelling bad."
4,Great added support,They fit comfortably and provide a great cushion in my shoes that is lacking without added support in most shoes.
3,Immature and Overdone,"Looky everyone! It's another book about teen sex! Wow! There's a clever idea!Well, of the PUSH series, this is the only one that had me genuinely interested throughout, but like Cut, Pure Sunshine and Kerosene, it is not inspirational enough to help anyone in a bad relationship. It's about a girl befriended by a Coma (goth, to you and me) who gets vengeance on a cheatin' boyfriend and a jerk of a best friend. It's a power-trip nothingness not really worth your time. Check out Gossip Girl if books about relationships gone bad are your interest."
1,Not so good,"I have really enjoyed all the of the PUSH line so far. However, I thought this book was seriously lacking. It was mildly entertaining, but I just couldn't get over how badly it was written. Girls in junior high/high school could probably write something better themselves. At first, I thought it was just a matter of an odd style choice on the part of the author, but in the end I felt it was disjointed and amatuerish. The point of view was sloppy; it was distracting and kept me at a constant distance from the characters (all of them). Also, I felt like the humor was forced and usually failed. I can't recommend it when there are so many other well written books out there."
2,Could be better,"Though I Love kristen kemp, and most of her novels, this wasn't as could as I expected, and I was a little disapointed. I do have to agree with one of the reveiwers about this book, it was pretty sloppily written, and was extremely short- for a teen novel. The summary said that the main character did many revenge schemes, but she only did one big one, and it took till the end of the book for her to get there! It was also a little uncomfortable to read as well. I think Kristen Kemp is a great author with talents to make peaople laugh and she writes phenominaly, but this book wasn't one of her best. I recomend- ""The Dating Diaries"" by Kristen Kemp, it is funny, longer, not sloppy and is a real page turner- I loved it, and I think its much much much better than I will survive- wich was very sloppy- sorry Kristen Kemp!"
3,Okay,"Ellen thinks that her life is perfect. She has a sexy boyfriend (Jack), two great best friends (Melisha and Julian), and she's passing English. But Ellen's life is turned upside down when she finds out that Jack is cheating on her with Melisha, her ex-best friend (Julian) is dating her vicious younger sister (Eve), and her mom is having an affair. Soon with the help of her new found friend (Meg, a Goth), she goes on a revenge trip to make her feel better and hurt all the people whom hurt her.I thought that this was an okay 1st novel. I did feel that it was lacking, and sometimes slow moving at times. I recommend this to any girl in high school."
2,Survive-Kristen Kemp,"This book had major potential, but was lacking some nessecary qualities! It was sloppily written, and the point of view was really obscure. One minute it would be all about Ellen, and the next it would switch to another character with no warning! I did think it was mildly entertaining, but I finished it in a couple of hours. I was disappointed by this, I think it could have gone a lot further! If you enjoy teenage angst novels (such as this) with a little more depth, then Life is Funny, Speak or Sloppy Firsts (and its companion Second Helpings) are books that I would suggest instead of this."
2,i have had 3 lacie external hard drives fail on me,i have had 3 lacie external hard drives fail on me. i use them about a year and then they die.
1,Makes my OS Crash,"I have a Macbook with a 2 GHz Intel Core Duo processor and 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM running OS X Leopard. I bought this drive (not from Amazon) last night. After taking it home, unpacking it and starting it up according to the instructions provided by LaCie, I plugged it into my computer's Firewire 400 port. A few seconds later my entire Operating System crashed, and I had to restart. I tried a second time with the same result. I also tried using the USB 2.0 cable and port but it made no difference. I had to return the drive this morning."
5,LaCie Getting a Bum Rap,"Not sure about these reviews. I've had the LaCie for over 2 years now without a problem. Wondering if these people are beating them to death or something. It works fantastic with multiple differenct ports depending on what I want for speed, or just my mood! Auto turn on is great. Actually, I think I know THE problem ...... the bad reviews are using pc's ...... these work GREAT on the MAC ...... the REAL computer!"
3,Good external drive but doesn't play well with Macdrive,This drive is a high-quality one but I couldn't use it as intended becuase it wouldn't play with macdrive or the protools 7.4 branded version of macdrive for windows. could have been my setup though.
3,song in trailer,"after i swa the movie, i got the soundtrack and it was cool but my fave song in the movie wasnt in there! It was useed in one of the trailers where it was all ''the newcomer'' and stuff it was the song playing when julia stiles first went to steps and was dancing really bad for the first time with derick while derricks friend M-kai was getting in a fight with a guy. ..."
5,Better than most soundtracks,"Rather than have no-name artists with forgettable songs or raps, this soundtrack has jams heard on the radio, that you cannot hope to find the single to.Moreover, the songs capture the feel of the film...Go get it..."
4,Not Bad.,"This is a good soundtrack. There are hits (Get it On Tonite, All or Nothing, Murder She Wrote, Breathe & Stop, Bonafide, etc.), and there are misses (You Make Me Sick, Move It Slow), but there is one song that sticks out. Soulbone's ""My Window"" is by far the most beautiful song of all time. I don't know who he is, but this song eclipses every other song on the soundtrack. It's slow & mellow with lyrics that have meaning. I wish he would put out a CD or something, because this song is head & shoulder's above the rest of the CD.Top 5 Songs:5. All or Nothing4. Only You3. Get It On Tonite2. U Know What's Up1. My WindowAll in all, it's a good soundtrack to pick up."
3,i wanna find out the name of a song,i wanna know the name of the song when sara goes to the club the first time when it goes throw ur hands up or something cause i havent been able to find the name of it email me if u know what song it is younf_buck229@hotmail.com thanks
5,Please help with song name,"Hello, please help me to find song which is not at the cd. When black boy and white girl was on the dance floor (in the club) there was the song (first was MethodMan And Redman - Da Rockwilder ) and after that song there was second cool song. Please can anyone tell me artist and the song name of that song."
5,Off the HoOk!,This CD is slammin~ just like the movie! and the songs are great for dancing! this CD is one of my favorites and i consider it a MUST BUY!
3,surprising,"when i bought the soundtrack i was sort of expecting it to be a little bit more upbeat and hardcore rap, but it has it's own fair share of slow r&b jams, which i don't generally prefer, so i found it dissapointing. if you're into slow r&b music, pick it up, it's recomended, if you're looking for something a little bit more upbeat, buy the source."
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"First of all, the movie is SO good. It's not a ""teeny-bopper"" movie, it's a movie that involves teens, racial issues, and some awesome dancing with great music, which makes the soundtrack awesome, too. A lot of the songs are upbeat and great for dancing such as ""All or Nothing"" by Athena Cage, ""You"" by Lucy Pearl featuring Snoop and Q-tip, Ice Cube ""You Can Do It"", ""Bonafide"" X-2-C, ""Breath and Stop"" Q-tip, and ""You Make Me Sick"" by Pink. A few of the songs are slow, like Kci & Jojo's ""Crazy"" The theme from the movie by Fredro Starr is awesome, too! Another good thing about this soundtrack is that all the tracks aren't already playing all the time on the radio, so you won't get sick of it because you already know all the songs. It's a great movie and a great soundtrack. I recomend that everyone go see the movie and then buy the soundtrack. It's definately worth your time and money."
5,Save room on your shelf for Save The Last Dance!,"I love every single song on this soundtrack! I love the movie too! They are all cool, and it's not ""pop"" like... it has more reggae and rap and stuff."
5,This is hip hop!!!,"I really think you should get this cd if you are into hip-hop music! Besides, it's the soundtrack of one of the best films i've seen lately. Go to check it out for yourself!"
3,This isn't the original song sung by Q. Lazzarus in Silence,"For all of you on the search for the Original ""Goodbye Horses"" sung by Q. Lazzarus.. this cd offers you some good news and some bad news.. The good news is this version is pretty damn close to the original.. and this is an all around good compilation.. The bad news is that this is as close as your going to get.. you can only find the original Q. Lazzarus recording on the Married to the Mob soundtrack.. which is out of print. I say go for this cd to hold you over until someone puts out the original again..."
2,Goodbye Horses,"For all of you out there who are looking for the original sung by Q Lazzarus go to musiccity.com, that's where I found it. On this album it is sung by Psyche. The only other album you can get it is the Married to the Mob soundtrack, but that's out of print."
5,Expert practical advice,"As a Career Coach for women, I can't say enough good things about this book! Ms. Hayman's simple yet elegant approach is wonderful for all women, no matter what age, body type, financial status. This book is recommended reading for all my clients."
3,Advice is outdated,"I bought this book back when it was first published. One of the tips Gale gives is to wear your clothes a size too big. Her theory is that you'll look smaller. If you watch even one episode of What Not To Wear, it's clear that in order to dress your best, your clothes must fit you, even if a tailor has to be involved. A big no-no is baggy clothes that Gale promotes in this book."
5,"Awesome, like talking with a friend who makes you feel great.","I love this book. Gale has written a fun , easy to read book. This book will help you get your stuff together, you will learn about clothing, makeup, jewelry and self confidence. Truly filled with style. I would recommend this book."
2,Not really worth $17.95,"Although I have to admit there were a few useful tips, the books really not worth the $20 you have to pay for it"
1,Way too cliche'd,"I'm only about 75 pages into this book that I picked up at a yard sale and I think I'm done. I've never seen so many cliche's jammed into so few pages.I think I knew I was done when a reference was made, during what was supposed to be a hot sex scene, to ""Peter's peter"". Ye gads!Oh well. There were some good reads born of the 60's. This is not one of them."
2,Burned taste after sitting,"I went back and forth about which style of coffee maker to get - a traditional one or a one cup machine. After a lot of research, I went with the Hamilton Beach Brewstation and I have regretted my decision. My first cup of coffee is good, but after it sits for an hour or so, it tastes burnt and bitter. I make 4 cups, so I have tried it with and without the 1-4 cup setting, and neither of them seems to hold the coffee well."
1,Not So Hot,"I did not have this coffeemaker more than a month when it started leaking at all the seams. I had to set it on a kitchen towel, and the towel was soaked by the time the coffee was brewed. I finally pitched it."
1,Leaks Leaks Leaks Leaks,"This is the 2nd BrewStation I have owned. The first one began leaking at about 3 months. I dealt with it by placing a towel under it for a few months until the mess was just too much. I loved the press button to dispense feature, so I was trying to deal with it. I bought a 2nd BrewStation just recently and it too has begun to leak. The leak on both machines are in the carafe. It is the seam where the 2 plastic pieces meet. Like another reviewer stated this is a weak spot in this design. As much as I love the dispenser and the taste of the coffee, I am going to have to move on. I contacted Hamilton Beach and I can purchase a new carafe on my own dime, but the coffemaker is still NEW. I do not recommend this coffemaker to anyone unless you like to change out the towels underneath every hour or so. Don't leave for work with a relatively full pot or you will be mopping when you get home."
2,More info on leaks,"We have had ours for just a year and it developed the same tank leak that others here have reported. I spent some considerable time trying to figure out what the cause was because the gasket around the bottom heating plate doesn't look that bad. Indeed it is not the gasket; it is the tank itself. There are hairline cracks in the plastic near almost every screw hole where the plate mounts. I have tried a couple of different glue attempts to seal these, but so far without success. The thermal expansion of the metal plate is just going to make this design short-lived. HB is closed for the holidays, so I haven't been able to contact them yet."
2,Creative...Leaking after a few months....,"Cleaning cleaning, still could not get it stop leaking.... may need to replace the rubber/plastic lever..... but nowhere to buy.... fixing to trash it!"
4,Great if you don't need your coffee hot for more than 4 hrs.,"I've had this coffee maker for around two months now and I really like it. I had the Hamilton Beach Stay or Go before with the thermal carafe. The thermal carafe kept my coffee hot for 9+ hours. Didn't know how much I would miss being able to pour warm coffee at any time during the day. I love this coffee maker, but there is no option to turn the auto-off ""off"". So, it only keeps your coffee hot for up to 4 hours. Fine if you take it and go; not fine if you sip all day."
2,"This will leak from, tank","I had this for about 11 months and it is leaking from the tank, It does not leak when it has hot coffe only after it cools down, it leaks at the bottoms seals of the tank .it does brew a good cup of coffee but very poorly constructed for the money it is not worth it"
2,Valve breaks easily,The valve that holds the coffee in the pot is very fragile. I broke it while cleaning it one day.Otherwise I was happy with this product for the short time that it worked. It is more convenient than the normal pot-style coffee makers.
2,Excellent until it broke,"I loved this coffeemaker. I drink a lot of coffee, and it was wonderful until the day the dispenser switch stopped working.I asked for another one for my birthday, and received it as a gift. The same thing happened. I'd say they lasted about 4 months, and I loved them while they did.I moved down in looks/qualities to get one that will hopefully last."
3,Good cofee but it LEAKS,"This thing works great, makes good coffe, keeps it hot. The 2 hour auto off Sucks because it is only 2 hours....come on keep it at 3 at least. Now for the bad part if you do not drink all the coffee and leave it for the day the dang thing leaks all over the place. We thought the first time was just a little woops, well wrong it will do it almost every day and it is not yet 3 months old."
1,Don't Bother,"I received this item on September 12, 2008. It was great until October 21, 2008 when the valve that keeps the brewed coffee inside the maker, which is released so coffee will be dispensed when you press your cup against the lever, gave way and hot coffee poured out everywhere. There is no way humanly possible to get the rubber gasket reseated. I worked relentlessly at it for an nearly an hour (I am not a quitter), but finally had to give it up. It will be too costly and troublesome to send back to manufacturer, so I will just get back out my old tried and true Braun. This is a handsome machine with a great idea, especially convenient dispensing, but some engineer needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
3,Owned this Brewstation 21 Months,"We have owned this Brewstation for 21 months now and have loved it....until this past month. We make coffee on an average of 4 days a week and do NOT clean it after every use; usually stays in until the following morning, then is rinsed. (Hubby thinks it tastes like soap if washed.) We have only used the recommended descaler once. We HAVE tried to use distilled water for brewing as much as possible and have only noticed an occasional leakage of clear water on the counter after brewing, but only a small amount. This past month, our coffee started to taste weak, so changing the brew time, the brand of coffee, nor cleaning with descaler have seemed to help. We believe the water going into the grounds is now not hot enough for proper brewing, so we are looking to replace the coffee maker. My reason for giving it 3 stars is that for the price, it should have lasted much longer than 21 months!"
1,Do not buy this coffee pot,"Dont get me wrong, I loved it, but I have had to replace the holding tank three times because it leaks.( And I had to pay for them to ship it to me. )Not from where the coffee flows out, but the tank itself is seamed. This seam is a weak spot in the design. My third tank I only had it a month and for no apparent reason it leaked. I did not put it in the dishwasher, I did not drop it. Most of them are defective. Until they fix this, dont buy it."
3,Boiling coffee,"I, like many others, researched various coffeemakers before deciding on the Hamilton Beach Brewmaster Deluxe. After running a little vinegar and water through it, the coffee had a great flavor. Our one criticism of the coffeemaker is that the coffee actually simmers in the pot after an hour or so. The coffee gets so hot it scalds. Upon calling customer service we were told they were aware of this problem and told me we needed to bend or dent the one plate on the pot so the two metal plates don't sit flush with one another. This is their solution? Really? Since I don't have the box to return it, I'm stuck with it for now. I will be on the look out for a replacement."
1,Booooooo,"As many others have reported .... loved the concept of this machine, the ease-of-use, the convenience, the coffee, etc., but as others have reported, mine started leaking from the top tank into the bottom, onto the counter, then onto the floor. And as previously reported, only once the coffee has cooled down, not when hot and in use. So, it's usually after you leave home, then come home to stained counters and floors. Loved it, but won't buy another, since this is obviously a design flaw, and Hamilton Beach was less than helpful :( ."
4,Pleased,"Love the 4 hour ""keep hot"" function. Ideal when everyone leaves the house at a different time. Had the earlier model and it lasted 6 years of daily use. Good product."
3,Nice,The product is sufficient. I like the timer and the fact that it does not have a carafe. The coffee that it makes is ok tasting.
1,What a mistake!,"I bought this machine for the convenience of not having to deal with leaky, drippy carafes.It arrived the day before Thanksgiving. I was so looking forward to using it.When I ran plain water through it for a rinse I found that it leaked. Of course I thought it was a fluke. So I made my first cycle of coffee. When I Got my first cup of coffee I saw that the machine had leaked all over my counter top.I tried over and over again and kept getting the same results. I contacted Hamilton Beach, but all I've gotten is the run around.I'd like to try another brand, but I am fearful.I am not a happy camper."
4,Crossing My fingers,"Love this BrewStation. This is my second one. The first one only lasted about 6 months but I was brewing 3 - 4 pots a day. Unfortunately I didn't have the receipt to return it. So I'm crossing my fingers now to see if this one lasts longer. It brews quickly, efficiently and best of all keeps the coffee HOT."
5,Great for the price.,"For the $60 I paid for it when it was on sale, I don't think I could have gotten better. For this price range the coffee is good and it is much easier to manage since the coffee is internally stored; stays fresher a bit longer too. The feature that lets you time when the coffee is made, is great if you don't have time in the morning and you want your coffee right when you wake up."
4,Hot Coffee,"I picked the Brew Station because I had heard reviews that listed it well up the list. The first Brew Station I received was defective and I was very discouraged because I had high expectations for it. It had brewed really good coffee, so I asked for a replacement. It was a good choice. I brew small amounts and the brew station makes good coffee and keeps it hot."
1,Keep looking,I purchased this Christmas of 2006 and it worked great until just after Christmas of 2007. It survived it's limited one year warranty and then the leaking began. Same problem others have reported. Leaks when coffee is left in the bucket and begins to cool down. We really enjoyed this style maker but the leaking if we neglect to empty the pot before leaving the house in the morning is unacceptable. And this is too expensive a model to have to throw away after just one year. Save your money and go with the black and decker conventional carafe model consumer reports recommends at a fraction of this price.
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!,"Yes, I am extremely disappointed with the quality. Much like another customer said, I had this machine for about a year when it started leaking from the holding tank on top into the bottom tank, then onto the counter. I as the other customer said noticed that it did not leak when the coffee was hot only after it cooled down. Other than the slow brewing process the coffee was very-very good. The concept of the single pour was GREAT but for the pricey cost of the machine and having to toss it into the trash can after only a year ... it just was not worth it and I would not purchase it again."
1,Great Concept BUT poor design,"I have had my brew station for almost a year and I got this unit because my mother-in-law had one and I loved it. Soon after I got mine, hers began to leak coffee from the holder all over the counter. She eventually had to stop using it all together. Well sure enough, just under a years time, mine began to do the samething. While it worked, it was great but it would have been nice to have used it for atleast a few years.**Just another note. I kept very good care of mine. Cleaned it after every singe use and never left coffee in the container.**"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!,"I have had my 12 cup Brewstation for a little over a year. I bought it for the express purpose of getting rid of the glass carafe concept which eventually breaks and requires expensive replacement. Just today the plastic ""bucket"" that receives the brewed coffee began a steady stream of a leak from the coffee bucket valve which resulted in coffee all over the counter! I transferred the coffee to another carafe and tried putting some water into the bucket. Again, a steady stream. This product is a good concept but has NOT been designed for long term durability. There are cheap plastic parts on the release valve of the bucket that cannot be replaced...and I'm not ABOUT to buy a new bucket. Pass up this model, folks, it's a great disappointment in the end."
1,It leaks!!,"Buy a mop along with the BrewStation, because you will be siphoning hot coffee from your linoleum. Do not leave this machine unattended. Do not leave brewed coffee in the receptacle. Keep the unit on the edge of the sink, so you can unplug it and toss the machine into the sink and maybe save your floor. Unbelievably bad engineering. This happens often and unpredictably. I threw mine into the trash."
2,It's okay,At first I really liked this coffeemaker with my only gripe being that some of my tall travel mugs did not fit under the dispenser and that if you pushed too hard the coffeemaker traveled back on the counter top. After 2 years though the dispenser stopped working for no apparent reason. I am going back to a traditional coffeemaker.
4,So far I really like this coffeemaker!,"I have had a Mr. Coffee for years. We don't drink a lot of coffee, so I figured why spend more $$. But recently, I haven't been happy with the taste of the coffee that I was making, so I bought this. Love that there is no carafe! I know 2 other people who have this brand -- different models and they both love it. So far I am very pleased."
4,Deluxe Brewstation Coffeemaker,"The Hamilton Beach Deluxe Brewstation makes an attractive to any countertop. Large display is very easy to readand understand. Different brew settings help make a good cup of coffee. One caution, Remember to rinse the pot between brewings. The metal disc in the the middle of the pot tends to stain and could affect the heat transfer between the element and pot if not kept clean. Overall I'm very happy with the product."
4,Great Coffee Maker,"Very easy to use and a pleasure to ""pour a cup of coffee"". The only problem I have is that it is a little unhandy to fill the base unit with water without spilling some onto the countertop due to the small opening. Overall a very good buy! This is the second BrewStation I have had!"
5,We love it....,"We have used it for more than a month and we love, love it. The coffee stays hot... would buy it again."
4,Hamilton Beach 47454 BrewStation,This is a wonderful product. I liked it so much that I bought 2 more for family members as gifts. They rave over it. If you like Ice Coffee... this is your coffee maker.
3,A little too strong,"I purchased the Hamilton 47454 BrewStation about a month ago. It's easy convenient, and it's great not having a coffee pot to deal with. Although there is a filter I still use filtered water or the coffee taste a little bitter for my taste."
4,Made to stay fresh for hours!,"I am basically very well pleased with this Coffeemaker. I love the lasting freshness, the ""stay hot"" for up to 4 hours feature...and...I have no more problems filling my travel mugs! Great features. The ONLY negative to mention is the unhandy means of filling with water and coffee to ready it for brewing. I truly dislike the back loading for this procedure! Bad feature there. BUT...overall a very good product...the next tweaking should get it just right!"
3,Hamilton Beach 47454 BrewStation Deluxe 12 Cup,I bought this to replace a Bunn that I had for 25+ years. The flavor of the coffee is just not as good as the Bunn. I bought it because of the rating by consumer reports. Currently the Bunn does not have a favorable rating. Too bad that they don't make them like they used to.
4,Best Coffeemaker I've Owned,"Well, six months out, so I've passed the honeymoon period with this coffeemaker...and we're still in love. Don't need to g ointo details since there are so many reviews. It has been great. My one complaint, and it is so very minor, is that while it is tall enough for travel mugs, it isn't tall enough for travel carafes/thermoses. But adjusting the height could make it gargantuan."
4,Decent Cup of Coffee,"Makes a good cup of coffee. Love having no carafe and the temperature is just right, the coffee stays hot without the burnt taste. I find the best grind of coffee to use is a very fine grind,In this way the maker extracts the most flavor possible from the coffee."
4,Great timer feature,I only like this coffee maker for the four hour auto shut off feature. My husband goes to work at 5 a.m. and I get up around 8:30 a.m. I can set the coffee up the night before and make enough for me and him and it's ready when we both wake up. Our old coffee maker shut off after two hours so I didn't have coffee waiting for me when I woke up. On this one I set the shut off timer for four hours and its ready as soon as I get out of bed. Other than that I wouldn't have paid $70 for it. The plastic carafe can't be put in the dishwasher like a glass one can. It has a water filter which in my opinion is useless. It also has symbols that come on when it's time to change the filter and when it's time to clean the coffee maker with a vinegar solution.
4,Brew Station Delux,Very sastified with this coffee maker we make a lot of coffee about 8 pots a day and have brought at least 3 of these makers and family members seen mine and they brought it to.
5,Stands Out Above Similar Priced Machines,"I purchased the BrewStation a few weeks ago and have been very impressed with its performance. The biggest difference is the water temperature - this machine gets the water to near perfect temp while brewing which helps bring out the right flavor of coffee. I really like not having a pot to worry about. The delivery mode, a push button style, is hard to get used to but it works just fine. One improvement would be in how water is introduced as it is clumsy filling up the reservoir and pouring it into the basin. This is a great buy. Next step would be a machine from Starbucks at around $100 or so."
1,Don't purchase,We purchased this coffee pot in December 2006. We thought we had made a great purchase. It had everything we had wanted in a coffee pot. To our dismay after having this product for about 6 months the pot started leaking into the bottom. We e-mailed Hamilton Beach and they promptly sent out a new pot. After 6 more months it started leaking again but this time it was worse! We called them and they told us that this is not under warranty and that from the changes in temp. this would continue to happen. then they offered us the option of purchasing another pot for $12.00. No thank you! I purchased the coffee pot for $100.00 and expect it to last longer than 6 months.
2,Disappointed,"The Hamilton Beach Brewstation leaked in two places the first time I used it. I had one of these coffeemakers for several years until it no longer worked. I had a leaking problem with it as well, and HB replaced the leaking part, and it worked for several years. In reading other reviews, I see that leaking is a common problem with the HB Brewstation. I returned the defective coffeemaker and purchased a Cuisinart dispenser coffeemaker. I am very pleased with it. The return process with Amazon was easy with prompt credit to my account."
2,Was ok when new!,"This is our 3rd Brewstation. This model 47454 lasted less then a year. Was pouring slowly, cleaned it good and now it leaks pass the seal a lot more. oh and this always has leaked. I guess the seals are cheaply made. Also went looking for a new seal for this model lol $7.99 less shipping at HB, for a piece of rubber. Heck HB should throw a few in with the coffee maker. Unless HB has made a new seal for this get ready for some papertowels. Most reviews you read are when the coffee makers are new. Hope this helps"
1,Only lasted a year......,"I got this coffee maker about a year ago and was in love with it. It was used daily, with some days doing 2 brews. Then, like others, the leaking started, big time. For the price of this unit, I was expecting it to last years, with an `s', not year. I was ready to get another one of these, then I started reading the reviews here. That changed my mind. I'm replacing it with the Cuisinart DDC-3000 (a few dollars more), which arrived from Amazon yesterday. The first thing I noticed is the general quality of the unit. This unit is flimsy plastic and the DDC-3000 is a much heavier plastic (of course), and seems to be generally better built. I'll be setting up the new one today, and this Hamilton Beach high priced junk will be in the trash. If you are considering this unit, I strongly recommend you try something else because it will not last!"
2,Misled about specs,"The only good thing about this coffee maker is that it pours easily. It DOES have a carafe and it's not insulated at all, it's just a thin walled plastic jug. And because it's not insulated it DOES have a burner but they just call it a ""gentle warmer"" that's actually labeled ""hot surface."" It's a P.O.S."
2,"Bought two, both failed soon after warranty was up.",I have two of these (purchased within a month of one another). Both are now leaking from carafe/reservoir connection (leaking coffee on the counter). One dispenser tab is also not working so you have to physically pour from the carafe. Cheaply-built product - worked well until it failed but both are just over a year old. Won't make this buying mistake again.
2,"Liked , but disappointed now!!",I have had this brewstation for over one year and now the carafe had cracked (around the screw holes) where the metal piece is screwed into the carafe. The coffee drips back into the water resevoir. No warranty was allowed because it is over one year. They want $24 for a new one plus shipping and sales tax. Everything else about the brewstation was great minus the carafe.
2,"Nice concept, but not very durable","I've owned the Brewstation for several years now. I was happy with it at first, despite a couple minor complaints. I've followed the instructions precisely, which include not putting any of the plastic parts into the dishwasher (one of my minor complaints). Nevertheless, the coffee reservoir has begun leaking. The reservoir consists of several plastic components welded or glued together. Apparently, one of the seams is leaking, and coffee is running down through the lower unit onto the kitchen counter. I ""solved"" the problem by emptying the reservoir as soon as the coffee is done brewing. But that negates the benefit of being able to dispense one cup at a time. Unfortunately, I've given my old coffee maker to charity."
1,No replacement filters,Be careful with your filter. There are absolutely no replacement filters that will fit this model. The filter listed on HB's web site does not fit this model. A call to Hamilton Beach informed us that there are no filters for it at all. Now we have a $70 paperweight.
4,Hamilton Brew Station 47454,"I own both the original and upgraded version. I love this coffee maker. My only complaint is that the new one is a little on the slow side (I am impatient for my coffee!)But I am mostly very satisfied! Also, it looks good."
4,If you like it hot!,"I have owned this coffee maker for a little over a year and loved it. If anything, it brews the coffee a little too hot! It does seem to take a little longer to start brewing, but after that the brew cycle is normal. Unfortunately, I have to buy a new one now. The plastic spring loaded valve broke today. I was disapointed that spring loaded valve that you use to dispense the coffee was not better built. I usually expect two to three years at least out of a coffee maker. That said, I am buying another one. Maybe I have gotten lucky and they improved this problem."
3,47454 Brew Station,"Product was exactly as advertised. Convenience of ""push to fill cup"" is a plus. Filling water is a little awkward, but the filter basket is easy to use and clean (I always use a paper filter). The unit is not very good looking on the counter, and the ""blue eye"" can be disconcerting at night in room not well lighted.It does make a good cup of coffee, which, of couse, is its main purpose in life."
3,A little over a year old and the coffeemaker broke,I loved this Hamilton Beach 47454 Brewstation Deluxe 12-cup coffeemaker until it leaked coffee all over the counter and couldn't be fixed. I am hesitant on ordering another one and am going to switch to the Cuisinart 2600. Prior to my Hamilton Beach I always used percolators. Is the life expectancy of brew stations only about a year?
5,Awesome Coffee Maker,"Best coffee maker I ever owned, Originally bought one from a garage sale and was super impressed. It lasted about a year until the plastic part the allows for dispensing of coffee broke so instead of going cheap I went ahead and bought a new one. Amazon had the best price anywhere and with the free shipping it couldn't be beat. If you are looking for a great coffee maker for under a hundred bucks look no further, this is it!"
1,Hamilton Beach does not stand behind this product.,"I have to admit that this was a good product the first couple of years I had it. It still works fine with one exception: It won't dispense the coffee anymore. There's a little plastic piece that the dispense bar presses against when you dispense coffee. Logic dictates that over time that piece will wear out from repeated usage. However, when the one on mine finally broke I contacted Hamilton Beach to purchase a replacement. Unfortunately that's not a piece that they stock or are able to obtain. So basically I have an expensive paper weight that makes coffee. I wasn't expecting them to replace it for free. I just wanted to purchase the piece and fix it myself.As far as making iced coffee: I found the process to be not worth the bother. I found its easier to just brew a pot of very strong coffee and add ice.If asked 2 months ago I would have highly recommended the BrewStation Deluxe; now I won't buy another Hamilton Beach product."
1,Terrible coffeemaker,I bought this coffeemaker based on the rave reviews and was totally disappointed. The coffee came out luke warm. I took it back to the store immediately and returned to using my Gevalia.
4,updated:2010,"i bought this as a birthday gift for myself last september (2009). loved the look and the idea. it worked fine, but leaked baaaaaad!! i tolerated it for about 2 months, then wrote to hamilton beach. they sent a new reservoir - not an exact replica of the original, but an obviously redesigned one - voila! perfect! works great! now i am free to be in love w/ my coffee-maker again! 4 stars b/c of all those mornings i had to clean the counter... 5-star performance now that problem is solved."
2,Worked well until.....,"It seems like my wife and I have been through coffee makers once a year. Something breaks or the carafe breaks, and then the replacements carafes ""mysteriously"" disappear from the store shelves where we bought up it. Mr. Coffee in particular seems notorious for this. Anyway, this time when I did some research I thought it was a great idea to have a system where there was no carafe. The H-B Brew Station worked well, at least at first. However, when I tried to clean the water, (not the coffee) filter, the one they sent me was for a completely different model. Poor directions were inscribed with pictures imprinted on the side of the coffee/water reservoir. When I tried to remove the filter, which in retrospect, I guess I should not have done, I must have damaged the lever, because now it leaks and is useless. Bad design and even worse instructions. Back to the drawing board again...."
2,Leaky seam,"I was so happy with my new coffee maker. It is beautiful, makes great coffee, really easy to use. IT LEAKS. It is not the dispenser, it is the seam around the bottom of the tank. I called HB and they sent me another one a few months ago and now it has started leaking also. If they would make one with a solid tank design I would get another one. Other than the leak, it is the best coffee maker I have ever had."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED! IT LEAKS!,I am veryyyyyyy disappointed in this machine!I received this Coffee Maker as a Christmas Gift Last year and 10 months later Its leaking!!!When I filled the tank this morning...and poured it into the well..it immediately came pouring all out...thankfully the sink was right there. Seems from the reviews I have read...the leaking is a big big problem..and since I got this as a gift..I do not have a receipt and will probably not be able to resolve the problem with a warranty. I really thought after owning my other HB brew station..(the older version) and I loved it so much..that I would upgrade to the new one!...Incidently I gave my old one to my son and its still going strong after 3 years with no leaks.I really love the brew station...wish other companies would come out with a more reliable version...but for the money..I will NOT be replacing this coffee maker. I will start to look for a thermal carafe instead.
2,"Poor reliability, bad warranty service","This unit made great coffee...for not quite 6 months. Called Hamilton Beach warranty department - to get a replacement you must do the following: Write a snail-mail letter describing the problem, cut off the end of the cord and mail along with a check for $9.95 to their service center. Some warranty...I'm not impressed."
3,"Yes, it does leak!!!","I really thought this was the ultimate coffee machine until mine started to leak. The leak is not coming from the dispenser, but from the bottom seam on the top part of the machine under the handle. Until I decide on my next coffeemaker, I just transfer the coffee to a carafe shortly after brewing. Soooo disappointed!!!!"
1,failed within 3 months,"While this coffee maker has a well designed housing, easy to use, brewed good coffee, and expensive, it failed after 3 months to boil the water in the brewing cycle. HamiltonBeach customer service says it was due to not cleaning the coffee maker at least once a month or more and that some internal plastic tube was clogged from hard water, or something. How could this be? I filter my water and it has its own filter built in. I also cleaned it a couple times. I think there is something else a problem such as a temperature shutoff diode malfunctioning since it occasionally worked from a cold state. The good thing is this coffee maker was still under warranty but they are charging me $12.99 to ship a new one. For those considering to buy this one, I suspect there is a design flaw so there could be a possibility other units will eventually fail. Maybe out of warranty."
1,so disappointed !,"I am a true Hamilton Beach fan & I really liked this brew station, until today. I've only owned this coffee maker 7 mos. & it just stopped brewing ! Had to use my 6 yr. old KitchenAid. I will not buy this again nor will I recomend it to family or friends. As I stated, I am so disappointed."
4,UPDATE TO F.Y.I. Turn On Problem,"I purchased My Hamilton Beach Brew station in February, 2012. This month I began having problems starting the brewing process. I had to turn it on and off repeatedly for it to brew.I called Hamilton Beach and they told me to hold the start button down for 10 seconds to re-program it. So far, so good.I hope that helps some of you.BettyUPDATE! I tried reprogramming like customer service told me and it did NOT work.Now it doesn't work at all!!I tried calling them back but they close at 4:30pm eastern time."
3,"Worked great, for the first year","I've had this for 2 years now, and I loved it, for the first year, and 2/3 of the second year. But now, even after taking it apart, cleaning it all out, running vinegar through it monthly, cleaning the parts with vinegar, the stream of coffee is more like a heavy dripping of coffee. It now takes so long to fill your cup by pushing it against the button that I don't even bother anymore. I now take the basket out, and take the whole container off and use it like a carafe. Now I'm here on Amazon looking for a new coffee maker, one with a carafe.So beware, you may not get good use out of this as long out of this as you had hoped."
1,Leaked onto the counter top during first use...,This item was either defective or of a poor design. It leaked onto my counter top during the first use - BEFORE I even tried to dispense any coffee! I would avoid this model.
5,Excellent Coffee Maker,"Great coffee maker. It hold all the coffee in dispensing carafe, so you can pour coffee when you need it. The coffee tastes great and even has a flavor enhancer. I would definetly recommend this product."
1,Should last longer,I am so disappointed. I read the reviews and thought this should be a great buy. Our office had purchased one and I thought it would be great to have at home. I was wrong. I purchased this in July. It is now January. I have run vinegar through as directed a couple of times in this period but it is not working! I have tried everything. The brewstation is not using all the water. Filling up for 12 cups actually only produces 8 cups of coffee. How disappointing. A coffee pot of this price point should last more than 6 months!
5,Use this every day,"Has held up well. Keeps the coffee extra hot, and easy to dispense. Would be wonderful for anyone who has trouble lifting the coffee pot!"
2,Not what we expected,"We purchased this a year ago, and because it lasted a year, it got 2 stars instead of 1/none. From the beginning, this coffee maker leaks water during the brewing process. We actually exchanged the first one we bought because of this the day after we received it, but this one does it as well. It is a design flaw. The water seeps out from underneath the unit.2nd issue- 2 days ago, the lever behind the button that you press with your mug stopped pushing up the valve above it, making this simply an expensive (and pain in the neck) carafe model. Now we have to remove the top carafe and pour it, completely defeating the purpose of the front dispenser. I will not be purchasing another Hamilton Beach products."
2,Did not last through warranty period,I liked the BrewStation for a while because of the convenience of the dispenser. That's about it. It is very slow brewing in any mode. After using it for 10 months it quit working. Since the warranty requires the consumer to pay for shipping to and from the mfr. it is not worth the effort or cost. It's a throw away item.
1,After the purchase,"I agree that this is a good coffee maker, however, after three months of use, the little flapper control, the one that allows coffee to flow when the push bar pushed, broke rendering the coffee maker useless, no replacement parts to be found, silence from Hamilton Beach....I have contacted Amazon, but my guess is this will also result in silence"
1,"Good for a month, then will break -- happened with 2 units","I purchased this product, and it was great for a month. Then the plastic lever that seals the dispenser broke, causing coffee to run all over the place. Exchanged it for a new one, month later, exact same thing.Hamilton Beach simply gives you a form to order an entire replacement tank on your own dime.What a shame, it's a great concept."
2,"Very conveniant, but leaking!","Sadly I join my voice with others. I bought this unit in Dec 2007 and because of the reviews, I invested in the 2 year warranty. I've noticed the leaking underneath for the past few months, but it's getting so bad that I have the unit sitting on paper towels. Still works great, but before it falls completely apart, I'm using the warranty I paid for."
3,Beware ...it Leaks,I've had this BrewStation coffeemaker for a year. I have had no problems till recently. It started to leak coffee into the lower chambers. My husband took it apart and saw that the gasket was stretched and weakened. I looked for a new part to order but no luck. Seems it should of lasted longer.
3,coffeemaker,"It is convenient not to have a carafe, but the coffee doesn't stay as hot. Coffee is very strong. We cut the measurement of coffee in half."
1,DOES NTO HOLD WATER!,I have had two of thses identical machines one from Amazon and on from another source and they both work fine for a few days and then start pouring out water from the bottom of the machine and will not hold water!What a mess. Hamilton Beach should recall them all!!David Mechals
1,great book,"I give this book 5 stars! It is no longer in print so it cost a bit much but I was pleased to receive it like new condition. I had the book within days. Very happy overal with service. I have bought books in the past and will continue in the future. Hopefully book that is out of stock will be here in time for class.when i previewed it only gave one star...that is incorrect, cannot find star button, want to give it 5!!!"
4,LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES,I loved this book for its overall view of face painting. I found it very helpful in learning and improving my skills. I would recommend this to anyone interested in making original dolls.
5,beautifully illustrated,Another good book by P.M.Culea.Step by step instructions for creating faces. Beautifully illustrated and different techniques discussed.
5,Doll faces explained and made simple to do,"Creative Cloth Doll Faces: Using Paints, Pastels, Fibers, Beading, Collage, and Sculpting TechniquesUsing many photos and easy to follow directions and diagrams, Patti has reduced the terrifying and difficult task many feel unable to acheive to its basics and allows the artist in you to come alive!The book has dolls from a number of different artists and demonstrates each of their approach to making the face come alive! The tips are portable and not limited to just Patti's own dolls, but ones you can save in your head for future use on a new project.I highly recommend this book for both beginning dollmakers as well as for advanced artisans who want to improve their work or techniques."
4,canada rocks,this is anne carson at her best! the promise she showed in plainwater and eros the bittersweet comes alive here in one of the best books from the late 90s!
3,Canada's Got It Goin On,"Her lines don't make sense and the story kinda peeters out at the end, but Anne Carson's knack for the odd and mysterious in everyday life is like no one else's. Read it for the language, if nothing else!"
4,Anne Carson speaks for me in a language I do not possess,"Her words and stories are so poignant that I find myself saying, over and over again, that I could have, myself, written it. . . if only I had the immeasureable skill and talent which she is fortunate enough to have. We can all relate to her lines, in some capacity, in our own lives if we have ever loved anyone or anything - including this glorious language she uses in such a profound and exciting way."
5,Inspiring!,"Whenever I feel a need to revitalize my writing or merely need a good chuckle I turn to ""Autobiography of Red"". No one inspires me as well as she does and no one has the knack of finding just the right verb or adjective to express herself. I want more!"
5,My daughter's favorite,My daughter just received this video for her 2nd birthday and is obsessed with it.
1,"Waste of money, bad DVD","This Jay Jay dvd is fully different from PBS Kids episodes of Jay Jay the Jet Plane. Many episodes have a new character that speaks Spanish all the time. This DVD is great if you speak and understand Spanish. Otherwise, it is a waste of money. I would rather record from my PBS."
3,"Good, but Better","The CD is very good, especially for Roy Orbison fans. The Celtic blend with his music is great. However, in my opinion,only a few of the songs ""cut the mustard."" I wish the majority of the songs could have been as good as ""Dreams.""It is still worth purchasing as I listen to it everyday at work."
4,inside the healers mind,Carla gives us a glimpse in Calico Shaman of that other world and the entities in it that make up the other reality that is so important to understanding the work. Its an enjoyable journey and a fun read. The most amazing thing is it at no time is what you expect.
2,makes no sense,I found this to be a difficult read and never finished the book. it just did not hold my interest.
3,Excellent Book with poor editing,This is one good book on BGP with an error a page.The good point about this book is it uses minimal routers for examples and demos. It also has excellent troubleshooting diagnosing documentation. This book could do better with editing.Just too many mistakes.
3,Another dissapointment for BGP book,"Why does everyone keeps repeating the text in the Cisco web site.There should be a BGP book for the man and not for the boys. There should be a BGP book that tackles more on attributes, filtering, regular expressions, etc. All that is in this book are basics, you can learnb it also from Cisco web site or from the Cisco ATC."
4,Great Book for a resource and working with BGP,I have read it and decided to share my thoughts. Basically it gives you all the BGP commands and how to use them. It's a great resource to learn from or to help with using it in the real world. All the BGP commands and examples you need in one location. A must read for CCIE prep. You can't beat that.
3,"Good Book, Lots of errors","The good thing about this book is that with 2 or three routers you can verify the configurations presented in the book. Then it is easy to see the errors. And there are lots of errors in this book. Most of them are just simple errors that any CCNA could find; example: four loopbacks configured loopback0-3, show ip route: loopback1-4, not big errors, but confusing. Also many times routers are mixed up in the configuration and the show commands. Example: a show command on router A displays information that must be from router C. etc..I like this book very much, but it is getting a little bit unreadable because of the corrections I made :)The strange thing is that there is no errata on the ciscopress site for this book.3 stars because of the errors, otherwise 4,5"
3,Will not work on all hoses.,"After reading the reviews I was looking forward to purchasing this. I use 100 feet of 3/8 inch Gilmour Flexogen hose, so I thought that this reel would work since it is advertised to support up to 125 feet of hose. Unfortunately, it does not work well with my hose. The last 10 feet enters the reel very slowly (if at all), and when I take out the hose, it is a struggle to get the first 10 feet out. My wife can't take out the first few feet of hose as it is usually stuck and rubbing inside. I now have to take this reel back to the store."
5,Hydro Industries Autowind Hose Reel,"One of the greatest products I've ever had. I ordered two of these and I asked if they came in any other color than gray. I said that tan would be nice. I was advised that gray was the only color. When they arrived ""wallah"" they were tan. I'm completely fascinated by them."
2,Are these reviews legit?,These customer reviews sound very slick to me. I am going to look elsewhere for comments on this product.
5,Real insight worth reading,"Take a look at the other reviews listed here and you'll notice a common thread - most are from Hollywood and internet insiders with strong opinions about the movers and shakers leading the merger of traditional content and broadband media. This book touches a nerve because it really does provide insight into the games that were/are played. Clearly, the authors know what they are talking about, and this is a solid read. I highly recommend it."
4,Interesting Read,"I was fortunate enough to work for both Greer and Zakarin so it was very interesting to hear an outsiders take on the people and events.That being said, I do feel that the book could have had more depth. Being there, I can attest to the fact that some of the issues were glossed over and approached in a somewhat naive manner.Despite my critisism I do recommend giving it a read. For those who were not a part of the industry it is an interesting look into this fast paced world and even for those who were part of the industry I think it puts some of the personalities into context.As for the disgruntaled former Asylum employee . . . well like the others have already said, Scott treated people fairly. The fact that your review of the book turned into a personal attack on the people in it probably says a lot about why you have these feelings in the first place."
1,This book paints a completely wrong picture.,"This book paints a completely wrong picture of what actually happened. I was there. I was an employee of Entertainment Asylum. Scott Zakarin and his goons are complete failures in the minds of anyone who really worked along side them. Even still, they have an uncanny way of succeeding through failure.They were only interested in one thing...them. they didn't care for one second about the people who actually worked at EA or anywhere else. All they wanted to do was help promote their careers, even if it meant putting out a shotty product they knew wouldn't work.They're Internet con-artists at best. I have no love loss for them what-so-ever."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"Despite a few good tracks (""Oh My My,"" ""Somethin' I Would Do""), ""Time Is Money"" is a lackluster album. The beats are repetitive, and SPM's flow is so-so at best, and he really doesn't speak on anything new or provocative. You'd be much better off borrowing and dubbing this album from someone who bought it off the rack."
4,Bourdain *** UNIQUE AND INTERESTING,"Three and a half stars really. I enjoyed the book but the chapters are way off, that is not consistant. Little more editing would have helped. Bourdain is colorful and sometimes controversial but almost always interesting. THE NASTY BITS is really a bunch of essays, some good, some blah, on his food world. I would suggest reading it to any of his fans but KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is way better if you haven't read Bourdain."
3,Not My Favorite,"I love Anthony Bourdain. There. I said it. I would love to hang out with him, cook with him, and well, let's just say, do other things with him. Except read this book.Bourdain is a genuinely talented writer, as he proved in Kitchen Confidential. He is a charismatic raconteur as he proves each week on his television show. But this book is a compilation of many divergent pieces, thrown together to attain maximum fiscal return. Because the tales vary so greatly, the reader is forced to jump from concept to concept without anything binding the pieces together properly. Don't get me wrong, each piece is well crafted, but just because they're all published together doesn't make for a cohesive book.If you must read Bourdain, re-read Kitchen Confidential. It will leave you more satisfied than this book."
3,Exactly as the title suggests,"I understand that the collection of essays is, just as the title states, a bunch of leftover junk writing from his various appearances in newspapers and magazines, but I still found it rather disappointing. For those fans who follow his writing and television shows, it really is just rehashed (even largely unchanged)material that we've all read and seen before. Most of the essays are deplorably short, and leave us wanting more in both the literal and figurative sense. The essay about the cruise-ship-turned-traveling-luxury-apartment-complex was one of the most boring things I've ever read. I feel sad to say that Tony has lost his spunk, and his edge, whether due to old age or overindulgence in his own overstretched career. He has become the very thing he eschews in his writing: a tired, banal sell-out."
3,The Nast Bits,"Anthony Bourdain has eaten from many plates and seen a lot of things. Some things, a regular consumer would prefer not to know about their food. The Nasty Bits reveals another side of the restaurant business, which is not so glamorous and delicious as we think. The author's style is very candid and often funny, which makes you just fly through the book in a couple of sittings."
4,He loved the gift,This book was on my son's christmas wish list. He loved it. He's a professional chef and watches him on TV all the time.
2,"If you watch Bourdain's shows, spend your money elsewhere","Most of us go to work every day, but only someone truly lucky can bind all of their e-mails and reports from the past year into a book and sell it. If you watch ""No Reservations"", you know about everything that's in this book. Shame on you, Bourdain.If you're not familiar with the author, ""Kitchen Confidential"" is a much better book. Heck, even ""A Cook's Tour"" (another Bourdain show) has more behind-the-scenes insight than this waste of space.That being said, I'll eat you under the table any day, Anthony Bourdain. Choose your meal and location, and I'll be there."
3,The ingredients don't mesh,"I'm having a difficult time reading this book, and likely will not finish it. If compared to a meal: the appetizer is lovely (the seal story) and whets my appetite for more to come. The salad is fresh and the soup hot. Then the entree comes and the ingredients don't mesh, it's undercooked, feels rushed, and I want to send it back. As another reviewer previously wrote, the stories have an ""already been published"" feel, and don't flow from one to the next. I'm about 3/4th through the book, too late to take it back, but don't know that I'll proceed to dessert. I want to cut my losses, get my bill, and get out, so I can read something else and not feel I got leftovers rewarmed under the heat lamp."
4,Worthy rant,This book may give a hint of what an evening with Tony is like.NahBut it is enjoyable to hear some back story and musings on travel and food.
3,"Miscellaneous collection, some pieces better than others","This book doesn't have the punch of ""Kitchen Confidential"" or ""A Cook's Tour."" Part of this is that the pieces, written for different magazines at different times, just don't flow together all that well; the other part is that Tony seems to be mellowing out in his old age, and his vitriol isn't as entertainingly bitter as in previous books. The book jacket alleges that there are critiques of Rocco DiSpirito and Mario Batali, but in truth they're more of an apologium for DiSpirito and some vaguely interesting personal information on Batali. Not the best introduction to Bourdain; of some interest to the diehard fan."
3,Bourdain's ups and downs,"I particularly like Bourdain's witty prose. Ordinary events come to life in his spirited narrative. He spares no one, fast-food industry, celebrities, the works. His accounts of things gone wrong are particularly funny. However, since this is a collection of texts published at different times in different periodicals, I have to say that some aged better than others. I simply skipped those I found less interesting. Do not miss the comments section in the back (I almost did!), where he produces a mea culpa for the poorer articles. Next time just leave them out, Tony."
2,Sure it's nasty - but it's the bits that bother me,"This is a collection of un-connected essays, rants and ramblings, some of which have nothing to do with the kitchen. Some of his arrogant, opinionated musing are still enjoyable, but I found many of them to be tiresome - in part because he's said much of this before. I found myself skipping through some of the pieces - I just don't care about how he loved the old, gritty, sleazy New York City. Even though most of the pieces are 4 to 5 pages long, most seem rambling and wordy.If you're a fan of Bourdain's writing, check this out at the library. If you haven't read anything by him, forget this book and purchase Kitchen Confidential immediately."
2,Skip It,"Obviously, AB not only defines but wears with pride the ""full of himself"" label. You need to back all the way up to his first book Kitchen Confidential to get a decent read out of him. That book is definitely insightful and informative and makes Anthony part of the story instead of making Anthony the story. Read Kitchen Confidential for sure, then drop all things Bourdain, and you will be doing well."
3,Disappointing,"I expected more! Not sure what, exactly, but this is a series of essays and articles written over a period of time for different papers, magazines, etc. I have always enjoyed Bourdain's kind of smart alecky East coast manner. We have that here, for sure. But there is a certain amount of whining about how hard it is to be a chef, how hard it is to have to travel so much, etc. Lots's of references to bouts of heavy drinking with other chefs which became tiresome reading after a while. He has a vocabulary problem, too. The ""F"" word seems to be the only way he can express himself. I am certainly no prude, but that also got tiresome. He is at his best when describing the wonders of flavors and foods found in various parts of the world. He creates wonderful word pictures about places and people that I did enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"I love reading Bourdains work and I pre-ordered the book thinking that it would be another spectacular work. I curledup in bed waiting to be deliciously teased,outraged,and most of all entertained by The Nasty Bits.Alas!I quickly fell into a stupor as it was only mildly interesting and somewhat contrived as if he had been under pressure to publish something and cobbled together a few scraps without the usual Bourdain zest.I sincerely hope that his next book will see a return to his unique entertaining style."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,How very disappointed I was with this reading. It became a chore and I made myself finish it. How sad since Mr. Bourdain is so talented with his writing and humor. Don't bother. He has become too big for his book binder/britches.
5,Faster than expected!,I received my book faster than I expected to have been shipped. It was in excellent condition and look brand new. I would purchase from seller again.
2,Didn't do it for me,"I thought Ilium was a good start to this series, but Olympos just didn't do it for me. I agree with much of what has been said in previous reviews. I haven't seen one of my biggest pet peeves with this book mentioned yet, so I will mention it. It is the endless reminders that the ""magic"" used by the Gods is actually accomplished via science. It seems to me after you make that point early in the book that you don't need to mention it again and again every time Zeus fire off a lightening bolt. It doesn't seem like a God can walk down the street in OLYMPOS without some convoluted hard science fiction explaination trapsing slowly behind. Some people obviously enjoyed this book, maybe it is matter of taste. Dan Simmons is an excellent author, and I am sure there are many great books from him to come."
2,Slow and steady decline,"Reading Ilium was a rush of quirky excitement that set up a fantastic and rich world. Olympos slowly, SO slowly, saps everything that was interesting about Ilium towards an absolutely incoherent ending."
1,Avoid If Possible,"If you're thinking about reading Ilium, don't. While it's a terrific read, it's actually half a 1400+ page book and reading it will necessitate reading Olympos, and Olympos is a pretty terrible book. If you've already read Ilium, I'm so sorry. Save the time and read a synopsis of Olympos, or better still, make up your own explanations for the mysteries in Ilium, they would almost have to be better than the explanations in Olympos, and you'll avoid 800+ pages of tortured, repetitive, and bizarrely misogynist prose that will attempt to negate your fond memories of Ilium. It is truly as if the second book were written by a different author, one whose obvious pleasure with himself belies his sophomoric prose, simplistic politics, and an annoying inability to see his own characters and plots through to a cogent ending despite the massive amount of previously mentioned repetition, not only from the first book, but within this mammoth sequel."
4,Loving this book,"I have really enjoyed this series. The first book was great, and this one is wonderful as well. I'm in the midst of it, and continue to be surprised and excited by it."
3,Too much of a good thing,"The review title refers to complexity, which is a source of satisfying reading, when practiced in moderation. In this work the complexity is slathered on so gratuitously and to such excess, that the story reminds me of a snowball that is pushed down a big hill and eventually becomes impossible to control. Even that would be forgiveable if the story didn't end with a number of loose ends and unanswered questions that proved to be a big disappointment. Since this is a review and not a BB I won't elaborate and possibly spoil things for a prospective reader. If its hard sci-fi and grand space opera you want, first read everything by Alastair Reynolds and Stephen Baxter, and for something a bit lighter and entertaining try Jack McDevitt."
4,Definitely worth a read.,"Just finished Olympus up (having read Ilium last year) They are both pretty powerful books, setting up a massive stage, and executing the story across the galaxy. The books themselves, while complete, however, ended somewhat abruptly, leaving several hanging plot threads, and hinting at either another story, or just that the author got tired. Can't really say for sure.Definitely worth a read, but just be prepared for a bit of head-scratching when you're done."
5,Dan Simmons Olympos,"Dan Simmons completes the Illium with a great story and a character driven conclusion. Those familiar with his work have much to look forward to as Hockenberry, Achilles, Harmon, Moravecs and more finally find out what happens on Mars and Earth and who is behind it. Highly recommended and hopefully a movie will develop out of these two books."
3,Engaging story with a whimper of an ending,"Olympos is a fine read. Simmons as usual has excellent characters, and very fine prose. The tempo of the story is fast and you begin to feel the dread of the characters. Unfortunately, I felt that the ending was weak and he didn't give the final umph I was waiting for in both the story and characters. Tantalizing close to being a great book.Pros- Ancient troy and hard science fiction melded together, engaging characters, tangled plot, good plot tempoCons- Didn't feel like the characters became completed, ending was weak."
2,Might as well read it if you liked Ilium,"Not nearly as good as Ilium, but when I finished Ilium I knew that I would read the follow up no matter what the reviews said, and I did, and I don't regret it. Just don't expect too much and you wont be dissapointed."
2,Very disappointing,"There is not much good to say about this book. Maybe one thing, it is readable. I finished it. I did not like it though. What a huge letdown after the Hyperion books. Boring and predictable. Too much of that scary zeitgeist - you know - islamist terror and anti-french sentiments. All that quite insulting in its blantness, really. The plot is weak and the author knows it. Why else would he try to spice things up with too many and too detailed sex scenes. Even sadder - the plundering of world literature. It seems as if the author had hard time coming up with anything worthwile on his own, so Homer and Shakespeare have to do all the hard work. Yet in this surrounding even they must fail. All in all not a book worth reading."
2,Some good memorable scenes...besides that it falls apart.,"Ilium was a great fun read and I was excited to find out how all these very interesting plot lines would converge and conclude...They don't.I was really looking forward to the transformed Daemon to battle Caliban in a mano-a-mano battle to the death. Even prepared for a Daemon to die in the battle if it was a good scene...never happens.I wanted to understand WTH was up with the whole Trojan war thing (the central premise of the book)...I never found out.And Setabos, Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Ariel...all of them are alive?not-dead but wtih no resolution.There are a couple of good scenes, Daemon stealing an egg from Setabos, that was good. Daemon and Ada and all them charging into battle towards certain death. and...well, maybe that was it.At least I didn't _read_ much of the lenghty prose but skimmed the last half of the book. :)"
1,"So bad I can't believe it's the same author as ""Ilium""","I'm going to be brief and steal a line from another review of a Dan Simmons book ""So bad it must've been a contractual obligation."" Simmons has failed this badly before with ""The Rise of Endymion"", another really really really bad conclusion to what started out as a great story much like Iluim. I mean Hyperion and Ilium are great, very entertaining reads, but after wasting my time (that's what I honestly feel) reading this boring, go nowhere book I learned a lesson about Dan Simmons...go ahead and read the first book of any series he authors and then just stop, use your own imagination to continue or conclude the stories he started, but whatever you do, don't read sequels to his books. Olympos is just a plodding, leaden, blunt instrument that will probably dim your brain."
1,Ugh.,"Read Illium and loved it. Thought it was engrossing. Couldn't wait to finish it all up with Olympos. But alas... no. This book was just not as good and thoroughly boring. Characters and plots and sub-plots all over the place. I actually stopped caring. When it came time to ""wake"" up a new character by having sex with her sleeping form, I gave up. Put it down. That's it. If I wanted that I'd read the The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty. I like Simmons work. The Terror was gripping and a page turner. Illium was also great. But this... and then the travesty of Drood. Ugh. Almost lost faith with Simmons. If you want an engrossing and complext sci-fi book, read the Dune books by Frank Herbert. If you want sexed up and pointless characters all over the place in an ever-confusing plot then read this. My two cents."
1,What is this,"It seems in the gap between illium and Olympos, Dan Simmons became a creepy pervert. I know that odd sex sometimes comes with the sci fi genre but this was just over the top. Also, literally nothing was explained. If there's a book three or something, everyone dies"
4,Trojans and Greeks and Robots... Oh My!,"What started out as an addictive romp trough the Trojan War ended with a whimper. I may still need the Ilium Anonymous Zeus mentions - but it will not be a painful withdrawal.In this sequel to the amazingIlium, Simmons continues his delightful interweaving of Shakespeare, Proust, Homer, Virgil and Nabakov (just to name a few) with time travel, robots and genetically modified beings.However, the abrupt changes in story arcs and subplots are unsettling, and the neat little bows tying up the tale are hard to swallow - even for fans of The Bard's comedies.Of special note: the author's inclusion of the delightfully poignant poem by daughter Jane Simmons may just make up for the plot deficiencies."
5,Phew!,"I loved the two Hyperion novels but was bitterly disappointed in the two Endymion novels, so after reading Ilium I feared the sequel, Olympos, might follow the same downhill pattern. What a relief to discover otherwise! And what a great ride! Unlike the hackneyed devices, static characters, verbal padding, and plethora of unanswered questions in the Endymion novels, Olympos was at least as inventive and engaging as Ilium and came to a satisfying conclusion. Both Ilium and Olympos take wonderfully unexpected twists and turns. The characters are memorable and are allowed to develop along the way. The sheer pleasure of hearing two robot friends discussing Shakespeare and Proust is worth the price of the book alone, but being a great fan of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's development of their characters as well. I only wish there were a third novel to look forward to!"
1,incredibly disappointing,"3/4ths of the book is a re-telling of the Ilium followed up by a lukewarm, ending that isn't an ending at all. For shame Dan Simmons! You can do so much better, Olympos is a waste of your fans time and money while you obviously didn't spend enough time on it."
2,Worst Ending Ever.,"The English teacher in me wants Dan Simmons to rewrite this story and get it right. What happened? Ilium was enormously entertaining. I couldn't wait to see how everything would come together! None of it did.This is particularly disappointing because I know Simmons can do it. He is, after all, the architect of the fiendishly convoluted and complex Hyperion saga -- which he brought to a brilliant and satisfying conclusion. This finale, however, ties up nothing.I won't repeat the litany of loose ends listed by other disappointed readers. I'll simply add that I feel their pain. I don't know that I have ever been so let down by an ending.At the very least we deserve a final showdown between Caliban and Daeman!"
1,could not finish it,"I have had this book for weeks, about half way thru and calling it quits.The worst book from Simmons that I've read, couldn't even finish it and that's no mean criticism as I'm a big fan."
4,"Very good, not quite great","I have gave the previous book, Ilium 5 stars, so 9 out of 10 stars for the series. <>Like the previous novel, Olympos is a very imaginative and I loved how Simmons mixes historic literature (Homer and Shakespeare) with science fiction.My two criticisms of the book are:1) The science in Olympos, especially some of the ideas dealing with quantum theory, become increasingly implausible and look more like magic and fantasy than science fiction.2) The ending was quite anti-climatic. I wasn't expecting a Fall of Hyperion ending (my all time favorite ending) but Olympos ended with too many loose strings and unanswered questions. As another reviewer noted, where did Moira, Sycorax, The Quiet come from? Ilium left me with the burning question who or what were these Greek gods and where did they come from? I didn't find the vague explanation in Olympos satisfactory or plausible.Still, all in all, it's a good book and a great summer read."
3,Ummm...,"The ""Quiet"" is coming?! *Gasp*It's very mention has the Demigorgon saying you ain't seen nothing yet?! *Gasp*It's very mention has Setebos packing it up?! *Gasp*Oh it came alright. In the form of crickets at the end...I love Dan Simmons and enjoyed the book but every reviewer here is right in his/her own way. *sigh*"
2,a big letdown,"While reading this I kept picturing an editor standing with a gun pointed at Simmons' head. Lots of sloppy loose ends and non-sequiturs that are not befitting the man that could pull HYPERION together. This book had a lot of promise and ended up feeling like a waste of time. If you've read ILIUM you'll probably feel compelled to read this, but don't hold your breath waiting for some epiphany.As an aside, what's up with the sloppy exposition near the end where he describes a pair as ""partners"" but not in the late 20th Century use of the word. Was that wink for us? After that, it's all whimper and no bang...sorry.Dan: take your time next time."
2,Disappointing,"As others have said, the loose ends are tied up too abruptly and sloppily. I'm not a Straussian, but I am willing to hear an argument well presented on the behalf of those ideas. Ilium did so. Olympos does not. At the end of the day, the picture of the old-style humans regaining their humanity through agon and aristeia simply was not convincing.And Simmons really needs to get over the fact that men in classical Greece had sex with each other. His shrillness on this was really jarring and distracting."
3,Reminds me of ...,"... the Night's Dawn series by Peter F. Hamilton. That one was about 2,900 pages of really great stuff -- characters, plot, mysteries -- and about 100 pages of Deus ex Machina.Olympos ends with a similar thud.This was disappointing, as I was hoping for a really creative ending -- no matter how implausible.There are some funny scenes (my favorite: Achilles in Tartarus), but overall, it seemed like Simmons took the first book and just kind of cloned it into the second."
3,Strong until the end...,A fantastic start with Ilium I was looking very forward to devouring the conclusion. In the end I was left wanting and very disappointed at the lazy ending.
3,recycled Hyperion saga,"His power of imagination is unmatched in today's sci-fi genre, yet Mr. Simmons reached his peak with ""Hyperion"". Same style has been used in this one, thus, regardless of all quality and ingenious story-telling, I still couldn't escape the deja vu feeling. For people just being introduced to Simmons' work, this is an excellent ""appetiser"" book. Then, you can proceed to the most wonderful creations: ""Hollow Man"" and ""Hyperion/Endymion"""
3,Very disappointing,"As other posters have said, this was not the Simmons book a expected. Here are my gripes...1. Who was Circe/Sycorax, and what motivated her?2. What was the point of Harman's venture into the sub, except for just getting fataly irradiated and saved by the moravecs?3. Why did Noman and Savi release the stasis field around that sub and endanger the whole planet?4. Where was the climactic battle between Damien and Caliban?5. Setebos just dissappears? WTF?The first book was so good, this one was really painfull. I think something went south when Mr. Simmons decided to stop writing Joe Kurtz novels anymore..."
1,Deus ex-machina fest,"Is with sad sentiment that I must write this review. I very much enjoyed past books of Mr. Simmons, but there's no justification for this total waste of pages.People which talks in mysteries for no apparent reason, prophetical situations that lead nowhere, lots of things unexplained, lots of things that happen just because the characters say it must be so. Unbalanced racism, unnecesary sex, glaring plot-holes...There are still some gems inside: fascinating places and the moravecs are still lovely. This is just proof that here what fails is the plot, not the technique. However, I'll go for the lowest rating because we're not talking any regular writer, but the much more capable Mr. Simmons.Mr. Simmons can do better, he must know what has caused this debacle. I surely hope his future books regain his old strength."
3,"Good book, Bad vendor","So far this book is a good read. It is the second in the series of 2, the first being 'Illium' by the same author.However the book that I received was in terrible condition. I will not buy from that vendor again."
3,"great writing, but ultimately disappointing, i'm afraid","Many are the delights one experience while reading Dan Simmons novels such as Illium or Olympos: great writing style, wonderful battles, an infinite imagination, beautiful prose, interesting characters, great humor. Simmons keeps his readers going setting wonderful scenes and launching great mysteries. We wonder what the heck is going on. So we keep reading and reading, because we want to find out. Ultimately however, we don't get the answers and are left with too many questions. Very unfortunate.Still, Illium and Olympus make for a wonderful read. Just don't expect that everything will be clear in the end."
4,"A triumphant ""return"" to form...","I've been waiting for something like this from Mr. Simmons ever since I finished reading the ""Hyperion"" series years ago.While not as likely to blow you away as those particular 4 books are, this is a very enjoyable series that will not disappoint fans of Mr. Simmons' ealier ""SF"" work."
5,Character Connection,"The Character Connection tapes reflect the best of what clinical wisdom and behavioral science have to offer on rearing healthy children and youth. Inherent in this approach is the recognition that relationship rather than manipulative tactics and stratetgies is the key to successful parenting. The conversational format complements the message by being interactive rather than dydactic. Principles of successful parenting emerge through discussion of concrete, real-life questions and situations. I recommend Character Connection to both prospective and current prents as a guide to the most important endeavor adult life has to offer."
3,Just a normal standard backpack.,"I ordered this believing it's a 2700 cubic inch as stated on Amazon's website. When it arrived, the tags say 1800 cubic inch. I went on to check on Coleman's website, yes it's made 1800 cubic inch. Worse of all, I had to get another backpack from somewhere else for my winter trip which was like 2 days away.Now, after about 3 weeks, I checked back here on Amazon and it says 1800 cubic inch. I swear it was stated as 2700 cubic inch here when I bought it.Overall, it looks good. with necessary straps and stuff. Front compartments with organizer. Definitely not for week long travels. Side mesh pockets have elastic bands and contain the water bottles really well. Padded back for comfort. Hip strap is normal but I do find it useful. For a bargain price of $19.99, this is a 5* product, if not for the confusing description on Amazon's part."
3,3.5 stars - a bit slow at times,"Ursula is a strong, independent woman, but not unrealistically so for her background or position. The mystery is okay, but the characters and depiction of the period kept me involved. Although it dragged a bit at times, Buckley paints a wonderful picture of the life and intrigues of court life. I would read another."
3,"A little slow, but good to historical mystery lovers!","I love the Elizabethan time period, so of course I loved this book! At times my mind wandered, but over all, a good read!"
4,Elizabethan England,"Enter the world of young Queen Elizabeth I with this novel which introduces us to Ursala Blanchard, a widowed young mother who has become a lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Queen Elizabeth, embroiled in a love affair with Robin Dudley, has sent Ursala to Robin's ailing wife's manor in the hopes that she can quell the malicious rumors against Robin and, by inference, against the Queen. While there, Ursala finds herself at the center of the scandal and must use her wits to try and get to the truth. This is Buckley's first Ursala Blanchard novel; others follow more of the adventures of Ursala and the Queen. A caveat: to us the language seems more 19th century Victorian than Elizabethan English."
1,STAY AWAY! DO NOT BUY.,"The only thing positive about this phone is it's looks. The battery life is terrible and we even charged it properly by letting the phone drain and then re-charging. Once the phone beeps, you better run to the speaker phone as you only have seconds before it shuts off. Unless you like to do a lot of running, I would stay far away from this phone. And yes, the buttons are slowly, one by one, not working. If you press it just right after several tries, it will shut off."
1,Handsets are unreliable,"Good features on this phone system, the speaker phone is really great and the power-outage battery backup on the answering machine is really nice too. However, the buttons on the handsets stop working after 12-14 months making the phone unusuable. We have had this happen on 2/3 handsets. This phone is going in the trash, I'm replacing with a Panasonic."
1,Not worth a single penny,"We bougth this phone almost a year ago and I absolutely HATE IT. The battery dies even without using it (in all thre phones!), it is always ""searching ...."" for signal even beside the base! which causes you to loose communication. A lot of times, while on a call, the phone rings and displays the ""incoming call"" message, which has the same effect as the previous problem. NEVER got a satisfactory answer from Motorola. I just keep it because we are so angry that we spent around 280 USD for an entire system for our home. I am amazed to have found good reviews. DON'T BUY IT"
3,"Works Good, good button feel, Battery sucks.","The phone works fine, good button feel, great price, battery runs down quickly.Oh well, can't have everything."
2,The worst phone ever!!!,The phone did not work correctly from day one. Trying to get help from Motorola's 800 number proved a waste of time. I lost the receipt from Target so now I'm stuck with this junk.
2,Love everything except the sound quality,"I really love the look, feel and features of this phone. However, it's going back tomorrow because it sounds like I'm call people with a tin can on a string. There's no way to change the channel this phone uses and the manual does not have a section for troubleshooting problems of any sort."
5,This is the best phone we have ever had.,We have had this particular phone since Christmas and we absolutely love it. It was one of easiest phones to learn to use. We have already added two more phones to go along with the set we already have. Motorola actually gives you their phone number in their booklet and when you call you actually talk to a real person who does know about this phone. I called Motorola just to see if a real person answered the phone;they did.
1,This phone stinks!,"I thought that the Motorola name meant something. This is the most expensive and worst phone that I have ever owned. The list of problems is long, including a useless extra handset, phone turns itself on, so you don't know if anyone is trying to call you. The answering machine never has the right day of the week. It takes forever to listen to your messages. I contacted Motorola, and got no response. Please don't buy this phone, I'm sorry that I did!"
1,Horrible purchase,We bought this phone about 8 months ago and thought since it was Motorola that it would be a great phone. This phone is horrible. The buttons on one of the phones do not work and you cannot hang up the phone (which is horrible when telemarketers call). Now we are having trouble just talking on it. The reception is horrible and it periodically cuts off your call. I thought is was a freak incident but others have complained about it also. I am very dissappointed in this phone. Save your money and buy some other brand.
4,Great features...better service,"I bought this product less than 8 months ago. Loved the intercom features and the 3 expansion units.Easy setup options. The key pad on the base is a plus as well. For the number of features I found it to be the best buy. However, one month ago I noticed the handset buttons randomly quick working. Some phones would not register. On one you could hear the caller but they could not hear you.I was down to leaning over the speaker phone on the base to answer the phone. I called Motorola service, ( 800-353-2729}they said they were aware of the problem, had fixed it and are sending me 4 replacement handsets at no charge. Even after 90 day warranty had expired!"
2,Good functions. Bad quality,"Its a very useful phone, but battery didnt last long. It doesnt charge anymore. I have two handsets and one of them, some of the numbers dont work anymore. Sometimes people cant hear you talking even though im near to the base. Wouldnt recommend to anyone if you want a telephone that last more than one month."
3,Buttons stop working,"I like most of the features on this phone. However, I only had the phone for a year and the ""OFF"" button for the handset doesn't work any more. I have to press it about 15 times to end a call or get out of looking at the caller ID menu. The buttons are too cushion-y."
2,Don't buy this phone!,"I bought this phone in March, the buttons stopped working in April, about 3 days after the store warranty expired. I called Motorola and had to send back my base unit and phone as well as one of the expandable phone I bought (making all other expandable phones in the house unusable) at my own expense. Now, seven months later, I have two phones that you can't press the buttons again, and need to find out if I spent over $150.00 on a phone I now need to replace after less than a year. The functions on this phone are wonderful, I love the ring tone. But this many problems in such a short amount of time are not worth it."
1,What's up with the buttons?!!!,"This phone was a huge mistake! While I agree with Kacie that the interface is relatively easy to use, after 9 months or so the buttons started to go out and, over time, they have failed completely on both handsets. $130 down the toilet. I have an el-cheapo Panisonic cordless that is over 10 years old and still works great despite the fact that it has been hugely mishandled over the years. In just one year these phones are useless, despite the fact that, they have been handled with kid gloves. I urge anyone considering this to also look at the reviews of the handsets themselves (Motorola MD41). Pages of people having the same problems with the buttons. What a joke. I live one mile from one of Motorola's largest US offices. I'm tempted to drop by and give them a piece of my mind!"
2,Bad sound quality,"I love the features on this phone. That's why it gets two stars, but the sound quality just isn't there even when you are standing right next to the base unit. Sometimes there is an echo (or tin can) effect which I thought might be due to a low battery. And I have also noticed the short battery life. With a fully charged battery you still get unclear sound. I'm often forced to go pick up the corded phone for clearer reception."
1,Very bad quality,I couldn't use it even a complete year. I have a unit with four terminals and after 14 months all the keypads from all the terminals were unusable. Very bad quality.
2,Heed all the Reviews! This Phone does not last...,"I decided to invest in a more expensive cordless phone after buying numerous phones from chain stores that didn't last for one reason or another. I thought for sure this one would last after spending over $50 on it. Unfortunately, I've only had this phone for a little over a year and already the buttons won't depress on two of the handsets and the batteries won't charge. I thought for sure this phone would last beyond a year and I would have gotten my monies worth. I'm a single person and I have 2 handsets and both are giving me trouble. I now have to answer the phone using the speaker button and sometimes it takes me about 30 seconds to hang up the line when I'm through talking.. I can't even use my call waiting feature anymore 'cause the flash button doesn't work..When it worked it was great. I love the speaker phone and mute features, but what good is all that when you can't even make a call in the first place?I'm at wits end!"
2,Agreed Bad Quality,I have 3 of these phones..one with answering machine and 2 base/handset units. All 3 phones now have buttons that don't work..on one none of them work. I loved the phone the first year or two we had it..but they are worthless now!
2,poor quality,"After 2 years, various buttons on all three of my receivers have stopped working. We can no longer answer the phone with two of the receiver (the ""on"" button doesn't work), but can dial out, with the exception of the 3 button. The 5 and 9 no longer work on the third receiver.The voice message quality (outgoing) was poor from the beginning - crackly, like a worn out tape (not what I expected for digital).The range is acceptable, and reception was clear in every room of the house and outside in the back yard.Not a total loss, but I wouldn't buy this phone system again. I really don't trust Motorola's quality after using this product, so will be looking into other brands."
3,not so phony,"I haved had this set for 3 years and have had no problems that are listed above. It sounds great, works great, and my daughters put the batteries to the test regualarly."
1,You'd do better with some tin cans and some string,"We've had this phone for almost a year now, only because it's just too expensive to replace. The sound quality is just terrible. I'm not sure about battery life, since we rarely keep it off the hook, so I can't speak to that complaint. I just know that I have such a hard time hearing or understanding people on any of these phones. This is a shame, because we have a single Motorola cordless that works so much better. I'm in the process of searching for a new expandable set since I'm just tired of dealing with this one."
1,Don't Buy This Phone,This really was a horrible phone. My biggest complaint is that the battery lasted less then a day in some instances. You would charge it all night long and after a 5 minute call the battery would show 1/3 charge left. My old Panasonic would last for more than a week after one charge even with some serious talk time. This Motorola junk was returned within a week and I got a new Panasonic Dual Handset.
1,Don't Bother,"This phone is NOT worth your time or money. I have had this phone for 6 months and I am going back to Panasonic. The answering machine breaks up the mesages, so that you can not hear them. The phone sounds like you are talking into a tin can and has constant static. The battery does not last more than 3 hours."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"Okay, I've read the reviews and hope the rest of you thinking of purchasing this phone have as well. The basic advice, do not buy this phone or any other phone from Motorola. This phone as well as the MD41 have a keypad that WILL fail in about a year; just past the warranty period. I have called Motorola and they will not claim responsibility for this issue. Other posts have said that they have gotten remedy from Motorola; which is good for them, but now Motorola has stopped that practice. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY OTHER PHONE FROM MOTOROLA!!!"
5,Informative and enlightening,"I have attended several Gentlecare seminars and also have this book. Moyra Jones does a fantastic job of explaining the disease and offers ways of improving care and quality of life of people with Alzheimers.I work in a dementia unit which follows Gentlecare recommendations/guidelines and have greatly increased quality of life, dignity and independence for our residents.This book is a ""must buy"" for anyone who works with/cares for Alzheimers/dementia patients."
3,Some great essays,"Of the 13 essays in this collection, 6 of them are truly solid and insightful offering us evidence and interpretations of how the categories of gender and free status interacted in the Greek and Roman worlds. Joshel and Murnaghan's introduction sets the intellectual stage for the entire collection and I could easily see assigning it in an upper level undergraduate class. However there are two reasons why I can't give this more than 3 stars. First, 7 of the essays do not follow through with their stated agendas and indeed seem a bit confused or wandering without reaching specific conclusions. Secondly, the essays do not seem to be arranged in any logical or chronoligical fashion and frankly there is no ""Greco-Roman"" world -- there is Greek culture, there is Roman culture and then there is where the two meet but these are three different cultures and should be treated as such."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"I would suggest that you would have to really like Amber to bother with these and want to fill in more parts of the story. I am not sure I would bother with much more. That being said, however, while it is not the original, this is not a bad book. Basically average, and if you are really into the Amber thing, it is more than likely you will enjoy this to some degree or other, so don't let that put you off."
1,What's that sound I hear?,"Oh, that's poor Roger, spinning in his grave...Betancourt is a hack. I've read better ""fan fiction"" on the Internet. I wish Zelazny's estate had honored his wishes, or at the very least, found a decent author to continue the legacy.I recommend that fans of Roger's style check out the tribute collection ""Lord of the Fantastic""."
3,Buy the other book by Schaap,"This book is based upon the ""screenplay"" of the movie, not the actual bio of Braddock which was written by Jeremy Schaap. This book includes ""Hollywood"" versions of what really happened...like the part where Braddock is pan-handling with his hat out at the Garden...that's not the way it really happened. He actually went to visit his manager Joe Gould at the Garden to borrow the $35 from him and him alone...he did not pass a hat around for donations.The book is well written, but again, it gives the Hollywood take on it and if you really want the factual depiction I recommend Jeremy Schaap's version.Great story none the less."
2,No Surprises,"Often seeing a ***** film leads me to seek further pleasure in reading the book upon which the film was based. Unfortunately, this book adds little and would more aptly be called a narrative script of the film. - Anita Madsen"
4,Good game,This game is very fun but the cards that come with it one card is the new rare version of blue eyes white dragon and two monsters i never even heard of but it still a great game
4,FREE BLUE EYES,When I found out there was a Blue Eyes in this game I had to get it. Why because I have a dragon deck. The game is ok but I was expecting more duelists.
3,nice game but could of been better,i only give it 3 stars because mosty it needs to be multiplayerand needs more computer players with more things to say then the samething over and over. other then that its a great game.they fix this then it will be a 5 star game...
4,A wonderful set,"This is a great set of the Ralph Vaughan Williams symphony cycle. It's the best I've heard so far--especially the 5th and The Lark Ascending. Definitely five star performances. The only reason I gave it only four stars is that the set is recorded at such a low level that you can't hear much besides the really loud spots without cranking the stereo up high; and then the loud spots are REALLY loud. If you can deal with that, then get this set. You won't be disappointed."
5,The best VW set available,"While there may be individual recordings of the symphonies that excel, this is the best set available, with consistent performances and excellent sound. I'm not thrilled with the packaging (slippery individual cardboard sleeves inside a cardboard box), but it does make for compact storage. Nice choice of ""filler"" music, as well."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Loki reveals to the Asgardian gods who Odin is and how he has manipulated them. Mephisto's plotting is also revealed.Captain America, being dead, is in the afterlife, and still thinks something is rotten, so gather a band of like-minded heroes and decides to do something about it.They have to find out what the builder of Paradise true motivation is."
3,regulator,works ok for what I want it to do. I am not using it for breathing but for controlling the flow of oxygen out of cylinder.
5,"A ""Must Give"" Gift for Baby Showers!","Desperately searching for a cute book to give an expectant friend, I again turned to Lorilee Craker's fresh, fun style of writing. And I, too, could not disagree more w/ Spelly regarding the spiritual content of this book. While the vast majority of books on pregnancy and childbirth are secular in nature, it was wonderful to find one that had a spiritual ~ no, CHRISTIAN ~ content. The Biblical thread was interwoven throughout this book with a wonderfully quiet spirit. It would offend neither those who aren't Christians, nor those who are more mature in their faith walks....and my friend who received this book as a ""Gee-I'm-So-Happy-You're-Pregnant!"" gift? She loved it, too!"
2,Meh.,"If you're into popular magazines and television, you will probably like this book. I enjoyed the entertaining style in which the book was written, but there was not much factual information in it... a lot of subjective experience and dramatic reactions to being pregnant."
4,Not your typical pregnancy book,"I recommend this be one of the pregnancy books you buy. It is informative and helpful, but it is also a pleasure to read because the author has a great sense of humor!"
5,Super Adorable,Can't help but smile when watching this! Both characters are just so cute and work well together. Enjoyable to watch.
4,Funny little dance number not included in the theatrical version,"I thought that this was the infamous dance sequence that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did in the movie when he's ""high"" on love. But it's actually a featurette of the DVD that includes him going into a bank with sunglasses on, seeing Summer (Zooey Deschanel) behind the counter as a teller, and then slowly transforms in to a short three minute dance number. If you're a fan of the movie it's a nice little addition. Nothing fancy but it was entertaining to watch."
3,It's OKay,It's Okay for a short clip that is free. Will like buy the movie at some point in the next few months. There - I typed in 20 words. Are you happy now?
3,"OK, but really nothing to rave about","We found it disappointing, a bit slow and while it has its moments overall it left us feeling kind of blah."
3,Dance,When I picked this selection I was hoping it was the musical part where he is walking to work the next day.
4,"Easy read, but a little dramatic.","Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. Aside from a few irking grammatical errors, the Harvard graduate, Lou Ann Walker, writes well. The book is very easy to read and seems to be targeted towards a younger audience(ages 16-18). Seems like it would be a good book to read on a five hour flight or in the airport.I'm a fourth year Psychology student on his last semester, so, the book wasn't quite at my reading level nor did it pique my intellect. It did however, enlighten me towards deaf people and was a good supplemental required read to the ASL course I am taking."
3,A Loss for Words,The quality of the book was a little worse than expected but the speed of delivery was very fast.
1,Boring,"I was supposed to read this book for my Sign Language class, but I started the first chapter, and was incredibly bored. This book is slow, and boring."
5,Great Book,"I purchased this book for a class I took over the summer. It was an amazing story, very informative and moving. The book itself had some wear, as a used paperback will, but no highlighting or writing in it and was a great book for the price. The library also took it when I was done as a donation."
5,"Family story, deafness and hearing","A very touching, funny, poignant and interesting book. I got it for a sign language class, but I would recommend this to everyone. Quick read. Hard to put down once you start reading it!"
1,OK looking shoe but way oversize.,A 10 fits like a 11 or larger but a 9 might be to short if you are a 10?????
4,A great book! Excellent start for your battletech experience,"This is a great book for anyone who has not yet been subjected to the battletech universe. Betrayl, Murder, Love, Action, Adventure; this book has it all. The first book in the GRAY DEATH LEGION saga. Read all of the gray death legion saga!!"
4,Decision at Thunder Rift,"i have always been a lover of battletech as it just grabs with it stories, am big fan of the grey death legion trilogy, is just a pity that the earlier releases from back in 1987, are so hard to find, had once a large collection of battletech novels, but had to sell all of my battletech novels, but now am going to try find all the novels once again."
1,I threw it out,"I had high hopes for this thing. I was looking for a decent car vacuum but this thing had a lot more features. The vacuum couldn't pick up much of anything, the battery life was terrible, the flashlight wasn't very bright, the plastic tray that goes underneath with all the cables and such has tiny tabs that slide in slots on the main body's underside, and one of them was broken on arrival. I didn't bother to return it because the tabs were so flimsy I figured they wouldn't last long anyway.I never tried the compressor feature. Just tossed it last week."
3,Interesting Device... a bit clunky... but works!,"I have yet to use this product to inflate my tires or plug anything into it. It just arrived a few weeks ago. The instructions on how to use it were not that great (go figure) and not all the parts fit into the tray (pictured) that goes underneath it. Still... i've never seen anything quite like this before, and I'll keep it in my car and hope I never have to use it on my tires!"
3,you get what you paid for,"this box cannot hold a thicker ring that it makes it not sit up right once inserted in the whole meant for the ring to sit in. But if the ring is thin it ok. however if you're looking for a box that doesn't look cheap at all, find a different one. although i may say the leather cover was acceptable and clean."
5,Pretty presentation boxes,"Perfect style for giving/selling either new or vintage rings. Very elegant. Recommended.Only issue is shipping is a bit high. Still a good product, especially if there is nothing locally available that is suitable."
1,terrible,This product is horrible! I opened and closed one box 2 times and it broke and the other one would not snap back shut! So unsatisfied!
2,Cheap,These are not made very well at all. Great price but in the instance you pay for what you get.
1,Looks nice but beware when you open,"The boxes looked nice but when you opened them, they broke apart. I put 2 items in these boxes hoping for a nice presentation but was really embarrassed when the recipients opened the box and it split open too far spilling the contents. The white boxes they came in were all broken and smashed as well. Not worth shipping back-do not buy!"
1,Threw them in the garbage,VERY poorly made. There's no way I could give someone a gift in one of these so i through them out. Waste of money.
1,better off putting it in a crackerjack box,"What a ripoff? To think I purchased two of these makes me twice the fool. Shoddy craftsmanship, the glue on the bottom of the boxes was visible. Open the box more than two times and it will snap. I had to go to a jewelry store to get a somewhat decent paper box that was a third of the price of one of these. I will say that it was delivered quickly."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The boxes were great upon receipt - just don't expect much use since the hinge will not last more than a few open/close actions. Then you're left with sprung ring boxes that neither snap open or close but instead flop listlessly. Useless for storage or display.
4,Nice for the price,"I needed a couple of boxes for eBay listings and these fit the bill. The white outer box was a nice extra. There is a slight plastic odor at first, but hey, I'm not complaining."
1,"HORRIBLE, CHEAP!",I purchased this about a week ago and they already broke...very cheap product. I will never purchase from this company again
1,These are re-records and live tracks.,"Portland Trail Blazers; Rip City! Well ripoff anyway.Right on the back label: 'Selected tracks are live or have been re-recorded by original artist OR other acts as availability allows'. And this is manufactured in the Czech Republic. Humm....'Ain't No Sunshine' is a Bill Withers signature song and even a fine singer like Al Jarreau bring something else to it and its simply not the same. The two live James Brown songs real are flat and lifeless and isn't James at his best. But enough said, this really isn't worth the paper and plastic its printed on.Walk away, save the cash..."
5,Simply the Best,"This is my favorite worship album-- ever!!! It has the most powerful songs and you can tell that the people at these services are just praising the Lord in full. Some of my favorite songs are People Just Like Us, (He's Real) All the Power You Need, I Will Run to You, Eagle's Wings, The Great Southland, All Things Are Possible, The Potter's Hand, Shout to the Lord, Hear Our Praises, You Said and This is What We Came Here For. Hillsong Music Australia blends some of the best tastes in music on this one album. It has 32 amazing, powerful and beutiful songs on it.You can feel the energy and the presence of the Lord, Jesus Christ on this project. The lyrics on it are so true and listening to the songs make you want to jump up and praise God. My final thought is that this is a great album and if you enjoy up-beat and worshipful music this is for you. From the writer of Shout to the Lord, it's simply the best."
5,best--ever,"If you've seen my other reviews of these guys books, you know I'm now a fan. I looked up their website and they apparently do teaching classes, so I'm hoping Central Market down here will get their act together and have them in. I made their chocolate gelato. Move over, Giada, that's all I can say. OK, so they're not Italian. But it was the most silky thing I've ever eaten. I actually made a trial run of it one day when my parents were coming over and ended up eating the whole batch by the end of the day. So I served some coffee cake from the store. It was worth every calorie. I haven't told anyone in my family I made that gelato because I don't want them to think I'm nuts. Plus, I want to surprise them with it. I think I'm going to make some gelatos for Thanksgiving and skip the pie."
3,"OK, but . . .","This book is OK, but there are others out there that are equally as good or better. LOTS of repitition in the recipes. The recipe for Peach Gelato is pretty much of a bust. No one here liked it.Of course my negativity may be brought about because I was expecting something similar to American ice cream, while gelato is a whole 'nother thing."
5,Wonderful!,"This book is so beautiful and I am so fortunate to have found a copy of it! Ms. Ellison has captured the true feelings of Romeo and Juliet with her pictures! From the very tips of the dancers fingers to their eyelashes you truly believe that they ARE Romeo and Juliet, from their first meeting to the scene in the tomb. By the time you finish reading you are completely swept away to a world where true love is so beautiful and so inviting, you cry. Ms. Herrera and Mr. Corella are two of my favorite dancers and they fit the part perfectly! Ms. Ellison used the natural light given to illuminate the dancers and give an extra sense of feeling to the story. To everyone who buys this book take it to your heart and believe that anything is possible."
3,"Beep, beep, bye-bye","Overall this is a good product but details can be niggling. The phone beeps to confirm the handset has begun charging which is fine in concept but it seems to resettle itself periodically and repeat this beeping no matter whether it is in the desk or wall position, with the handset in either way, and with very clean contacts. So despite some cool features like a speakerphone in the handset I am returning this item because I already have too many things that randomly beep at me.The talking caller ID worked ok but for wireless callers it wasn't helpful, even if you had the number and name in your address book. Also while the number is displayed instantly, the talking caller ID takes until about the second ring to start by which time you've already gotten up :)"
5,Great Phone,"This is an excellent and full-featured cordless telephone and answering machine. It has many handy features and a digital answering machine that works very well. The sound quality is good, though I think that the handset could be a little bit more ergonomic for listening, but that's a minor flaw. What I like best is having a speaker phone both in the base and in the handset, extremely handy if you are waiting on hold and need to move away from the base phone.I've been buying Panasonic products for years and have never been disappointed in either their features or their quality, and this phone is no exception to their excellent standards."
4,fine for the blind,"I purchased this phone so my mom wouldn't have to scramble around for her glasses in order to read the caller id. The phonepronunciations aren't always the best but it works. As long as one's hearing is satisfactory then the talking caller id is great. I wish it would read the name that was programmed in the memory for a given phone number. When I call from my mobile phone it will display and talk ""wireless caller"" rather than my name associated with the number in the phone's PHONEBOOK. My mobile phone does not have my name display on the caller id b/c it is a prepaid phone - I'm sure it would work fine for those that have a mobile phone with a contract."
1,Awful battery - Handset dies within 10 minutes,I am a great fan of Panasonic phones but this is a very bad buy. Battery dies within 10 minutes you initiate the conversation.
1,Horrible Phone,"I have this phone and all of it's features are good, but the phone itself is TERRIBLE! There is so much static on the line I find myself walking upstairs to switch phones in the middle of a conversation. The instructions suggest you change channels if you incur static - have yet to find a channel that does not have static!"
3,Works great except poor display,For me this phone performs flawlessly as advertised. My problem is the displays on the handsets are tiny and poorly designed and difficult to read. The actual text display is buried so far behind the plastic lens that the lighting has to be just so to read it without glare. Theere is a helpful backlight on these displays but the light goes off after a few seconds. My vision is not what it was and I cannot use this phone without eye glasses. By the time I focus on the display the light goes off and I'm dancing around the room looking for a lamp. I know it's impossible to please everyone with these gizmos but if I was shopping for another phone I'd buy the one with the biggest display. If you can easily read newsprint in a dark room you're going to love this phone.
3,it was supposed to be new,The phone works well but I bought a new phone and I think I received one used as it had five messages for someone named jerry and the phone had some marks on it. As I sent it to a friend who was on US and he brought it to me to Argentina I could not change it for a new one.
2,Careless about Chris,"Okay, so you just bought the remake of Resident Evil and are looking foward to kicking some zombies' rotting butts. Only one problem: where the heck do you go to get farther into the game? Well, this strategy guide should tell ya...If you're playing as Jill. The people who wrote this startegy guide should be ashamed. They forgot that it's a multiple character game. They show you what to do as if you were playing as Jill. Instead of writing two seperate strategies they just tride to slide some of Chris' here and there. If you want to get through the game as Chris, definately DO NOT buy this strategy guide, go with the other one by Brady Games."
5,A must have,"A must have for the anniversary additon. Allows player insight to unlock areas to advance. Well written , easy to follow"
1,Nice Flood,"This housing has gained some notoriety due to its tendency to have the lower o-ring pop out if not aligned perfectly, which, due to its odd shape, is quite easy to do.Chalk me up as one of the people this has happened to, and it was awful. Fortunately, my camera was insured, but sure enough, one of the overpriced o-rings in this camera came completely out at the corner, flooding the housing COMPLETELY full of water.This was a year ago. I switched to Ikelite's housing for the 5060/7070 and have had NO troubles, and the customer service is far preferable to Olympus'. The Ike housings are more expensive, but not as expensive as having to replace a camera!"
5,High performance planning blueprint,"This book should be considered the new standard for high-performance coaching. Kaufman provides a solid, strategic, measurable framework to plan and achieve superior individual and team performance, moving the discipline fuzzy psicologysms to tangible, rational assessment and planning.I recommend this book as a guideline and orientation tool for high potential performers. It will help them to set and achieve value-adding goals aligned with their organization and their organization's clients."
4,Phosoplex-Great so far,"I am on my second order of this bone and joint supplement and so far I can honestly say that it has helped me feel better. Usually in cold weather my joints feel achy and since starting Phosoplex, I havent felt any pain in my knees as often as I usually did. I will keep taking these supplements"
3,This made my arthritis pain subside somewhat,Usually when it is cold or damp weather my body feels achy especially my knees and my hands. I have noticed that I don't hurt as often anymore and my hands don't feel as stiff. I will continue to use it hopefully soon I can needlepoint without disconfort.
4,I am thankful for Phosoplex,Phosoplex has made a difference in my life. I feel better and more active thanks to this product.
4,Amazing supplement,Tis is the best joint supplement I have found on the market. Thank you Amazon for carrying it.
4,Phosoplex has helped my arthritis,I am happy with this product. I haver tried various over-the-counter arthritis pain relievers and this supplement has helped me for the better.
4,Phosoplex 4 star review,I felt immediate relief since taking Phosoplex. My only concern is that the UPS delivery guy left it at my neighbor's door instead of mine fortunately they are honest people.
3,on my first order.......was highly recommended,I heard so many great things about Phosoplex. I know 2 people personally that have had great success taking this product. I can't wait to report back with my results!
2,joint med,"this med is for joint relief. must take 6/day to get quantities needed. there are better products out . i would not buy again. MENDAMINE is a better product, and helps"
1,Like having food poisoning,"I tried this once -- took all four pills and yes I had breakfast -- and a few hours later became so nauseous, started sweating and shaking, and vomited as if I had gotten the worst food poisoning. Such a bummer, cuz I so wanted this to work for me. Can't tolerate it though, and lost a day of work to boot. Buyer beware."
1,Doesn't work for everyone!,"After taking the four pills in the morning I was nauseated. At first it wasn't to bad, I thought I can handle this and continued to give it a try. However the nausea got worse and after two weeks I had to stop because I didn't want to feel sick every morning. I didn't notice any difference in my joints during the two weeks."
5,5 star product,This product has helped me around the house. It has been doing me good in many ways. I look foward to taking more of this product. Me and my wife are happy with this and will continue to take it. thank you
4,Has helped me feel better overall,This is the most successful product I have tried. I feel a tremendous difference overall. I recommend phosoplex to people over 30 to stay healthy in the bone and joint department.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,I thought by the reviews I would be getting a good product.I've finished the whole product and was surprised that I feltno better than if bought a $10.00 suppliment in a grocery store.
4,Thank You!,I am 42 years old and have gone through 2 knee operations. Unfortunately I was having post operative pains on my left knee for the past year because of the cumulative effects of the operations and arthritis was definitely settling in. I had tried everything to help alleviate the pain but nothing seemed to really be that effective. I have been using Phosoplex for three months and it has proven itself to be an extremely powerful product. I no longer have the pain in my knee and I am back to having an active lifestyle. Great product!
3,In progress,Just purchased to experiment with. Have tried several different brands now knowing what will work for me. Will edit and add comments later
5,Love this product,"I have been taking Cellaplex for almost 2 years and it has worked for me. I have very bad arthritis and have had 4 surgeries on my knees in four years. After the last surgery I ordered Cellaplex from Amazon and have been very pleased with this product. It has changed my life. Now I can drive, shop, and even walk with no pain."
1,Poor Quality,"A few good songs, but some obvious ad-libs, many songs with poor audio, and too many advertisements for public radio."
2,Rock and Roll at 50,"This DVD wasn't all it's cracked up to be. Some of these performers and songs were remakes, and the quality of the recordings isn't very good."
3,Rock and Roll at 50 - Good performance - sound could be better,"I enjoyed the groups and the performances. These are valuable and I am grateful to those who put this part of history together in order to preserve it. However, there should have been a 5.1 soundtrack. I was disappointed. I believe the original recordings would have permitted this. I would have rated it 5 stars if this was the case."
1,Depressing,"Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home."
4,'Rock And Roll At 50' (Sony) Various Artists DVD,"To be honest,I really expected this music DVD to be totally lame,with most of the artists to be lifeless old farts and hags that could hardly carry themselves properly onstage.Glad to see that I was very wrong about that.As it turns out,'Rock&Roll At 50' is quite entertaining to watch.Many very good/well produced performances by the likes of Bo Diddley,playing his namesake ""Bo Diddley"",Jerry Lee Lewis,with ""Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On"",Brian Hyland-""Sealed With A Kiss"",Gerry Marsden(of Gerry&The Pacemakers)doing two of his gems,""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying"" and ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"",one time hit maker Paul&Paula with ""Hey Paula"",The Manfreds playing ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"",pajama pop idol Lesley Gore giving us ""Maybe I Know""(looking good at 59,Lesley)and Darlen Love(of the Crystals)with ""He's A Rebel"".Those are just the highlights.Total of 22 songs.Recommended for true pop fans over the age of 55."
5,Rock & Roll At 50 is excellent!!,"I was really pleased with this DVD, as was my husband. It was good to see some of the rock & roll singers performing today. They all looked good and sounded good. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of rock & roll."
2,"Book has good plot, but lacks good character development","The concept for the book is good, but the characters are not at all realistic. They have very simple emotions and do not use the type of language 90's teenagers use. Lacey in particular is unbelievable. She is this extremely angry girl with a rotten home life, yet she still talks like a 19th-century grandmother (as do all her characters). I realize McDaniel may personally be offended by strong language, but if you are going to write good literature you need to be able to create a character separate from yourself. McDaniel does not seem to be able to do this often enough to consistently create believable characters."
3,Def Jux,"If your a real Def Jux fan then you already have almost every song on this album, if your new to Def Jux then you should pick this up as an introduction to a great hip hop label."
4,The Shape of Things to Come...,"Not too crazy about the first 2 tracks, but the contributions by Cannibal Ox and RJD2 make this 7 song disc worth every penny. Can Ox should appeal to fans of both indie hip hop and the more thuggish variety, with their gritty beats and suffocating lyrics. RJD2 provides a very pleasant instrumental and El-P expels some ugly demons from within. Aesop Rock also does his thing on ""Kill 'Em All."" Most importantly, this album is just a taste of what El-P's label will be putting out for years to come. This is like a baseball team with loads of young talent."
4,There I was...,"This author's narrative makes you feel like you are a part of the story. From the comfort of my recliner, in the warmth of my den, I experienced flying the Alaska outback. Excellent descriptive scenarios that cause you to read faster to learn the outcome. Highly reccomended for anyone who enjoys aviation or just a good adventure."
4,Don't miss out.,"Sally Oldfield has been a big success everywhere but in the US, and the only reason I can see is she was overshadowed by her brother, Mike.This album strikes me as very innocent both in its sounds and ideas. A purity of joy and an almost naive voice, it's a real mood lifter that takes advantage of mystery and nature to create a sound like bells and clear water. Soothing, original, and yes, you can sing along."
4,Oldie but goodie!,I bought the vinyl version when it was first released many years ago so purchasing the CD was something of a trip down memory lane. I was not disappointed. Sally Oldfield's vocals are light and easy on the ear. So refreshing.
5,Love it,"I got this as a wedding gift from my registry and I absolutely love it. About to order a few more. It was a perfect way to display pictures from our wedding and cruise (We got married on a cruiseship out of miami, like a destination wedding!) It was so easy to hang and insert photos. People always comment on it and have received soo many compliments!"
4,Question (not a review),"Sorry, I know this may not be the right form/place for this but... can someone please tell me how big in total this frame is. I roughly estimate it's about 16*20? thank you so much?"
3,Great for the money,"I shopped and shopped for a collage frame. I got this one because it offered the largest number of photos in a ""random"" display. I filled the frames with a collection of themed photos and the final gift was a big hit. The down-side, however, is that the frames are plastic. That means that the overall collage is flimsy and scratches easily, but what do you want for $20?"
1,Acrylic photo collage defective,"The acrylic photo collage, although very attractive by design, arrived damaged. Two of the acrylic frames were broken off and there were a few scratches on the other frames. I would've exchanged it but since I was 500 miles away setting up my mother's room in a nursing, it would not have arrived before my departure. I purchased some glue and fixed it, but the light scratches remained."
5,Melannco - Floating Collage Frame-10 Opening,Like these so much that I have purchased 4 of them......:o)
4,well....,the first one they shipped came totally cracked and damaged BUT i called them and they resolved the problem asap... it's an awesome frame just a bit delicate. My girlfriend loved it. You can fill it up half way and make new memories to put in as time goes on. Great frame concept.
4,Review of Frank Lords DANCE ROMANCE (Mega Mixx),"Great mid 90's dance album with featured artists; why? Because I am on it (Garry Coston singing and covering Commodore's hit single ""Oh No."") Aside from me being a featured Artist, all of the vocalists, for the exception of maybe one male vocalist, are at the top of the tier; and Frank keeps the dance music moving and uptempo. Great dance album!"
1,Bad movie,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen Christopher Walken must have needed money real bad to be in this trash.
4,Fun for the Children,I brought this DVD for my daughter who was 4 years old at the time. She enjoyed dancing and singing along. This DVD is really geared towards the young... wouldn't recommend it for a child over 5 years old.
4,Great Interactive Video,"Very fun video! My 2 year old daughter loved it. She loves watching the other kids, and definitely gets into the singing and doing the movements. My only negative is that the video seems short. I wish it was a little longer. Other than that I would definitely recommend for any young child to start moving and grooving."
2,Lame,"My 2 1/2 yr old lost interest within 5 minutes. There's no actual dancing on this DVD. just a ""Simon Says"" game throughout the DVD."
4,St. Valentine'd Day Massacre,An old classic film (1967) that is fairly accurate account of 1920's Chicago gang war between the Capone/Moran factions. Good acting by a stellar cast.
5,Great gangster film!,"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre is a documentary style movie depicting the events that led up, occurred during and after the fateful massacre orchestrated by Al Capone. Jason Robards stars as Al Capone and does an excellent job bringing the sadistic gangster to life. The movie is well written and the facts and timelines are taken directly from news reports, police investigations and participants in the massacre. This is an excellent addition to anyone's gangster movie collection."
4,Nice!,"This is a classic. If you haven't yet seen it, I strongly advise that you should. It's a well known formula - bad guys fighting it out for control of a city. A few mistakes were made with the casting (whose idea was it to have Jason Robards playing Al Capone?) but nonetheless, it is a great film. That is, for a Roger Corman film."
4,Fairly accurate,"It's fairly accurate account of mob warfare in 20's Chicago.Most of actors resemble the real gangsters,except one!The most important character is Al Capone and who does Hollywood think resembles Capone?A thin full haired Jason Robards???????Besides that minor error it's still Historically Good! END"
4,Not Bad for a Movie,"Very few films based on actual events actually base themselves in fact; Here's an exception. This film gives are very clear and easy-to-follow account of one of the bloodiest events in Organized Crime history. Though there are a few questionable points here and there, all in all it's gripping and entertaining. In spite of the cheesy 70s special effects and the tendency to cast actors twenty years older than the characters they're portraying, it's worth the purchase/watch."
2,Thoroughly Disappointing,"I happen to LOVE mobster and mafioso films, so I took a chance on this one. As far as films of its time of production, it's passable, though campy. The acting, surprisingly, was second, no - third rate. Few if any of the characters were convincing in their respective roles. The soundtrack and narration were notably good - the screenplay spells the downfall of an otherwise talented cast that tried in vain to save this film."
2,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre DVD Review,"A watchable movie, which is basically an elongated colorized version of an old Untouchables TV episode. Jason Robards is badly cast as Al Capones, and George Segal is hardly convincing as a gangster."
3,one year before BONNIE AND CLYDE,"BONNIE AND CLYDE, in 1968, with michael j pollard, from corman's THE WILD ANGELS, might as well be the artistic version of this 1967 movie.jack nicholson has about 30 seconds in this movie[...]he never was corman's favorite actor; dick miller and bruce dern have bigger roles in this movie---they were the actors corman loved to work withHas sets, and, seemingly, narration leftover from the tv show THE UNTOUCHABLES; lots of narration, to tie together disjointed scenes.Jason Robards and George Segal were nominated for oscars in movies prior to this---corman doesn't bring out the best in them, either.Fast moving movie, but nothing origonal."
3,Dark Humor Nearly Undoes Gangster Flick,"This is certainly an enthralling picture that's very handsome looking. Two things to me nearly scuttle the picture. An obtrusive narration that undoes the tension for those of us unfamiliar with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Secondly, the film contains a lot of broad humor that for the most part falls flat. It makes the hoods seem like a rogues gallery from a cartoon. George Segal's enforcer is too tongue-in-cheek to be truly menacing. Jason Robards, however, is chilling as Al Capone. Not a bad picture but certainly a missed opportunity."
5,St. Valentine's Day Massacre,Great action packed film. An excellent retelling of the famous 1929 massacre. A must have for action film or history films.
4,Eyes of Dragons and princes turned to killers...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I know that it is not an average King book, but I also know why. He wrote it for his daughter, which explains why it is more like a faery tale than his usual horror. However, it is very expressive for a fantasy book written by a horror author. You have to consider that he is the master of surprises, he knows what his reader expects and he refuses to give it to them. Everyone hopes that Peter will be the one to get rid of Flagg, but that is not what King allows. His ending is really effective, and his resurrection of the importance of the ""little guy"" really makes the book a true work of art. I recommend this type of book to the audience that will appreciate the combination of unnerving and thrilling with the ever-popular prince and his heroic quest."
4,Great,I love stephen king books. Generaly because they are horror stories. But even though this was not it still had a great story to it. I am a fast reader but that aside i would say this story is best when read over a short period of time. It has alot of things to think about that can easily be forgotten. The only bad side is that it seems like a childrens book but has some unnecessary sex scenes which have nothing to do with the story. Other than that a 5 star book.
4,Steven King weaves a spellbinding tale,This book is a must to be read aloud to children over the age of nine. King presents the story in such a way that the listener is entranced by what is being revealed. Forshadowing keeps the story suspenseful and the book is filled with pieces of wisdom that are best passed on in just such a way as this. As the tale unfolds the reader will find themselves racing to the finish; feeling the same urgency that Peter feels in his attempt to right a terrible wrong and save his kingdom from disaster
2,I Didn't like it,"I really didn't like this book. I thought it would be better than what is was. I thought it was going to be a horror story, not a fantsy. It was O.K. It is not my favorite. My favorite is The Shining."
2,Through the Eyes of the Writer,"This book was my first Stephen King book. I've heard of many negetive comments about him, and I'm sorry to say that many of which I totally agree upon with. The book was very lame. It had a terrible plot, a very undetailed setting, characters who act like they came from the ""normal"" world when they're suppose to be in an uninteresting very very unorginial fantasy kingdom, and a villain who should just destroy the whole kingdom. The book was very lame like I said once again. Please save your money, and don't bother."
1,Predictable and boring,"Either his name is written on the cover of this book by accident, or Stephen King has really just evolved into another bland teller of boring fairy tales.""Eyes of the Dragon"" is about as predictable as possible. It's a 'typical King' in that it takes a little long to get to the peak, but it offers no great suspense or even anything else of interest other than that. I can hardly remember anything of the plot. Strangely enough, I feel myself longing for the times that King still wrote his short stories/novellas. Oh well."
3,Enjoyable,"Very enjoyable but not Sthpens normal book. This is a traditional Fairy Tale. It is an easy, quick read, but you will enjoy it very much. Do not go in looking for horror or you will finish very disappointed."
5,fantasy from king,"I have read a lot of fantasy in my life. I think that this book stands as one of the best single volume fantasy tales written, and that fact that it is nothing like anything else King wrote (which I have also read a lot of) makes it even more of a treat. If you are a fantasy fan, you owe it to yourself to read this book and rejoice at the fact that when it is done, you do not have 10 more volumes to read.If you are a King fan, then this is where things get interesting. This IS NOT anything like the Stand, It, Salem's Lot, or any of the other books that got you to first start reading King. This is a book about knights, wizards, scheming magicians. Give it a try. If you like it (which you will), move on to Martin's Song of Fire and Ice."
3,Avoid if possible,"This was my first Stephen King book I ever read. If you are a fan of King then it would probably be better. Except I didn't like the ending, he leads you into thinking there will be sequel. Though I thought it was interesting he didn't know much about this story. It gets born when Peter gets inside the tower."
3,A parent's review,"Will I let my teenagers read this? Yes, I will.Will I read this out loud to them as a family book to enjoy? No.This is a great plot, suspenseful and exciting, and written in Stephen King's signature style. He works in those little details as nobody else.This book gives a good, hard look at how to raise a young man, and how not to. The sibling rivalry between the two princes is heartbreaking.Lots of typical Stephen King gross-out -- vomit and turds and sexual inadequacy and blood being spilled and the banality of life."
4,No real dragons?,"If you want this book for dragons, like i did, you're waisting your money. Otherwise, it is a really good book."
2,A half boiled fantasy?,"In the eyes of the dragon is a book which I doubt would have gotten published had it not been for the author's fame. As a fantasy it is disappointing, in that the story's background is never expanded on enough to properly snag the readers imagination. The storyline is one which any s/f or fantasy reader will be unimpressed by, as it is cliched and unimaginative. My main gripe about the book though, is that it is wrapped up hastily at the end, leaving the reader feeling that something is missing, a couple hundred pages maybe. I really expected more from King..."
4,good but distracting typos,"i bought the kindle version of this book and while i enjoyed it very much, i was very distracted by rather bsd typos that were inconsistent through the whole story. delain would become detain, pulled to putted, and faster to easter are just a few. it became distracting and disappointed me because as a book by a major author you'd think they would take more care in creating the digital copy. i wish i could get some money back for that.otherwise i really enjoyed the story and was glad to have read more related to the dark tower."
3,Disappointed in writing style,"nice story. i know it's written in the fantasy genre, but it is a huge departure from Stephen King's usual writing style. It's not easy to forget that you are reading a story. I usually get lost in his books. It even seems juvenile in places. Thready plot in places. I was disappointed overall in this book compared to what i am used to with his work."
5,A Terrific Tale,"From the master of horror comes a fine, not-too-tender-hearted tale of a boy-king, a magician, and loyal friends. Oh, you can guess who the bad guy is right off, and he is very bad in the tradition of the Dark Magician. He also lets his boy-king be really good - superhuman even. I doubt that readers will care. There is nastiness in the adult world, and young readers will find it here. They will also find steadfastness, loyalty, and intelligence. Underneath it all lies What It Means To Be Human. A great read for the middle grades, not only because it is carefully plotted, but also because the vocabulary is very good, the narrative voice consistent with that of the great British story weavers, and the depiction of ""long ago"" just rank and ripe enough to pique a curiosity for more."
3,okay,Long story boring in the middle but good in the end up until the last 10 pages because the ending was awful
3,It's not about dragons,"There was a dragon in the plot but it had a minor part in it. It was more about political intrigue, involving regicide, 2 royal heirs and the throne. It was a story about human inadequacies and failings. It was a story about raising to greatness and fear of not raising to the occasion.This book is not the typical SK book. It is easy to read and the simple prose conveyed the essence of the story. Certainly not to be compared with grandness of The Stand.In the end I couldn't decide if it was a fairytale for adults or was it an adult tale for children."
4,"A very good story, but a little to long.","This is the most imaginative story that I've ever read, but a little boring and not very exciting. It still is a very good book, though"
4,"Great story, awful editing","The story is wonderful, so well done, so comfortable to read and well told.This Kindle version is so poorly edited the book is almost hard to follow."
2,Not One of His Best,"I typically like Stephen King's off-beat, not gory, stories. Unfortunately, this is not one of his best. The plot line is really weak, more like a children's book. And he reveals the twist in the plot way to early to maintain interest. I finished it because I kept thinking it had to get better; it was Stephen King, after all. But it didn't get better. I will still read King; everyone can have a bad day."
3,The Eyes of the dragon,"THis book was very suprising to me, i always liked stephen kings books of horror, but this was different. The theme was great and the charectors were very awsome. But i was not as interested as much, some parts were just boring and very hard to follow along. i like his horror books better."
5,RABID KING / DARK TOWER FAN,"THIS IS AN EASY TO READ BOOK. IT IS NOT AS COMPLICATED AS SOME OF KING'S WORK. IT'S QUICK TO FINISH. IT TELLS ALOT ABOUT FLAGG, THE EVIL WIZARD! IT'S A WONDERFUL READ WITH A LIGHT FEEL TO IT. (MEANING ""LIGHT"" FOR KING) THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR KING'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS THIRTEEN AT THE TIME. THIS MAY GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE READING. THE SIMPLENESS OF THE TALE MADE IT ALL THE MORE ALLURING. IT HAS A FEW PRE DARK TOWER HINTS. IF YOU ARE A KING FAN, AND HAVE NOT READ IT, IT WILL BE JUST AS ADDICTIVE AS THE OTHERS."
4,Unexpected,This was not what I expected from Stephen King but was very enjoyable nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,The Eyes of the Dragon Reveiw,This book was an excellent example of the way that Stephen King writes. The characters seemed real and I had a clear picture in my mind. The setting was neat back whn they had kings nd queens. Great use of imagination. You couldn't put the book down the book kept you hooked. There was always something that you wanted to find out or learn about. This book could easily be turned into a great movie. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I recomend this book toanyone who enjoys suspense and is a Stephen King fan...
4,not bad,"heard a lot of good things about this book, not the best king book I have read but not the worst either...the last fifty pages were great"
4,It was pretty good,"I got this book off of a reading list, and, seeing how it was written by Stephen King and a fantsay, thought it would be good. It was, only I didn't really like its writing style. The story was original though, and I give points for that.The plot was easy enough to follow. Kingdom ruled by a mediocre King, with a wife everyone loves and an advisor who's just plain evil. Has two sons, wife dies giving birth to the second. Peter, the eldest, is perfect, and Thomas is...not. Flagg, the evil advisor, thinks Peter's a problem. A big problem. So he kills the king and blames it on him.All and all, not bad. But not one of my favorites, either."
3,Interesting enough,"I adore all of Stephen King's books. He has a way of transporting you to completely different worlds with an ease that is unique only to him. But I was slightly disappointed with this book in that, while the plot and details itself were great, it was a little underwhelming. I always finish his books with mixed emotions: ecstatic about yet another great story and sad that it's over. This one left me with an empty feeling...like getting turned on and then being left hanging. I'm sure you know what I mean. But it was entertaining. Everyone has their own opinion though."
5,the eye of the dragon,"book as described and excellant condition and shipped right away and packaged very well.great service, i would use them again."
3,book review,At first I was a bit disappointed in the beginning of my reading. I felt it was to wordy and taking to long to set the story up but after that I found the book interesting and it kept my interest. I haven't read a Stephen King book in awhile and did so for my book club. Once the story really started it intrigued me. I was pleased with the promptness of the delivery of the book by the company.
4,Not your normal Stephen King story,"I was very interested to read this book, because it was a break from the norm for Stephen King. It is a tale of a kingdom, a murder, an imprisoned heir, and ingenuity. Overall the story would never rate with the pure fantasy Kingdoms with made up languages and cultures. But it is an interesting read, very tame for Stephen King... a kids story. There was only one piece of questionable language I can remember, which is vastly different than the characters in most King stories."
3,Nice fairy tale,"Interesting and quick, but not memorable. Doesn't grab you like some of his work. Was light fun. Not much more."
3,I liked this book,"It was really good, I felt like a E. Poe type of story, whom I also like to read from."
4,First King novel I read!,This was first Stephen King book I read and enjoyed it. I am not a great fan of horror but enjoy fantasy so I read my sister's copy when I was a teenager and was pleasantly surprised. Great character development and a real adventure. it was quite a journey..
3,Exceptional piece of work by Mr. King,"Not as good as his other work, but not bad at all. Although I like the illustrations by Kenneth Linkous better then illustrations by David Palladini. Kenneth had better affinity with Kings work."
5,This Book Rocks!!!!,"Eyes of the Dragon is by far the best book I have ever read, from King or anyone, Flagg, is the perfect evil magician. The medieval setting described took you there with detail, it is a nonstop suspence that you won't be able to put down."
5,I could hardly put this book down!,"The Eyes of the Dragon has the very best plotline. It tells about how a kingdom is about overrun by a wizard named Flagg. Flagg has ruined about all of the royal family, but the prince prisoner takes an unexpected risk while Flagg thought he was at the top of things. The ending is somewhat predictable but it keeps you thinking about what will happen next."
4,Flagg is a comin' again,"This book is a departure from King's normal style, even more so than the Dark Tower books. But it's still darned good. The story, while actually rather simple and slightly juvenile, is tight, and the characters are well rendered. But the book is really worth reading for the antagonist - Flagg. Almost certainly the same Flagg who has appeared in ""The Stand"" and even more likely to be the Dark Tower's Marten, who is going by the name of ""Richard Flagg"" in Wizard and Glass. He's a magician who uses trickery and murder to cause chaos in a kingdom . . . just like Marten. There are more ties to the Dark Tower- a King Roland, for instance. But I shant spoil the whole thing for you. Read this book, blast it!!"
3,Well....,"The book is wonderful don't get me wrong but it reads too fast for my tastes. Now that I think back on it I can't even remember half of it, although it is interesting to meet the main character. We know that he meets up with Roland the gunsliger somewhere along the line. It is basically a swashbuckling adventure with Randle Flag thrown in."
2,Not anything like King's other books (negatively),"This book is so not-King. I unconsciously checked the author's name many times before I really realized it. There was nothing left from the real King, the master of story-telling. It was just another unimaginative fairy tale."
1,It had no plot.,"The book started out ever so slow. After explaining the characters in about 100 pages it gave a slight story plot. -The king is dead, wrongfuly imprisoned prince, evil magician, brother of the accused becomes king and stinks at it. From there it explains his time imprisoned until exactly 78 pages remain in the paperback book. From there is where all of the other pages lead to. There are two reasons why this was a best seller when it first came out. 1.Stephen king wrote it. 2.First publishing had beautiful pictures in it."
2,childish,"I am not a child and this book was written for one, thus the reason of such a low rating. It was overly childish like watching sleeping beauty, except sleeping beauty has a scarier villian. Young people or those who like Harry Potter may enjoy this book, but it was pretty dull to me. I haven't read a lot of King besides the Dark Tower series but this is much different. If you like extremely simple stories this is for you."
1,Horrible,I read this book and was extremly upset by how much of my time was wasted reading that terrible book. It was a book with a bad plot. It was a book that was semi-well written. I would have to agree with someone elses review by saying it seems like one of his kids wrote it when they were twelve. The only reason it got any good reviews is because te people that actually read it from cover to cover hated it so much they did not want anything to do with it.
3,Kindle version has lots of spelling errors,"I love Stephen King, and ""The Eyes of the Dragon"" didn't disappoint. What was disappointing were the numerous spelling mistakes in the Kindle edition of the book. Someone needs to go back, fix them and re-download the corrected edition to previous buyers at no charge."
4,W. Sierra (NB Michigan),"I am a huge fan of Stephen King and will read anything written by him. I bought this book on my Kindle. I loved the story, but there were so many mispelled words and puncutation errors that it was very hard to get past. I have noticed there are more mispelled words in the Kindle version of Stephen King's books than any other I have read. I have read over a hundred books on Kindle."
5,Great Story,"I'm not a huge fan of fantasy books but I couldn't put this one down. It's only the second fantasy book I've ever read (and loved). The first being, 'The Hobbit'."
5,reader,For anyone to give this book a negative review must just have something against Steven King. This book was the first real Science fiction type fantasy book I have ever read and I must say he is the one who got me reading fantasy... The detail he gives and the plots are just wonderful. This was my favorite book till I read Terry Goodkind aout 2 years ago. This is another book of Steven Kings that proves he knows more than horror. I wish he would write more like this. In fact I have read this book twice. GREAT BOOK one of the best Steven King books I have read.
4,"fairytale by a horror-writer, eyes of the dragon","Steven King is mostly known for his excellent ability to write horror-stories. But nevertheless his tale ""The Eyes of the Dragon"" is one of the best I know. It can't be compared with 'it' or 'the Stand', but it has the same quality. King knows how to build up tension and curiousity in the readers mind. Once started, you can hardly stop reading the book. It tells about friendship, a bad magician, the relationship of two brothers and has a good ending! That's just the stuff wonderful fairytales are made out of. I recommend it strongly to all others!!!!"
3,Not bad for younger readers,"More of a teen's first fantasy, lacks the drive of King's horror plots. Readable but not something I'd recommend to a regular King buff but would to more of a sci-fi addict."
4,A great read based on a fantasy realm,"This book is quite possibly the first introduction into one of King's recurring characters through many of his books, the dark man Flagg. Set in a fantasy of old this book places the main character, a prince, in conflict with Flagg after the king is assasinated. With definate similarities to Hamlet this book is a definate break away from King's norm of fright/horror, and I've thought that this different form is where King does his best work. This is an interesting book that flows beautifully and should be in your collection."
3,"Good plot, not enought action.","It was a very good idea, in a great setting. I loved the dog. I just kept waiting for the big action scenes. In the end it felt a little hollow, a little slow."
5,One of his best novels,I read this as a teenager some time ago and had fond memories of it being one of my favorite books of all time. I recently decided to read it again prior to re-reading the first three Gunslinger novels. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. I strongly recommend this book to Dark Tower fans.
5,Wizardry and Witchcraft,"Once in a far away place called Delain was a king named Roland, who later married Sasha. She became Queen of Delain, bore two children Peter and Thomas. The oldest, Peter grew up loyal to his father. Thomas, on the other hand, grew up a very bad boy. Flagg who was a close advisor of the king, pretended to be Thomas's friend. Nobody knew this but Flagg did not like the king. He secretly killed the king (with poison), giving Peter the blame making Thomas the king. This also sent Peter to the top of the Needle (jail in Delain)."
5,This book is about a young prince being put on trial.,"The book The Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King takes place in the Kingdom ofDelin. The story is about the wrongful imprisonment of the heir to the throne. peter was accused of murdering his father and was sentenced to imprisonment at a cell at the top of a tower. Know he must be able to prove that he did not murder his father (Roland) and to be let free and to claim his place as the rightful ruler of Delin. This is one of the best books I have ever read. This book takes place in my favorite time frame: the middle ages. I recomend this book to all people that like fantasies and Stephen King's novels. This has almost everything in it: magic wizards,dragons,swords, action, and treachery I would like to award Stephen King for writting this awesome and wonderful book. Reviewed by John Neeley"
5,Thanks Stephen for another great book!,"I really enjoyed this book. Love the style of storytelling. As usual, King's characters are real and the themes are interesting."
3,Not one of King's best,"Minus: The pacing in this book is excruciatingly slow, and the way it's told in the third person with the narrator making self-references adds a detrimentally insulating layer between the reader and the story.Plus: The story itself is good, and the characters are interesting and believable."
5,easy to read & very interesting & entertaining,"brings back childhood memories of good and evil, a really feel good book. one you will want to read over and over again. I know i do"
4,One of the best fantasy books there is.,"The Book ""The Eyes of the Dragon"" by Shephen King is one of the most imaginative books I've read. This novel can easily capture your mind with it's use of description and detail. This book is filled with medevial characters. From kings to queens. From knights to dragons and from trust to betrayel. This book is not like any other Stephen King novel. It has a lot of deception in it. You'll think one person is on one side, then at the next paragraph he/she is not. If you like Fantasy books and tales of wizards and warriors with a twist, then you'll like this book."
4,"Very good book, not very good kindle book","excellent book and I must recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fantasy. But I must also warn you that if you buy the kindle version there are a LOT of typos, ""Faster"" becomes ""Easter"", ""get"" becomes ""oet"" and so forth, it is not every page, but it is frequent enough to become rather distracting."
3,Kindle version needs to be fixed,"The kindle version of this book has a ton of spelling errors that really take away from the story.The book was very predictable but I still enjoyed the book, I liked the different style of writing and the overall story. The build up was very slow tho and I did feel as if I was reading the same thing over and over in some parts so I think that it probably should have been edited a bit more then it was.I am a huge Stephen King fan but this is not one of his better books and I can understand why a lot of his fans were disappointed."
4,Typo City,"A decent King book, but there were way, way, way too many typo's. It almost feels like the text was scanned in from the original book. If not, then the publisher didn't proofread this book!"
3,Eyes of the Dragon,Bought as a gift. Was disappointed in the yellowing of the pages. I certainly was not expecting such poor quality.
3,Entertaining.....................................,I enjoyed this book! Not deep with story but deep with feeling.
4,The wait definitely worth reading,A type of cool down from all the fright. The determination was terrific and one in a life time. Desperately looking forward to the end of the book as the prince to his escape and same gasping effect King brought us in The Shawshank Redemption. Extraordinary and Satisfying
4,It would be nice if Amazon told you this was the Screwed & Chopped Version,rapalot has decided to re-release a lot of their older catalog but they have S&C all of them. I'd be happy with that if I wanted to buy the s&c version but I don't so someone needs to get their description right.
2,The OTHER REVIEWS ARE CORRECT,I bought the FS Fighter Pilot while in a computer store a couple of months ago while I was perusing other sim games. It caught my eye and I bought it. What a mistake. The most pathetic of all aircraft in the package is the F-15...especially the cockpit. This teaches me to not buy a product without researching the reviews about it. Lesson learned.
1,Shame on Abacus,"The front of the box brags of 85 fighters. When I installed the expansion, I found 85 paint jobs for 4 jets! Grrr! On top of this lie in advertising, the jets have horrible sound, lack any kind of flying realism to be for a flight simulator, and have cockpits that look like complete crap. Wait, they got one thing right - jets do look cool, but that's about it.Do not buy this garbage! You'd have better quality downloading aircraft from the net for free, then paying for this trash."
2,Fighter Pilot For Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 & 2002,"This game is misleading because you can only fly 5 or 6 different types of aircraft, not 85 aircraft as mentioned. The other disappointment was that you do not have the option of firing any weapons. Not happy about this one..."
3,Fighter Pilots DOWN side,"To play fighter pilot you need to have FLIGHT SIMULATER 2002 OR 2004, and the game doesnt come with a free joy-stick, it takes five minutes to install. The game does not have 85 aircraft but it has the Thunder Birds and The Blue Angels,F-16's, F-14's, F-15's, and, F/A-18's, along with different designs of aircraft from other countrys."
5,Bewildered by some of these customer reviews...,"Because I found Nelson's book thoroughly engaging, I'm bewildered by the customer reviews that take her to task for ""writing about herself."" The woman wrote a memoir, not a book report. I, too, would have appreciated a little more info on some of the books, but what she chose to include instead--e.g., asides about book lending and borrowing; digressions into great first lines; anecdotes about her family relationships, always related to books--felt very much of a piece. This isn't the last word on books, and doesn't pretend to be. It's a simple, charming memoir of one reader's year of relentless, idiosyncratic, disorganized, blissful reading."
4,So when is the sequel coming out?,"I truly enjoyed this personal, interesting, and easily relatable account of a life lived with one's head in a book. Nelson's writing is peaceful and quiet, but compelling, and I enjoyed hearing about the ways in which her reading life intersected with her everyday life. This book doesn't have reviews so much as a flowing commentary on how whatever book she was reading impacted her, made her think, brought up old memories and feelings...I felt like I was with a friend, for sure."
2,Useful to new readers only,"I see from other reviewers that I am in the minority but I was terribly disappointed by Sara Nelson's book. I thought that it was trite and didn't express anything that I, as a passionate reader myself, didn't already know. This is more for the neophyte who would like to read more. I thought that books such as Nancy Pearl's ""Book Lust"" and the lovely anthology ""Where Books Fall Open"" were much, much better and fulfilled what I was looking for: Literary passion and great title recommendations. I expected that this would read much more as a journal of a year of reading but it was more like a series of simple essays, nothing new or unexplored here. I thought it would have been better as a journal or maybe if she had made it a humorous look at her year. Rather it seemed pointless and I was disappointed but clearly others loved it so just know that it is not really a journal when purchasing."
5,"Loved it, neuroses and all","I'm so surprised that anybody who has read this book wouldn't give it five, or at least four, stars. it's funny and it's honest and it's so brave. Wow. I can't believe Nelson has the guts to say the things she does, about books and about her life. It's very personal, but that's what makes it interesting. It kind of reminded me of Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird: she's nutty (nuttier than Nelson, I'd guess) and by admitting to her own foibles, she makes the rest of us feel better about ours. The thing I find weirdest is the people who don't think she has a sense of humor. I laughed out loud a lot.Oh, and one more thing: This book isn't a novel, and it never says it's a novel. So I don't get the reviews that keep calling it a novel. A novel is fiction, people. This is nonfiction. Memoir. The book list is the bonus."
2,What a disappointment,"I've never written a review for Amazon before but this book has driven me to it.I approached So Many Books expecting so much more. Ms. Nelson's breezy takes on literature and life are facile at best. Her discussion of stopping a book before you have finished reading it resonated deeply with me while I read this; although greatly tempted, I was actually curious to see how much more she could annoy me (a lot) during the remainder of the book. When I read her bio on the jacket, I should have realized that this was more for Glamour magazine readers and less for true readaholics.It seems to me that she is a full-time book reviewer, and therefore a book a week should hardly be a challenge; yet there's an underlying whine about such an onerous task. By the end of the book I was only wondering why her seemingly long-suffering husband is still in the picture (it can't be because of her sense of humor)."
1,Very disappointing,"I thought this book of all genres--at least in some detail but it didn't. I thought the cover was fun..you can't always judge a book by its cover. I read less than a 1/4 of it but I couldn't go on. I would rather be reading my own 'so many books, so little time'"
3,Don't Make Too Much Out of It,"Being a book lover, of course the title & jacket cover intrigued me. While at times I had to remind myself to stick with it, it is definitely entertaining in spots. I enjoyed her take on being an avid reader; the escapism, double-booking, having the courage to quit reading, and the consequences experienced when loaned books by friends. Yes, sometimes I glossed over her descriptions of her life in NYC and I am unlikely to read most of the books she did. And I don't read 'status' books & do occasionally read 'sap'. But this was an enjoyable read and was fun to discuss with my (voracious reader) friend after she read it."
2,What a disappointment!,"I wanted this book from the moment I heard about it, and it was on my wishlist until it came out in paperback. Good thing, because I would really be upset if I'd paid hardcover prices for it. The title describes my feelings, I'm like a kid in a candystore when I'm in a bookstore or on Amazon. I figured I'd get lots of ideas from the author on great books to add to my ever-growing list of must-reads. Instead I found this book to be dull and self-involved. I'm really not interested in the author's marriage or childhood or family life. I thought she spent much more time denigrating books and authors than praising them. Sure, there are a lot of books out there that aren't worth reading, but I don't want to read about them. I also don't want to read about the unpublished manuscripts that she has access to and I don't. I thought this book would be like getting a year's worth of great book recommendations from a friend - it wasn't."
2,A Good Resource for Books,"My attention waned while reading this book. I became very bored with her life stories and found myself skipping ahead only to read the blurbs regarding what books she had read and her reviews of them. By the end of the book, I ended up with a list of 41 books I want to check out. :) So if you're stuck in the what-do-i-read-next mode, than this is a good place to get some ideas."
2,Skip this ...,"... if you prefer to invest your own time reading/thinking about your own books, vs someone else's. On the Feb 27th entry of this year-long book, the author writes that she gives herself permission to opt-out of the ""clean plate club -- that is, that she needn't finish a book that mid-way, she finds uninteresting. I made it to March 22 and then, yes, opted out."
1,Too much of nothing,"This is not a book about books. It is a book about the author, who isn't nearly as interesting as she thinks she is. This book would be much easier to take had Sarah Nelson written it as a straight autobiography.It's not that hard a job to read a book a week, especially if you don't read anything demanding like history, biography, classics, drama, poetry. Sarah Nelson tries to make her year-long effort sound rough and admirable. This book is neither.Maybe she should join the Peace Corps."
1,Follow the title's advice....,"Trying not to be too mean and too dismissive in this review, I'd say the best advice I can give people is to follow the book's title, and skip this one. In a world where there truly are too many books, too little time, there are many books more worth your time. While not exactly badly written, I can't see how this book could be wholly enjoyed without agreeing with every one of the author's opinions, which I think, opinion being so diverse, would be rare-- but perhaps what bothered me the most, aside from so much of her opinion without much depth, is the almost ""status-symbol"" way in which, as another reviwer mentions, she describes certian books as ""must-reads"" because you ""have to"" or ""everyone is reading it."""
5,A delight!,"I'm so glad somebody finally said what reviewers never say about books: that we're all influenced by reviews, and other people's opinions and hype. Sara Nelson has written a book that tells the truth -- whether you want to hear it or not. And that, to my mind, is pretty great."
4,What next?,"I first read this book a few years ago and found all sorts of suggestions for my next read. Since then, I've dipped back into the book a few times, and each time I find something more to read. I think the author's style is breezy and amusing, and I enjoyed this fun, fast read."
2,A disappointing purhcase,"I heard of this book through my sister and thought that it would be so very perfect for a readaholic like me. Also, since I keep a book list, I thought it would be a great way for me to discover titles to add to my list. The book was OK. Her truths into books/reading/readers were all truths I could relate to - so I enjoyed reading about that. But I was surprised at how boring her discussion of the books she read was. And how can there be another person who adores books as much as me, yet continously discuss books I never heard of and never want to hear of again?"
2,Doesn't work with Vista.,"Nice recorder, but they neglect to mention in the website regarding the product that *it doesn't work with Vista*. So I bought this recorder 3 months ago, and then got a new Vista laptop. Now I have to buy another recorder. I""m not very happy about this, since neither Amazon nor Olympus mentioned this very relevant detail."
4,completely impressed for the price,"I purchased the refurbished models of the 4100PC for about $[...] shipped on Amazon.com and I'm impressed. The unit works great and has all the features I need. Works great and like new for a refurb. Has Olympus 90-day warranty as well. This is a mono recorder, so if you listen via headphones you get sound out of one side. They have stereo voice recorders but are higher priced.1- USB port for easy transfers to PC2- Time stamps and folders for organization3- 12 hour recording time on XHQ (highest quality recording)4- Voice activated recording, so it starts recording when you start speaking."
4,Not my old Olympus recorder,"No more time limits. No more tape flips. No more tape breaks. No more tapes !!No more cobbled PC cables to transfer info to my computer. I haven't used it much yet, but it seems to do a fantastic job, and it cost about what my Olympus Micro 37 cost over 10 years ago."
5,Great Value,"What a great value! I've purchased cassette tape recorders that were almost the same price as this digital voice recorder. It's simple to use, compact, and works well."
2,Not if you have a Macintosh,"The quality of the recorder is fair, but not great. Transfer speed/quality is okay. Will not recognize Mac OS 10, so I have to switch my Mac to Windows mode, download the files and then switch back. The Mac has no problem playing the downloaded files."
2,Caution: It's magnetized!,"Pros: Captures sound well. Lots of space.Cons: No means to move files off device. Only 3 speeds to play back. The ""fast"" pace is still a bit slow for me. The device contains a magnet! You can't store this in your pocket, briefcase or backpack near your credit cards, USB drives or laptop!"
4,School Use,I gave this to my daughter-in-law as a present. She is a teacher and uses at school for notes and also to tape children learning to read...they hear themselves and correct mistakes. Carol
4,Good product....,"I bought this product for taking notes in class I was amazed on the quality of sound and pick up. Hooking up to ones pc can be a bit challenging I recommend reading all the instructions thoroughly then precede overall excellent product easy to use, great quality, highly recommend."
3,OK for the $$$,"The quality was good, my only drawback is that it didn't accept files from the PC. It will send files TO the PC, but not accept them FROM the PC. Therefore I sent mine back and upgraded"
3,Perhaps a better description by the manufacturer would prevent my mistake,"First, let me say that I didn't look for these features because I didn't know to do so. I am disappointed that I can't listen to the recording as it is being recorded through the earphones. I am also disappointed that the playback is mono instead of stereo. These omissions in my research have left me a disappointed in the product for my purposes. As I said, I didn't know to search for these features, assuming that everything is played back in stereo these days. As you can tell, I am not a ""techy"", and I have paid the price. I will need another recorder to truly meet my needs. Perhaps these limitations should be listed in the manufacturers descriptions of the product so those of us who need the other features could make better purchasing decisions."
1,Not PC friendly... Slow... Clunky software... Not Mac compatible...,"This unit does a poor job of transferring files to a PC. It is a bit slow transferring files. Takes about a full minute or two to transfer a 10 minute recording. Unlike many other similar USB devices, this one does not allow you to access it as a removable USB drive. You can install the drivers but there is no way to access the unit to copy the files directly from the unit. You have to install and use the slow and clunky software. As a stand alone unit it works fine and for that I would have given it a higher rating. However, this unit is specifically marketed as a PC unit and for use with a PC it is a poor choice due to the clunky and slow method to transfer files from the unit. It also is not Mac compatible at all. For the price I'd give it 4 stars if it was not for use with a PC. If you plan to use it with a PC it is a 1 to 2 star unit."
4,Good product,"The recorder is small, easy to use, and can pick up sounds from far away surprisingly well. That's good for when you're sitting far from the professor in a lecture hall but might not be so great if you're worried about background noise. Also, it's nice that the recorder is light but it feels too light. I'm afraid of shattering it if I accidentally drop it."
5,Wife loves it,"Got this recorder for the wife. She attends meetings/lectures and wanted a way to be able to listen later to gather more info. This is used in group settings and works great. Can hear both the leader and people asking questions. Easy to use. She has a hard time with new electronic equipment, but took to this with minimum of problems."
1,Don't buy it from Office Deport!,"I order the VN4100PC from this web page. But the actually model office deport delivered is VN4100, the model without PC link. And their customer service refuse to corrected the mistake when I called. I have to return the order. BAD buying experience!"
2,Olympus Digital Recorder,Product was not as expected. Case was thin plastic. Complicated for over 50's crowd to use. I was looking for something that is not complicated but most all digital recorders seem to be.
1,Does not support 64 bit Vista,"It's a shame that this thing doesn't have software/drivers compatable with 64 bit OS, but still offered to be sold here."
5,Great!!,Easy to use and records every nice and clear. The only problem I had was getting the files from the recorder to the computer. But once you read the little manual everything is fine.
2,Olympus VN-4100PC Digital Voice Recorder,"One buys this particular product for TWO reasons: ease of use in acquiring the data/voices and ease of use in transferring files. The latter is woefully UNEXPLAINED my the maker, and hence the low rating. Unless you ARE a techie guru, or enjoy searching for additional downloads to get your files off your pc/mac, stay away from this model. The applicance is easy to use and menus are fine paging through, but it's a painful learning curve getting the encrypted .wav files off your pc/mac to anything else- burning to a cd, uploading to another device, or even changing the format to something other than .wav."
3,Problem recording choral voices,"I bought this recording device hoping to be able to take it to my choral rehearsals as an aid to learning the music. During playback,I found that even having recorded with the volume mode on low, the voices and piano sounds were so shrill and distorted that I couldn't listen without cringing. I tried placing the recorder on my person as well as on the floor and got the same results on playback. This recorder picks up a single voice well and plays that back without distortion, so it would be perfect for lectures and the like. It is user friendly and has some nice features. The labels are easy to read. I like the various folders and length of recording time."
3,OK-not what I really needed.,The ADV only will stay active for an hour and then will go into sleep mode. Manual intervention is needed to wake it up again. Not useful when try to catch a cheating husband. Would not have bought if I had known.
4,Excellent Recorder,"This is an excellent, compact sized recorder. The sound quality is very good although you do have to be careful about background noise. The only problem i had was transferring the files to my computer...I have not gotten this to work as of yet"
4,Does what I want,"This is a neat little package that has a lot of capacity. The download feature is a must. Once the file is in the computer, it can be edited eliminating unnecessary content. Audio playback from the unit can be quite loud which is good for the hearing impaired. Most impressive is the ability of the built-in microphone to pickup distant voices you encounter in a conference room. I just turn it on and drop it into my shirt pocket. I haven't tried it in an auditorium but I would not be surprised to see it capture distant voices as long as ambient noise is low. I would certainly recommend this to my friends."
5,Olympus VN-4100PC Digital Voice Recorder,Great product- excellent recording and playback quality. I love the ability to file into separate folders instead of a long series of recordings that need to be played to get to the desired recording. Also the battery life and recording time are excellent especially considering the compact size and very reasonable cost.
3,"good device, poor software","I agree with most of the reviews out there, the device itself is great, but when it comes to transferring the files to the computer, it really bugs me. The only way to do it is through their proprietary software, which download the files very, very, very slowly."
3,Beware - software does not work with Windows Vista 64 bit,"I bought this voice recorder, but nowhere did it specify that the software does not work with Windows Vista 64 bit. This of course disables a very important feature of the recorder, so I just sent mine back to Amazon."
3,Product good - software bad!,"The HARDWARE product works well. I have carried it for over 6 hours at times and had it record everything. The mic is good enough to gather all local conversations and even gather to some distance (15 - 20 feet in a quiet environment). HOWEVER, the software that comes with it is horribly inadequate. Now since most would by this product for playback and wav file manipulation once the capture was complete, you would think they would enclose a better product to make the hardware more useful, but they do not. Consider the cost of a third party software product when you are considering buying this item. Also, use caution if the batteries are low. I lost all recorded files when the batteries died during use."
1,"nice unit, horrible, unsupported software for PC.","I borrowed my friend's unit VN-4100PC for my wife to do an interview. It will not download to my machine. After investigation, the FAQ suggests using Digital Wave Player 2.1+, but it was shipped with 2.0. I downloaded the update, but it doesn't update the software. So it's useless. My wife will have to work on the recording from the recorder, rather than from a transferred file on our computer.I once had an Olympus digital camera, admittedly, it was four years ago. But I had similar problems with that software. I can only conclude that Olypus doesn't do software. Or maybe they just don't know how to do it right.My Pentax camera, OTOH, has a very easy, intuitive interface. So I will probably continue to stay away from Olypus products."
2,Satisfactory,It was the wrong color than what I was supposed to receive. It said that I had a USB connection but the one I received didn't.
1,BUYER BEWARE...THIS ITEM IS A REAL CLUNKER!,"I bought the VN-4100PC recorder only two weeks ago, and I am now receiving an ""ERR"" message as a result of performing a simple task such as changing the batteries. I searched various websites for workarounds, and the one I was able to find via the web involves deleting all files in the memory. This defeats the purpose of the recording device. To this effect, it is absolutely useless. Don't buy this product. I'm sure there are better, less expensive products. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,When compared to a MP3 player this is not useful.,When I first bought Olympus voice recorder I used it for 45 days approximately and then I kept it aside. The quality of the sound was not that great and it was producing echoes. It is not crystal clear like what you get using an MP3 player. So I will recommend a good quality mp3 player to this Voice Recorder. Olympus has to make some basic changes in it's Voice Recorder.
3,Not good enough,Only one preset time recording is available and it must be reset each day.Not what I expected from the product discription.To burn a recording to a CD is far nor hassel than the thing is worth.I returned the product and eat the shipping.
5,Fantastic Recorder,"This digital voice recorder is excellent. it's a fantastic price for all that you get. It's very easy to use and the directions are easy to understand. It's much smaller and lighter than i expected it to be. The mic being on top of the recorder makes it perfect to carry around in my purse, or in a pocket if i have one in front. The array of accessories that you can use with this make it very versatile. The buttons are nicely spread out (not all in the same spot) and easy to use even when not looking directly at the recorder. i highly recommend this recorder especially since you are able to link to a PC."
2,Can't copy to music CD,"I purchased this recorder for my wife to read stories for the grandkids. The plan was to copy the stories to a music cd for them to play in a cd player. After pulling my hair out, I discovered the following statement on the Olympus website:""Audio files from VN Series digital voice recorders cannot be saved to an audio CD for playback in a music player."""
3,"Solid voice recorder, does not work with OSX, not plug and play/drag and drop","Solid voice recorder. does what it needs to with good enough quality. however, you can only transfer audio files with bundled software. would be 4 stars if it showed up as a flash drive when connected in which you could drag and drop folders to your hard drive to import. Also software isnt compatible with OSX which is something that is no longer acceptable with the growing popularity of macs. Folder set up is also a little confusing"
2,"Mac users, be aware that this DVR does not work with Macs","I bought this because I thought it was the same DVR I use at my university. However, it clearly is not the same one, because even though it has a USB connection, it doesn't work with Macs for some reason. This was so disappointing (especially because I found out AFTER I had recorded a two-hour interview that I needed to transcribe for a research class).I like the recording quality - the mic picks everything up really well. Also, this model has plenty of space for hours and hours of recording. It's also easy to use. Of course, all of that won't do you much good if you need to get the audio files onto your Mac - so I'd recommend this only if you have a Windows-based computer. But really, this product is flawed because it ought to work on any computer, so I'm giving it two stars for that reason."
1,Don't order this item from amazon!!,I ordered the vn4100pc and received the vn4100. Had to make multiple calls to resolve (and hopefully I will get the credit as promised)buyer beware!!
4,Great voice recorder,Fantastic value- nobody has billed me for it yet!I called the seller and they said billing is by Amazon. Amazon are really hard to get through to.
4,folders,"I suspect I am just not used to folders. However it does pick up a good voice level. I tried in a Tai Chi saber workshop last week to use in a pocket, to record the instructor it was muffled. Best used in the open which I did do today in recording the saber steps. So - only one folder was needed.Will study the folders more."
5,"Cheap, excellent qaulity","Spoken words record and sound excellent. Little backgournd noise. Recording spir of the moment music sessions, like with my guitar, not so great. Still a handy and easy to use recorder with USB. Worth the price!"
4,great!!! but not perfect,"This is so far the best (cheap) sound recorder I have had. It does what it is suppose to. The menus are easy to navigate and if you read the manual you can find the perfect settings for recording in any situation. the only thing I have to say would that would be negative would be that when I plug in the headphones to listen to my recordings, only the left earbud works. This also happened when I plugged them into my home speakers. With that said, its a pretty decent machine. Software is a bit slow for my taste."
2,Cannot edit recording,"Beware, if recorder is thoughtto be on hold and it isn't, you can wind up with hours of undesired recording. Must purchase adio editing software to clean this up. Otherwise a great recorder."
1,software and support awful,"Amazingly poor software support and Olympus actually wants you to buy a new CD if you misplace your install disk, yet won't sell the CD. Wow. unbelievable."
3,pretty good,"iI really liked this product and it was good for the price. except it didnt have a usb cable so i bought another one, and the other one came with a wave sysstem, which is a must have for a ghost hunter like myself."
2,So-so product,"I bought this for taking notes in the field which I would later edit, so that connecting to a computer was not an issue and neither was fidelity. After learning to use it I took it on an 8 day trip in the woods; when I got back, I could not retrieve my data. I sent it to Olympus and they said they could fix it for $40 and I would probably get my data back. The data was worth it, so I gave them the go ahead. When I got it back, it was fixed but my data was lost. Evidently this happened because I did not replace the battery as soon as the ""battery low"" sign appeared. This seems to me to be a pretty serious design flaw."
4,Good,"A book that deals with sexual disorders in a very professional and sober way. Medics here take all the problems that a man might have and detail them into very long explanations for each sexual problem. A great book for medics and people that like hard facts, [...]"
1,Review,I ordered the Brett Favre jersey in size 48. When I received the jersey it was a size 48 but it was too large to be that size. My only complain is that they should have the correct size and offer prepaid shipping labels to return so that you don't have to use your own money to send it back.Thanks!
2,Cloth soles,"They are attractive and warm. They must be hand washed and don't appear to be very durable, but likely I will still get $5 worth of use."
1,primitive footwear,"No difference between right and left slipper, so they don't shape to the foot at all."
4,"Easy to use, move and store","Why use ladders when you can get something better? This platform is strong and stable, yet folds with little effort for carrying or storing. It's versatile, too- use for home projects and (with a pad) as an exercise bench or temporary seating. The plywood platform has a roughened coating to provide sure footing, but it's not splintery or sharp. The metal platform skirt and edge do have a couple of places where the metal could snag bare or sensitive skin, so pad those or wear your work clothes when you use. (always a good idea! <G>). If not for that I would have given 5 stars. All in all a great value for a great tool."
4,6 year old daughter loved it.,"Our 6 year old started playing it and did not stop until she had finished the game. She enjoyed it and building on each game to win a reward at the end. The only concern is that now that she has been through it once, she is not as interested now. Overall, I gave it 4 stars because we have had several games in the past where she never got past 10 minutes before being bored."
2,Nothing new here,"There is no new research inherent in this book, simply a meandering assortment of previously-published information. If you know nothing about the Lincoln assassination, it might be okay, but there are far better researched, and better-written books on the subject, notably Michael Kauffman's American Brutus or various books by Ed Steers. Of course, you could always dive down to the level of Bill O'Reilly's version."
4,Good read,"I found it a interesting read, particularly in the way the author elaborated on the actions of the Confederate Secret Service and the personal dynamics between Lincoln and his associates.There's a lot of good information, but the ending is a bit stark. It finishes up like a term paper. I would have preferred the author extrapolate on his findings a little further. But I like opinionated authors."
5,Best $25 I have ever spent!,"Received the part in a huge box , but the mirror fits on my 2004 Toyota Corolla LE (Silver). The part is black as pictured. Used youtube video ""How To Install Replace Broken Side Rear View Mirror Toyota Corolla 03-08 1AAuto.com "" to figure out how to install the darn thing and it works!"
3,good,we use this item and it should be perfect for my car. coast is good and easy to install. when I go to shop for estimate they give me about $600.00 to complete the job but i order on line coast is $40.00 and install my self.
1,Just about worthless,The Tioga Spyder saddle is just about worthless because its webbing breaks in the first 600 miles.The saddle is comfortable but its lifespan is so short as to make it a joke.Tioga has no customer service department and the bike shops selling this item will not replace it or make a refund.I weigh 150 and have broken 2 saddles.
2,If you are interested in Evidence Read more,"Science on Trial is likely the widest used book in Colleges today on evolution, but If you really are wanting to discover the evidence for or against evolution then I would recommend a book that changed the way well know scientist such as Phil Johnson and Michael Behe view this theory. It is the book ""Evolution: A Theory in Crisis"" by Michael Denton. Remember Science means with knowledge and in order to gain knowledge we must look at the evidences so we can come to a logical conclusion."
2,Lacking in narration,"This book did deal with some very good matters, but I felt it was much too heavy reading. It continues to hit you with fact after fact and never gives time for it to sink in before hitting you with another fact. It proved a rather boring read, but with better narration would be a really good book."
1,"Futuyma's ""Science on Trial"" Doesn't Pass the 'Facts' Test","This 1995 Edition is similar to the 1983 version. A serious science researcher should not waste good money on this book - it cannot be considered a serious, reliable scientific reference. It is a great disappointment in scholarship, little more than a screedy, anti-Christian diatribe, railing against Creationists who dare think that Evolution is not good science. Particularly, his addressing of the Second Law of Thermodynamics is wide of the mark, just flat erroneous. Much of Futuyma's book is replete with combative language about Christians who embrace Creation. His inflammatory language only serves the notion that this book is not about science, but about philosophy. His scholarship about the Bible is particularly deficient."
2,Not Useful at All,"Recently purchased the 4th Edition and found the pullout maps to be useless. The text is printed in an incredibly small font. I purchased this book without seeing it first based on experience with past Lonely Planet books. Never again. Outside of some interesting history, I found little useful about this city guide. I was better served with a map provided by the hotel and what information I could gather from the hotel concierge (from a hotel not listed in LP guide book). LP city guides seem focused on low budget travel alone. I am shifting to Frommer's."
3,not great,"I always use Lonely Planet guides when I travel. This particular guide for Budapest was disappointing. The information is there - good maps, but it's not written in the usual engaging style. It's quite dry and boring, and did not inspire me to visit places. Budapest has much more to offer than what's presented in this book."
3,Not as good as the Best Of series,"Lonely Planet normally does great guide books, but this one was lacking. We go to European cities to see the sights and sample the food and the culture. There are too many pages devoted to shopping, drinking, nightlife, and sports & activities. There's a map you can tear out of the back, but it's not nearly as useful as the fold-out ones you find in the ""Best of"" series. On a positive note, we did find the info about using the public transport system useful, but had to pick up local maps to find our way around. We would have bought the Best Of version, but it wasn't available on the UK site (we live in France), so took a gamble on this one. Get the Best Of book instead or pick Rick Steve's book."
2,Disappointing Lonely Planet Guide,"This book is very disappointing for a Lonely Planet Guide. There is very little detail about what to see and do with more emphasis on places to eat and stay. If I had looked at it in a bookstore first, I never would have purchased it.While the book says top sights with full detail it is really superficial.Look at other Budapest guides before purchasing this one."
3,comment on content,I do not have the knowledge of 17th/18th century museum quality furniture to properly rate this book. I just want to comment on the very misleading assurtion that this book covers furniture styles up to the present - unless you consider one 1961 furniture company ad and a photo of a Stickley bookcase as proper coverage of 20th century american furniture.
2,Nice Design ... Poor Quality,"The socks fit well, and their design is often commented on favorably. But they are poorly made (turn them inside out for evidence of this), and they arrived with plasticmerchandising hooks punched through them, leaving holes that within a week were large enough to make them unwearable. I doubt I'll be purchasing these again."
5,This Bible deserved better . . .,"This Bible desereved better than its sales demonstrated. The New Living Translation text was applied by statements of faith, drawn directly from the Scriptures, placed in the margin. I enjoyed highlighting those affirmations which I could truly claim. For example, the text of Eph 4:29 reads, ""Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them."" The affirmation says ""I speak what is good and helpful, not foul and abusive."" Well done, Tyndale!"
4,New Living Translation,"some positive notes along the side, sharing a perspective of someone who would be responding to the passage, just saying ""I believe that"" etc. i think it sorta... partners along in the reading."
3,slightly impressed,THIS CD IS OK BUT ITS NOWHERE NEAR THE BLOCK IS HOT. THE FOLLOWUP SINGLE IS OFF THE CHAIN PLUS A COUPLE OF OTHER SONGS. HE NEEDED BETTER BEATS CAUSE I BELIEVE FRESH COULD HAVE DID BETTER. ITS WORTH COPPING THOUGH.
3,Modest,"The sophomore album from Lil Wayne finds the youngest Hot Boy taking things a little more seriously than he did the first time round. Granted, there is no thematic consistency to this album, both the lyrics and production are considerably tighter. Part of what gives the album its charm is Wayne's awareness-both of his society and of his own responsibilities. ""Grown Man"" and ""Wish you Would"" are surprisingly mature tracks, the like of which were sadly missing on Tha Block is Hot.Still, it is hard to ignore the fact that Lil Wayne and his associates have made a resoundingly safe album. Whereas B.G. opted for a grittier sound on his album Checkmate(released simultaneously), Lil Wayne doesn't seem to have quite enough confidence in his ability to carry an album. Thus, there are plenty of appearances from the Hot Boys and Big Tymers, and as such, the album fails to make the same impression that Wayne would later on with his Carter albums."
4,Lights Out,"I feel that Lil' Wayne's second solo project is by far a whole lot better than first one, ""Tha Block Is Hot"". He and the Cash Money Millionaires did an exceptional job on the beats because they truly thump in your CD player. Lil' Wayne raps from the bottom of his heart especially when he pays tribute to his father. If you're like me and you consider yourself a true fan of CMB, go pick up Lil' Wayne's ""Lights Out""."
1,If it starts with Lil' I don't want to hear it....,"How original.... there is Lil' Wayne, Lil Zane, Lil Bow Wow, Lil Kim, Lil Romeo, and a who knows how many more talentless MCs out there. I pray for hip-hop, a once intelligent, original scene that is now a pile of donkey manure."
3,not his best,"In my opinion Wayne is the best CashMoney has going these days but this album is his worst, not to say its a bad album just not the best i've heard from him, Tha Block Is Hot being the best, then 500 Degreez, The Carter, and finally this Lights Out. I love Wayne's delivery on all his albums but with only a handful of good tracks on this one it isnt as impressive but still worth a listen."
2,uhh....what the ...,"This is the sorriest album I've ever heard by Cash Money. U will be thinkin what was Mannie Fresh thinkin with the beats he laced Lil Wayne wit. I warn U do not touch this cd. I am a TRU Cash Money fan too, to me this was a real dissapointment. All the other Cash Money cds are tight tho."
4,LIL WEEZY IZ BACK,"The first time I heard this cd I thought it was a waste of my money , but I kept listenin to it and now its one of my favorite cds . Lil Wayne has grown up alot since The Block Is Hot . On this album he shows it on songs like F**k Wit Me Now ,Grown Man , and Everything . I like every song on here but Lil One with Baby . That song is wack but other than that Lights Out is a Dope Cd . I cant wait til Weezy comes out with another album !"
5,This record is tight,"I frist heard the Lil' Wayne song ""get off the corner"" and really liked it. So I bought the CD expecting it to have a few good songs. Turns out it is now my fav cd in my collection. Other good songs are ""Shine"" and ""Jump Jiggy"" but there are many more, and i strongly suggest that you pick this one up."
1,CASH MONEY IS DEAD-,Yo Yo-I'm the biggest cash money fan- but this CD is wack-Weak Weak-DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM-This album is a waste of wax and your 16 buck don't buy this crap-CASH MONEY IS DEAD-
2,WAYNE IS ANNOYING,as always cash moneys beats are ill but waynes voice is horrible. i cant stand listening to hear this kid sqeek. bg is the dopest out of cash money. word
3,poor shipment,"This item is exactly as i ordered it. but it took forever to make it to my house. i had to reorder this item because it got lost some how. i was more upset at the fact that amazon only refunded me for a portion of my purchase and did not give me any reason as to why my package was ""undeliverable"". i was not pleased with this process at all."
1,Pulseware Mini by Highgear,"I was so excited about this item. I wore it for less than 6 months and then it began to fade out, give bogus readings...but I must tell you that Highgear is trying to keep me happy. They replace my Pulseware again and again. I am on my third one, and yes, I will give it another try."
3,Heart Rate Wrist Monitor,"The watch looks nice, but when you're wearing it while exercising it's difficult to get a read on your blood pressure. I'll press down on both buttons, and there is no read out. It works fine when I'm just standing, but once you're on the go whether walking or jogging it doesn't work that well."
1,misleading,this is the product picture this is what i odered and its not what i recieved i got a container with no handle as shown here and no lid ridiculous and to top it off they charge altogether almost $8 dollars for shipping never again!
3,"Ok, but could be better for the price","I am a computer repair tech in PA for 20 years. If using this set for computer repair,this set does not have enough of the different tips needed (torx, phillips, etc.) for the different screw heads that are found on most newer and older PC's. You should check this first to see what applications you are working on. I am unsure of what this set is best used for at the price it is listed at. A $50.00 set may be more matched for PC repair work in my experience."
1,Like watching paint dry,"It is not worth the money! It is not even a proper book, more like a pamphlet with a stiff paper cover. I would have returned it but couldn't be bothered with the long process Amazon puts you through. I tried very hard to read through it and gave up half way through. Maybe I am not enough of an academic to understand what Crowley was trying to say, or maybe its just pretentious nonsense maskarading as a great literary work! It should be retitled 'An essay on wasting your hard earned cash'."
3,It's ok.,"I love Southern everything. Wanted to cook some authentic dishes, this was ok... I tried a few, thengot bored, not exactly super... not bad, but no stars in my eyes."
4,Great cook book,"Great cook book and My wife says for you to look for a COUNTRY COOKING recipe book on here by Pattie Hensley. My wife says both are two of the best country cooking recipe books out here. We saw Pattie Hensley and Her Husband, Douglas Hensley, who also writes books, on a morning TV show. I have seen Mr. Douglas Hensley on many TV paranormal TV shows such as Sightings, Encounters, and many more. Contrary to what HARDLUCK says read all my reviews. I am not telling anyone to buy any book, just stating my opinion on what my wife and I like."
4,review of the handsfree corded stereo earbud set for cellular,This product is working well so far. I also purchased one for my home cordless phone and it has been working flawlessly so far. It's been about a month so far and I am pleased with the reception and the mic seems to work well too on both phones. I would recommend this product for the price that I payed for the first one that I bought 3 years ago I could have purchaced eight fron this company on Amazon [...].
3,You get what you pay for,I bought this item for my mom and only one side of the earphone worked. Guess you get what you pay for. Enough said
1,Not worth it,I got these earbuds for Moto Q. The fit is poor unless you have huge ear canal. They are big and hard. So trying to get them to stay in your ear is difficult. If you can get them to stay the output level is weak. I tried to use these on a flight and I could barely hear anything. A better solution is to get an adapter and use your favorite earbuds.
4,moto headset,"Stereo quality sound is great. It arrived in 3 shipping days. No fancy labeled packaging, no warranty books or safety info. regarding frequency, waves, etc. Don't know how safe this thing is on my head. Ear plugs are a little large and uncomfortable. Overall, the sound is great and the microphone is excellent placing calls. Don't have to yell."
5,A story for modern times,This is a timeless story. What led to the disaster that caused a U. S. Navy ship to be captured and still be on display in N. Korea is a lesson the U. S. Government has yet to learn.
3,moderately helpful,"My pleasure in the book was minimized when I came to the sections on telemarketing, etc. . . not what I expected. The portions of the book that were helpful, were A-1."
5,I know the place,"Jeff Conine's second book is a tragic story of love complicated by two other characters, one that overwhelms - the rugged and dangerous area where the ocean meets land - the second who lirks close at hand - the demon of alcohol. True literature. Take a breath, submerge, then read on. I await the surprise of his third book."
5,D.R. Smith,Jeff Conine has written a dark review of just how bad an alcoholic's relationships can be.Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see just how bad this guy can screw up the the attachments between himself and his Significant Other. Sure to become a 'self help group' classic!
3,Eh...,This was recommended to me by Amazon because of Trophy Scars. This was just all right for me. I can't say that it was terrible because they aren't exactly a ripoff of everything else but at the same time there wasn't anything to make them special. It's a good idea to listen to some of the songs before you buy this.
4,First watch in years,"Watch is great for everyday casual wear. I bought it for the sportiness and the additional features that are helpful as a traveler, a runner, and a hiker. My only issues are that the wrist band holds so well that sometimes I struggle to get the watch off and also, I have yet to program the compass and feel confident that its correct because I have gotten varied results. To the watch's credit, I think its more user error than issues with the device."
3,Sent me the wrong colour,"Not used yet, but they sent me the grey one instead of the orange one I ordered. Would've returned it, but the husband did not mind the colour and it would've been a hassle and more shipment money.Would've liked more contrast between the interface and the numbers though."
4,Best I've read in the series.,"Admittedly the only other book I've read in the McMorrow series was Borderline, and that was good enough to get me to try ""Potshot"". The basic premise at the beginning, Jack is hired to write an article reagarding the legalization of pot, is interesting enough to keep you reading and it just builds from there. The introduction of the hard to figure characters Bobby and Coyote, and the very surprising characters of Melanie and Steven helped make this a real page turner. I thought the story was fun to read and when it came down to the last 75 pages or so, I couldn't put it down. So much for the ""noble"" (depending on your viewpoint), idea of legalizing pot. A real surprise ending!"
4,Fantastic !!,My wife loves it mainly because she used to lose our old cordless phone in our 2 story house. The dual handset works perfectly for us. The features we love 1) dual handsets 2) speaker on both the handsets (my wife uses it while in the kitchen) and now the kids and us can all talk to grandma 3) clear clear reception 4) answering machine with time stamp 5) Voice enhancer is amazing! 6) phone bookWhy not 5 stars ? We've been using it for only 2 weeks now and didn't get to use all the features yet.
1,Dead after 3 months,"I was actually quite happy with the phone regarding features and reception, until this week! Realizing that I have not heard the phone ring for a couple(?) of days, I glanced at the base unit to see if everything was alright. There I spied no lights at all glowing. I checked the outlet for power, and then the power transformer from the phone- both were working fine. Re-read the instruction manual for any reset tips, but the base unit was dead. I have 3 other Panasonic phones in the house, but this model is the first dud I have ever had from this company."
1,Terrible reception,"We bought this phone system knowing that Panasonic is a decent brand, but were completely disappointed. The phones have a terrible static noise and calls fade in/out. I looked in the manual for troubleshooting tips and it suggested moving the phones away from other electric devices, which I did, but it didn't help at all.What good are all the other great features if the basic reception is not there?"
5,wheres the phone,2 phones was what my inlaws needed and they are very happy with them. My wife and i own panasonics also.panasonic is the best when it comes to cordless phones
4,Does the job,"Made of a sturdy plastic, the receptacles accept 2X4s easily. Assembly is straightfoward. Delivery was quick. One caveat: it takes two kits to build the double-level rack shown in the photograph."
4,Works as advertised,"The product works as advertised. I bought 2 sets, so that I could build a 2 level rack. This is really the only way to build the rack. It would be too unsteady with just one level. With the 2 levels, it is very stable. I followed the instructions, except that I used 3"" deck screws (not included) to fasten the vertical 2x4's to the horizontal 2x4's on the bottom rack. This gave a little more stability. The rack works good and is very cheap to make."
1,Finley 2X4 Firewood Stacker,"I was quite disappointed in this item. Although it was difficult to tell from the photos provided, when I received it I discovered what I consider to be a big design flaw. I used 8 ft. 2X4's for the length of the rack. The 2X4's are laid flat and there is no other option. They would have been much stronger had they been turned on edge. The same is true for the end 2X4's. As a result your stack will sag in the middle and will lean out on the ends. If you are not careful the stress on the ends will break the 2X4's. I would not recommend this product unless you are going to make your rack very small (3 to 4 ft. long). It is not for a serious stack of wood."
3,"Does the job, but does not dazzle","What can you expect from 12 bucks worth of recycled plastic? I guess I'd gone and expected something a little more sturdy and ingenious, and while I was satisfied I was not impressed with what I got. This is simply a couple of plastic brackets that will allow sets of 2x4s to form whatever structure you're building. It'll do the job, but nothing more.Note that this is simply two (2) of the exact same brackets that you can buy in a six pack (6) at lower cost from Finley."
1,Wouldn't buy from Ace Hardware Outlet again,"This product is sold by Ace Hardware Outlet and was originally listed with a different picture. When my order arrived it was not what was described in the picture. Ace agreed to refund the cost of the product but not the shipping charges which meant I have to pay for their mistake. That's ""bad business"" and I won't purchase from them again. They've since corrected the picture.As for the Wood's product itself, it's rather bulky and made of light weight plastic. I would not recommend it for lightning or surge protection. I had placed my order based on a protector that I already own and was expecting something much better. Now looking back, I remember I paid three times more than the cost of the 6915 for my old one. I've since ordered different surge protectors made by Belkin and APC. If you trully wish to protect your equipment, I would recommend one of these two Manufacturers."
1,Disappointed,"On installation, the phonics module wouldn't install (the error message said the installation file for that module was corrupt). Then, several of the modules would not play correctly - they kept demanding that I insert the CD even though it was already in the drive). Also, I was displeased to find that this is not one integrated product, but rather several unrelated programs all crammed onto one DVD."
1,not what I expected,There's no real improvement from two years ago. The games are too game-like and provide no real scholastic benefit. My son felt the games were too young for him and he's 9. He said the games were boring.
1,I scowled all the way through the book,"Normally, I don't review books because I tend to agree to at least one review that's already been written. But, I HAD to review this time. I've just discovered Michelle Reid books and have enjoyed the handful I've read so far, but this one was a disappointment. The Hero was an ass and a bully and the heroine let her horniness overrule her brain EVERY TIME. Every time she got fed up and decided to leave him for good, I cheered her on because I knew it would make him really examine his behavior. And every time he would bully or sexually manipulate her into giving him to him and I would groan and roll my eyes. By the time the end rolled around and resolutions were happening, I was so over everything, I didn't care. I'll read more Michelle Reid books because I've seen how awesome they can be, but I'm glad this wasn't the first book of hers that I read."
1,oh the pain,i cried the whole way through. It was just TOO horrible. Basically H uses h and always puts his family before her. And she falls into his powerful arms whenever she tries to take a stand. Sorry H did not appeal to me at all and heroine should have moved on with her life. Normally i like the whole alpha male beat on chest but this guy had me reaching for the prozac
3,Holmes and Watson ride again,"The story begins with a visit from Sir Henry Irving a very accomplished actor of the British stage. He is starring in a production of Bram Stoker's Dracula, which had just been recently been published. It seems that a murder has taken place, and the body when found had two puncture marks on the neck and was seemingly drained of all blood, leaving behind a definite pallor. The death (and some more soon to follow) cause a problem for Sir Henry as some people are unable to separate in the minds the distinction between the killer and the role Sir Henry is currently playing. Holmes and Watson have to come to the rescue and find out what's really going on here.This one was a bit better than some of the other Andrews pastiches, so it was actually a pretty nice read. If you are considering any of Andrews' Holmes stories, this one wouldn't be a bad place to start."
1,The worst,I switched from the littermaid to this and I am soooooo sorry I did...for as frustrating as I may have found the littermaid this is SO MUCH WORSE! It never (except for the first swipe) gets the clumps up so when it begins its return it drags it all with it and then gets caught up behind where it will not work... If I could give you ANY advice it would be NOT to buy this...
1,Disappointed,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. I have used about three littermaid self cleaning pans over the last 5 years, and thought that this would be an improvement. Although it claims to have ""fixed"" the littermaid's well documented shortcomings, I have concluded that it is not really an improvement, and costs twice as much. My only addition to the other reviewer's comments is that the overall build quality is not high."
1,My cats and I hate it!,"Total junk. Save your money. More trouble than it's worth. My cats tried it but now refuse to use it.I've had the unit for 3 months. I contacted the company and asked nicely for them to refund my money since it has been too long for the retailer to take it back. The manufacturer would only offer to replace it under the 1 yr. warranty policy. Since I really don't want the thing in my house any more replacing it with another unit isn't going to do me any good. I'd much rather have my money back, but it looks like that's not going to happen.Botton line: Save your money and stick with manual scoop boxes."
1,Petmate Purrforma Litterbox Literally Stinks!!,"Worst purchase I have ever made. My old Littermaid self-cleaning cat box finally died & I unfortunately chose to try the Petmate brand. It's underpowered, runs very slowly, spaces on rake are too far apart & too thin. Rake also needs to either be angled differently or stop closer to dumping container. Always leaves stinking dirty litter at front & cats have to step in it to get into box. Have tried numerous premium litters but machine still stalls out easily. An awkward, stinking mess to clean this machine even when used properly. I don't like it & neither do the cats."
4,Very enlightening,"Perfect for the person who grew up in a traditional family (Dad works, Mom raises the kids), probably more than ok for the rest as well. Sam explains several key aspects of the Father/Son relationship that were really helpful to me. A couple, of the many, examples would be: like why we see our bosses the way we do in relation to our relationship with our father, how Dad's relationship to Mom changed when the family started, and why our Fathers saw us the way they did. Plenty of good, without being overdone, aspects of our relationship with our Mothers as well. I felt the book strayed at some points just far enough from the title that it warranted 4 stars instead of 5; like when he discusses in detail some of the failed attempts he and his wife had at having children. The close is strong as he suggests how to heal those wounds we have with our Dads."
5,Excellent,Absolutely excellent. Many works of this subject matter spew forth psychobabble and contain nothing useful or substantial. This book rocks.
4,very cute!,"I got this book from my friend who knows i'm so in love with lance, and it is so adorable, with cute little facts and pictures, but it was so short, i wish there were more pictures, and also, the facts included, mostly were facts we've all heard a million times before. But it's about lance, and it's a cute little book and it's great to drool over lance and be able to take him with you wherever you go!"
2,Not worth the money,"Now, I love 'N Sync as much as the next fanatic, but I mustadmit after receiving this book, I felt a little...gipped. It isextremely small, not to mention short. It is filled with pictures we've all seen a million times. The facts and pictures are completly outdated, and the book is smaller then your hand. I suppose that would make it ""cute and tiny"" but I'd rather spend my 5 bucks plus S&H on something bigger, better, and frankly, worth my money."
5,Lightweight knife,I open the box and the knife was sharp enough to shave my arm. :) I have carried a heavy Gerber for years and I wanted something lighter. So far so good.
5,Perfect stacking bin for upper kitchen cupboards,I got these to hold my k-cups and they are absolutely pefect for the job. Very well made. I might get more for other cupboards since I liked them so much :)
4,It's how music should be.....fun!!!,"From the fire of ""miles mode"" to soulful ballad, ""my one and only love"" to the goofy but understandable ""good booty and BBQ"" to the rhythm filled ""Mr. Drummerman"". This is an outstanding album with outstanding musicians!! Showing you can have great feel, with great technique, and still have fun!"
3,An Interesting Early Work,"Originally published in 1965 as half of an Ace Double, this novel was reprinted in slightly longer form, with illustrations, in a Tor Books edition in 1980.Old-fashioned space adventure features ""Planeteer"" Boris Brazil (!), visiting backwater colony planet with intelligent natives whose rituals center around a liquid with unpredictable effects on the ""earth-descended."" After another planeteer drinks the Water of Thought and goes berserk, Boris follows him into the wilderness, and ultimately learns what the water is and how it works on the native species.Short on characterization, long on action and ideas, this is a fairly entertaining early 60's potboiler; not particularly well-written but readable."
3,It's just OK,"It looks pretty on my sink but other than that, it's not too hot. The measurement marks on the pot and the ones on the side of the water reservoir do not measure the same. The ones on the reservoir are very difficult to see. I would not purchase this coffee maker again."
3,It's okay for the price.,"The coffee maker functions just fine. However the design leaves a little to be desired. The filter basket is centered between the openings for filling the water -- they are relatively narrow and a little too close to the hinge for opening the lid, making it a little cumbersome to fill the water compartments. But, it works and it was priced well."
4,Coffee maker,"We went out of our way to Get a Proctor-Silax machine because of the faster brew time. This product lives up to our expectations. It was delivered in a speedy way, too."
1,Great if you like coffee that tastes like burnt plastic!,I bought one of these yesterday and tried to make some coffee and it was DISGUSTING! The coffee tasted good but had a horrible plastic after taste that made me literally get sick. After washing everything and trying again I discovered that the part where you put the filter and coffee grounds into is made of SUPER cheap plastic... which SMELLED the way my coffee smelled... it turned my stomach... I'm returning it today and buying a better one...
1,No auto shutoff!,"Shame on me. I didn't read all the fine print. I looked as so many coffee makers and figured at $25, it would have everything it needed. Not true. No auto shutoff. Sure hope I don't have a house fire when I forget to turn it off!"
5,Brilliant,"This series has been too overlooked. I just love these. One night in Kansas, Dorothy meets Ezra P. Tinker the inventor of Tik-tok the machine man and claims the thousand year guarentee has just run down. With the help of Mister Tinker's speckoscope and Julius Quickscissors they get to Oz with the Widdlebits and Princess Astoria.This story has everything it needs to be perfect."
4,pretty cool dvd,"Its one of the best one piece dvds to come out so far. Nami and Zoro's fight is really cool.Nami did good for the first time by herself in a realfight.Zoro vs Mr.1 was just cool and Luffy vs Mr.0/Crocodile was one of the best battles so far. I'm really glad that funimation took over One Piece instead of you Know who, I'm not going to type in any names but lest just say the firt part of their name starts with a 4.when I was watching it on 4k it felt like a little kitty show. And when I watch it on my computer it was way better so when funimation took over it that was cool because One Piece is a japanese not a kitty cartoon. so now when I watch it its like im wacthing the one on my computer.Im Sorry about that enjoy the dvd thanks."
2,Be carefull,"The gloves are very very nice. But: Take care about the size... the M size it's smaller than the mizuno or anything else. I can't use it and neither my friends, it's more for a kid or youth. If your adult about 5'7"" should be see for the L or XL glove"
5,Easy and Great!,I never like to assemble furniture although I don't find it that much of a challenge most of the time. This was easier than I expected and it was shipped so well that there were no blemishes at all! I would buy another if I had room!
1,Unusable CD,Had his as an album many yrs ago and wanted it as a CD. The CD shipped was brand new but it was in a format that none of my audio CD players or PC's could play. I even gave it to someone with an audio background and he could not play this format. So basically the CD was worthless.
5,Success through failures,"The Industrial Operator's Handbook should be part of every industrial operations training program. The focus of this book is failure analysis and preventative procedures. Training, communication, the art of turnovers, and the importance of building a strong team are all covered. Employee's find the book easy to read because they can relate to the conditions that lead to accidents."
3,Product good;shipping problems,"The product arrived in good condition and was exactly what it was advertised as. However, we had numerous problems with delays in shipping. The product took a lot longer to arrive than originally promised."
3,More Unanswered Questions,"I was looking forward to this book wrapping up some of the dangling threads from The Sword/Ring/Chalice trilogy. Not only were my questions not answered, I am now left with many more dangling plotlines.I found Pheresa to be a weak, whining character who doesn't begin to buck up until almost the end of the book and is definitely not deserving of her love interest, who, by the way, is about fifty times more interesting than she is. Very disappointing, although I enjoy Chester's style. Quite disappointing for a book I was very much looking forward to."
4,Another good one from Deborah Chester...,"After finishing her Ring, Sword, and Chalice trilogy, I was glad to come across this book devoted to Pheresa's subsequent fate, since I found her to be an interesting and appealing character - ambitious, but principled, and self-aware - and her setting a fascinating one, even though it was a fairly routine Middle Ages knock-off. My only real complaint about this book was Pheresa's rather abrupt realization that she was in love with her protector, the heroic Talmor, after several years of being constantly in his presence. A little more romantic suspense would have been nice."
2,"pretentious, silly, and sometimes offensive","I really can't imagine what might have encouraged those reviews above. I found it exhausting to get through this--not particularly because the anecdotes O'Brien tells are boring but instead because O'Brien's tone itself is so off-putting, so agonizingly pretentious, that it actually ends up ruining what I think could be a very fascinating read. I can't recommend this book. Sorry."
2,How the Mighty Have Fallen,"I read The Beach a few years back and, predictably, loved it. It was well-written, plot-driven, and had all the makings of a classic.Because of this (and because I never got into Tesseract), I decided to pick up The Coma. I figured that greatness was Alex Garland's MO, and expected another wonderful book.Needless to say, The Coma disappointed me thoroughly. The story is boring; it's fleshed out in a tepid way and has the feel of a book written by a six-year-old with a fertile imagination. As a short story, this could've worked. As a novel, it falls flat on its face, probably into a coma."
5,Complete protien.,I am a vegetarian. This is a complete protien. It makes great casseroles. It is wheat free. It is gluten free.
4,Good product for purchase price,This product is a great hot water bottle. The attachments for enemas/douching are a little cheapy but it's not an expensive kit. It works well and I'd buy it again.
4,Cara is the only one,"The Cara Water Bottle Combination is the only product of this kind that I have seen (and I have been looking all over) that isn't made of stinky, toxic smelling plastic that makes you wonder what is mixing with the water going into your vital places. Although it is smaller than I would like, one can still refill and continue on. Everything works well and is easy to clean, so you can get on with your day feeling just great."
4,Good Quality Water Bottle - Recommended,"We picked up this Water Bottle at a local ""big box"" store after I injured my back and wanted to use heat therapy on my injured muscle. This bottle is fairly thick so it is not likely to rupture and it keeps the water hot for a respectable time.Overall I am pleased with this as a hot water bottle, but we haven't had the need to use it for the ""other"" purpose.Recommended!CFH"
1,Not so hot,We bought this same product at Walmart and it is very small compared to the traditional old hot water bottles. It is about 10 x 7 which isn't very big. Not useful for us.
3,Okay,"I bought this because it is so highly recommended by Natalia Rose, whom I love and trust. It does have a few issues though. The clamp on the tube won't stay closed all the time so sometimes water shoots out all over the place when you don't want it to. It is difficult to fill and doesn't fit much water (you can't fill it all the way). You've got to have something strong and at least 4 feet up to hang it from. I do love that the tip is comfortable though (I had a disposable bucket that had a painful tip). I actually just took the tip from this and made it fit on the bucket. I have the perfect kit now!"
2,Leaky,"not real happy with it , makes great coffee and is convienient.But it still leaks just like the older models all over the counter.Will not buy another ""new and improved"" as they said this was."
2,"Not perfect, but gets the job done","The other review is right, it isnt super easy to use, but it does slap your initials on there. I'm sure you could get a more expensive version that works a little better, but if you are looking for a device to get initials on a ball, this will do it, you just need a little patience."
4,hydro industries auto hose reel,"i first saw this product on one of the shopping channels about 1 year ago. i called the company and asked questionsisaw it again on qvc but a smaller version,i again called the co. they said it would hold 100 feet of rubber hose.they were wrong isent it back and bought the 200 foot model and attached 100 feet of sears lifetime rubber hose with no problemthank you for a great product"
2,A big disappointment,"I don't really understand all of the ""better than the last"" reviews. I was hugely let down by this album, its a major step backwards from the excellent Fragments into metalcore garbage. This is NOT melodic death metal. Its bland, accessible ""mallcore"". There's not a single memorable track to me found. No great solos, no great dual harmonies, nothing. On the other hand, if you like bands like Trivium, or As I Lay Dying, run out and get this, you'll probably think its great. As with Coldseed, not even Speed Strid could save this dreck."
5,Another Great Album from The Itailian Kings,"Being one of the best bands I've heard in a while, I expect great things from them. Well, ""Mind Tricks"" didn't disappoint. While it doesn't quite up to their (fairly) new released ""The Isolation Game"", it is good. Their Pantera cover, Mouth For War, is better than the original. Songs like Process for Annihilation and Celestial Overdrive, with their crazy riffs and excellent vocals, renew any missing faith in the band. If they go on to make another album, it will defiantly join the ""to buy"" list, even if Speed doesn't sing much again..."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This book is just OK. It's definitely written from/for an HR person, not a law student, although it's absolutely full of cases which makes it a bit difficult to read. The general approach is to present a topic and then give real case examples. The topic information is often, in my opinion, a bit short and could be easily expanded to explain the critical points the cases are trying to enforce / develop. The cases themselves make the book long and difficult to read, mostly because you have to read the back story and legal argument to get to the reason why it was included in a particular chapter. Also, I do find it a bit preachy... summaries and quick examples often tell you not just about the law, but about how certain things are morally right and wrong. If this is for a class, you're stuck.. if you want a good HR / Law book, you might want to try another book."
4,Great Book,I bought this book for a college class I took and I have to say it is definetly worth the buy.
4,Employee Law,"Employment Law (5th Edition)This book is considered the lay-person's guide to up-to-date issues and legal precedents set by the cases and laws we now face in the work-place. If you are not a lawyer, this book will still make sense to you, and all of the pertinent legal issues are covered for workplace diversity issues of today."
3,It's Okay,"The seller over stated the condition of this book, the seller stated ""it almost new"", the book was used and very shabby, the sellers should be honest about the conditions of products that are sold."
3,Not as good as Hip Hop favorites,"Just buy one of this series. This one is not as good as Hip Hip Favorites which my kids ages 2,2,1 adore and I gave a 5 star rating. Also be aware this is not really hip hop. Just has a little boom box bass. There is a lady on this video who tries to teach one little hip hop dance - it is pretty awful. The songs aren't as good as hip hop favorites either. Still all that said the kids do like it. Hip Hop favorites has 3 of the same songs as this one. I really wouldn't buy both dvd's. One will drive you crazy enough since the want to watch it every day."
5,wonderful n diverse,"My son loves this and I love that he can learn and see a diverse group of children. We're a white family who hv adopted a mixed son. Growing up n LA it was easy to integrate w/ other cultures. Tougher to provide that in IN. so @ 21 months we're already looking for ways to provide that (church, books, play dates, socially, childcare,etc).This provided fun learning AND the cultural mix we're always looking for."
3,Not Their Best Work,"With new voices the group sound totally different. Musically it shouldn't change too much but it does and not for the better. The same type of decline as La Makina's ""Internacional""."
2,Unconvincing,"Wiccan Roots is a fairly weak attempt to challenge the findings of Professor Ronald Hutton's scholarly work on the history of modern pagan witchcraft; at least two other books by different authors seeking to question Hutton's research have also since been published. Unfortunately the major failing of many writers who take a revisionist view of history is an inability to remain critically objective. As any scientist will tell you, the first step in establishing the truth or otherwise of a proposition is to seek to disprove it. Heselton, on the contrary, is eager to substantiate his position and throughout his book frequently falls victim to speculation, circular arguments and third party ""evidence"". At the end of the day, he produces no solid additional proof and his book will only convince those who already share his views."
5,Full of complete and important information,"This book helps form IT users to IT services providers, CIO, CFO and CEO to understand the scope of IT process inside an organization, describing precisely relationships and responsibilities for all. A book which should be read by any manager related with IT and bussiness."
3,Peppermint Gels,"I have taken peppermint pills before...this one is good but not as effective as others I have taken.... Also, you pay more for shipping than the product....that should not be..."
4,Seems to do what promised.,"This product does provide me some relief as promised. Like anything, though it is not perfect, but it is helpful."
3,ehhhh,i am using this book in my cal 3 class at this very moment. there are many mistakes in the text and the answers in the back of the book are sometimes wrong or they are factored in a weird way. the text is very easy to understand and with all it's shortcomings i dig this book
2,Sound good / Design bad,This headset has really good sound on the mic and also on the headset. But it's very uncomfortable to use. It's always slipping because the headset is not adjustable. I returned mine for a .90 Plantronics model.
3,Not bad as a basic headset,"A couple of weeks ago, I bought this headset to replace my old one, which had broken. It's a pretty standard behind-the-head type with a microphone. So far, I like it fairly well for light use such as Internet audio streaming, some music (mostly classical), and gaming. The audio quality is decent, and the ergonomics are OK. Essentially, I have to hook them behind my ears. The strap itself isn't adjustable, and it does indeed have a tendency to drop down. This keeps the earpieces from having good contact on the ears themselves and thus reduces the audio quality. I haven't used the microphone yet, so its performance is unknown to me. If you think of yourself as anything approaching an audiophile, you know that a headset in this range isn't going to do the trick. For the price, though, they are pretty nice and I'd recommend them for basic consumer use."
1,"Good sound, great mic, major design flaws.","This headset is one of the new, cool, behind-your-head variety. I haven't tried any of the others by any other manufacturers, but this design just doesn't work. The speakers sound fine, and the microphone is excellent, but as soon as you put this thing on your head, it feels like it's going to fall off. After a few minutes, it slips down and the hard plastic of the band ends up resting on the top of your ears, which gets VERY uncomfortable VERY quickly. It really makes me wonder if they actually tested this headset at all. I definitely would not buy this headset - buy a conventional over-the-head design instead."
1,A Major Let Down,"This is a serious let down. Given the plot and the hype around the author, I was expecting it to be a tremendous read. However, the character development is so poor that one almost no longer cares about the darker elements of the plot or the prose."
4,"""This human being made in your image...""","This is what THE BESTIARY could have been if it stuck to its own magic and voice. What an amazing book - completely distressing & depressing - but well-woven and spell-binding. The unveiling of the child himself, now an adult, facing his struggle to be a father. How this coin-flips over itself several times showing the loss of his own father - the constant misunderstandings - his mother's distance and misleading behavior. Was this kid confused, maniacal, possessed or all of the above. It calls to mind Tryon's THE OTHER from some years back - the 2nd brother is he real or is he...? The theme is similar: ""personality transference"". Very engaging."
1,"I sighed, I yawned, I was bored to tears","I kept hoping this book would get even remotely creepy. I'm by no means a hardened horror/terror fan, and am usually easily scared. This was one of the single most boring reads I've ever encountered. The ending was extremely disappointing... but then again so was the entire book. I do not understand the rave reviews and awards this book received. My advice? Save your money and read ""Origin: A Novel"" by Diana Abu-Jaber. Far creepier, though not in this genre at all."
1,A Good and Happy Pile o' Crap,"I've never reviewed a book I liked, simply because it would be lost in the fray of positive reviews. I felt I had to review this book because of all the positive praise it's getting - which it doesn't deserve.This book is a study in how easy it is to get a novel published when you are a business 'executive' in NYC. You don't need believable characters or dialogue, you just need to write like you took a psychology class in college and are also a fan of 'Rosemary's Baby' and decided that, because you feel so empty in the office cubicle, you were going to write a book to impress your other 'business executive' friends. Never mind those actual talented writers who have everything at their fingers to write a much better novel than this, but have the sad misfortune of living in that wide open space between New York and California.""Uninteresting"", ""unoriginal"" and ""unfortunate"" are all words that could describe this ""book"". ""Good"" and ""happy"" are not."
1,a waste of time,"Don't believe the hype or the fancy cover art or the praise from other authors on the cover. I wasted precious time reading this stupid book...with absolutely no payoff. If you read the overleaf and the advanced praise, you would believe that you are about to read a taut, smart psychological thriller, not a supernatural thriller predominantly about exorcism and demons and all that stupid mumbo jumbo. What a disappointment. Yuck."
3,A horror novel for people who don't read horror novels,"The academic setting, intellectual characters, etc. put this story into a context I could personally get involved in, despite not being a tremendous reader of horror fiction. My only complaint is the abruptness of the ending, which turned a good first novel by Justin Evans into a bit of a Twilight Zone Episode. (And then THIS happens. The end.)"
3,Couldn't put it down but yet....,"Definitely gripping, this story will grab you and keep you from beginning to end. No question about that. On the other hand, it wasn't well written enough to be called great literature and yet it wasn't scary enough to end up in the Stephen King pile. George, the protagonist, is a well-drawn character but he reports on memories as seen by an 11 year old that are well-beyond the scope and breath of the way a child would ever see or remember his life. I did feel all the characters were quite nicely developed and the plot was not at all predictable. I never knew how it would end which was both satisfying and exciting. But I never cared that much for any one character to be enthralled or emotionally involved in how the story turned out. All that being said, I read this book over Labor Day weekend and barely did anything else. I almost loved it...but not quite."
3,Is George insane??? Who knows?,"I had high hopes for this book after reading so many rave reviews. I was disappointed. The book deals with George Davies, a man unable or unwilling to hold his baby son, and delves into his demon haunted childhood. Was the demon real, imagined, or the product of a psychologically troubled mind? The book led me to only one possible conclusion, but the author seemed to not know where to go. The ending, as some reviewers have pointed out, is a little open-ended, but I think that was the point. It makes you decide what really happened and imagine the future for the characters involved.If you are looking for a fright-fest, do not buy this book. If you want to read an interesting tale of a child gone awry, give it a shot."
4,kinda amazing.,"Oh, wow. Unpredictable. GREAT first page. I liked it more than I expected after I began. I thought the parents were most interesting, quirky, but believable. Worth the time!"
4,More psycological thriller than horror,"I truly enjoyed this book and came to care for the ""child"" George who is dealing with severe emotional trauma on many levels. This book certainly leaves the reader thinking about the ending for days. This book is not for the reader who needs a clean, concise ending but if you are looking for a thought provoking, cleverly written novel, this is the book. My nineteen year old daughter is reading it now and I am looking forward to interesting, novel dissecting discussions."
2,Not Very Well Written Or Scary...,"I expected more from this book, but I was somewhat disappointed. It got alot of great reviews from book critics. And I seldom bother writing reviews for books I don't like, but it this case I make an exception...The writing was choppy and seemed to me difficult to follow at times. And the premise wasn't remotely original.If you want a good scary book, try Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House."
4,A fine and scary novel,"I was blown away by this hard-to-put-down novel. Isn't it amazing what a good storyteller can do to us readers? Keep us up at night, give us nightmares, make us check under the bed for anything stranger than dust bunnies. I congratulate Mr. Evans on his ability to totally creep me out."
4,Moose Thermometer,"Not much to say if you like Moose and need a cute thermometer this is just right item, small and fits any where."
1,way to long to arrive,Took way to long to arrive. I finally recieved the item about 4 days ago. Luckily I drop the class I needed it for but if I hadnt I would be failing because it took ao long to arrive.
3,Cultural Anthropology required reading,"The book had a lot of interesting information to read, its a lot of dense material that makes a chapter. I am not a slow reader but there is alot of information in this book that it went over my expected time I reserved for studying. In each chapter there is a few ""green boxes"" that help go over what the previous paragraphs you read was all about, which is helpful when dazing in/out of conciousness, besides having a end of chapter review section. Bold Key Terms are located on the margins with definiations, besides using the example of how the author used the word. The book was put together very nicely."
4,Intelligent and courageous,"In his book, ""Saying 'No' to the War Party,"" William Hughes intelligently and courageously covers many important topics, bringing to bear on many of them his extensive law experience. The voice of the people is so often ignored, as the mass media cozy up to the bottom line of profit-making. Mr. Hughes shows no such restraint, and his writing is refreshingly honest."
2,Some good points...but credibility ruined by his hatred of Israel,"I think that Hughes has some good points about the war in Iraq and the dangers of administrations like Bush's. Where he loses me is in his hatred towards Israel -- this is a man who thinks that Israel shouldn't exist and blames many of our country's problems on Israel's existance. He seems to really believe that there would have been no 9/11 or no war in Iraq if Israel didn't exist in the first place. Sorry, Hughes...a bit far-fetched!"
1,You must be joking,"I strongly disagree with all of the reviewers of this book. I am only fifteen and I can still see the error in your 5 star giveaway . The fact that everybody is convinced the media is somehow cuddling with Bush is simply moronic. Need I remind you that all except for one national news channel (Fox News Channel) leans to the left (to different degrees of course)And just because someone writes a book about something you beleive in, doesn't make it well written. Final thought, I think this book was poorly written and I'm not even a republican, then again I'm not a democrat either. I just hope some people take my reveiw into consideration."
5,How science and religious belief co-exist,"Taner Edis' SCIENCE AND NONBELIEF joins others in Greenwood's 'Guides to Science and Religion', examining ways in which science and religious belief co-exist. Major issues between the two from evolution to modern physics research and findings survey the political and scientific content of debates over science and non belief, consider the impact of theories and findings, and include plenty of primary source documents."
3,Not sure what to think...,"Truth is, I just finished the book and I'm not sure what to write. My feeling towards the book is one of ambivalence. It was a bit dry, somewhat technical at times (at least for me), and I didn't always understand what the author was trying to say. Too often I found myself rereading paragraphs trying to understand the point, not always successfully. Overall, the book needs a glossary and some spark. The best part for me was the collection of short essays at the end by other authors. Their points were clear, straightforward, and had ""spark."" I rate the book 3.5 stars."
5,Great Skin Conditioner!,"I've used all sorts of body lotions but my skin ended up getting dry by the next day. I even tried Amlactin but because it had ammonia lactate my skin got irritated. If I had a slight cut on my skin, the lotion stings it. I tried this Aloe Vesta Skin Conditioner (I got from a hospital when I visited my sister) and used it because I ran out of Amalactin and this things works, my skin was actually smoother & more supple and it lasts. I'm also an avid swimmer so the chlorine of the pool really really dries up my skin but after using this, my skin feels very smooth again. I highly recommend this skin conditioner."
4,used in the hospital,"The product is unscented, which is why my husband like to use it on his hands. It was used in the hospital where I had a recent stay and did provide for some comfort in the middle of a lot of discomfort. The price is reasonable when compared to popular brands."
5,Great product for ending dry skin!,Introduced to this product during a hospital stay last year. One of the best skin care products my wife and I have ever used. AND not overpriced.
1,Simply Terrible,"I take it as an affront that the author of this book is the Vatican correspondent. He is so liberal that I find it hard to believe he is Catholic. I assume he ""disagrees"" with much of Roman Catholic belief.His heavy handed attacks on Ratzinger and his obvious respect for Church dissidents like Matthew Fox and the former priest and homosexual advocate John McNeill is sickening.This book is a real turkey but the author is, I'm afraid, a much bigger one! Beware this prolific misguided writer.Better books on the subject of the life and beliefs of Joseph Ratzinger arePope Benedict XVI: His Life and Missionby Stephen Mansfield a non-Catholic andMilestones: Memoirs 1927-1977Pope Benedict's own autobiography."
3,You pay for what you get...,"I purchased this product since I needed a spare battery. I said hey, what the heck...lets pay $30-40 more and get everything else with it. The most useful of the pack was the carry case and the wide lens which helps out alot and gives you a wider viewing angle. After using the UV and other lenses I'm not too sure if I noticed a difference. The big disappointment was with the light. Going into it I had low expectations, but then I tried it and it worked great for close shots...that is for the 30min it lasted me. The light bulb when out right away. I emailed the sellers and called them, but no reply. In the end the deal is ok, but do you really need all the other stuff?"
5,A great Book to dig into!,"The juicest Greenhouse book in print. This book is so easy to read yet plum full of useful information. This book is a must for the seedling gardeners as well as the master gardener. I loved the illustrations and pictures. The author makes you feel like someone you know, working to make you grow the garden of your dreams!"
4,More than expected,The book was in excellent shape and I received it in no time. Will buy here again.
4,greenhouse companion manual,"While this book is useful, I found it a little to general. I expected more detailed guidelines. Also, not as many illustrations and diagrams as I would like."
4,Served the purpose,"one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product; a wealth of knowledge"
4,Great reference book!!,I am new to green house gardening and this book has become my go to book for all my questions.
4,Very Helpful,This book has been very helpful in providing information on the types of greenhouses and the pros and cons of each type.
2,Could have been better,"How I wish I could write a positive review of this book. Unfortuately, I cannot. This book starts out great and then becomes so bogged down with names, battles, and other details that it loses sight of its topic--the Papal Swiss Guard. There are no pictures, maps, timelines or other visual aids that would help the struggling reader, other than a small color spread of photos in the center of the book. I enjoy reading non-fiction books and I love studying the history of the Catholic Church, but this is the kind of book that causes people to hate reading history. Dry, boring with no sense of narrative. It was a struggle to get through it and I only did because I am very interested in the subject. The only section worth reading was the period about the Vatican during World War II. Maybe one of these days a writer will write a book about the Swiss Guard that is enjoyable as well as informative. This one ""ain't it."""
3,An OK book with a few typos,"This book has a decidedly Catholic spin on history. It provided some insights not found in other European histories, especially on the Sack of Rome in 1527. There were a few typos: Clement VII was not in the Babylonian Captivity of 1378/1409 (page 32). Charles VII of France died in 1461, so he couldn't have gone to Naples in 1491 (page 43). Clement XIV was not pope from 1669-1774 (page 115).The writing style is good, but I should have bought a used copy, as this is a book I probably won't read again."
3,A GOOD MOVIE,This movie is good for little kids but hate it.The Mice is cute and the movie is nice.It is not so bad.
1,CGI?! Bleh!,"Sorry, but one look at the previews tells me that I will not buy these. I prefer the old characters and their charm much better. I'm so sick of the cartoon industry bringing back childhood favorites and 'sexing them up' (think Strawberry Shortcake, etc). Sometimes keeping something the old favorite is far preferable to 'modernizing' it. No thanks!"
4,Fun to dance with,"This is about little girl mice, who love to dance. I remember they went to a ballet and it was about keeping your word, even if it was hard to do. She had different chapters in her story. I loved the dancing, the steps were easy. I love the idea of ballet. The pretty feminine colors, the candies and cookies pink, blue, all colors of the rainbow. Also the songs were fun to sing along with."
3,Last resort for use with legacy devices,"Bought this to use with a scanner (Epson 1200C) because my Mac computer died and I had to get a new one. Although the company responded quickly to my technical inquiry and suggested a variety of settings, I still could not get it to work with my new Mac. However I got it to hook up to my APS magneto-optical. Would like to use it also with an Iomega zip drive, but need a different adapter for it. Cannot daisy-chain devices to it, and if you switch between devices you must unplug/restart the U2SCX."
5,"Thank you, Ratoc!","This product has worked thus far for connecting my Fujitsu fi-4340cd scanner to my PC, which is running on Windows XP Home OS.I was resolved to thinking that I would never be able to use the scanner again and haven't for at least 2 years, but after finding this part, I'm ecstatic that it is now working without any problems.You do want to make sure that you install the most up-to-date TWAIN driver for your scanner before/after you install this item.I'm so glad that I made this purchase. I'm hoping and praying that it continues to work as it has been, but I believe that it will.Thank you, Amazon & Syskey!"
1,USB2.0 To Ultra SCSI Converter Use Ultra Scsi Device As USB2.0,"Totally junk, this company is not serious about their products , and I bought 2 of the same product to check if it was only a defective one, but no, both did not work and I know my machine is not the faulty one because I use the same port for storage."
4,A fun and worthwhile book,"I really enjoyed this book. He goes through some pretty basic things and then goes from there to being able to use these techniques to complete a painting. I like how he introduced color and explained each one on transparency etc. The demos are explained very well, then he goes on to show other ways to use similar techniques. Lots of good photos for reference. It is a fun and very worthwhile book for the beginner and intermediate watercolor painter. I would buy it again!"
4,watercolor for the fun of it,This book has great information about how to get started working with watercolors. Great projects and pictoral step-by-step projects.
2,Great headset.. until it breaks,"I've owned this headset for almost a year now, and have loved every second of it, until just recently. I had heard about how all of my friends had bought one, and then slowly over time heard about how their mics had broken or their sound went, but I had always thought it was because of the way they treated it.But now, I too am having problems with it. It turns out that when I try to use my headset, the sound is very quiet and raspy, like I have a loose connection. I used to be able to just move the wire around and it would work fine again, but now that doesnt work.I bought this headset thinking it would last, and although some of you out there may think a year is a long time, its not long enough. I do not reccommend this headset unless you feel like buying a new one every 9 months."
1,Mine Broke,"About 3 weeks into gaming I heard static on the right side of the headphones, a week later I could hear more static. Now I hear noting on the right side. The microphone is medicore in quality and I dont think I will ever purchase this headphone again but for $20 their isnt much too lose unless you buy yourself 3-4 for the year..Sorry Plantronics I give you 1 Star.."
2,"Liked them, but they broke too soon","I had these for 9 months and liked them, but they stopped working after 9 months. It seems like they are a bit cheaply made, so it doesn't totally surprise me, but it's a disappointment nonetheless."
4,Good product for what it is,"This is a good quality multimedia headset with microphone. I've had it for over a year, and it works well for VOIP, voice chat, and computer audio.This is not a set of high-fidelity stereo headphones. The sound quality is quite good, but when I want to listen to music, I put these AND THE COMPUTER away and pull out the trusty Sony MDR-V6 to plug into the stereo.I would happily buy this product again."
3,"Nice, but didn't last","I've been using this a couple hours a day for about 9 months, and it is already going out on me, having problems picking up my voice, cutting out one ear, and hissing loudly when using the volume control. Until recently, it was a pretty nice headset."
3,They're good while they last,These headphones have pretty good sound and microphone quality. But like others have said they break VERY easily and for no apparent reason. I was playing halo one day and then the cord got a short in it and I don't know why I never put an excessive amount of stress on this headset. I would tell you to save yourself a lot of wasted money and get Sennheisers I have a the PC-150s and I love them.
5,"Ugly on the outside, Comfort on the inside.","after five years of being thrown and tripped over and crushed, my plantronics are finally kaput. i fell asleep wearing them, i wore them for hours - no discomfort. swivel ear cups, comfy wide flexible headband, breathable cushioning. mic swivel was always stiff, but after i got over the novelty of internet telephony, i hardly had use for it. sound quality was entirely fine for music and dvd's on the computer. in short: they were excellent headphones. i miss them."
4,Plantronics Audio 90 Multimedia Stereo PC Headset,I am quite satifised with the headset. It is comfortable and the sound quality is quite good. I would have liked the wire connecting it to my computer to be a little longer. The other reviews I read were right on target.
4,good for the price,I think this item is pretty good for the price. The voice clarity is very good and I'd recommend this if you're using voice chat on Google Talk which is what I use it primarily for.4 stars because the item is huge and appears to be fragile
2,Great Sounding...But No Good,"I just got this headset today. I was so excited when it came, but the microphone was dead out of the box! I'm going to get an exchange."
1,Not worth it!,"I had these for almost 6 months great bass and mic was very clear. Then yesterday I droped it 3 foot fall and I noticed the sound went out I managed too hold it in place but with my finger, I tryed too hold it again noting. $21 but thats my money wasted I expected better, I will probably buy some nice panasonics or some Pioneer headset this time around."
3,OK,it don't have the feature to move files from system back to recorder. the audio sensitivity is low.
1,Worst choice,"Not only a bad product, but also one of the worst companies to deal with. Customers souport? What customer souport does Plantronics offer, right non at all. So don't waist your time and money with thier products.The one star has to be downgraded to a 0 star."
2,hurt my ears,not really a fan. these hurt my ears when i wear them for 35+ minutes. first mic + stero headset i've purchased. not happy.
4,"way tooo much BASS. Only good for games, and internet chat","geez. the bass is so heavy i can't even use it to listen music.I guess you can only use it as ""INTENDED"". for games + internet chat."
3,too quiet,"i had these headphones for almsot two weeks now. the right side is already broken. the headset didn't experience any physical abuse, the right side just stopped working. even if its working, its too damn quiet. when listening to music, i would prefer it be a bit louder."
2,dissapointed,"We have a logitech headset but my wife wanted her own. She asked me to pick one. I choosed the plantronics based on the reviews.The sound is fine but the size is ridiculous. I have the feeling even the stability of the headset suffers because of the size. I feel like the old tv hosts. I would never go out with this on my head. Even my wife, who is not into tech at all, complained. Don't bother with this product unless you live alone."
3,Plantronics Audio 90 PC Headset - replacement,"This was not a purchase, but a replacement for the defective one originally sent.All parts of the process up to this point were desireable, except when I got an email telling me I had to return the first headset or pay for the second also. I had sent the thing back sixteen days previous, hand delivered to the postal counter.Subsequently I received a response email telling me all was okay, they had received the return.Oh and the process of contacting Amazon is tough, not straight forward. Hard to navigate through all the incorrect areas to finally find the right department to contact and actually be able to contact them.Final note, it was Amazon, not an Amazon 'store' that I bought from."
4,"Great Gaming Headset, Slight FLAW","...This headset has everything the more [$$$] version has but a whole lot cheaper. I will state the pros and cons.PROS:1: Great Sound2: Mic is better than average3. Light WeightCONS:1. Might hurt ears if worn for a long time.2. The end of the wire, are two wires that are joined (will explain)Here is where the Slight Flaw comes from, the end of the wire has two leads, mic and sound. It is both connected and cannot be separated. The problem is for people who has speakers and an earphone out. It cannot be possible to plug the ear connector to the speakers and connect mic to the back of the comp. Its a slight prob but if you have a front panel with both sound and mic then you'll be fine."
4,Great headset,"These are surprisingly sturdy, for their price. I was afraid of breaking it for a while, but I stepped on it on accident and it's still fine, haha! The sound quality is good, definitely not bose of course but great for it's price, again."
5,Very Pleased.,"I rated this product ""5 Stars"" just based on the quality of the headphones...I haven't tried the mic yet but I am sure it is fine. The headphones really sound great. They sound MUCH better than the set of Sony headphones I have that cost twice as much."
5,outstanding value,one of the most comfortable headsets for the money. its not too haevy or bulky and allows for hours of use without the annoying pain that comes from other models.
1,Microphone did not work,"Can't give this headset a very high rating as the microphone did not work. I've already returned it to Amazon and hope they will refund my money completely. As I remember, the sound in the headphones was strong, but without a working microphone it just couldn't help me with Skype. Too bad."
1,Junk,"Save your money. I've been through 3 Plantronics headsets over the past year. They are ""VERY"" easy to break."
3,"Works well, Good sound. Short life.","I've gone through two sets of these headsets. The first was good and worked fine till I accidently stepped on the cord and stood up at the same time, ripping the cord out of the headset. I ordered another pair, and they worked fine for 3 months, then the headphone parts stopped working, but the mic still works. For the price, these are pretty decent headphones, but they do not really have a long life. I think my next set of headphones will be the Logitech 980125-0403 Stereo USB Headset 200."
4,Good Sounding Headphones,"I've been using the Audio 90s for a good period of time now. Through that time I've played many games, listened to basically all genres of music, and have used them for everyday computing. The sound quality was definitely above what I expected from a 30 dollar pair of headphones. The bass response is suprisingly good while listening to music and playing games like counter-strike I have no problems pinpointing exactly where people are.My only complaint about these headphones is the comfort level. I don't know if it's just me but everytime I wear these it feels like they're squeezing my head and after a long period of use my ears actually hurt. Other than that these are probably the best pair of lower end headphones you can buy."
1,Don't Buy It. Inline volume control weakness.,"I bought two of these Plantronics Audio 90 headsets in less than year; both had the exact same problem. One day, all the sudden, stereo won't work and I only got sound on one ear. I thought it could be the cable that goes from one ear to the other but after getting stereo sound during a few seconds, I found out it was the inline volume control that caused the lack of stereo sound. I had the exact same problem in two models. I'm not buying this headset for a third time. Take my advince and try something else like a Logitech or a Koss."
1,Broke in no time,"While it worked it was ok, but then it just stopped working. And Plantronics support sucks!"
3,Mid Range Headset,"For 19.99 you get what you pay for. The mic when used for chat sounds a little like a tin can but the sound is OK. Again, you get what you pay for and if a 20 dollar headset is what you are looking for, this is it."
2,I only had it for a few weeks,"I bought this headset and it was fine for the first few weeks and then the left speaker just went turned off. My audio controls said it still played yet nothing came out of it. I would suggest buying a different headset, don't waste your money with this one."
1,DEFECTIVE CRAP! - BE CAREFUL!,"Needed this for voice chat and was very happy when I bought it. It fits very comfortable and sounded great. Then...just about 3 months later I noticed that the sound started fading out of the right side. I moved the cord around and managed to get the sound to come back but had to be extremely still. The next day it was dead. There was no sound whatsoever, altough the mic worked. So under warranty I requested a new one. Basically from here on out the SAME FRICKIN THING HAPPENED for a total of 6 times! I finally decided to just forget about replacing it since shipping it back to Plantronics cost me little over $5 each time. So after paying for it twice,(actual and through shipping charges) and going through some very frustrating times; I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE! Unless you only plan on using it for about 2-3 months (in 1 case less than a month!) No abnormal abuse or usage caused these problems. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,NOT Current,"This book was published in 2005. Now we see in 2011 that the EU was a pipe dream and the Euro may not hold together. The American dream has disappeared for most people with any sense of realistic financial analysis, however, it is apparent that Europe is NOT ""Eclipsing"" the American dream anytime soon. If anything, the highly socialist nature and the poor demographics of the EU will financially pulverize the European continent in coming decades. This book is irrelevant in 2011."
1,It's not happening,"Europe's economy is growing more slowly than that of America. Further more, the population is also growing more slowing and is aging more rapidly.The United States is already seeing a social security crisis, with only about 2 workers paying for 1 person's benifits. This will only continue to work as long as more workers pay for benifits. This remains true for Europe too.If anything, a more accurate comparison would be that of the EU to that of the NAFTA, which is really an economically intigrated North and South America, with has over 800 million people, a growing population, and much more rapidly growing economies. The economic output of NAFTA countires exceeds 13 trillion while EU has only 11. Also, that 13 trillion is growing in excess of 3% while Europe is a measily 1%.Basically, it's not happening.AND... I'm going to say where I got my information... and I don't think anyone ever does this, but all this can be found in The CIA World Factbook."
4,"Stresses his points, ignors a few others.","Looked at in some ways, the European Community has clearly surpassed the United States. It has more people, more GNP, longer lifespans, more leisure time than does the United States. When viewed collectively this presents an apparently monolithic block that indeed rivals the US. And it is further clear that Europe and the United States are growing further apart. It seems that there is no longer the cold war to hold us together.On the other hand, Europe has a long and bloody history of internal conflict. Can you imagine perennial enemies like Germany and France, or Greece and Turkey remaining friends forever? And I'm reminded of other writers such as Lou Dobbs new book that laments and critizes the formation of a bigger trading grouping in North America, i.e. NAFTA.An interesting book with some very good points, well worth reading, but we'll all have to wait and see what happens."
1,Rubbish,"He asserts that we Americans never think of Europe, that it is remote and rarely in our thoughts!Where did the English Language come from?Where is Rome? Where is Greece?Who discovered America?What kind of people civilised the Americas?Gee what do you think we all are Mr Rifkin?A EuroAmerican!Caveat Emptor."
2,Rifkin's analysis is racism masking as social commentary,"The EU-led attack on the US has been going on for many years, and one might appreciate a strong rhetorical statement from their quarters, but this is more a sustained diatribe against the USA than it is any profound statement of European vision.Why must we always end up with a binary war of one versus another? Why can't we understand that our history is a singular one and our future is one of cooperation and mutual understanding? I'm an American, but my people are from Europe. Surely we have a shared destiny, not a fractionated one.It's avowedly anti-American (and thus racist) polemic such as this which prods the Neo-Cons into action and gives us modern-day monsters such as George Bush."
4,Fodder for consideration and debate,"I'm about halfway through and have just come to the first chapter that, I confess, is leaving me scratching my head - network commerce.Aside from that, I've found the book so far to be full of ideas to ponder and discuss with others who might be interested. Or... at least it provides more elements through which to filter/view the day-to-day news of the world.Rifkin brings quotes and thoughts from a multitude of other writers, historical and contemporary, into a thought-provoking stew.This is not an academic book with a bunch of substantiated and indisputable facts; rather, it offers interesting suggestions and makes conclusions based on aforementioned breadth of thought.Easy to recommend."
3,"Fascinating facts on Europe, but...","There are some very illuminating observations Rifkin brings up in his book - illustrating the contrasts of secularism vs. religiosity, more individualism vs. less individualism, etc. However, this book is horribly slanted to the eurocentric position (and I am one who is the opinion that europe IS better in a lot of ways) - this slant is considerable enough to get in the way of the main thrusts of this book. This book also has a ""dreamy"" quality - Rifkin seems to gloss over a lot of shortcomings - particularly the difficulty in ethnic and socioeconomic melding (as relatively poor Eastern Europe joins the union). My opinion of this book is colored by the fact that France rejected the EU constitution while I was reading this book, disproving the Rifkin idea that Europe is currently speaking with one voice. Rifkin's book is a nice dream, but it at this time, a dream in his head."
3,argument on automatic pilot,"Rifkin does a good job spelling out the thesis of this book, and the organization of the chapters seems to reveal a thoughtful, if tedious, building of his main argument. (Since others have commented about this, I won't repeat it here). However, the writing contains many superficial detours through armchair history economics and sociology that feel like they were fleshed out by legions of RA's doing his research. So the writing can make you feel like he's lost in the details at times. I didn't feel this with Age of Access."
2,"Good Idea, Impossible to Read","I really tried to get through this book, but it's just a tough slog. I read some good excerpts in Utne and couldn't wait to get the whole story. But Rifkin started out describing the tangled history of the guild system in 16th century Europe. The tortured prose went on for chapter after chapter. The basic ideas of the book are good but it needs much less convoluted erudition."
4,European Dream by an European,"European Dream is a very interesting read on the conflicting lifestyles, ideologies and culture between Europe & USA. Pretty good and interesting ideas that summarizes the concept are presented in the first part of the book. Second part of the book is pretty much a general summary of the history of Europe which might be boring for people who are already familiar with it. However I believe its an essential part for the average American who is not very history savy. Book concludes with the author's resolutions on the ideaology that he structed in the first two major parts of the book."
2,Unoriginal,"Unfortunately, I found this book to be as unoriginal as it's blan cover. The most stimulating parts were already discovered and passed on in the original personalized wedding book ""With These Words...I Thee Wed""--secular & religious vows, and vows for all occasions and settings. ""With These Words"" was even the first book to introduce a questionnaire that aids in creating your own vows. So I'm not only disappointed that this book obviously has more marketing bucks than original ideas, it proves that you can't improve upon perfection."
3,mediocre,I found this book a little dissapointing. Not much to it. It's not all inclusive like it would lead you to believe. I was looking to design a wedding ceremony. Instead of focusing in depth on one topic it has a more broad overview of every topic. I would of preferred more options and explanations
2,"I enjoyed this book, but...","I enjoyed this book, but it spreads itself very thin and as a result doesn't cover anything in detail. For example, I was expecting more help in the area of creating my own custom wedding vows and ceremony.All I got were very, very basic suggestions to write something that's true to who you are. Come on! I found more of help writing my entire ceremony in a little Kindle book calledHow to Create Your Own Wedding Ceremonyat less than half the price."
2,Not Impressed,"I was hoping since ""The Knot"" had it's name tied to this book it would be exceptional. I found it to be marginal - reiterating a lot of the same information found in every other book about weddings. There were a few ideas for toasts that were really nice - and some of the vows were interesting, but overall - not what I was expecting at all considering the good review some of the other readers gave it."
5,Great in cold weather,I have bought these a few times they are great in cold weather! I have some of these that are 5 years old and still look good and wear great!
2,Denim Bib Overalls,Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand.
2,Not much to learn here...,"Agree with the other reviews I saw. It's about 140 pages all in all at size 14 font double spaced (you remember that old trick from elementary school essays...?). There just is not a lot information in the book. Most people will probably learn a thing or two regardless of experience. Nevertheless, expect to sit down and read this one cover to cover and then not even NEED to pick it up again. You'll probably just know everything it has to say at that point. I'd say if you can get it used and cheap, it's not a bad one to add to a collection - particularly if you're looking for an easy learning book you could have to loan to friends on this topic."
5,The Book of Endless Ideas!,"Every page was full of beautiful examples of great mosaic variations. Great for countless home decor ideas for every room, outdoor and even commercial too. The pages are high quality print and vibrant color. I marked so many pages with inspirational project ideas. I've been cracking, gluing and grouting like mad. It's surely motivational. A Great find!"
3,over-all,"I liked the animation style better than the first show, and I don't mind the faster pace of this new one. The art and story are closre to the books than the other, but the grafitti in the back round confusing and distracting."
5,NEGIMA FOREVVER,I really liked this series. People who hate this anime are hard-core manga fans who wanted a story fully based on the manga's story. This version takes a new take of the manga with an original story. The story is very fascinating and i got caught in it fast! I love all this drama and i firstly watched the entire series on FUNimation's youtube account when they had the whole dub on there. I loved it so much that I just had to buy it!Story- Negi Springfield is a new professor who is 10 at an all Girl SCHOOL! He is able to make contracts with the girls that give them powers by kissing. A magical item that is very powerful is stolen and the criminal is after Negi! Negi will need some help from all 31 girls in his class to solve this mystery.If you like Harems and wonderful comedy and animation get this. I highly recommend this series!
4,Funny!,"This go around for Negima...the show focuses more on the comedy & less on the fan service. There's little to no fan service (not counting the scenes when the contracts are activated). Even though it has a TV-MA rating, to me, children can watch it. My 9yr old nephew loves the show just like me. It's consistantly funny. I can watch this over & over mainly because there's a lot of stuff that the characters say on the sly."
3,Better for young Negima! fans,"I own the original anime, as well as part one of Negima?!. It does not bother me that the new series is not even as faithful as the first series (and that one was only partially faithful)although that is what it was originally supposed to be (according to advance press releases). What bothers me is that the producers took a great story (the original manga!) and dumbed it down to a child's level. I would let a 6 to 12-year-old kid watch this, but I honestly would not recommend it for an adult, unless you like light comedy, and only virginal interaction between the characters. For adults and older teens, stick with the manga and the first anime."
1,negima re-image of the first season not the 2nd,this is false advertising this is not the second season of negima i read the second season of negima in the manga and he's much older in season 2. this is just a re-image of the first season and this one is boring. stay with the oringinal dvd set season 1. read the manga.
4,Very interesting.,I would recommend this book to all who read Mr. Poston's columns in various newspapers;to all native Kentuckians and to the general public in general. Very interesting publication.
4,The odd couple,This is great. the only thing is I would like better if the separators for the disks were stronger or more cases the separators have already come out so it makes it hard to close the case.
5,Great,"Really funny. The performances were genius, the show is amazing, the chemistry is amazing. Love to see the pocket game scenes ans love to see shots of 1970's New York."
3,Brilliance marred by technical problem,"The content is solid 5-star material, and other reviewers have already covered well the brilliance of the acting and writing that made The Odd Couple one of the best sitcoms ever produced. However, while the video transfer is excellent, the audio is unsynchronized to the video to varying degrees. Sometimes the voices are so out of synch with the lips that it is very distracting. Perhaps this flaw is not present in all copies of the DVDs, but let the buyer beware."
5,The Odd Couple,"Love the Odd Couple, just received the first season, and plan to get them all, love Oscar and Felix. Will be watching them for years to come."
5,"Ohh, Felix...what are ya doing?...","I am so glad this show has been released to dvd. This is a classic tv show that still stands the test of time. The series is still as funny as I remember it being. This is a great show for kids too, they will find the characters of Felix, Oscar, Murray and the rest very endearing. Don't wait, go out and buy now. You'll be glad you did."
5,Just like old times,I used to watch it all the times in the 90s when I lived in NYC. This DVD brought back memories from those good old days. Not bad for a pack of 4 DVDs for under $30.
5,Excellent,"Waited long time for Odd Couple DVD,Every thing was just Perfect.Excellent job well done...."
5,"one of the best afternoon shows as a kid, plus soundtrack","Lots has already been said so I will go into that, this was one of my favorite shows, along with I Dream Of Jeannie and McKale's Navy to watch after school. For those interested Brass Ring did a killer cover to the Odd Couple theme song on their album ""Only Love"" released I would say in the very early 70's as their isn't a copywright date on it."
2,Not up to the Movie,"I ordered the first one, because I remember liking it years ago on TV. But I also have the movie on DVD. Just couldn't compare Klugman and Randall to Matthau and Lemmon. It wasn't just the acting, it was also the writing and the direction. Perhaps it's not fair to compare a movie to a TV sit-com, but in this case I guess I have. For those of you who may not have the movie of the Odd Couple, you should get it. It's really good. But you can't go wrong with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. They were great in all their films."
4,Disc problem,"Anyone else having trouble viewing these discs? My DVD player loads it but I can't pick out individual episodes to play, I can only hit the ""play all"" button. Consequently I've been fast forwarding to get to the episode I want to see. That's the first time any disc ever did that to me. It does play fine in my computer, just not my DVD player. Weird. I wonder what they did to the discs?"
3,They were funny,"These 2 guys did some memorable comedy sketches. Funny the second time around too. I forgot how mad Oscar Madison got at poor Felix. It seems that in some shows, he yelled all the time. Funny I was not bothered by it in my younger days, but today, I got uncomfortable with all of his ""angry outbursts"". Still masterpieces of comedy however."
2,Overpriced newbie guide,"I should've known that buying a book unseen was a bad idea. It is the second most expensive book I ever bought, and not the most useful by far. The authors take you on a tour through the Flash environment, as they should. However, they fail to point out what to do when Flash performs unexpectedly. You see, the GUI of Flash isn't all that hard to master. What IS hard, is getting Flash to actually do the stuff you want: I wanted a button that pauses the movie with a click, and continues it with another click. No help from the book. A shape tween looks weird, I want to adjust it. No help from the book. If you want to get to the knowledge level this book provides, just stick with the online tutorials!"
1,Flash 4 Web animation,I would only recommend this book to those who have never heard of flash before. It only provides you with the early basics and does not cover any of the more complex animations.
3,Strong points: Drawing and animation-Weak: Actionscript,"I will agree with the previous reviews. It was really helpful for learning drawing and animation techniques, but the actionscript part was too small and not detailed enough. I have read similar books for Macromedia Director and Lingo (the equivalent of actionscript for Director), and by comparison this book was poor in this area. It is very good for a beginner, but not very helpful for someone more advanced."
1,Very frustrating to follow,"This book was not written for beginners. I read this book first, and then, after getting frustrated trying to follow the instructions, read another book on Flash and thank goodness. This book has very vague commands. Also, there are few illustrations to accompany any of the commands.The authors jump from one project to another with little fluidity, and continue skipping descriptions of key steps, throughout the book."
3,"Better than most, but not the best","John Croteau saves this book. Unfortunately he takes on precious few chapters, although the CD contains more of his valuable tutorials. The other authors work is passable if you're a beginner and it doesn't totally restate the manual like almost all of the other Flash 4 books, but I think I would only be happy if I'd have paid half the price. With lame graphics and largely weak content, this book does not deserve to be the most expensive Flash book that I, at least, am aware of."
3,Disappointing for beginning to intermediate users.,I bought this book solely because of J. Croteau's contribution. oy. J. Croteau is undoubtedly a Flash genius but he's no technical writer. Ideas and concepts need to be presented in a more logical format. He assumes a knowledge level that will frustrate beginning and intermediate users. His instructional writing style would give Stephen Hawking a nosebleed.
3,action scripting?,"i specifically bought this book for flash's action scripting. they (the authors) never really explain in detail how to use it. no examples, even the cd is vague, they go into detail technically, but no real life applications. it's almost if it was copied from an owners manuel. if you want real life examples you must go to their web site. which is fine, but i wish i would have known that before i kicked down the money for the book."
2,A whole lot of drawing,"I find the book is very helpful for someone who wants to use Flash as a drawing program. The greater part of the book is spent learning how to use the drawingtools, how to modify Clip art (why would anybody want to do that? ) and different painting techniques. On the other hand only 30 pages is dedicated to ActionScripting which is the main reason to use Flash 4 and the biggest change from Flash 3. Also it's a expected that you are familiar with some programming language to understand the chapter about ActionScript - it doesn't really teach you anything apart from what commands can be used in Flash. I was also interested in learning more about FS Commands but find that the book only tells me what commands are available and not how to use them."
2,Aggravating at best,"If you are a beginner and have no prior knowledge of Flash, you may find this book to be very aggravating. Although the author claims that this book is for beginners to intermediate users, unless you are an intermediate user you will probably have trouble following the exercises. If you are an intermediate user, I feel you would be very disappointed. Prior to reading this book, I was already familiar with Director 7, which helped in understanding some of the basic concepts used in Flash. I do not recommend this book to beginners or advanced users of Flash. If you are an experienced user you more than most likely have already learned half of the tricks in this book. I would advise you to look for a better reference source. The author does not complete his own thoughts. I found my self re-reading most of the exercises to accomplish the tasks at hand. The book contains mostly advise on how to draw and utilize clip art. Overall I was very disappointed with this book."
2,Lenghty explanations,"This is a book which mainly focusing on teaching how to draw in Flash. Well, I find the tutorial installed in the Flash program itself is much better. With that, I don't think this book should concentrate so much on drawing techniques. For interactivity section, it's been very disappointing because with little visual illustrations, it's not very easy for beginners to pick up. Moreover I find that some of the explanations are too long-winded which kill off my learning desires."
4,"A delicious, delirious psychadelic Sci-Fi Americana Fantasy","This is the original trilogy by Mick published in the fabulous 70's of which ""The Last Stand of the DNA Cowboys"" is the fourth and most modern addition (pub. 1989), This trilogy has been heralded as the 'lost' classic of adventure/pulp sci-fi novels. A long, rambling entertaining tale of the picaresque misadventures of the 'DNA cowboys' (is the Minstrel not Mick's semi-biographical persona?), this is a literary LSD head-trip thru Mick's unique, hallucinatory fantasy-scape of kung-fu movies, sphaghetti westerns, high-tech magnificence and dazed drugged decadence. In short, a deliciously addictive mixture of 70's Americana pop culture. The original trilogy in paperback is now very very rare and fanatically sought after by Farren fans as a collectible. A rewarding and highly amusing read, and for those Farren fans who never saw the original paperbacks, a must-BUY! Visit his webpagehttp://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/"
5,Even if you think you dont want it...,"... you should get it. I dont care for the whole prompted journaling thing, but this baby book is very simple, with just enough prompts to get the gist of the baby's birth and Sacraments. It's a nice record of baby's early years without giving so many questions that Mom and Dad feel like they are reliving the Spanish Inquisition.The only error I have found is on the family tree; there is only enough room to record one set (per parent) of great grandparents and then a space (for one set per parent) of great-great-grandparents. Instead of neglecting one set, we opted to cross through one of the ""great""s of the great-great grandparent line and instead, add both sets (per parent) of great grandparents."
4,a little surprise,"book came as promised, but the very first dedication page was already filled out. I doubt that the sender knew."
2,So disappointing,"For an author with such amazing perspective of the human condition (see, A Happy Marriage), this book was a huge disappointment. All of the characters were shallow and self-interested. I could not understand why any of them were in relationships with each other, or why I should care about them. I stopped reading at about page 100 after trying VERY hard."
3,Not what I expected.,"This book was very informative, but not what I expected. It isn't for the regular person wanting to learn how to design their own website, it is for professionals wanting to get into the business of designing web sites."
1,Web Design for Dummies a waste of time,"I ordered this book along with HTML for Dummies expecting to get started writing simple web pages.I was very disappointed with this book...It spent too much time promoting tools and services outside of the ""Dummy"" concept. It spent too much time offering you a class on how to become a Customer Requirements Gatherer instead of teaching you how to design a web page."
3,AIN'T FOR NEWBIES!!,"I've always resected the ""Dummies"" for their simplicity, however, this book is strictly for ""near"" or wannbe professionals! I do not reccommend this book for the people who want to build their own websites."
5,Great Book!,"After reading this book, I was able to start my own <a href=""http://www.stormfrontproductions.net"">Indiana web design business, Stormfront Productions</a>. SFP has grown considerably over the last year, solely based on creating quality web sites (which was learned from this book). Many of the web design basics we practice are covered in this book. I recommend it to all of our clients looking to update their web site."
5,Great Book,"This book was full of excitement and adventure. Not a boring get-it-over-with bridge at all, I quite enjoyed the ride."
3,Action packed,Very good read.@want to read follow up books. Hope whether keeps series going . Always enjoy magic and odd twists and turns.
4,Keeps going strong,"In this the third book of ""A Man Of His Word"" we continue the story of Rap's quest to rescue Queen Inus and incedently Queen Inus's attempts to survive the Zark Court. We meet some more of humanity's diverse races and Rap lerns a new WORD. all in all a veary good read filed with high adventure and political intrigue."
5,Perfect,Item was as described. Customer service was incredible. Flag looks very nice in my office. I couldn't be happier.
2,Whirlpool Microwave,"[ASIN:B000GZ2GO2 Whirlpool Gold Series GH5184XPS 1.8 Cu. Ft. Over the Range Microwave Oven with 1100 Cooking Watts & Instant Defrost: Stainless Steel]] I purchased this Whirlpool Microwave 2 years ago and it has seen light use during this period. My wife gets home late at night and I use hood lights to dimly illuminate the kitchen. Just recently I awoke to find this Whirlpool Microwave completely dead. No power, no clock, nothing. The bulbs in the hood lighting look as though they became extremely hot before burning out. The ceramic fuse was burnt, too, the main inverter board. Again, this occured when the microwave wasn't being used, when I was asleep. I contacted Whirlpool who refuses to do anything. To repair it will cost $400+ dollars. So I guess I will be buying a new microwave; definitely 'not' any Whirlpool item."
2,Completely Dead,We had a similar experience as noted above. One of the bulbs became hot & blew & now the whole unit is dead. We have had the unit about two (2) years and hardly use it at all.
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!,"Like many others, we got this microwave with our new home. Little over a year later, it no longer works. Powers up fine and appears like it's working but no heat!!! Will not buy from whirlpool again!!"
1,leave it at the store,the volume on this phone is not very good at all.I cannot hear anyone very well. It isn't extremely user friendly either. This phone is fairly worthless because I cannot use it at all because the volume is awful. What good is a 2.5 mghz phone when you can't even hear someone. The page isn't very load either. I rate my old 900 mghz phone better because at least I could hear someone talking on it.
1,weak arguements and dead end logic,"While attempting to find a new ephisemology in the realm of mysticism, Berman discards scientific rationalism without regard for consequence. The main arguements of the book find their basis in missed interpretations of science and philosophy, and are a typical emotional reformist response to the impeding onslaught of a rationalist technology based society. If mysticism is to triumph in this arena, it will have to challenge scientific thought better than Berman."
5,Juicing for Health,I really enjoyed this book a lot. It has a lot of very helpful information regarding the benefits of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. I keep it in my kitchen cabinet as a quick reminder of what each fruit or veggie is doing for my body as I juice it. I also use it when talking to others about the benefits of juicing.
4,Simple and Informative,"I wanted a juicing book to use as a resource that was simple. Also, to use as an introduction to others about juicing. I enjoy this book and it is easy to use with a user-friendly index."
3,logic logic and this book is falliacious.,"this book has so many misprints and mistakes in it. in fact, the numbering on almost all of the questions is wrong. and the answers in the back are wrong often. i an truely sad that the person who wrote this considers themself a master of logic, because this book is so illogical it's ridiculous. however, if it were not riddled in mistakes, it would be pretty decent. BUT IT IS RIDDLED WITH MISTAKES. if you are a logic teacher, stay away from this book. it stinks. literally."
4,pretty fun,"The video is cute. My 4 yr old son doesn't love dancing/singing and i keep trying to find a video that will ""click.""...alas this one did not really either, but i'm pretty convinced now it is a personality thing, not a product thing. it's pretty rudimentary video editing, but the songs are cute and have remained in our memory, so i consider it a success."
4,Hip Hop Baby,"My son loves the music, although, I thought the videos would be longer than 30 minutes. I was also thinking there would be more songs on each video. It keeps my sons attention & he enjoys dancing around. I probably won't buy anymore of these videos."
5,An Amazing Piece of Beauty,"From the center of her soul Tori Amos has produced a profound and provacative album, to open the senses to new heights not yet discovered. Little Earthquakes has proven to be heart-wrenching and very motivating. This accompined video, to the album give the viewer great insight to a musican/philosopher, who is like no other of this generation. This video graces you with Tori's presence and leaves you in awe of her musical talens and abilities. To watch her play the piano is an astounding ecstasy, no doubt leaving you in wonderment and amazement. Tori Amos has found a way through our window, to our souls, by opening her's to us through her music, that another musician has yet to replicate. You will see her passion and desire to do that in this video, and the album."
1,Supposed to be a set,"This book is supposed to be a part of a set that includes a deck of cards. However, it was not clear that this was only the book so I was extremely disappointed at having wasted my money on the book only."
1,no joy,OOrdered in 2012 and have not recieved anything. Have tried to make contact but have been informed that order no. not valid. Cannot trace company or get through to anybody that can enlighten me. Same story with goddess cards.
1,"Oh, please! More wannabee new-age stuff.","People see the author's name and assume the book/cards have some sort of legitimacy as representatyions of American Indian traditions. But this EXACTLY the sort of cultural misappropriation that we have been resisting for decades--the endless charade of ""shamans,"" hucksters, new-age ""culture vultures"" and mysticism-disguised-as-Indianism (tarot with a feather on it!).Please, readers, understand that this is NOT a fair, accurate, useful, or even respectful representation of Lakota (or ANY Indian) traditions. Go read some Vine Deloria, jr. or James Treat instead."
5,Great book,"anyone who is doing commerical driving should absolutely have this book. most state troopers don't know all, this book will help"
4,Exceptional Use of Dialog Moves Great Story,"I started reading ""The Lamb"" because a friend recommended it and finished the book because I couldn't put it down. Bruce Burnett's use of dialog is expert, and the story itself kept me on edge, pushing me from one chapter to the next. Yes, it's a compelling read. Consider this: I started reading it late one night and would have continued through to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I needed a little sleep before work."
4,Great book!,"Bruce does a great job of combining science, action, spirituality and life. I highly recommend the book - engaging, interesting, tearjerker and heartwarming."
1,dangerous,"Many of these items are very difficult to obtain, and even should they be obtained one should not go about preparing ngangas without proper initiation and teachings, these can be very dangerous. This book should not be listed on amazon"
4,good,I got it very quickly. the color is good. i like it. but is seems not wide enough to cover my glasses
4,pretty good,"Works fine, just a little hard to mount on my thick glasses, maybe my fat fingers don't help. Anywho, works well enough."
3,clip on sun glasses,The clip ons came as advertised. The only problem I have with them is they do not stay in place on my glasses. I would not reorder them
1,Not good for ebooks,Diagrams did not come across well on eBooks. I used Nook and most eBooks are really nice to read but I would definitely not recommend this book.
2,Not for beginners at all,"Well, this review is negative, because the title and description very much suggests that this is an introductory book for VBA Excel. It is something along those lines, but the overall excellent and cool idea to program games in Excel is not suitable at all. The idea is nice, but for very beginners it becomes quickly frustrating as tasks and complexity of the content grow exponentially while the readers knowledge and understanding grows linear at best. Simply excercises that introduce the reader to the topic and mofr in depth treatment of the challenges of programming and VBA Excel while dealing more with everyday projects which we normally face would have been a better, but surely more boring approach.So, I am not sure. For me as a real beginner to programming and VBA this book has been a frustating experience from the second quarter of the text on."
2,Great Book but included Excel VBA Projects don't Work!,"I purchased this book because of its approach to teaching Excel VBA in an interesting and fun way. This was borne out when I started working through the book. It was much better than any other book on the same topic I have attempted to use. However it started falling apart in Chapter 2 when the Excel VBA Projects included with the book would not work. This appears to be due to missing VBA references such as ""LCase"" and ""Format"". Where I can find these and how I can install them is not mentioned anywhere. My research indicates that these references are probably part of Microsoft Visual Studio so you will need to purchase and install it before you can work through the included VBA projects! This is a great pity as it greatly detracts from what is fundamentally a really good introduction to Excel VBA. I would have given it possibly a 5 star rating if it had not been for these problems."
3,Just ok,Certainly not in the same league as the Mark Manning series. I had it figured out early on. Lacks the suspense and intrigue of his other works.
1,Mystery? What mystery?,"The only mystery here is why people like this book.It's predictable, dull, badly written, and stuffed with cliches and unbelievable situations. The plot is absurd, the characters are cardboard. Even a willing suspension of disbelief doesn't get you past the first few pages. It's just plain silly.I second tevans' opinion: Save your money for something better."
1,what's the point?,"the volume control is a dial which constantly gets moved if the player is in your backpack or pocket. my ears get blown out all the time. the automatic volume limiter system can't be used because the audio level is so low to start with. this unit is fine if it sits on your desk. want a ""sports"" model, then look elsewhere."
4,Very good CD player but not perfect...,"I bought this player around Xmas time and I have been using it about 4 times a week when I go jogging for about a hour or so. For the most part, its preformed to my expectations.I did notice one slight problem, the battery meter is inaccurate. Sometimes its says you have a full charged battery when in fact your batteries are dying out. I've only noticed this recently when my player started to stop all of a sudden even though it previously showed that the batteries still had a decent amount of charge. That's the only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5."
3,DSJ-301,"I bought this product because it was durable (My cat knocked my last portable CD player off the table, to it's doom). Do not buy this, if like me, your main form of CD's are CD-R's. This player does NOT play CD-R's. My player was bought used, so it didnt come with headphones, but the sound is great in the player. Overall, hmm.. 3 stars."
5,CD Player Perfection,"Quite simply, the SJ301 is the best off all worlds. Sleek way-cool design, unbelievable skip protection (it has NEVER skipped) and superb sound quality. Plus, one can control play and volume functions intuitively (read - without looking) while the unit is strapped to one's hand. Virtually waterproof. Forget the headphones, they are like all others, so-so; go out and get a real pair! All this for about $..., a know brainer!!"
1,"Long Term, Not So Good","I've owned this player for at least four years. And, although I haven't used it for awhile --perhaps six months-- I didn't leave it plugged in and I don't use batteries. So when I plugged in in today, I fully expected it to run. It hadn't been dropped, drenched or otherwise abused, it had just been left hanging on the rail of my treadmill. And the thing won't work. It'll indicate a track for a disc, but then shut down. No sound, no anything. I was going to listen to some jazz while on the treadmill, but now I have to get a new cd player. Bummer."
3,I don't recomend any Sony,"I've heard and seen a few downsides to Sony. I purchased one of their portable CD players, and when I got alittle rough on it, it broke quickly. Now, granted, most people will try not to be rogh on their products--things happen. I knew someone who had a Sony reciever that had a plastic gear in it that wore out pretty quickly. The cost of repair for both was nearly as much as the item. Sony is a name brand, wih products that perform well, but as soon as something is broken (somties easily due to their apparent ""weak-spot"" manufacturing), you'll wish you'd purchased elsewhere. I'd suggest shopping around--maybe check out lesser known brands, they can be just as good."
4,Great Walkman,"Here's what I think about this Walkman:Pros:-Does not skip at all-Very rugged, very secure buckle-It DOES pause-Great for jogging or treadmill,or any other kind of sport-Long-lasting battery lifeCons:-Badly placed volume knob-No belt loop-Really uncomfortable headphones: buy over-the-head onesOtherwise, excellent Walkman, with great sound. I advise you buy."
5,reliable and sturdy,"i used to have this a few years ago when cd players were better then 256mb mp3 players? and i put this through a lot of wear and NEVER has it failed on mei didnt know it until i searched it because it was a gift but this thing it as good as it gets as far as cd players go, i used to drop this while playing and it wouldent even skip.buy it"
4,Great for jogging/running,"I used to have another cd-player that played MP3s, but it didn't work so well for running or jogging. So I bought this one and took a down-grade from MP3s. It is wonderful for jogging and running. It has never skipped on me...and I have even dropped it once...and it didn't harm anything. Now, I only wish that I would have went with the more expensive MP3 version. It does have good sound quality, but I listen to a lot of techno when I work out and this doesn't have the best bass to make it sound really great, but it works for my purpose."
4,"Excellent CD Player, but Not Without Flaws.","I've had more CD walkmans than Elizabeth Taylor had lovers, but I can tell you right off the bat that this is definitely among the best. The Sony DSJ301 Sport Walkman NEVER skips any of my CDs, even when I'm running or at the gym. And the sound projects nicely and offers great clarity and fairly deep bass. What's more, the handle that can be attached to this player will allow you to carry it comfortably in your hand while walking. But there are flaws. First of all, the headphones are a tad flimsy and sometimes fall off my head; a better and more sturdy set would have been nice. Also, even though the battery life is a generous 50 hours, the display won't always tell you that it's running low. (Have a spare pair of batteries just in case this happens!) Besides that, I'm really pleased with the Sony DSJ301 Sport Walkman, and I expect a longer life span out of it than the others I previously owned."
3,Mine was a lemon,"I wish I could give this player a great rating but, in fact, I have very little I can go on for the rating except that mine was defective straight out of the package. Thus, I can't go on about sound quality or other features. It felt sturdy. The controls seemed easy to operate. It just didn't play. The CD would cycle but that was the extent of its performance. I had no trouble getting through to Sony on the phone (always a plus)and after a brief discussion they agreed that it was a malfunctioning unit. I have several Sony items and this is the first time I've gotten a lemon. Based on prior experience, I won't hesitate to buy Sony again but this time I am going to select a different Walkman CD player (the next ""grade"" up.)"
2,sloppy coffee maker!,"First, it is very difficult to see the water in the little gauge that shows the amount poured in. So, it is quite easy to over-pour the water into the machine. Also, as it brews, it seems to get coffee and/or remnants of grounds everywhere on the machine--even in the cavity for the water. It is a very messy and not very sturdy machine.I do not recommend it."
5,I love this group!,This is the perfect addition to any holiday collection and It will really help you get into the holiday spirit.
4,Great Product,"Purchased this at the request of my 16 year old son for pitching practice. Works great with one exception. The photo that is shown is not correct as the pouch at the front bottom does not go the entire way across. So, if they do not hit the strike zone, it will not be caught. Hopefully this is a minor issue for most, but still the correct photo of the item should be shown. Other than that, setup is a breeze and it works great! My son loves it."
5,Buy-It-Now!!,"The quality of the stand is outstanding. The walls of the tubes feel thick and sturdy. The green paint job is also of high quality. The screen is made out of thick, heavy canvas with 6 numbered squares in the strike zone. (The photo does not show the numbers). The strike zone is a little high. My son is almost 5' tall and his strike zone is the 2 lower numbered sections (3,4,5 & 6). The full strike zone target would be perfect for someone who is 6' or slightly taller. You'll need to purchase a bag to carry all the poles around as only the screen can fit into the bag included. You might also need a couple of canopy tarp ties for the bottom if you plan to use it on windy days as the bottom of the screen is not weighted, but does have a brass hole on each corner to attach the ties if needed. I would recommend it to anyone needing a target and am glad that I did not choose a cheaper model."
5,Excellent value and quality,I bought this for my 8 year old son to prepare for kid pitch. Very easy to assemble and excellent quality (very sturdy). The size is perfect for a youngster. The only negative is that I wish it had come with 2 more ball bungy cords to secure the bottom of the screen. I had a couple extra in the garage so it was not a huge deal but wanted to mention so that others are prepared for this.
5,Great product,Very sturdy. The balls fall into a pocket below. No more chasing balls that come back every which way like the more inexpensive pitchbacks.
5,Met Expectations,"I bought this for my daughter so that she could practice her pitching in the back yard. Actually, we have no yard--it's all cement. I set out a carpet runner and the ATEC practice screen and it's worked out great, especially on those rainy days when all the dirt fields around our house are too wet to use. The screen arrived in great condition and was easy to assemble. The only suggestion I would have is that they would include two extra ball bungees for securing the bottom corners of the screen to the frame."
4,Very Good Pitching Trainer For The Price,"The ATEC Pro Pitcher's Practice Screen by Wilson is a very good product. I would recommend it to other parents and coaches for both boy's baseball and girl's softball. It is well made with heavy duty framework and catch screen. It is easy and quick to set and take down. It would be nice if it were to come with some sort of case. The screen attaches to the frame by eyelets that go into two hooks in the upper corners. The middle is secured by two ball-bungiee's that go through two eyelets and around the middle of the top frame. The only other draw-back besides not having a case is that the bottom corners should be secured also by bungiee's, if there is a breeze while practicing outside the screen will move back and forth. All in all a very good product."
4,Pitchers Stand and Screen Combo,"My son just loves it as it teaches him to target his pitches based on the 6 different zones provides. It has been very sturdy, except on windy days when you just need to anchor the legs with something heavy or u-clamps into the ground for added stability.We are very pleased with this purchase."
5,"Fine, inexpensive wine glasses for everyday use","The title says it all: fine inexpensive glassware for everyday use, no frills, completely functional. I hand wash, but I'm not sure it's necessary with these glasses. I bought these two years ago, and still have all four of them (I'm careful with glassware, obviously.)"
2,One doesn't return a gift...,"This book was a gift from a friend who thought I'd like it. And I appreciated the thought. In a way, I did like it. There were heart-wrenching moments and a nifty ending, but I just can't stand wading through the endlessness of the never-ending present-tense. Even in real life one does not live in the present tense. To me, this literary device, posing as great literature, is becoming all too common among gay writers. I'll be glad when writing an entire story in present tense is old hat and goes away."
1,A different point of view.,"I know I'm going against the grain with this review, since everyone else seems to rave about it, but it seems to me that this book was lacking in ""drive."" I felt that I couldn't get connected with any of the characters...and didn't particularly want to get to know them. I had little or no motivation to continue reading more and more, unfortunately. I wanted to like the book...but I couldn't make a connection with the author or the characters. This is the first book I've read by this author, but I didn't think it was of a very good quality. I wasn't impressed with his writing style or characterization. Sorry, guys! Just telling it like it is from another gay man's point of view..."
2,Underdeveloped plot and characters,"Grimsley did an adequate job with descriptive prose that helped to create teh scene within which the ""plot"" unfolds. Howver, his focus on imagery appears to have detracted him from fully developing the characters and the plot. . The books ending was disjointed. . almost as if it came from some other book. This was my first read by this author. . it doubt that i'll continue to read his work."
3,Beautiful Story,"I was so intrigued with the relationship of these two boys. It is passionate, hurtful, warm, and in the end brutal. The frsutarting thing for me was the ending. I wasn't sure if it was suppossed to be a dream or if it was real. I felt abit cheated and confused at the end. But I still recommend it none-the-less."
2,Depressing,"While fairly well written, the story makes me want to sit in a corner and cry. If you're looking to turn your blue skies grey, then read this."
5,a beautiful love story,"It's been two years since I first picked up this book, and it still manages to affect me even when I picked it up now and again to re-read it. It is the first and only (so far) which comes to mind when friends asked me what's my favorite book. Nathan and Roy's story of courtship and love haunts me and makes me care about what happens to them. This is a beautiful, lyrical story which I will encourage everyone to experience"
4,Give it a little time!,"This is a good book, its just that the point of view its told from makes its a little hard to read sometimes. I would at least read a few pages to determine for yourself if you like it. Once you get a little into it, it really turns out to be a great book."
3,Story was great up until the ending,"This book started out strong, with plenty to hook me in right from the start. The characters were compelling, and the situations Nathan had to deal with resonated, his confusion apparent. But the ending fizzled for me. The pacing sped up, which initially created tension. But after the climactic event, the pacing got off track, feeling both too slow and too rushed at the same time. There were definitely things to like about this book, and I wouldn't rule out re-reading it. But the story deserved a better ending than it got, at least in my opinion."
4,Haunting dreamscape,"A Southern Gothic style romance narrated in a voice that gives the whole book a dream-scape feel. The story is told through a film of selective memories, with ghosts both real and imaginary tearing through the veil to make themselves seen. It both skims over the surface and dives down deep, rarely staying in the middle.In a time never explicitly stated - sometime after the advent of cars, sometime before the internet - two boys meet and fall in love amongst the ghosts of the past. The second half of the book reminded me strongly of ""Stand by Me,"" with the group of four boys going into the woods searching for things they don't believe until they are found."
4,Maybe I missed something,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, the main characters are fairly well fleshed out for such a short book. On the other hand, the book does seem a bit directionless. Oh well everyone on amazon seems to love it so maybe I'm missing something. Anyway, If you are looking for a quick slashy read that is touching one minute and terrifying the next then this book is a good pick."
4,What a dream-like gripping novel!,"Dreamboy is written in a hazy way-the way you want a dream to go on and on. It is mildly erotic-the end is horrible! I couldn't believe what happened, and the end leaves you with-is he dead? is he living? Most likely poor Nathan is dead. I was taken aback with how passive Nanthan is. Roy should have done more with helping Nathan leave his family, but he did what he could. Overall, an incredible book!"
5,Astounding Work of Poetic Art to Race to Your Heart,"Expecting something more along the lines of a giddy dose of lust, I was surprised when I came to discover more about this novel. While a story of love between these two boys flows onto the pages, the book rises to be much more than that. The author's ability to clench his hands on your attention and never let go until the heart racing end is quite powerful. What got me most was the fact that I was getting an interesting read along with a Good read. The story will drag you to the center! I am amazed with this book. I am amazed with this author. I have since bought everything I could find by him. Dream Boys has flown to the highest place in my heart; being one of the most poetic works of art I have met. Truly haunting, tragic, and mesmerizing. You WILL be proud of your discovery."
5,Deeply Moving,"A superb book, the last few pages were agony. I read every single word slowly and deliberately, hardly daring to turn the page and find I'd finished it. Without doubt a masterpiece."
2,A two-hour read,"A strange little book, this reminded me (in tone if nothing else) of Alain-Fournier's ""Le Grand Meaulnes"". But it is even slighter than the French classic. I read it straight through in a couple of hours, gripped only by the creepy section in the ruined house in the woods.The first part that deals with the way Nathan and Roy get together is pure fantasy - schoolboy dreams. The child-abuse subtext is peculiar, cheaply handled perhaps. The ending is surreal and disconnected.Grimsley writes in a dreamy cloud, but skims the surface. I started to wonder about the meaning of Nathan's return at the end (was it really him or his ghost that came back...) but decided it was like trying to psychoanalyze a soap opera.Ultimately, a flimsy, rather pointless novella."
3,nice story but too flowery,"I decided to read the book before watching the film. I was impressed and I wasn't...While Grimsley sets a wonderful narrative and tells a great love story without packing any implausible or Hollywood plot devices, I have to wonder if writers in this genre always feel there's a need for tragedy in these types of stories...I loved the pacing and the quiet narrative, but really, does flowery prose really equate to great writing? I recommend the book, but the text is overly descriptive bordering on clichéd. I preferred the story and how well nuanced the characters were, much more than the actual writing. (I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars but that doesn't seem an option here.)"
4,a different view to a known story.,"Every person that you thought you know though other books are put to a different kind of light some end up real nice and some just were better of liked in other books. Merlin was the best as in all books he says the most meanly full things. Nimue had a grate new veiw not as evil. Plus another love other then Merlin. It was nice reading a book that does not go to close to Aurthur that you forget that there were other people alive in that time that ment alot to the story. ""Fate is inexorable"""
4,Good intro to a great trilogy,"Though not the best book in the series, this book is extraordinary in and of itself. The only problem I had with it is that the first eighty or so pages of this book drag a little bit until the reader can actually get to the plot. Once there, you won't put it down. Read that first 80 and introduce yourself to Derfel Cadarn and I guarantee you will not be disappointed once you get past the introduction."
5,A compelling novel about an ambiguous King,"Bernard Cornwell takes you to a magnificent trip in an era that has little to do with what we live. Atrocity, abusiveness, vulgarity, passion, love, pain, intelligence, obstinacy, vanity, ambition; all included in an marvelously written novel which will deluge you with emotions."
2,slow beginning,"its ok, starts in real boring language that makes me wonder if its going to change later on or not"
3,Mud rather than mystery,"While I enjoyed this novel, I found the telling of the Arthur tale slightly diminished by the emphasis on reality rather than the mystique one usually expects in the tale. There is a grittiness in the story that is reminiscent of Michael Crichton's novel, Timeline, which may appeal to the reader.The story left me with a similar feling that the original Batman movie did, with its heavy atmosphere of darkness weighing me down."
2,OK,"Not crazy about this one. I love Cornwell, and the Saxon Chronicles are some of my favorite, but this one he seemed to just try way too hard."
3,"More fiction than history, but good read anyway.","Winter King is OK book. It's not as good as the Last Kingdom, which first got me introduced to Bernie Cornwell, but it's OK.Frankly, I don't think the book is historically accurate. More mythical. I beleive the historical thing is more like the movie in which Arthur was actually a non-royal Roman general Artorius, and Lancelot was a Samartian warrior from the steppes of Russia.I can't beleive Bernie turned Lancelot into a woosie. Not sure where he's getting all this, but like the part about Uther and Morgan being half-burned rather than really hot chic that I was told she was supposed to be. OK. Later book said...she was a hot chic who got half-burned, but how am I supposed to know that?And who's this Derfel dude anyway? Bernie just made the whole thing up, but then again, I bought six of his books so far, so what am I kidding myself? Bernie will be like ""Dude, this is historical FICTION...Not history. Hello!!"""
4,Better than sequels,"A decent reading. This one is, by far, the best of the books available in the trilogy of the ""Dux Bellorum"", the Chronicles of the Lord of War, in which Cornwell pretend to somehow reconstruct the Arthurian Legend based largely (must say solely) on his own and particularly opinion. At least in this reading, Derfel is not yet ""Rambo Derfel"". Entertaining work, but entirely fictional despite the use of historical and semi-historical names and places."
1,Kindle Version out of print?,I am completely stumped.How can a Kindle version be out of print?Did they run out of bits?
5,Bernard Cornwells best work.,"These books really turned me on to Bernard Cornwell. All his stuff is good, but this series is his best. The characters are great, the writing well done. I felt a part of the story. Some people have given poor ratings because it is not a traditional Arthur legends. If that is what you are looking for then look elswhere. This series is a new spin (honestly how many times do ocinnedeagh or the other negative reviewers want to read the same old Arthur Legend?) on the tail. It is one of the few books I've read many times. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, or get the whole trilogy."
5,A Great Book,"A great book, my first of Bernard Cornwell. Tough to put down, I finished in 10 days. Very good story telling can't wait to read the next."
5,This is the Real Arthur.,"Cornwell's interpretation of the Arthurian legend is the only one that sticks in my mind. All others (T.H.White, Tennyson, etc.) are now shown up as effete, unfocussed, over-romantic, and as Mediaeval fantasy.The cutting away of the Mediaeval chivalric code, knights in plate armour and maids in tall pointy hats has done the legend a power of good. That stuff was all military propaganda for Edward the First in his invasion and subjugation of Scotland anyway.All the characters are believable and extremely well written, with the possible exception of Arthur himself, who is not given as much colour as one might expect. But then writing about heroes is the most difficult art. It's the backdrop, the construction of Western Britain in the Dark Ages that takes my breath away.I shall be reading this trilogy again and again for many years."
2,This is not the legend you think you know.,"Mr. Cornwell takes away all the magic, fantasy and glamour from the Aurthur legends, and leaves a story of wholey unlikeable characters. The story is more realistic to the time it portrays, and the meathod of storytelling is done well, but there are no characters to root for in the book. Arthur, what little there is of him in the book, is wishy washy, and introspective, Lancelot is a vain coward, Gweniviere has her own agenda, and when Merlin pops in, he is ineffective. The battle scenes are written well, and were the only segments that transported me to another place. I will read the other installments only because I've come this far and The Winter King doesn't end. It's continues with the next book, and to stop now would be like walking out 20 minutes into a movie."
3,Arthurian myths for a modern audience...,"The most striking thing about this novel is how it inverts the traditional Arthurian myths - making Lancelot into a scheming coward and Merlin into a dirty old man. It deals with the rise of Arthur to power in the old British kingdoms after the fall of Rome and the Saxon invasions.The narrative is realistically done - often brutally, since this is quite a violent book in parts. That is part of the attraction. The depictions of violence and war are vivid and bloody, as to be expected from Cornwell whose writing is readable as normal. The characterisation can be a bit frustrating and repetitive but is generally good. On the whole this an interesting novel, though one might argue not on a par with the original Arthurian myths. It lacks the supernatural elements which make them so timeless."
3,Bit slow in places but still a good read,"A different take on the Arthurian legend, its a good read but can be a bit slow in places. I went on to read the rest of the trilogy and it was worth pushing through the slow parts to get to the end of the story."
5,A historical novel not a fantasy novel!,"I have read most of the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell. I have mostly found them a good read being a fan of historical fiction. I was hesitant to read a book on ""Aurthurian England"" for I have found the hackneyed legends sorrounding Aurthur's myth tiresome. But WOW this is an incredible novel that brings to life a possible historical basis of this sparsely documented time in British history. It is a rich and exciting portrayal of Arthur and plausible explanations of the people and events that brought about the legend of Excalibur. I must say it is the best of his novels I have read so far and am excited about continueing with the series. I have found that those who have not enjoyed this book have been looking for a fantasy novel of a traditional sense about Avalon etc. This is not it."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is not a review of the novel, but instead of its electronic version and is offered as a caveat to would-be purchasers.The ebook version of The Winter King is riddled with textual errors, perhaps as a result of having been created using Optical Character Recognition software and certainly for not having been diligently proofread, if it was proofread at all. These errors are a consistent distraction throughout the book, occuring most frequently in proper nouns which, as they recur, do so in a strange and apparently random variety of misspellings ... sometimes within a single sentence.Additionally, there is no functional table of contents for the Kindle edition and a map meant to be included is not.Perhaps Penguin will see fit to correct these many errors in a future edition, but as of this review they are an unfortunate and considerable detriment to enjoying the book."
5,Finally.,"Finally there has come a believable rendition of the Arthurian tales. Warriors, wenches, wizards and war created by Cornwell's masterful hand, using his vivid colors of dirt, blood, love and hope, come to life -- and death -- in these pages. We bow to you Lord Cornwell, and wait breathlessly for more."
5,A Great Read,The Winter King is a great opening salvo in the Warlord Chronicles trilogy. I'm just into the second book in the series (Enemy of God) and am getting more than my money's worth out of the story. I've become an ardent fan of Cornwell's.
5,Enter the time of Arthur,"This book ROCKS! This book is the 1st in the Warlord Chronicles. Winter King begins with the story of Derfel, a young Saxon boy who is enlisted in Lord Merlin's services. Derfel trains to use the sword, shield and spear while the other characters and story unfold. Merlin, Arthur, apprentices, family relations, and armies face issues of loyalties, exile, survival, and war. The Winter King is about the return of Arthur. It has vivid and suspenseful battles. If you read this, you will get a taste of life during Arthur's time. I couldn't put this book down and read it cover-to-cover non-stop. I enjoyed the Warlord Chronicles even more than the excellent Grail Quest series, also authored by Bernard Cornwell. Read it!"
5,The Real Arthur at last!,"Soon after I read Dr. Phillips ""The Search For The Holy Grail"" in which he describes his research into the real King Arthur as a warlord in 5th century Britain I stumbled across this magnificent book...and it described the same, believeable heroic ""King"" Arthur. I love the way Cornwell cleverly weaves the tales so as to show how the mediaeval myths came to be folklore. For example: the heir to the throne laying his sword ON the royal stone to be picked up by any challenger, and, in later books the myths around the treasures of Britain, Tristan and Isolde, the lady of the lake and more. Derfel, the storyteller is a clever character and I think that Cornwell may have come pretty close to telling the story of ""King"" Arthur as it really was. I couldn't put it down, right to the final, surprising ending in ""Excalibur."""
5,Best Arthurian story ever!,"I read this trilogy over 10 years ago and was totally absorbed from beginning to end! Just couldn't put the books down and was actually disappointed when it all came to an end in 'Excalibur'. I wanted still more on the era! I've always enjoyed books about the legend of Arthur but Cornwell's trilogy exceeded them all. His version of the legend is so much more entertaining and even believable compared to many other versions. Wish HBO would do a similar series on this trilogy like they are doing with 'Game of Thrones.'So glad to see the trilogy now is in a Kindle version. I've clicked on 'I want to read this book on a Kindle' several times in the past. Now I'm ready to read it again! Even those who may not be interested in the Arthur legend might enjoy it for its historical value. I've enjoyed all of Bernard Cornwell's books but the Warlord series was, in my opinion, the best of his work."
5,Simply fantastic,"Cornwell kicks off one of the most enjoyable Arthurian sagas I've ever read with a strong debut full of likeable (or dislikeable, in some cases) characters that seem to leap out of the pages. This book is one you can't put down, and is a must for any Arthurian buff. I would say that this should earn its place among the classic Arthurian works like ""The Once And Futute King"" or ""The Mists of Avalon"". Cornwell spins an amazing telling of the legend, yet keeps it grounded enough to make even the most cynical start to believe, and even dream, of Arthur."
1,"Repackaged ""Sequel""","This is just a repackaging of ""Sequel,"" the last album that was released before Harry Chapin died.The authorized version is on the official Harry Chapin website."
5,Perfect Carrier- Gorgeous and Functional!!,"I bought this carrier for my Bichon Frise puppy after searching many weeks for the right carrier on numerous websites and at pet stores. Most carriers i saw were too small or didn't provide enough airholes for the pet, which i felt was important. When the carrier arrived, just three days after i ordered it, I was amazed to see not only, how beautiful the carrier is and also how well made it is. It exceeded all expectations. While it is more money than i ever expected to pay, it was well worth it."
4,"the antidote to the Voldemort ""romance"" in Schindler's List","I can't remember the name of the main Nazi in Schindler's List who had a thing for Embeth Davidtz. We've endured and been embarassed by the Love Thine Enemy (who Murders your ENTIRE FAMILY) theme for many years in Holocaust on television and the big screen. Surprisingly, I caught Bete Noire in Season 1, Twilight in Season 2 and Kill Ari in Season 3 on television. And I appreciate the palate cleanser. I'm not a regular watcher of this program. The ending of Twilight says it all. That's the truth. That's the fact.After the Memorial Day marathon (the strategy works), I find that the series was more entertaining with the introduction of the Ziva character but I still find the show bizarrely written. Mark Harmon doesn't do anything and sometimes his lines don't make any sense. The show is really the three supporting cast members who work under Mark Harmon's character. I'm not that entertained by Abby and Duck."
1,Was John Paul II like this??? I don't think so!!!!,"I don't understand why ABC broadcasted this movie, the only reason I find is that they tried to shadow CBS's own effort to conmemorate the life of John Paul II, but what they got was a cheap, bad performed version. When I saw it, I thought of it as an insult to the life of this Great Pope and not as a recognition to it. The actors where not up to their standards, it seamed that it was done as quickly as possible. If you really want to learn about the life of JPII or you are a catholic who loved the Pope and want to buy a movie of his life to cherish in the future better get KAROL the man who became Pope or CBS version starting Cary Elwes and John Voight (I don't remember the title) which were done with love and respect."
4,Good Movie,"This is a very quick, nitty gritty movie, but it is well acted and if you have no clue about his life, this will certainly fill you in and let you understand just how amazing of a man he was."
3,Interesting first novel,"I liked this story even though it didn't always keep me engaged. The journal format didn't seem to work as well as it should have; it rambled and I also had to wonder how a person like Shade could possibly keep up with a handwritten account of her life.Shade, is a great character with an interesting story to tell. It was satisfying to see her triumph in the end, especially after so many of the people in her life used and abused her."
1,Yuk! get the Greatest Hits Instead!,"The Greatest Hits released by MCA in 1996, it's way better than this collection!, the only good thing about this, is that they included the""Off The Hook"" track, wich is not available on the previous Greatest Hits cuz it came later."
4,A Real Good Overview,I like the Jams that Jody Watley&Andre Cymone did together&many of them here are featured.however I think that there are better overall Greatest Hits Packages out on Her.but this One Covers Her Main Jams.Jody had a vibe about Her that worked back in the day&you can't go wrong if you are just learning about Her work.
5,The Definitive Book on Winchester Model 1873,"I own this very large two volume set, and must say it is the most complete review of the Model 1873 Winchester I have ever seen. It includes many pictures of variations of the Model 1873 and a rich review of the history of the ""Gun that Won the West"". Best of all is the comprehensive review of the different versions of this great American invention and a scale of how rare a gun may be based on many different factors, such as barrel shape, sights, caliber, number of versions manufactured, collectability and desirability. While no author has ever completed an inventory of all 700,000 rifles, Gordon does a fair sized sampling of different configurations to demonstrate the rarity of a particular variation. Best of all are the pictures in this huge, two volume set that shows off the Model 1873 in big, clear pictures. This is a must have for any serious collector of Winchesters."
4,Fits great. Order separately.,"This fit my 1993 Ford Escort LX perfectly. Don't do what I did and somehow manage to order 2 thinking I'd ordered a Left and a Right. The Right is a different part number. It's obvious to me now, but some how, that's what I did. And I marred up the bolt heads enough while starting the second installation to make the second one unreturnable. However, my own foolishness aside, this product fits the Left Side like a glove and stops my hatchback from smashing into my arm every time I open it, even on a hill. One works well enough for me that I may not even order the Right side unit. Good product, wish it was offered as a L/R set in one purchase."
5,FATHER AND SON: TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE: BOTH GREAT !,"Simply wonderful fun...as a native of N'Awlins for many generations, we have had the pleasure of dancing to Rockin' Dopsie, Jr & Sr, live performances. This is the best of the joy music can bring to an otherwise ordinary day."
1,Incomplete,Does not include the cables. When I read this about the product prior to purchasing I figured it had to be that one person's bad experience. No cables. Total BS.
2,2 of the 25 cases were broken,"Two of the 25 cd cases were broken at the hinges which doesn't seem like that big of a deal but the whole point of getting cds with cases is to have functioning cases. If I didn't need the cases I would have ordered a spindle of cds. It's cheaper. The packaging seemed fine and since the box wasn't dented or scraped at all, I assume the delivery person was careful enough with the delivery."
3,NOT AWESOME,Not great. Music sounds scratchy and skips. Quantity not quality.Worked fine for my 3 & 5 year old party favor mix cd.
5,Item as described and fast shipping,The item was exactly as described and I used half up them up right away because I am making mixed Cd's for friends and family.
5,Justin Vigmostad,"I have never been as inspired or excited to get better at tennis as I am now, having read this book. Clint's method of teaching, even through a book, is so customized to each individual's tennis game that it's as if he is writing directly to you. Instead of changing your tennis game to be more generic, the Tennis Guru works with your natural abilities and puts you on the path to becoming the best tennis player that YOU can be. I highly recommend this book, and if you ever have an opportunity to take a private lesson with Clint, don't pass it up...it will change you and your tennis game forever."
2,Strap broke after 1 year - Pure Rubbish !!,I had this watch over a year and the rubber strap broke in two - Very dissapointedI won't buy Timex again !!!!!!!!!
3,It's cute but...,"Very cute humor but...Unless your getting this as a gift for someone or it's an inside joke you've been looking for your whole life, I don't recommend buying this book simply because it is too short. Cute though... Not for animal rights advocates."
4,as expected,bought it as a gag. Book as advertised. Look inside section gives a good idea of what the whole book is like.
5,HAHA! The Alien got kicked in the balls!,"I LOVE this book! I would love to see him make more like this one!...maybe turtles, or baby chicks? And for some reason, it cheered me up...in a sick and twisted way! THIS IS A MUST HAVE!"
4,A SICK MIND,"IT MUST TAKE A SICK MIND TO COME UP WITH THE SORT OF STUFF THAT IS IN THIS BOOK.BUT THEN AGAIN, IT MUST TAKE A SICK MIND TO LAUGH AT THEM.""BUNNY SUICIDES"" IS JUST THAT: A COLLECTION OF CARTOONS, ILLUSTRATING THE SUICIDALE ATTEMPT OF BUNNY AFTER BUNNY AFTER BUNNY...IT MAY SOUND DISGUSTING, BUT FOR SOME REASON I FOUND IT TO BE HILARIOUS.IF YOU HAVE A BIG ENOUGH SENSE OF HUMOR AND HAVE ENJOYED THE LIKES OF ""THE FAR SIDE"", THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,well...,"Quite sick, not that funny. Some drawings are particularly disgusting. I don't know, but I think the majority of it simply doesn't work."
2,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it has hardly made me smile... I wouldn't recommend it at all."
2,a bit childish,"this book is a lot better than ""Unpleasant Ways to die,"" but most of that is attributed to the fact that we all want to smash bunnies with our fists. fun little sequences, while others are lame and predicatable, not the kind of book you'd buy if you're trying to hit bottom."
1,SICK SICK series,The sicko who wrote this series would not have had it published if it had been written about children and the sickos who find it funny would not find it amusing if it was about children!! Bunnies and other animals are helpless creatures so don't write or read/condone sick stuff written about them if you wouldn't read/condone the same stuff about children!!
5,Best Gift For A Down Economy,"I just received this great book as a birthday gift. What a treat! I especially love the corkscrew suicide. Kept me in stitches for several minutes. For people who have no idea what this book is - it is a cartoon: there is no gore - no graphic violence (except in your mind - YMMV) and yes, it is screamingly funny and clever. I cannot wait to pick up the sequel and laugh away at that one as well.Felling a little down about the world around you - read this book!"
3,Not highly impressed,"I thought it would be a lot funnier than it was. I think everyone else hypes this book up too much and set it up for disappointment. Cute book to sit by your toilet for guests, but other than that, it is just something you will read only once. I found the book of 101 uses for a dead cat much better."
1,SICK SICK series,"Bunnies are sweet,loving,and innocent creatures and anyone who could write books with this sort of theme is a very sick person as are everyone who would find it funny!! If it was about children there would be a major outcry over it,but because its not its ok. Animals are just as helpless as children so if you wouldn't want books like this about children don't condone it about bunnies or any other animals!!"
1,There is nothing funny about this book,"I cannot believe that anyone took the time to write such an empty, humorous book. It is not worth even the time to write this review, but I feel compelled to perhaps influence someone else who might expect something worth reading."
1,AVOID,"I can't believe a human being would actually laugh at this sort of thing. Watching rabbits die is NOT funny. They are tender, adorable loving creatures that mother nature brought into this world for people to respect. You're not supposed to enjoy suicide bunny stories. Please don't buy this book. I don't want a book like this falling into the hands of an innocent child. Even an adult purchasing something like this is wrong on SO many levels."
4,Funny bunnycide,"Andy Riley, a British cartoonist and creator of a weekly comic strip in the Observer, tackles the off-the-wall subject of bunnies who simply can't go on living any more. These cartoons explore the outrageous and creative ways a bunny might dispatch itself to that great hutch in the sky. These include such methods as sunning on the beach while Noah loads the Ark, becoming ballast for a hot air balloon, and catapulting through venetian blinds. This book is morbidly funny and tragically silly. If you like humor that's a cross between The Addams Family and The Far Side, this book is for you."
4,SOOOOO soft and comfortable!,There....I said it. Love the look (on my husband) and the feel of both the pants and the blanket.
2,all they are is stickers!,"ok it was a great idea, but what i thought i was getting and what i actually got were totaly different.i dont think that the product is worth $20 with shipping included. i mean come on they are prety much just stickers you put on the back of your ear. i thought it was going to be something so much better and more derable. they mack it sound like its this super sticky adhisive but its not. i would say that this product is only worth about $2 not $12-$20. RIP-OFF!!!"
1,Dissatisfied,"I originally purchased this product from Wal Mart over one year ago, but soon discovered that they no longer carried this product. During the times of my prior purchases in store, I swore by this product as it truly helped with my problem of stretched lobes and I also noticed a difference after I stopped wearing them. Unfortunately, when I purchased these from this seller, the tapes did not stick to my ears at all. This is a wonderful product however, perhaps the seller has had them for too long! I plan to purchase these elsewhere, not from this seller ever again. This is a fantastic product, if not too old!Very dissatisfied with this purchase!"
1,Not worth the money,"This product is truly a waste of money. I purchased the earlift about a year ago and I saw no difference in my ear.Basically it is a small piece of tape in the box, which is supposed to be placed behind the ear. A majority of the time the tape did not stick and it never stays in place. I can take scoth tape and cut it in a small pieces and place them behind my ear. This is a total total waste of money."
3,Where is it?,"I never received my first order (Order ID:62234, Order Date:3/27/2010, credit card. I ordered 3 packages of CP2 Clip Comfort @ $5.95 and a total of $23.60 including shipping.I later ordered a book from Amazon and reordered 2 clip comfort packages. They arrived quite quickly.What happened to my first order?????Please respond!Jeanne Blumer705 Happy Valley Rd.Prescott, AZ 86305"
4,NOW EAR THIS!,"These work really well. I had ripped my pierced hole all the way thru, and had to have it sewn back together. It was difficult to wear my heavier earrings, until I got and tried Earlift. They really work! I highly recommend them for everyone...even if your pierced holes arent stretched or torn, use them to save your pierced holes!!"
4,EarLift Invisible Ear Lobe Support Solutiion,They work and I have not seen of any other product on the market that works as well or better
3,Too difficult to use,These really do work if you can ever get your ear ring through them. It was too difficult and time consuming for me.
1,does not work,Either I don't know how to use them or they just don't work not sure which. This was extra disappointing after waiting over 3 months for them to arrive.
3,Better than nothing,"The stickers stuck on fine and held the earring, but the earring hook still drooped towards the bottom of my streched piercing. I will still use since the heavier earring didn't tug on my lobe as bad."
2,Disappointed!,"I formerly purchased the same thing from""lobe wonder"" and got more that twice as many of the very same thing.This is pretty much of a rip off in my opinion. Go for Lobe Wonder!"
3,Earlift,"The Earlifts are good, I received them fast,and they are used everyday. I think that that they should be a little thicker."
4,Sister is RAVING about this!,"I bought this for my younger sister for Christmas because her left earlobe is torn quite considerably, and every time she wears earrings they're always so lop-sided. I knew there was a surgery to fix this, but I don't think she'd ever be up for that. She was so excited to get these!! She uses them every single day, and tells me the adhesive is incredibly strong - so strong that she forgot she had one on while she was showering and it STAYED ON! The only ""con"" was the whole matter of learning how to use them, but other than that, I know she'll be wanting more of these soon. Great product at a great price."
1,Do not recommend,I bought this with thinking that is going to be helpful and prevent my earlob from tear. These little patches do not stay in your ears and hold the earrings how it suppose. I just lost my money.
5,Very Handy,"I decided to buy this because of the price. I've seem some of the really expensive ones they have out there, but it was out of my price range. I like what I have gotten for my money. It shows me the different bands and the strength of the signal.A problem that I have noticed with it is that sometimes it will go off when there is nothing there, usually the X band with a strength of 1 or 2. It also is hopeless if an officer hits you with laser.However, it is definately a good detector for $100."
2,"While it worked, it was great...BUT","....But now both of my units have stopped working altogether because the connection no longer worked. It started with just an annoying little wiggle to get the thing to come on and gradually croaked. Personally, I have never had any luck with power cords that are not flexible. If the straight cords get stuck on something, off the dashboard they go. Just my 2 cents worth."
5,Works great!,"Have made bread twice with this hook, and it is SO much easier than hand kneading! it made my day."
3,A great Takashi Miike resource...but...,"The Good: For Asian cinema fans, this book is an absolute must, strictly because it covers EVERY title in Takashi Miike's prolific career. This is the only resource you'll find for all of his 50+ films. It also includes Miike's 'Ichi the Killer' production diary, which is both hysterical and insightful.The Bad: Film critic/writer Tom Mes is dull and humorless when it comes to his critiques of each title. He plods on like a boring film professor, nit-picking his was through plot and subtext. For the most part, he understands Miike's films and themes...but his stilted observations seem to suck all the joy out of them. In the end, this book feels more like a technical exercise than a celebration of a gleefully illogical and colorful filmmaker."
3,Problems with drives over 137GB?,"I've had mixed results with this software. I first attempted to use it to migrate my desktop's hard drive to a 300 GB PATA Maxtor. Unfortunately, the software failed during the clone process despite several attempts -- perhaps a 137GB issue? I punted, using the CD included with the Maxtor drive, which incidentally worked great.I then tried cloning my ancient HP laptop's drive to a new 60GB 2.5"" PATA drive. The Avanquest software seemed to back up all the partitions with no errors, but the cloned drive would not boot when reinstalled in the laptop. I don't know whether that was due to HP's hard drive configuration or a problem with the Avanquest software.I then used the Avanquest to upgrade my wife's desktop to the 80GB drive I'd upgraded my desktop from. The Avanquest software worked great in this application, and was worth the money I spent -- but one success out of three attempts isn't that impressive."
2,Doesn't work well,"I tried to use this to clone a drive to upgrade to a 250g hd. It failed three times. Finally it kinda worked, but ended up only recognizing 133g. The leftover space was recognized by windows xp and I formatted as a second partition, but when I put the DC&C; disk back in, DC&C; read it as a damage partition, disabled all function but delete, and then delete failed. Needless to say, this one will go back to the store.It would really be nice if retailers would trial the sw they sell to weed out the junk. One would think if we pay $$ for sw at a so called reputable retailer, it should work seamlessly. If I wanted junk I could get it free online."
1,Waste of time and money,"I tried two computers with Vista installed, it doesn't work.In one PC, DCC exit before the first screen. In the other PC, even though I get the initial screen mouse and keyboard doesn't work.Looks like it is a toy application. Not sure if they ever tested against Vista."
1,Graco Car Seat Undermat,"My husband and I purchased these, we thought they would be perfect for under our Graco car seats. We had the car seat bases professionally installed in our cars, and the professionals told us that we couldn't use the undermats. The car seat base slides around and isn't secure with the mat underneath it. I was told this would be the same situation for a toddler car seat."

1,NO!!!!!! permanent filter!!!!,VERY disappointed as it clearly states permanent filter and there clearly wasn't any.in the box I tried to get in contact with the manufacturer and amazon with no respond to my emails
2,Warning!,"The coffee maker is fine, except in one important aspect. When pouring out the hot coffeee, the lid tends to open, allowing very hot steam to reach your hand. To prevent this, you need to pour very slowly so that the angle of the pot is minimal.I actually wonder why the coffee maker does not come with a warning, as there is a serious potential for injury."
3,Average coffeemaker,"I bought one of these two years ago. It has served me well, with a couple of exceptions. (1) The clock - has no battery backup. If you lose power, you have to reset the clock. (2) A MUCH more major issue is the unit's annoying ""feature"" that turns itself off in 2 hours. This may be an attractive feature for some, and at first two hours sounded like a long time. In the end, though, I found I would have maybe 2 cups of hot coffee before it would turn itself off. I'd end up having to nuke the remaining cups."
4,Excellent Except for>>>>,We love this coffee maker. It makes VERY HOT coffee which we have found not to be the case with most of drip type coffee makers. It brews delicious coffee as well. The only thing that I would improve is the ability to fill with water before brewing. The space is designed in a way that it is near impossible not to spill some water when filling. There just isnt enough space to pour. Otherwise its a great product.
1,Horrible smelling,"I got this the other day and really was pleased with the way that it looked when I opened the package. I had to put it on right away. I was only able to wear it for maybe 1/2 an hour before I couldn't anymore, you see it has a really weird, bad odor to it. As I was taking it off the extender broke in half and then the next thing you know there was beads flying off from the necklace. So needless to say at first I thought this necklace was great because it looks so cute, but it is so cheaply made, and that smell is gross. Just goes to show that looks can be deceiving. If I were you I wouldn't waste money on this. I am sending it back because I don't feel it's fair to pay $10 for something that pretty much instantaneously broke."
3,Kokopelli's Flute,"I read Kokopelli's flute a few weeks ago. When I finished, which was after a couple days, i enjoyed it. it had an intriguing plot, and was exciting. The story-line kept me interested, but I thought that the book lacked depth. its was kind of fluffy, and aimed wards children. I did enjoy the literary componets of the corporate developability. I only gave the book 3 stars out of five, for the lack of personal connection, and charactor development.My compliments to the author."
4,Kokopelli's Flute Review,"Kokopelli's Flute was a great book! There was lots of mysterious thngs going on in the book. I'd recommend this book for ages 9+. I wouldn't recommend this book to ages 8 and younger because it takes a lot of thinking,and many things are going at once. It's about a boy named Tepary that goes into the ruins that belong to the Anasazi,and finds interesting but not very thoughtful POTHUNTERS!! Read the book and find out what happens to the pothunters. I give this a four star because,because it is hard to undrestand in some parts(confusing) but clear at the end. I hope you read this book."
4,Kokopeli's Flute {L.C},Kokopelli’s Flute was a great book. It has magic and problems that have amazing solutions to them. I would definitely give this book a 4 star rate because it’s really exciting and cool. Even though I think it’s a great book I would not recommend it for children under 10 years old because they probably would not get the ideas in the book and all of the confusing words. Also if you are studying the Native Americans I would recommend this book for a lot of different reasons. One of them would be that it talks about the Southwest Native Americans a lot so you learn about their traditions and culture . So that’s why I recommend this book highly.
4,Jordan R .,"Wow! I just got done reading ""Kokopelli's Flute"" and I thougt it was grrreat but confusing book, that is why I gave it a 4 star. Kokopelli's Flute is kind of like a bunch of stories about the Anassazi with the same characters put together. The story was mysterious and I did not want to put it down. Though it is confusing, it is still a good book! I would higly recommend this book for ages 9 and up, and for people who are interested in the Southwest Native Americans. It's about a boy who meets a mysterious person. Soon the boy finds out that the mysterious person is also someone very special. But you have to read ""Kokopellis Flute to find out who that special person is!!"
4,"Good, but REALLY wierd.","A really weird book is usually good, and this is no exception. Will Hobbs' specialty is adventure, and this is his prime of writing. Although not the best book, it is really good. I only did not like the species change. Creepy!"
4,Kokopelies Flute (K.F.),"I think Kokopelli's Flute should get four stars.It is non-fiction and is about a boy who transforms into a desert animal. It takes place in New Mexico and the boy's name is Tepary Jones. While it is a great book it is a little confusing so I don't recommend it for children under the age of ten. If you read the book you'll find out why Tepary turns into a desert animal. If you are interested in desert plants,animals,and Native Americans this will be a great book for you."
4,A great read for Native American story lovers!,"""Kokopelli's Flute,"" by Will Hobbs is a wonderful book for kids who like Native American books. I recommend it for animal lovers. Well, I don't want to spoil it, but Tepary Jones (the main character) blows a few notes on an ancient flute, so every night Tep turns into a pack rat. And, it's pretty exciting! So if you like exciting books, you should definitely read this!Will Hobbs writes ""Kokopelli's Flute"" very well. Although it is a bit slow going in the beginning, the middle and the end of the book are funny. If you like books with evil people who get outsmarted by kids, read this book. Also in the book there are some scary parts! I really suggest this book for fourth graders.Logan H.Grade 3Kokopelli's Flute"
3,Childs book report,This book was selected from a teacher for a 14 year olds book reportgood reading.
4,Not the first two seasons,Not the same writing quality of the first two seasons. The writers want the series to end with everyone happy.
5,Beautiful Blue Mystic,"There is a t-shirt that reads: ""Stage is life, motion pictures are art, and television is furniture"". However, there are always the exceptions. ""Beautiful Blue Mystic"", an episode in this collection, is one of those gems of TV history. It is worth seeing even if ""The Guardian"" isn't your typical fare (although it helps to see a reasonable amount of the shows as the plot to this particular episode builds up from the others.Innovative, breath-taking, and mind-blowing are all adjectives that can be used to describe that particular episode. It's difficult to expound on it without giving a critical element away, but the bottomline is: If you are a fan of ""The Guardian"" this is the crown jewel of the series. If you are new to the series you will find the entire third season outstanding, but particularly come away from ""Beautiful Blue Mystic"" believing you have just seen one of the finest hours in television history."
5,Always Enjoyable,"This is a no-brainer; if you enjoyed the first two seasons, you'll want to watch the third and final. There were some character surprises, but in general, the story lines mirrored the first two seasons without much change."
4,Beautiful and Handy,"I ordered the Portmeirion Botanic Garden creamer to replace one, from my set, that I dropped and broke. The creamer is beautiful and just the right size for my needs. My only complaint is that the spout is shaped to cause a slight dribble under the spout after pouring. I've gotten into the habit of wiping the dribble with my napkin or a tissue after using, but that is a slight annoyance. That said, I still like the creamer for being microwave safe, but I like it especially for the ""educational"" feature of common and scientific names of the forget-me-not decoration. I enjoy pointing out to guests how having a meal with us on the Botanic Garden tableware is not only good for body and soul but also good for supplementing their education!"
1,THE WORST INVESTMENT I EVER MADE...,"Crashed after 4 days. Lost all data on the hard drive. Contacted customer service at Aegis, you would think that someone would care to answer !!! Of course not, why answer the customer, once he has bought this piece of junk and it has crashed, why should anyone at Aegis care.I would not recommend this hard drive even if it was the only hard drive available in the market"
2,"Built-in USB is Good, but..","I blowed up all the data.I don't know it was my fault or defect of this product.But, I lost every Thing, I didn't made a backup.I was so frustrated.Built-in cable is worth of money. Very useful.I don't have to carry messy cabels.The case looks so cheap, compared to WD. but, It is more expensive."
5,Flawless after 19 months of rugged use,"In my graduate program we were each given one of these drives when we start school. That was 19 months ago and I've been hauling mine around in my backpack almost every day since then. The thing just keeps on working. I've never even heard of the company that makes these things but all I know is mine has taken it's share of abuse and had no problems.I haven't done any formal tests, but like another reviewer said the thing seems pretty fast.I do also really like the fact that the usb cord is built in. I don't know why western digital and the bunch don't at least offer drives like this.Good product."
5,"35 Harpsichord Favorites, Three Harpsichords","Kipnis plays 35 varied harpsichord pieces on three different harpsichords, with a variety of tunings to present each piece at its best. It became a family favorite as soon as I put it on.The liner notes are particularly good. The harpsichords (Contemporary copies of Italian, Flemish and French instruments) are described, then the methods of tuning.Modern keyboard instruments are tuned in a sort of average way so they sound pretty good in any key. Some of the pieces are played with such a ""well-tempered"" tuning but others have a mean-tone tuning that gives a nicer sound in the common notes of the key it's tuned for, but won't sound good if you deviate from the commonly used notes of that key. I think I can hear the difference the tuning makes. There is also nice info on the pieces."
4,The australian heart of darkness,"ive always been fascinated by this story ,the economy of language usedis very dry ,very australian. If there is a more australian book ive yet to find it .Something that has always interested me , when the books maincharacter Grant? keeps getting horribly pissed and waking up toextraordaniary hangovers, on the second morning he complains ofsome terrible thing that has happened to him during his sleep apartfrom the obvious hangover, is it being suggested that the character played(very well) by donald plesanse? has molested grant somehow during hissleep? Does anybody else see this, it seems something very disturbinghappened and ive always wondered?"
2,Where's my carafe?,"I bought this coffeemaker to replace an older Mr. Coffee. When switching out the two, I noticed the carafe seemed too small to hold twelve cups, so I measured both carafes. The older carafe counts a ""cup"" as five ounces, whereas the Proctor-Silex carafe counts a ""cup"" as four ounces, making their ""12 cup"" carafe more of a ten cup carafe. I call that false advertising. Also, the coffee is very weak even when set on the strongest setting."
1,Disappointed,"We normally use a very basic, non-programmable coffee maker. When our current one bought the farm, we intended to replace it with the exact same model. Right beside it was this Procter-Silex model for almost 10 bucks less so we decided to give it a try. Not a good decision. The brew selector dial did little if anything to change the strength of coffee. The scoop provided was a bit bigger than our previous one but the instructions said to use one per cup whereas with our previous model we used one scoop for two cups. Any money we saved on this coffee maker would have been lost in the fact that this unit needs twice as many coffee grounds to brew the same amount of coffee. We took it back to exchange for the Black and Decker model with which we've had good luck in the past."
2,Can't get rid of foul taste,"There is something inside that's tainting the flavor of the coffee. You can smell it while it's brewing. I figured it was just the ""new"" smell but it persists. I've cleaned it twice with vinegar... no help."
3,A helpful little book in times of need,"This is a little book containing various (many) examples of affirmative prayer (about a page for each prayer) for use on specific occasions when help might be required.In general I greatly appreciate Joseph Murphy's books, but didn't get so much out of this one, since it's not designed for reading from beginning to end, which is what I did.Here is a sentence from one of the prayers:""Divine Love flowing from me blesses all who come into my atmosphere.""Many will appreciate this litle book, others may not."
3,Sent to me NOT working,"I have NO idea if this watch is good or not... my daughter opened it on Christmas morning for me to find it NOT working... I'm not sure if its the battery or what but THANKS A LOT!this was ""The Gift"" this year and it was a Crappy experience to find it not working!"
5,Repair your own and Save$$$,The DVD has more video than advertised. Just when we were done watching one we found another set of videos not mentioned and now find a complete and thorough guide with walk thru How to`s. I would buy again if this were somehow lost. Excellent and for the average Joe.
2,Not worth the money--Even as a gift,"Why do people who write books about amps think that I want to know what a transformer even looks like? I just want to to make the best tone I possibly can with my amp without taking the chassis out. And coming from a guy who has the funniest you tube video shocking himself, while explaining to be careful not to be shocked... I have to admit that didn't finish watching the entire video. This was given to me as a gift and I should have returned it for an amazon refund before I took off the shrink wrap. But the cover is impressive. And Gerald seems like a really nice guy."
5,Great Value,"It was a great price, fit the way it said it would, and worked great for our program. Many local costume shops were charging twice as much for similar costumes."
2,What happened to the groove?,"Not quite infectious at all. I know it's not the infectefibian thing but it's still not up to par for these guys. Sorry but loose these tendencies & get back to the nasty stinky funky,make your boogers go south for the winter infecto groovalistico sock it to me jams that these guys are quite capable of. I think I speak for many when I say BRING BACK ALLADIN SILLIMINAGIC JACKSON DA THIRD!"
5,John P. Cutler,"I've been a fan of the Vienna Boys Choir for many years. I have over fifty of their recordings. But before I purchased this book, the only thing I knew of them was what I read on the LP's & CD's that I own. This is the only book I've seen, written in English, that tells of their history. I never knew the difficulties that they've endured throughout their hstory, especially during world war two. If You're a fan of the Vienna Boys Choir, as I am, then I think this book will help You know more about them. I believe You will enjoy ths book very much."
4,A Good Read!,"If you're looking for someone to tell you to quit that hum-drum job and go find your true self, look elsewhere. William and Rosemary Salmon have written a book for the moderately alienated masses who have lost their enthusiasm for a job that once sparked their imaginations. Like a tune-up for your car, routine career maintenance can improve your performance. The tools the authors use are communication, relationships and continuous self-improvement. While these habits certainly are worthy, they are not particularly groundbreaking. Readers hoping for a complete career-engine overhaul won't find it here. But if what you need is some routine servicing to get the cylinders firing again, we at ... recommend this book to you."
4,4 1/2 stars,"It would be a 5, if the original music was kept in and not this horrible unknown stuff that doesn't fit it the scenes"
5,"Out of 10 seasons of 90210, this is the 2nd best!","I was a huge fan on 90210 when it originally came out when I was 19. I've seen every episode and Season Two I think is the 2nd best series out of the 10 years it was on air. I am waiting to buy Season Three as this is the best one of all (What a shocker when Kelly steals Dylan away from Brenda for years!) These are great shows as Brenda has her pregnancy scare and her parents find out, Steve goes in search of his birth mother, Emily Valentine goes beserk, Scott is killed off (thankfully as the actor who played him was atrocious), and Kelly and David become step-siblings. You'll love this excellent series just as I do 17 years later!"
1,Not the real thing,I'm so glad I read the reviews and learned that these aren't the real deal. The music was a big part of the show. Without it--I'm not buying this. Too bad. I've been in a 90210 nostalgia mood lately. Maybe one day the series will be released on DVD.
1,Do not buy this DVD,"The producers have take out all music. Scenes that were once great like the Time of my life skating scene has been replaced with some unknown music. It is a shame because that was a great scene. I know they have some copyright issues but pay the extra bucks and if you are going to sell the second season, show it on dvd how it appeared on tv. Don't change the music with elevator music!!!"
5,my favorite show,Of course this show is awesome the only thing that doesn't make any sense are the cut scenes and the change of the music. Otherwise it is a great buy!!
3,Bought as gift ...,Bought as gift so no review from purchaser available. Was fulfilling Christmas gift list.
5,I LOVE 90210!!!,"I just got finished watching my season one dvd set & can't wait for season 2 to come out in May! There is only one problem---the music was changed in season one! It was really lame! I mean, half the time the music didn't even go along with the scene! Anyone else agree?"
5,Fantastic,"Beverly Hill 90210 is as much fun now as it was back when it came out! It's funny to see on this season how the microphone pops into the top view of the screen in a lot of the episodes, but it doesnt ruin the show. Quality product, can't wait for season 3!!"
4,SEASON 2 GOOD! SEASON # IS BETTER!!!!!!,"While I enjoyed season 1 and 2, Season 3, and 10 are by far the best seasons. When will season 3 be released????????? Does anyone know??? Season 3 is when Brenda goes to Paris and Dylon and Kelly hook up for the first time. Please hurry will season 3!!!!!"
2,Don't like the show that much and if the music was replaced I'll like it less and won't buy it.,"I'm so sick and tired of the studios editing old shows and others recent on DVD and change the original soundtrack!seriously what's the use in this exept getting on a couple of fans nerves?! (I know it's expensive but didn't they earn enough money while it was aired on TV?!) I mean some shows aren't that great but it music are huge and one of it interest depends on this,so if you change them with uninteresting ones there's nothing left to like about the show exept maybe the actors and still sometimes it's not enough.I bough the first box set and won't buy the rest cause the changing of original songs is bad and a couple of ""new scenes"" are just plain and dumb.Just watch the reruns or download it.If editors can steal us,why can't we?..."
3,Quitaron la música original,"Me encanta el show, lo he grabado y visto mil veces, y queria tenerlo en DVD, pero la música importante ha sido toda retirada por simples fondos musicales sin autor. Esto hace de las escenas que sean realmente diferentes. Se que costarían mas los DVDs con la música original, pero creo que nosotros los consumidores estariamos mas comodos pagando un poco mas por un producto mejor."
2,There are better choices in historical fiction,"Historical mysteries seem to be a growth industry right now, and in any quickly-expanding field you're going to get some clunkers. Despite a high body count - half a dozen people are dead before the story even gets going - there's no sense of menace or suspense here. Doherty's writing style is breezy, but gives little character insight or feel for ancient Egyptian life. If you must read a historical mystery set in Egypt, I'd recommend the Lord Meren series over this. Even better, try either of the ancient Roman detective series (by Davis and Saylor) for a far better mystery experience."
3,fun mystery series,"This is PC Doherty's mystery/detective series, with the lead character a judge, under Pharaoh Hatshepsut, the female pharaoh. ( He refers to her by another form of her name: Hatusu ). Judge Amerotke seeks to solve crimes with the usual group of helpers/ sidekicks. Not as good as Mr. Doherty's more serious books, but light and easy reading, especially if you like mysteries and detective novels. There are multiple books in this series, and I hope he continues to write more."
3,I won't be looking for the next volume,"I was really looking forward to a book with Hatshepsut in it, but this was a disappointment, both in its portrayal of her and the feeble plot. Hatshepsut remains pretty controversial, even today, and Doherty's character just doesn't strike me as a plausible imagining of the woman.I don' think this next paragraph is a spoiler, since it comes up pretty early in the book. I simply cannot understand how she could be so easily blackmailed. How on earth could the blackmailer prove the charge? Who (that could hurt her) would believe it anyway, particularly since the threats begin while her husband is still alive? It wouldn't have been in Thutmosis' interest to to believe it, whatever evidence was offered. This isn't a society where the blackmailer can go on a talk show. In Egypt at this time, would it have mattered that much even if it was true? O.K. for passing time, but not a great addition to the genre."
4,Very Good!,Just finished this book last night and I really enjoyed it. The story was well written and the charactors interesting and believable - I will definitly look for more books by P C Doherty!
2,disappointed,"I am an avid reader of ancient Egyptian mysteries, and have read every one that I could find, including Peters, Haney and Robinson, whose works I consider to be very entertaining. It was with great expectations that I read The Mask of Ra--and I was quite disappointed. Mr. Doherty takes too many liberties with historical facts. I guess I should have been fairly warned by the character's names--very UN-Egyptian!Besides having his own way with history, Mr. Doherty is, in my opinion, a poor author. His descriptive powers lack any emotion, and his descriptions of his characters lacks any verve.The only thing this novel has in merit is to warn me against reading any further works from Doherty."
3,"Okay, but..",When we bought this product we thought it would have a better microphone with it. The sound quality was great but the mic left something to be desired.
2,Not thrilled.,"Bass was good. High end sounds were distorted and rather harsh. Didn't fit my head for beans and i found then very uncomfortable to wear. If i had only saved the packaging i would have sent them back, so i gave them away. I purchased the tritton AX51 pro's and couldn't be happier for the moment. I expected something better from the name sennheiser considering there reputation. By the way i run a high end pc with a creative x-fi extreme sound card."
2,Disappointment.,"This was a disappointment....i originally had the pc150 headphones which were amazing, but the in-line volume decided to quit on me, so i had intermitting sound. I saw this pair and got excited because the pc160 series are the ones with the usb attachment, which is useful for people with a crappy sound card (or no card lol). Unfortunately when these showed up on my stoop they did NOT have the usb sound card. Another problem with these headphones is that the earcups are VERY UNcomfortable, where my pc150 ones rocked even with hours of CS:S playing :DDo yourself a favor and skip these..."
4,Very good product by Sennheiser,"I bought this headset because I'm taking a class on the internet that requires one. Classes are long (3-4 hours) and overall I'm very pleased with this headset. The comfort is top-notch and the sound quality is very good. The only small gripe I have about the headset is the earcups do not swivel (like the Bose QC 3's) which would provide a little more flexibility for the headset to fit squarely around the ears. However, the around-ear design proves more comfort for long-wear (compared with Bose QC3). The ""open-air"" allows sound to pass through the earcups from outside, perfect because I want to be able to hear my fiancee talking to me while I'm taking the class. Overall, excellent product!"
4,Great Sounds...,but no noise cancellation. I was looking for a high quality headset for gaming and movies and I think I've found the best quality/price ratio with this set. For the money I'm extremely happy with the performance and the only reason I give it 4 stars is because I can hear everything thats going on in the house with them on.The mic is crystal clear and the controls seem to be well made. The over all construction is a little flimsy but not as bad as others I've owned.The ear cups are a little small for my ears but comfy none the less. I can wear them non stop for about 4 hours before they have to come off. Keep in mind my ears are fairly large. So if you're looking for a headset with ear cups to completely cover your ears look elsewhere (unless your ears are tiny).The next time I purchase a headset it will be something very similar to these if this model is no longer available.
4,Performed to expectations,"Things you should know before buying:-Supra aural, sits on your ears so you can hear everything that is going on around you, thats a good thing at a lan party however.-8 foot long chord and inline mic control and volume are nice, you may accidentally change the volume by rubbing up against the volume control (-half star)- The chord and mic are on the left side of the headset and is noticed by adding a bit of weight that results in readjustments if you are turning your head often enough (-half star).Overall:If you just bought these you will enjoy them if you are ready for open headphones that feel like little couches sitting on your ears."
5,Great for gaming & music,"This is my second pair of these headphones and I love them. The original pair was finally run over too many times with the office chair after 2 years. The sound quality if excellent is the headset is comfortable to wear during long sessions. If you are listening to music or playing a game that has no chat and you don't need the micropone boom, just pivot it up and it gets out of the way nicely. The recorong quality of the mic is also very good and all my freinds can hear me load and clear. In a few years when this one is beaten beyond repair, I know what brand I will be buying again!"
5,One of the best!,"Loved the book! It's a great package - humorous, fast-paced, and sizzles -- just as Love & Laughter should be!"
1,False advertisement,The cover states to be Rain-Tite. Well the cover did not protect my table from the rain. When I lifted the cover the entire table was covered with wetness. If I waited any longer the table would have gotten mildew. This product is horrible.
1,Outdoor Patio Table Cover,I am very disappointed with this product. It is not waterproof at all. It does not do more to protect my outdoor table than a fitted sheet would do -- and it costs a lot more!
4,It works.,Have had it on the table for a few weeks and has not blown off. Seems to be keeping dirt off the table. Will know for sure in spring.
5,Fabulous,"Another addition to the story of friends Lacey, Chelsea, Amanda, Jillian and Katie, its a must-read. Chelsea is on the beeper for a heart transplant, and staying with Katie's family. Katie's success with a heart transplant gives Chelsea hope, but after living with a heart disease her entire life, Chelsea is getting sicker each day. At a class for hopeful tranplant receipiants, Chelsea meets Jillian, a sassy, up-beat red-head with a Texan twang and a rich father. Jillian is not only in need of a heart, but a 'pair of lungs.' Jillian and Chelsea can relate, and become instant friends. But one night both girls' beepers go... but there's only one heart, and two lungs. Do the doctors save three people, or one?"
4,A story in which you must have a tissue to read,"Chelsea James has just moved onto a beeper for a heart transplant and is staying with her friend from the summer, Katie O'Roark. Chelsea is in a support group, and there she meets Jillian, who is awaiting a heart-lung transplant. Jillian and Chelsea become the best of friends. When they are both beeped for the same heart, the hospital must choose only one of them. Who will it be?"
1,Not the best book you'll find for teenagers,"If you are looking for a good, tear-jerking story that makes you care about the characters, you will need to look elsewhere. ""She Died Too Young"" features perfect characters that are miserable because they all need organ transplants to live. Both reach a critical stage, and surprise! there's only one set of organs! So one of the two has to die. And of course, there are a couple of flawless, gorgeous guys waiting around for the girls. Please don't waste your time or money on this book--save a tree."
1,Pre-soap opera material,"Spare me please! I read this book when I was younger because a friend gave it to me. I read it and hated it, and this friend tried to get me to read the rest but I quit halfway through the next book because it was the same song and dance, just different names. You can easily predict the one to die. One has got to go, but they both love each other, there's some Ken-Doll look alike dating one of them, usually another guy who's on the trail of the other girl, and in the end one dies and the other lives. Wahh. Just like every other book in the series. If you've read one, you've read them all."
5,Great,This is a great CD. Has both live and studio CD's. Steve Goodman is a wonderful writer and a good singer. The album will make you laugh and singer along. Jethro Burns on the mandelin is an excellent addition.
4,A nice collection,"I truely enjoy this CD. The studio CD is a five star CD, clearly a masterpeice. The live CD doesn't capture Steve Goodman as well as some of the recordings done during his life; but is still a very worthwhile addition to any collection."
1,Wack Beyond Belief,"J-Lo is tone deaf period&even with LL Cool J on vocals can't cover up the Horror.Debra Laws did this song back in 1981&this is one of those songs you don't touch&especially when you can't Sing.J-Lo is solid Eye Candy, but Vocally&Acting no thank you.even the Video was Cheese."
4,"Fun and helpful, but way too much product placement!","I can only chime in with others--there were wonderful natural cleaning tips, involving ingredients like vinegar, salt, lemon juice, etc., but I was appalled at the blatant product placement. I had caught Kim and Aggie's British episodes, perhaps on BBC TV, and loved their humor and willingness to tackle some of the biggest slobs in England. Their trademark humor is present in these American episodes, but the product placement is very in-your-face. Still, I enjoy Kim and Aggie and their cleaning tips, and for fans this 4-disc collection is well worth the price."
2,how clean is your house?,I don't see any closed caption (CC) or Subtitled for the deaf / hard of hearing (SDH) on a dvd. What happen to them? Remember that more than 50 millions of people are hearing impaired in this America CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT CC OR SDH.
3,Until the BBC version comes out...,"...then this will have to do.I was so excited to see this available. I didn't read the reviews until after the fact and had no idea this started in the U.S. on Lifetime. The BBC America version is FAR, FAR, FAR better. In the BBC version the houses are dirtier, the voiceover guy is better and they use home cleaning solutions (like vinegar and lemon juice) rather than any name brands. I don't think the product placement is as obnoxious as other reviewers and they did use beeswax on the wood so it isn't all about the product placement.If you like the show and want a fix but do not have BBC America on cable this will suffice until the BBC releases DVD version of the REAL show that we have all come to know and love. This version is merely adequate."
5,Great machine for the price,I've had this blender for about a month and it does what it's supposed to. I use it mainly for smoothies or sauces: it crushes ice easily and efficiently.No problem so far.
4,Wonderful Blender,"I have been using my WaveLogic Blender for about a month now and I love it. We use it for making smoothies and it works wonderful. It blends the frozen fruit and mixes the ice very well. My last blender was a Hamilton Beach also, but it did not compare to this new one. It did not blend our ice. It left huge hunks in our smoothies. The WaveLogic method is truly something to watch.I also like the hassle free shopping through Amazon. I was a frist time shopper at Amazon, but I surely use them again."
1,WaveLogic Blender,"I needed a new blender since I use one every day. I have no issues with the operation of the blender, but I have been continually frustrated with the rubber gasket that seals the jar; it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to know when it is securely sealed until all the liquid comes dribbling out (and it does it a LOT).I'd LOVE to find one that is easier to assemble and clean, and one that has a secure seal. The only way I use it now is to 'test' it with water before I put juice in it."
1,Poor Performer,"What a disappointment. This blender was purchased because of the good reviews it had. Unfortunately, the 40 year old blender, it was to replace, outperforms it dramatically. The main reason for purchasing it was to crush ice for drinks. It never fully crushes all the ice, even with its ""special"" ice crusher button. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"This is just a piece of crab.I brought it back to the store.It does not do the job at all. The wave-action that promises ongoing blending and chopping is a joke. It does not do anything.This blender did not even chopped small pieces of cauliflower, which is really not very hard to chopp.The overall appearance is CHEAP. The performance is POOR."
1,Can't replace o ring,You can't the o ring if you tried. Trying to open the bottom is impossible. Save your time and buy an Oster. Don't make the same mistake I did.
2,Leaks too much,"Good strong casing, but the wave motion gimmick created by the shape accelerates the liquids too much, and in tandem with the relatively highly tuned speed settings, this blender frequently hits the lid with your blendings. The lid then sprays stuff out in various directions in thin, high speed streams. I would not recommend this blender although I have used other Hamilton Beach blenders with success, and I do so every day. This one just happens to suck because it is tuned to spin too fast, and then the lid can't even keep the contents from spraying out."
3,pretty good blender for price,"The blender seems to work well for the price. I'm wondering about the plastic pitcher. seems to me like it would look classier/nicer if it was glass, but the plastic is lighter which is nice. not sure how long lasting this blender will be so i guess we'll see. seems to chop ice and make smoothies pretty well as it should with such a powerful motor."
3,A Radiant Idea,"There is a lot of information and inspiration in this book. I resonate with a lot of what Gabriel Cousens has to say, and emanate. I have been a little deterred by what I question as fully being accessible to others and walking the talk in a way that embraces the many who are curious and in need of healing their relationship with food and life as those are intricately connected, if not the same thing. Lots of potent and insightful suggestions and there is a gentleness that is evident in his books. If you are drawn to his books, I would recommend them, always making use of your own guidance and intuition to know which suggestions are right for you."
