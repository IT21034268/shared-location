5,WOW!,This book is one of the best books that I have ever read. It kept me interested throughout the book. The author did an amazing job on discussing tough issues within the Christian church. I learned so much from this book and I will recommend it to anyone because this book will do a lot in the life of a person. It will change their outlook on the traditional church! Amazing Job! Great Book!
3,"Well-Written, Suspenseful Story","Pastor Jason Faircloth is loved by his congregation, but at home he is an arrogant, cold-hearted bullying know-it-all. He drives his daughter away from home by his over-bearing rules, and destroys his relationship with his wife. Now he has been brought face to face with a disaster that causes him to even doubt his faith in God. There is a tendency to blame the ""organized church"" for Jason's problems, instead of recognizing we each make our own decisions whether to trust God or to put our faith in man-made rules. Legalism has always been a problem in the church. It was a problem back in Jesus' time, but the problem isn't always the church. Sometimes it's us. A lesson Jason Faircloth has to learn, and like most of us, he learns it the hard way.A well-written, suspenseful story of one man's journey away from living by his own rules, and of his discovery of the riches of receiving grace and mercy from a loving God."
5,A timeless story that gripped me as a husband and a father!,"Even after 4-5 years, this book still stirs my emotions as consider the overbearing, legalistic preacher-father who drove his daughter from him. Later, broken and disillusioned, he rejects God & his own faith as he desperately searches for a new grand daughter he has never known. Along the way, though not seeking it, he also discovers what real ""wisdom"" is and what God is really like--not a machine to be manipulated as he originally thought. The twists & turns keep the book in your hands and wring your emotions dry, leaving you longing for a sequel at the end. Outstanding writing!"
3,Core message lost in sloppy writing,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. However, as a teacher of English as a second/foreign language in southeast Asia, I was appalled at how the author portrayed the Burmese pastor's speech. The man spoke in third person, repeating his own name many times within one paragraph. The character was putting forth the entire core message of the book and yet it was lost in childish third person recitation. The speech patter was not authentic at all to me and it made me work ""too hard"" to understand what was being said.I realize that this book was written almost 20 years ago, so perhaps understanding of how others learn English is more clear now and the same mistake wouldn't be made if the book were being written today."
5,"A moving, compelling and grasping story !","Evidently Randall Arthur writes from experience. Everything is believable because we've all been through similar human and spiritual circumstance. The amazing thing to me was this book was published in 1991 and makes mention of church multiplication by division and small groups, ie a cell based church. I've been immersed in this very Biblical concept and have read many recently published books. It works!Randall is a gifted writer weaving a tale of personal and spiritual woe and in the end, triumph of GOD. We taarry in HIS vision because HE will not fail in spite of us !!"
1,Not even sealed...,"I don't know from what planet these guys are from but the honey arrives in tiny jars that are not even sealed... and the lid comes of very easy (just to make things worse). As far as I am concerned, they can put inside whatever they want - there is no way to prove that the contents is the intended one or if it ever was in France (as they claim). 100% pure junk!As the jars are not even sealed, they might add poison as well or spit in your honey - just for the kicks of it! Why would anyone in his right mind expose him/herself or the family to such low class, dangerous product?!"
5,Shrimp with Herbs..AWSOME!!!,"I've had this cookbook for over 30 years and still refer to it for great tasting, down-home recipes. One of my favorites is found on page 39: ""Shrimp with Herbs"" - a better shrimp scampi-type recipe is hard to find, better than restaurant quality! The difference is that it has one chopped tomato in it, scallions and black pepper. It is also not drowning in butter, which is one of my pet peeves even in high-end restaurants. Try these recipes...you won't be sorry."
1,Department 56 12 Days of Christmas,Department 56 needs to learn how to sing the twelve days of christmas! It is not 9 drummers drumming it is 12 drummers drumming and 9 ladies dancing. The ornaments are darling but need to be set in line with the song.
5,The recording *is* available,"If you like one Concerto Palatino album, you'll want them all. This CD has been discontinued, but all its contents are available as part of this 2 CD set:Italian Music for Cornets and Trombones (1580-1680)"
3,Harmless but useful,"An upbeat glorified phrase book. Only an idiot would undertake to learn a language using material like this. OTOH, plenty of useful information for the not-particularly-adventurous planning a trip. The CD was defective on a couple of tracks.The Dummies series generally has a good reputation. The books are what they are, and if you buy them with your eyes wide open and your expectations dialed in modestly, they can serve their purpose. This volume conforms completely to the general approach, and in that sense it's outstanding."
5,This book is a real blessing,"I am totally satisfied with this purchase in every aspect. The material quality of the book is better than I expected it to be. I though Chinese was going to be very difficult to learn but once you get the consonant & vowel sounds down, it's a piece of cake. This takes a little work and time and I would advise anybody targeting this language to commit to this section of the book until they have it reasonably memeorized. After that, it's a breeze thanks to the transliteration by which you can check yourself. Also, there are some really good Chinese movies with subtitles and when you start to realize you are starting to understand what's being said, you'll be giggling like a kid in a candy factory. Good luck with it."
2,A good 2nd book,"This book suffers from two problems. One is that it throws readers directly into conversation and overwhelms them. I used the book to pick up a few cultural niceties, but my Chinese friends laughed at my failure to use the correct tones. The other problem is that it is shoehorned into the Dummies framework of organizing books rather than trying to absolute novices the basics first. This book has good appendixes and other reference material. It would be a great second book after you have mastered another approach of learning basic Chinese. I quickly ditched this approach, and bought the Pimsleur series."
2,Less than 4270 pages in one volume which covers only a certain number of letters.,"The book is not 4270 pages. In fact, not only is it much less than that, but also, each page has two columns and the book for some strange reason counts each column as a separate page."
1,These are Toys!,"I bought two sets of these to work on my 4-ball juggling. I couldn't be more dissapointed. As stated, they all weigh differently, and they are about the size of hackey sacks These ARE NOT good juggling balls. They are kids toys...."
1,I never received the juggling balls.,I ordered the juggling balls a few months ago to teach my new 4 month old puppy how to catch things in her mouth. At the same time I ordered clickers to teach her clicker training. Since that time she has been successfully clicker trained. As for the balls I never received them. So I can rate the seller as terrible since I paid for something I never got.
2,Good juggling balls for a child,"From the balls pictured I expected something about the size of a golf ball and weighing 50 grams to 100 grams. These balls are a little bit bigger than a golf ball and about the same weight. They are not all packed with the same amount of material and therefore each ball weighs a different amount.For these reasons these would be great for a child looking to play with 3 balls and possibly be introduced to juggling, but not for anyone who is older than 12."
3,Tiny little suckers,"I can't comfortably use these to juggle because they're too darn small. I got a set of three from an event that were perfect, so I decided to get three more online so I can start to learn to juggle more than 3 balls, but when these came, they were really small. I have big hands, and I just use these to play with my daughter. If anyone knows which of the 600 juggling balls listed on amazon are good (just like these only big enough to fill your hand), please let me know. Thanks."
2,Not A Very Good Set Of Juggling Balls,"I don't think I'd recommend these for a beginner or anyone, really. They are very light and not a very good quality. They are very difficult to get used to; at least I find. I'm an intermediate juggler and would not recommend these balls. One of the balls has a tag that you need to cut off. They don't feel good in the hands and are not very easy to catch."
3,These are super cheap,"You get what you pay for. I needed to learn to juggle quickly and these were available with two day free shipping from prime. Shipped out and arrived super fast, and the price was cheap. But so are the balls. After three days the seams were coming apart on one. I ordered two more sets because I couldn't really afford to wait for long shipping. I've been alternating my juggling practice with the first two sets for the last five days, and two balls are literally falling apart. But I suspect I will have three relatively intact juggling balls by the end of the week. Long term, I'll need to find something higher quality, as it appears multiple drops from five feet off the ground is all it takes before these start to fall apart."
1,Good for about 7 seconds....not worth the price.,Got these for a little stress relief and fun. Stitching came apart on 2 balls within 2 days of very lite use.
2,meh,"These balls are light and not durable at all. After some light use, the stitching started to come loose, and the inner flakes of stuff started to leak out."
3,"Economy Bags, not Consistent Size or Weight","To reiterate what other reviewers have stated, these balls are not consistent size or weight. However, they are an inexpensive juggling prop for the beginner and the inconsistency issues can somewhat be addressed by purchasing more than you require and choosing the best matching subset. But at what does the expense of purchasing extra, unused balls exceed the cost of purchasing a professional set in the first place? That is a question for you must answer for yourself.The balls are durable with initial stiffness loosing up with use."
1,Smaller than you think,These are smaller than those recommended by jugglers. These are golf ball sized. The juggler group I went to recommended balls that are tennis ball sized. I am disappointed.
4,"Good for the price, not great","I bought a few sets of these balls for practicing, and have mostly enjoyed them so far. They certainly serve the purpose for work with more than 3 balls, where I wasn't ready to buy a bigger set of more expensive ones.A couple of minor complaints:- The tags on them. They are annoying and are a pain to remove. Not clear no why they were even put there.- Lumpy & uneven. Most 4 panel balls aren't perfectly round, and these are no exceptions. They aren't quite 'squared off', but they certainly aren't perfect spheresThese quibbles aside, I don't regret the purchase at all. For the price, I don't think that these can be beat."
5,They ARE in fact.. Juggling Balls. Hard to get them wrong.,"They came a little stiff, but after playing around with them for a day I was pleased at how easy they were to handle. Although I don't do any fancy tricks, I am pretty rough with juggling balls. I do more than just juggle, including throwing them at friends in games or catch, or just throwing them against cushions to relieve stress.Due to these activities, I am noticing the stitching becoming a little stretched. I am a little concerned about it, but so far they are holding up mighty well. They don't cost much so if they do break it won't be much hassle to order another set."
4,Awesome Balls to juggle with!,"These are great juggling balls. I really wanted to learn how to juggle, but I never had any official juggling balls. Once I got them for my 13th birthday, and I swear I got better at juggling that day. These encourage kids to juggle, because they are so easy to learn from. The durability is pretty good, although the stitching wears out after about 2-3 months. But the beans are in a separate bag underneath the covering, so I have not really needed to worry. Also, the balls might be a little bit heavy for littler kids, so I suggest that you get some lighter ones to just start out. But otherwise, these are great juggling balls. The best (and technically only) juggling balls I got ever!"
2,"Random ball packages, sizes and weights!!!!! yuck!",I received multiple ball sizes and weights which is very inconvenient for beginner jugglers to use while learning. Two different types of balls were included with stickers added giving both types the same barcode!! Even the balls in the same packages that matched in size had different weights which makes them less desirable as a juggling set especially for beginners. Overall I was unimpressed and feel that this company failed to deliver what it had promised to deliver with it's description online.
3,Good balls with bad stitching.,"Received on a Friday. By the end of the weekend had threads pulling out, not just stitches loosening. I melted the loose thread down to the surface after pulling it tight, but the other half of the stitch it should have been part of is still completely loose to the point of being able to see inside the ball. Hopefully the opening won't get any wider.If you don't mind stitching that won't hold for any length of time under gentle use, the balls are actually very comfortable and confidence inspiring, due to ease of handling."
2,Loose and loud,"Not as tight and durable as I would have liked. Cheaply made and does not provide a firm, solid grip. If you have never juggled before these will work for learning, but otherwise I would stay away."
3,Laptop Bag,"It was advertised as ""leather"" but in fact was imitation. It is worth the price I paid because it is for a 17"" laptop and all the ones I checked out were in that price range. It's well made and plenty of storage so I am satisfied for the price I paid ($29.00)."
4,Nice!,Item rec'd in good time and the bag is excellent for the price. Not sure if it's100% leather but is close enough. Good deal.
2,No North?!?,"I am planning a driving trip from Lisbon through northern Portugal and Spain to Bilbao. I purchased this book looking for guidance. Well, there is absolutely NO information on any of these areas. Not a word on the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao (one of the greatest architectural achievements of the 20th Century).... Nothing on Santiago de Compostela a U.N. World Heritage Site and one of the most wonderful cities in Iberia.... Silence on the Basque homeland and the Rioja wine region. Any guide to Spain and Portugal should at least cover the basics of these places. What a disappointment."
1,Portugal and Spain are not the same,"I consider travel guides on of the most useful books. When someone likes to travel like me, it is an opportunity to experience deeply local issues thatb other wise would tend to be hidden from the first time around tourist.For this reason I totally disagree on the fact that the author tends to summarize Portugal and Spain, two of the oldest countries in Europe, therefore with totaly different aspects and much to say about, in one single book.On the educational side, it is misleading for most people does not know where Portugal is and considers it part of Spain. I hope the author could appreciate the completly different realities when in Portugal and in Spain.."
1,Broken Dreams Of Castles,"The same old thing - Spain is one thing,that includes Portugal, neither country deserves an entire book to itself. Can you imagine a book about Ireland and Iceland (well, there's only a letter between them),it's really a very tiny difference?Generalization apart, aren't you a little suspicious of people who are willing to be your special friend when they can oversell you their farmhouse so you can pretend you're buying into the REAL FRIENDSHIP with the pure Latin."
1,Not surprised these are discontinued . . .,"This is a perfect example of a well-designed serving tool that was badly made. The bowl of the spoon is generous, but not as deep as a ladle. The shorter handle makes it easy to use and control, espcecially when scooping up heavier casseroles from a baking dish. What a shame it was so cheaply made! In less than six months, without ever putting it in the dishwasher, I've found the handle to be cracking away from the bowl. Right now, it's just a couple of deep cracks in the handle, which makes it difficult to be sure the piece is clean, but it's obviously one or two uses away from breaking completely. Darn it, Farberware! With just a little more attention to quality control, you could have had a real hit on your hands."
5,most useful spoon in the kitchen,It really is. I wish I had bought 3 or 4 of these when I bought only 1.
2,wrong materials listed,This listing says the blanket is made from 85% acrylic/15% polyester. Which matched other blankets from northwest i have that are super plush. When I got the blanket from amazon the packaging shows 100% polyester and it is not as soft. False listing or advertising. Too bad I don't have time to return it since it is a Christmas gift.
1,Not happy with this text,"I was disappointed with the quality of this text. This book attempts to take a challenging subject and dummy it down into simple terms. What is left is an over- confusing non-accurate text. In two years, not one of my students has liked this book."
3,"Book is good, software ...","The book is a pretty good introduction to Statistics, but the software, ""Statdisk"", crashes all the time. I tried it under both Win98se and XP, and it crashes frequently. Though, it does work better under XP.I download an updated version of the software, still buggy. It might be a good idea to re-write this program for the next edition. (just don't hire Deitel and Deitel, then it would never work)."
1,Skip This One,"Claire is searching for answers as to why her beloved husband Keith would commit suicide, convinced he wouldn't do such a thing. Yet while she's investigating the death of the husband she loves/loved so much, she falls for Sheriff Nick in less than 3 weeks. No grieving widow I know would be swayed so quickly, which makes the plot unbelievable. The story is choppy & forced & the writer provides no real background for the characters, making it hard to cheer them on. Don't buy if you want to read - get it from the library."
2,typical drugstore read,"This book was pretty disappointing. Mrs. Harper had a tendency of repeating information pertaining to the characters in the novel almost word for word every few chapters. It felt as if she wanted to be sure that even the basest of readers would internalize certain facts and never forget them. In addition, while the book appears to be fictional, at the very end of the novel she begins to refer to the crisis of September 11th. This really detracted from the story. Instead of making the work become more alive by tieing it into modern day occurences she widened the gap between a badly writen novel and real life events. To all those considering reading this book it is highly probable that you will be able to locate a better read that at the end you wont feel like the hours you spent reading the book were a waste."
3,kept me guessing,"Good read the second I had read by this author Hiding place was first, it was more exciting but I liked this story and the twists a lot."
3,Brought DVD,"Although a wonderful film, I was very disappointed at the end of the film to be told Part II will be out later. The DVD tells only half the story.Buyer beware, the story is in two parts and this first DVD is only half the story of Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa.But well worth buying."
1,Shoe pocket runner wallet,It is suppose to be able to fit your drivers license into it. IT DOES NOT! You can not close the flap with the license in it and you would be lucky to fit a key into it.
5,Interesting Book,"I enjoy reading it a lot! It is a ""must read"" for any architectural student. It was shipped very quickly."
4,Not a genuine Honeywell item,"While this item did the job, and was a direct plug in; it is not a genuine Honeywell product. Item functioned fine and works the same as the item that it replaced."
2,Not Honeywell,"While it appears to be decently made it is an off-brand so I don't know how long it will last. Based on the listing, it makes it seem that you are getting the actual OEM part and you are not. This served to get me up and running but I have since ordered the real Honeywell part from an HVAC supplier to have on hand in case this one goes out. Good idea to have a spare anyway."
4,Not Honeywell Product,Unit fit as promised but it was not OEM manufacturer as advertised. Easy to follow and concise installation instructions were included
4,"Perfect replacement, just use your old clip",Connects right up. Just the mounting clip that comes will it is very soft metal. Very little spring tension. Used the clip from the original and all was fine.
3,NOT A HONEYWELL PRODUCT,"This item was sold as a Honeywell product, it is not. There is a slight difference which required additional work to make it work properly. THIS IS NOT A HONEYWELL AND AMAZON SHOULD CHANGE THE NAME AND DESCRIPTION."
1,Cheap aftermarket,Placed order because wanted OEM Honeywell brand (as advertised). Received a cheap generic aftermarket part which sells for 1/2 the price.
1,Never worked,brought it home and installed it went to race and an error came up each time we re-installed it same thing so...... i thought it was a waste.
1,Raven,"This is the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I say ""attempted"" because I was unable to finish it. The characters were one-diminsional, and spoke like children. There were also too many coincidences. No matter how bad something was that befell someone, it was all better in the morning. I did not care about anything that happened to Chance, Raven, or any one else, and I stopped trying halfway through the book. What a waste of time! I really don't think this book deserves any ""stars"" at all."
1,not worth a penny,"i love nora hess but i dont know what happen to her when she wrote this book!! it was long, and boring i wanted to punch raven in the face half way through the book dont let this one book of nora hess ruin it for u just pass this one up.."
2,Raven By Norah Hess,"I didn't like this book. It started off good and then it just died. I had to force myself to finish it. I am not a big fan of Norah Hess. I have read a couple of books by her, and I wasn,t impressed with her. Raven was my last book by a this auther. I won't be reading anything by her anytime soon."
4,Nice wooden clock,"This is a very nicely made clock. I love the real wood and the size especially.I thought this was going to be a little on the oval side as the photo appears to be, butit is perfectly round. I also like it because the second hand movement isn't loud."
5,Parametric EQ + extensive Bass control = best value,"I needed a parametric equalizer to tweak the Horn and Mid-Range amplifiers in my system. The PLE520p accomplished this with flying colors. Subsequently, I used the Sub-Woofer control section to fine-tune the Class D amp of my bass driver. This is one AMAZING piece of gear! High-quality, gold-plated, heavy-duty RCA Connectors on the rear panel are well labeled. Zero measurable distortion with miserly power-consumption.The Auxillary-Input feature, with its dedicated pushbutton, is perfect for connecting an iPod or Sirius/XM receiver. There are seperate Input-Gain adjustments for both the Line- and Auxillary-Inputs ... very professional.I will order a PLE720p next, to gain 2 more bands of parametric equalization, and review that unit after installation."
3,bookreader,"If you buy this to have access to Microsoft Reader and all the available books. This gadget has a fairly tough learning curve to download books. At least I had a hard time. I could not find the site I downloaded to although searched for 3 days off and on. Maybe I am not enough of a geek. Eventually I found a file, maybe not the perfect file as directions call, for but now can download any book I want. Easy to download from a CD disk purchased on line, with about a million books on it, I will never be able to read all the free available books. Any thing is available free if you search far enough. Larry"
1,Amazon sent me a bad one!,"I just now started to use POCKET PC H1935 I bought from Amazon. I TRIED to sync the IPAQ to my Toshiba Satellite laptop BUT FAILED. I spent the whole night trying to figure things out. Computer expert said it's bad. Then, a friend of mine who is also a computer expert tried to sync it with my laptop. He finally gave up and said, it's ALSO NO USE. THE THING IS THIS IPAQ IS BRAND NEW. MY RECOMMENDATION-YOU CAN GO TO AMAZON FOR PEOPLE'S REVIEW OF PRODUCTS. THEY TELL A LOT OF TRUTH. THIS IS LESSON LEARNED, CONSUMERS---BEWARE!"
3,Good but could have been better...,"I bought the HP Ipaq 1935 about 3 weeks ago. Here are some pros and cons to sum up:PROS:1) Very very light2) Very slim3) Great screen, great resolution4) East to set up5) Good included apps (word, email)CONS:1) I always have to soft reset to have my Socket SDIO low power modem registered and recognized by the PDA2) The touchscreen seems very very fragile3) Apps hang and you have to soft reset or go into the pda's equivalent of Windows' task manager and kill it (I never had this issue with Palm OS)Overall I have been happy with the PDA, but the need to soft reset often and the need to kill apps still alive in memory are definitely grating on my nerves. I still like it better than Palm OS devices b/c I had a Palm V for 3 years and the interface got a little boring to use. If I had more money I would buy a higher end Ipaq ($350+ range) so that it had more features built in and also would probably be more stable. If you can afford a more expensive Ipaq, go for it."
4,Ease of Entry,"Disclaimer first. This is the first pda I've owned. I've never had a palm product so I can't compare. But I can tell you I am VERY happy with this product. VERY thin and light-fits nicely in a shirt pocket and doesn't drag your shirt down. Nice, BRIGHT, sharp display. To me, data entry is critical. I find the transcriber-you just write your normal writing on the screen and it transcribes it into type--excellent for data entry. MUCH easier than poking a tiny keyboard one letter at a time. 4 stars instead of 5 for using an sd card slot instead of cf. Get some WriteShields to protect the screen."
1,Don't buy this IPAQ. The screen breaks for no reason,"Look at all the reviews here. You'll find out that a large precentage of them is saying ""good product, until the screen cracked for no reason"". Same here. One day I found the screen bleeding from the top left corner. This was about 4 months after I got it (90 days warranty, thank you very much). This IPAQ was hardly even used.Save yourself. Don't buy this product. Get a Palm (had one for 3 years before this Ipaq, never had an issue with it)."
3,"Great PDA, if it never leaves the house","The computer actually works pretty well, is easy to set up, and fast enough for all the applications we're likely to run on it (including a full-featured implementation of Go). It's also pretty comfortable to use. With the security problems of wi-fi and other wireless options, and limited appicability of BlueTooth, the more expensive versions didn't make a lot of sense. It's not for FPS gaming, but it works pretty well.Unfortunately, the glass touch screens are ridiculously fragile. Ours developed a crack across one corner of the screen after a couple of months of use, rendering it useless. Although there is no evidence that the unit was dropped (pressure fracture?), HP isn't even going to think about warranty coverage. Worse, they want about $15 less than the original price of the unit new in the box to replace the screen. I don't know how this compares to other PDA's, but this one is far, far too delicate to be a practical consumer item. Not recommended."
1,THe most horrible purchase you can ever make,"NEVER EVER buy an iPAQ. I bought one, and what do you know, just one month later, I pick it up and the screen is cracked. I treat this thing better than I would a baby, and I did not drop it or do anything at all to it. So I call HP, they tell me to send it in, and what happens? They want $200 to fix it. Well, I thought that was obviously a bunch of bull since I had just paid $300 for it. Apparantly all the 19xx line is like this. If you buy iPAQ, you are a fool. They don't give a crap about their customers, I am 17 with a temp job, how am I expected to come up with $200 to fix it, I spent gd long enought coming up with the $300."
5,"Finally, the Palm killer...","The HP iPAQ 1935 finally comes close to rivaling the sweet simplicity, smooth operation and convenient size of the Palm handhelds.I switched to Pocket PC after years of using Palms because I was tired of syncronization conflicts with my Palm and figured two Microsoft apps will sync much better than a Microsoft / Palm app. So far I was right...no difficulties in synchronization.This unit is smaller than the Palm V (but slightly heavier) and operates with ease. My only complaint is with the battery life but I guess you can expect bright, color screens to do that to a battery. Overall, thumbs-up on the new 1900-series HP iPAQs!"
2,YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN,"This product is wonderful when it works 5 Star. I was praising it to everyone and then what do you know 2 weeks after the 90 day warranty expired the unit stopped talking to my computer and then froze and stopped working. I had experienced much of the same that people have written about HP after the warranty expires. They don't care. I was told it was not good business practice to honor the product shortly after the warranty expires. It would cost too much. Cost too much??? I will now instead of praising the product and telling everyone that this is so much better than the Palm and they should look into an IPAQ to avoid IPAQ and HP at all costs because it will cost you in the end. Word of mouth is the best advertising a company could have and HP Strikes out. Either purchase an extended warranty, buy the unit on a credit card that doubles the warranty or STAY away from HP."
1,HORRIBLE,Not able to sync appts. and contacts with my computer. Only tasks made it to the desk top.Warranty expired and IPAQ went dead the next day. I guess it only had a 6 month warranty. :( Support not helpful as the people were very hard to understand and could not help as the warranty expired. Tried to find out minimum cost to send for repair and was sent to many different people and no help. BEWARE IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND IT PROBABLY WILL.
4,The Hewlett-Packard 1935,"I recently got an HP 1935. I was turned on by its cheap price, and since this is my first Pocket PC, I didn't want to invest in something more expensive. It's very little and light. Although it's not the fastes PDA on the market, I don't think there's really big difference since it takes not even a second for most things to load up. It lacks the Bluetooth which it has a Irda beaming thing. So you don't really need if you don't have anything else Bluetooth enabled.My only turnoff is the screen. Already there's two scrates. I treat the thing like a baby. So I don't know how they got there. I recommend this PDA. But just be VERY carefl with the screen."
4,Great wireless package,I purchased this package to go with my linovo cordless keyboard as it did not have a keypad. Installation was very fast and trouble free andgreat quality and performance. Worth much more.
4,good product,"Product works well. The only issue is that the mouse needs to be about one foot away to function properly. Otherwise, plug and play."
3,Why is this thing so massive?,"I just wanted something small and portable to use with my laptop. When I first received this item, I saw how massive the keypad was and decided to return it immediately. Logitech makes reliable and quality products (they have wonderful customer service, too) but if I wanted a keypad that was half the size of my laptop, then I would've just gotten a full keyboard."
1,Not useful at all,"I received the item very quickly, but when I installed it, I became very un-happy with the product. First, there was a lot of ""extra"" software included on the installation disc that I did not want. The mouse caused the cursor to jump all over the screen and flutter, the number pad is useless for Excel. It only enters numbers and has no navigation options. The paste to clipboard did not work. The calculator was VERY VERY basic. Not at all what I needed or expected."
1,Bigger than my laptop,"I chose this item for the convenience of the shared usb devise. Unfortunately I did not check the dimensions and when it arrived the calculator was thicker and longer than my lap top computer and half as wide. I am not sure why it is necessary for this device to be so large, certainly the technology doesn't require it and I am making the assumption that anyone computer savvy enough to want this piece of equipment would have already acclimated to working on a smaller keypad. Unfortunately I was out of town when it arrived and the 14 day return window has expired so I am now stuck with this monstrosity."
3,The mouse is alright but..,"I mean it still seems worth it for the price. I would have rather of spent more money and got a better mouse, considering I will probably almost never use the numeric pad; due to the fact its just too cumbersome. It would be best in a home office type setting, its more of a stationary item."
4,A magic album with a Magic Woman,"Tania Libertad offers this new production ""costa Negra"" the first made in europe, a review of tanias' black-blood, with sound from africa and her great voice and interpretative power, the unusual bass-colour in the voice and the felling ""negro"", Tania recover old song's for renew it in fantastics version, Historia de un Amor, duet with the legendary Cesaria Evora, it's now a new clasic in the large trayectory of this peruan-mexican singer"
2,Ok...,Ive been using this for the last year and have had problems with it twice. Ive had to take it apart and clean out the contacts so that it would conduct once again. For reference I have used electric fans for about 5 years and havent had a problem with a thermostat until now.
2,Lasted six months,"Still looks like new, it was easy to install, and it worked nicely for a while, but it's pretty pricey to have to change it at six months. I didn't find any other similar switch to purchase, so I'll have to pry it open and see if cleaning the contacts will fix it, as another reviewer described. I had it set to the lowest setting, so it probably turned on pretty often, but still, there are lots of cheap relays which run for years without the contacts getting dirty."
5,Excellent,"I've been thru several older ""classic"" books on screenwriting, and while each was helpful, they were the same old... stuff: formatting, characters and so on. Each seemed like a re-wording of the other.OTOH, Kristina's book is straight from the gut, and is recent enough to tell it like it is. The fundamental stuff is all there, as well as up to date information. Her help was invaluable to me, a beginning screenwriter. I didn't want Syd Fields all over again, and this book delivers. Highly recommended!"
5,This book can make it happen!,"Christina Hamlett's Could It Be A Movie? is by far the best book available on the subject of screenwriting. The clever, well designed cover sets the tone for this easy to follow yet all inclusive journey from idea to screen. The author guides you through the process with specific rules and suggestions that will give your script the best chance to make it to the top of a very large pile of submissions. The book is well organized and easily referenced yet offers many personal and humorous highlights. It is not often that you will find laugh out loud moments in a ""how to"" book. Ms. Hamlett is energizing and her passion for excellence is contagious. After reading her book I couldn't wait to get back to writing after a long slump and have finished my screenplay. If you have an idea and want to get it ""out of your head and up on the screen"" as the subtitle states, get your hands on Could It Be A Movie? Your story just might be the next box office hit!"
2,Better Than Nothing,"I found this songbook to be most unimpressive as far as faithful recreations of the songs and only worthwhile to get if there's no alternative. Not only are the arrangements not true to the original harmonies, but whole verses and introductions are left out, and the keys are drastically changed (sosmetimes as much as a fourth lower), which gives the wrong impressions as to the how the song should sound, and the type of voice suited to the song. According to the keys in this songbook, the role of Sarah Brown was sung by an alto when in reality it's a soprano role. Also, I question the leaving out of ""Marry the Man Today"", one of the best songs in the show. The photos of the different productions at the beginning of the book are nice, but they don't make up for its musical shortcomings."
1,Looking for Guys and Dolls? Not here!,"This is, by far, the worst vocal selections I've ever bought! And I've bought a lot of bad ones! I was in this show two years ago and had a fantastic time(I played Nicely-Nicely)! So I didn't hesitate to order the music, but when it arrived I found the selections chopped beyond recognition! And not only are they chopped, but they're also simplified! This book should be marked ""Easy Piano!"" If you're looking for a good rendition of this music, spend the extra $20 and buy the score!"
4,It just happens,"No one can tell what the normal human sexual relations are. We are in a so wierd world where anything might happen. Now people are more tolerant than they were 20 years ago.We have gays, transexual people and many other forms of human sexual or nonsexual behaviors which are recognized by the main stream of the culture.Who knows what the future will hold? Perhaps we may go back to the premitive stage of human life where incest was highly approved of."
3,A moderately entertaining story.,"This film is about a man who becomes a detective to commit crimes and uses people in order to achieve his dastardly aims, he becomes a partner in crime with some smugglers he is supposed to investigate which results in several deaths, a felloww investigator eventually catches on which leads to it's expected conclusion. a somewhat entertainig film with a good cast which includes Ramon Gay, Gloria Marin and Carlos Lopez Moctezuma but the formulaic story is a bit of a letdown but it is entertaining enough to be reccomended."
5,The music will stay in your head,"It took me awhile to get into this book because the first section consisted of interviews with classical artists and those from the opera. Sadly my musical knowledge in those areas is lacking.Once I reached the musicians I was familiar with, the book was a gift! Songs played in my head as they were mentioned and their synthesis described. Many of the artists have since passed away, so it was wonderful to remember them and learn more about them in their own words. The ones that really resonated with me were interviews with Alan Lomax,Pete Seeger,Bob Dylan, Mahalia Jackson, Ravi Shankar, Lil Armstrong, and Leonard Bernstein.Studs Terkel was a master at allowing people the space to speak their mind and lay out who they are and what is important to them. His interviews form a legacy that is gift to us all."
5,Songs to fall in love with,"After listening to this CD, I found myself daydreaming as though I was in the front row at his concert, and he was singing directly to me. The songs on this CD are wonderfully uplifting and his voice goes right to the heart. The only thing I can say is these are songs to fall in love with."
3,"come on Joe, you can do better","sorry this just didn't do it for me. Joe come on it's time to stop doing covers of other's songs. Alvin Lee's, One of These Days & sorry Joe didn't measure up. Again covering Bad Company, Seagull?, it's just ok. Than are you at a point that you need to cover a song you've done before Around the Bend? or did you forget that you did that on another cd. Joe take the time to write some blues songs & come back. You need more than just cut a cd & show up. I admire what you wrote on the cover sheet but you didn't deliver the goods."
2,Let me down,"I originally heard the title song on the radio.This was the firsttime I had heard anything from Joe.I don't know if it was just myframe of mind at the time or what but the song really grabbed my attentionso I purchased the cd. After giving it a listen I have to say that I don'treally care for it.I can appreciate Joe's guitar talent.It seems that hehas learned from many of the greats.I heard licks that seemed they were from Eric Clapton,Peter Frampton,Steven Stills,Jeff Beck,Jimi Hendrix to Jimmy Page which is okay.What I didn't like was that everything about the album seemed contrived and over-produced. None of thesongs really appealed to me.Even the previously mentioned Sloe Gin didn'thit me the way it did the first time I heard it.I have heard that Joe really knows the Blues route so I will give him the benefit of the doubt.Its just that this album left me cold.Sorry Joe!Anyone want a slightly used cd?"
2,I've heard better,"I think Blues Deluxe was his best CD.The live CD from Fort Wayne Indiana was also good. In my opinion this was just O.K. I saw him live in Teaneck, N.J. this kid is an awesome player. He's capable of great things, I don't think this CD reflects his talent."
3,Blooze Rock CD,"I'm a HUGE Joe Bonamassa fan, but this second CD with his new band continues the new tradition of over-produced electric blues. Fortunately there is more accoustic material on this CD than on ""You & Me"" to offset what I would call ""blooze"" which is almost muzak to my ears. The production is flawless, don't get me wrong - it just loses a lot of the raw, spontaneous feel that blues is known for. It is too slick. Bonamassa is a killer player, but for a first CD I would suggest ""So, This is How it Works"" or ""New Day Yesterday (Live)"" The latter is also available as DVD and is a killer concert. If you get a chance to see Bonamassa live, do not miss it. I rate him a 6 hour performer - that is how far I'll drive each way to hear him play."
2,Bonamassa morphs into Mayer,"unfortunately for those of us who loved Joe's hard-drivin blues, the John Mayer business model has hijacked this record. schmaltzy love songs, with that syrupy over-emoting that sets my teeth to grinding and my legs to sprinting to the next-track key. but the next track ain't no better. this is a hole album of this. i can see Joe's demographic plummeting into teeny-bopper girl territory, or empty-headed metrosexuals tapping their feet on the 1 and 3. i liked tea for 2, but at least that tune had a killer payoff solo. say it ain't so, Joe."
3,Not up to par on this one,"Joe is definitely the guitar player of today, but I must admit I like his previous work a whole lot better. I can only pick one song on this CD that really stands out. On his other CD's it is hard to pick a favorite because it was all so good. I don't like to put CD's down I almost always try to stay positive, but I must admit I was disapointed with this CD. Good but not #1 stuff."
3,Evident musical growth but disappointing release,"I am the biggest Bonamassa fan in Ohio but I am not a blind fan, meaning I will speak with honesty. While this release shows incredible talent and complex musical growth, it is a disappointing purchase. Naturally, I will continue to purchase his releases and go to his concerts but, JOE, you have strayed from the path. Get back to your original 3-pc and let 'er rip! I respect your direction and musicality but I think this path you are on explains why you have not hit on a larger audience. You have the talent, voice and artistry to do better."
5,Sloe Gin,"I have never bothered to write a review before however, I must defend this great collection of songs and disagree with the other reviews of this CD. I realize it is not a true heavy blues sound that we have come to expect from Joe , but that is not what it was intended to be. Don't expect a musical genius like Bonamassa to stay in the little box that people tend to place musicians in. This CD gets my vote as #1 over anything else released in 2007."
4,Best effort so far,"I love this album. But one thing I would like to say: first time I heard him singing, I thought was Paul Rodgers."
3,Not Joes Best Effort,"I'm a big fan having all the previous recordings but this one leaves me a bit flat. This CD has it's moments but some of the songs sound like previous efforts and I still buy JB albums for one thing, to hear the guy play the **** out of a guitar. IMHO that aspect is way too understated and Joes stuff hasn't been the same without Kenny & Eric pushing him."
5,"The greatest guitarist in the world, hands down.",I don't see how anyone can say anything bad about Bonamassa unless they simply don't appreciate his genre of music. He is the greatest guitarist alive and he is only in his mid 30's. He was the opening act for BB King when he was only 12 yrs old. This is another great CD from a musical genius. What more could you ask for?
3,The first (at least somewhat) disappointing Joe B Album...,"OK, Joe was on a roll from the start in 2001..alas, it has ended. Every album heretofore provided a new twist, better songs, better playing, whatever. This album falls short on all accounts, unfortunately. It's still good--hey, it's Joe B! There's gonna be quality, no doubt. But on this album he's just too restrained--boring at times. His tone is KILLER. That's the best aspect of the music on this CD. But he can do so much better! And like some of his other fans, I wish he would do more straight-ahead blues and play his heart out. And what's with the duplicate recording of ""Around The Bend""???? He already recorded that song on one of his earlier albums, and it was fine. Why re-record it? I thought this CD was a little heavy on cover tunes, but one of his own, too? Come on, Joe! He's taking it easy on this CD...well, OK, Joe, enjoy your little breather. Now get back into the studio and really let it rip next time!!!"
3,Great blues rock,Joe is a great guitarist and refining his good song writing. This is a good album for people who like musicians music.
3,"Not Bad, but doesn't rise up!.","It's not bad, but I was Expecting more from Joe B, I know it was supposed to be a Acoustic Album until Joe got into the Studio with Kevin Shirley and added some Electic Guitar to it, but it never Takes off, it's a little to mellow, however it sounds great!. I like the Bad Company cover ""Seagull', but did he have to redue his own song ""Around the Bend"" again?. If your just getting into Joe there are better starting points then this!. The one point where Joe B has improved here it's in his Voice, it's never sounded better. I don't want to be to Critical of Him because we need guys like him keeping the Blues alive, I'm about to see my first Bonamassa show."
5,Open the Eyes of My Heart,"Open the Eyes of My Heart is my favorite of the collection.This is an awesome inspirational song that inspires hope, faith and love. I loved this song. I like all of the songs on the CD's."
4,Beautiful,"I'm not Christian, and never was growing up; however I find these CDs beautiful! A wonderful buy, even if it's not your religion. Very much recommended!"
5,"Well-researched, valuable biography","Joel Oppenheimer was an important, influential Beat poet, and Mr. Gilmore has rescued him and his era. Readers who remember Oppenheimer will be happy to meet him again. For my part, I was glad to be introduced to a great personality in American letters and to the generous sampling of his poetry that appears herein. A model biography, in its meticulousness and its objectivity that is always tempered with affection."
1,It will CERTAINLY arrive broken.,"I know that the review is about the product and not about the service. However, as there is only one vendor selling this item on Amazon (at least when I bought it), in this case I am going to say something regarding the packing quality. I opened the package in front of the UPS carrier and it was completely broken, so I didn't accept the shipment and he took it back with him.It is a pity because the item is beautiful but this seller doesn't have common sense about how to pack fragile objects. Packing was so poor and communication is not easy either because I am still waiting for a response to see if I am going to be refunded.I have read other costumers reviews and they also had the same problem. Then I think that if after so many disappointed costumers this seller still doesn't take care in the packing process it really doesn't worth it to try again, because it will certainly arrive broken again."
4,Color off,I thought by the picture that this was green with pink dots. It is actually green with cream dots. Feels like it might break easily. Over all it is cute and serves the purpose.
4,Good scooter for the price,"This was one of the items on my 11 year old's Christmas list. I don't really know a lot about scooters, but it was listed as one of the top toys in Sports Illustrated for Kids, so of course he had to have one. It was very resonably priced, I got it for less than half the retail on Black Friday, and was very easy to assemble. He loves it, the first thing he did after getting it was take it out and ride it for an hour. We have had it for a week, but it appears to be sturdy and well made. If it holds up to him, it will hold up to anyone!"
4,Great Scooter For our Four Year Old,"Our four year old was really wanted a skateboard for Christmas, but we didn't feel comfortable with getting that for him as we thought that he was still too young. He's had a three wheel scooter for a couple years and has mastered that pretty well. So, we bought this scooter for him as it was a hybrid of a scooter and a skateboard. He loves it and wasn't disappointed in the fact that he didn't get a skateboard. At first, we thought that he might be too young based on other reviews, but he was like a fish to water on it the very first time. For the money, the quality is top notch. We would definitely recommend this scooter."
1,Emergency room waiting to happen,"Do NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT use this scooter in a city such as NYC where the sidewalks are uneven. It is hazardous and we had a bloody mess on our hands and 3 stiches in the inner lip as well as facial lacerations and blood everywhere. The Razor is much safer and this Fuzion is AWFUL.Mother of a 6 year old"
4,Son Loves It,My son (8) got this for Christmas and he loves it. It was easy to put together and it is lightweight yet sturdy. Great for a beginner or someone who is a little advanced because it can do tricks. I definately recommend for a 6-10 year old. The weight limit is 175 pounds but I don't see a real big kid liking this.
5,excellent,"This is an excellent purchase. My son is 6 years old and having the four wheels was a safety thing for me. I have watched other kids with their ""Razors"" with 2 wheels and my son can do a lot more tricks with this scooter than the 2-wheel ones."
5,Daughter loves it!,We got this for our 7 year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it & unfortunately so does every other kid that came over for Christmas :)She's able to have good control & go slow or as fast as she likes. She doesn't need any help & is really enjoying it. Great for younger kids. We had the 2 wheel scooter before for our older son & this one seems better made.
4,Fuzion,"My 10 year old loves it. Well made, light weight, and handle bars fold down so youcan take it anywhere."
4,Fun and functional,"This is not only a fun scooter, but well designed as well. The real test is do all the other kids in the neighborhood want to play with my son's toys? In the case of the fusion, the answer is a resounding ""yes""!"
4,Preferred another,"My kids already had two wheel Razor scooters. There isn't a problem with this scooter, but they prefer their old scooters. They also received a Powerwing when they received this one and they prefer it as well."
3,do not buy for younger children,this scooter i had bought for myself because of the trick capability of it but it sort of failed because it is over 3x heavier than a razor scooter and i broke my wrist trying to hop off of a picnic table so... it is also very dangerous.it is not designed for street but skateparks. there are no brakes on this scooter whatsoever and my foot hits the wheel as i petal again this is a dangerous scooter and i do not recommend it to anyone under 15 years old
3,Comparison with Razor Scooter,"My 12-year old son, who's ridden a Razor scooter since he was four, wanted the Fuzion for Hanukah. While it's a decent scooter, he's been disappointed at how clunky and slow it is, relative to his Razor. With four wheels rather than two, and a correspondingly wider wheel base, it takes some getting used to, as one tends to hit the rear wheels when one kicks to propel it, generally falling in the process. It's probably a nice scooter for someone starting out, or someone who's mainly interested in skateboard type tricks, but it's not a great scooter for flat-out speed or transportation. I wouldn't advise it for someone who's ridden a Razor or other two-wheeled scooter previously."
5,Superman Muscle Costume,"Great costume! You won't be disappointed getting the ""muscle"" version (versus just the plain costume) we had many, many laughs and great pictures with our 2 year old in this. Highly recommend!"
5,Definately worth a listen,"A coworker handed me this CD. His musical tastes usually don't mesh with my own, but this CD is so good, I doubt anyone could dislike it. Filled with innovative sounds from unusual instruments, Empire State still manages to compose some of the most lovely, melodic tunes I've heard in a while. Everyone should check this one out."
1,This book is quite rediculous,"The ""Claude Glass"" sounds like a very interesting topic, but the handling of this topic by the author A. Maillet is out of the limits of professional academic research. The very short chapters filled with heterogeneous thesis and arbitrary pictures and diagrams evade a clear art-historian or philosophical approach of the Claude Glasse's use for artists in the 18th century. The first interesting thesis, that you expect normally in the introduction, is presented on page 163 (of 221 pages main-Text): ""The Claude Mirror... is... an apparatus that enables one to transpose reality into a melodious harmony."" In the internet you find articles that give you more insight for free."
1,Don't Believe the Advertised Delivery Date,"First, I must say that this is one great saw. I would not hesitate to recommend the saw to a DIYer or professional. The problem I had is with the promised delivery schedule. When I purchased this, AMAZON was promising 5 day delivery (we routinely receive items from AMAZON within 3 to 5 days). A few days after purchase, I was notified that this would be a 12 day delivery: this item is bulky/heavy, and is apparently shipped freight rather than routine UPS/FEDEX etc. If you need this item on a specific schedule, beware."
3,Great Book!!!!,"I acuttally don't own yhis book, I borowed it from a library. It's a very,very fun book. In the end there trapped in a sinking ship (just like in The Hidden Harbor Mystery.) I think Danger on Vampire trale is much funner. This book is about people who are trying to steal Micro Eye's secret device,the bad guys have a secret hideout in an old tomb. I recommend this book for mystery lovers!"
3,CAUTION: Chinese Racial Stereotypes!,"This review is for the Applewood 1930's text reprint. This story is probably not for the young, it should be read with the understanding that it was written in the 1930's. It is a decent mystery, but if you are offended by Charlie Chan movies you will want to read the revised re-written version from Grosset & Dunlap."
3,[my] Opinion,This is the first Hardy Boys book that I ever read. It was very enjoyable to read. Some parts of the book are more exciting than others. Like when they Hardy Boys went to South America to look for a spy.I would recommend this book to kids my age and older that likes adventure and mystery.This book was good enough to make me want to check out the rest of the series.
2,Not Much Better Than The Original,"This review concerns the revised 1965 edition. Frank and Joe help the U.S. government foil a plot by a small South American island dictatorship to steal a top-secret spy camera. Anybody who read the summary to this book would think that the book was going to be really good, but; unfortunately, the summary was probably the most exciting part of the book. The plot sounds good on paper; however, I thought that the book lacked action and excitement and many of the events that sounded so good in the summary do not end up to be much at all. The revised edition is better than the original, which was a complete snore, but it isn't a good book either."
3,None,"The original published in 1933 was the last of the great originals as I define them. The book focused heavily on the title which I liked and presented a fairly good mystery although the ending was not that great (last Chapter). Overall however this was not a bad book, The plot flowed along nicely throughout the early chapters and there were some fairly humerous parts to the book. The Revision I never liked. Much too modern.Orginal: Rated B Revision: Rated C-"
3,good story of juvenile delinquent,sal mineo is first rate as a troubled youth released from reform school being guided by therapist brian keith. Dino has difficulty adjusting to life after reform school with the pressures on him from his family and the threat of his younger brother joining a gang and going the same wrong path as he did. film is much more interesting than good will hunting.
1,Fell apart during first use!,The first time I used these one of the snaps that hold the gel pad on fell off. There are 8 snaps on each pad and most of them unsnap after a few minutes of use. I would not recommend these to anyone! I'll go back to my old pair of pads.
5,huge senna fan,I have been using senna caps and tea for over a year. I am very happy with it. And will continue to use them both.
2,Works better in combination with psyilium.,Senna by itself is not nearly as effective as it is in combination with psyillium.
4,it works:-),"it is better than the products like this found in drugstores, because it seems to have a higher content of Senna."
5,What words can be said?,"When I received this book in the mail - my honey bought it for me knowing I am a die hard fan, I cried! I sat down and prepared to spend a night with my Marilyn - and rightly so, as it took all night! The foreward to the book was so enlightening and funny and really made me feel as if I was there. And the pics - I can't even think of words to describe them! It is somewhat sad to know that these pics were taken so close to the time of her death, but it shows Marilyn at her best. There is just a raw sensuality and sexuality that made Marilyn the sex icon that she is. And it is all here in this book. This is the ultimate book and it my very prized possession!"
2,Not Worth The Money (except for 3 pictures),"I was terribly disappointed about the content of this book! In my opinion, only 3 photos were what I would consider to be ""stunning"", which were semi-nude (very tasteful) photos of Marilyn in bed. One, in particular, where she was photographed sleeping peacefully, was especially touching. That one photograph seems to capture the exhaustion that Marilyn was dealing with prior to her death. The rest of the photos were not worth a dime - too unimpressive! My advice: try to find this book at your local public library and view it before you decide to buy it."
2,"Hang on, not soooo great","I have to admit I was very excited to receive that ""Last Sitting"", and then extremely disappointed when it came. Yes its big, yes there are lots and lots of photographs, most of which are completely new to me, but the printing quality is epically horrible. Dismal color reproduction, seriously over sharpened, B & W's are filthy, registration seems off, high level of pixilation. Not at all what I would expect for this kind of money. As a reference book its likely a must have as a coffee table book of stunning images give it a pass."
4,Amazing book,"The book is very well made with great quality paper. There is a little introduction by Bert Stern at the beginning and then all the pictures of the last sitting in chronological order. You can see big images, the ones that Stern thought were the good ones, and then the little ones which are very interesting and funny too. It's an incredible book, you can see a new Marilyn, more mature and prettier on the inside and on the outside."
3,Great bike except,"This bike works as advertised, I was easily able to switch over my standard kickstand from my old bike. My only problem was right out of the box the highest gear slipped. I have tinkered with the derauler for two days and have been unable to fix it."
2,No kick stand,This bike is what my man wanted for christmas in 07 and i got it and would you believe it didn't come with a kick stand; so now i have to take it to a bike shop and have them to put one on it. You would think for the money i paid for this bike it would automatic come with a kick stand but i guess i thought wrong on this one.
3,not for the young or restless,"this is not childs' play. at least not for children under 10. this is a great but tough game. figure approx 2 hours. I'm an adult and I needed to take a break. my biggest complain is the packaging. the puzzle only fits back in the box if it is completed. needless to say, it has been left out a few times."
2,Another Swiss Watch failed me again,"After my first wenger watch got water in it, I decided to purchase this watch. I am outdside a lot and needed something that I can wear in water with little maintenance. The first thing that went wrong was the dial popped off, the green part that is around the clock was just glued on. I was fine with that as long as I knew the time. Then the unthinkable happened, it got water in it ! Now it no longer works! This product is faulty because the screw will occasionally losen by itself (the one on the side you use to set the time) which allows water to come right in."
1,Buyer Beware,This book is hopelessly out of date. Copyright 2006Information is 90% useless.If you by a self-publishing book that was published more that two years ago you are going to get a lot of wrong information.This book has tons of it.
3,Helpful to beginners,"Self-publishing can be more economical in the initial out-lay, but marketing is a challenging. This book can provide some of the need-to-know information for beginners."
5,Power outage no worries,Installed Basepump in April 2010. It took about 4 hours most of which was consumed by running copper pipe to unit. I just had the first power outage recently and it performed just as advertised. I am very happy that I can be away from home without worrying about my newly remodeled basement having water in it. I have recommended this product to friends and family.
5,A great but disturbing tale,"This is one of the best books I have read on the Vietnam war. Well written. If I could get the rights, I would turn it into a film. Well worth the read. Find it if you can."
3,Very Resourceful,"This book gave me alot of insight on things I hadn't really thought about, like the ""business"" side of things. Great ideas on how to get your clown show organized. Lots of good ideas for show routines. It also was full of resources. Great book! However, I wouldn't say it would be for the beginner. it was a little more advanced than i expected."
5,Just what i wanted,This was a replacement for a previous one i had. exactly what i wanted can be used as a backpack
5,Glorious Playing! Virtuoso In All Respects,"I would agree with most of the editorial review by Edith Eisler. However, I think she implies some subtle criticisms that border on the snide and that I disagree with. She talks about the shallowness of the repertoire on this recording. I think there is an art to playing flashy pieces that are normally reserved for encores in a way that gives them substance. Of course, there is nothing wrong with just enjoying them for what they are. Regardless, I find Znaider's playing of them to be near perfection. It goes without saying that his technique is as close to flawless as it can be. His tone gorgeous and his interpretation is superb.It doesn't hurt that he is playing on one of the greatest violins still around from the golden age of the Cremona violin makers. On this recording he plays on the famous Kreisler Guarnerius Del Gesu violin made in 1747.So what's not to love on this recording? In my opinion, nothing!"
4,Good resource for braided tack,"I purchased this with the interest of making miniature western horse tack, specifically braided pieces, and it gives instructions on how to do all the basic braiding (6-12 string around a core), and several knots used in braided tack (ring, turk's head, pineapple, cowboy, gaucho, etc.). If you are new to braiding, you may want to refer to other sources as well for help (I also purchased Woolery's book), because there is a bit of a learning curve to this, but I did use this book's instructions to make my first pineapple knot. It also shows how to construct a hackamore, including tying of the mecate and hackamore and fiador knots.There is a section on making saddles, but it's a rather brief overview and isn't of much use if you are actually planning on making a saddle (even a miniature one).Overall, it's a great reference book for your library on western braided tack, and I'd definitely recommend it."
2,No beginners,"This book is only for those that are already skilled in braiding leather, not for the novice or beginner."
3,cowboy horse gear,for the more experienced leather worker to make some very fine horse gear.includes a lot of examples.
3,"Interesting Book, A Little Hard to Follow","A very interesting book on how to make rawhide horse tack, with an informative section on saddle making, which is why I purchased it. Provides a great background and history, but I found it difficult to follow to directions on exactly how to make the items included. However, it does provide a great background on how these items are made, and some traditional methods to use. Overall, I am glad I purchased it, it does provide a lot of information!"
4,Good but technical,"This is a great book, but be prepared to take a fair amount of time out to learn the tons of information in it. Told by experts, this book should be considered by those who have some experience in leather and braiding."
3,good.. but needs making better,This game is quite good...but the idea of having 1 moving weapon is dull...and there are only coulors! no pattens!
1,You can't be Serious?!!!!,"This book is woefully and inadequately researched. Here, again, there are those who want to continue to make a buck off the backs of slaves some 141 years later. The good news is that some of us know the truth and reject this as merely an Internet driven collaboration of conjecture. It is nauseating to suggest that Harriet's own account of her life can't be taken as fact. It's typical of these same people to accept, without question, the life recollections of Robert E. Lee or any of the other so-called ""great American heroes"". Typical yet not surprising. You should stick with subject matter that won't prove you wrong at the end of the day."
5,Voted Best Non Fiction 2005,An excellent book! You will learn so much more than you ever thought you knew about Harriet and what you did learn in school doesn't hold a candle to who she really is. This is a remarkable book and should be part of every middle school history class. Larson has done an excellent job bringing this much information to us and years of research do it. Remarkable!
2,very disappointed,"While the book is useful on a superficial level, the presentation is weak, and the first-person narrtive offered by the screenwriters sounds edited and forced. Much of the material offered here sounds gleened from published interviews, rather than directly from ""the horse's mouth."" As a chronic collector of books on, by, and for screewriters, I was very disappointed, both in the quality of the book (cheaply produced; poor quality paper, blurred printing) and by the lack of insight promised. There are many better books out there!"
2,It's ok but too much too soon,As an avid surfer my first thought was this scooter would help my twins develop their multi-axis balance skills. It is true that this scooter WILL ride in a way that would develop a good understanding of hip and chest weight shifting and center of gravity control however there are some drawbacks.The drawbacks are simple. Don't expect your 3.5-5 year old to suddenly haul off and ride this scooter. It's hard for them. In fact in tests I ran with two kids (twin - fraternal with different physical ability and balance skills) niether really has fun with it and can ride a RAZOR better than this scooter. Now understand a RAZOR is a two wheel scooter and this has 3 wheels. What happened here? Perhaps they suffered so much on this scooter that the razor seemed easy.
1,It can break your child's wrist.,My 3.5 year old son doesn't like it at all. He tried a couple time but it keeps moving his wrist.
4,Mediocre Tales,"The tales in this wonder-box are readable and appropriate for children, although they are also somewhat heavy-handed with their morals.Table of Contents is clickable, though greyed out on the menu and there are several properly-linked foot notes. The illustrations are absent, but their captions are still in the text (but very obviously so, and thus easy to ignore).Contains the following stories:The Ouphe of the WoodThe Fairy Who Judged Her NeighborsThe Prince's DreamThe Water-LilyA Lost Wand"
3,Don't buy this if you own Season 1!!,"This is the first half of the Season One episodes, while The Early Cases - Vol 2 is the second half. So if you own the Complete Season 1 box set, you don't need to buy this. Hope this is helpful. Someone shared this for volume 2, and saved me some money, so I thought I'd share the love."
5,Haunting experimental folk,This album is incredibly haunting and still sounds fresh 20 years later. I suspect the people that don't get it are just not spiritually in tune with the atmosphere that is created by this beauty. A must for any fan of apocalyptic folk worth his or her salt.
2,Only marginally interesting,"This is a project of Ian Read, who has performed with occult-oriented, gothic-experimental groups like Current 93 and Death in June. Fire + Ice just doesn't cut it. The only two releases I've heard are _Gilded by the Sun_ and _Midwinter Fires_. The latter of these appears to be out of print. _Gilded by the Sun_ is the better of the two, but basically this is just lightweight New Age music with occultist lyrics, with little of the dark gothic sound of groups like Current 93. I'd pass on this one unless you're a World Serpent Distribution completist."
1,Not good!,"This is NOT a valid representation of English Ballads or Folk Songs. The songs are repetitive and the vocals are flat, week, and uncompelling. The playing is fair at best. Used copies are being sold for over $40--time for me to sell my copy on E-Bay. I like ambient mellow spaced out gothic material--but this is just week. If you're thinking of getting this for another version of ""Long Lankin""--run away now and seek out Steeleye Span's ""Commoner's Crown"" for a MUCH better take on the ballad."
2,come on now,"I read the whole thing. There are gaps in the storyline. Huge chunks of time pass and you have to figure this out. AND the lead woman character is PERFECT. Perfect looking, speaking, every action is perfect. She doesn't make any mistakes- she is not human! The guy is great- at least he shows some humanity. Save your money, save your time for better books. This was a dud."
2,"Sweetheart, Indiana","It's not Gary, Indiana, but it is the long lost home sweet home of the Charles family. Now that she's been left the estate, it's the town Gillian Charles owns, or will if she lives there six months. Rolling with the punches, she agrees to the terms of the will, moving into the executor's, Sam Law, house while he housesits for his parents. It's love at first sight, for her and his dog; maybe for the two humans as well. It's already assumed that they are in love, can reality be far behind? However, there is a sinister foe lurking, waiting for their chance to end all of Gillian's hopes if she gets in the way.** There's a bit of everything in this novel; sensuality, humor, and suspense, but with so much, the overall effect shortchanges each aspect. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"
5,Watch out John Mayer and Dave Matthews,WOW! This CD is great--something you want to listen to over and over! This guy is going to be big! Watch out John Mayer and Dave Matthews!
5,Lots of fun and exercise too!,"We played this ""our"" way. We seperated into two teams: one parent with each child (ages 7 & 3), and raced all over the house collecting things. First one to collect the items (we did only about 10 items per game), won the round. The kids had a blast, and mom and dad got lots of exercise. We all had a lot of fun with this and the kids wanted to play over and over again. You can play according to the game or set up your own ""rules"". It is a lot of fun for all."
2,Fine - Would not read the rest,"This book was ok, if not a little predictable. I would not read another one from the series. However, it is somewhat cute and light, and if you are looking to finish a cute book in a couple of days, this one is OK."
3,Engaging and light,"If you are a fan of the Madeline Bean series you will enjoy this. Annabelle Archer is a wedding planner in Washington, D.C. She has a couple of quirky sidekicks and the possibility of romance with a handsome police detective. She's also plagued with a lovable and slightly annoying busybody of a neighbor. All the characters are fun and even though the story itself was somewhat predicatable, it is entertaining and highly readable. I am looking forward to the next installment."
4,A Delightful Debut,"It's always a pleasure to find a new author whose work I enjoy and Laura Durham definitely fits the bill in this case. From the beginning where the mother of bride meets her untimely end to the revelation of the killer at the end, the writing was tight, clever and enjoyable. Annabelle Archer has her own share of troubles even before the murder and finding her friend (and caterer) Richard as a suspect does not help.If you're looking for a pleasant way to spend a few hours of light reading, this is definitely a good choice."
5,Outstanding!,"An impressive first novel, which kept me highly entertained throughout the book. As a former client of Ms. Durham, she is as creative in her writing as she is in her wedding coordination. I expected amazing results and she delivered. It is a witty, funny read, which gives us a glimpse into the crazy life of wedding planners. I am expecting more great stories from Ms. Durham and look forward to her next Annabelle Archer Mystery. Nice job Laura!"
1,"Leslie Sansone, Walk Off Weight System - Firm Off Weight","This video was poor enough to motivate me to warn other users about its content. The video does not include warm ups, cool downs, stretching of any kind or complete instruction regarding the correct form to be used during the exercise. In fact, during some segments such as the outer thigh workout in Segment #3, the improper form is demonstrated. The range of exercises is minimal. Even if all three segments are completed, exercises for the back, calves and quadriceps are missing. There are too many good videos to waste time or money on this one."
4,"easy for you, Leslie","easy to follow ... some of her comments, like ""now that's not so hard"", would be better left unsaid. I have several other dvds and they are all helpful"
3,Promising effort!,"After I read it, my most strong feeling was that I would have liked to know more, not about what happened after the book ended, but little things along the ""quest"". That's probably because I'm an avid Stephen King fan, and I'm not used to books that have a rushed feeling, lol!Anyway, it has a lot of promise, and some powerful, and scary, images, and I recommened it to every friend of horror stories. I personally wait for his next shot in the genre, with hopefully more relaxed pacing. Good show, anyhow!"
2,Kindle,If your going to use this on kindle don't! Book looks like it's been photocopied. Photos are very dark.Not for kindle at all. Very disappointed
4,VERY SMALL BUT HANDY,WHEN IT FIRST CAME IT WASN'T AS BIG AS I THOUGHT. BUT ULTRA PORTABLE AND QUITE A NICE LITTLE GIFT TO GIVE OR TO GET
2,Mini is right!,"Cute, but when they say its a little book, they ain't kidding! Nearly too small to even read! Book was perhaps 2"" x 2""."
5,Wonderful,"Excellent book, great condition with the most wonderful photographs - a must buy if you want to see how Ireland looks"
2,Not very Kindle-Worthy,"This concerns the Kindle version. Figured I would purchase this given its low price, to see how it might look to have a picture book on the Kindle. Well, the book did not render well. The photos were quite dark. A few were tilted oddly and did not fit the screen fully. The text, which is supposed to be minimalist, loses that quality on the Kindle (Kindle sort of designed for rolling content, not artistic text presentation).Awaiting a definitive Ansel Adams Kindle collection !!"
2,Fun book. Not good for learning the game,"I bought the book hoping to learn squash, being a beginner. I was disappointed to find that it wasn't written for that purpose. It has nuggets of wisdom from one of the greats, so I suspect it could be more interesting for an advanced player of for a squash aficionado, but not for someone looking to learn the game from the ground up."
4,Microsoft Streets and Trips[2007],"This is the second generation of this software I have owned. It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map."
3,it's an okay split,"I'm not a huge fan of these 2 bands but since theyre swedish crust/hardcore, I had to have it on my collection."
5,High quality for good price,"These are very nice looking pulls, I added to a white bureau and the contrast is beautiful. Very sturdy and comfortable to use."
4,Great pulls,"These are great pulls, and go very well with the Amerock rubbed bronze pulls I purchased. High quality that should last for years. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that other pulls I've purchased in the past have had paper a grid inclosed that you can tape to the back of the door so you'll know where to drill the holes for the screws. These didn't have that grid, but it wasn't a problem to make my own, I just used the clear plastic from a page protector, but one more step I could have avioded if a guide had been enclosed."
3,Amerock Drawer Pull,"I would buy these pulls again, but from a different source.The pulls were what i expected, except for one thing. The finish on several of them were marred by the included screws. The packaging was such that the screws could, and did, come in contact with the pulls during shipping. The nice smooth finish on several pulls had visible thread marks."
1,Ho-hum,"Post-Modern posturing and hocus pocus masquerading as mysticism and eschatology. Larkin is the closest thing to an interesting character this book presents, and its pacing makes frozen molasses seem to run like quicksilver. No need to mention plot inconsistencies and outright gaffes by the author. The editor should be shot."
4,Worth it,You can see marilyns home.Also has good interviews and gives you better understanding of last day.
5,The pulchritude of Eleanor Parker,"Eleanor Parker is just as beautiful as Monroe, but her breasts are smaller.Watch Parker act up a storm in ""Interrupted Melody"", playing the polio-stricken opera diva Marjorie Lawrence."
2,"Good news, bad news","Jane Monheit has a lovely voice, reminds me of early Maureen McGovern. That's the good news.The bad news is everything else. The songs she chose for this live CD are uninteresting and over-performed by practically everyone else. Worse, Monheit and her back-up arrangements have no tempo, no intention, and no gut feelings invested in them. It's the aural equivalent of watching paint dry. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is so stretched out, you could do a load of laundry and your grocery shopping, come back, and she'd still be singing it. Monheit also feels the need to talk between every single number, before she launches into her boring rendition of it.I asked for this CD for Christmas, based on the 4 1/2 star rating it recieved on Amazon.Don't believe everthing you read!!!"
3,"Talentosa, pero insuficiente","Jane Monheit es indiscutiblemente, una joven y talentosa cantante. Tengo sus anteriores cds y al escuchar este ""EN VIVO"" me parece que no logro obtener lo acogedor de sus anteriores trabajos, pese a que su calidad interpretativa esta al mas alto nivel (por algo ha colaborado con musicos como Blanchard y O'Connor, por citar algunos)No obstante lo anterior, el aporte de esta grabacion es reunir en un solo cd, los ""standard"" mas destacados de sus anteriores trabajos.Recomendable para quienes empiezan a escuchar a Jane Monheit, para el resto, me inclino por sus trabajos anteriores."
5,Economical,"I like to add smoke flavoring to many things, especially home fried potatoes. Finding dry smoke flavor is impossible I guess, so I started using the smoke flavor pepper. This version is much more economical than what I was finding in the grocery store."
2,Nothing Special,It was a very weak smoked pepper and was not worth buying. I recommend McCormick smokehouse pepper instead. I was very disappointed
2,no msg = no flavor,"The old version of this product had MSG, and perhaps other differences as well. In any case, this is reminiscent of that old product, while tasting totally flat and more or less worthless. I'd rather use plain salt.I miss MSG."
2,"Watch out for the miligram strength, if your system is sensitive!","I went to the ""Amazon Contingent"" to try to find Selenium, as I couldn't find it in the local pharmacy. I certainly found it, and promptly ordered it, and didn't keep track of one thing: when you take selenium you need to make sure that the dosage level is something that your body can tolerate. Yes, it's supposed to help in circumstances of Hashimoto's. BUT, keep track of how you feel when you take it. In this case I needed a supplement about a 1/3 of this strength."
3,"Fine, but product picture shows sublingual, these are not, nor are they flavored","Of course, any tablet ""can"" be sublingual, but there are more fillers and inert materials used in a regular tablet versus a sublingual one, and are usually smaller too. Although I haven't noticed a difference since taking them, I'm sure the product is fine... source naturals are usually pretty decent formulations.I'm giving this product an ""average"" review instead of a ""bad"" one, since the text doesn't actually say sublingual, but from reviewing the text and photo together before ordering, I expected it to be as shown in the photo (it's pretty clear), so obviously you aren't getting the product in the photo, and I believe it should be changed right away."
4,First scooter,"This is a first scooter, for the younger ones as the front wheels are wide set and the handles do ot let them turn to sudden they learn the basic's. Our Grand Daughter was 2 and now 6 and used it a lot. She's now proficient on the type with just two wheels and we feel she was safwr learning on the Radio Flyer Model."
2,stable but stiff,This scooter doesn't turn. My son never rides it. It is stable enough for a younger rider but way to hard to turn which makes it no fun.
2,Poor Turning Radius,This scooter does not turn. The turning radius for the front wheels can not get the rider around the corners.
2,Kinda boring.,"My two year old loves the idea of the scooter but gets frustrated with its poor turning abilities. The whole contraption is very stiff. Safe yes, great foot base, pretty slow wheels, but he is always riding into the curb because he can't even remotely veer away by turning the handle-bar. I wouldn't recommend and am surprised by the high ratings on this one."
2,A waste of money!,"I got this for my son (who is 2+ yrs.) because I thought he was still to young for the Razor scooter (I was wrong). He doesn't like this scooter at all, he does 3 steps on it and he wants me to carry it. It's hard for him to keep pushing and pushing, unlike the Razor it's much easier. Very disappointing and waste of money."
4,Can't Fairly Review This Until...,"It's hard for me to review this product until I try the other scooter that so many parents talk about called the Micro Mini Scooter. The Radio Flyer seems sturdy and safe -- the one important exception being that I have twice clipped my finger folding up the scooter. My son is 2 1/4 and the height of a 4 year old. He can push it, but it is hard for him to steer straight at this point. We live in a big city and the bumpy streets are a difficult too. The height of the handle is good for my son, but I have to bend over to pull my son on the scooter, which is often how we use it. Overall, we're having fun with it and I am glad I have it -- but I am curious to know if the micro mini is better. I'd love to read a review by someone who has tried both."
1,mistake,"It was a present for my granddaughter. I'm far away, but my daughter said it is flimsy, hard to ride, and generally unsatisfactory. Picked the wrong kind."
5,1st red scooter,"There was nothing to assemble, which I did not expect; made Christmas eve easier on us. Have not gotten the child on it yet, but will soon and I know he will love it."
3,so far so good,"it's ok... but little bit difficult to fold it.............it is ok, but little bit difficult to fold it. ?"
3,Not what I expected for a Radio Flyer,It is ok. Not very sturdy and it easily tilts over.To many plastic parts. I would look for a better quality scooter.
5,My 2 year old LOVES this scooter,I bought this for my son who just turned 2. He had been obsessed with his sister's Disney pink scooter that he never could really get going on. This is great for his age - it is really wide so he can balance fairly easily and can just take off and go!
3,not the best,I just got this scooter for my two year old boy. I was not that impressed with it. It is really cute and being a radio flyer I thought that it would be really great. It is really hard to turn the front wheels. He is really good on my daughters scooter that has the one wheel in the front and two in the back. He doesn't do as well on this one like I said it is hard for him to turn it. One feature that I do like is that you can fold it up.
2,Handle bar is stiff,"Honestly, my boys will ride it for a block (they are now 4), and then will be done with it. It's just too stiff. They try to turn the handles and the wheels won't turn more than an inch left or right. I think the reason is that the part are all plastic. I like that they fold up, but that's about it. I wish I would have bought one with two wheels and one in the front! I have seen that style made without all plastic and I think it would ride better. They are pretty slow. With that being said, my 2 year old can ride it by himself and likes it for a minute or two. But a boy that wants a real ride, I would look for something else."
2,Can't turn easily and tips over easily,"This was given to our 1 year old son for Christmas because his 4 year old brother has a Radio Flyer scooter with one wheel in the front and two in the back and our younger son loved standing on it and being pushed around. I'm not sure why this is a good ""first scooter"" because this thing tips so easily, even when it's not moving! My son will stand on it and just turn the wheels a little and it starts to tip. Plus, because the two wheels are in the front, it only makes super wide turns. We feel our older son's scooter is much more stable and fun even for a younger child than this. If we would have purchased it ourselves, we would have returned it."
3,Hmmmm,I bought this for my 2.5 year old son. He was very happy to see it and had some fun with it. BUT it has VERY limited turning capacity. Its cute but I see him loosing interest fast since he isn't really able to steer!
4,"For very tall two year olds, but best for threes","Grandma bought this for both my daughter and my niece last Christmas. My niece is TALL (my brother is 6'5), and she had a blast with hers in the summer, at age 2.5. My daughter, on the other hand, is a shorty (not gonna point any fingers on that one), so she was mostly in danger of giving herself a shiner as she desperately tried to ride the scooter. I let her fiddle with it on dirt paths so she couldn't get any speed. She will finally be ready to have fun with it this spring, I hope, at age 3.5. And yes, helmets -- it's stable but it CAN be flipped over, especially on smooth surfaces. No adults or older kids, of course, because the deck IS plastic, no matter how strong. I did appreciate the click-lock fold down, but it is a bit hard to release."
2,unstable size,"If you are just looking for a cheap scooter, then by all means go ahead and buy. But be warned that it is not a very stable design (steering in front with no skateboard like sway). Even if you put an adult's brain into a 3 y.o., this scooter would not be fun because of its instability (again, design is the issue)."
5,Excellent scooter!!,Grandson thoroughly enjoys the well made and durable scooter. Would recommend it as a purchase. Very sturdy and easy to use.
2,tips too easily,"I bought this scooter for my 3 year old who already rides his big sisters old scooter. Although he can ride the other scooter with 3 wheels well (I purchased a new one so he didn't need to keep riding a girl color), the base of this radio flyer item is too wide and tips very easily. Child has to make sure their foot is exactly in the middle. I would not recommend this particular item."
3,"Safe, Durable, but not speedy","My son received this as a gift for his second birthday and learned to ride it very quickly. The base is wide and very sturdy with the three wheels so I feel comfortable with him riding it. However, he can't get it going very fast, and there is no gliding on it at all. You have to constantly push off with your feet to keep moving. If you push off and stand like the older kids do on their scooters, it will stop almost immediately. Overall, it's fun and safe, but at 3 years old now, he's ready for the next step in scooters."
2,Radio Flyer looks good less fun,This product looked promising. My daughter is currently using a fantastic scooter that was a handmedown and it is ready to die. G-ma bought this for easter for her and my daughter will not use. She can't steer without the feeling of tipping over. The front wheel look sturdy but don't provide the balance needed for a 5 year old to keep it up. I had other children try it as well and each one abandoned it for a different scooter. Looks good less fun.
2,Not at all what we were hoping for.,"We received this scooter as a gift from my twin 2.5-year-old's wishlist. We have a number of other RF toys and really looked forward to using it. Unfortunately this thing is a dud. It's very difficult steer and is not nearly as smooth as smooth as other 3 wheel designs mentioned. The steering problem occurs because the weight of the child's front foot is right up by the front wheels, and the design does not allow the child to lean to control the direction at all. The width of the platform may make this scooter more stable, but it also hinders control during turns. I see that Amazon is now blowing these out for nearly 50% off - probably still not worth it. The Mini Kick is a much better design and I highly recommend purchasing one of those models instead."
2,does not steer,"My son, who was two years old at the time, was very happy when he saw the scooter and he was up on it trying to scoot around right away.However, this scooter does not turn around well what is frustrating and sometimes dangerous since the child cannot move away from obstacles or turn on sidewalk /street corners.It was easy for my son to balance his weight on it because of the large base; nonetheless because of its limitation he rarely uses it. If my husband had not trashed the box I would have returned it.I got him a Mini Kick Scooter and this one is so much better, it really steers well the only con is the base that is thin for a first time scooter."
1,Horrible,This scooter is horrible. It does not steer at all. My 21/2 year old can't steer it. If she moves her foot slightly it falls over and is dangerous. I tried pushing her and steering so that she could get the hang of it and I couldn't even steer it. The engineering that went into the design of this scooter is joke. They have a nerve to sell this crap!
4,"Overall, a good first scooter","This scooter is nearly ready to ride right out of the box. The double wheels in the front allow my child to glide along without bumping into an extra wheel (we also have a scooter with the double wheels in the rear and the extra rear wheel tends to get in the way). Overall, this scooter seems to be well constructed and we are hoping to get a few years worth of use from it."
3,Awkward for use,"The scooter is cute, and folds well. I wanted to like it so much.But it sits, barely used. The two wheels at the front make it really cumbersome to move. My son is a tall 2 1/2 year old and I don't think he will figure out the cause and effect of turning the handles on this one. By the time he's old enough to figure it out, he'll probably be ready for a two wheeled scooter.All the way around, that was a big disappointment (as I had visions of him riding around happily on it). I still gave it 3 stars because it's durable, folds well, and is very stable. Perhaps another child will have better luck with it, but it's a stinker around here."
4,Bought as a gift. You can't beat affordable.,"My friend's boy was having his 2nd birthday. I asked what was on his wish list, she said scooter. I found this one on Amazon, and fell in love with the price!!! It's worth the cost, not to mention free shipping! The only negative, that I could find, is the wheels are hard plastic, not like the ""jelly"" wheels on a rollerblade for example. You can find scooters with the ""jelly"" wheels on Amazon as well, but... those were out of my budget. I did feel like a bad auntie, so I asked my friend if her boy enjoyed his scooter, and she said YES, they can't tell at that age if it's cool, jelly, smooth, whatever! It's enough for her boy to have a great time with, and that made me happy."
2,Not a good first scooter for a small child,I bought this scooter for my two year old based on the reviews. She is very petite and really struggled with the weight and bulk of this scooter. Now she is almost four and still petite and she still struggles with it. When she borrows her friends' micro mini scooter she scoots much better.
2,Durable but Only Fun for Riding in Straight Lines,We have had this scooter for about two years. It withstands everything - very tough scooter. But the turn radius on the wheels is so small that my kids can't make a U-Turn in our two car width driveway. It often tips when my son tries to turn even at a moderate speed.
5,Perfect for a Preschooler!,"Super sturdy and cute scooter that is a perfect size for my 4 year old boy. Does not tip over, and has a wide place for him to stand. He loves zooming around on it."
2,Breaks easily!,"Radio Flyer My First ScooterWe had this for about a month and had a hard time at first figuring out how to fold the scooter. After several efforts, the bar with handles started to loosen and would bend forward slightly when our 2 yr. old tried to push himself on it, making it pretty unstable.Next he overturned it, stood on the bar and managed to break off one plastic handle bar completely! This product is cheap plastic and I wish we had bought him one that actually used metal. We ended up tossing the whole thing because we could never glue the handle on right again, and with the bar not secure to the board, it made it a hazardous trap. Stick with metal scooters, especially for first time users!"
2,Cumbersome - Difficult to steer - buying something else,"We regret this purchase. The steering is so stiff that it is difficult for even a very strong 2 year old to turn, so he can not really steer it and establish learning that concept. So we are looking for something else. Our five year old has a hard time turning it as well. It is sturdy, but too stiff."
1,Fell Apart 1st Use Injuring Toddler,"We love Radio Flyer (Licensed) Products in general and were really surprised this one was such a complete dud - the first time our LO tried it the wheel fell off and he fell getting a bloody knee.To make matters worse, this wasn't just an assembly problem we could fix to make the product usable - it broke. Shoddy and disappointing. Skip it."
5,A great first scooter for 2 yo and up,"We bought this scooter for my son when he was about 2. He kept trying to ride our neighbor's big boy scooter (the ones with two wheels) and of course he wasn't getting anywhere with it. So I did some research and decided on this way. We love it! Because of the two wheels in front, he has no issues balancing on it. It's sturdy and my son feels confident on it. He loves to try to keep up with the big boys next door with this scooter. He's now 2.5 and 36"" and the scooter is still going strong. We've had a couple kids test it out (beyond the 50 lb weight limit) with no issues. At this height our son can still ride the scooter comfortably yet there is still room for growth since the handle bars are still slightly too tall (but not uncomfortably). I highly recommend this as a first scooter and very happy with my purchase."
2,Does not makes corners well,"I really liked the concept of this scooter, and I would've rated it a 5 stars except for one thing.... It has very little maneuvering capabilities. My 3 year old can barely turn it, as much as he likes it. The extra-larger size of the foot pad is comforting for my not so coordinated little guy, but again, all you can really do is go straight! Needless to say, I took it back and got him a Razor(tm) product."
3,All plastic!,"My 5-year-old son just got a Razor scooter for his graduation from Kindergarten and my 3-year-old desperately wants one to be just like his older brother. This Radio Flyer is very cute but I am disappointed that unlike his older brother's metal Razor scooter, this one is all plastic! The front wheels are also pretty cumbersome to allow for fast turning and speed. Lastly, the T-bar is not adjustable and seems to be too tall for my average-size 36 pound 3-year-old.It's a good first scooter with the large platform (be careful to tell your kids to step on the white Radio Flyer logo on the platform to avoid any tipping) and the 3 stable wheels. However, the lack of speed and large turning radius may become frustrating once a child learns how to use the scooter and wants to go faster."
3,Stable but limited,"I got this for my daughter when she was 25 months old because she seemed very interested in scooters and I love Radio Flyer products. She is now 27 months old and still doesn't use it much. I'm not sure if it is a gender issue or the scooter is simply not as much fun. It is stable and durable but the front wheels turn only a few degrees. It can be frustrating for a toddler to try to turn a vehicle and fail, or get stuck in a corner. It is easier to ride than a tricyle in the beginning, but now that SBA is strong enough to pedal, she seems more interested in the tricycle."
3,poor quality...all plastic,My 3 yr old son got this for his birthday. he does really enjoy using it however I feel like it was made poorly. the entire thing is plastic....even the wheels which should be rubber. I think it is fine for the money however I do not think it will last as long as other radio flyer items I have purchased. I am really surprised they constructed this toy so cheaply. the fold up feature is nice and I think the wide platform is great for young riders.
3,Nanasbebes,Purchased for my grandson (3 yr. old.) It is very sturdy and he has had a good time with it. The steering is too stiff and pretty much goes in a straight line. ItRadio Flyer My 1st Scooter Redweathers very well.
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in this scooter. It is too bulky up at the front, and both my 4-year old and 2-year old sons have trouble steering it. They have no trouble with their friends' mini-Razors (which have narrower fronts). I would not recommend this scooter."
3,steering not the best,"The steering with this scooter was hard for my daughter to get. It was a smooth ride when she was using it. It lasted though some beatings, but getting run over by a car killed the back wheel so not sure if it would gotten easier to steer if she got older, she was 3 years old. It was easy to fold away when not in use."
5,excellent 1st scooter,"my son, 2 years old, got this scooter for easter gift. his older brother, 5 years old, got a razor for his b-day last year, but we were hesitant to get it out with the little guy around- he always wants what his brother has. so when i saw this 1st scooter, it was perfect! they can now scoot together without the baby getting hurt cause he can't yet work those big guy scooters. we love it! tough too- he's a bit rough and tough with his outdoor toys, and it has stood up, well built."
4,Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Crystal,"Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Crystal is a true 24% lead content crystal that offers the consumer the opportunity to own an attractive crystal at a sensible price. We feel comfortable actually USING this product, whereas we would be anxious using a $50-per-goblet crystal item from the big-name companies."
5,A Life Saver,"We don't know if it is effective yet with learning Spanish, but this tape is the only thing that will calm my 10 month old daughter. We just traveled for 16 hours straight and for some reason, this tape helps to place her in an amiable mood. The songs are sung in both English and Spanish, switching between verses and sometimes between words. They are very catchy tunes and not annoying like some other children's songs we have had to listen to repeatedly. We own both the Spanish tapes, I and II as well as the two German tapes. We would recommend the Spanish tapes to anyone who would like their kids to be familiar with another language, as long as it is supplemented by other learning methods. The German tapes are another matter; they are sung out of key and not at all melodic. They will become annoying the second time you hear them and anyone with kids could tell you, you'll be listening to them more times than you would like to count."
3,"Works, but not great","I have a Sony DSC-H5, and this lens isn't very good for it. It's compatible with the 58mm adapter ring that comes with the lens, but because of the adapter that the H-5 itself uses, you don't get a true spherical fish eye view through the lens. It cuts off a bit at the top and bottom. This is eliminated if you zoom in, however, but then you don't have the spherical image any more. You're almost better off just using a wide angle lens and converting it to a fish eye effect in Photoshop.The adjustable light hood on the end of the lens is also one of the most useless and pointless features I've come across. It may as well not even be on there."
3,Cheap and not as described!,"My 6 yr old was so excited to receive this spy case, only to be disappointed. First the fingerprint dector pen was white not black, which not sure if you realise it is almost impossible to get a fingerprint using the white rather than the black that the product said it came with. Second the lighted magnifing glass only worked for about 2 weeks I replaced the batteries, but that didn;t get it to work again. My daughter was very careful, and put everything back in its case and one by one the items stopped working (or didnt work from the beginning) or are broken now. Save your money!!"
4,Great Toy,"This is a great toy for the young detective. Its not your average cheap throw away cheap toy, it is really made well and should last a little while. The carrying case is a definite plus and holds all of the pieces together nicely."
4,Riding on the Wind,"Author Beresford reminds me of Ted Kooser in the way he often brings his world of reflections alighting from his British heritage, just as Kooser does his Nebraska heritage.You cannot read these wonderful haiku without being moved at the same time as participating in emotions and feelings he captures that are experienced by us all. One wouldn't have to be told he is a hang glider becasue many of these short bursts of reflection makes our own heart soar.Not only a good read, but good reflections from the read."
2,too churchy,"OK but too much emphasis on churcy religious stuff. Would not recommend it, was hoping it would be better. Word."
2,Old time message but in old-time style.,Did this book with small group. Did not enjoy it. Some of our members however did enjoy it.I guess a slow story about Mr. Rogers is what I should have expected since it was after all about Mr Rogers!
5,A powerful tribute to a wonderful neighbor!,"Amy Hollingsworth does a superb job of sharing not only the incredible impact that Mister Rogers had in her life, but in the lives of countless people of all ages. It was so refreshing to read behind the scenes stories that reveal the same wonderfully warm and caring character of Mister Rogers that was broadcast daily into the homes of millions. I personally have very fond memories of watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood nearly everyday as a child. As a psychologist, I know how powerful the principles and values shared and lived out by Mister Rogers are and am very pleased that they are so thoughtfully and eloquently remembered in this exellent book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who truly desires to learn, or be reminded of, some of life's most important truths."
5,A shining example of how to live the Gospel.,If you read nothing else this summer. Please read this book. This book has moved me and inspired me and is the most awesome example of one Christian man living out a truly Christ-like example no matter where he was or who was watching.
5,The Simple Faith of Mr. Rogers,Even reading the book has a calming effect just like his TV program. It was a very relaxing and inspiring book to read.
1,Very Disapointing,"Not worth $70 :( Poorly shot, parts missed due to equipment faliure that he mentiones in comentary. If this guy is a ""Veteran news cameraman"" you think he'd know his equipment, when watching a video we don't want excuess like that, especially when were paying $70!!! I'd only recommend buying this if you find it cheap. Oh and they are DVD-R discs :("
3,"Decent gameplay, but quite buggy","Overall, this is a good, but not excellent game. First the pros:Excellent overall gameplay - the character progression is well done, and you end up with some very powerful characters by the end.High replayability - with the ability to select different party members for each mission, and to allocate your level advance points differently with each game, no two games are every entirely the same.Now the cons:Buggy: The game stalls frequently, and I have recently found that I cannot progress beyond a certain point in the game because it locks up every time that a mutant uses an ""eXtreme"" power. This wouldn't be so bad except that the CPU uses those powers from time to time, and the game's up once they do.Poorly planned mission checkpoints: Sometimes you will find yourself replaying the same mission over and over again.Overall, this is a good game, marred by bugs."
3,"Like Diablo 2, only not very good",I honestly tried to make myself like this game but in the end it proved futile. The only part of this game that makes it even remotely appealing is the fact that all our favorite X-Men are in it. If your idea of fun is a lot of repetitive mindless button mashing then this just might be the game for you.
4,X-Men Legends,"First, I would like to say that this game cannot be played on an Xbox 360. I didn't realize that until I had already bought it. So if anyone does not have their old original Xbox do not buy this game.This game is a ton of fun though. I love a good co-op video game to share with my brother, friends, and my wife. It is something we can bond over and have a good time playing. When I originally played this game with my little brother we had a great time with this game and spent many hours playing through it on co-op. I recommend this game to anyone who has an Xbox and enjoys co-op games. This one keeps everyone having a good time all the way through."
3,Awesome for multiple people; not as much fun by yourself,"Me and three other friends spent about four late nights playing this game. We had a blast. You get too choose from pretty much all your favourite X-Men. I enjoy going smashy, smashy so I chose Rogue at first and later Colossus after we unlocked him.With four people there was the usuall map problems with people getting stuck and I'm famous for going the wrong way, but despite these expexted flaws the game was great."
5,Great Game! I recommened this game!,"This is a fantastic game! The graphics are comic-book like and the story is amazing. If you are a X-Men fan you should really get this game. You can explore the mansion, throw bad guys off buildings, and trip giant robots. It is a fun game and it really gets you stuck on it. The peoples powers are amazing- Use storm to throw bad guys in a tornado! There are many ways to kill guys like cornering them and beating them, zapping them, freezing them, punching them, and throwing themI highly recommend this game!!!!"
4,"Gotta Go Faster, Faster....","My son collects Sonic the Hedgehog books, so this was a great addition to his library. It's a Golden Book, which means it's technically for younger kids, but anyone who is a fan of Sonic will enjoy it."
2,Este Fuege - Falls Flat,"I recently got this CD from a friend and after listening to it I was disappointed to discover that there are only about two or three tracks worth repeating. Peralta's voice leaves much to be desired, however the instrumental tracks are nice due to the collaboration of some great artists. If you are looking for a true Latin favorite, try Los Lobos or even The Gypsy Kings."
5,Get into the groove,"Watch out, this puppy is one serious implement of havoc that will flatten the most recalcitrant hunk of meat with a few well-placed blows. It's got heft, it swings, but never too much because it's got a rubber grid on the handle to help you hold on even if your hands are wet. There are two heads, one large, one small for different degrees of tenderizing.I've turned substantial medallions of pork into cutlets in a matter of seconds with this item, and the result is meltingly tender and delicious. And, let's face it, something like this is considerably better than whacking at a tough cut of meat with a heavy plate, isn't it?And when you're not cooking, it makes a nice mini battle hammer for SCA events. That's Ms. Thor to you, fella."
5,This book was very helpful to me,"The authors of this book have put together many good suggestions to assist women in putting together simple, meaningful altars that could help them meditate, think deeply, or simply enjoy daily life. I like the photographs and the fact that the altars are created from common, everyday items that most women, whether in urban areas or rural, could easily find. I also like the fact that suggestions are given for constructing altars both inside the home and outside in all kinds of natural places. The book has given me many ideas for creating meditation centers, and I enjoy just leafing through the pages and looking at the pictures. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to meditate, comtemplate, or just plain sit quietly and think."
3,When you need help getting from the beach to the boat...,"This was the first book on sailing I read before I could get to the copy of ""Basic Keelboat"" my instructors had given me. I had bought it because it seemed to fill in those mysteries that hung above my beginner's mind like a cloud, such as how one docks or gasses up the motor. I remember being annoyed at the time that the authors laid on the sailing lingo without defining terms on the same page; but now that I've returned to re-read it after reading a few other books in between, I see that it does what I had originally intended: it just shouldn't be viewed as a book of instruction, which it isn't beginner-friendly enough to do. Beyond that, it serves nicely as a bridge from land to the ideal waters where the technique books work..."
5,Excellent Drum! Great sound,"Excellent drum for any little drummer in your life. My son has the entire series of drums, this one has a great low sound. Comes with mallets and makes a variety of sounds based on where you hit it. We love this drum along with the large gathering drum. :)"
5,A necessary telling of a subject often overlooked,"Kramer's book spreads light on a problem that is often overlooked in Japan. It seems to be divided into 2 sections: the first describing his experience as someone unfamiliar with Japan as he becomes acquainted with the new culture and the second, building up to the murder and exposing some of the darkness behind the glittering reputation of the Japanese education. Far more detailed and thought-provoking than Memoires of a Geisha, it is both an excellent guide for anyone attempting to grapple with living ina foreign culture and an excellent picture of Japan. I really enjoyed it."
2,Goodtimes Video Savages a Beautifully Animated Tale,"If the people of Goodtimes Video Distribution didn't destroy this awesomely animated series with their ghastly editing, this version of Wind of the Willows easily earns 5 stars. A lot of the original British production has been shabbily cut to make 3 ""complete cartoons."" Inexplicably two of these mangled vignettes actually repeat Toad's car stealing & escape. There is no reason for this bungling. It would have been so much easier just to package & distribute the John Coates/Dave Unwin series in it's original format. This beautiful animated version of Wind of the Willows deserves a better distributor. For shame, Goodtimes!"
1,Disappointing,"While the book itself might be ""gentle"" and ""charming,"" we found the video, while colorful, to be rather violent. There is more than one scene where characters achieve their aims using guns and swords as weapons against others. Toad crashes car after car without consequence . . . after all, he's always got the money to buy another. What lesson does that teach youthful viewers? Toad does eventually land in a dungeon, in shackles, at the hands of a rather menacing constabulary and with no trial. But he escapes to crash yet more cars. Our children will not see this video, nor - in good conscience - could we pass it along or sell it. Too violent."
2,poor reception,"We've had this phone for a year and haven't been happy with it. It cuts in and out, and the reception is poor at times - echo-y. The ""wall mount"" is ridiculous."
2,Poor reception,This phone is not good. It constantly drops phone calls in the middle of conversations. The reception is not great either.
1,Drops calls constantly,"This is the second Panasonic cordless phone that I have owned. the first one crashed and burned at 10 months and I had a terrible time getting Panasonic to even discuss the problems. I waited several years before buying another Panasonic, and this phone has been worse than the first. The phone simply goes dead within a minute or two of answering or dialing. I have tried replacing the battery, but that made no difference. Quite honestly, I will never buy another Panasonic phone. I feel like a chump for having wasted my money a second time; there's no way I'd do it a third time."
5,Required Reading is a Blessing,"I was required to read this book for St. Louis University's summer reading. I was upset because I don't really like chemistry, but I really enjoyed the history and humanity of this book. Reading it was a blessing in disguise! What a fascinating read."
5,"Owned it, read it, loved it, gifted it.","I already owned this book and read it a while ago. My freshman chemistry professor struck me as the perfect person to enjoy this book, and I bought a copy as a gift. I would recommend this book to anyone with a interest in science, history, or a very interesting read."
5,Great diagrams. Very informative and educational!,"I disagree with the reviewer that states there are too many diagrams in this book. Anyone with the slightest science background will be fascinated and enlightened by the diagrams and pictures which go a long towards explaining the authors' points.A good diagram is much more interesting and effective than 5+ pages of ""prose"". Yuck. The authors have it right and the reviewer is just wrong."
1,wouldn't load,I honestly don't know how the game plays since I couldn't get it to load on any of my computers. Don't know if it was because it ws used or not???
3,A TaxPayer's Servey of the Grace Commission Report,"Americans want their leaders to act against government waste and huge federal budget deficits. Thanks to the 47-volume report produced by the private sector Grace Commission, we now have a way to do it.The Commission's humane practical reommendations to cut waste and make government more efficient could save us $424 billion in just three years.This book is a layman's survey of the Grace Commission ReportIt condenses the Commission's proposals and tells how government excesses are costing you billions of dollars.What's more, A Taxpayer's Survey shows how you can help beat the deficit by getting Congress to enact the Grace recommendations into law."
5,Any tank needs this,"Before buying this I would have to sweep the gravel all the time, this stuff eats the food up and I don't have to sweeep the gravel so no more replanting plactic plants and more other decs around to get under them. So far I'm happy"
1,Buyer Beware: Not the item pictured!!!,"Don't be fooled, this is not the Episode II Obi-Wan Lightsaber in the picture. I'm not sure what exactly they are selling but the picture and the description are different."
5,Me Likey,This thing is awesome I mean it looks and feels so real tha if you gave me a couple of glo-sticks to attach I could send some body running for the hills.:p
5,Yay!,"I guess this will be the last season to come out on dvd since they didn't make it through the eighth season :( But I love the show, and I'll buy every season they put out. One of the best & funniest sitcoms ever. Not just best BLACK sitcom, but best, period. No need for that ever-present label. Btw, I've gotten the last 4 seasons or so at deepdiscountdvd. It's cheaper, free shipping like Amazon, AND most of the time it arrives on the day of the release or before, if u can believe that. Personal experience. I don't work for them or anything lol. Super free shipping thru Amazon is great, but last time I ordered a season, they didn't ship it til 3 days after it was out!! Not knocking Amazon, but I'd definitely wanna know that info if I was a buyer!! Can't wait for the release of Season7!!!! I've pre-ordered mine at the...other place. :)"
5,All time favorite DE book,"When I was in college, I tried to solve as many problems as I can and read as many books on one single subject as possible. This is one of the best book on elementary differential equations that I studied. It's especially helpful if you are learning the subject on your own--the book has solutions to most of the problems in case you are stuck. The classic Deprima Differential Equations is too boring for me; Edwards' slightly better. But this one is my all time favorite!"
3,transducer schems,"i want to read about the transducer design and its types. and i want if you may to print little information about it, so i hope that you will help me for this important subject , and i'll be so glade. thankyou"
4,Exact replacement,"The motor I received was an exact replacement for the old one. Just bolted it in like the old one, inspite of warnings in on-line postings that many replacements require re-drilling one hole.Some instructions about reinstalling some of the other parts would have been helpful (the spring took some trial and error)."
4,Pulses with quirky energy channeled through a cerebral amalgam,"A quick perusal of the guest conspirators on ""Mylab"" leaves me scratching my head. I know of Danny Barnes and Bill Frisell but only have vague tinges about the others on board, including Skerik, Eyvand Kang, Keith Lowe, and Robin Holcomb. That's enough to confirm that this will be a madcap adventure.And it is.Mylab, the self-titled CD, pulses with quirky energy channeled through a cerebral amalgam of music, voices, and noises that are propelled by the efforts of Tucker Martine and Wayne Horvitz. The composites (a better word than compositions in this case) cover and embed distinctive elements from all kinds of music. Some are smooth and other are jagged.Most are fun."
3,PINK lily,"The print is beautiful, but its actually PINK not purple as it looks on screen. and although the print is nice, its hard to find a frame that fits. it took me two months but i finally found one for 10 dollars at the national wholesale liquidators. so if you do buy the print make sure you have a frame and i dont recommend spending 150 dollars for the framed print that is being sold here by the same seller that actually told me that he didn't have any frames for this print. just shop shop shop around and you will find it. even if you pay 20, 25 dollars for a frame online or wherever else, its much cheaper than 150. i hope this helps."
3,Perfect...without the Bulb,"I loved the appearance of this banker's lamp, most of all the white shade. But alas, when the light is turned on, the glare is fierce. After weeks of trying unsuccessfully to adjust to the level of glare, I resorted to buying a spray-on opaque paint, and spraying both the underside of the shade and the outside with several coats. Finally, no glare. Unfortunately, the lamp now little resembles the one I purchased."
2,QUALITY OF THIS HONEY NOT CONSISTENT,"I had received a jar of this lavender honey for this past Christmas and it was so good, I could not wait to order another jar. When I received the new jar, I opened it right away to smell the aroma of the lavender in the honey and to my horror, the honey wasn't honey. I looked like some kind of spread. It was not fluid at all, it was hard as a paste. The taste was off also. I wrote to complain but never heard a word about it. This honey is not inexpensive. For the money it should always be good. Was it the very cold weather that ruined it or was it already like that when it was shipped from France? I won't be ordering this item anymore."
5,SAT Prep - the condensed version,"If your chances of getting your child to study in advance for the SATs is minimal, this is the book for you. I examined many SAT Prep books, and this one offered the ""condensed"" version of what all the others included. For a quick review, it's great, and certainly less expensive that other prep products."
5,Solves a common problem,People familiar with the X-10 technology know that in the USA the 110v wiring is derived from a 220v input that is split. Often part of the house is wired to one leg and the rest of the house is wired to the other leg. The X-10 signal can't jump from one leg to another leg without the help of some capacitor or X-10 bridge.Two sides of my living room are on different legs. Side 1 was on the controller leg and worked fine. Side 2 wouldn't work. I placed Compact Powerhouse X10 Plug-In RF Wireless Tranceiver Module TM751 into Side 1 of the living room and another one into Side 2. Now X-10 control modules work on both sides of the room with the X10 HR12A 16 Device Palm Pad Remote Control for X10 Receivers.I call this a poor man's bridge. Real X-10 bridges cost 10 times as much.
4,Great Product - but it isn't a 3 conductor module,"The description states that it's like all other appliance modules. Except for the fact that it doesn't have a ground. It's only 2 conductor, whereas the other appliance modules have 3 conductors. But everything else is true and great. It is a simple on/off module (no dimming). And I, too, use it to bridge 2 legs in my house. When you have 2 separate legs in your home, one part of your home won't communicate with another part. As the other reviewer stated, if you have 2 wireless transceivers in your home, each on it's own leg, then you have a bridge!It will switch on and off on channel 1 only and it does make a loud clicking sound when it does this. My work around it to not use channel 1 for anything."
4,Great Product that still works,Great wireless system. Finicky range but if you can find the right socket in your home it works great. This is cheaper at Fry's Electronics.
1,Defective,"I plugged it in and tested several commands with the wireless remote. It smoked and blew the circuit breaker after several cycles. I returned it, but haven't gotten my refund yet."
2,X10 Transceiver Confusion,"My new TM751 Transceiver did not work with my older handheld remote. It did control the 'other' modules but not the fan connected to the TM751. Waiting to see if it works with an ordered new remote. Advice: Consider ordering the ""X10 RF Handheld Remote Control System"" that includes both the Remote Control and a 'different' Transceiver (with a on/off button) to be sure the Remote Control and the Transceiver work together properly. Apparently the Transceiver with the on/off button (""RR501 RF Based Transceiver Module"") is not sold separately at Amazon but is available at the X10 Superstore."
4,Wireless receiver,The X-10 receiver worked perfectly out of the box. It solved my limited coverage problem. It is now used with another receiver to cover the house. Works fine at a great price.
4,Compact Powerhouse X10 Plug-In RF Wireless Tranceiver Module TM751,"No dim, makes loud clicking noise when turned on and off. Cheap antenna and does not remember last setting. A must have with the x10 mini remotes."
1,Defective,"Failed to function. Tech support ""walked"" me through a test to determine it was defective. I returned it and ordered another one."
1,Very poor manufacturer,"I did not buy this X10 product but I did have this experience with this manufacturer.I originally bought a home security system from the manufacturer directly X10. What a mistake, the salesman told me it could have an exterior alarm but after two months of trying to make it work (Often I waited 5 to 7 days before someone got back to me) they gave up and told me it would not work and never should have been promised in the first place. They also use an antiquated way of sending messages to indoor sirens that causes all sorts of problems. Eventually, they offered a refund and I have been waiting over 3 months to receive it. I think this manufacturer might be the worst and possibly the most dishonest company I have ever dealt with."
3,Sounds like a tin can,I have ordered several aluminum and the copper doumbeks. I would rate them based on their sound quality as follows:1) Wood covered aluminum2) Vinyl covered aluminum3) Copper4) Bare aluminumThe bare aluminum versions are relatively the worst of them all.
2,There are better doumbeks out there,"I bought this doumbek a few months ago without knowing anything about the doumbek/darbuka. I have to say that after hearing and playing other darbukas out there, I was very diappointed to have bought this one. It is cheaper than other darbukas but the sound quality is just POOR. The slaps do not sound as crisp as they should, the teks sound like ur hiting a metal post, and the doums are just POOR. If you want to buy a real doumbek, I recomend either buying from Gawarhet El Fan, or Alexandria doumbeks. Meinl is garbage compared to them, at least in doumbeks they are. Look them up if u dont beleive me."
5,Outstanding Concert Footage,"I have been a Junkies fan since the mid 80's. I love all of their stuff. I have every album and each one is as good as the other, however, this one blew me away. Both the DVD and the CD are great. I enjoyed especially the version of ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Good Friday"". They also have a great live cover of ""Helpless"". I highly recommend this to any Cowboy Junkies fan."
2,"Works well for quick jobs, bad for extended use","Bought this product with low expectations and low $. My expectation were not exceeded... This product does do as specified, it routes, however, the plunge base doesn't retain depth settings very well, haven't used the other bases yet. Also, the motor would lock up on me if I used the router for more than 3 minutes. On one occassion I had to remove the brushes and unplug the device for 15 minutes for it to restart. However, for quick jobs or people just staring out with little $, this router is ok."
3,"Typical Microsoft product, big and buggy","It works better for route planing or finding addresses. Although this version particularly improved on integration with GPS and tried to add navigation functionalities, it is still very rudimentary. It's surprised to see how rigid and limited functionality this one has, when compared with a decent PDA based navigation software, such as TomTom. It hangs for 1 minute or longer when I try to use COM port to connect to my Bluetooth GPS unit. It takes a simple GPS program downloaded from web less than 1 sec to do the same thing. No 3D view mode for the map, which is a common feature for most PDA navigation softwares. Again, this is more suited for stationary use, rather than navigation."
2,Location Errors,I travel on an RV and have found many errors in the campground locations that were correct in the 2006 version. I will go back to the 2006 version.
1,"No instructions, poor help function","This might be the greatest mapping program in existance, but I would never know. Very user unfriendly. There is no instruction book provided with it (or available that I can find.) The help function is very poor and doesn't provide adequate instructions. If you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites."
3,Still not perfect,Slow does not keep up with GPS. Declares off route in error. Road Maps out of date. Needs online program update not just road construction.In spite of this still best deal out their for travel routing.
4,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2007,"It would be nice to make it more RV friendly, i.e. campgrounds, dump stations and places big enough to get your RV into & out of etc.W"
4,MS Streets and Trips,"Good product I have used in the States and in Nova Scotia, my only complaints are the required cables and the tangle it creates in the car. If I were to buy it over again I'd go with a blue tooth connected gps reciever and reduce the clutter."
2,Nice Maps Horrible Navigation,"I have had 2 different software applications on my PDA for navigation and both of them are a thousand times more functional and much more user friendly. But, I wanted to be able to use the 12 inch screen on my tablet PC as I travel for my appointments every day. I chose Streets and Trips 2007 because I had used the maps from an earlier version and the professional reviewers talked about the improvements in this version. This software is so hard to use and lacks many of the features that the simple PDA software had. I am toughly disgusted with Microsoft for this product."
2,I don't know how it works...,I coordinate transports for homeless dogs and thought this program would be a time-saver. But it is not user-friendly software. It will take me way longer to figure it out than to just route everything by hand. I was looking for easy.I opened the box and then discovered it was a DVD... I don't have a DVD player on the computer where I needed to use this so I wasted my money. This is my fault for not paying attention to what I was ordering.
1,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 DVD,"I'm sure it's a good program, but I accidently ordered a DVD, not a CD and don't have a DVD player on my computer, so I can't even use it. Maybe I'll find someone who has a DVD player and give it to them. Why can't the format do both CD/DVD anyway?"
4,I don't have a DVD Player!!,"OK...I'm assuming that this is a great product, but since I don't have a DVD player in my computer, I wouldn't know. I love the 2006 version."
4,Shipping Time Frame is WRONG!,"Yes I like the product, but Amazon misleads you about when they can ship it. Said USUALLY ships in 24 hours and I paid more to get 3 to 5 days shipping. Now they email me saying there is a delay (AND YOU CAN'T CANCEL THE ORDER). I ordered on Oct. 17, 2006 and their email now says the new est. date is Oct. 26th through Oct. 29th. AND...what is NOT funny... the web site says if you order it NOW you get free 2nd day delivery. I guess they needed my software to sell to someone else. They are still making me pay for the 3-5 day shipping and the only way I can stop this order is to wait until it arrives and either reject it (won't happen since this is a company) or I'll have to spend my dime, time, and trouble to return it. WATCH OUT about AMAZON misleading you on the availability."
2,Cons outweight benfits,"I have other software, and if I am sticking to highways, I generally prefer Streets. For more varied trips, it is no longer as reliable as it once was. The biggest problem is that Microsoft will not update its maps. There are many errors on it and because of construction of new highways, many roads are missing.The software lets you give feedback and report errors, but Microsoft does not correct the reported errors. I guess the feature is to make you feel good about something.I have bought several versions of Streets and will not buy any more until they update their maps."
1,No longer includes Pocket Streets,"I purchased Streets and Trips to use with a Windows Mobile 5 PDA and Bluetooth GPS reciever. As I was looking around at various gps software and maps, I decided on Streets and Trips intending to use Pocket Streets even without the ability to give turn by turn routing due to some reviews of Street Atlas claiming the maps were often inaccurate causing mistakes in it's routing.I was quite shocked when I installed Streets and trips 2007 and found it no longer included Pocket Streets.If you are not using a laptop, pass on this."
3,A new splash screen,"A new splash screen...that's about all I could tell that is different between this and the 2004 version. I'm sure there are a few other things that have changed, but nothing that affects how I use it. If you are thinking of upgrading, don't bother...because Microsoft certainly didn't bother to make any worthwhile improvements."
3,limp software,"Conveniences:Exporting maps to PDA.It's there when the internet goes down.Inconveniences:Major roads are often only listed at SR-23423 or some other technical name. While this might be cartologically indisputable, the rest of the world, including businesses, street signs, and locals use something called ""street names"", like ""Lawrenceville Hwy"" or ""Apple Avenue"" or whatever. This renders the program unusable in certain circumstances. Thus, I find myself constantly using yahoo and google to find addresses in Atlanta.I don't know if the 2007 ver has updated anything about New York City, but earlier versions of the program are downright useless with regard to the city: subways stations, one-way street directions, and street names are cluttered beyond reasonable use.Need to find your way from Buffalo to Miami? Great.Need to find a local address? You'll be fussing around with it."
2,Streets & Strips,"A let down. This version went backwards and gives less, aside from being able to update road info from the web. Still can't default save to anything but the C drive, having to manualy direct it to your drive used for saving files. In Route Options, setting speed is now a deviation from Average Speed, What is average speed? Who's average speed. Prefered roads still require you to manualy over ride freeways rather than the roads I select. I'd reccomend buying DeLorme products or others and skip this PORC(Piece Of Redmond _RAP)."
1,Poor Product,"I had upgraded from version 2005, which was a fairly decent product. The 2007 version no longer has direct internet searches, which was the best part of 2005. The new Windows Live search feature is useless. The GPS was constantly losing signal. I have return the product to Amazon. I hope they will give me something back for this junk."
5,Great Service!,Excellent delivery time. Product was as described and will do business with this seller again.
5,Chilling glimpse of near future,"Out of oil by 2050, or 2040 , or 2080 and shortages long before then. Potable water.. scarce now and getting scarcer (one of the roots of the 67 Arab-Israeli War was water rights). The facts roll over the reader, dispassionate and almost mindnumbing in detail. Population growing far beyond any capacity to maintain (The population of Ethiopia in 1950 was 18 million, the projected population in 2050 will be 212 million!)Civil wars, wars by proxy, the depletion and devastation of irreplacable old growth forests, rainforests, whole fragile ecosystems gone in a decade. And these are facts....facts no reputable scientist will argue other then exactly WHEN the resources will be finally depleted. The feeling I got at the end of the book was that we are all 'fiddling' as our world starts to burn."

3,Ultra low budget crapfest,"This is the first of the Maria collections I have seen. Both movies are set in 80's NYC. Both are extremely cheap and trashy. As far as B movies go these really scrape the bottom of the barrel. Picture quality is pretty good. Riot on 42nd has lots of outdoor shots of the city which I really enjoyed. I was a bit disappointed in the extras. There are a lot of trailers which was nice. There is a music video of Maria which is awful and unwatchable. There is an option to watch the movies with Maria. This is just a 30 second introduction by her, she does not give any commentary during the movie. They missed a big chance her as there is tons to make fun of in both films. Consider this just for the movies, the Maria packaging does not add anything at all."
4,Nutritional Yeast is grown on GMO sugar beet 'molasses',"I love nutritional yeast cooking. But as far as I can tell there is no company who guarantees their yeast is not grown on GMO sugar beet syrup. Unfortunately I haven't found anyone growing it on organic sugar. So this most likely makes it a GMO food, even though Red Star states the yeast itself is not genetically modified. Sort of the vegetarian version of feeding cows GMO feed, then claiming the meat itself is non-GMO. The reason they genetically modify many plants is so that they can dump tons of chemicals on the plants, which is about as far from organic as you can get. Bad for the soil, the bees, us, and everything that feeds on the chemical-laden plant, including the nutritional yeast and those who eat it.Bummer."
5,1st time parent,"Very cute brag book. The ribbon trim and thick cover give it a nice, 'like you spent money on it' feel. The first page allows you to write the baby's info such as height and weight. It holds 40 pics altogether. Because it came in a 2-pack we had one for each set of grandparents."
4,"Nice nailer, order nails on line","If you want a nailer that can use various length nails, holds quite a few nails, and does not have the long nail holder that gets in the way then this is the one. Go on line and order nails the same time you order this nailer as you will not find nails in most if not all stores in your area. You can always call Porter Cable at 888-848-5175 and order nails. I found they were cheaper and easier to deal with than others."
4,great show,great show. Has a great plot and lots of twists that will keep you watching. To bad they killed off one main character early
5,Greatest Ever!!,This is by far the greatest show that even on television. I have no complaints. The only thing I can say is watch and you will understand.
3,"Interesting story, but sometimes think the writers are demented...","Refer to the Lord of the Flies on occassion and the similarity applies. The writers always end the show on a cliff hanger to keep your interest in watching the next episode. As the characters are developed, the lives they led prior to the crash are revisited to give some background about them. I am drawn into the story and the characters as they are explained and it adds interest to the plot. It does seem as the series continues that the writers are working pretty hard to come up with the next round of adventures. It is a bit shallow in that when a character is killed, the remaining people usually seem to take little notice and just move right on with the new routine."
5,Pretty dope shizznazz,"When i first played the game by squaresoft, i found myself blown away by some of the game's music. Tracks such as Hollow Bastion and Forze Del Male are some of the most beautiful musical scores i have heard in a while. It also features instrumental versions of classic songs, like Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid) and This Is Halloween (Nightmare Before Christmas). Add in the great mix of upbeat songs (Simple and Clean comes to mind) with the more morose tracks (the End of the World theme, for example), and you get what is, in my opinion, one of the best video game soundtracks available. I strongly reccomend it."
4,"Pleased so far, but I haven't used it alot","I purchased this framing gun after buying a PC finishing nailer that I abosolutely loved. So far, I have been pretty happy. The first nail out of the gun didn't even make it to the wall. Ever since, it has worked like a charm. I am a home hobbiest and thought that such a large and bulky nailer would be cumbersome to work with, but I have been amazed how well it ""feels"" in my hand and how little problem I have had with the bulk. Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase."
4,"Works great, reliable","I've been using this nailer for about a month now, working on finishing my attic. It certainly makes the job much easier and faster. I've been through about 1,000 nails so far without a misfire. Overall quality seems to be excellent. It's easy to use and to adjust. My only disappointment is that it did not come with a case, which is the reason for only four stars. The FR350 is a less expensive model but comes with a case while the FR350MAG comes in a cardboard box. (sigh)"
5,Pleased so far!,"Have used this tool on one small job so far (shot about 1250 nails, two different sizes) and it is as reliable as advertised. Does not wear you out when used all day. I have used a Bostitch nailer previously, and the 350MAG is clearly the better nailer. I am a DIYer, and not a pro. This nailer should last me for a lifetime."
4,Pretty darn good!,"I like this CD. It starts out with a couple of strong songs, stays consistently good through the middle, and starts its ending with a really great song by G-2000. Hard-driving dance/house music (but not ""High Energy"") with lots of good beats and drum rolls. There are a few comps out there that I've heard which are as good or better (Trancemission #1 is a real fav...) but I wasn't at all disappointed w/Trance Addiction."
2,BAD CHEESE!!! DON'T WASTE MONEY!!,"I bought this CD brand new for little money and I was happy I didn't pay more than that!! This CD starts out with a weak intro by Corsten, and then progresses into something that seems to be improving, but after another couple songs, the cheese starts up again. Bellini totally RUINED track 7, ""Sparkles"" by ""Tiesto"". I couldn't even recognize the track!! Overall, there are only 2 to 3 decent tracks on the whole CHEESY CD. There are only two types of CHEESE in music: Good Cheese & Bad Cheese. This one is the Bad Cheese."
1,Junk,Got one of these quick shipped to help a hurt employee drive rods. Tried it out in lawn in front of shop/office. Got a 5/8 galvanized rod about 4 feet into ground and the driver came apart. It broke right at the junction between the holder and the shaft. Metal looked like pot junk. Sent it back.
4,Good Sequel,"I have played Ghost Recon since the beginning and they keep getting better & better. As far as new features, this game doesn't have a whole lot, but the gameplay is the same great shooter as the previous games. This game is quite a bit harder than the previous Ghost Recon 2, but with strategy it is beat-able. A must have for the Ghost Recon fan."
2,Would be great if it loaded,"I'm a huge fan of the whole Ghost Recon franchise, and was very excited to get this game. But, as it turns out this game hardly ever loads, even if my Xbox recognizes it as an actual game, which rarely happens. The ""red X"" occurs too often to count. This is probably the most unstable Xbox out there. Which is too bad because on the occasions it does work it is just awesome, cool new maps, and weapons with some of the annoying attributes fixed. If it only worked it would be great. I would hold out on buying this and wait until Ghost Recon 3 comes out, we can only hope that they invested more time and energy in the code of that game."
5,Exceptional,This book provides vivid charachters and Pioszak's narrative ability is first rate. I enjoyed the interplay between the principals and the subtle / surprising evolution of the storyline. I didn't anticipate the finale.
1,Where is the CD?,I am really ticked off about this. Where is the CD????? I can't afford an ipod and I really don't want to listen to my music that way either. Disney needs to release the CD as well.
4,"""A Christmas Carol"" is a fantastic album!",I stumbled on this wonderful CD and took a chance on it. The score is absolutly TERRIFIC and the performances are super. It should be in every music collection!.
1,Disney is the Scrooge !,"Still no CD and 2011 Christmas is nearing? Is Disney trying for the Super-Scrooge Award? Not all of us have ipods and MP3 hook-ups. So, Disney why not do what your movie said "" share with one an all"" !"
2,Hey Disney Where is the Soundtrack.,"I cannot believe one viewer said it would be to costly to produce a cd of This fabulous Christmas Carol release,but wait a minute did they not do a princess cd with only 8 tracks that apparently no one bought.But my local best buys said this movies blu ray release sold out in one day,so hey Disney I know you have your own manufacturing plant so lets get a cd out on this movie.One other negative years ago when Disney started releasing there movies on dvd the discs were all scratched apparently from where they were made,years went by and the movies on dvd started to get better in quality,now when i get the blu ray and dvd realease of this Christmas carol,we are back to scratched discs,I returned 2 copies of this blu ray and all three times the same discs were scratched and marked.Come on disney lets give the public the quality they expect."
1,No CD?,Selling music in a downloadable format only is discriminatory. What about folks who can't afford iPods? Doesn't Disney want to reach the broadest audience? It's unfortunate that this item and others like it will never be available in a public library for all to enjoy.
2,The live songs are fairly awful for purists,This single in a way shows how much Jamiroquai has diverged from its funk roots. The 2 live songs Bad Girls (with Anastasia) and Titan are more like electro dance songs than anything resembling Jamiroquai.The saving grace here is the Mondo Grosso Remix of Love Foolosophy. It is a gentle acoustic version much along the lines of Girl from Ipanema. A beautiful little song and well worth the trouble to hear.
4,Back With Bite,"Rayne is back to kick some vampire butt. She's now searching for her half-siblings so she can kill them. Lovely family. I liked how it was different than the first game and didn't follow the exact same plot line. I enjoyed--most of the time--the new acrobatics that were available to the player and the guns were a cool idea. I think this one was a little less annoying than the first, but it still stayed true to the original with the way she feeds and fights."
2,Had to send it back,"The gig bag might have been a good bag, but it was too small for the Dean Playmate that I bought it for."
5,Getting to the core of the problem,The book focusses on the root problem behind all those dysfunctional metrics around us. It explains very clearly (also for people not trained in financial jargon) how the wrong focus on the wrong metrics in the top of the organization can have impact on the complete organization and may impact negatively the quality of decisions throughout the company.Very much recommended!
3,Mississippi,"It's a little boring. The ""mississippi"" is in fact quite small. Nothing to write home about, but it really was the simplest Mississippi charm available."
3,thought it was a Pelican case when I bought it...,"The case worked well for the teleprompter my client purchased for it, but I'm a loyalist in the brands I purchase. I thought it was a Pelican brand case, but to my dismay... it wasn't. Like I said, the case is great and all, but it didn't seem to be as tough and rugged as the same size Pelican case that protects some of my other gear. Needless to say, I wasn't too disappointed when I had to return the case & gear to the client. :)Pelican 1600 Case w/Foam (Black )"
2,What's all the hype?,"I don't get why Kindermusik has become so popular. I bought this for a class, and to be quite honest, if my friend weren't the teacher, I would have dropped the class a LONG time ago.I guess I'm comparing this Milk and Cookies class to another music class that I took my kids to in Utah, and that's probably not fair, because the other class was phenomenal.Maybe if I didn't already have that great experience to compare it to, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. But the fact remains that I was disappointed.These songs just aren't all that catchy, and they certainly aren't memorable."
4,Radio Flyer Retro Rocket,"I bought 2 of these this past December for my twin 18 month old nephews. Needless to say, they are a big hit. The seat jiggles when the rocket gets ready to take off -- cool idea but the twins are a little afraid to fully sit on the seat until it stops moving. As they are playing with it more and more their butts are getting closer to staying on the seat. Very retro look and feel. Parents, Aunts and Uncles will be reminded of toys from their childhood."
5,Purchased for 1 yr old boy,I have many nieces and nephews who all have little ones and I always use your age guide to pick out gifts for these little great nieces and nephews of mine. I have never been disappointed with the selections and neither have the children. It seems this particular red rocket really attracted my little great nephew and he loves all the buttons and lights and noises it makes. It's fast become a favorite of his. I would highly recommend it to all.
4,Wonderful Toy,"We bought this for our son's birthday. He loves it and we have had it for over two years. (My little boy is small for his age though) The only thing that I don't like about it is the decorations on the sides are stickers just like with any other toy. After time they start to come off, but my son doesn't care. He really loves this toy."
5,Perfect Gift!,"I bought this for my son's First birthday. He LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it! It is a perfect size for him to be able to climb onto. And if he happens to fall off of it, it is low enough to the ground that he doesn't get hurt. It doesn't steer, but he get around just fine... I think steering would be too much for him anyway. He gets a kick out of the sounds it makes.. he loves to push buttons. The only problem is that my 3 year old loves it just as much and they fight over whose turn it is to play on it!!"
4,The BIG HIT at Christmas,"I got this for my 2 year old twin nephews for Christmas. My only mistake was not buying 2 of them so they wouldn't fight over it! Durable enough for two rambunctious toddlers to grapple over and they LOVED the buttons, lights and sound! It was really great purchase and I love the vintage design."
5,Our 1 year old LOVES it!,"I just bought this for my sons first birthday! He just loved it, he climbed right on and started pushing the bottons, he hasnt gotten that you have to push it with his feet but he will get it soon. Right now my husband just pushes him around on it and he loves it. He doesnt have any problem getting on and off either. I would recommend this toy to anyone. We all love it. I didnt like that you have to put it together yourself, I thought that was a little stupid. But other than that it is great!"
4,Great for smaller riders!,"This was a xmas gift for my one year old. He immediately liked it. He likes to push it around, push the buttons and hear the cool sounds and vibration and open/close the seat (and put things inside) as well as push it around and look at the lights on the back. There are lots of things to 'do' with this toy.Now to the riding.... it is one of the few ride-on toys that a younger toddler can get on and off themselves. From early on he was able to get on it and push himself around.Last but not least, it looks very cool!"
3,Very small,"In the picture you would think this was a little bigger, very durable and entertaining for a child, but very upsetting to see the size."
3,"Great looking toy, so so on the fun scale",I bought this for my son for Christmas last year (he was 2). It was so small for him. He was passed a car that you just sat on an pushed buttons. He was too big to ride and I am not sure smaller kids can ride it. My nephew is 8 months old and loves it. He loves to climb on it and push buttons. JUst don't expect too much out of the great looking toy.
3,Dissapointing,"Very dissapointed. The item is much smaller than it appears in the online photo. I expected a solid, bulky piece that ended up being a very tiny ride-on. My nephew is large for his age, but the Retro Rocket won't size up past his 8th month, let alone wait till Christmas."
5,Super Cool,This is great retro toy. The voice and sounds on it are similar to a 1950's style. This toy looks great and is fun for my son to ride.
5,Ian's favorite toy!,"My ten month old baby boy loves this toy.. he doesn't ride on top of it though.. he walks with it, climbs on it, and most of all pushes it and makes car noises! It is a must have. We love watching him learn what the buttons do and it really makes him laugh!"
3,Simple toy that toddlers love,"My son used it for a while, because he has this fascination with airplanes. Unfortuntely for him, he quickly outgrew. So I got him a ride-on remote control airplane. He still doesn't know how to stir it, so I am stirring it with the remote control. He occasionally sits on this toy. If your kid doesn't have a fascination with airplanes, I am not so sure if this would be the toy for your toddler....."
4,Radio Flyer Retro Rocket,My grandson loves his Radio Flyer Retro Rocket. However I was somewhat disappointed when it arrived and realized it was made of plastic. A few years ago I had purchased the Radio Flyer Classic Little Red Roadster for another grandson and it was made of metal; it can be something he passes down to his children. I'm afraid the Radio Flyer Retro Rocket will not last because of the plastic. I should have read the description about the product before purchase it.
5,Grandson's 1st Birthday,The rocket ship was the hit of my grandson's first birthday party. Once he saw it we could not get him off of it. Not only does he ride it but he also pushes it. I am so glad that I found this for him. This is a fabulous toy but it is also educational and motivational as it is teaching him how to use his legs and feet to move it along. We are hoping that this rocket ship will help him walk sooner.
4,The kids love it,"I ordered this toy from Amazon without being able to see it in person. The rocket is on the smaller size. I was sort of disappointed in the size. It is comparable to a little tykes push car. It is definately for a 1-3 year old. Though my five year old plays with it. She really likes to push her one year old brother on it. The seat/under seat storage hinge is plastic and seems flimsy. If you want to push your tot on it you have to hold on to the fins. They are not little tikes plastic. They bend a little when pressure is applied, so be careful not to break them off. It has great sound affects, and the vibration is an attention grabber. My kids love it. It is played with everyday. My son climbs on and grunts and rocks(his way of asking to be pushed around). No problems yet. It is pricey in my opinion. [...] I am glad the children love it."
3,Great fun-but too small.,"My son received this as a present at 1 year and loves it. The sound effects are great and the look it fabulouse. But at 16 months and 24 pounds when he sits and pushed the rocket he sometimes goes head over the front and lands on his face. The rocket is too front heavy.My two kids love to play with the rocket -they push it alot and even my 4 year old can manage to sit and push the low toy -but after several ""face plants"" we are a bit more careful ."
4,Adorable ride on toy,My son recv'd this for his first birthday and loves to ride it..when he can wrestle his older brother out of it! The sounds it makes and the lights on the end are just too cute! We have definitely enjoyed seeing the boys have fun with this toy! :o)
5,The Russia House,"`Spying is waiting'. So believable. Unlike the breakneck speed of events of popular espionage fiction, John Le Carre takes us into the REAL world of spying where you do your bit and wait for the reactions. Things don't happen at the speed at which we wish them to.His characters don't speak from high moral grounds, so typical to Tom Clancy's characters. Nor they are reluctant heroes of Robert Ludlum. They are real people, afraid, greedy, selfish, people who you can relate with, people who don't have the power to eliminate the evils of the world single-handedly. These are the people who know that the evils are here to stay, and in some sense they are also part of it. Elimination of evil will mean self-destruction. They just play the part in the manner they are told to and wait to get out of the evil-machine of espionage. `Spying IS waiting'****Precaution: Stay away from the movie if you haven't read the novel."
2,Did Not Like It - Found a Better One,"This case was too snug and had no place for extra batteries, cards or the lens attachments which come with the camera. The case attaches directly to the camera and I found that, when I opened it, the flap was in the way of taking pictures. I ended up returning this case and buying the Sony LCS-HA case which had more room and is very comfortable to carry."
1,Review Soft Carrying Case,According to Sony this case is the fit to the Sony camera I recently bought. In my opinion; the case does not fit as well as I would expect. The remaining empty space (when camera is packed) is not to be used for anything else because of the way the case opens when use of camera.In short; I am not happy with the product which was also not cheap since it is a sony product)
5,Very satisfied,"I was very leary of ordering jewelery online, and was concerned the reviews might be written by ""company plants,"" but both my wife (most importantly) and I were happy with the earrings. They arrived quickly delivered by USPS to our secure mail box and not on our front step, further easing my mind. The carat,color, cut and clarity of the earrings were as promised, so long as the prices on Amazon remain competitive I will order more jewelery from them again"
4,Julie's Awesom reviews,"Hi! If you haven't read Jessica Saves the Trees, you should! It's awesome!it's about this girl with no life who goes to save trees in her spare time cuz she's got nothin better to do. thats aboutit!"
5,The Best Training Wheels Your Money Can Buy!,"Your Lil Tots are only small once so why not give them the best?!I bought these for my four year old son and he loves them and they have given him alot of confidence.....He even did a mini pop a wheely!Seriously all the moms on the block are asking where we got these and want a pair for their Tikes because they are tired of the cheap pairs breaking,tipping over,or cracking.When my son retires these soon I will still be able to get use out of these for his smaller sister because these are so sturdy and well made. Definately Worth Every Penny."
4,I've Used this Program for Years and It's Great,"I'm writting this review to correct some reviews on this site which are very unfair, written by users who seem to have only tried out DesignCAD for a couple of days.I've used DesignCAD for years, for everything from designing furniture to creating 3D models for a mathematics class and it has been able to do anything I ask of it. Easy to use. Versatile to customize. Adaptable with 2 scripting tools, one simple enough for a non-programmer, the other the full-blown Visual Basic for Apps. If you want an honest appraisal, go to http://forums.upperspace.com to get the opinion of devoted users who have been loyal to this wonderful program for many years.Don't let the low price fool you."
3,Silent Night,"I find this product to be very good, it helps me sleep better than most other products I have tried. Thank you very much."
5,Great All Purpose Nailer,"This is a great all purpose nailer. I have used it for installing wood shingles and strapping and it has worked flawlessly. For strapping it is lighter and has greater nail capacity than a stick framing gun for working overhead. It is lightweight, although not as light as the Hitachi siding gun, but is more versatile. All adjustments are easy, I especially like the depth of drive adjustment wheel (no tools needed) nail size selector and air deflector. My neighbor used it to install strapping in her basement and after a 5 minute demonstration she was all set to go and loved using it. I own many other Porter Cable tools and use them on a daily basis in my contracting business, they all work great. I personally think they make the best sanders around. Part of my decision to own them is that if they ever need service I am less than an hour away from a Porter Cable (Company) store."
4,great gun but pretty heavy,"I bought this as a backup to my Duofast siding nailer. This gun is fast, consistent, no misfires, or double fires, but it is heavy, 6 pounds. I looked at the weight of the other PC Coil350 magnesium nailer, but it was even heavier. Great gun for occasional use."
3,Works fine,"However, I have to wonder why it has a manufactured date of July 2009. Where the heck has it been for the last three years????!!!!???? Thus the 3 star rating."
5,Paper Route CD,"This CD came in mint condition even though it was described as ""used"". Exceptional quality, timely arrival and I am not disappointed."
3,Weird puzzle.,"We finished both puzzles in one afternoon. Not challenging at all. We separated the night and day pieces right off the bat and worked on one at a time - and it was not hard to separate the night/day pieces because the color tones are completely different. The puzzle pieces are also very bizarrely shaped, which made it easy to find pieces that fit together, and now that they are finished they look a little strange close up. The puzzles do look cool, we framed them together and hung them up, but if you are looking for a challenge, this isn't for you."
1,Oy vey,"Awful, awful production! Against Beethoven Lives Upstairs, I had expected another childrens' masterfilm. This, however, was a low-budget, poorly acted reproduction (nearly word-for-word) of the audtio CD, which is infinitely better.Don't waste time or money."
3,OK DVD,"I'm glad to have an almost age appropriate DVD for my students, but I own DVD's on other composers that are more interesting to watch. Maybe Grades K-3 would enjoy it more than my 5th graders."
3,Music History,"I loved ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs"" and hoped this would be as good. It has nowhere near the depth of story nor quality of acting. However, it is educational and moderately entertaining."
5,Mr. Bach comes to Call,"I am a music teacher a a private school for students grades 4 - 8. I showed the film to grades 4,5,6 after studying the life and times of Johann Sebastian Bach. The movie is an accurate portrayal of the elements in Bach's life. He talks about the time in which he lived, his family, the available instruments, his compositions and works for different events. The little girl gives a wonderful representation of a young student who is frustrated with the amount of practice required to play an instrument well. As an adult, I thought this movie was charming and even funny at times. Well Done!!"
2,Not very useful,"Okay, you should get your first clue as to how tailored this software is to learning Latin from the claim ""Recording tools let you record your own voice, to compare pronunciation with a native Latin speaker.""There haven't been any native Latin speakers in quite some time. If they found some secret recordings of Cicero--- it would be worth quite a bit. And no, neither Latin America nor the Vatican count.You see Latin broke into many spoken dialects which later evolved into the various ""Romance"" languages. No one really knows for sure how the original Latin was pronounced.Very little grammar is taught in this software."
1,Horrible!,"The Beginners Level edition of Talk Now! has a total of 44 words of vocabulary with no grammar or further description. Three of the words are the numbers one, two, and three. Don't waste your money!It does however, install easily and has a nice, simple user interface. It requires the disk to be in the CD drive for copy protection. The diction is clear and the words are pronounced the way my Latin teacher pronounced them."
1,Do not waste your money!,"Do not waste your money on this recorder. It is pretty, but poorly made. Can't get a clean note out of it to save your life. Some of the notes don't work at all... nothing but air/no sound. I threw mine in the trash 5 minutes after I bought it. It wasn't even worth the time and money to return it."
2,Just Plain Unsatisfied,"Don't get me wrong. I like Nine Days, but I didn't like this album. I'm not sure what happened between 2000 when they made ""Madding Crowd"" and 2002, when they made this. With Madding Crowd, I liked ten out of twelve songs. With this, it's one out of 12 - ""I Feel Fine"" was pretty good. I couldn't stand the other ones (cheesy rhymes, bad tempo, bad lyrics, 'Won't let you dowwahowahaowwwwn...' in ""Everything"")."
4,early Immerseel,"This CD was recorded in 1979, but don't let that scare you off; there's none of the roughness of some older period-instrument recordings to be found here. The Rosenberger fortepiano c.1795 from the Finchcocks Collection sounds very sharp and clear, and Immerseel's performance is sparkling throughout. Clementi's sonatas are rooted in Haydn's while building a bridge toward Beethoven, Schubert, and even Chopin. They are less virtuosic, to be sure, and less ponderous (the longest clocks in around 14 minutes), but no less appealing or satisfying. It took a few listens before I started to really appreciate it, but this is excellent late-Classical piano music, and if you're looking for a good recording of Clementi: this is the one."
5,One of the best GRE books ever,"When I started preparing for the GRE, I bought the ubiquitous Kaplan Guide and after I took the practice test I was incredibly dissapointed in my scores. Picking up this book, I read through the strategies for answering questions correctly, and then returned to Kaplan and went through every question in the book, answering them as recommended in the Crash Course book. I got INCREDIBLE results -- one of my scores jumped 300 points from the practice test to when I actually took the GRE. If you are the type of person who is bad at standardized tests, THIS BOOK is what you need. I cannot recommend it strongly enough."
5,Watch these guys!,"I've been following Mile Post Nine for a while now, and these guys just keep getting better and better! This cd just proves that! The raw sound of Marc's voice and the awesome lyrics make this cd worth every penny! Kudos to the band on their latest effort! Can't wait to hear the newest cd, which will be out soon!"
2,"Good selection, Voices weird","I picked this CD because most of the songs on it were ones I used to sing growing up in a church in south-eastern Kentucky. When I began listening to the CD, although the background instrumentals were enjoyable, all of the voices sounded like they are coming from inside a metal box which totally ruined the CDs for me. I wish the producer hadn't mucked with what could have easily been a favorite CD collection of mine, but instead is now one which I will rarely listen to."
1,"Nice to look at, but keep away from moisture",Ever hear of a collander that rusts if you get it wet? Significant flaw...
2,Not so much...,"I got O Primeiro Canto and absolutely loved it. This live album was poorly recorded and poorly edited. (Or should I say, not edited) Much of the 2nd CD is a waste, about half of it being applause to the point of distraction. If you already love her and have her other CDs, by all means, get this one too. If this would be an introduction to her music, find a different one. This one leaves a lot to be desired."
4,So far so good,"I just bought this TV the 20th. I got it from Circuit City for around 3,236. Its great to play the Xbox 360 on and MLB 2k7 is awesome. You can see the catchers face through the mask. Still waiting for Direct TV to show up on the 26th. So I'll know more about this TV then. The Xbox 360 HD DVD player looks nice but so far I can only get 1080i not 1080p. I will come back to this site in a few days and I'd be more than happy to answer any question then. For those of you who have written a review, thank you it was a big help after all these months of research."
5,one of the best looking tv's,"the wait was well worth it. This tv is versatile for gaming, digital tv, satellite even for a computer. Sony continues to raise the bar for entertainment."
1,Sony's future is CLOUDY!,"Sony has had a lot of great products in it's past but as of late they have had a lot of misfires. This 46"" TV could have been the best LCD TV in the market, yet it fails. The colors are amazing, but when black comes on, MURA artifacts ruin the image. The reason for this problem stems to quality control and these sets are MADE IN MEXICO, so I assume they have problems there. My set was dated DECEMBER 2006 and had severe problems, so there is no way of getting a good one based on a date. It's such a shame, the TV is quite something.Sony, why can't you get it right anymore?"
3,did not meet expectations of an XBR,"I used to have and XBR Wega 38 inch Tube Monitor with 1080. With this one brightess in not that good, some features are missing such as pciture in picture. And the screen options are very confusing. Here with Direcyt tv and DVD you can see the pixels i did not see before. I was not worth the extra Sony $$$ for this high end TV"
1,CLOUDTACULAR PICTURE!!!!!,"Had 3 of these sets and all three were cloudy. The second not as bad as the first but the third was the worst of all. Wanted to try again but was given a refund instead. Save a bunch of time, hassle, disappointment, and most of all money and GET A DIFFERENT TELEVISION! I really wanted this tv to work. Beautiful styling and the absolute greatest PQ currently available is destroyed by the most annoying defect next to a stuck pixel, MURA. Don't even try to watch anything that has a dark scene in it because it will make you cry. If you do decide to roll the dice I hope you have better success at getting what you pay for: a television that is uniformly lit throughout the entire picture. You should demand it for what you are paying for the thing!!!"
1,Horrible clouds and back light problems,"This product is not worth the money!!!!! The XBR2 and XBR3 both have clouding, backlight problems. I got one yesterday and the clouding, backlight problems were horrible that after 1 day I returned this TV. My set had a backlight problem in the top left corner...it was so horrible and distracting.....many people have reported on avsforum about this problem ...some say that up to 70% of all XBR2's have this problem...Sorry SONY but the XBR2 and XBR3 needs some major work."
2,I have a cloudy XBR too!,"There is a major quality control issue with Sony LCD's presently. Just do a google search for ""xbr clouding."" Sony is playing hard ball saying that because their TV is the brightest and most colorful set in the world that backlight clouding, leakage, and uneveness is normal, refusing to help the little guy with fixing this defect. Please google the clouding xbr issue before purchase."
3,Overpriced and missing features,"For a top-of-the-line Sony, I would have expected the TV to have some basic features like PIP (Picture in Picture).Don't see much difference between this model and the much cheaper V-series except for the extra HDMI input and physical aesthetics."
2,MURA MURA MURA,"MURA! CLOUDS! INCONSISTENT BACKLIGHT! Whatever you want to call it, both Sony and Samsung have DEFECTIVE LCDs. I've had nothing but MURA problems with the Samsung so I went and bought a Sony, and guess what, it's worse! Unfortunately, if you want a large LCD (46"" and over) you will be stuck with clouds as the Sharp has it's own problems (banding) and the other manufacturers make garbage, so I would wait on this purchase."
1,Don't buy a bravia.,"Do not buy a Sony Bravia. Do your research first. You will discover the myriad of problems that have existed with this TV. Even though our tv started to have problems under the warranty, Sony was completely uncooperative at helping with the problem. I have to admit, the picture was beautiful until we started to get black lines across the screen. Although I've bought Sony TVs since the 1970's, I'll never buy another one"
4,good buy,"Only have the TV for like a month but so far so good! Great picture quality and sound. The only thing that make me slightly uneasy is that the TV look front heavy and I feel like it's going to tip over! The TV, however, comes with this belt for you to hold the TV down (screw to the back of the TV and then to your TV stand ...)."
3,Good While it Lasted,"Have had this TV for 5 years. I've enjoyed it for 4 years and 11 months. The picture was more than decent and the bezel is visually one of the most attractive I have every seen.I recently have had an interference scrolling screen taking over the normal picture and according to the U-Verse tech, my TV is a goner.It was my 1st LED and after a little research I've included that it died an untimely death. I paid a premium for Sony with the expectation of superior longevity.The average LED TV has a life span of 40,000 hours. The most I ever watch TV is 5 hours a day. Assuming even 6 hours a day 7 days a week, I still should have received close to 20 years of service.Onward and upward to Panasonic Plasma!"
2,COULD HAVE Been a Home Run for Sony ... Cloudiness,"Overall, the product could have been a home run for Sony, however, the LCD panel (on a number of units and communicated by others in numerous posts, forums and consumer reviews)displays unevenness in the black area of the LDC screen, where it resembles ""cloudiness"". Depending on the quality of the individual set produced at the factory, the cloudiness may be nominal or severe ... to the point it is very noticeable in dark scenes (e.g. througout the Diana Krall in Paris DVD). It is most noticed when watching in a dimly lit room (i.e. night time viewing). If you buy, buy with caution."
1,Defective!,"My TV has a date of Dec 2006 and it has the same problems that many others are reporting - clouds. Sony is aware of this problem, but are denying that's there's anything wrong with it. Do not buy until Sony admits there's a problem with this offically."
5,I'm looking for the BASE that comes standard with Sony's KDL46XBR2 LCD TV,"I'm looking for the BASE that comes standard with Sony's KDL46XBR2 LCD TV, but is detached when the TV is wall-mounted.My TV was professionally installed as a wall mount. I have now purchased a house and have moved from the townhouse I rented. A wall-mount isn't practical in the house I bought and so I want to stand the TV on a cabinet, but the base that came with the TV is missing (I assume the installers took it with them). I don't have a part number for the base. Perhaps someone out there has a wall-mounted 46"" Bravia and would like to sell the base that came with it?betobatres@hotmail.com"
1,Your Better Off NOT Buying this.,"I purchased mine back in 2007 on December 24th. A Christmas present to myself. By June of 2008, it began to show problems. By September 2009, I have a black hole sitting in my livingroom. To fix it, you have to replace the front panel at a cost of $1080.00. And Sony does not provide you any assistance at all. Your on your own. If you want Sony to replace it, you better buy the extended warranty otherwise you'll be sitting with a black hole in your room too."
5,The Greatest Television Ever,"This is the greatest television ever, just like the subject line of this review says. If it were possible to give ""Six"" stars, I would. Very pleased with this set - after six months of countless hours of viewing on all sorts of football, tv, movie circumstances. Great, great tv. Buy one, buy this one, and be very glad that you did. Only buy though, if you have the available $$$ for such a thing. Real great alternative is a Vizio, might not be the high-quality la-la of this one - but will save ya the dough, if thats your case. If you have it, and can spend it, spend it here on this model. The glass floating perimeter of the set never gets old to look at. Clean lines."
1,Awesome TV if you are lucky enough to get a good one,"I read the horror stories of people getting sets with ""Clouds"" but thought that perhaps it was being overblown and assumed it wasn't nearly as common as some were making it out to be. Nonetheless, I decided to spend a little more and buy the set locally just in-case I needed to return it. Sure enough, got the set home and it has the same clouds every one else is complaining about. It's really too bad the TV has this flaw, everything else about it is terrific."
3,Dont buy if you like watching sports!!!!!,"I recentley bought this Xbr2 from amazon for 3,159.99 which was a great price at the time still a lot of money for a TV. I hooked this LCD up and had some friends over to watch March madness ( Basketball) And this tv had what is called ""motion Blur"" LCD tv's still have issues with fast pace seens The picture was awfull! Besides sports the tv was great! If you plan on buying any kind of lcd and you watch sports make sure you get a 8ms or lower ""responce time"" and a 100hz or higher refresh rate then you will be ok. It seems like 40"" or smaller there would be less motion blur for lcd. I returned tv and amazon has been wonderfull to deal with!! I ended up buying a pioneer pdp-4270HD plasma which is awsome for watching anything including sports!! Very happy with this plasma."
2,A bit disturbing,"This video is age appropriate. BUT, the actors in it creeped me out. It had ""Ernest"" (you know, Ernest Goes to Camp, etc) with all his goofy faces and smokey voice, and the ""Barney"" type video clips didn't really mesh with the fact that it was a Bibleman video. Pretty low-budget, but my kids seemed to be OK with it."
3,"Body Shop White Musk Eau de Toilette, 2 oz","While this product was a value price, it seemed watered-down to me. The fragrance was good when first applied, but I found that it quickly wore off. Love the scent of the fragrance, though."
2,Too bad East Coast Bias affects box sets,"Yep, you can see by the cover picture that this only has six games: the two clinchers and the four WS games. Nice that Boston gets 11 games for their box set and we get only 6. No respect. Absolutely none. Every game the Sox won (except the first ALDS game) was close and had compelling storylines. This means we won't get the AJ ""dropped third"", the 1st-inning homers in consecutive games by Konerko in the ALCS, and many other great moments. I'll still buy this, but I will always be disappointed."
4,Reviewing the White Sox 2005 World Series Video,"I thought the video was well done. It was good to feature the clinchinggames of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four gamesof the World Sries. I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series againstBoston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series againstLos Angeles. Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-hoWhite Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years. A great viewing companion for those cold winter nights."
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty pumped to get the DVD collection of my beloved White Sox World Series run. I was dismayed to find out that the collection would not include all post season games. One of the games not included is a fairly memorable game Game 2 of the ALCS vs the Angels that had the much discussed incident with A.J. Pierzynski.Putting aside the missing games I horrified when I put the first disk in. Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, this is NOT an anamorphic widescreen transfer. The games were broadcast in 16:9 high definition so I cannot understand why the DVDs were not transfered this way. The DVDs are presented in a 4:3 letterboxed format. I found the games difficult to watch like this. If you don't have a high definition television then maybe this will not be an issue, but if you DO have a HD set (the only way to watch sports in my opinion) you will be disappointed."
2,Need All Games? This doesn't have them.,"I'm sure glad I digitally recorded each post-season game in its entirety, because this DVD special isn't worth it. My DVD's also have all the pre-game and post-game stuff and no commercials. I recorded Comcast's parade coverage, ABC channel 7's parade coverage, each game of the World Series, ALCS, and ALDS, so that's better than THIS collection. So, how are the ones I have compared to this collection? As I have discussed on the White Sox fan forum message board, much better. It's too bad this offering didn't live up to the hype--and hope."
4,Cheaper at Sam's Club,"For those of you who don't think Wal-Mart is ""taking over the world"" ;o) You can get this set at Sam's Club for $39.99! I picked it up there for my son, and was glad to see all the positive reviews - being the die-hard Chi-Sox fan that he is, I know he's going to enjoy this one . . . and I don't think he'll mind the fact that it doesn't include ""all the games"". 18+ hours of viewing pleasure s/b satisfactory."
4,"Porter-Cable COIL200 2"" Coil Nailer",positves:-manual depth of drive setting-rated at 2 inches but the magazine will hold 2 3/8 inch nails.-able to get nails at home depot (standard 15 degree coil)-has no trouble sinking 2 inch ring shank nails .092 dia.-best gun for the price-search the net(google.com-coil200)negatives:-not as light as some (ie:hitachi nv65ah)-should have made it with 2.5 inch nail capacity
4,great summary for a first-time visitor with limited time,"I visited Scotland in November 2003, and I found this book to be extremely useful. The book layout is clear and easy to read. The ""top 10 lists"" really help in deciding what to see. No extraneous photographs or excessive historical backgrounds. The book has very good general travel tips as well. The author doesn't assume you know everything about traveling to the UK. One suggestion: if touring Glasow or Edinburgh on foot or by car, buy a good city map. The city maps in the guide don't quite cut the mustard."
5,Her Best,"Buy it. This is a classic by one of the founders of modern Wicca. It is well written, engaging, and has stood the test of time. A must have for every Wiccan library along with Spiral Dance, The Witches Bible, and the works of Cunningham. Vivianne Crowley's Jungian interpretation of Wicca is well suited to understanding the Craft."
3,Validity of Jungian Wicca?,"I question the validity of Jungian Wicca. Jung was essentially an atheist, and back-masking his beliefs in support of one's religion just seems icky to me.There are a LOt of books that do what this one does, and I believe Cunningham and Buckland do it better.It really seems as if the Jungian langauge is an attempt to justify Wicca...Justify it to whom? The author's parents? Coworkers? the author herself?Wicca stands only without justification!"
4,nannies love them,"my kids's caretakers love these spoons, i'm ok with them, i can use either this or the Munchkin ones. I wouldn't rely on this to tell me the food's temperature, it's not that sensitive, just use common sense. Love size, long handle & good depth."
2,cheap quality,"I bought these spoons trying to save money because it appeared to be similar in shape to my Beaba spoons. When I opened the package, the cheap quality was apparent. I haven't used it yet, but there are plastic stubs that protrude around various parts of the spoon, thus I would hardly call it ""soft edge"". I think it maybe uncomfortable for my baby's delicate mouth."
2,not what was pictured,Be aware that if you purchase these spoons for the colors pictured ...that's NOT what you get. I bought these because of the neutral colors and received a pack with a hot-pink spoon in it :( not what I was looking for.
3,cannot get the stain out,"I like the feature of this spoon which it will change to white when it's hot. My son loves it because it is soft enough for his gum. However, when he eats carrot or sweet potato or any red color foods, it creates stained on it and I cannot get it out. I wish they think of using different color than white or use materials that won't get stain so easily and save for kids."
1,I suspect this to be a self-published book or vanity press item,"Last week my workplace received a copy of this book from Trillion Publishing, but no one here had ordered it. Today we received an invoice for it. Customers who receive unordered merchandise are legally entitled to treat the merchandise as a gift. The committee here who reviewed the book deemed it to be poorly written, a polemic, and non-objective."
2,A one-volume argument for renewing the Inquisition,I beg to differ with the other reviewers. This is a miserable piece of anti-Catholic claptrap. The book is endless and tiresome and has more false endings than I can count. Simutaneously contrived and stereotyped. Several time the characters stopped to confess that they did not know what was happening or whether they should continue with their pursuits. I had to agree with them -- I wish they'd just given up. The only reason I finished it was so that I could tell the person who lent it to me that it really was a waste of time.
1,Stale & boring!,"Although this book has been heavily publicised to encash upon the success of ""Da Vinci Code"", in reality it is rather predictable, full of characters lifted from soap-operas, unimaginatively narrated and (to sum it up) boring. Also, the entire concept of this book is dated and the onus is to thrash Pope Pius and the Catholic Church. Honestly, with eleven years research one can do better and is expected to do better. To check the veracity of my observation, please read ""Angels & Demons"" and spare yourself from this monstrosity."
2,Not that good,"I slogged throguh this book, having already commited myself to reading it, I felt obligated to to finish it. I was underwhelmed. Gifford is a good writer, though I think it dragged. The back story about the Church has the usual ""eveil in the Church"" conspiracy that I suppose you need for this. And, unlike Dan Brown's piece of junk, ""Angels & Demons"", Gifford receives high marks for his accuracy about life with tin the Church. However I'd give it a miss if I had to do it all over again. There have got to be better Vatican themed novels out there."
3,Certainly not the Da Vinci Code,"I read ""Praetorian"" (also by Thomas Gifford)and thought it was fun reading; and,as a bonus it gave some interesting insights into WWII in North Africa. So, thought I, Assassini will be good too. The book previews promised Assassini would ""expose"" the Catholic Church a la Da Vinci Code, but the plot exposed nothing bad about the Church--just sinister people involved with the Church. The book could have been several hundred pages shorter if Gifford hadn't hashed, rehashed and over-analyzed every aspect of the plot. It was as if he was afraid the reader was reading the book in 5-page increments and needed to be brought up-to-date every time the the book was opened. It wasn't a terrible book, but not a memorable one either."
1,12 x 12 WHAT?,"How can you know what the heck this is, other than it's listed in the Music Section? I love Patrick Cowley and if this IS 12 inch singles of his 12 top songs...which I can only deduce, then this would be a cool thing to purchase.Gotta give this product a bit more detail guys! Thanks"
5,Changed my life,Keeps my soup from spilling all over my fridge.Holds rice and beans together in one location.Clear enough to see what color mold is growing.
4,....,a little confusing with the arrangement of definitions. Hard to tell which definition co-incides with a word.
4,Growing Appreciation,"OK, at first, I wasn't particularly thrilled with this book. Maybe it's because I've been cooking for a crowd for awhile and hoped it would have more to offer. It's very basic. However, I am coming to appreciate its ""basic-ness"" and believe it's a good place to start if someone takes on a large crowd cooking challenge. Just having the information for how to estimate amounts of a particular food item is very nice; makes the math (at least for me!) much easier. I think the recipes are somewhat mundane, but again, since I've already come up with recipes that have worked successfully, maybe I'm not being fair. I think I came to respect the book and myself when I checked a recipe I've used against a similar one in the book and discovered they were close enough to make me feel as though I were anything but a dummy!"
4,Serious Adventures,"A selection of articles by award winning outdoors writer, who has been walking for 50 years, about his world-wide mounteering experiences. He enthuses over a lifetime in wild remote mountain country, taking us from the Yukon and the Wind River mountains (Wyomings premier backpacking area- 600 miles of trail) to the Alps, Caucasus and Himalyas. But he is particularly inspired by the islands and highlands of Scotland. Great photos. He has also written books Big-, Wild-, Classic-, and Challenging- walks, about walking in Britain."
5,Screen door grill review,"The actual measurements are 24 5/8"" by 25 3/4"" without the tabs, and the tabs are 4 1/2 "". These can be trimmed off if necessary. Used this for a travel trailer door, and it just fit by putting the tabs up and down, instead of sideways. Would recommend it for rv use, but measure you door before ordering. The price is very reasonable."
2,Let down,"While I like Ella's works, this album was a let down on my system. There is way to much background recording noise which interfers with the music. It sounds like they recorded this with an old phono record to speakers to mic. Look elsewhere for better recordings."
4,Great tool and great design !,"It's amazing that no one else thought of the portable spindle sander idea before this. I find myself turning to this tool more and more. I've used it to clean and straighten plywood edges using the included straight edge - it does a terrific job. I've also used it to trim fit an already hung Mahogany door. Yes, I could have used a planer, but this tool made easy work of sanding down the high spots. I'll be doing some curved work soon and I'm not dreading the post jigsaw cleanup - this will make easy work of that as well. I'm giving this four stars because the spindle set was not included with my purchase - this should be made part of the package."
4,Good sander,"The is a well built sander. The portability makes it easy to use on large pieces. The one thing that I would recommend is to have a handle. This sander is somewhat bulky and a handle would make it more ergonomic. If a handle were to be added, I would rate it five stars."
5,I prefer this to a benchtop or cabinet spindle sander,"If you want to use it like a benchtop spindle sander for small pieces, turn it upside down and clamp it to a couple of sawhorses."
5,Great sander,"This is a great idea for anyone with limited space or not.I rate the tool as sold. Yes it should have a case and yes it should come with all the different drums. Get over it because they are not included.The tool is very easy to use and the vacuum attachment works great.One thing I would like to see porter cable make the router table plates for other router table tops.Update: Benchdog did carry a router table plate so I could mount the sander in my router table. I also found it is much easier and cheaper to buy the 9"" sanding tubes and cut them in half."
1,Duck Alarm - Calling all Ducks...,"This mark/brand does not work at all, no matter what we do. Do not waste your money on this, save yourself the grief. It just sounds like a whistle."
2,HKS Magazine Speed Loader,"I think this would be a great product. If you could get one that fits the mag you are wanting to load. I have ordered two of these and purchased one from a sporting good store. None have worked. I want to load a 40 Cal Smith and Wesson Model 99 (8 round mag) and a 40 Cal Styer (12 round mag). I followed the makers recommendations (for size and fit as printed on the back of the prduct card) with all of the loaders. The mag is either too big or too small. They will not seat in the loader so that you can hold them and load them, one does not even fit the loader. Unless the maker is going to make one that fits these mags I am still loading by hand. So far this prodcut for me has been a waste of time and money."
5,If you have weak hands you need this!,I have weak hands and loading ammo is a struggle. Using this devise is wonderful. I can load quickly and get to target practice very quickly. Great gadget!
1,Does not fit a .40 Caliber S&W,"Product says it can fit any large caliber, but it will not fit my S&w .40 cal VE. It won't allow me to return the product so when I purchase my 9mm hopefully It will fit that."
2,Does not fit!!,"I own a Springfield XD 40 and figured based on the description that this loader would work. After opening it, reading the directions, I gave it a shot and no luck. The magazine is too fat and does not get close to fitting."
5,Magazine clip loader,This loader works great. It's a great thumb saver. My Sig magazine single stack fits perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Great Service!,"Great product and great price, and even better! Very fast service! I have used speedloader several times and works Great!"
1,Not for baretta 45,"Simple. I have a Stoeger Cougar 45. IT is the same as the Baretta 45. My Baretta 45 clips fit the Stoeger. The clips do not fit into this speed loader. THe loader is too narrow, so be wary of buying this. My Baretta 40 96 clips are also too wide to fit this loader, way too narrow. IT is adjustable length wise, but will not widen. Makes me wonder what it does fit??THis is advertized as a 45 caliber speed loader, and it clearly fits neither of my guns."
3,Does not work with Sig SP2340,Am sure it works if I got to use it but it does not fit my Sig (SW40). Watched a few YouTube videos which shows that its easy to use etc but the plastic seems flimsy so I think it will not last very long.
4,GREAT TEXTBOOK,"THE TEXTBOOK IS AS GOOD AS ANY I HAVE SEEN. KNOW YOUR CALCULUS IF YOU USE THE BOOK FOR SELF STUDY.FOR WHAT PROBLEMS DOES THE SOLUTIONS MANUAL GIVE SOLUTIONS?ALL OR SOME OF THE ODD, OR EVEN, OR SELECTED FROM ODD AND EVEN?"
3,physics for scientists and engineers,the book is ok but amazon suggested the wrong solutions manuel and I can't seem to get an answer on if you carry the correct book or not? disappointed with amazon with this issue.
1,Not what I expected,"I was really excited to find this portfolio, until I received it in the mail. The quality of the item is fine, but the dimensions don't match what the description says. The description says that it is 17.5"" x 11.5"". It is in fact 16 7/8"" x 11.5"". So, my 11 x 17 paper will not fit inside the portfolio at all. It's not worth the time and money to send it back, so now I'm stuck with something useless. I will not be recommending this product to anyone, ever."
5,Simple portfolio - just what I had been looking for!,"I'd been seeking a simple, under-arm portfolio for several years and, finally found one on Amazon. Interesting sidebar -- I tried ordering this portfolio from another source previously, but due to what I can only assume was a shipping problem with UPS, I never received it - despite a confirming email from the retailer that (based on a confirmation from UPS) it had been delivered to my home. I notified the retailer of the problem, and a track was launched, but after a month, I wasn't optimistic that there would be any positive results. I promptly did another online search, found the same product on Amazon, and ordered it, asking that it be shipped to my office. It arrived in less than a week. Thanks, Amazon!"
4,Cowboys of the Southwest,"AN IRRESISTIBLE WOMANShe was the youngest Donovan sister. An innocent beauty whose sweet, trusting nature had once opened her heart to hurt.AN UNTAMEABLE MANHe was a loner. A man more comfortable around horses than people. A wrangler with a gift for taming even the most savage stallion on the Donovan ranch.A FATEFUL WEDDINGWhen Jessica Donovan came face-to-face with Dan Black, her every feminine instinct told her the rugged ranch hand was the man who could heal her wounded heart and make her homecoming complete. But first she had to show the brooding cowboy the soothing strength of a woman's touch and prove that she was indeed his destiny."
5,Extra Benefit,Bought this for arthritis and got the extra bonus for my restless legs. I no longer use restless leg mess due to this wonderful product. It's safer and it takes care of the pain.
5,Very Happy with Natures way Spirulina,"This is one of the supplements I've been taking every day for over a year. This particular brand seems just as effective as other brands I have taken, and the price is average. It's conveinient to be able to order most of my supplements from one place, get quality,save money, and free shipping, makes for a winning purchase for me."
2,haven't noticed anything special,Been taking this for the reported energy boost for weeks now. Haven't noticed anything special. I will finish the bottle. If I turn into superwoman I will report back. Have hope.
2,It's just okay,Can't say this did anything for me. The price was right for me to try it out in my health regime but in the end I didn't notice any changes in my health. Not something I'd be buying again until it has some effect on my lifestyle that I can see and feel.
1,Steel train is the worst band in the world.,"I give it one star because there is no choice for zero. I saw them live with finch, from autumn to ashes, and fivespeed. If you want a good album. Check out Fivespeed:Trade in your Halo. Steel Train brought the entire mood of the audience down. The guitar player actually apologized for having one more song to go at the end of their set. The ""lead singer"" couldnt even be heard(nobody was cheering). The only talent that was shown was from the two guitarists. My advice to them...quit and start something new."
1,The picture is of a brown knife. The knife itself is yellow (amber).,"Read the item description very carefully and don't be fooled by the picture. This item is a very light yellow Case knife labeled by Case as 'amber', described by Ace Hardware here as 'chestnut'. The picture they provide is of a dark, reddish brown knife.When I discovered this error for them, I was sent a return authorization where I pay for the return shipping cost. With tracking, this is roughly 1/4 the cost of the knife itself. The item picture has not been updated so I guess they don't really care if you receive the item you expect or not."
3,A hot sleeper album,"I saw this album in the Sister 2 Sister Magazine, and it said it was a hit. Indeed it is. Jazzy, blues, R&B, everything a true music lover needs. He has a great sound, kind of a male tracy chapman. I loved it, you will too. Also check out Kem, album is Kemistry. Saw his album when looking up this one. Thanks Mul-ty for the great music. I'm gonna definitely pass the word around."
5,sarah has done it again,"I have read Sarah's Simple Abundance each year since it came out. Now I find this wonderful book of hers too. I am so glad she chose to refer to God more in this new book. I love Sarah's ability to write as we live. She knows what it is to truly see, hear, listen, touch, and smell our lives. Please don't just glance at your child, look into your child. Don't just see a flower, see the Creator who made it bloom. And as the seasons in life and nature change, we too change and grow. We cannot do it alone. Live your life, every moment, every breath.thank you Sarah."
5,Go Sarah!!!,"Romancing the Ordinary is a continuation of Sarah's (and our) quest for happiness and joy in this short time that we have on planet Earth. Although I have read, and re-read, all of her books, I am never tired of what she has to say. I don't care if she says ""toots,"" talks about her divorce or daughter, or reiterates a point that she made in a previous book. To me, the bottom line is, Sarah touches my heart. I think that most women who are on the ""simple abundance"" path will find great pleasure in Romancing the Ordinary. It is truly an ""essensual"" book from cover to cover."
5,An Inspirational Read,"Sarah Ban Breathnach has been one of my favourite authors for a while now. I picked up Simple Abundance a couple of years ago, and it came to me just at the right time. I eagerly followed up on Sarah's work with The Simple Abundance Companion and Something More, but I found Romancing The Ordinary to be her best work yet. The book is a light and inspiring read, and like your best friend, Sarah encourages you to come in a little closer and share in some ""secret women's business"". And almost everything she suggests - from creating a Holiday Memory Book, to mixing your own bath salts - are easy, fun-filled ideas to help you find beauty in the ordinary.I loved this book so much that almost every third page has been highlighted with quotes and ideas that have inspired me. And I would encourage any reader, who is looking to bring a bit of romance back into the every day, to pick up a copy of this gorgeous book.Zara StevensBoy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"
3,Stick with Simple Abundance,"Despite a few annoying affectations, Simple Abundance is a classic due to the fact that it really captures the joys and frustrations of the busy contemporary woman's life in all its nuances. I spent a couple of hours reading Romancing the Ordinary in a Borders a few days ago, and decided not to buy it. It's boring, to be blunt, and I was expecting more of a simple ""to do"" book to awaken the senses. Parts are downright pretentious. I really feel no need to own or read this book; I will continue to re-read passages from Simple Abundance for many years to come. I find it sad when talented nonfiction writers re-write the same book over and over again (think Natalie Goldberg, Julia Cameron). They should take a page from Anne Lamott and take some risks!"
3,TOO MUCH GOD FOR ME,I bought several sets of tapes for my family gift giving but when I played one I decided to put them in the charity box instead. Far too much religion in it. Self improvement and joy of living does not HAVE to be god related. I am sorry because I really do think she has great talent. If she could just write and leave religion out of it.
1,Romancing the Ordinary,"I was very disappointed after buying and reading Sarah's other books and receiving Romancing the Ordinary. The quality of the book (paper, etc.) is poor. I expected more after buying her other books which were beautifully done. I am returning this book."
4,Decent deal,"I've had experience with the Dewalt 18 volt quad pack and some cordless Bosch products. Some noteworthy differences: the Porter Cable reciprocating saw has a quick change blade but unlike the convenient Dewalt lever, the rotating lock is only accessible with the stroke extended. This means you have to play with the trigger until saw stops in the right position before you can change your blade. The Bosch cordless drill has a cool auto lock deal that lets you loosen or tighten the chuck one handed. Porter Cable's and Dewalt's do not. Porter Cable's circular saw is nice and quite but with no noticeable power increase over Dewalt's 18 volt equivalent. The rest of the Porter Cable package seems to have plenty of power."
3,Some problems.,"I bought this kit. I used the tiger saw for 5 min. and the bearing broke. I just took it apart and found that one of the screw retainers was missing causing the bearing to shatter. ( I will post the results when I get it fixed...no parts list so I think I will have to send the whole thing back)I find the circ. saw very good but the finish blade I needed is really over priced and took a long, long time to arrive. I feel the flashlight is not needed in this kit. I, (as everyone else I think),feel that it is really cheap not to include another battery at this price. (If you are useing two tools you have nothing charging or to carry with you as a spare.) The drill is very good. (I would not want to use it for anything but hammer drilling...Too heavy. Very good at hammer drilling and for large wood bits.)"
5,Very Pleased!,"I bought the drill/driver 5 years ago. Added the circular saw a couple of years later. I have been running them both on the drills original battery packs (2) and they are still working well. What i have learned over the years with re-chargables, is that NEVER leave them in the charger ""trickle"" charging. I run them all the way down, charge them, then remove them immedialty. I know that the instructions say that you can leave them charging indefinatly, but i learned the hard way on Streamlight flashlight batterys.....leaving them on trickle kills them in about 6 months. I just bought a used Hammer drill that came with the newer 2.4 amp batterys and plan on picking up the Tigersaw and Jig. Cordless is the only way to fly.RD"
3,powerful but the batteries and charger are constant expense,"General contractor from california, I have had the PC 19.2 kit for 3 years, the tools have fallen from ladders and been beaten badly and they still work great when the batteries want to work , i ve been through three chargers ... Yeah I am thinking that my next kit will be a BOSCH. PC makes a good tool but youd think they would get the battery and charger thing together. All I can say is thank GOD uncle sam allows tools for a business expense,"
1,HORRIBLE MERCHANDISE RECEIVED,"I ordered this product for my husband for Christmas. Luckily, for us, he needed something out of it this weekend so I gave him his gift early. Now, mind you, I paid $500.00 for something that I believed to be NEW! I opened the shipping box and the box the tools came in and the box was broken. That was just the beginning. When we opened the box, the tools were clearly used. There was sawdust on the saw, there was rust on the screws on the batteries, there were goudges and scuff marks on the tools. I would not recommend this to anyone! Normally I have good experiences when dealing with Amazon and had it been disclosed prior to purchase, I would have never purchased something that was used for that much when I can go to Home Depot and buy something new for the same amount of money!"
4,Good course book for beginner/intermediate,"It reminded me of Adobe's 'classroom in a book' books. The lessons are well thought out and advance the reader from basic concepts to intermediate, and some advanced concepts. I liked this book over a lot of reference-type books in that it forced me to press the buttons and understand the concepts by doing them (""Learning by doing"" -quote from back cover of book)There was a chapter on HTML which isn't a prerequiste for learning dreamweaver, but useful. There's also chapters on javascript behaviours, layout, typography, and using GeoCity to put a website online. The book is a decent reference, although its strength is in its tutorials, and as reference it is unable to cover all of Dreamweaver's features. It also only covers the standard version of Dreamweaver, and not UltraDev. Overall, the book is a good purchase if you need to learn dreamweaver 4 and plan to actually read it through."
2,Easy and not comprehensive,"I recently bought Dreamweaver, it's an...interesting program, but I'm not here to review the program specifically. This book is comprehensive (mostly) and reviews most of the capabilities of Dreamweaver, but only tangentially. The CD is good, but the examples are bad, and the coverage is suspect. The author also has a bad web site.Better stick with the manuals that come with the program."
4,Great captures in book.,"This book is great. I bought the Macromedia book for Dreamweaver and sent it back because it advertised as being a book for learning Dreamweaver4 and Fireworks. The book turned out to be only for Fireworks. This curent book has a lot of information and great screen captures. It also includes a CD that has Trial copies of Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Netscape and Internet Explorer. Enjoy"
1,This Book with CD does not work on MS Windows XP,"It is very disappointing that this is not ""noticed"" in the Amazon.com advertisement for this Book and included CD. A waste of time and effort. I need this for a college class but apparently it was developed to work on an older version of MS Windows... and not XP.I called Peachpit Press (publisher) and they have not returned my call."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I expected a lot more from Lynda. Her previous book was wonderful, but this book is basically just a repeat of DW4 HOT. There is only 15-20% new info. Even the exercises are the same. They just copied the old book into the new with minor changes, they didn't even spend time making new exercises. To pay that much money for a copy of the old book is just plain and simpy ridiculous, there are a lot more books that authors have spent more time writing and making new examples like DW4 Magic and Inside DW4. Consider them and leave this one behind. Sorry Lynda I expected more from you, and now I will think twice buying any of your books. I bought this book blind, just because the authors were Lynda Weinman and Garo Green."
2,not sure if it makes a difference,My wife's doctor recommended this product even though everythig was normal in my case. I used it for 6 months. My wife got pregnant with infertility treatments several months after I stopped using this product. This product did not make any difference in our case.
2,For My People Download,"The music is excellent, all you would expect from Brooke Medicine Eagle. The download, however, leaves a lot to be desired; lots of squeaks, chirps and skips in the music and at the end of several songs, after a pause, the last few seconds of the song is repeated. I recommend the album, but better buy the cd, the download is of shakey quality."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This DVD was poorly made and edited. It starts out with old cartoons that have no educational value at all. The box came damaged, the graphics are of poor quality and the animal sounds at the begining are quite annoying. DOn't waste your money on this one...instead purchase some real finger puppets and do the fingerplays on your own...your money will be put to better use. My chilren were not entertained by this at all, other than listening to Lori's annoying sounds and laughing at them. I wish I had my 15 bucks back on this one....."
2,Know what you are getting...,"In case your one of the 96% who never really looks at the ""size"" of a book when you order it, make sure you do for this one. It's only a pocket version of Lady Gregory's book, and, although the website does not tell you so, this is an ABRIGDED version.Just know what you're getting."
1,Not the edition you're looking for,"This edition offers only a small selection of Lady Gregory's _Gods and Fighting Men_, plus the book itself is about 2"" by 4"". In other words, this book is really a souvenir--not a text to be read. You probably want to get the full text of _Gods and Fighting Men_ instead."
1,Really Really Small,I was incredibly surprised and disappointed when I received this book in the mail. I had ordered it for my wife's birthday and couldn't believe how small it was. I wish I had had some warning. She finished reading it in about 10 minutes.
1,This is a tiny little 1 inch book.,FYI...this book is about an inch and a half square. This is like a keychain size book. You can't really tell that from the picture.
1,Irish myths,This very tiny book is very disappointing. I was expecting Lady Gregory's classic book of myths--a tome of a couple hundred pages. This little edition might be nice for a young child but was not what I wanted to introduce my niece to her classic heritage.
2,Irish Myths and Legends,THIS BOOK IS A MINI BOOK!!!IT IS ABOUT TWO INCHES BY TWO INCHES.ANYONE THAT READS IT MUST HAVE VERY GOOD EYESIGHT!!!I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
1,Poor design,"This kite never even flew. It went up... came down... and one of the plastic poles popped out into oblivion, never to be found again. It doesn't seem to be designed well for flying."
5,Great Resource,This gives first hand accounts of how the depression affected the common man and how much faith and thrust they put into the office presidency. Every teacher should have one of these in their classroom.
5,All too familiar,I could only read this in small sips or I'd never get out of my emotional shock.The Shock? Each of these letters are mirrored in the Letters to the Editors of my local paper.From the despair of the working (or unemployed) poor to the blame the victim letters.Increased the size of my food garden beds as the remedy of the truth facing us now.
3,An interesting idea but the vocals take away from the experience,"I was really excited about this concept at first and I think it is still a worthy pursuit, as the hang drum has much to offer and the flamenco mix is such a creative and exciting idea.. however I found the female vocals to be a little over the top and overbearing.. maybe just not my style of flamenco singing but honestly I thought it just could be a better singer! In the end I enjoy the instrumental hang drum pieces."
1,These are complete garbage,"I've had this for less than a year. Used it pretty gingerly for a metronome. I mean, how much wear can occur in a pretty basic pendulum mechanism? Yesterday, tried to get it going so I could do some bass exercises. Nada. The pendulum does not go back and forth anymore. The really sad thing is I'm looking at the price I apparently paid for this, and I can't believe that for that price this has turned out to be such a complete piece of garbage."
5,Great buy,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loved it. Turned out it is the exact same Metronome his piano teacher has. The model I got does not have a bell, which I understand is better for beginners. It looks really pretty sitting on top of the piano too!"
2,Product workmanship was poor,"When I ordered this product, I knew it was an expensive purchase but was willing to pay the high price for a product of superior workmanship and materials. When I recedived the product, it was made of a thin piece of wood vaneer with plastic in the center. I was shocked, it was cheaply made and not worth anywhere near the price I paid for it. I expected a Seth Thomas type product but this was not the case at all. I was highly disappointed. I returned the product for a refund. I would not recommend this product at all."
5,Great Metronome!,I love this metronome. It is easy to use and looks fabulous on the piano. The sound is much better than the electric metronomes. Quality construction - I think it will last for many years to come.
4,Great Addition,"Purchased for kids learning piano and guitar. Great addition to any home of the musically inclined. Very happy with the look and mahogany finish. Our piano teacher has had one for nearly 40 years and it looks exactly the same and is still working perfectly. However, I noticed the one we purchased has some plastic components where the older ones have metal. I was a little disappointed by this but grateful it was Made in Germany as we try to buy products Made in the US or Europe. Thankfully they have not outsourced this to China. This model has the bell, definitely worth the difference in price."
1,Not as advertised,Although the software is pretty good. It came with neither the Christian Greeting Card software of the Jerusalem Photo Tour as advertised on the box.
2,"FROM THE ROCKFISH GRILL; ANACORTES, WA","...Stuart's latest CD is a pleasing blend of blues and country music that is quickly getting heard across the country, from Florida to Seattle and all down the West Coast. Alice Stuart has got a unique way of treating a melody, and she knows a good song when she hears one. Although Stuart is a fine songwriter, her interpretation of other people's songs makes you feel like you're hearing the song for the first time. Listen for her exceptional versions of Chris Wall's ""I Feel Like Hank Williams Tonight"" or Bob Dylan's ""One Too Many Mornings.""Not often does an artist both entertain and inspire. Alice Stuart does both with style, finesse and a great sense of humor."
1,NOT Acoustic Alchemy,"One thing that all previous reviewers have failed to hit on, or remember, notice or know is this album is NOT Acoustic Alchemy playing. At best it is HALF of AA. Sadly the other half died of cancer several years ago and by the way, they never were a ""Band"" as I would ever use the word. Two Extremely tallented guys with guitars that made awesome music which can now only be imitated by another player......and an ELECTRIC GUITAR ??? I love the Instrument, but for ... ""ACOUSTIC"" Alchemy ??, the duo who got their start playing to passengers on the Concord ??? An ELECTRIC Guitar ??? What is Next ?? Bongos ?? Thank God I have all of their original works on CD already. If you want to listen, fine, but don't compare the two, Apples & ... Well Electric Oranges."
2,sounds of unrealized potential,"Sounds of St Lucia?!?!?! The only thing that made me think of St. Lucia on this C.D. is that it was physically recorded there. If you're looking for overlapping accoustic guitar harmonies that feel like swaying palms, white sand beneath your feet, and a clean, aqua blue sea, look somewhere else! I would entitle this collection, 'songs that start out sounding like a caribbean island but end up sounding like hair band tryouts'. For most of these songs, it's as if some one hit the 'scream switch' midway, and turned beauty into beast. I like AA because of the beautiful music I've heard (usually 50% of each CD), but they just kill me with the 'scream switch' crap. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.I enjoyed 'the Beautiful Game', the Wind of Change', and 'Augustrasse'. The rest varied from disappointing to ""w.t.f.?!""-MB"
1,Too expensive!,"I would give this book 5 starts, becausae it is written by such a well-known and eminient Islamic scholar. However, the price is such a deterrant, no-one but financial institutions will read it. This is a complaint against many Islamic authors - they rip you off with the extortionate prices of their books. What happend to the Quranic injunction to spread knowledge??"
2,No Response 16!,"Be very wary when purchasing this telescope. Although the optics on a Mak are excellent, the mount is terrible.1. The dovetail mounting does not clamp securely.2. The electronics are abysmally made, e.g. The wiring and circuit boards constantly short.3. The Goto operation puts you a few degrees off of what you are searching for, I directly can see M31, but when it automatically slews to it, the image is nowhere near the fov.4. The mount has been sent to Celestron for repairs, twice. Gone for three months, only to short out after one use when returned.5. The electronics in the red dot finder failed after less than a year.6. CAVEAT EMPTOR! When purchasing this telescope."
4,star lover,I upgraded to this telescope after working with a $45.00 second hand bushnell telescope and a really great pair of Skymaster 20 x 80 binoculars from celestron. So far I really like it but am having trouble with the sky align. It keeps failing. I live in the country in northern MN and don't have any trouble with clear vision of the night sky. My only complaint is the instructions are somewhat incomplete and don't have a trouble shooting section. The telescope and tripod are very nice quality. I'd recommend this product to someone perhaps not as green as myself....
5,My Gift to myself this year!,"I have not used it yet, but I already love it, especially with the ability to connect to my ipad/iphone makes it even sweeter."
5,Great series - My child absolutely loves them,"My four year old daughter loves this series. Like most four year old girls, she can be very picky (about everything!) and this is her hands down favorite things to watch. While being very entertaining (some of the Baby and Little Einstein people are the creative forces behind this), this is also a great educational experience. Our daughter has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended."
2,Warning - For Windows: XP or 2000 Only,"My Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 (non-tilt scroll wheel) mouse failed after less than one year's use. Don't bother to look for any warranty info on these products. I figured I'd look for the newest and best so I bought this one. As another user said, this is the 4.0 Intellimouse -- says so on the bottom of the mouse. Warning - the software will not install on Windows 98SE! This mouse works with my old Intellimouse software but NOT the tilt wheel and the scroll wheel is now sloppy and irritating to use. (Well, what do you expect -- it's not made for this OS.) This mouse looks more compact but both Intellimice are too large for my thumb to comfortably reach the small thumb button. What can I say? I'm looking for a different brand of mouse."
5,Have both wired and wireless. The BEST scroll wheel.,"Always liked MS mice for their effortless clicking switches. I do not think I ever had one fail... The scroll wheel on this mouse is what brings it to a 5. The scroll is silky smooth and without annoying clicks.The side buttons work fine with practice. I never bother with the tilt function as it is too hard to switch and rarely a time saver.The mouse wheel switch is about the same as the old versions.The wireless is the exact same shape as the wired. It is heavier of course with the batteries. What I do not like is that in order for me to scroll occasionally, I need to wiggle the mouse to ""wake it up"". This wake up process is quick but necessary even after the most brief of pauses.To recap, fine mouse with superior click switches on the buttons and a fantastic scroll wheel."
2,Another Customer With Left Click Problems,"Like many others, my left click also stopped working after about 10-11 months. I agree with others that this is a great mouse - comfortable, the scroll works really well, the optical tracking is great. However, it is surprising that Microsoft put out a product that wasn't even tested for the most basic of durability functions."
4,Intellimouse with OSX Panther,"I wanted this mouse because I wanted more buttons and a tilt wheel. The mouse is really solid (if a little larger than I expected), but the software is a little convoluted. I was hoping that the tilt wheel would be good for scrolling sideways, and it does work fine on most applications. Finder yes, Firefox no, Illustrator yes. Itunes yes.The software assigning the keys is quirky. If I want to set the wheel button to activate Expose, I have to set the button in the ms software to secondary click and in the osx prefs set expose to active on the right mouse button. Very odd.But at 16 dollars including shipping it is a real deal, and once you have figured out the software quirks it is great.Hopefully the Tiger mouse control panel will be smarter and then I won't need the ms software."
5,Unbelievable mouse! Worth every penny,"This is my second Intellimouse Explorer 4.0 and I wouldn't have gotten it again if it wasn't a great mouse. It's solid and comfortable; decent size, but probably not for people with dainty hands.I can't remember when I bought my first one, but it was at least Fall 2006. About six months ago, I noticed not every click was registering and I would have to click harder or more deliberate sometimes. So it was time for a replacement. And I've read other people's complaints, but I put it through 4 years of a solid workout. For ~$30? Worth every penny.My biggest regret is not buying two this time around. I just hope it's still available in 4 years.I hope this helps."
3,"Great for 18 months, stops right clicking",This is actually the 2nd one of these I've had. It's an amazing feel and worked excellent for about 18 months. A few weeks ago it started to have difficulty right clicking. Now I have to click like 5 times before it registers.
3,MS Intellimouse-wired,"I bought this after I had a similar MS WIRELESS product because there would be times when the cursor froze up and I attributed this to the wireless nature of the device. This WIRED intellimouse does the same thing, maybe not quite as often but still, often enough to be a nuisance. Can't attribute the temporary freezing up of the cursor to interference in the wireless communication because this IS WIRED. This must be a bug somewhere else in the system."
1,Was nice while it lasted,Like the other reviewer said the left click is near death after about a year of regular use... which is why I'm looking around for a new one. :-(
2,Left-Click Button No Longer Works,"I must agree with an earlier reviewer. Ergonomically this is the best mouse i've ever used, and i too am a ""mouse snob"" -- But unfortunately, after less than a year of use, the left click button no longer responds. For the premium microsoft is charging, that is unacceptable."
3,A decent mouse choice and the price was right.,"This mouse is Microsoft's Intellimouse 4.0. As an optical mouse, its movement and weight are excellent. I replaced a broken Intellimouse 3.0 with this and even though this mouse seems favor a right-handed user (I am lefty) even more than version 3.0, it fits more comfortably into my hand than the V3.0.The two things I do not like about the mouse are that the two side button are rather small and set too far up on the left side and the ""tilt wheel"" only seems to work in Internet Explorer and Netscape...does not work in Opera, Office XP or Photoshop.All in all, I like the mouse and I liked the price with the free shipping. I compared prices with stores like CompUSA and BestBuys and Amazon was substantially cheaper."
1,"Nice mouse design, bad reliability","I purchased this mouse about 2 years ago. After 9 months, the left mouse button stopped working. The only way to get it to work was press especially hard, and even then it didn't work. I went to Microsoft, and got another mouse sent to me for free after a week or so.Now on my second mouse, I'm having the same problems again. I'm waiting for my 3rd mouse to come in the mail. The design on this mouse is excellent, and I love the scroll wheel among other features. But because of the reliability concerns about the left mouse button (in especially short periods of time, too!), I would highly recommend NOT buying this mouse. Get a more reliable one and save yourself this hassle."
2,"Great Design, Poor Quality","I wish I had read the other reviews here! After just a month or so of using the mouse, the left-click is done for! Like other reviewers have said, the left button has to be pushed with a lot of force to get it to work. I really like the design of the mouse; the way it fits my hand, the side buttons and everything, it's just not built to a decent quality standard."
2,Useless scroll wheel sinks otherwise nice mouse,"The scroll wheel in this mouse is simply no good. It looks like a failed experiment in which, unfortunately, everyone who bought this mouse has taken part. You can try to spin the mushy-feeling wheel as fast as you like, but it will only result in a couple of jerkily scrolled lines. It's actually more convenient to put the pointer on the scroll bar and drag, or just reach for the keyboard.It's a shame too, because it tracks nicely and has nice-feeling buttons. But so do other mice that have working scroll wheels."
3,problems with USB mouseport adapter,"Have had the mouse for a week:Pros: Looks cool. Nice feel to it when using it. Matches my black/chrome keyboard.Cons: The responsiveness of the scroll wheel stinks using the adapter and horizontal scroll refuses to work at all when using the USB to mouseport adapter. It does work better when using the USB alone.Bottom line: Decent mouse. Classic Microsoft, put out a product before all bugs are out of it!!"
2,Craps out,"This would have been a nice mouse if it continued to work properly. It worked fine for me for a little under a year and the click problem happened with me as well. I've owned 2 intellimouse mice, and both have died out on me. I've learned my lesson and purchased a logitech mouse, which has been working wonderfully.Also, if you intend to play a lot of PC games, the smooth scroll wheel isn't the best option. Get a click wheel with your mouse if you're serious about playing games that rely on the wheel."
2,"Gamers, avoid this mouse!","I miss my 3.0Where the side buttons used to be easily clickable without moving your hand, the newer 4.0 makes it difficult to click and control the mouse at the same time. This is not a mouse for gamers.Another major problem is the wheel button. This is a major function button for me in many games. Now it responds 1 out of 3 times (if that!). I click and click... and nothing happens."
1,L-button stopped working,"Like another reviewer, the mouse worked fine for about a month, then the L-click button stopped working. Now I have to click on items about seven times before they are recognized. I would have given this five stars if my expectation was to have the mouse work for 30 days, but seeing that my expectation was for it to work for years, it gets only one star."
2,"Great feel, short lifespan","The mouse feels great in my hand, but after 8 months of normal business use, the left-click has pretty much died. If I pound on the button hard enough, it might click 2 out of 5 times. For the amount of money spent on this mouse, I'd have to say that it's not really worth it.I now have remapped the smaller thumb button to click, until my new mouse arrives."
1,Just plain bad,"This is easily the worst mouse I've ever had. The tracking is very lazy. My old Logitech mechanical mouse tracks better.The worst problem is the scroll wheel. The wheel has a delayed action. It waits till you are typing then whiz! The page scrolls away. I'm not even touching the stupid mouse when it starts scrolling.I noticed people complaining about the sticky scroll wheel. I vivisected this POS to see why. It is simply a bad design. there is no space between the wheel and the housing inside the mouse. Dust and dirt collects off the wheel quickly gums up the works. You could clean it, but it's not worth the effort."
2,Also having problem with Left-Click premature wear,"NO LESS THAN 7 REVIEWERS HERE ALL HAVING THE SAME LEFT-CLICK PROBLEM IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS!!I am having the same exact problem as Reviewer Peter M. Yocum ""some dude""QUOTING PETER: ""The switch under the normal button (left button) is unreliable, and apparently this is a known problem with late models of the Intellimouse.""This is true in my case - my mouse worked wonderfully for about 6 months, and now the annoyance has begun - same as many others have experienced.Like Peter said - the scroll wheel is great, the tracking is smooth, the extra buttons are fine, it's comfortable and looks great.And like Peter said - since the primary function is that left click button, having it malfunctioning ruins it.I also recommend you search online for ""intellimouse click problems"" before you buy, and decide for yourself."
2,Broken record: great mouse except for left button,"I like everything about this mouse, except the left mouse button, which wore out after about 8 months, and is now flaky and intermittent.Where is responsibility? Where is liability? Microsoft ain't gonna replace it.This will be my last Microsoft mouse. Logitech's always been good to me and they will get my future mouse business. Or maybe an Apple Mighty Mouse. That's a great accessory."
1,Worst Mouse I've Ever Owned.,"I was attracted to Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer because of it's advertised versatility (all those buttons AND a tilt wheel). Well, after less than a year the left mouse button - the primary ""clicker"" - went bad. I've never had a mouse fail so quickly and so thoroughly. I had expected a higher quality product from Microsoft."
1,"Horrible Mouse, Horrible Support","After using this mouse very lightly and gently for 2 months, the left mouse button stopped working about half of the time. I called Microsoft Customer Support this morning and they said that could not help me. So, now I'm stuck with a $40 mouse that doesn't work.Don't get me wrong, this is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used. But, when all is said and done, it cost me about $0.75 per day of use, which is much too expensive for any mouse."
1,Scroll wheel problems,"The scroll wheel doesn't work properly on this mouse, and I've seen other reviews with the same problem. I use this mouse for graphics applications and am constantly using the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. It has some kind of weird delay..sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. A huge and frustrating impediment to productivity. I'm replacing it with something else."
2,Side buttons leave something to be desired,"Although this is a solid 2 button mouse, the main impetus for me to get it was the 2 side thumb buttons. Unfortunately unlike the original intellimouse explorer the buttons are very small and hard to hit for me. It is not very ergonomic to hit them frequently.As far as tracking, I have not seen any issues with normal business oriented use and the surfaces around."
1,"Beware, worst mouse ever","I unplugged this mouse after about an hour & went back to my old one for these reasons:1) I hate the smooth scrolling wheel & it's very stiff to scroll like something's dragging.2) Due the the tilt wheel function the L & R buttons are too far apart & require way too much finger movement if you use your index finger to click both buttons.3) The wheel button is hard to click, takes a lot of force.4) The tilt wheel is hard to actuate & didn't work in any applications I tried.5) Worst of all, the scroll wheel does not work if the cursor is moving at all. You have to make sure the mouse is perfectly still to scroll.Buying a mouse is like buying a pair of shoes ... you need to ""try it on"" before buying. I will never buy a mouse blindly again. This thing is garbage, MS should be ashamed."
3,"fits palm well, but wheel feels kind of weak","this mouse fits the palm quite well... like the old style intellimouse 1.3A or 3.0. however, i don't like the fishy feel of the wheel because it doesn't click when you scroll the wheel.i hope MS can make those intellimouse 1.3A (Black one for Dell) or the Intellimouse 3.0 (white) again. the white / off-white color may be out of fashion. so how about the old mouse with new color?"
2,Pass it by,"I love a great scottish romance!! Too bad this can't classify as one. I actually liked Anora-she does what she can in a man's world to help her people and save her land. Our hero, Ramsay, however-blah. He was really irritating and he spent half of the book injured. I would have liked to see more of the brothers and parents in parents in it, too. They were much more interesting characters. And the evil character starts out that way but at the end, you're not sure if he still is. And there are a couple of questions left over at the end-how did Ramsay's brothers find them and who was the warrior? It just seemed the author wasn't paying that much attention to the plot."
5,Excellent,"I have the entire set by Dr. Yang and it is required viewing if your serious about learning Chi-Kung. I have read a lot of books on this subject, but this set, which is very well done clears up a lot of loose ends and one really understands the energy systems much clearer."
5,The best resource!,"There are no other sources like those from Dr. Yang.I teach Qigong and Taiji and I have many of Dr.Yangs books which I recommend highly. The books are often a little difficult to read but in these DVDs everything is clear, organized and sequential. Start with DVD 1 & 2 when you want more just keep going! Dr. Yang has so much knowledge it is quite amazing.When I started reading his books about 12 years ago I found him a little hard to get into. After watching 7 or 8 DVDs I find him kind of charming, in other words, he grows on you. After watching so much of his stuff, I feel like I actually know him as one of my teachers, even though I have never met him. All of his DVDs are like attending a personal workshop/seminar, and you can watch them over and over!The truth is, he knows this stuff inside and out, from scientific to spiritual. Another truism is this... No one else will give you as much information, period."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,"Author Black provides little interesting reading in Why I Stopped Listening to Rush : Confessions of a Recovering Neocon. His narrow, simplistic view of US government and culture is poorly supported in this book. His themes are repetitive and based on half-truths. He continually references the ""founding fathers"" and their seemingly homogeneous line of thinking.Additionally, this book should be offensive to any non-males, not of the Caucasian persuasion. On pages 41 - 44 he lists characteristics of a good American leader. Every stanza begins, ""He would be a man...""This is a poorly written, offensive book."
1,REFURBISHED hard-drive in a VERY LOW-QUALITY enclosure,"Be forewarned that this drive -- like all MDT products -- is REFURBISHED/RECERTIFIED (and NOT brand new). Moreover, based on my past experience with equipment sold by NARRO, his enclosures are VERY low quality; they tend to breakdown within a year, leaving you with an internal drive only (which, as mentioned earlier, is REFURBISHED to begin with!). While I have nothing against this particular seller (who is re-selling so-called ""new"" equipment that he/she purchased), I do advise buyers NOT to purchase products that were originally marketed by NARRO!"
3,Cheapo Drive- Cracker Jack surprise or russian roulette?,"1- This product is sold as new within VAIO external enclosures, (SURPRISE!) it is however REFURBISHED . Says so in their own poorly written web-site -MDTGlobal-2- Documentation is beyond sparse (a mini leaflet).3- Don't expect support- at all.4- Performance is OK.5- At least it didn't came DOA."
4,Great Service Low Low Price,I have read the reviews here and think that a couple of things should be put in perspective. I have had Packet 8 for nearly a year now and am very happy with the service. I have had problems with echos and bad connections but it was not Packet 8's problem it was my ISP who had upgraded a piece of equipment causing bandwidth problems. For an avg of $22 per month I am extremely happy with this service. If you want to compare horror stories for disconnection fees: SBC charged me $200 to cancel my broadband and phone service with them with a phone bill on avg of $153 per month...Packet 8 is bliss compared to being pummeled by those who think they have a monopoly.
1,DO NOT SIGN UP WITH PACKET 8,"I have been with Vonage for 2 years and Sun Rocket for 9 months. Recently I signed up with Packet 8. There website is pretty bad. If you change any features eg call forwarding or caller ID, nothing happens. Email notification does not carry voice mail. Some of the numbers can not be dialed with Packet 8. If you complain there is no response or no action. I am surprised that they are still in business."
5,Great device and Perfect Phone Service,"No problems at all.In 2 minutes I could setup and stated making calls.Cheap international rates too, especially to India.The sound quality is excellent."
1,"Big Rip Off .The Clarity was Pathetic ,Customer Service bad",If called from packet8 clarity was so so bad that the other person could not hear it .If called to Packet8 phone it was going going to Bellsouth customer who has the same phone number as the one packet 8 gave me.So Called the Customer Service they told that they can't do much about the clarity because I have a LAN Connection so called them to cancel my service and returned the equipment within 10 days they gave me cancellation number but forgot to note it down. After 3 months my credit card was billed I called them they told my phone service was never cancelled which was a big lie they told they will charge 59 dollars for not cancelling after the initial one month. I called customer service but they didn't help much .I think they just looting money from people for bad service and based on wrong reasons . I would never ever buy packet8 service or advice nobody unless they want to get ripped ofRip off Rip off -Rip Off -Rip Off -Rip off
1,"very unreliable, poor quality service","I have been using packet8 since Mid march over a Comcast Highspeed cable connection.I found it is a very poor quality service.1) Calls getting droped is very common2) Most of time I call some one , i had to try multiple times to get connected3) Lot of times , I had to drop the call and call other party from my cell phone because the other side couldnt hear any thing i speaktried to attend an interview on this line yesterday and it droped the call 3 times in 45 mins. Many times voice was getting interrupted and both party couldnt hear any thing.I got really frustrated and called them to cancel it today. Now they showing me a small section in ""terms & conditions"" saying i have a 12 months contract and need to pay $59 to disconnect! No where in the order page or during signup it displays this contract info. Very crooked bussiness practice.. stay away from packet 8Comcast internet connection is really good and stable. never had a problem with it.."
1,Worst customer service experience,"The service itself is a little below expectation. Esp whenmaking int'l calls, often broken up, or need to call coupletimes in order to connect. The customer service is reallybad. The CSR is so rude that I can't even finish describingthe issue. And when requested to talk to a supervisor, he'sbasically won't do it. After I insist and another long hold,only then able to talk to a not-so-helpful supervisor. And theyactually delete your account from their system when you cancelthe service. Now they need to charge mefor the disconnect fee, but since they have deleted the account,they cannot charge my credit card (they only tell me AFTER takingmy credit card information!). And now they need me to send in acheck. And no detail on what to write on the check, whatshould be the payable to, what number to write etc, nothing.A very bad business model, plus not-so-good technology, andvery bad customer service. I should sell my 8x8 stock."
1,WORST SERVICE,"The quality of the service was good during the first month after that every day I had one or other problem with the service when called them they are saying they cannot give any guarantee that it can not repeat regularly (in their words, it can happen every day...its not in our hands)..to cancel the service its costing me 59$...*******PLEASE DO NOT BUY THEIR SERVICE*************"
2,"inspite of the dial tone, calls dont go through","I am a customer since Dec 2004. It was great until last couple of weeks.... i am having problems with making calls. There is dial tone but cant make or receive calls. The customer service wait time is usually 10-15 minutes. Most of the time, they dont have a clue on why its happening, though they know that its a problem customers are facing. Once they mentioned that some server was shut down by someone without notification. What kind of employees would do that ?I am going to see how it goes for another couple of weeks and then think of switching to some other provider."
5,Lowest cost and more area codes to choose from.,I purchased the packet8 service to replace my local and long distance service with Verizon. It works great and is saving us alot of money on both local and long distance service. I chose packet8 because it was the only Voip service that could give me a local number and because they are the lowest cost for startup and monthly charges.I have also tried Vonage and have found that Packet8 and Vonage have good voice quality. People at the other end of the connection can't tell the difference between the Packet8 connection and a regular phone.
1,"Bad voice quality, bad customer service, Sucks!","I bought the phone from Amazon and was told that I can get 2 month free trial without risk. After two months bad experience with the phone, I decided to quit. I tried different ways as instructed by the technic support, including reset the router, change to static IP, etc... Still can not work. So I called to cancel the service, and they asked for $59.95 early termination fee...So I either need to pay this uncalled termination fee or bear this bad quality phone?"
5,Great technology,This technology is great. I was asked by my employer to review all available VOIP technologies. After 3 months of testing Packet 8 was the best overall. That convinced me to ditch SBC and switch to Packet 8. I have this service for 1 year now and I could not be happier. I call Europe a lot and European package for $49 is great. I'm saving $100 each month with much better quality.
4,"Good VoIP service, slow LNP processing","The overall service is great, I have even been calling India several times. The only problem seems to be that their LNP process (by which you get your existing local number ported) is pretty slow and their customer service gives no response to emails."
1,"poor customer service, problems with rebate","I have sent all the documents required to process rebate but still they rejected due to missing receipts. Terrible....Customer service is not good. You will have to wait for long time to talk to them.Portability of phone number takes 4-6 with them. Usually it takes couple of days with other companies but with Packet8, it takes for ever. Till that time we will end up paying for both.I suggest you take a look at vonage or some other rated broadband phone service."
4,Packet 8,"I have packet 8 line for a month and a half.For those of you who is complaining about customer servicewhy don't you try BroadVoice.com. That what I would callBAD BAD BAD customer service. My brother spend 20 days withthem on the phone just to get dial tone. After his experiance I've ordered packet8.I could not notice any major delays in the customer service.Well, I haven't tried at 1:30 am but I would not loose my sleepto call any customer service at 1:30am doesn't matter how bad or good they are.Now the real problems with packets8 are:1)CallerID doesn't work the way is suppose to be working.You will never see the name of the calling person,only numbereven if this number is stored in your phone.2)You alway need to call 10 digits numbers , even for thelocal calls which is REALLY annoying."
1,Lousy customer service,"The price is good -- used to be the best but now others are close to matching the price.The quality was usually pretty good, but sometimes there were problems. Still I was a big fan - until I hit my first customer service problem. They shutdown my account (expired credit card) but wanted to charge me for service during the 9 days they didn't provide any service! (The problem originally looked like a tech support problem not a billing glitch). Complaining to customer service was implacable.The bottom line is -- they're not a phone company. They make their own rules, and they don't care what you think. And there's a 1 year service contract, so they surcharge you $60 if you get pissed and want to go to someone else."
1,Watch out!,"I signed up for this service on the one condition that my current phone number be transferred. ""No problem,"" said the sales rep from Packet8. After several months of trying to switch our number over, Packet8 finally agreed they could not use our current phone number. Now they want to charge us a $60 for leaving the service ""after 30 days.""If you want to work with a company that lies to you right off the bat, get your credit card out and call Packet8 immediately."
5,Packet 8 -- Great Service at a Great Price,"I have just installed and activated the service over my DSL line. The call quality is excellent. The main feature I like is the montht to month commitment.The only problem I have faced a few times is that the call goes through, but I cannot hear the opposite party, however they hear me. This has happened only a few times.I would recommend this service.Sunil"
2,Lots of useless facts,This book had lots of fix it facts but most were common sense or useless.How to get super glue off your fingers.. or how to fix a Casette Tape.Seems like this would NOT be the 1st place to look up something when I need to fix it. Its more of a bathroom reader quailty. You may remember what you read here but I will look elsewhere first.
3,AN INTERESTING REFERENCE WHICH IS GETTING OUT OF DATE,"With the technology advancing at such a fast rate, the information presented in the book which was published a decade ago is fast getting out of date."
2,not so much,"When they say ""Just About"" in the title, take that at its meaning. I have not found one thing in this book to be useful. It might be good for someone who is getting their own place for the first time, alone, and they grew up having no experience in fixing stuff. But if you ever had to hold the ladder while your Dad was painting, move along!"
5,Easy book for children to follow,My daughter likes when we read Rock-a-bye Farm. I will start to read a page and she will finish by telling me who the farmer is rocking to sleep. She loves to see the end when everyone is asleep and the stars are shining. It is too bad this is out of print.
5,IMy daughter has loved hearing this book for years,Rock a Bye Farm has been a favorite in my house and I would highly suggest this book to any one that enjoys reading with their children.
2,Rock A Bye Farm,"We really love this story, but this is not our favorite version. My two year old daughter loves the original version but the pictures in this one just don't capture her attention. The story, of course, is still really cute."
2,Rock-a-bye Farm,"I have an earlier published book by the same author, different illustrator. This boardbook was disappointing. I liked the original illustrations and ending much better . This newer one might appeal more if I hadn't seen the earlier version."
2,"It's ""Bugged""","This is a good set except for one thing - the MLB logo ""bug"" in the center-right of the screen. Anyone who can remember when TV didn't have these (meaning you can remember 1986) will be extremely distracted by this. If you think you can put up with it, get the set. I thought this set would mean I could retire my old videotapes, but I guess not. I'd rather watch those than have a big chunk of the screen be obscured."
3,Thee Midniters,The group is great. The songs are great. The sound quality overall is subpar. The linear notes say the music was selected from the best vinyl sources possible. Where are the master tapes? Rhino has Whittier Blvd. on Grandson Of Frat Rock Vol. 3. The sound is crystal clear. They found the tapes. What happened Thump? This group deserves much better.
4,It's a start but read Why They Don't Buy for the full story,A very good book.. but let's get some passion back in there! Real people and real relationships don't live in the software - the software has to support the human warmth and empathy that we can have between us and our customers.An author like Max Mckeown captures that passion and the organisational and technological practicalities required to build processes around people rather than force innocent people to fit into the software that we buy.E-Customer & Why They Don't Buy have made a big impact in Europe but are only just starting to get the recognition that they deserve in the USA. One day they will be regarded as classics!Buy a copy and check out ... for more about a new kind of thinker.
3,Not insightful,This a book that's not terribly insightful about CRM. It's a broad brush overview of commercial applications in the space and some conventional wisdom. Found it to have much repetitious pedantic pages. Wished that there were more discussion on business process and best practices.
5,"i not only read it, i contributed to it....","because i believe in the premise and in dr. marty becker's premise unequivocably. simply put - it's my belief that the bond between human and animal transends species specificity - in other words, it is not about our species, it is about two souls that form a bond. in fact, when a new bond is forged between animal and human, i believe we are acting with grace. science is just now scrambling behind to prove what we all already knew. some things - just are. and so it is with the reciprocal love between animals and humans. thanks, marty, for validating such a deep dimension of my life - my relationship with my animals."
1,Impossible to soften this clay!,"The Amazon reviewer claimed this clay was easy for little fingers to work - not true for my nearly-four-year old, and not true for me! It was hard as a rock. You'd have to work tiny bits at a time to make it workable. My daughter quickly got bored and gave up and I can't say I blame her. A big disappointment"
4,Clay Animation Starter Set,"For basic clay animation, the Alex clay works quite well. The colors are very vivid and the clay is soft without being melty like Crayola's modeling clay. The clay tools in this package won't last forever, but the variety included give a budding animator--and his or her imagination-- a power boost of possibilities.Note: Alex's clay, also availoable in different size packages, is especially good for flat tabletop clay animation. If you are using armatures and more elaborate methods, you should use Omyacolor or Van Aken modeling clay for a little more firmness."
5,Great CD!!,I love this CD. It is Latin jazz at it's best. All the players sound great and the tunes are wonderful. Highly recommended!!!Eric
4,Top Notch Latin Jazz,"As a latin jazz listener, it's always interesting to find a recording that exceeds your expectations. This recording by Sammy Figueroa is top notch."
1,This is insane....,"You can get Mac OS X for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the Microsoft's 227 dollar Home Premium which is the low end. Buy Mac and get all the functionality in one OS. When spec'ed out the system are comparable in price, except apple doesn't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive."
1,Vista Can Put You Out of Business,"There are serious compatability and speed issues with Vista. Count on much of your current bussiness software not to run. Count on having difficulty downgrading back to Windows XP as Microsoft has rigged Vista to make it difficult to downgrade without buying a new XP from themVista is processor and memory heavy. It will dramatically slow older computers. Even with a newer computer it may appear no faster than windows xp and possibly slower. I however, have the home edition on my brand new home computer and it is plenty fast. However, the premium and business editions are much slower and require more memory.I recommend never to put Vista on a computer with less than a duo core processor and 2 MB of memory. All businsess owners should stay away for at least a year until all compatability issues have been resolved - assuming that is possible."
1,Illegal Sale?,"Took kit to repair shop but was unable to use because the CD's had on them ""NOT FOR SALE"" so I could not use them."
5,Windows Vista,"Windows Vista is an excellent product. Installed good and clean on my computer. I just wish someone had the device driver for my printer, a Lexmark Z82 that has been working good when I was running XT. If you know of anyone providing Vista drivers for this pronter please let me know!"
1,the worst thing that happened to microsoft,"What is Windows Vista? A faied Mac-wannabe. Honestly, I you're tryin to copy something. At least do it good! Windows Vista is slow with a whole bunch of annoying things that pop out at the most annoying tims. DO NOT buy it. I like XP much better...."
1,Dog Slow,"This must be the slowest OS on this planet. All the DRM 'enchancements' and other bloatware that MS decided to put in the kernel has made this the slowest operating system ever built, you need a 20% faster computer to get to the same level with XP.Then there's the issue of endless 'Are you sure you want to do this' confirmations whatever you try to do. Clicking thru these dialogs gets so annoying you wish to throw your PC out the window. This is definitely the last piece of MS software I'll ever buy."
5,In Mir Klingt Ein Lied,this album is a wonderful example of montserrat caballe's more recent recordings.her soft notes and pure legato is as lovely as ever. viva Caballe! this album is divine because she sings a duet with her daughter montserrat marti and a touching ave maria by mascagni.
3,Not exactly as advertised,36 Unreleased Recordings were not all new songs; some were just alternate versions of 50s and 60s hits. I was disappointed that only a portion was truly unreleased in the sense of not having been heard before.
2,Been there done that,"If you're familiar with several people in the self-help field, you'll find very little new material here."
5,Faultless performances,"I must agree with my Australian friend, as I have also owned this recording for years and regularly come back to it. The motets from Symphoniae Sacrae I are small in scale, but are all extremely beautiful. Apart from his Psalmen Davids (1619), this collection is my favorite of Schutz's published output.The music is unfailingly expressive and innovative, plus the performances given are perfectly judged and do great justice to these fantastic works. There is constant variety of voices and instrumentation such that no two motets share the same scoring. I especially like In lectio per noctes which employs three curtals under soprano and alto voices. It's an exquisite texure.This is a recording any fan of Schutz should not be without."
2,Doesn't hold up to winter,"I ordered this last fall and covered My A/C unit. This spring it had multiple places where the vinyl was peeling off like a cheap grill cover does. There are no actual holes in it yet, but it looks bad and I think if I keep using it there will be more problems. I would have expected it to last a few seasons before doing this."
3,"Great music but don't call it ""The Muppets""","If you're thinking of buying this album for the music - I highly recommend it. The music is enjoyable. There are some great versions of old classics as well as some brand new songs that are just as enjoyable.If you're thinking of buying this album due to nostalgia for the Muppets - don't. With a few exceptions, these are NOT the Muppets!! I agree with Joseph Morrow - it would have been much better to simply have focused on characters that they had the voices for then to try and fool us into thinking this is the Muppets we all know and love. I feel very let down!"
3,"Eh, just okay.",I found this CD for half the Amazon price at Walmart. It is okay. Really just okay. I wouldn't pay $10 for it. There are about three songs I really like. Fozzy Bear's comedy club track is pretty funny for little kids. My 5-year old thinks that track is pretty funny. Overall just okay. Wish it was better.
1,Realize When A Good Thing Is Over,"It's unfortunate that greed and the 'commercial machine' keep this dead horse crannking out worthless garbage to sell. When Jim Henson died, the muppets died with him. They were great while he was alive - now they are just ridiculous parodies of what they once were. Integrity should stop these albums from being made, but the love of filthy money at any cost will undoubtedly keep them coming. Break out your great original muppets Christmas material - but don't support these modern fake attempts to rejuvinate something which is gone forever."
1,Mistake,"I ordered a CD that turned out not to have the song I wanted. Two CDs were sent in error--mine or the vendors??? I remember having some difficulty with the site while placing the order. Anyway, I returned them both."
5,Muppets are awesome!,Who doesn't love the Muppets? This is great music that makes Christmas just a whole lot of fun! It's honestly amazing!
2,Not that great...,"I have always loved the muppets, so when I saw this album was on sale for .99, I bought it. To be fair there are a couple of cute songs like Piggy's version of ""Santa Baby"" and ""A red and green Christmas"". Thats about it. The rest of the songs are not very good. My kids didn't like them either. I would not reccomend buying this album. Sorry."
3,i really wanted to like this...,",,, but it just didn't capture my imagination.i love the muppets, and some of the tracks are nice.some are unlistenable.the record is a disappointment.it has moments, but not enough to redeem it.it is generally boring.and i'm sad to write that."
4,I liked it,"I think this is the best Christmas CD for kids that I've heard. It's not obnoxious, so I can stand to listen to it. Most kids' CDs make my ears bleed. It's fun for my toddler to dance to. The only downside is that the songs are not ""catchy"" enough for him to sing along to. But he still loves the CD, and they use original songs instead of the same tired old Christmas diddies. If you love the Muppets, this is a great CD."
5,A good old Album,I got this album while looking for old time Christmas songs. The songs are good and the whole album is a story that tells of the Muppet Christmas. It's too bad that they don't do these anymore. In the end it's good for kids and adults a like.
4,Good basic instruction for beginners,"My 2 teen kids are getting lessons and the instructor chose this course. It works to teach the basics, it is not glamourous and it is not fun, but the lessons are clear, and progress is there from day one. I found the dvd also helpful.Enjoy.Jb"
3,Good book,This is a good book for those who wants to play solo. When I ordered it I thought it was a guitar accompany chord but it isn't it is a soloist chord.
5,Always a pleasure with Amazon,Amazon has always provided me with excellent material for my students.Thank You Amazon
1,old boring outdated method,I am a player and have taught guitar for over 25 years. I learned with this method at one point and it almost made me quit playing. The songs are boring and anyone born in the past 30 years will find the music to be more what your grandfather would like.Standard notation I beleive should be taught but after the student can play some first. It should be taught independantly also. Dont waste your time if your are a teacher or student. Get something more modern that will teach music you listen to.
5,"Used it then, using it again","I took up guitar in the late 1960's and distinctly recall my guitar teacher telling me that I had to learn to read music first and foremost. Mel Bay's modern guitar method accomplishes that goal. I gave up guitar when my instructor was drafted to Vietnam. Here I am 30+ years later giving the guitar another go and made the decision to use the Mel Bay modern method of instruction again, because I want to read music as well as play it!"
4,Great book; gets them reading music!,"I've taught around 25 students out of this book and I think it's one of the best out there for beginning guitar players. It doesn't let them use guitar tab as a crutch like some of the books out there; they learn to read music! Don't get me wrong, I teach them how to read tab as it can be a great tool, but not until they've learned the fundamentals of music first. I wish there was a book like this with a more recognizable songs though. I'm familiar with around half of the songs/melodies, and the kids know even less. The tunes were probably common when the book was written, decades ago, but I usually supplement the book with written songs that I write out that they will be more familiar with. The fundamentals and teaching method are excellent though."
3,Not for Self-Learning,"Good book for a beginning guitarist, but must be used in a class or private lesson setting. The novice will be lost if trying to use this book on his or her own. Some of the practice songs are out-dated, even though musically valid for learners."
3,its delicious,I used this product many years ago and it was the best. I was so glad to find it on your web site. It makes garlic bread that is absolutely delicious. Better price than regular grocery stores. Love it!!!
5,JAPANESE WARRIOR IN THE FUTURE,IROSHI IS THE STORY OF LADY WARRIOR WHO'S DESTINYWAS TO START A WARRIOR SCHOOL WITH THE HELP OFSPIRITS OF DEAD ALIEN WARRIORS. OSBORN CREATESA VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT TECHOLOGICAL MARVELSAND AGE OLD EMOTIONS OF HONOR AND BETRAYAL.
2,Blah.,"Boring, with unoriginal ideas. Unlikable characters, silly, just silly. Grade school reading, just above Bantha Fodder."
2,Not the best,"The story here is interesting, but I found it difficult to plow through because of the poor writing. The dialog tended toward speeches, and I never knew any child to behave or speak like these two children did. These two were in some ways, more mature than some 40-year-olds I've known. The description sometimes read like a travelogue, and the love scenes were, well, trite. If you can get past that, or if you don't care, then read the book. The ghost, the fires, the time-travel--it's not bad. But then again, it's not the best."
2,Pretty but SLOW to boot and shutdown,"Slow from power on pc to desktop and shutdown slower than XP as well. As other reviewer mentioned you cant use upgrade DVD to ever do a clean install if needed, in the past XP allowed that. The speed of the Vista once loaded feels the same to me as xp but it just seems like they could had trimmed some time off the boot up or shut down."
3,Microsoft Vista Business Upgrade? It's not simple.,"After 3 days of trying I gave up and did a clean install.That went well, but bringing over old files is still a pain. In older applications such as Lotus you will find help no longer works. Almost every program that ran well on XP has given me some sort of problem on Vista.My suggestion would be to not load any program not made byMicrosoft untill Vista runs flawlessly for a long time.If I had it to do over I would wait a year or so before making the change."
5,Used to upgrade to windows 7,"Product was as expected, installed it, then put the windows 7 upgrade on. Took a windows xp machine to windows 7, never had to activate or run it. Since Microsoft could not be bothered to create an upgrade path to 7 from XP, this was the only way to preserve my programs without having to reinstall."
1,Shoddy software after six years of development,"I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista. After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't. After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP. I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft. If you want something that works, buy a Mac."
3,Dated but still good,"This dictionary, in the form available in the US and in Canada, is still the best general English and Esperanto dictionary available, however, because there has not been an update since 1954, (don't be fooled by the copyright dates!), it has fallen behind times. Don't expect to find such words as videorecorder, modem, disk drive or any other high-tech vocabulary here.I understand that there is a updated version available in the United Kingdom, however, because of some copyright problem it is not available in North America. Let's hope the problem can be resolved soon."
5,Class Has Sick Skills,"Well Classified Was Unknown To Me Till My Gf Told Me Bout Him. Very First Song I Got Was ""This Is For""(best song he has made) For All ppl who like To listen to sick skills Mint Lyrics .... Get This Cd It has it all.. ""Trial And error"" Go Get It!"
3,A sort of letdown on Part 2,Let me say first im a huge Haack fan and own most of his records on cd- atleast the ones i was able to find! But to my ears this followup concept album to his amazing 'electric Lucifer album from 1969/70 falls below his usual high standards of weirdness! Theres a lack of story compared to the first and a repeative musical motiv that fails to capture the excitement and variety of volume one! In my opinion a better option for a new fan would be the cheaply priced Haackula cd which is not only much better but does this style of vocoder robotica to perfection! A few numbers like Stand up lazarus are classic Haack but overall i seldom listen to this cd.I do highly recommend these albums though- The Electric lucifer- Eelctronic record for children* Haackula and Bite* or any of the assorted comps on Haack. However the ones with stars are almost impossible to find or will set you back 50-150 dollars
5,Overpriced by the phony publisher,"This is a wonderful book. The only problem is it is badly overpriced by ""DIANE"" who states she is the publisher.The real publisher is the University of Wyoming and this 9th edition priced at $45.00. The real publisher didn't realize they had to get a new ISBN number for the new edition. So the 9th edition bears the old ISBN number 0-941570-134.Perhaps Amazon could assign a number with the publisher's correct price of $45, not $60.00"
5,a must for native plant gardeners,"This book isn't for everyone, but it really fills a gaping hole in the reference library of any gardener interested in the use of native plants, xeriscape gardening, wildflower cultivation, etc. For anyone who has ever let a yard go to seed ""just to see what happens"" (or dreamed of doing so) this book helps you determine what weeds are really weeds and what weeds are hidden treasures. The book is amply illustrated with photos of both mature plants and seedlings, which helps you determine what to get rid of after monsoon rains have done their part. The descriptions are clear and the index functions fine. Plus I just love the idea of having an entire book on weeds!"
5,Prime Source,This is a prime source for identifying weeds or native flora of the area. It's great fun for what might be a very dull walk and have it turn into a wonderful opportunity to become familiar with this space on earth. Weeds of the West has done this for me and I have enjoyed it immensely. It gives me exactly what I want to know with sharp illustrations. This book is worth the purchase for anyone curious about their surroundings.
4,Non-natives are weeds.,"This book is one of the best available for some weeds. However, it does name some native plants as weeds because they are toxic to livestock. Weeds are by definition non-native."
4,Better than most bluesmen's greatest hits!,"This cd is a collection of outtakes, alternate versions, and various rare tracks from King's stretch at Stax records. It says a lot about the quality of King's recordings that these leftover tracks are better than most bluesmen's greatest hits! Absolutely no one could bend strings like Albert King, and Stax always provided him with a first-rate backing band. Usually outtakes albums like this are only recommended for fans who already own the other releases, but I would totally recommend ""Hard Bargain"" for ANYONE interested in hearing some great blues."
1,bad compressor,"I purchased a combo pack, 1 month after the warranty ran out the compressor stopped working, I took it to a locate service center , which stated motor barins where gone and it would be $240 to replace, it was cheaper to buy a new one. When I emailed porter cable , it took a long time for a response , by then i had bought a new ( different make)compressor. they build them so you have to buy more parts then you need. Look a different model."
1,porter cable compressor,"I purchased the 6 gallon pancake compressor in OCT 03, did not use it until Jan 04, used for (2) months,it is extremely noisy, heats up, stops working after 15-29 minutes of use. I contacted customer service, only to be given the run-a-round."
1,unit died after one year,Only one year of light use (some framing and some finish work) and it already died. I have heard from independent vendors that this unit is NOT reliable. Especially at altitude it is under powered. I would not recommend it.
5,Porter Cable compressor,I have had no problems with the compressor. It's relatively quiet and delivers all that was promised. I do not hesitate to give a five-star review
1,What you see is Not what you Get!,What Amazon shows you is a picture of a CPFAC2600P-1 or a CPFAC2600P-2. What you get is a -3 model which is totally different. Don't be fooled! To start with there is no pressure switch.(Black box on the left side of the gauges in their picture.)part# D20668
1,Little compressor is full of hot air,I've owned this compressor for about 1 year. I'm not a contractor so it hasn't been used continuously. It died about a month ago. It get's so hot it shuts itself off.I spoke to the Porter Cable rep at the Columbus wood show last month. By his own admission these little oilless pancake jobs are junk. He says he wished PC wouldn't sell them.
1,power but not reliable,"I bought this compressor for it's light weight, portability and compact power all of which it lived up to until it broke within 40 hours of use. After calling Porter Cable they proved to be less than useful telling me that I would have to drive the unit an hour to get fixed under warrenty and were unsympathetic to my situation. It will cost me more in time a gas to fix under warrenty than to buy a different brand.(Which I intend to do.) This may be why you see so many reconditioned units in stores."
1,not reliable,"I've owned this for 8 months. At first it lived up to Porter Cable's reputation: worked great and was moderately priced. Until it broke. It will cost more to fix than to buy another one.The bundled packages they have now with this model (the compressor with a brad nailer and finish nailer) are very appealing price-wise, but don't be suckered as I and the many others above me have."
1,This compressor is all hot air,I've only had this compressor about 1 year. I am a home woodshop enthusiast with only the occasional venture into some one elses home for some sort of home repair or remodel.This compressor gets very hot and shuts itself off. I was at the Columbus Wood Show about 2 weeks ago and the Porter Cable rep told me that the oil-less compressors are junk.Save your money. Don't buy one.
1,Porter-Cable Pancake Compressor,"Bought it for small size and weight - took it out of the box, ran it for 5 min.It was very loud and ran hot!!! - motor craped out soon after need to return get my money back - will not buy this junk again THANKS A LOT!!!!"
4,Good but noisey.,"I used this compressor all summer building decks and other carpentry jobs. Runs perfect and is powerful. Also easy to transport. Handles all nail guns, and showed some weakness only when using a big impact wrench while removing lug nuts on tires. It can handle the job. I wish it were a little quieter."
2,short-lived compressor,I bought the porter-cable pancake compressor about a year and a half ago. I chose porter-cable because all of my air tools and most of my corded tools are porter-cable. They have performed well and are a great value for the money. The pancake compressor was the oil-less version and the compressor went bad after 16 months. I only used it in my shop on limited occasions until a few months ago I framed up the walls of my basement. I noticed a strange smell and took it to a porter-cable authorized service center. They told me it needed rebuilt and would cost about as much as a new one to rebuild it. They informed me that oil-less compressors often do not hold up. They recommended a better built compressor. This web site has the best price for the one they recommended.
2,"Nice Vetiver, Disgusting Ashtray","The vetiver smells amazing, but there is a really disgusting ashtray note that appears within ten minutes, thereby making this unwearable. Get Vetiver de Puig instead. It has the same vetiver as the Guerlain without the stinky ashtray. The same people who told me I smelled really old, and like marijuana while I was wearing the Guerlain complimented me so much when I wore the Puig. Think for yourself. Don't let peer pressure push you towards the Guerlain. The Puig is much better."
2,"Just Way too unrealistic, Get C.O.D. for PC","This game was horrible. I mean theres FPS that are unrealistic but fun, but this game just wasn't as fun as the COD on the pc's. I mean who wants to see the guy die the same time 12 times in a row! The only part of this game I liked on COD was the online multiplayer. The number of people was great, the environments were decent and the killing was really fun. I gotta give props for the Multiplayer. Even when i started out and i wasn't used to it, i came out of the round with at least 10 or 11 kills. The Campaign is horrible but the Multi-player is pretty good"
4,Game is too freaking easy,"I got this game Christmas Day I beat it the next day man this game is easy no matter what setting you put it on! If you have to save a guy he just keeps running ahead of you and gets killed to were you have to start the whole level over again, stay behind me and you will live dang you LOL. When I put the game in it looked just like MOH. This game is now going to sit on my shelf and get dust on it cause once you beat the game is BORING playing it again!"
4,"An Upgraded Version of ""Medal of Honor""","""Call of Duty"" for PS2 can be fairly described as a nicely upgraded version of Medal of Honor. My favorite ""new"" features are 1) the great number of battles which require you to work in tandem with your fellow squad members (often 5 or more) 2) scenes in which you have to work as a footsoldier or sniper in tandem with Allied tanks 3) scenes in which you are controlling a tank and 4) playing from the perspective of the British and Soviets as well as the USA. Overall, COD is great fun. But I wouldn't say it's qualitatively different from the MOH experience."
2,pathetic attempt at redoing the pc version,I have played the pc version of call of duty and it was an amazing game the ps2 version crap. Horrible graphics and stale gameplay make this game look like a turd in the toiltet compared to its pc counterpart even if you never played the pc version you wouldn't liket his game. A complete waste of money do not bother with this game.
1,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THIS GAME WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. THE GRAPHICS SUCKED!!! THERE WAS NO MULTIPLAYER OTHER THAN ONLINE. THERE WERE NO INGAME SAVE POINTS, NO MATTER HOW LONG THE LEVEL. THERE WAS A LACK OF GOOD WEAPONS AND VEHICLES. IF YOU LIKE GOOD WWII GAMES THEN GET MEDAL OF HONOR FOR PC. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. I DID AND NOW I AM SELLING IT ON [...]. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.thank you"
1,"Pretty Cool, just the graphics(are not very pleasing).","The gamplay is great, the weapons are great, and the missions are great. The only thing that is NOT great is the GRAPHICS. They are pretty bad. Still, it's a good game. And not just any one can play it. You need to like the genre to like it. Rent it first, and see how it goes."
4,call of duty finest hour,This game is awesome. You get to be Russian then British and finally American.The levels are action packed and you get some great guns like the Thomson and the BAR. The good things about this game are 1. The levels are fun and action packed 2. The game is very realistic and true to what happened in the war. 3. The game has realistic guns and grenades. 4. You are at cities like Stalingrad and you go on ppa raids in North Africa. 5. The levels are hard and tough to beat.
3,Which game shold i get a Call Of Duty game or Brothers In Arms.,"It is puzz;ing me-I am not interested in Medal Of Honor as they are old and haven`t recieved a good review sinch MOH3:FrontLine.I hear good comments on Brothers In Arms AND on Call Of Duty games-I love War games FPS or TPS-as well as Military strategies like Ghost Recon and SOCOM games.So which should i get COD or BIA.On ""Is this review hepful"" thing Please click NO for BIA and YES for COD.It would be ghreat help from U guys.Thanks 4 reading.-------------""A name means nothin` on a battlefield after a weak no one has a name:Solid Snake MGS1/Big Boss MGS3"
3,"ok, it doesnt need to be longer!!!!!!",wat is up w/ all u losers sayin games need 2 b longer??? this game is really hard i dont like it that much because i cant get far enough AND there is like 30 missions HOW IN HELL DOES IT NEED TO BE LONGER?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,couldn't play it,at the beging its sooo dark you cant even see anything that its UN playable. but after that i spent like 3 hours i got used it . but its still COD. so have fun
5,Call of Duty: Finest Hour is the best war game ever,"Out of all the war games ever made, Call of Duty: Finest Hour is the best war game that no one could imagine how good it really is. It gives you real live war events from the past wars. I would put this on your Christmas list because you don't want to miss actin packed game. This game is so realistic, it would kill Medal of Honor and abd Ghost Recon. Those are good games but not even close as good as Call of Duty. People just by the game and you will thank me later."
3,Nothing Special,"I was extremely dissappointed with Call of Duty. I was drawn in with its claims of realism. Thats a huge overstatement. The game is exactly like MOH. And for anyone who's ever played MOH, you know what that means: stupid enemies and basically unlimited ammo.The only thing we haven't seen before in this game is riding around in a tank. I know what your thinking: OOHH, that sounds like fun. Forget it. Its bland and boring. You drive down a pre-determined path and shoot enemies that ""happen"" across your path.Even if you like WWII shooters, you probably won't like this one. Its basically every bad WWII shooter packed into one. Use at your own risk."
5,Great WWII Game,"This Game was a great WWII Game filled with action, strategy, and requires a good head on your shoulders. It's graphics aren't as good as soccom II, but are more like Medal Of Honor. If you like metal of honor, then you will love this. There are some great sound effects, for example the German stukas coming in, and the ""tink, tink , tink"" the grenade makes when it is thrown.You play in North Africa, Western Front, and as the British. You get to control an M12 tank, and shoot the 50 caliber of a jeep, and of course your on foot most of the time.The only problem I see in this game, is you cannot play it in two player co-op missions, but you should know that going into it. It is also in the first person, in case you wanted to know.Hope You Like It!!"
3,I loved the PC versions - but am let down.,"Sorry - I wanted to like this... I bought it the first day it was out.The PC Versions are fantastic. This is fairly difficult to play and does not have nearly the same cinematic, realistic, 3D feel of it's PC counterpart.Maybe worth it at $ 19.99?"
4,A Good WWII Game,"This game is a great World War II game and very challenging. The first level is nothin, but the second took me forever. You play as Russians in the Russian Front, the British in Africa for a couple levels, and then the Americans in the capture of Germany. The graphics are decent, the AI could be better but its much better than Medal of Honor. There's a lot of weapons compared to some other games, and a good story line. You command tanks, anti aircraft guns and squads of men. You have to give the game some time to beat it, its not easy at all. But thats what video games r supposed to be, hard. This is a great game."
2,Another average WWII game...,"Call of Duty: Finest Hour is simply just another WWII game. It has decent graphics (although faces look horrible and animations aren't great) and sound, with a good framerate, but gameplay is standard fare. Of course it has its ""epic"" moments (Stalingrad in this game), but even they are getting stale. Also, there is too long of a gap between checkpoints, causing a headache-inducing amount of backtracking everytime you die.I'm a big fan of first-person shooters, and I loved the original Medal of Honor: Allied Asault. This game, however, is just another console FPS based on WW2. Rent it first, see if you like it. The actor who plays President Palmer on ""24"" does some narration, which is probably the best part of the game."
4,"Not a huge Cake fan, but love these guys","I have never been a big Cake fan, I always felt they sounded too mechanical and cold. On the same token, I can't imagine many fans of Cake's style warming up to this either. But, this reminds me of pure 70's style power pop like 20/20 and the Shoes (if you've ever heard ""Yellow Pills"" by 20/20 it sounds like a song from these sessions)combined with a Todd Rundgren or Roy Thomas Baker production (I'm leaning more toward RTB with the Cars). The styles careen from track to track with my favorites being My Lunatic Friends and Zero. Only Lies made me think of Devo crossed with Imperial Teen, and is another favorite. What Would You Do is a very catchy song that should have been all over the radio, it's almost too perfect!!!When I put this CD on, it always takes me back to lazy hazy days in the 70's and 80's, and that's pretty remarkable for a group of songs that weren't even around during those times!!"
3,So-So,Worth a listen if you're a bit bored and want something a little different - not quite as cakey as some reviewers have said. One of those albums you dig out a couple of times a year and listen to.
5,Better than cream soda...,"They'll refresh your senses and tickle your ears. The melodies are addictive, the lyrics tasty, and the sweet aftertaste lingers for days. Deathray is the way!"
2,Not so interesting.,"I expected more coming from an ex-member of Cake. I am amused that these blokes thought it would be a good idea to do an 80's rock re-hash, but what happens here is rather dull. The songs ape styley cleverness, but without the strong melodic underpinnings I enjoyed from Cake. Sounds like American rock radio fare, replete with many fine production bells and whistles and beefy guitar, but without interesting or sincere content. Cake was more scruffy and stylistically crude, but with hooks all over the place. This cd left me feeling not much."
2,Sigh!,"I had to buy this book as a textbook for a course I am taking online through American Military University. For some reason AMU loves to use outdated and boring books, probably because they are written by fellow professors. Don't buy this book unless you have to."
5,A truly enjoyable read,"Several stories thrown together allow one to travel with the good doctor, a ""Soldier of Light"". A most enjoyable read as you travel with Doc and his trusty sidekick and they travel the galaxy getting into and out of trouble"
1,hack work,"Not only was L. Ron Hubbard a hack but he was a lousy hack. The character of Ole Doc is a medical Lone Ranger of outer space, and the stories are Westerns of the type one heard on afternoon radio in the 1930s and 40s. Without actors to vivify the situations, they and the characters fall flat. However, the recent audio adaptation by 2000x (available from Audible.com) has a great deal of OTR charm. It is far better than the original."
5,The meteor rocket is awesome! Our kids love it.,"Our family has had a very good experience with the meteor rocket. It was given to our son as a birthday present and he's been having a great time with it. The directions for assembling the rocket were easy to follow and we didn't have any trouble putting it together. What I am most impressed by is how high the rocket flies with just baking soda and vinegar as fuel. It really does go up about 100 feet - to the great delight and amazement of our chiildren and all the assembled neighborhood kids. As a parent, I like the fact that the ""fuel"" is safe, and we can usually find a box of baking soda and some vinegar in the kitchen when the kids decide they want to do some rocket flying. There's a lot of educational value in this project. We've used the kit for some impromptu ""science lessons"" to explain and then demonstrate the power of chemical reactions. Everyone in our family thinks the rocket is awesome, and we highly recommend it."
2,Mostly disappointing,"Although my feelings aren't quite as strong as the first reviewer's, I was also disappointed with the kit. It's a fairly complex building job, and the resulting rocket isn't great, and is decidedly fragile, good for 3 or 4 launches max before needing extensive repairs. It's performance is mediocre at best."
2,... for a pop bottle?,"We bought this kit and put it together. It wasn't too hard to do but the rocket is very fragile. The kit is (structurally) a very, very poor design. When it comes down to it, it is a pop bottle with some cheap, flimsy fluff parts for decoration. I couldn't believe we paid ... for this thing. After only 3 mediocre launches (under 20 ft) the flimsy red plastic at the front of the rocket had split and the nose cone was cracked almost in half. In addition, the rocket fins were damaged. The toy .... I'm going to try and save you ... here. Don't waste your money on it!"
3,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","My son got this kit for his birthday. We had a lot of fun putting it together, but when it came time to launch, the fun ended. It did manage to lift off, but after a couple of mediocre launches, the rocket was in such bad shape, it was unuseable. Very poorly made. What not buy this for what it cost."
3,Not built to last!,"Our boys had a good time with this toy, but after a 5-6 launches it broke! Not just the wings but the plastic body. I feel like it was a waste of money and over priced."
4,Baking Soda and Vinegar Rockets are cool!,"Kids (and adults) will enjoy the Meteor Rocket Kit. Based on the chemical reaction of baking soda and vinegar, this kit will help kids build a rocket that can propel up to 100' into the sky. This kit contains instructions and other necessary components for rocket building such as a plastic bottle, balsa wood and a nose cone. Our rocket didn't exactly shoot 100' into the air, but it was fun to build the rocket and everyone REALLY loved seeing the rocket take off due to the baking soda and vinegar reaction. You will need to supply your own baking soda and vinegar.I received this item complimentary in exchange for an honest review. The opinion in this review is all mine."
3,Rocket Science Kit,"My 8 yr old, was extremely excited to receive a rocket for Christmas, and could not wait to put it together. Very disappointed in the quality of items in the kit. Unfortunately the directions were printed out of order, and therefore very hard to follow, we managed after an hour or two to put it together. The rocket launches before we are able to place on the launch pad. After two launches it seems the rocket wont last for many more."
2,Needs Improvement!,"This toy is a disappointment, the kit is overpriced for what it contains & the function of the rocket is terrible. Building the kit went fine & is enjoyable (which is half the reason to buy kits such as these) & the theory of operation is sound. The problem we had with the rocket is the stopper pops out just as soon as you set it down thus there is no time for pressure to build and the thing just goes about 10 feet into the air. If I try to tighten the stopper it slips out of the bottle opening again & again. I'm going to try to roughen up the bottle opening & the rubber stopper (or try a different stopper) to see if we can get it to stay in place - if this works the rocket should fly much better."
2,More work than play; Convoluted instructions.,"Carving the balsa wood pieces under template, plus cutting, sizing, and attaching various pieces together lends a real feeling of anticipation. Unfortunately, unless you get it JUST right (and even when you do), it is rather anti-climactic. If you're one who loves the tinkering and assembly and isn't overly concerned about results, this is for you. About an hour of ""fun"" with that, then several misfires and a lucky shot or two (and a bottle or two of vinegar), and its about time to hang it up. Unless, of course you have lots of patience and determination.HELPFUL HINT: If you buy this, check out the ""instructions supplement"" regarding the fin attachment that is included but not shown in the parts list. Makes for much sturdier fins that will stay on and takes lots of time off the original assembly.I would rate this toy ""fair"", but at almost $20, its too much."
3,It's okay.,"took a whole gallon of vinegar before we got one decent liftoff. It's okay for an intro to rocket science, but don't expect it to fly out of the backyard. I paid $20 at Barnes and Noble. It does provide some time with your kids in assembling the rocket, but c'mon, the thrill is in the liftoff.I bought another gallon to keep trying, but my son didn't have enough interest to go out this weekend to try again. He is 7."
1,Didn't Work,"My 7 year old was excited about this gift, but it doesn't work. The stopper does not form a tight seal and as soon as I turn the rocket to mix the baking soda with the vinegar, the stopper flies off from the slight pressure build-up. Pretty dangerous if you happen to be in the way. We tried 3 times with the same results. Also, the instructions are also printed out of order, but it wasn't too much of a problem to figure out. Very disappointed that we wasted 1 hour and $20 on this product. It has the potential to be really fun."
3,Nice idea but didn't work for us,Fun to build but poor manufacturing of the nozzle meant that we could not tighten it into the bottle adequately to form a good seal - basically it strips. We got a few decent launches out of it but it would have gone much higher if the nozzle weren't stripped.
1,"Poorly designed, terrible instructions, minimal educational value","The kit's instructions are poorly designed, hard to follow, and do not cover the science involved with the rocket apart from a few poorly written paragraphs: Under the heading ""Rocket fuel from food"" it says ""The METOR flies for the same reasons (sic). Mixing baking soda and vinegar causes a chemical reaction that makes carbon dioxide gas.""The stopper design does not work well.The kit has about $2 dollars worth of parts in it and little educational value.This kit is to be avoided."
3,A project for two.,This toy takes a lot of supervision. Even when constructed it is a tricky process to get it to launch. We lauched it about 6 times with the best shot reaching about 60 ft. We all learned about rocket construction and chemistry.
2,it is ok,"the rockets i usually launch go about 1500-3000 feet inthe air so this to wasn't as good ,but then the rockets i like have fire come out of the bottom and are more fun yet the get lost to easy you have to go a big place to luanch them and the engines are sold separtly. Then again this has to do with house old items and is cheaper."
2,IMAGES OF IMAGES,"Peter Lindbergh should stay with fashion photography, staged and stagnant, with women who are only capable of recognizing themselves. With the exception of three or four photographs, most of the women appear to be projecting a lifeless imitation of some human feeling or expression. Even more remarkable is his ability to photograph a nude or semi-nude woman and remove from her any projection of sensuality or femininity. They seem to have the warmth of a mannequin, which in fairness to Lindbergh,may be the truth which he captures."
4,"excellent photos, paperback book binding weak","The photos are beautiful and the prints are excellent, but the 'ties that bind' this work of art together are weak. I have had this book for a couple of years, but have only looked through it less than 10 times, and the binding glue is coming loose. This is letting the interior sections move around and basically ruining the whole book. Buyer beware on the crappy construction of this book. The only upside I see is that when the pages finally fall out, I can put some in frames as art."
5,Perfect!,"If you really love photography, and if you really like beautiful women, look no more, this is it! Amber, Naomi, Helena, Linda, Tatiana, et al."
1,why buy an expensive iron that will stop working after three uses?,"The item arrived very quickly and appeared to work fine, but after the third use it stopped working. While it worked, it was wonderful. Probably the best iron I ever used. But now when I plug it in, the light goes on and blinks, and the iron remains cold. Called the toll free number, got nowhere. I don't have the box it came in, so no returns. This is an expensive item, and I was hoping for more. When it was working, it was so good I was going to buy another for my friend. Not anymore!"
5,The real Mozart,"I am very excited about this album and even being a musical dilettante with amateur knowledge, I'd take a chance to say a couple of words.For Luc Devos, this is just a hot keyboard music- Great! For Kuijken, it is an opportunity to take over whenever there is a chance. So, we listen to real Mozart. It is elegant, expressive music, on a moments fast, even explosive but above all there is a variety of phrases, scales, little solos and repetitions, that sparkles through this sonatas . Vary interesting would also be a set of Mozart's sonatas played by Schroeder/Immerseel and their approach complete the best performance available these days. Everything else, like dozens of Perlman and Szering fall under category of ""vibrato/romantic"" and luck of taste . So don't miss to have this CD.Mirro"
2,Must appreciate bird books,"I was assigned to read this book for a class. Over the years I have read many books for classes and for presentations. This book, while inspired, takes a certain reader to appreciate. This book has a specific audience in mind. If you fall into that audience of bird watchers and naturalists, you will truly find a wonderful book. However, if you are only slightly interested in the natural wildlife of Florida, this book may keep you from opening another for a long time."
3,short game,I got this game for christmas.my dad gave it to me.I put it in my gamecube and started playing. I finished 2 days later.It is not worth buying.
4,Ok,This was an okay game. I beat in about 4 days. The end was the hardest for me. If you have alot of time get this game
1,Paid for nothing,"I haven't been able to play the game or even start the game, because no one informed me that there is a different system for the ps2 in the United States and in Greece. I had to re-buy the game here in Greece (more expensive of course)."
1,CRAP!!!!,"This game SUCKED!!!!! The inventions are SSSOOOOOO Lame, and the enemies arestupid! For example, those two pale girls from the movie dance around you, and then spit at you, AND IT HURTS YOU!!!!!! The first time you encounter the bald guy, HE THROWS MEATBALLS AT YOU!!! The second time he hurts you with musical notes!!!!! And in the 3rd movie scene, you kill sailors with peppermints, but they hurt you by throwing fish and moldy cheese at you!!!! The only fun part is shoving Sunny down a pipe and assisting her suicide by making her fall of the pipe!! rent this game before you buy it!!!!"
1,pretty dissapointing,i got this game for my birth day it was so bad that when i played it i threw it out trust me its not a good game and the books are horrible too i just want to punch that kid with the glasses
5,"Adventure Playzone is ""good stuff""","I bought this product as a gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday after she played in a similar one at a friend's party. She absolutely loves this tunnel! It was super easy to assemble and my daughter plays in it almost every day. She even throws balls from her ball pit into it, so she's finding clever ideas to add to the fun. I highly recommend this product. :-)"
1,THIS STROLLER FOLED UP WITH MY 6 MONTH OLD INSIDE!,"DO NOY BUY THIS STROLLER!!! My six month old son was in the back seat and it completely folded up and LOCKED!!It took 2 huge men and 5 mintues to break this stroller to get him out. I don't care if it is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance that it happened to me i would not ever buy this stroller again. After this happened, I throw away this stroller and STRONGLY advise against buying this for your children. It was a nightmare for me and I have never felt so strongly about a product. DO NOT RISK YOUR CHILDRENS SAFETY"
4,Great when the new baby is little,"I bought this stroller when I was pregnant for my 2nd child. My older son was 12 months when she was born. It came in handy at first... especially since I couldn't get one of those sit and stand strollers b/c my son was too little.One problem I had was the graco infant seat we had was sometimes hard to get out... once I came very close to hitting my son's head (he was sitting in the front seat).Another is once my daughter was old enough (5 months) she would scream b/c she didn't want to be in the infant seat and she couldn't see over my son's head when in the backseat. If we tried putting him the back he would kick the front seat.And last but not least it is bulky. I have an Xterra and it takes up most of the back.We know have the in-step double jogging stroller. They love it but I miss the parent tray.Overall it was good when I had one in the infant carrier but now she is 7 months, can sit up and weighs 20 pounds it just sits in our storage unit."
5,ALWAYS AMAZING,"I have been listening to Eleventeen since before they released their first album, and this new album just adds how amazing they are and how awesome their music is. yay eleventeen!"
5,Absolutely amazing band!!!!!,I just saw this band on a side stage at the warped tour...they were soooooo AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG imediately after i saw them i had to go to their stand and pick up their cd...when i got there the lead singer was there and signed the cd he was soooo extremely nice...and actually thanked me for checking them out...they r just an awsome band and this cd is a must have for ANYONE no matter what kind of music you like!!!!!
2,SO not worth it...,"I bought this tv so my younger son could have his own TV to watch his dvds and cartoons on..well, turns out, you have to buy an antenna and everything to get any kind of channels. I couldn't even get the tv to turn to channel 3 so he could watch his DVD..EVEN with the remote. Don't even bother wasting your time."
2,Don't be misled!,"Even if you're a computer geek (as I sorta am), if you haven't worked with CAD programs, don't think that this'll allow you to draw a 2-D pentagon within a few hours. (Yes, I meant, not even hours.) There's a requirement to relearn everything your brain ever thought it learned at age five about drawing even a line. I'm not knocking this particular software; I'm just saying that if you have an image in your mind that you want to get on paper in a structured way, and you think this program will help you -- an inexperienced CAD user -- it ain't gonna happen any time soon. Unfortunately, there really doesn't appear to be any other software that would serve that purpose efficiently. Only positive note: user forum is terrific -- but still insufficient to get the job done in a reasonable time frame."
1,Concert/Beach Chair,"I used chair at smooth jazz concert in Apr 08. Chair was very comfortable and shoulder strap was a very handy feature. The armrests on this chair are a safety hazard. I came very close to cutting off the tip of my baby finger. Be very careful when sitting down in chair, ensure armrests are locked in place so they do not crimp your fingers. I almost ruined my whole day at concert. My finger got crimped by metal armrest lock down fixture and I was in pain the whole day. Other than this problem I love the chair and rate it an excellant purchase. After using this chair 3 times in 2 years ths fabric is already beginning to come a loose at the seams. I have this chair ""ear marked"" for ""Salvation Army"" on my next trip. This has turned out to be one of my worst Amazon purchases."
5,Very enjoyable read.,"This is a fantastic book, 3rd. in the Brand family saga. As each story is told, we learn more about the Brands, which is fabulous, but without loosing anything about the main couple in each story.Wes is a half brother to the rest of the Brands. Their father had an affair with Wes's mother a Comanche. Wes was bought into the family by his stepmother when his own died & made to feel a part of the family. But for a long time there was something missing & that was his heritage.Taylor, like Wes was not bought up in the way of the Comanche. She was adopted when her mother died & bought up with white Americans. Wes & Taylor learn about their heritage with a Comanche shaman, Turtle.This is turning into one fantastic series of books the more I read each new one. Next is book 4 Ben & Penny's story in ""The husband she couldn't remember""."
4,good unit,"I run this unit with the PC FC350 frame gun and I also use it with my Senco SNC40 trim gun . It powers them nicely .Caution ; DO NOT use extension cords on units that have 2 pole ,3450 rpm motors as they are sensitive to voltage drops . The start capacitor will starve and the unit will appear broken.Use longer hoses instead , ( I use swivels between hoses and at the nail gun). It reduces tangles."
5,portercable compressor,This is a very good air compressor. I run multi-equipment from my air compressor every day. I am a contractor so my tools get much abuse. I will buy another porter cable compressor just like the one I have now but it still works like brand new so I dont see having to replace it in the near future. Thank You
3,"It's a keeper - no more, no less",The cons:-came with one defective quick connect - easily replaceable;-it's pretty friggin' heavy to lug around. The pancake is easier to haul for finishing jobs.-You better have it plugged to a 20 and not a 15 on the box or your going to be wearing out your Nikes running back and forth resetting the breakers.The Pros:-It's reliable-It handles two nailers simultaneously without running continuously
4,"A powerful ,compact compressor/reasonably priced!!!","I purchased this compressor for my crew of six men after I read the other reviews on the tool crib website. I am very impressed with the capabilities of this lightweight/powerful and relatively inexpensive compressor. As with all Porter Cable tools it is well designed, strongly constructed and built to LAST !! I especially like the two built in quick connects and the power to run two framing nailers at once from a small and easily transportable package. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a powerful, compact and one man transportable compressor. Three cheers and a Hoopla to Porter Cable on this one..."
1,Not good for heavy laptops,"This laptop riser might be good for lightweight laptops but it could not handle my heavy Lenovo. The flimsy plastic would not hold my laptop up to the highest level. The front plastic piece is not sturdy either. Overall, it's a very cheap product. Do not buy this if you have a heavy laptop."
5,EXCELLENT,This is an EXCELLENT and incredibly useful tool! The best non-electronic dictionary on the market!
2,A big no no..... ALMOST NO PICS,I have to disagree with the other reviewers. As someone just trying to learn how to apply makeup I didn't find this book helpful at all. I especially didn't like the use of drawings instead of pics. You can draw whatever you like but it's not the same as looking at a pic of someone who is supposed to have small close set eyes... you all know what I mean. I don't think this is a good book for the novice and that includes the skin care tips. Wash your face twice a day and don't use drying products. There that should take care of the cleansing routine and I have saved you some money to boot..... I expected better than this.
3,"Good information, but not very good visually","Large color photographs would have really helped this book. The graphics are mostly black and white, and they are not as good for teaching as a series of good color photos would be. That's a shame, because the book presents good information for most age groups."
2,Just Not Tough,"I really liked the idea, but there are some weak points in the design that are catastrophic. For example, there is a tiny plastic tab that locks the ring that clips above the cable plug; it breaks easily. Also, the small plastic ring around barrel that tightens the plug against the device will not stand any hard service. Drag it across hard ground, and it will open up. And, for heaven's sake, do not step on it!This is a great idea, but it is not up to the task of professional work or heavy field service: contractor, construction, welding (what I do), etc."
5,Wonderful to read and wonderful to cook from,"The New Doubleday Cookbook is a wonderful cookbook to read and to cook from as the recipes are well written, the book is well laid out, and the print is easy-to-read.You will literally find thousands of recipes in this cookbook, along with excellent directions, making the task of cooking so much easier.One of our favorite recipes, and one of the easiest, is the recipe for the seafood Cocktail Sauce. I make this all the time as why should I have to pay hard earned cash for something that is so easy to prepare. The recipe this cookbook uses includes ketchup, horseradish, lemon juice and Tabasco sauce to make up a tasty sauce for shrimp cocktail. The sauce is also good with fried shrimp or shrimp cocktail.Recommend."
4,A very reliable addition,"I originally wanted this to replace my older version of the same cookbook. I do like the updates, but I found myself using it to complement rather than replace. As for the vendor, I was quite pleased. I had to settle for a used copy, and this one was in as good a condition as they advertised."
2,Not a good value,"This CD is just 13 cuts from the Palomino Club Recordings that have been available for years on the Tomato record label.The complete Palomino Club Recordings can be purchased at this site, and you get all of the recordings not just 13. A Jerry Lee Lewis expert from Mineola NY."
3,woody wagon,"I liked this wagon, but it was very hard for my husband to put together (he owns his own metal shop so knows his way around tools) and the tires really stank. I don't know if they still stink after 1 year (I hope not). I got this for my granddaughter because my kids loved their wagon. My daughter -in-law wanted the rubber, inflatable tires. I like the hard tires myself."
5,Sunday Nights at A.L. Gators,"I picked this CD up two winters ago at Coconuts (A Crofton MD joint on Rt 3). Dave Tieff was performing solo and it was a trip down memory lane.Ten years ago, I spent entirely too many Sunday nights at AL Gators in Pasadena taking in Laughing Colors shows. (Ironically, I think the place is a chain drug store now) Aside from the fact the band rocks, the creative lyrics of the more humorous songs kept me coming back. Most of those tunes are on this CD.My particular favorites are both versions of Don't Tell the CIA and the War on Drugs."
5,A MUST for every teen!,"I use this book as my text for my high school Teen Living classes. It says it like it is with very solid logic and reasoning. It covers just about every topic affecting teens today from money to sex. It says what most parents want to say, but coming from a book makes it more digestible for the average teen."
2,"The ""money really matters"" part is great","But I'd recommend skipping the rest of the book. Pretty much a lily-white suburban strip mall Protestant Christian viewpoint for the most part.The part about money is outstanding. Maybe kids will understand that even a breadwinner father with a 75,000 a year job can't afford to live extravegantly and have much disposable income."
2,Teenager's Guide,"Book is REALLY wordy, not real conducive to a teenager. Was not really what I was hoping for."
1,Not good,"Many parents search for keys to make their children successful. It is unwise to think a book will do the trick, as many textbooks go unread.I was sent to this book by a co-worker who had many problems with both his children and his step-children. He confirmed that it was the be-all-end-all. All his children were encouraged to read it.5 months later, he was a grandfather for the 3rd time by his 17 year old daughter.There is extensive evidence that parents are the single most important infuence on a young persons' life, yet many adults are in denial about this and choose to blame society in general or the kids themselves.Many (not all) difficulties can be dealt with by communication and ""getting real"" with their kids instead of denial.Some families will be bettered by this book.I think it would best be read by both child and parent with open discussion about the issues it presents."
4,"Good TV, but for $1250?","I've been doing a lot of research lately in looking for TV's. This is definitely a good TV. CRT HDTV's are still comparable to the upper end of the LCD's today. Sony is definitely a top-end brand, so you're sure to get a good product with this TV.BUT, why is it priced at $1,250? This doesn't seem to include shipping cost which could easily exceed $200. There are LCD TVs that are just as capable and have the same screen size as this one for around 700-800 dollars. This would be a rational price if the year was 2006, just before the CRT HDTVs were discontinued.CRT TV's are long-lasting, so buying a used CRT HDTV isn't too risky. It's easy to find a TV as good as this one, used, for around 300-400 dollars.Also notice that the reviews posted on the front page were written in 2005."
5,Great Book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot is really easy to follow and the characters are great. This should be an Oprah pick.
4,High Scool Revenge,"Filomena Cromwell returns to her old stomping grounds after the humiliation of being a 19 year old who finds her fiancee in bed with another woman. The old Filomena was shy. Nine years later, she returns as a sucessful and flamboyant clothing manufacturer. She returns in designer clothes and a Porsche and intends to exact revenge on her ex.At her parent's lakeside resort, she meets Trent Ravinder and falls ""in love with the big ape"".There were many moments in this early Krentz novel that reveal her wicked sense of humor. Based on the era it was written - the 1980's - Fil reflects the new ""modern"" woman and her liberation is reflective of that time.If you enjoy a Krentz novel - you'll enjoy this one!"
2,Silly story,Didn't like the hero or the heroine or the story! I wonder why I even finished???? and really wonder why I bought it.
3,"Love, Romance, Humor","I loved the humorous banter between Filomena and Trent. He's a ""big buffalo"" and she doesn't like people ""looming over"" her. I read this book several times and laughed every time."
2,another lame covers album,"i'm a jimmie dale gilmore fan. i've seen him a few times in concert and own all his albums plus those by the other flatlanders (joe ely and butch hancock). but i found this one of gilmore's least satisfying albums. it feels like a holding pattern until he gets some new material. and, frankly, he doesn't tackle these covers with enough panache. they all sound like filler."
1,One Endless Bore . . .,Extremely boring and lifeless performances. It is hard to believe that this album is receiving accolades with songwriting this week. Cliche driven and uninspired. This one lives on reputation. And I am a big Buddy Miller fan -- but his production on this one can't save an all-around week effort.
5,Rocky gives it a 5 Star,"I have an amazon parrot named Rocky. When I play Jimmie Dale's ""One Endless Night"" CD, Rocky stops dead in his tracks and listens fixated, like I do. This is an EXCELLENT album. I never heard of JD before but Amazon.com pushed a recommendation to me and I tried it. I will buy the rest of Jimmies albums as a result.I work in a place you could call cubicle city. You have to listen to music with head phones so as not to bother your fellow cubicle prisoners. I have been asked by people 5 cublicles away to stop humming. I'm sure I will hear something official from HR about not humming. You can not help but sing along and foot tap with this album. Good job, Jimmie!"
4,found by accident/love it,"I'm a world beat fan, but sometimes on my fav public radio station they'll play something different just to shake you up (or stop you from shaking) and they played Gilmore's cover of Mack the Knife. Wow. Stopped me in my tracks (well, I was actually driving the 405 passing West Hollywood). I felt like I was listening to a ghost story; his version is so far from the usual pop or Broadway take on this song, that I wondered if he had rewritten it. But no. The rest of the album is probably more intended for afficianados of folk/country, but I came away with a lot of respect for his work in this genre. Didn't realize how closed-minded I'd been."
5,One Endless Night,"This is the music that shakes us from the endless procession of ""generic country"" that parades across the airwaves. Gilmore is an example of the time when fans could identify which artist by the sound of his voice. There isn't a bad cut on this CD. This is music for anyone who likes the best."
5,One Endless Night,I love this album! Jimmy Dale Gilmore has become my favorite singer-songwriter and I can't quit listening...now...if I could just find him on tour...
5,SUPER FAST SHIPPING,"The cd was as advertised, and the shipping was super fast. I would buy from this seller again."
4,"Jimmie Dale's ""One Endless Night"" doesn't need to end......","Jimmie Dale Gilmore's ""One Endless Night"" is a true fan's delight - traditional country with a philosophical and stylistic twist. It's a well-produced album with outstanding, heart-felt vocals that pierce the soul and great tunes from himself, Townes Van Zandt, Jesse Winchester, John Hiatt, and his lifelong Flatlander buddy, Butch Hancock, just to name a few. This is proof that there IS an alternative to Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, and the Dixie Chicks....There are several highlights: the rockabilly blues of the bonus track ""D.F.W. (Dallas-Ft. Worth)""; ""Ripple""; ""No Lonesome Tune""; ""Ramblin' Man""; ""Down by the Banks of the Guadaloupe"" and ""Goodbye Old Missoula."" Note to Gilmore fans: ""Ramblin' Man"" and ""Down by the Banks of the Guadaloupe"" appear on Jimmie and Butch Hancock's ""Two Roads: Live in Australia"" CD - an import, all acoustic collection from a few years ago."
4,Good Book Until it Ended,The first book in Al Lacy's Battles of Destiny Series is primarily about 2 families (the Steeles and Ruffins) and their slaves in the South. Web Steele is engaged to be married to Abby Ruffin. The story begins long before the actual war begins. There wasn't as much war action as I was expecting which for me is actually better.A Promise Unbroken is very good and very easy to follow. The characters tales take so many twists and turns the reader is always wondering what will happen. This seems to be the type of series you have to read every book to know what happens. I was disappointed in the way the first book ended. The second book doesn't pick up where A Promise Unbroken ends.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical fiction with a glimmer of romance and wants to be spared the gory details of war.
3,Informational yet very low production values,"This is nothing more than someone videotaping his presentation at some event, then transferring it to DVD. Production values are terrible. That said, some of the information is quite interesting and some is new (to me, at least). So, three stars. Suggest Bill Knell spend a little more time and money on the next production."
5,fits the purpose,"I found this item in a local store. The moment i saw it i was sold. It was well made, light weight, not too many nor too little compartments. It also can keep a reasonable amount of items such as passport, credit card, cash, etc and they are safe with you whenever you go. I haven't had chance to go through airport security yet. I am curious to know if it will be noticed or asked taken off when i pass the security screening process. Hopefully, no one will bother me with it at the security checking point. i am really glad that i found this belt."
1,NOT helpful!,"This book is entirely useless as a means of starting your own child care business. Any useful information was so bogged down with ""true stories"", grammatical errors, and religious advice that it was impossible to find. The ""girlfriend"" tone Dr. Simmons used becomes tiresome after the first two pages.I was also highly insulted by the section entitled ""The Main Reason Why We Do This Every Day,"" which depicted a large pile of money. Some of us are not in the CHILD care business just for the bucks! I would have liked more tips on daily activities for the children, and less advice on collection agencies."
5,A Daycare Provider Must Have,"This book was superb when I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It seemed like every topic she addressed I was experiencing. Needless to say, I restructured my contract around her examples. It has helped me out tremendously, now I don't feel so bad because I am not the only one going through things as a daycare provider. To be honest I was seriously thinking about throwing in the towel until I read this book."
5,"Ahhhh, Barney Beagle!!!!","I remember this book from my childhood reading days. The images are still with me. Imagine my surprise when I realized the pictures were in black and white, and basically line drawings! :) Wonderful story, I plan on saving this for my grandchildren. Delighted to find it here, and definately worth the buy!"
5,Still Making Kids Happy,"This has to be my favorite childhood book. Recently I decided to read my old copy to a little girl with severe ADHD and abandonment issues. She not only listened attentively to the story, but asked me to read it to her again as soon as I had finished. The story of the little dog who desperately wants a boy of his own really touched her and she requested that story be read every evening that she was in my care. I hope they bring this book back into print - my copy is torn and battered. I would love to have a new one ready for when I become a grandmother!"
3,Never received item-received rebate,"I was disappointed not to receive this item. It was my childhood favorite book and the teachers in my building were sharing their favorite books. When I contacted the seller to say that I hadn't received the item, I was given a rebate almost immediately with the explanation that rarely the post office loses things. I told the seller why I wanted the item in hopes that they had another item and I got no response, just the rebate and a request for positive feedback. Thinking that this was the right thing to do, I did without a second thought, afterall I did get a fast refund. Later while looking for this book again, I could see that the seller did indeed have this title and was selling it with the same description for a higher dollar amount. I am very disapponted. (sad)"
5,Love this book!,"I remember my daddy reading this to me when I was very young. Then I would read it to him. This is a wonderful book, I read this to my children when they were little, but alas, the book disappeared. I have been looking for it for a very long time now. I was so pleased to see it again. I plan to get this and then give it to my grandchildren for their children. Wonderful memories, delightful story and it will warm your heart everytime you read it. I recommend that they bring this back into publication for all of the future generations to come."
5,Enlightening,"I just read this book recently (summer of 2001). Its main purpose was to prepare you for the 2000 election and what we'd be getting if Al Gore won the presidential election. As I was reading it, however, Gore has tentatively hinted another run in '04. Bearing that in mind, I still think this book is informative and necessary to all who might consider voting for Gore and any who might still wish he became the president last election.Many had imagined Gore to be the better half of the Clinton/Gore team. He certainly projected that wholesome image that Clinton could never pull off. However, this book looks beneath his veneer of respectability and exposes his shady land dealing and utter hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.As it says in the forward, Bossie and Brown strive to be as accurate as is humanly possible. I am greatful to these two men for giving a history of Gore's life for me, as I knew little of his past.Get yourself a copy of this book, it is very informative."
1,BUllSH**,"don't waste a minute with this moral majority TRASH. it's sad to live in a country where brains don't net you a thing...votes, respect, the right to preside over the MAJORITY who voted you in as president."
1,Too Biased To Be Accurate,"Historically and hysterically inaccurate. Having been a part of the 60's generation there is plenty of blame to go around about the longevity of the Vietnam war. The author totally blames the Democrats. That is biased reporting. As I recall, there were hawkish Republicans advocating to increase the bombing of Vietnam. The Vietnam war was unwinnable. The French learned that lesson and the US learned this lesson too late. This unfair treatment of Al Gore, Jr. has only convinced me even more to vote for Al Gore, Jr."
4,truth and consequences,"A long review is not needed--just realize that the truths documented and uncovered will be dodged by all liberals in all circles. They will complain about this book,but they'll read it, and then some will look inside themselves and realize that they, too, would do anything to advance themselves. BUT, not enough will be ashamed. A real eye opener in self examination for those who choose to vote for Gore. Will they be able to sleep?"
5,Heart Land - Tim Grimm,"Tim Grimm is an excellent singer/songwriter. He has a great knack for telling a story through music. He also would be a good choice to see in concert, though he mostly tours in Indiana. You might also look for him in one of your favorite movies."
3,"When she was good, she was very, very good...","If you don't know Claire's music, this is not really the one to try first; it's the least typical. That said, if you love her music, don't miss it.I could have lived the rest of my years without hearing 'Come Along Brave Lads' or 'Ultra-Violet Light', but life would have been less fulfilling without 'The Moon is a Powerful Lover'. That song is very special indeed.As for the album, Gary Numan guests on it, which gives you a feel for the style. Early 80's sound, but Claire is unable to hide her talent even under the wrong arrangements.Three stars because it's patchy, but the good bits are just great."
3,Good,Claire Hamill's best recordings are from the early seventies. Go to Voiceprint.com and order One House Left Standing and October. You will be pleasantly surprised.
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid","What are you people, on crack. This was the worst piece of crap game I have ever played.The menus go 800 miles an hour making it impossible to do what you want. The graphics suck and when I die with no X-Men and I havent saved the game I have to start from the beginning. Mark my words, It SUCKS"
1,Rent...don't buy this gaem,Its nice to rent if you are saving up for a good game. I wouldn't invest in this game as the graphics are cartoony. The only good thing is mid mission if you find an extraction point you can change characters. But the game play is nothing like advertised on the TV. Save your dough for a good game and rent this on a rainy day!!!!!!
4,Fun little game,I haven't played video games for many years. The last video game I played was the Ultimate Alliance series but before that...I think it was Sega Genesis. I liked this game because it isn't overwhelmingly difficult. It's just a player's game. There were points where I got lost but I enjoyed playing it.
4,X-review,"This game is the best X-Men game yet! Not only can you choose four from a selection of 15 of X-Men to play as, (you have to unlock them to do so) but you can also play as enemies you have beaten, in the danger room! You can get there from the main menu. It also often requiers a lot of strategy and planning."
4,Player,"I wasn't sure what to expected when i got this game for christmas, but when i started playing it, i couldn't stop. The effects of the game were great. I found the game challangeing. The hardest part for finding the crew members on the ship. I like the fact that you don't have to play as one x-men but with a group of x-men. The only problem i had with this game was all of the loading. I felt like i spent more time waiting for it to load then i did playing the game.The game tries to keep with the story line of the comic book. Magneto breakes out to destroy the earth and the only ones who can stop him are the x-men. The game is great for anyone who like to play long games or just enjoyed reading the x-men comics."
1,Returning Women to their Proper Place: Serving Men,"Wendy Straker's book MEN AT WORK is just another neo-etiquette book for women that teaches them how to be accomodating.Get a blackberry so you can play on yours while he plays with his? How is this different from books like The Rules which tell you to take up golf so you can find a husband/maintain a relationship? It's not. It's just another sexist book dressed in girl power clothing.Women work too--not just writing demeaning books, but in the same careers Straker spends so much time telling us how to accomodate.Perhaps the solution is to find a partner with whom you can communicate about the demands of your respective careers. Not just accomodate his.Wonder what would happen if women put as much energy into their careers as they do into figuring out how to ""read"" a guy through his...Put down this book, pick up FEMALE CHAUVANIST PIGS by Arielle Levy and focus on YOUR life and career so you can be Mr. Right's partner instead of his Stepford Wife."
5,Leather Fringe Purse,"This item that I bought was a gift for a friend of mine.When she opened it up she was quite surprised to see such a beautiful purse,(she loved it)You could smell the genuine leather,it came all boxed up very neatly!It also had a roomy interior,which my friend loved.She takes it just about everywhere she goes,I'm glad to say that I will do more bussiness with Amazon,I trust them highly,and their prices are Terriffic! It did not take that long to get here,either,had it before the holidays arrived,it was very fast and secure! Thank You for your bussiness!"
4,THIS SONG IS CLASSIC WEST COAST,"FIRST OFF NOT TO MANY PEOPLE REMEMBER THIS CLASSIC WEST COAST ARTIST OR SONG. HIS VOICE SOUNDED ALOT LIKE Q-TIP, BUT HE WAS FROM THE WEST. THE SONG IS ABOUT A 1964 CHEVY IMPALA, AND ITS HOT. THE PRODUCTION WAS GREAT. LA NASH WAS ON MENES RECORDS IN 1995, BUT HASNT BEEN HEARD OF SINCE. I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS SONG."
1,Jump-o-lene,"Huge waste of money. Thought this would be great for my 2 yr old, she has a winter birthday, & getting outside enough to wear her out this time of year is not easy. She loved it when it actually held air, but that didn't last long. Went thru the patches quickly, & eventually ended up with holes in every section. What a total disappointment."
4,Best post-Jaco effort?,"Sportin Life was good too, but this had some good stuff on it. Victor Bailey had replaced Jaco, and at the time Victor made much of Zawinul telling him to lay back at the sessions, as Jaco was such a strong voice and Zawinul wanted a little more space. Bailey went around for a year saying he was much better than this etc...well to my ears he's pretty damn good. I will say my favourite cut is Molasses Run becuase Zawinul's solo is so...angular. Omar Hakim is the guitarist (for the reviewer who was asking). Not the best WR album but some fine moments."
4,hidden treasure,one of those over-looked gems in the true weather vane tradition hypnotic well played grooves that reward the listener time after time memorable tunes great solos i think a must for any weather fan
2,Disc error . . .,"The one we bought has trouble reading discs and we frequently get a disc error message. Usually we can get the thing to play if we open and close the drawer enough times. The last DVD we tried to play it would not recognize at all. We've had it less than a year but we're fed up and going to replace it. It's very pretty and slim, however . . ."
1,Disc error,"I bought this unit to replace an old CD player which had given up the ghost. I took a look at what was around - I don't want a 200-CD jukebox - just a simple player. This thing was really inexpensive and since I've had Kenwood equipment for about 15 years, I thought I could trust the brand. Even though it is listed as a CD/DVD player, this unit however didn't recognize most of the CDs I put in, showing the message ""Disc Error"". One CD played for about a minute, then ejected itself, then wouldn't play at all. I took it back to the store and tried another one, but had the same problem. The guy tried to sell me a much more expensive player, but this experience put me off Kenwood. I got my money back."
1,lovely10,i never knew anyone who had a problem liking themselves. as humans we are infatuated with ourselves. it seems it would be a much more efficient use of priceless time and energy to write a book over learning how to like other people
4,Amazed more as weeks pass on,"Coming from a basic refractor, every time I turn on my new Celestron NexStar 8 SE I feel like a kid ready to discover something new from my location. The scope's portability and neat image, specially with my new set of lenses and filters, also by Celestron, make a it nightly joy to gaze above. As weeks pass on, I am amazed more and more at observing the beautiful creation within our human reach."
4,Celestron's NextStar 8 SE,"Not sure if I should be reviewing it this soon, as there is definitely a learning curve involved. But, after a few sessions of stargazing, I believe the computer speed is about half of optimum. Either that, or a bigger text display is in order. I'm left waiting for the alignment message to be displayed, and waiting, and waiting. The tube optics are good, however the eyepiece FOV is limited. I replaced the eyepiece with one with a wider FOV and was able to align much easier. A Telrad will likely help the alignment, too. After all that, I still would recommend it and would buy it again if I had it to do over."
2,Celestron Customer Service,"While the Celestron 8SE is an easy telescope to set up, and moderately easy to use the company customer service leaves much to be desired. The scope I received lasted 3 days before the hand controller failed. After never receiving any email responses to web requests for customer service I called. they agreed that the hand controller failed (I saw many discussions of this on the web). They wanted me to send it in as well as the rest of the mount. I paid more than $100 to overnight the unit to Celestron and after 5 days of silence I called and they said it was their policy to have a 30 day repair time for warranty. Several email queries to status havegone unanswered.The customer service and turnaround times for repairs under warranty are excessive and the company has no sense of urgency that you spent thousands and are sitting with a useless piece of equipment after 1 week of use."
5,"Excellent, except...","I have a professional degree in astronomy before turning to medicine. I also have over 40 years of observing experience. This is a wonderful off-the-shelf telescope for the amateur observer who is mainly interested in visual observing. Optical and mechanical quality and image stability are excellent. I use a digital camera with it for planetary and lunar work, but I don't do deep-sky photography. This type of alt-azimuth drive/mount is not really designed for serious deep-sky photography, but it is terrific for visual observing. My only complaint is that it does not have an onboard memory clock, so the time, date, and location must be re-entered with each use. That is a crazy software design. The other complaint is that the unit I have does not know about the change in daylight savings time dates that was made last year. It is a small hassle, but a hassle nonetheless."
2,nice telescope many problems,"over all I am not very pleased with this telescope. For the price, it is loud, the viewfinder will not stay attached, and the viewfinder is very cheaply made. I cannot get the telescope to focus on things like the moon, so I am having sever problems with the unit over all. I am in the process of trying to get ahold of Celestron, but with my experiences, I would recommend an Orion over theses.Main problems:1. Viewfinder stinks, it will not stay attached, is cheaply made. My thinking is to try using plumbers tape to try and get this to attach properly.2. Telescope to stand--very cheaply made, is very touchy, Make sure you have multiple people there with you to attach, if you don't there is a good chance the telescope will slide right off the mount.I will keep this updated as I get the unit up and running properly."
2,Overpriced Junk,"Horrible instructions. Sky align feature is anything but easy. Every time I try to align it I get the message ""alignment failed stars not in database"". Their adds claim find any three stars and even bright planets. You have to re-enter the time every time you turn the control on. What is this the 18th century. Tech support is closed when you really need them like during the nigh-time hours when you are using the scope. On the plus side extremely easy to set up. Nice tripod."
1,You are misslead,"Dear friend;With disappointment and after more than 10 times to do the set up and follow the manual instruction, this kind of telescope is more complicated than every body things.Even watching the tutorial videos, that looked easy it is not.I Strongly do not recommend to purchase this kind of telescope, you will end up frustrateRegardsWilli"
3,Its Ok but could be better.,"I got this car seat as a gift from my sister (and I'm grateful for it) but the fabric could be better. It feels like plastic, is not comfortable. Also the canopy does not extend enough to block the sun. It's not attached to the back of the car seat, so every time I extend it, the back side also moves! Its annoying... Looks beautiful, but I was expecting more from GRACO."
5,Love the Snugride,"I agree with the other reviews - we love this seat. It's comfy and secure, and you can pop it in and out of the car without waking the baby up...what more can I say?"
1,Cannot be made secure,"After seeing the latest Consumer Reports article on infant car seats, I immediately replaced my Britax Companion with a Graco Snugfit. The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it. No matter how tight I got the straps attached to the LATCH in my 2006 Honda Odyssey, I could still flip the seat up and side to side with very little effort. For now, I'm sticking with the Britax."
2,Only adjusts from back!,"I owned an older Graco carseat with my first child but wanted a newer one for the new baby. Up to this point, I've been a huge fan of Graco products! I received this carseat as a gift and set it aside until the baby arrived. I didn't realize that the front adjust wasn't a standard feature on all car seats. This carseat only allows you to adjust the straps from behind the seat which is a pain for two reasons: 1) trying to get the straps even on both shoulders, and 2) the time and effort it takes to loosen and tighten the straps is very inconvenient when you're trying to buckle the little one in. Very frustrating product but safety wise, it is good (hence the two stars)."
2,Does not have a Front adjustment,"The description of this car seat is wrong. The car seat does not have front adjustment. I have two children and a third on the way. I have own several car seats. The ones that guarantee a proper fit are easy to adjust. In order to adjust this car seat you will have to adjust each strap individually from the back, this is extremely inconvenient. If you order this product from Amazon demand that they replace it with a front adjustment car as indicated in the description that they provided."
5,great item for the price!,When the handle started to go on our old Graco seat (this is our third baby) we started looking around for a replacement. I wanted something more feminine since people kept thinking my daughter was a boy because her car seat was a blue plaid but all we could find was bright pink. I saw this at a locally owned baby store and loved it. However they wanted a lot more for it and were not willing to budge on the price. Ordered it on Amazon and got free shipping - What a deal!! It came within a few days and was in perfect condition. I love that the handle has two positions and the canopy is much less flimsy than our old one. Definitely recommend this product.
2,NOT EASY TO ADJUST,"In order to tighten or loosen the harness straps, you have to pull one at a time from the back of the seat using a buckle. NO THANKS!!"
4,"Good, but could use improvements.","It's a great seat, rated the best by most reviews, and is really the best way to go in combination with a stroller frame like the Graco Snugrider, since the combination will be lighter then standard full size strollers + infant seat..However, as previously mentioned, I have to agree with the head rest being a safety hazard from the fact it has the padding fabric the baby can easily grab and handful and stick in their mouth..the headrest is pretty flimsy and too big for infants (offers no real support) so best to simply replace it with one of the way better headrests that are available on the market (and don't cause a major chocking hazard such as this one...Also, if I were to do it again, I would choose the Graco SafeSeat Step1 because it can still go on a stroller frame like the SnugRider, but it can handle your baby for a lot longer (i.e. 30 pounds and 32 inches instead of 22 pounds and 29 inches for the Snugride)."
2,Cute.. but you get what you pay for.,"yes it's cute and pink, but for 60 bucks, that's basically the quality your getting, Well at least the one I purchased.the buttons that you depress to put the handle back or forward barely work, the cloth is always falling off and not staying still..i shouldn't complain, but it's really cheap compared to the other graco carseats."
4,Infant Carseat-Graco Snugride,"I really liked getting a carseat that matched the print on our stroller. The assembly was really easy when it came in the mail. It also came with the base for the car and seatbelt hookup. The clip that holds that carseat is hard to get right, but that will be the same with any carseat you buy. It does come with a strap to actually hook in between the seats and that's a lot easier to use. It's lightweight, so carrying my sleeping infant in it to or from the car is easy. My only complaint is that there is not a lot of padding on the seat and it felt really uncomfortable. So I took the cover off and put a knitted baby blanket in under the cover for extra padding. My kiddo goes everywhere in his carseat and loves it."
2,Thought it was a great seat..but was wrong,"I looked and tried out several seats before purchasing this one for my fourth baby. My other three used the same infant carrier but this time around we needed something new. I was so excited when I found it at a great price and pattern I really liked. The strap adjustments were easy to do which was an added bonus from my first graco 8 years ago..that is the strap height adjustments, not the tightening ones. BUT luckily I tried it all out once I got home. There is no way to make it loosen without adjusting it from the back. The other one I owned had a button that went inbetween babies legs that allowed you to loosen/tighten the straps. This one only had things in the back to loosen it..COMPLETELY DIFFICULT to do with a baby in your arms. So..I will be returning this seat in the morning!"
2,horrible seat great customer service,I purchased this car seat after months of researching looking for a seat that was safe and affordable. It was a mistake. The car seat came and the canopy was all ripped. The fabric on the seat itself was cheap looking and had no way of hooking on the seat as other car seats do.The customer service was wonderful and I returned it the same day. But if you are looking for a decent car seat at a fair price I would not recommend this one. (It also had very little padding and was not easy to move the handle up and down on it)
2,Snugride2 was a Snugride,"I was disappointed to find that the Snugride2 that was advertised was not what arrived on the doorstep. Although shipping was prompt and the item arrived in undamaged condition it was not what I thought it would be. I read in another rating that it wasn't the first time this item was not as advertised. So although I am sure this is adequate and will serve you well, if you want the Snugride2 buy in a store where you can see what you are getting before money is exchanged. Otherwise expewct to spend time exchanging it or do as I am chaulk it up to bad luck!"
2,Strapping in the child feature is extremely inconvenient and impractical - BEWARE!,"We recently bought this car seat without knowing that Graco car seats actually have 2 different kinds of methods of tightening the baby seat belt in the car seat. We found that this particular colour that we bought Tango, you had to place the child in the seat, tilt the car seat forward, all the while making sure to hold the child in the seat so that he does not fall out, tighten the belt from the back of the car seat before the belt is tight enough to be used. There is the other type of car seat where there is a strap at the bottom where you can simply just pull to tighten. I do not know why Graco is still circulating car seats that has the extremely impractical and inconvenient model. In the end we returned this seat to Amazon, and went to Babies R US to view the right model and bought from there. We ended up paying a cheaper price as well."
3,Not the quite the carseat advertised,"I was hoping to find an infant carseat that fit babies up to 30 pounds so that I did not have to buy a middle-sized carseat before moving up to the booster/toddler carseat that I already own.This carseat, when shipped, was not the Graco Snugride 2, as advertised, and does not go up to 30 pounds as it says in the product description. It is just the Graco Snugride. It only holds infants up to 22 pounds. I decided to keep it because it was hard to find an infant carseat that does go up to 30 pounds.I haven't used it yet except to fit it into the car, so can't say much beyond that. Just wanted to let those browsing this product know that it's not quite what it says it is."
3,Just OK,"My 9 month old (20 lbs and 26 inches) has already outgrown this car seat. He barely fits in the seat. I thought, based on the specs, that it would last longer. I think the height/weight specs are very misleading. I also find the mechanism for adjusting the length of the straps to be cumbersome if you have a small car like I do - I have to move the front seats in order to adjust the straps."
2,Not happy with fabric,"We initally loved this car seat, but once my baby turned 4 mo. old he hated it. We always wonder why, until we noticed, that after a 40 min. ride the head rest was wet, he was getting very hot in the seat due to the plastic material, I wouldn't buy this car seat if I had the choice again, go for something with breathable materials, cotton or something like that.. My son never got the seat dirty, so being plastic wasn't convenient."
2,Beware of contact dermatitis/baby rash,"Whereas I like the style of this carseat, my son (and my sister's son, one month younger) developed a terrible rash from skin contact to the fabric. I took my son to two dermatologists and two pediatricians before we found out this was what caused it. Once I covered up the car seat before putting him in, the rash disappeared. The pediatrician says it's likely due to the flame retardant chemicals they use on the fabric. Either way - spare your baby the topical steroids and numerous doctor's appointments, not to mention the painful looking rash and discomfort, and if you purchase this cover the fabric. A large pillowcase cut through for the straps works well."
3,Torn,"Ok, the Graco Snugride is an EXCELLENT car seat...I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safe infant seat. PLEASE do not spend your money on this fabric choice...It gets way too hot and baby is not comfortable in it. Definately get the snugride...just opt for a different fabric set.Gave 3 stars as, the seat itself is awesome...just not in ""Metropolitan""Graco has excellent customer service...I called to complain about it, and they sent me a new cover free of charge. So that tells me-- I was not the first to complain about it."
4,Great when they're little...,"This is fabulous for getting in and out of the car without disturbing the baby. It is somewhat cumbersome, however, to carry around without a stroller or grocery cart. It gets worse the heavier they get. Mine is already 18lbs at 3 months(!) so we are about to upgrade to a stay-in-the-car type of seat. But great fabric and great washability. Just be aware that your arm will break once they hit 15lbs!! :o)"
2,Anti Diva,"This book was interesting but didn't contain any information I didn't already know about the music scene in the 60s. Still, it's a good read."
2,Cutey Honey,"Cutey Honey-The live action movie is similar to most live action versions of manga or anime characters. They usually fall short of the original. It was decent and had high production values, but the humor doesn't always translate well to american audiences. The action is similar to the stuff you would see in the Adam West Batman Television series or movie. I would only suggest you pick this up, if you're a fanboy like myself."
4,Worthwhile blueray to own,"Although this partiuar version of SHE was not the one I thought it was , I still enjoyed it ,I was looking for the Ursila Andris version. Color seemed very natual for a colorized film, Print was in good shape as well nice image, The other Film was unusual as well, never heard iof it before, All in all A good Blueray."
1,Don't bother unless you must,"I needed to install this OS to get the greatest ""benefit"" from a new system I built for my wife. She uses Photoshop and needed the hottest hardware. I built a dual core AMD 64 bit system with 2G of RAM and installed Vista. It was very difficult to get used to and ultimately I had to disable the application filtering. I have converted all my other computers in the house to Linux - simplyMEPIS. Don't upgrade to Vista unless you have no choice. It is painful."
1,paranoid,"Vista finds everything strange and suspicious, even other microsoft products. Even word documents you wrote yourself will not load without permission being given by a supervisor (I forget the exact title they use) even when you are the only one who uses the computer. You have to do virus checks et al several times a day even if your computer (like mine) is not connected to the internet. It constantly runs programs without asking if you want them or telling you they are running. and then turning the computer off when the program you aren't using turns itself off. Although it is supposed to be compatable with XP programs, it crashes the computer 1/3 of the time if you try to load one. The ones it will run, run at half the screen size. Even programs on your hard drive are pronounced strange and unknown if you dare to try to use them."
2,RIP-OFF,"Well...let's face it, screwed again. Look this blinking product costs $159.99 upwards, but guess what? THIS IS A DVD>>>Not a CD. So, if you have a CPU sans dvd drive you are USC-WOP...because you have to go to the Windows Vista website and purchase for an additional $9.99 the CD's. Gee....what a crock! Also, the website has a glitch/bug in it, and you can only order the 64-bit DVD...not the 32-bit CD. To make matters worse, there is No One to contact for help, and the full left side of the page for shipping & billing info.is hidden behind a blank frame. If I ever get this loaded I might write another review.....but at this point in time, why bother?"
1,I am not a very happy student,"I bought this pre-installed on a HP AMD computer. I have had it for a year and a half and the entire OS CRASHED recently . I cannot boot it up past the password and I took it to an expert, and they said I have to erase the VISTA OS off the computer from scratch and reinstall the OS. NOT COOL! The other problem is that I can get safe mode to work (that is how I know it is not a virus,) but I cannot download the patch that could probably fix the simple problem! I awaiting another OS that is more compatible with an AMD. Please be cautious in purchasing this OS"
1,"All style, no substance","Bought a new laptop that came with Vista basic on it. I used it for about 15 minutes before I gave up and wiped the hard drive and installed XP. The pointless animations on every menu push the CPU to it's limits, leaving nothing left for, say, internet browsing, or solitaire, for that matter. What especially bugs me is that Vista has such a resemblance to Mac OSX. If I wanted a Mac operating system, I would buy a mac. But no, I guess Microsoft feels threatened, and decided to blend in with the opposition. Well guess what, it didn't work.Buy Windows XP instead, less flair, more function."
1,Flash Back To Windows ME,"This windows version is about as worthless as ME was. It came installed on my new computer and from day one was a problem. It isn't compatible with a large majority of hardware or software. It uses an enormous amount of system resources. I'm not a computer tech, but normally I can make a computer do what ever it is I'm wanting it to do, but with Vista I have run into nothing but problems and if you contact a computer tech with a problem and you tell them your operating system is Vista they automatically say variations of ""that's the problem"" and half the time they can't offer anything helpful because of the way Vista is set up to run. Do Not purchase!! If it comes installed on a computer you are purchasing invest in either a copy of Windows XP or an upgrade to Windows 7 at the time that you purchase the computer and save yourself a lot of frustration."
2,Purchase price is just the beginning,"Don't expect to use your old peripherals with Vista. It's very pretty but what a gimmick! Scanners, printers, camcorders, digital camera... worthless with Vista. Only a few peripherals and software are compatible with special tweeking and thanks to the internet and a few hours of scouring the web. Press the start button and Vista asks you to buy this program and that service. It'll nickle and dime you into the poor house. There's more to Vista than the purchase price."
1,The worst OS ever!. Thanks to Vista now I have a Mac,"The worst OS ever!. Thanks to Vista now I have a Mac and am extremely happy!Thank you Microsoft, now I know what is a great computer, a MAC!!!"
1,"Whatever you do, DON'T ""upgrade"" to this pile of %&#@!!!!","Pathetic performance, near-universal incompatibility with external applications and hardware, and nonexistent technical support; what more could anyone ask?If you've got Windows XP on your computer already, KEEP IT THERE. If you're getting a new computer, you need to consider buying a Mac (like I eventually did). No amount of tinkering by Microsoft is going to make Windows Vista worth the effort of learning.This is, without doubt, the techno-turkey of the decade."
1,"It is not compatible with Windows XP! And, it uses too much resources!","Windows Vista is horrible software. It should not even be called ""Windows"" because it is not based on Windows XP or 2000! While its graphical interface looks like XP's, Vista uses a different file system.SO, NO SOFTWARE THAT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP OR WINDOWS 2000 WILL WORK WITH VISTA.Not only that, but Microsoft chose graphics over functionality: Vista uses 500MB of memory just by itself. After adding Anti-Virus and other software, your computer's performance will grind to a halt."
1,Countdown Kids butcher childrens' songs,"This CD set contains many of the song titles you'll recall from childhood. The problem is, the song lyrics are inexplicably altered. For example, ""Twinkle twinkle little bat, how I wonder where you're at. Like a tea tray in the sky..."" I've never seen a bat twinkle, but then I've not seen many bats. My husband and I hate this CD set. But, it does quiet down our 18 month old daughter, perhaps because the music is sung by children."
4,Waiting for the big time,"About a year ago a song came on the radio as I drove through Abilene, Texas. It started simply and unpretentiously, but built into a rocking power ballad. I tried to identify the band, but quickly realized that I'd just never heard them before. There was no question in my mind- I had to find the CD. The song was ""Dashboard Mary"" by Podunk.There is no doubt in my mind that if these guys could find a broader audience then they would go to the big-time. Throwin' Bones is a very good album, and the band is certainly worthy of its constant comparisons to the Black Crowes. They remain slightly unpolished, but they are definitely a diamond in the rough.If you listen to the album, ""Dashboard Mary"" should be top priority, but don't miss out on ""Wings"", either. They are the two best songs on a solid disc."
3,better live,"theses guys are great live seen um with tesla but had never heard of them before, wow unreal they came very close to stealing the show, but the cds do not come close to the live sound and the best song live is not on there cds. rollin i think it was. i cant wait for the next cd i check in to see if its out. they kinda sound like tesla but more like a band called cry of love. i say buy there cds and if you get a chance to see um live lucky you."
4,Saw them live....bought the CD....am awaiting next release,"Saw them open for KX at Slim's in SF (The show with Ty Tabor in a cervical collar), and was very impressed. Sounds like the good songs from Tesla with more substance in the lyrics, some really solid musicianship, and a lot of energy. I love this album, and will definitely buy the next one. ""Wings"" is extremely cool."
4,Rock'n'Roll song writing craft,"I've recently heard Podunk live twice on the King's X tour. They were a pleasant surprise to say the least. These guys can play good solid rock (live and on CD) with top notch harmonies, great rhythm section. A two guitar band where the two players don't just play the same thing, they work their guitar parts with creativity and thought. Jason reminds me a little of Lowell George, with a harder sound. It's nice to hear new talent where the music comes first. A truely talented young song writer, arranger, singer and player. I really dig this album. Paul, if you read this, it's Bub."
4,Caught by surprise,"I recently saw Podunk open for King's X at Seattle's Ballard Firehouse. I had never heard of the group, and was expecting just more opening act filler. But from the very first chords, you could tell these guys were special. Podunk's 45-minute segment featured one good song after another, passionate playing from the two guitars, bass, and drums, and great vocals. The final number, Boomerang, with the Peter Frampton-styled voicebox jam, left me wondering where these guys came from. The answer is Port Arthur, Texas, also home to Janis Joplin. Well, move over Janis! I've since got the CD and it doesn't disappoint. Solid rock songs and perfect production. But if you get the chance, see them live. I don't think they'll be an opening act for long."
3,Not Quite up to Kravitz's standards,"I have to give credit to Lenny Kravitz for creating a good blend of soulful vocals and hard rock guitars, however, I wasnt too interested in most of the songs on the album. I found most to be kinda BAD. Fly away is good though.k"
2,How can anyone really like this s**t!!!???!!!,"One of the most embaressing things I have admitted in public is relevant... ok... here we go... I own Lenny Kravitz's album ""5"". I bought this cd when I was 15 and I tried to expand my taste into more mature music. But it sure didn't get any mature after buying this one!!! Ok, Lenny plays almost every instrument himself. SO WHAT!?! It's rather small credit compared to the fact that his songs are almost identical plagiations from the 70's disco, r&b and funk. Sheer dissappointment. The extra star goes to the merely interesting vision of the lyrics in ""Black Velveteen""... Stupid, stupid ..."
4,Excelent Hard Rock,"A very nice band from Europe, the new Hard Rock Craddle. This is the Cd that made Hardcore Superstar big. If you miss the 80's, get this now"
3,A nice hooray,"A lot of fluff with little acting capablility EXCEPT for the production number featuring Bill Robinson, Jenni, and Fats Waller which makes the whole watching experience worthwhile. Too bad it doesn't last longer."
4,Microsoft op system install,This product requires installing into a new notebook computer. The install went as planned and as expected. The delivery from Amazon was prompt. I especially liked being able to track it so that I could be home the day/hour it arrived.
1,Why pay for a bunch of 1s and 0s. It's not a real product!,"Imagine you could create in infinite number of copies of any given book. Say a dictionary. Now imagine that you wanted to sell the dictionary. Normal market economics would suggest that you have infinite supply which will far outstrip demand making the price as low as possible.Now enter software.The process of making software is a service. A service which should be paid for, but once the service is done what you have is infinitely reproducible. Giving it no real value.Now enter marketers.Marketers created the concept of ""Productizing"". See the pretty box? You don't need that. You're going to throw it away, but it helps you think you're buying something real instead of something that can be infinitely recreated.So why pay for it?You don't really have to. Operating systems exist that aren't productized and since this one is infinitely reproducible it will likely be copied.Get Linux! Ubuntu... it's free!"
2,Prepare for severe speed reduction and constant problems,"Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort."
2,Upgrade nightmare - Do a full image backup first !,"I tried to upgrade two computers successively. After many attempts and hours on the phone with microsoft, I had to restore backup images of the XP disk. Before you try, I recommend you download Acronis (the 15 day trial version is free) and backup up your system disk completly. Finally : don't trust the compatibility advisor."
4,There is a cost for saving money......,"I've been using Vista in the RC1 version since Fall '06. I liked it & got to know it, so I went for a retail version before the RC1 expired. This O/S isn't perfect, but nothing from Microsoft seems to be fully finished when it comes out; I did notice some useful changes/improvements done since the RC1 version. As with any new O/S, some patience & willingness to work thru problems is needed.One can save a lot of $$$ by going to the Upgrade version over the Full Package, but there's a catch (or 2)....it wants to be run out of an existing O/S.....if you need to adjust disk partitions or do a clean install, here's the drill:bootup with install disk, DON'T enter key code or choose to activateyou'll have access to the disk optionsafter install, run disk from within Windows, install AGAIN but you can enter the key code & request activationSimple, but time-consuming......"
2,INSTALL THIS AND VOID YOUR MACHINE'S WARRANTY,"Be careful before you install this ""anytime"" upgrade. I installed it on a new Dell that came with Vista Home Premium on it and first of all, besides wiping out all my data files which it said it wouldn't do (I did have backups but still), wiping out drivers such as for the computer's speakers that it came with, it turns out that Dell will not help with ANYTHING because they say that I have voided the one year warranty by upgrading the OS from one version of Vista to another. It's probably in the fine print somewhere but it still seems that a more visible warning should have appeared courtesy of Microsoft OR Dell."
1,BE CAREFUL!!,"Many of the security softwares DO NOT work with this product...like a previous poster said, you will have to delete your security softwares to even do the download of Vista. ZoneAlarm is not compatible in any way with this. Stick with Windows XP...at least the prices on that will be reasonable and we know it works....There is no need for this OS software, especially since it seems like it was rushed to get it on the market."
3,vista ultimate,"First Micro Soft Office Profrofessional is a 10 Star. It's to bad that Windows Vista isn't. Anyone developeing software especially a new operating system, should have taken the time to include drivers for all AUDIO AND PRINTERS ETC.It is faster on my machine but I only see some bells and whistles that have been used from other sources added into windows. Security is good but very anoying with those popup windows. I uninstalled it and went back to windows XP PRO...................:("
1,Makes DOS look good,"Many compatibility issues, drivers that aren't available, security so extreme it makes using many programs a chore to nearly impossible, and there did not seem anyway to disable this crap. Much slower response than XP. Wireless LAN products were much harder to setup than on XP. Put it on two computers, one was an upgrade and one was a clean install. The upgrade went fairly smoothly, but still several issues. The clean install took days to work out the compatibility issues and some were not solvable. Finally just put the old disk back in with XP on the computer which I did the clean install on. Maybe in 6 months or so I will try it again and see if Microsoft has the bugs worked out and the drivers are ready. This thing was just released too early"
2,Not Quite Ready or original,"People complain that Vista is a rip-off of Apple's OSX. Transpose Gadgets for Widgets, the search feature in the upper menu bar vs the lower menu bar, Aero vs. Aqua. Many will have to upgrade hardware to use this operating system. Here's a suggestion-if you go that route-buy a Mac. It comes with ""ultimate"" on all it's machines and can be had (in the form of a mac mini) for less than 600 dollars. With no known viruses,spyware,malware, and the ability to boot XP, the choice is a no brainer. XP is to OSX as Zune is to iPod."
3,Windows Vista Ultimate,"I originally loved Vista. I had no problems upgrading, which I have heard is a nightmare for most users... and everything ran quicker (and looks much better) than on XP... however, after 1-2 months of using Vista my computer is once again slowing and will often freeze for no reason. The firewall features are difficult to work with and the fact that not all driver updates are compatible with Vista is frustrating."
2,Send the Calvary,"I have spent at least 17 days talking with a level 2 tech working for M/S in India. I have turned a new machine into a piece of junk thanks Dell.I have bought a super high end from a sweat shop with tons of high end stuff like 512k video, new large size HD's. 2MB Ram. Cant do an upgrade with Just xp. M/S engineers lost all my data and everything else helping me now am going through the same issues just trying to activate. Fun adventure if you like working till all times of day and Night.Answer: Buy a machine with Vista already loaded, Doubt that you'll see one running ultimate( where all the good stuff resides)but remember is Microsoft were dealing with here. Buyer Bewhere"
1,Upgrade did not work for me.....,"The upgrade blue screened three times for me and although the clean install worked every time, I was unable to Activate the software. (Vista Upgrade demands you upgrade from an existing installation rather than doing a clean install). Hardware was a AMD 3800+, ATI x1600, 3GB RAM and a basic Asus motherboard -- i.e. nothing strange.A complete waste of time and I've ended up rolling back to Windows XP. I have returned Vista to Microsoft and will wait until they get it right before I try again.Microsoft technical support was polite, but so very very simple. They need to spend more than minimum wage on their help."
3,Write off Hardware support.,"HP and Windows have sunk to new lows. I have a newHP TouchSmart IQ770 19"" Desktop PC (AMD Turion 64 X2 Processor TL-52, 2 GB RAM, 320 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)system. I had a bad wireless keyboard. HP informed me that since I upgraded a new unit from Home Premium Vista to Ultimate, They no longer offered free support for my hardware problem. Even for my hardware!! Can you beleive it? The upgrade also knocked me out of my sound card drivers. I finally fixed the sound after deleting the driver and reloading. This is the worst experiance since I started with PCs in 1982."
1,Do not get Vista if you use Quickbooks,"I have had tremendous problems with Vista and a number of problems. I first tried to do the upgrade and about 2/3 of my programs failed. I then resorted to a clean install and although most of my programs work, I have had compatability issues with a number of programs such as Trend Micro. I had Quickbooks running for several days and then it failed and crashes every single time. I spent 5 hours one the phone with Microsoft and 2 hours with Intuit/Quickbooks and we tried every kind of complete install there is to no avail. Each company is now blaming the other and I am having to run Quickbooks on an old computer that is still XP. The advantegous of the program are meager compared to the headaches. Do your self a favor and wait a year or so until this is a stable program."
3,I can't Take THIS !,"Vista may look nice and i have to admit it , IT SIMPLY Looks amazing .. BUTtheres just so many Digital Right Management softwares ! I cannot run anything without having to actually go thru what seems likE A HUNDERED TERMS AND AGREEMENTS ! I've never been a fan of illegal music downloading , Most of my songs are from friends or from itunes and still .. And one thing i think most of you actually agree with is .. IT's SLOW! very slow Compared to my Windows XP , I Dont think theres such a thing as a better upgrade to do in my current computer . I invested more than 1000$ to upgrade and still .. The bottom line is Vista looks like heaven ! but it's just a little bit earlier to get it now .."
2,Cannot load -- and don't know why,"I've tried 3 times to upgrade from Media Center XP on a system that passes muster on the Upgrade Advisor site. However, every time I try to upgrade, the software loads, runs for over an hour, gets as far as ""starting windows for the first time"", and then tells me it could not configure one or more components. Never tells me what it couldn't configure. The only option at that point is to re-boot, at which time the old Windows is restored. I don't know if I'll ever get to use Vista on this machine."
3,Still got some kinks to iron out,"The Operating System has some potential, definately. Right now, however, it's VERY buggy still at this point. My advice is to wait until the first service pack is released before migrating from XP."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!....,"This is the worse OS that I have ever worked with. I am sick and tired of fighting with it everytime I just want to rename a file. (the pointer keeps changing into a ""clock"" and booting me out of the prompt). I ASSume that its the indexer, but am tired of dealing with it and the many other things this joke of an OS does to use up resources. (btw, I bought a very highend system that had vista home premium preloaded)Dont get vista!!"
1,Don't even think about it.,"Since micro soft support is an absolute joke, I'm left with only the option of telling the truth to the world. Hopefully you will tell everyone you know, as well. Micro soft (junk) vista is nasty. It is Very slow, it is very unstable, takes forever to boot up, takes for ever to load programs, and should be considered a Down-grade not an up-grade. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I had to install it 4 different times to get it to work. And my machine is pretty new with 4 gigs of ram, and dual Athlon CPUs. So don't waste your time or money. I'd give it zero stars if I could. And I am seriously considering taking microjunk to Small Claims Court."
3,Problematic,"got Vista Ultimate on a brand-new HP media PC, main purpose is to use as tv dvr and surfing.Ran into a few things that wouldnt work, like my USB scanner install failed, Nero7 not compatible, and cannot for the life of me get Youtube to work. It seems the flash install is somehow blocked by Vista's security.The change to windows file explorer is pretty radical and it is very hard now to find stuff on the drives. If you are used to using windows explorer as the main way to start apps by clicking on their names, you might be confused for a few days as to how to get to them.And now my Vista taskbar keeps flashing once a second onscreen in a very annoying way.Otherwise the TV DVR setup went fine and I enjoy the aesthetics. The photo viewer is a very nice addition."
3,Should have waitted a little longer,"Most 2006 Laptops are coming with a sticker claiming Vista compatible, however this is true lie, as when you begin the installation Vista runs a compatability check and you see by how many steps the Laptop sticker lied to you. Laptop manufacturers have lied once again."
3,More of this type and Kenny will be living under bridges,Not a very memorable CD at all. Just very average.
5,Old Enough,"I am old enough to remember sitting in the pool hall listening to Kenny on the juke box and sitting in the mustang and listening to him on 8-track. He has only gotten better through the years. He has a message that he wants to deliver to those who aged with him and those new comers just coming on the scene. Life is getting better, age has not limits. His voice and style of singing, brings each song/story to a vivid image in your mind. Just like Dolly, Kenny will continue to be a fixture in the country music world. This album brings a lot of emotions to the fore front. Things that have happen to get him to where he is now. This CD is well worth the investment. It is also an wonderful gift to give to a baby boomer."
5,Simply Amazing,"I have to say that this is truly an amazing album. He really has made an incredible album here folks. I bought it on a lark, just figuring I was worn out on the Twenty Greatest Hits album. I don't know if it's who he picked to produce it or what, but it's top of the line here. He sounds amazing, and if he keeps it up it will be one of the best ""comebacks"" in a long time. The songs are written with heart and soul and have a kind of hair raising feel to them as you listen. ""Someone is Me"" is just great. I hope it hits for him....and for everyone else as well. I wish I could put this review out for all to hear it, because it's worth the $10 or $12 bucks, trust me.Have a good one and enjoy, I did."
3,Very nice... until it broke,"For the first year and a half of owning this watch, I was very happy. The only annoying thing is that the watch is HUGE, and therefore rarely (if ever) fit under a long sleeve button down. But all that was worth it, because I loved the way it looked, and I got plenty of compliments on it.Then, a year and a half after owning it, the seconds hand fell off. This was just after regular use- no dropping or throwing across the room or anything, it just fell off. I saw it floating around on the watch face, in its own little world. Not only that, the automatic part of the watch stopped working as well- I guess if they figured that once the second hand is gone they can stop working. I kept wearing it because I was too lazy to get a new watch, and because it still kept time (the minutes and hours work on battery). But then the band broke, and I just said to hell with it, I'm getting a new watch."
4,Useful,"In this book interpretations are old but it is very useful to see what the basic idea is. I recommend to anybody who study on Beckett's masterpiece, waiting for godot."
4,Rockport Magical Wedge,Shoes are very comfortable. The color is slightly different than the picture. but overall I am very satified with this shoe
4,Rockport wedges,"Runs a little small, ordered a 7 but should have ordered a 7 1/2. very cute and comfortable. looks good with jeans."
4,Great looking shoe - wide not very wide,"This shoe looks great and I think would be comfortable... but... I ordered it in the wide (I'm wide, not double-wide), and it fits like a regular/narrow. I don't know if other shoes run that way, but i'm disapointed. The shoe itself though looks great."
2,Superficial Coverage,"This book is a good primer for those unfamiliar with the workings of China's economy and the reforms of the last decade that have fuelled China's growth. It is badly dated now (no fault of the authors) due to the Asian financial crisis. The biggest disappointment is that is deals very little with the book's supposed topic, the role of the overseas Chinese. The last half of the book doesn't even mention them! (well, barely...)"
2,Difficult to navigate.,"I bought this book to do a term paper containing the subject of sociobiology. I did not have time to read it page-to-page; and I was disappointed in 1) the abbreviated index (very slight); and 2) the the silly chapter names, like: ""A Bicycle is Not Enough; From Nature Up; The Rules of the Games..."" You get the picture--I could not find anything! This book is very difficult to navigate. Forget it.I do not recommend anyone purchase this; it is old and difficult."
4,not a toy..neat little bargain of a model. not much detail but good.,Wish the interior was not Tan. but this Car is detailed for the amount your paying. Pretty good bargain.
4,Works after an aluminum foil remedy,Mine stopped working a few days after we got it for X-mas. Itried the fix I saw here of putting aluminum foil between the positive leads (non springy sides) in the battery compartment and it works fine now. Also explains why wiggling the batteries may work in the short term as well.Thanks to the previous post.
5,YOU JUST GOTTA GET THIS PT FOR ANYONE 3+,"Both kids were hooked on this car from the store and stayed hooked when I got it home and out of the box. Saw some other reviews about battery problems...forget about it! It rocks, with cool music and real actions. No problems. GREAT TOY !"
3,Quality varies from marker to marker,"I've had this set for about a year. Most of the markers are still going strong, but two of them (brown and orange) dried out after very little use. I keep them all tightly capped and stored horizontally, as recommended on Expo's website:""How long is a marker supposed to last? As with any writing instrument, this depends upon users and frequency of use. When not in use, Expo markers stored horizontally with caps installed tightly will last approximately 2-3 years.""The brown and orange certainly didn't last that long for me, but then again I don't know when they were manufactured or how long they sat in Amazon storage waiting to be sold. When they stopped working I tried to resurrect them by storing them tip-down for a few days, as suggested by other websites and coworkers, but it didn't help.I wish the whole set had held up better, but the six that are still running seem to be of good quality and going strong."
1,cheap and nasty,"Once again the review must report that the item is not what is advertised - it is certainly not visibly coated and at night gives a nasty reflection in the display and resulting shot. It would be great if the supplier said - ""omigosh, am I really selling a piece of cr*p? Well everyone please send it back and I'll send you a really good one"", but that's not likley is it...oh well..."
4,Should have recorded the complete Villa-Lobos Suite,"Jorge Cardoso accompanies Smits on tracks 10, 16, 17 & 18, so this isn't an all-solo guitar recording. Also, note that Smits plays an 8-string guitar on this recording. I don't particularly like guitar duets or 8-string guitar work because I'm a solo guitarist and relate more to solo 6-string performances. But my major criticism, is that the Suite Popular Brasileiro was butchered and doesn't include the 1st and 4th movements, the Mazurka-Choro and Gavotta-Choro respectively. To make room for these movements, the Choros No. 1 should have been dropped which would have left ample space for the lesiurely pace at which she plays the Suite."
1,"dont read it, dont waste your time","READ THIS PARENTS AND CHILDREN!this book is definatly the slowest moving book i have ever read, and the plot is pretty boring. it moves so slow, that at times the author went into excrutiating detail of every little thing the characters did; like walking and holding an unimportant inanimate object. Trust me, you'll be sleeping before you hit page 100. I did! Yawntastic! I couldn't wait until i was over. please trust me and dont waste your time on this worthless trash of a book, but instead read an actual good book, like Redwall."
4,Spoiler Alert!,"This book includes the phrase, ""...that her father put in her stocking every Christmas"". It is a seventh grade level book (according to Accelerated Reader/Renaissance Learning), but if you have a younger child who wants to read this book, you might want to wait a few years."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"If you're between the ages of 9 and 12, then this book isn't so bad. But if you're a little older then you'll see all the holes in this story. A lot of the most important events are a little too convenient. Some things are too random or illogical. But if you don't really care about that, then it's okay. Worth reading if you're bored and have nothing else."
3,Hatching Plots,"I enjoyed reading this book, the first I've seen by Downer. I especially enjoyed her take on wizardly societies, and that she drew in myths and creatures from around the world. The gracious and competent Indian sorceress, Dr. Naga, was my favorite character.On the other hand, I felt Downer brought in so many characters and ideas that she wasn't able to explore any of them deeply. I also felt that some of the material was calculated to appeal to children -- a little too calculated -- and, again, not explored in enough detail to satisfy me. I may get more chances, though, as the possibility of a sequel was obvious in the closing chapters.The incidents where the little dragon become addicted to chocolate were amusing, but (yet again) I felt Downer missed many opportunities to highlight the foibles of the modern age as seen through the eyes of outsiders.Deby Fredericksauthor of ""The Magister's Mask."""
5,Uplifting!!!!,These dvds have been such an encouragement and vehicle for JOY in my family's lives!!!!!
5,A Joy,This was a joy to watch. The music and the scenes of the aid to the South African orphans was very touching. The program was put together very well .
1,Stinks,For my birthday my parents bought me this game. I read all the books and I loved them. So I get this game. As soon as I started it the controls were wacky. The graphics were okay but the gameplay stunk. The sound controls skipped beats so I quit. So I quit. Great waste of $50.00! Buyers beware.
3,I really wanted to like it,"I used this drill bit to drill 3 holes in granite. The bit clears the mill very fast and I like that, however the main carbide tipped cutting surface chipped, removing about slightly less than quarter of the of the main head. I really wanted the bit to perform, however I am going to go with the ""wild bore"" by bosch next time. I have used bosch bits before and the bit did not fail during the first day of use. I am really disappointed in the Dewalt product. As always maybe I got a bad one ....."
1,not Greg Brown the folk singer,"There is no way to tell that this is not Greg Brown of Iowa. There were no reviews, graphics or samples to help out on this similar name problem.So if you want the folk singer from Iowa this is not the album to get.One star just reflects that I'm not interested in this album which I bought bcause it was listed with all the other Greg Brown albums."
5,How do I buy this product,I want to purchase this product but I can't find the shopping cart on any other way to buy.
3,light gathering marginal,"Why did they go to a 25mm lens? Requires strong light, in spite of the coated lenses. 30 mm is min acceptable."
2,Maybe a backyard birder might like these...,"...but a true outdoor bird enthusiast??... I tried these binoculars last spring and found that even a blue heron nearly disappeared in ""gray fog"" when I tried to zoom in. Besides, it's next to impossible to follow a bird in flight, the field of view is just too narrow. In general I love Olympus products, their quality is excellent, but this compact marvel just tries to pack too much of a punch for its size."
1,Bad zoom binoculars,"When I decided to buy these they had a 3 star rating so I thought to myself, ""How bad could they be?"". My opinion? Worse than 3 stars.I couldn't focus onto an image clearly at 10x zoom and at 30x it just gets worse. And even at 10x zoom, the field of view is very small so tracking an object can be difficult. If the sun isn't out and the day isn't clear, the image through the binoculars at full zoom is dim at best.Olympus should have thought a little more before they released these. I'm going back to Canon optics."
1,How about the rest of the drill bit?,"I, too, purchased this item and found out it did not come with a shank. I had a used spline shank welded on to this new bit. The weld broke because the bit was hardedned steel and ""required special welding"". How about selling a drill bit with the shank attached?"
2,DID ANYONE THINK THE MUSIC TRACK WAS TOO LOUD?,"PLEASE HELP!!!! I just received THRILLER - FAN FAVORITES. The music track on the first episode ""THE GRIM REAPER"" I have watched is way too loud. It way over powers the voice track. Does anybody know if this is the way it is throughout the whole series. I do not want to buy this series where I will always have to be adjusting the volume up and down. I mean the music is WAY, WAY too loud. The picture is FANTASTIC and the music track when heard is very FULL and RICH sounding, but way too loud. Has anybody else experienced this problem or know if this problem has been corrected?"
3,Nice Book...,"The book wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it was worth keeping as a future reference. It involved more of the hard-core fantasy type stories and didn't give me enough info on ""adult"" fantasy like FIELD OF DREAMS."
5,The Challenge,"This book is excellent. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it. I don't want to reveal the plot to anyone --- please read this book. It was worth the wait."
3,Dark Challenge - am I bored yet?,"Don't take me wrong: I like Feehan's stories very much BUT: don't you think this author is repeating herself quite a bit? She writes and re-writes the same sentences all along her books... In this book, it is even worst then usual... Ok, He found light to his darkness... We got it! Say something else! You know everything there is to know about this story by reading the resume.... This book is a 377 pages but the story could hold into 50 pages..."
2,What the Heck Happaned??!,I was eagerly awaiting this title for months and was sorely disappointed when I finally did get it and read it! I can't believe how depressed I was after reading it!Not like the rest! Buy it and read it but definately not like the rest of the series!:(
5,wonderful - great read!,"I really enjoy Christine Feehan's world. Her writing is wonderful, entertaining, and her stories are just great.Definately worth reading...once you read one- you will be buying more!"
4,better book in the series,"an earlier book in the series, well worth the money, lots of tension and gruesome choices, good romance"
4,"Terrific installment, but not a standalone, disappointing.","OK I still loved it! BUT... where the heck was Gregori? Nothing would keep me from my siblings if I'd thought them massacred hundreds of years ago! I was sorely disappointed that none of the other characters showed up. Twin brother Aidan? And especially when Gregori and Savannah were in New Orleans - so close! Why not have ""The Dark One"" come to aid Julian and Darius, at least in some small way? Weird. It seemed really odd to me. And wouldn't the Prince & Raven have been interested enough to even send a letter or mind message or something?!Having said that, I did enjoy it, ripped through it in a day, and anxiously begin DARK FIRE next. But I'm starting now to skip through the so-called molten love scenes to get to the meat of the plot."
5,Another great Carpathian novel,"This is the 5th novel in a huge series of Carpathian novels and a very good one too. I loved Dark Prince, Dark Desire and Dark Magic. The 4th one, Dark Gold...not so much. Anyway, I just love the hot sexy romance between the very manly warrior, Julain and the very feminine singer, Desari. Just want to jump in this book and be a character! Can't wait to get through the rest of this series."
5,Coolest Book,"Christine Feehan wrote the best book I ever read. I believe that she will come far with her ideas. I like to become a writer and I hope that I can become as good as her. I hope she keeps writng about the Carpthains, do pardon me if I spell it wrong. I belisve that Christine Feehan should have more then 5 stars."
3,Dark Challenge,"I just finished reading all of the ""Dark Books"" and although Dark Challenge was not the best book in the series it is a helpful stepping stone. The story may have draged a bit, but we were introduced to new people. Of course that means that there will be other books. I sugguest that you read it just for the simple fact that you learn a little something new about their people, meet new ones and learn a bit about them. Plus while we wait for the next book it gives us all a chance to try to think about who should be next and who should go to whom. I personally hope to hear more about Gabriel and Lucian. Who knows maybe with Syndil's powers she wakes them up from the ground since she can feel the earth's pain and just maybe theirs. It would make for a good story, don't you think?"
3,A Challenge is what it was....,"I love Christine Feehan. I love the Dark series. This book, though, didnt agree with me. Dont get me wrong, the imagery in the book was great but the vibe just wasnt there for me. Julian was a strong character and so was Desari but a story about them meeting one moment then falling for each other the next without any action just didnt paint a picture worth reading about for me. I did read the whole book and I was disappointed that Feehan did not bring Gregori into play since Desari and Darius were his long lost siblings. *sigh* In the long run, I think if one read just this book alone it would be alot better but since it followed four other books that rocked my world...this one just came up...two stars short of a bunch."
5,Another great book!!!!,"Again, this book is a must read!!!! I highly recommend this book & all the other Dark Series books to anyone. I am finding Christine Feehan is becoming one of my favorite authors. She has out done herself with the Dark Series."
2,Get a new plot!,"Alright, I admit that I did love the dark series, I love Dark Prince and desire, but come on, get a new plot, already. It's the same thing over and over again, until you know what is going to happen pages before it actually dose.Guy meets girl, realizes she is his lifemate, guy goes after girl being overbearing jerk stomps all over girls wants, girl resists but gives in with hardly any effort.Come on, give us a woman who can stand up for herself. Someone that can't be manipulated into doing whatever the man wants. Strong women please, not a tough woman who stil gives in despite her whishes being ignored."
4,Another fabulously erotic read,"as with ms. feehan's other carpathian books, i found this to be an ejoyable, interesting & erotic read - this series is one of the most intriguing, sensual storylines i have ever had the pleasure of reading - i've read all 5 books and have never tired of the storyline, even though there are most definite similarties - how could there not be? while i agree w/the reviews that darius was a main character in this book, i didn't really feel that he overly intruded on dara & julian's story and was very intrigued by his character, particularly now that we know darius' story will be out this summer (i believe august release) - i gave this a deserved 4 star review, which is excellent - i believe 5 star ratings are reserved for, what in my opinion, is exceptional writing (mikhal, jacques & gregori's stories have all deserved 5 stars) - i am hoping that dark fires will earn a 5 star rating as well - really looking forward to it"
5,Great Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love all Christine Feehan's stories. I have all her books and intend acquiring them on audio form eventually. They are well done and follow the book closely. I enjoyed the interplay between Julian and Desari and the added bonus of the family members along with the interplay with outsiders. Loved hearing from Gregory re: his ""lost family"" being alive. Wish the author could write them faster because I'm anxious to hear more about other characters. Loved it!"
5,good,buy from author again because she is a really good author to buy from and if you start buying from her you will get hooked
5,Chris justs gets better & better,"This one is about the other golden twin Julian & Desari, one of the lost children. In this one it is different from the others in the series because desari is an ancient (about 800 years old) & can do far more than the other women who are lifemates. We finaly meet the brother & sister of Gregori (from Dark Magic), believed to have been slaughtered by the Turks in the 14th century.Julian is sent by Gregori to guard & protect Desari because she is believed to be a human wrongly targeted by a group of vampire slayers.When he sees her he realises he has found his lifemate & later also realises he has found the lost children.Once again Chris has writen another marvelous book in this series & I can't wait for more to be published."
4,Awesome Book,Love this book. Only thing I wish they would do is publish the number of the series. I keep having to go back to the first book to figure out which book I need to read next.
5,Dark challenge,Awesome read!! Cant wait for the next book!!! The story is enticing and grabs the reader for a great adventure.
2,Typos and Editing Errors Mar Excellent Book,"This 5th book of the Cartpathians series would have been a transporting love story if I could have overlooked the, literally, hundreds and hundreds of typos and editing errors. It is as if someone typed this book from manuscript and never re-read it for corrections. Hundreds of misspelled words, words changed (perhaps due to spell check?), missing words, the vast scope of the errors means that the reader is constantly interrupted from the story to try to figure out what the correct would [wood, word?] should be. (Pardon my joke at the editor's expense.) There should have been a discount to readers for acting as their own editor. I desperately wanted an editor's red pen to circle errors on almost every page.The story is lovely, if you can find it amongst the errors."
4,quick and easy,"I purchased this product at a local hardware store. I've had a slow running drain for 2 or more years, I've used what seems like every product ever made. Each product has had little to no effect. I was hesitant in thinking this product would do any good. I followed the directions exactly pouring the recommended 2 cups of product down my stubborn drain. I waited longer than the 10 minutes stated perhaps about and hour. I then ran water for several minutes, the sink was draining much better but the drain clearly still had some block. I poured another cup full down the drain before calling it a night. The next morning I turned the sink on full blast, alas draining correctly. Just to be sure I stoppered the sink, filled it part way then unstoppered while the water was still running. To my amazement clear drain! I only gave 4 stars because I had to repeat the process, if it had worked the first try I would have given a full 5 stars."
4,"John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, A Private Life","After visiting Quincy, MA, I realized I knew almost nothing about JQA, so I ordered this book. Good choice.Precocious, brilliant, irascible, hyper-critical of himself, always striving for the family tradition of integrity, esteem, and honor, and only in his final years receiving accolades for his accomplishments, JQA presents a fascinating study of an intellectual on Jefferson's plane. Because of his diaries and letter-writing, we have a view into his innermost thoughts. Ahead of his time, he was probably the first influential politician to declare against slavery."
4,Long on introspection...short on context,"Nagel's biography was written specifically with the knowledge that there already existed a length 2 volume treatment on Adams by Samual Flagg Bemis. Bemis's work, in Nagel's mind, was as good a treatment on the substantive work and the historical background of his times as we were to get. Therefore, he focuses on Adams' personality. I wished that he would have talked more about the issues of the day and gone into the political background for Adams' decisions more. Other than that, it is a very solid biography of an American statesman who will be more remembered as a great diplomat and Congressman passionately opposed to slavery than as a President."
5,"Entertaining, informative, reveals innermost person of JQA","I have read 100s of books on American History and biographies and feel that this book weaves extremely well the family life and political and the trials and tribulations of both. I could not put it down. The negative comments in Amazon I feel are unfounded in that this is only a 400 page book and could not possibly cover such a complex and accomplished man with everything about him. If you want it all about anyone, then you usually have to read many books. If I was only going to read one book on JQA though, this could be the one that maximizes both aspects of his life for a reader. Superb book."
4,John Quincy Adams,"This is the second biography of JQA which I have read. Both made it apparent that JQA was a brilliant diplomat and an inept politician. Of the six men who were secretary of state prior to their election as president, none--including the revered Jefferson--were great presidents. The author's treatment of JQA's bipolar personality, his relationship with his parents, and how this affected his career path and family life was excellent.The only flaw that I could find in this book (and I regret that Paul Nagel died earlier this year as I would have written to him about this) is on page 225.""Along with 250 other pupils, including sons of the duke of Kent, John and Charles Adams boarded at Dr. William Nicholas' academy nearby.""The duke of Kent (future father of Queen Victoria) had no sons--legitimate or illegitimate. Perhaps Nagel meant to say the duke of Clarence, Kent's older brother, who had several illegitimate sons."
4,"Excellent Review of JQA, via his personal journals","The figure of JQA was one of the most striking and prolific of the 19th century. Prof. Nagel has made judicious decisions in developing the character of Adams from his diaries. However, this gives the biography a decidedly introspective feel. The emphasis on the Adams family (while highly important) adds to this feeling of introspection. However, given the volume of information regarding JQA this is an excellent overview of the life of a truly unique man."
4,Insightful Bio,"I enjoyed reading this book for many reasons. I like how the author Nagel, emphasizes JQ's travels, his parents, his relationship with his beloved Harvard, his self loathing, life experiences, and other parts of the man's personality that really shaped his psyche throughout his life. It was wonderfully written although I do wish that the author covered more of his presidency. In the novel Nagel does say why he didn't elaborate more on the tumultuous four years of JQ's administration but still I completed the book desiring more from that part of his life. For that reason it does not get 5 stars. Nagel is a very good researcher and compares well to other famous presidential biographers such as McCullough. I'm reading a biography on every president and this effort goes in the top third of my readings. I hope whomever picks up this book enjoys it as much as I have."
4,A very good read,"John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, a Private Life is a very good read. Its easy to understand. The author manages to keep my interest by his writing style. You don't have to have a masters degree to read this book.After reading this book, one will have a better informed idea of JQA's life. Overall I felt that the book was a little brief and should have dug a little deeper, but there is only so much you can say in 427 pages. Another 300 pages would have allowed the auther to dig a little deeper in the life and presidency of John Quincy Adams. That being said, I highly recommend this book."
5,"Outstanding, Outstanding, Outstanding",My desire to read is never ending and this book was one that I could not put down. There are books and there are books that are truly worthwhile. This book was so good that I recommended to my son that he take the time to read it himself. Truly an outstanding work.
3,"As a lightweight introduction, it is ok!","As the title of the review suggests, I have used this text has an introductory / revision entry point for some of my English students who were struggling to access the plays. The style and content of the DVD is generally energetic in a low budget sense. More importantly, the DVD managed to provoke a few laughs to engage the audience as they watched and motivated them to think more deeply about the play/s.Whilst this DVD is not the answer to anything, it could be another useful complimentry educational aid if used in the appropriate way in association with other resources.Othello"
5,Super cute border,Brand new. In package. I received this idea really quick. Very satisfied and can't wait to use this in my class room.
3,So easy,"I was desperate for a copy of this book because I met the author some years ago. I was surpised how easy it was to get it, although it has been out of print."
5,One of my favorites,"The audio quality is not the best, but there is a vivacity to these recordings that I find terribly engaging. This is one of my favorite albums in my classical collection."
2,Maybe for a manual tranny.,Do not buy it if you have an automatic. It will ruin your tranny eventually. Buy a chip from Tony Wildman at Total Diesel Performance. It may cost a little more but you won't be sorry.
4,Great Music,"This CD is great. The combination of Live and Studio music makes for a very compelling mixture. Its major flaw would have to be some of the songs are not as well recorded on the live CD. Some of the songs I would like to hear the studio version of are only in the Live disc. This is allright, but dissapointing at the same time. The music itself cannot be beaten. It is simply inredible."
4,A great live album.,"The second CD in this collection is a wonderful live album. The performance is amazing, and the audience participation does not get too annoying.I did not care for the first disk very much, but many other people love it. The studio outtakes are raw, without the orchestration that I have come to love. They are also missing the wonderful drumwork that has thrilled me since Jars' first album.I still say that this album is worth buying, whether you are a big Jars fan, or not."
5,THIS ROCKS!,"Okay guys, the new JOC album is awesome! It's so cool to hear the crowd singing to the band's top songs ever! Go out and buy the new CD today!"
3,Disappointing To Me,"I adore Jars of Clay, but this CD didn't do (almost) anything for me.Most of the re-do's of old songs on the ""From The Studio"" disc sound watered down and quite bland (in comparison with the originals), but I must admit the new songs are great (The Valley Song [Sing Of Your Mercy], Dig, Redemption). I do, however, like tracks 1-2, and 10.I never have liked live albums, I don't know why. When I'm there at the concert it's okay, but I just don't like them otherwise. I heard that JOC's music transferred well to the stage so I bought the album. I wasn't impressed, but at the same time not disgusted. My favorite live version was ""I'm Alright.""I wouldn't really suggest this album, but that's just based on me and my tastes, so try it for yourself I guess?"
4,Nice studio/stage review of prior material,"I was very pleased when I listened to both CDs. The acoustic disc gave their old songs a new face. I listened to it about three times before I was satisfied that I had picked up on the variations - very nicely done. The concert disc, as all concert discs usually are, was great! It's always nice to hear the roar of the crowd, the crowd singing and crowd chanting - especially if you've been to a concert, this is an instant walk down memory lane.Bravo guys! Keep the good music comin'!"
2,"OK, but not my type of songs","This CD is OK. I heard the song ""40 DAYS"" by Jars of Clay, and I knew that I had to have one of their CDs. I found it at my local music store, it was regurally 18 dollars but on sale for 13 and then I had a 5 dollar off coupon, so I got it for 8 bucks. I like the songs, but I dont like the slowness of the songs. I DO like ""like a child"" and there is one other one that I do like. When my brother gets home from work, I am going to try to sell it to him. Cause I dont like it. But you may...."
2,Ok to listen to but not a very good french tutorial.,"Some of the songs are useful, but most do not translate literally which could be a problem if you are trying to learn French. (for example in France apparently you come from Alabama with banjo under your arm). Another song is completely different wording, just sung to the same tune as Twinkle twinkle little star. The book that comes with the tape does tell you that is is different but has no literal translation.My thought was to play the tape during long car trips with my kids (6 and 3). They don't complain but most of the songs are hard to understand, Especially the songs sung by children. They most certainly haven't learned much French as a result of listening to the tape. A couple of the songs are fun/catchy, one in particular is stuck in my head and I wish it would go away, but all in all I was disappointed."
4,A really warm series of short readings...,"I don't know what point Barry is trying to make with these collection of stories, but I couldn't find one.What I did find was an overall warmth and a feeling of happy contentedness as I read through.The works aren't deep, individually, but as a collection they speak wonderfully for Americana.It's a good book for family reading time... in front of a fireplace on a cold winter day, on the porch during the summer, or anytime you want to feel good without working too hard at it."
2,Enuff Already!!! End the Agony & GET ON With It!,"This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches ""Z""!"
3,Where Is The Original?,"I was so excited to see this on CD. When I received my order I put in the CD expecting to hear the original classic album with bonus tracks. I got, like the first reviewer pointed out, a collection of outtakes. Fine because Anthony More is an awesome artist, most have never heard of, but the songs paled in comparison to the ones on the original album. This released with the original would have been incredible, but maybe asking too much. I would therefore gladly take the original. Please someone tell me what happened and please release the original. That was an undiscovered masterpiece that deserves a release. Please"
5,Underrated But Great!,"Anthony More a.k.a Flag Face is one of those artists who really should have became better known. His music is part progressive and part new wave. At times he's slightly reminiscent of the Police and David Bowie. ""World Service"" is More's best album. With tribal sounds in the title track to overlaying vocals in the rocking ""Run Right Back"". A. More's music is well produced and the guitar is a main force and is performed with skill and adventure. If you're looking for a new favorite from the eighties KROQ era- Anthony More (now Moore) is the one to check out. Also worthy is his preceding album ""Flying Doesn't Help""."
4,1st Valentine Gift,Bought this bear as a first valentine day gift for 5 month old granddaughter. I did not see the bear but her parents thought it was a thoughtful gift. They felt the bear is well made and will be a soft and cuddly toy for her.
2,Potential but too many problems.,"Boyfriend of a dead girl takes revenge on the son of a god fearing, but paradoxically satanic-like, torture and killing family. A classic twisty kidnap thriller except the over scripting just made the story confusing resulting in little tension and drama. The acting is too over-the-top directed (stand here, move there like this) making the movie not very believable. The viewer feels as if they're standing along side the director hearing his directions. The dialogue is typical Hollywood make believe talk adding to that too staged feeling i.e. as if every short sentence is rehearsed and ""retaken"" multiple times. The usual dumb decisions that only characters in movies make. The usual ""you think people are dead but they seem to come back with one last surprise knife attack"". A too predictable and emotionally ho hum movie."
2,Don't waste your time,"Only being able to save your game a half-dozen times or so over the course of the entire game is bad enough.But this game is ridiculously hard. The combat engine is horrible, the weapons are ridiculously weak, and ammo pickups are rare, which is unusual since it takes around 50 bullets to kill anything. And when you do run out, unlike in previous aitd titles, you have no defense whatsoever. In fact, it seems like the only way to get anywhere is to constantly run.I got it for 10 bucks and consider it a waste. After having to wade through the same cut-sceens over and over again, i just got bored with it.I give it two stars simply because it had some potential. Unlike the resident evil series, this was genuinely scary. The atmosphere is nice and creepy, the use of a flashlight being a nice touch. That and the various monsters pop up out of nowhere, usually when you least expect them."
5,Not very recent but still a must have,"I had bought this game at Mardens about 6-7 years ago and during the years had ended up misplacing on of the CD's. Unfortunatly you need all 3 CD's to beat the game, so I was in tough situation. Happened to be crusing through Amazon when I had the idea to see if they had it, and sure enough they did. The quality was perfect, even though it was used. Definitely a 5 star :-D"
1,Don't waste yor time,A great looking game. Moody. Atmospheric. Creepy. Unfortunately the PC version is so riddled with bugs and lockups that it's almost unplayable ...Save your money or at least wait until the manufacturer comes out with a patch.
2,How to destroy a franchise,"The original Alone in the Dark game was truly innovative and set many technological landmarks for other PC games of the day. Oh how far we have strayed. This game uses the Nocturne engine and, like every previous game that has used the Nocturne engine, the end result is washed out graphics, horribly awkward camera angles, bad movement control, and the joy of having to fight offscreen creatures that you can't see unless you run to a different area. I can only imagine that the Nocturne engine is [inexpensive] to license."
3,Drip Irrigation Manifold,"A good way to distribute flow to individual plants. Much better than punching holes in drip tubing. My only complaint is the flow screws (plastic of coarse)are easy to strip and hard to fit a screwdriver to. To prevent that, I turn them all on full and use adjustable spray/drip heads at the plant end instead."
2,it clogs up too easy,I've used it and its better than most I've used but for some reason their is no pressure coming out of it. I gave up on it and go with soil now. I gave up on the aeroponics systems. Theirs just too much maintenance involved so I don't use these products anymore. Soil is the way to go. Trust me
1,Still No Mac Support,"Usually when a company drops Mac support sofware goes straight to hell. Have no reason to think that this would be a different story. WP used to be solid competitor to MS Orfice now lingers on the fringe. Oh, well..."
2,not really a theremin concerto,"it's not really clear what this album what this album is supposed to be. I bought it because it claimed to be a theremin concerto. I found that it only had one theremin track on it and that it's mostly just standard orchestral fare. I think whoever put it together wanted to give an overview of concert music from that period in the early 20th century, at least that's what I gathered from the unfocused liner notes. it is interesting to hear the looseness of orchestras in those days but it is stunted, most pieces only a selected movement or two, a mix tape made by a not-so-lucid friend. If you're looking for a theremin concerto stay away!!"
4,chocolate fountain,I was terrified that this chocolate fountain would not work or wouldn't work well as I had sold a chocolate fountain buffet for 200 people and this was the centerpiece. I plugged it in half an hour early and microwaved some sephra chocolate and it worked like a charm for over 3 hours and almost 20 lbs of chocolate and almost 200 people. So far so good.
3,Adequate for a Short Trip,"This guide only really covers the major, better-known attractions of each region in Indonesia.The Lonely Planet or Rough Guide are much better for a more in-depth coverage of the entire country, or go for the Periplus ones for more detail on particular regions."
1,Calvin's intent was a 200% rejection of purgatory & mystiscm,Calvin's orignal book was about spiritual deperation and the immortal soul in view of God impending eternal conscious torment. Calvin was specifically rejecting a mystical soul assent or journy to heaven without the fear of God's eternal conscious torment. But purgatory is the same false security of soul sleep. Father Tavard couldn't have done a worse diservice to God and Calvin and his is readers and himself.
5,Easy and complete grammar book,"I have used other Hungarian grammar books (smaller, easier to carry) and I got this one based on the author's ""Colloquial Hungarian"" textbook. This grammar is clear and comprehensive and satisfying. Such books are not 'read' but investigated, and so far I am delighted."
5,Hungarian: An Essential Grammar (Routledge Grammars),"Excellent! Perfect for the Hungarian speaker who wants to learn, or refresh their language skills, especially while using the Hungarian TV shows online. This book is great for easy quick reference."
5,Great gift!,Gave this to my 16-year-old grandson who is in to a lot of different sports and he says it is awesome. Gave him a different view of approaching his games and what he can learn from them.
5,Great staple,"I think that this is a great, healthy low cal staple to keep around. You can use it on meats or veggies. I personally wasn't into it as a salad dressing, but that is just me. Others may feel differently. I want to try the Bragg's dry Seasoning next for the salad."
3,No Belt Clip - GIP,"It says it has a belt clip when in fact it only has a belt loop strap attachment, if it fits on your belt."
4,Universal Case,"This is a great case for all smaller GPS units. It fits PN40/60 series, Oregon, Dakota, Explorist, etc size GPS units. I use it protect my GPS from scratches when it is in my pack or travel bag. Good value for the price."
3,consider the purpose before purchase,"I was looking for something a bit more than just a quickly made costume cape and chose this one because of it's comparatively moderate price. Yes, it is a bit more than a cheap quicky, and yes it also falls short of one of the high end, high priced capes. I guess it's exactly what I paid for. It has a nice look when worn. I did decide to do some edge stitching since the satin lining tended to hang forward of the black material by about an inch. The black material is somewhat stiff so the hood does not drape gracefully. We used this cape in a photo shoot for grim reaper images and the pictures came out very good."
2,OK for Halloween,I expected a little better quality material. This cape is ok for Halloween. I wanted it for more than costume wear & it's really is only suited for that.
3,Doesn't take advantage of Blu-Ray,"So less then a year after Strictly Strange, which only featured a few songs in concert, we get Live In Kansas, which is a full 90 minutes of concert footage. Honestly I feel kind of ripped off by this double dip but that's ok. While the concert is great, don't bother spending the extra money on the Blu-Ray. The only audio option is DOLBY PRO LOGIC. Yes, Pro Logic on a Blu-Ray concert film. Where is the 5.1 surround? They don't even bother to warn you that on the back of the box.Still, this is a must have for any Tech N9ne fan, even if you've seen him in concert before. There is a good mix of classic and newer songs."
4,Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston...the Fleming Fag,"If you want to find out what kind of a brainwashing, low down, good for nothing person Reginald Johnston is like, then you need to read this book. This old cockraoch constantly used the kid emperor for his own needs. Johnston taught the young emperor about homosexuality as Johnston was a homosexual. Johnston should go down in history for a child molester and thief of children."
2,Does not rake our leaves well,I see larger machines of this nature in the hay fields so thought it would work well on my leaves. It did not. We have a number of Southern oaks in our yard and many leaves in the spring. This rake did a poor job of raking them into windrows. It takes many passes with the rake and even then doesn't get them all. It might work well on a different type of leaf but for the live oaks and similar varieties it just down't work.
3,cute but not my ideal recieving blankies,These blankets were very cute. I gave them 3 stars because I didn't think they were that soft for flannel material recieving blankets. I have some winney the pooh bear ones bought from Target and they were MUCH softer than these. The transportation pattern was very cute though.
1,What a Waste!,"Gosh, I kept waiting for this book to get good, but it never did. The story line was completely FLAT! No excitement. And speaking of the story, maybe it was just me, but a lot of it didn't make a whole lot of sense. It just didn't flow right to me. Character were poorly developed. BUT, it did have some funny parts, however they weren't worth enough to read the whole book.And his secret. PLEEEASE! Give me a break. I guessed the ""secret"" very early on, of course, and was hoping I was wrong. It seemed rather unlikely and completely out of left field. Nothing about the scope of the character made the secret believable. Anyway, the end was the most disappointing of all. Just a COMPLETE WASTE. Don't even bother."
2,Coulda Been Better,"He had some great insight, but too often he seemed to ignore obvious problems with his arguments and didn't back up some claims. If you're going to make these claims, fine, but please, they need to be backed up. This is about the Bible, so I don't expect to find many unbiased opinions, one way or the other, but Gabel did too many things that are unacceptable for an academic work of any kind."
1,Make sure you know what you're reading,"If you're looking for a Bible-bashing book, you came to the right place. The authors have an incredibly strong anti-religion bias. There's some cool info in there, but you're going to have to wade through rhetoric on the topic that the authors swear that the book leaves alone (religious purpose). But again, you'll probably like it if you are an atheist."
5,Tons of Fun Shaggy Kabob,This is a substantive & colorful toy that will give your bird hours and hours of fun! This is a pretty heavy toy that will stand up to even the largest of birds. My conure has a huge personality so big toys like this are perfect for him.
3,A catalog of designs that leaves you wanting.,"From THE design firm, IDEO, this book has cataloged a range of product and environmental designs that are at the forefront of our culture. With innovation after innovation from IDEO I would have thought this book would be more . . . well . . . innovative. In their defense, this is the best way to have their design portfolio on your home coffee table, at least for now. Incredible pictures and some good documentation, but The Art of Innovation, by Tom Kelley, is the roller coaster story behind it all, this book is meerly a slide show from the trip."
3,A little self promoting,Having worked with IDEO when I was @ Kodak I was a little disappointed. The process working with them was better than reading the book. It was a little bit more self promoting than I like in a business book
2,Inefficient IDEO-logy,"IDEO's method for solving inventive problems derives from Alex Osborn's development of ""Brainstorming"" in the 1940's, and like Brainstorming it gives the illusion of productivity while in fact wasting cognitive resources. Genrich Altshuller, the creator of the Theory of Creative Problem Solving (which also goes by the Russian acronyn TRIZ), criticizes Brainstorming in his book ""The Innovation Algorithm"" by pointing out that it lacks an efficient search strategy and depends on attacking a problem with a mob in the hopes that with enough people it can stumble onto a solution through chance. By contrast, with a rational inventive problem solving algorithm, which Altshuller helped to develop, one person could find a solution in a day and free up the other 49 people to engage in other valuable activities. Inventors in the West have yet to study and absorb the implications of Altshuller's revolutionary findings."
1,Horrible,This thing is a piece of crap. You could get a finer sprey mist of you swigged the paint around in your mouth and spit it at whatever you are painting.
5,A must have for All My Children viewers,This is an excellent book for anyone who loves All My Children. I bought mine used and it was in excellent condition. As a long time All My Children viewer (from the beginning) this was a trip down memory lane for me. It covered all the years from 1970 to 1995. The color pictures were beautiful and the trivia section in the back was wonderful. This is a must have book for all serious and long time viewers of All My Children.
5,Miss this show,Watched for 40 years. This brings back a lot of memories. It is fun to read the stories and remember.
4,Decent EP Worth owning just for MacPherson's version of Bankrobber,"Greg MacPherson is a talented folk singer/songwriter. This EP is worth owning for his version of The Clash song, Bankrobber. It is by far the best version of the song I've ever heard. As for the rest of the album, I can take it for what it is and I enjoy his fantastic voice. Check out his full length LP."
2,the hype is better than the video,This is not what I expected in content. I found better information for free on yutube. This was quite amatearish!
2,Doggie Cuts,This DVD was not what I thought it would be. Was hoping to learn how to do a proper shave on my poodles but it only showed how to do a trim on long haired dogs.
2,Not as easy as it looks,"Hello, I don't have much to say, but I think it would be nice if we could get a Shih Tzu in the picture or something.Anyway, my pesos could have been better spent on buying a decent doggie clipper which by the way cost well over $1XX.xx.If you have never cut dog hair (not fur) then you will probably not see much benefit from this DVD."
1,lousy,This dvd makes you believe that a whole new world of dog grooming will be at your feet. It actually does not contain more info then the cd that came FREE with my pet clipper. What a rip off!
4,Great At Home Pet Grooming Video,"This video is just what one needs to feel confident in grooming your dog at home....But again.it shows all dogs very use to and liking to be groomed.....I found it limiting only in what one does if your dog is new to grooming or does not like to be groomed...there is not showing use of a grooming table or more professional equipment like the nail dermal instead of cutting nails...But overall if you get this video,and your dog is use to being groomed youl find it just what you need in terms of good instructions in how to get the cut, how to use the clippers,and guards to get the proper length for a professional looking groom for your dog.."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,I was rather disappointed w/this DVD.If you are a first time dog owner--the bathing and health tips would be helpful. I found parts of the grooming to be helpful and some things not as inclusive as I had hoped for. Also for someone who has never used clippers before I think it would have been helpful to go thru some clipper basics.My main complaint is the format of the DVD. There is no way to go back and review selected material--you just have to fast forward from the beginning and try to get to where you want to go. It was such an aggravation.I think I'd keep looking for a better DVD if I had it to do over.
3,So So...,I must say after watching other grooming DVD's that this one rates some where in the middle. I was hoping to learn a lot more on how to groom Yorkies but I found other DVD's were better.
2,Not for the beginner,"I was hoping for a beginning lesson on grooming my dog - just the basics. This is more styling and tips, for those who are already using grooming tools and know what to do. This would be useful for someone wanting to improve their grooming skills, but not very useful for a beginner."
5,Excellent!!,"Loved this dvd! It arrived in timely fashion, is very helpful. I have watched it numerous times already and used the advice to groom my dogs. Would highly recommend to anyone!"
3,shipping,they waited forever to ship it and failed to disclose that you could only get 6 characters on the cup - terrible customer service
1,Not what I expected,"I had an Emerson shower radio and loved it. I bought this one for my brother as a Christmas present. I though by paying more it would be a good product. It was not, the chrome rusted on it, and it never had good reception. The volume also was not reliable on it, it would be very quiet and then be very loud without adjusting the volume. The only useful part about it was the clip to hang it."
1,Bad sound - hard to use.,"I had a CD/radio for the shower that crunched through batteries way too quickly, and considering I just listened to the radio for an hour a day, I figured I'd get a simple, inexpensive shower radio with low battery consumption.This did fit the inexpensive part, and the battery requirement, but wow, does it sound terrible. I listen to talk radio in the morning, which is probably requires the least phonic quality of any radio genre. The little speaker puts out tinny, trebley sound that is only worsened when bouncing off of the tile walls of the bathroom.Controls are dial-based too, which is fine for volume but makes tuning stations a laborious task. It doesnt help that the scale is so small on the tuning knob.I guess the only positive I would give it is the design, it looks good and the hook at the top is convenient."
3,Too loud/Too soft,I love the size of this radio but the problem is that you cannot adjust the volume easily..its either too loud or too soft..then when you shut it off you have to start all over again because the on-off dial is the volume dial..
1,Shower radio,"I think it is terrible. The sounds is tinny and ear piercing. I do not like it all. If I hadn't thrown away the box, I would have returned it. The reception is not great either!"
1,so bad i looked for it so i could write this,"I would never purchase this radio or anything else made by this manufacturer. I'm looking for a decent shower radio for my wife for Christmas because of how bad this one is, and I made a point to look for this one so I could review it. Half of the time it doesn't work at all. When it does you have to turn it on and off several times in a row before it actually turns on. The date and time seem to change at random which is fine because it's too small to see if you're not right next to it anyway. The reception is okay but you better hope you have one radio station you REALLY like because it's nearly impossible to tune in. As for sound quality, I don't expect much from a molded plastic radio intended for the bathroom, but even still the sound is remarkably bad. If you're like me and you base purchases on user reviews, don't buy this."
2,Didn't last long.....,"This product is great in theory....the functions were all useful. However, it stopped working after about two weeks! I think the problem was that my partner took the batteries out to use for something else. And when he put new ones in a day later, it just didn't work at all! I tried several different kinds of batteries (rechargable, non-rechargable, etc.) and nothing made it work. I ended up sending it back, and have since purchased a higher-quality product."
3,take it for what it is,"I don't for one minute believe that this LP was meant to be neither serious nor a challenge to some of the great disco performers of that era. I view it more as a novelty item like the recording done by William Shatner. I enjoyed it just knowing that old Ethel could still belt out a tune at her age. I hope she had fun making it because I had fun listening to it. If you don't like Ethel Mermen then don't bother buying this CD but if you're a fan then take it for what it is, an old woman at the end of her career just trying to kick up her heels. You go Ethel!"
1,A complete atrocity,"This album contains disco versions of classics like ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" (a Cole Porter tune), ""I Got Rhythm"" (from the musical ""Crazy for You""), and ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" (penned by Irving Berlin), all arranged by Peter Matz. The album was produced in the summer of 1979 at the height of the commercial overkill of disco, when rock and soul stars as well as untalented singers were rushing to record sub-standard disco songs. Merman sang these songs all in one take on one day. The arrangements were not well thought out, with plenty of disco cliches and the instruments sounding out of place and lifeless. The way the background singing was handled, with lyrics like ""Why why why, baby"", is laughable. The album is horrible and unenjoyable. If you want to hear disco done right, check out artists like Chic, Jamiroquai, Voyage, Shalamar, France Joli, and Players Association."
1,Ethel boogies.,"Ethel Merman was one of the greatest Broadway performers of all time. Someone had the bright idea of having Ethel record a disco album. All the songs chosen for the project were songs she had previously sung on Broadway. Ethel reportedly refused to sing along with disco tracks; instead she sang the songs the same way she always had, cutting 14 of her ""classics"" in one take each (so they say). Afterwards, disco backing tracks were added to her voice. The results are very campy and ridiculous. It's bad, but in an entertaining way. There is one bonus song added to the seven songs that were on the original album. Not sure why they only added one song when Ethel recorded seven more songs. Perhaps they never recorded the backing tracks for the rest of the songs."
5,This album rocks.,Ethel Merman Disco AlbumIf any album can be credited for effectively killing disco this would be it. Not that I support that but this album is HILARIOUS! You go Ethel!
4,Let's Call It Unique,"After listening to The Ethel Merman Disco Album, here's what I think happened: Some crafty record producer slipped acid into Ethel's Cracklin Oat Bran, then whisked her off to the studio to lay down these tracks while she was still tripping. ""It's a full house! Everybody's here! Now get out there and give it all ya got, Ethel. It's Showtime!""I'll rate this album at four stars out of respect for Ethel Merman's talent and for the wackiness of her agreeing to this project in the first place. Her voice is in excellent shape; it just doesn't mix with dubbed-in disco. The sound is formulaic, with drum machines, disembodied backup singers, and all the trappings of the cheesiest of the disco sound. ""I Got Rhythm"" begins with only piano accompaniment and is lovely, but sure enough, the drum machine kicks in again and we're back on Fellini's dance floor.Listen for yourself!"
5,cake from scratch yummmmmm,This book is a keeper. For those of us who know the difference . Highly recommend along with a visit to her bakery if you are In Connecticut.
4,Core those holes,"I need to drill five inch round holes in solid cement. For a dry drill, this works quite well. It should be stated somewhere that this bit does require both the shank and centering bit, also, so there's an extra $75 or so. Also, this bit cannot do well in aggregate. Smooth cement and concrete it does quite nicely in, though. When you get to the maximum depth (about 3 inches) then pull the bit out and chisel out the initial cut, then you can finish drilling. I've gotten 20 holes out of it without resharpening yet."
1,Reviews are for another title,"The reviews shown for this DVD,""The Assassination of JFK"" are for the DVD,""The JFK Assassination:The Garrison Tapes."" Amazon has the same reviews for BOTH videos. I bought a used VHS video,(The Assassination of JFK) because of the very good reviews shown here about this being a Jim Garrison tape. This is NOT the Jim Garrison video mentioned in these reviews. Trust me, I paid $15 to find out. This tape,""The Assassination of JFK"" is not a bad tape, but it was not worth $15 used.If your wanting the Jim Garrison Tapes, Be sure you get the one titled ""The JFK Assassination: The Jim Garrison Tapes."""
4,"[Four of Four stars on my rating scale] A very soild tape with experts like Fletch Prouty, Jim Garrison prove the Warren fiction","The Warren Report, to put in niceterms, is full of prunes! Thisvideo came out only six monthsbefore Mr. Garrison died. Butmost was filmed between 1988-91.Mark Lane (Moshe Levine) is hereas well and he wrote two veryfine books, one of which was theORIGINAL basis of Stone's finefilm, 'JFK'. The other, Plausi-ble Denial is based on why hethinks Stone's people went theother way on some things plusthe Liberty Lobby case v. E.Howard Hunt in Jan. 1985, whichproved the Watergate liar HuntWAS in Dallas, Texas that day!Garrison is very good in hereand if you want to know the truth,Mr and Mrs America, get this tapewhile you can!"
1,Tape is mis-identified,"The one star rating is not because of the tape, but because it is not what the description says it is. It is NOT the Jim Garrison film produced by John Barbour. Instead, it is by Denis Mueller, edited by Greg Newman, and written by Warren Leming and Carl Davidson. Its run time is 78 minutes. Hopefully this review will prevent someone else from being disappointed by what they receive."
5,CONSPIRACY PROVEN...NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,"This movie will blow you away. If you enjoyed the Oliver Stone movie - JFK, there is no doubt that you'll be glad you saw this movie. With expert testimony, from all sides of the spectrum, including the CIA, eyewitnessess, JFK authors, and more; you won't be dissappointed.The truth is the most important thing. And this film honestly seeks to find it. Displaying some haunting revelations from that fateful day, including how the mob and CIA work so closely together, it just boggles the mind that no one ever knew that JFK was at odds with so many in the gov't, CIA, and mafia.If you seek the truth, this film will put you on the right track, with the best evidence out there. Beleive me, something did go wrong on 11/22/63. Its time to find out.Enjoy this excellent movie."
5,CHEYENNE SEASON 3,THIS DVD SET IS AS GOOD AS SEASON 1 AND 2 MAYBE EVEN BETTER. THE PICTURE IS VERY CLEAR AND WOULD A GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE. I HAVE WATCHED ALL 20 SHOWS AND THEY ARE GREAT.THIS DVD SET WAS FOR SALE ON JAN 10 2012 BUT AMAZON HAS NOT RECEIVED THEIR COPIES YET. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG BUYING THIS SET WHEN IT ARRIVES TO AMAZON.
5,Cheyene The Complete 3rd Season,As we have said in reviews about the 1st and 2nd seasons we are hugh fans of Clint Walker so no surprise that we are very happy with this latest series. Thank you Amazon.
5,Cheyenne: The Complete Third Season,I enjoyed the show and think it is a very good western series that I grew up watching. I would recimmend it to all western fans.
5,Great,"Want to teach yourself Irish? This is one of the two best ways to do so, in my opinion. I have been learning Irish by myself since the early 1990s, and this has been a mainstay of my efforts."
2,Just Won't Hold Up,"I really liked the idea, but there are some weak points in the design that are catastrophic. For example, there is a tiny plastic tab that locks the ring that clips above the cable plug; it breaks easily. Also, the small plastic ring around barrel that tightens the plug against the device will not stand any hard service. Drag it across hard ground, and it will open up. And, for heaven's sake, do not step on it!This is a great idea, but it is not up to the task of professional work or heavy field service: contractor, construction, welding (what I do), etc."
3,"well written, poorly edited","I really liked this book and thought it addressed a difficult topic with sensitivity and thought. I could also see a series of books on similiar topics eg 'The widowers fiancial survival guide"", ""The young adults financial survival guede"" etc.But I was disappointed in the editing, for example on page 54 the following phrase appears ""direct exactly where your want your money to go, rather than letting in gently sift away"" ... instead of ""letting it gently sift away"". I also think page 72 was incorrect in stating that you pay more for COBRA coverage if you are older or have a preexisting condition. I think the benefit of COBRA is that you are allowed to purchase health insurnace at group rates without adjustment for age or medical condition. There are a number of similiar 'errors'.Picky, picky, picky... but overall I think this is a very useful book for a targeted audience."
4,Touched and Inspired!,"As an avid reader who has read all of Mr. Robinson's books, I related to The Perfect Blend even more than his previous works. Being married to a man with a child from a previous marriage, I'm familiar with these characters' problems, but was impressed with how the author drew me into their world. Another delight was seeing the latest adventures of O.J. from Between Brothers. I'm looking forward to Mr. Robinson's next novel. This touching, inspiring book was a relief from others with nothing productive to say."
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,What a waste of good paper. This book was so childishly writtenplease don't waste money on this book borrow it.
1,Not Enough Drama,"For a husband, a wife and a baby mama to be characterized in this book, its sure not enough drama for me.Later!!!!!"
4,Nice flip flops with this price,I really liked this flip flop... they stylish n comfortable as well.... i think worth the money....
5,happy,Super nice detail i cut a hole in the center and hung it around my light and on the ceiling above my bed i have had for many years still hasn't faded lot of compliments on it from guests
3,Not bad,"Not quite as nice as it looked in the picture, the colors aren't as bold. Otherwise, it's fine."
1,Not very fun or interesting...,"I got this kit the year before last. It looked very interesting from the packaging, but when I opened it I was not impressed. There are not very many experiments in here. The glasses were interesting for about 1 minute, until I looked through them. The dog biscuit recipe was nice, however, but the other experiments were not very interesting at all."
1,Poor Value - Look Elsewhere,"Very poor value, very little educational content. If I bought this from a local store I would return it."
3,very boring...,this is fun for about 3 minutes. after the first time you look through the glasses its a bore. the dog biscits are good but thats about it. it does have a lot of facts about dogs but i still wouldn't buy it.
3,Dog Biscuits Recipe,"So I acquired the dog biscuit mix from this kit, but not the instructions. Can anyone who decides to write a review here post the instructions for the dog biscuits?? Thanks!"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought two of these as Christmas gifts. Both the recipients were dog lovers, so I thought it was a perfect gift. What a ripoff. The whistle was a cheap plastic thing. Not the nice silver one pictured. The dog biscuit cookie cutter was also small and plastic, not like the metal one that was shown in the contents of the box. Besides these two items, there some paper glasses, dog biscuit mix and an instruction manual. It looked like about $2.00 worth of materials at most. I was so embarrassed when I saw what these children received. I do NOT recommend you send your money."
1,"No fun what-so-ever, unless doggy was raised by wolves","Stupid tricks, absolutely no fun. My dog knows much more then this so-called fun game has to offer. It might be good for people who has 2-5 year old kid and want the kid to have fun with the dog, but definitely not for you to have fun with your sophisticated and the best doggy-baby."
2,Rather silly,"I bought this because I am a watcher of the TV Sale shows. I must say it confirms the foolishness involved with my""addiction"" but it was still trite."
3,Sellevision: A Novel,"Although I usually enjoy his books, this was not one of them. I just couldn't get into it. I read it all the way through to see if it got any better, but in my opinion it didn't."
4,Funny but different.,"Augusten Burroughs is easily one of my favorite authors and while I enjoyed reading Sellevision, I found myself unsatisfied. This book is still a decent read, though I'd recommend any of Burroughs' non-fiction works over this one."
4,Great light read!!!,"This was a fun read that really spoofed the kind of media driven, superficial socitey we're surrounded in. Great characters....I got the impression that the author really knows what it's like to work in New York City. I enjoyed it a lot because I've been in advertising in New York for several years and could really identify with the character types and situations he writes of. Very funny and savy. The kind of book you can take with you on a plane and read cover to cover for a light, entertaining, quick read."
5,Reads like candy!,"Although I'm a huge Augusten Burroughs fan, this book may throw readers for a loop. Nothing like the autobiographical ""Dry"", or ""Running With Scissors"", ""Sellevision"" is a purely fictional tale, and as I recall, the first book Mr. Burroughs published.That aside, I thought the book was deliciously good fun. Impossible to put down, the pages flew by. Like reading a script for a modern soap opera, Sellevision is full of humor, tragedy and sex. Incredibly easy to read, I would reccomend this to Burroughs fans, both new and old!"
4,A Good Summer Read,"If you are a fan of Augusten Burroughs you will enjoy this light read. It is his first book and is very different from ""Running With Scissors"" in that it is fiction and set in the arena of Home Shopping via television. His dry humor is at play through out the book. He actually wrote the book in a two week time period which is an accomplishment in and of it self. So, pull up your lawn chair and have a good laugh."
5,Funniest book I've read all year!,"The third book by Augusten Burroughs is as enjoyable if not more so than his previous two. I plowed through this book in two afternoons, it was so funny I had a hard time putting it down (except when I would drop it by accident I was laughing so hard)."
4,A Good Quick Read,"What a riot! This book is my introduction to Augusten Burroughs, and it certainly won't be the last of his that I read. If you're looking for something light that entertains but doesn't demand a lot of you, Sellevision is the way to go. It's constantly funny and easy to read in just one sitting."
1,"Skip this one, read the memoirs","I'd read Dry (very good) and Running With Scissors (kinda funny, but more horrifying than anything else), so I thought I'd give this one a look, since Augusten Burroughs is obviously a talented writer. I hate that I wasted time on Sellevision: it has flat, unlikeable and unmemorable characters (except maybe Bebe and Eliot), and uninteresting and pointlessly outrageous plot developments. Even worse, sloppy editing and misspellings: ""Nieman-Marcus""? ""Kahula""? ""stands"" instead of strands? And others that I can't remember. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,pass on this,"I love this author however, this fiction novel didn't live up to his previous work. The characters just didn't hold my attention and it lacked Burroughs usual wit and humor."
1,BORED bored bored,"I usually like his books because theyre about his life, and in first person. This book, however, is written in 3rd person and I found it to be pretty boring and dissapointing. I didnt even finish reading it."
2,Lacks a likable main character,"I did not care for this book as much as Dry: A Memoir. The latter capitvated me and made me laugh out loud and was difficult to put down. Sellevision however left me wanting and I abandoned it around the halfway point.I did not find in it the sense of humor I loved in Dry. And I did not find a character that I liked and cared about and wanted to see triumph at the end. Similarly I did not find a character that I hated enough to be rooting for his or her downfall. All of the characters seem to be shallow shopaholics and I guess that just doesn't hold my interest. Let them shop their lives away, who cares?"
2,I feel let down...,"I was dissappointed with the lack of character development. I am angry that I spent seven dollars on this book. It has promise, but that's it."
3,Interesting and light.,"I found Mr. Burroughs two memiors, Dry and Running with Scissors. That is what made me want to read this book, the fact that I really enjoyed his other ones, RwS more than Dry. And I don't feel I wasted my time.I don't read that many humor books and this one really brightened my day and amused me. But it was also light and it didn't seem there was any real climax. It pokes fun at loads of people, using cliches and sterotypes. But everything seems wrapped up almost a bit too tightly.The characters are a bit too two demensional for my tastes but still amusing, which I'm sure was the intent. This book didn't really make me think, it was a bit mind numbing, but again, I think taht was part of the intent.Not a horrible book overall, a ligth read, easy to get through and a great day passer."
3,good clean fun,"This was one of my favorite fun summer reads. Not nearly as heavy as Running With Scissors, just soap-opera-y easy entertainment. It all gets tied up neatly at the end, and while that might normally bug me, I thought it was perfect for this book."
2,Everything Good Gets Slammed,"Fun idea, great writing style, but Burroughs seems to want to take down everyone in the story who is successful. So aside from some great humor, the tale spirals downward into a grave dug with spite and petty revenge.Starts out well, but ends badly. I was disappointed, since everything else he writes is spectacular."
3,"Close, but no cigar...","QVC is one of my guilty pleasures so when I came across this book and read some of the reviews posted, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, for me, it did not live up to the hype of the 5 star posts.It's definitely a light, breezy read, and it was laugh out loud funny in couple of places. At best, I would sum it up as mildly amusing.The author definitely demonstrates potential and I'm looking forward to reading his current bestseller, ""Running With Scissors"". If that book has the depth that is lacking in ""Sellevision"", I'm sure I will enjoy it. I hope that the author's obvious wit, coupled with his real-life experiences, will give his current book the continuous laugh-out-loud quality I was hoping to find in ""Sellevision""."
2,"Five star hype, two star book","No, sorry, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Interesting concept and a VERY easy read, but there's only one character (Peggy Jean) who's anything like fully formed. Likewise, too many side points are touched upon and left largely unexplored. I'm typing quickly here before I forget what the book was about."
4,pretty good for a fiction by Augusten Burroughs,"for a fiction, it is pretty good. Not as good as his memoirs, but whatever."
4,Sellevision,"Sellevision by Augusten Burroughs is a very good book. Burrroughs is a master at creating interesting and laughable characters. Sellevision is unlike many of Burroughs books in that it is fiction.The characters though are a laugh riot and the book is a very good light read. Like most of his books this one is not for the faint of heart. Just as in real life, many of his characters are offensive, but funny. This is a perfect short little book to take on vacation or read in your spare time and you will probably read it very quickly."
3,Amusing but no bite,"I am a devotee of Augusten Burroughs' other writings and read this one last. It is quite amusing but it is more in keeping with light (and, granted, very funny) satire by Dave Barry, say, than Burroughs' usual trenchant style. Therefore I would recommend it as being quite entertaining but it might disappoint those used to Burroughs' later works."
3,I Like His Non-Fiction Better,"I read Sellevision after reading Magical Thinking, You Better Not Cry, and Dry. Probably not the best idea - after my reading (and enjoying) the REAL Augusten, this book seemed lightweight. Parts were obviously drawn from the author's real life, but nothing in this book had the hard edge (or humor) of the real life accounts. It made for a fun diversion, easily read in short nibbles, but it is not representative of the fierce power or honest humor of Burroughs' gripping memoirs."
4,Pretty darn good for a first attemt!,"This is to my knowledge A.B.'s first attempt at fiction. Although engrossing and entertaining, it does however suffer from that first attempt embiance. It still has enough plot twisties and character development to make it an enjoyable read. I just love this man!"
3,Entertaining,"Enjoyable and easy to read, though I didn't find it hilarious like some of the other reviews. Found some of the characters to be quite true to life, and reflected some of the horror of TV hosts that we are subjected to on these shopping networks!Is it a great read - I would say no. Its more like a book that you would pick up to pass the time, and if you are after lightweight books, this will be one that might suit."
2,Not the best Burroughs book,"If you want to read a great Augusten Burroughs book, stick to the memoirs Running with Scissors or Dry. I had just read Dry so I wanted more from Burroughs but Sellevision left me pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. However if you are looking for some mindless fun, it may be worth your time."
3,a little disappointing,"After reading Running with Scissors and Dry, I really had high hopes for Burroughs' novel, Sellevision. Sure, it's true I wasn't crazy about Magical Thinking, but Burroughs' sense of humor is so wonderful, I thought this book would be wonderful, too.This was a great little fluff book. It's a quick fun read. But, unlike the nonfiction Running with Scissors and Dry, both which stay with the reader long after the book is finished, Sellevision is just an average novel. What makes it a bit better than the average novel is that it IS funny in lots of places-- it's laugh-out-loud funny in lots of places. It's not politically correct and it's a bit cynical. But, it's not insightful. It doesn't make you think about it for hours or days or months after you're finished. Mostly it reminded me of some of the chick-lit stuff that I've read.In summary: I enjoyed it, yes, but I don't necessarily consider reading it to be a good use of my time."
4,WELL WRITTEN SATIRE,"I liked this book. After tearing through ""Dry"" and ""Running With Scissors"" I decided to read this book. It defines black comedy, and I wouldn't be surprised if John Waters made this into a movie. It's the story of the ""celebrities"" of a home shopping network, and how they fall from grace, or fall in love, as the case may be. However, there are two characters, Leigh and Trish, that are so under developed, that one has a hard time remembering what their roles are in the book. I guessed who Peggy Jean's (the main character) stalker was half way through. If you are familiar with Augesten's previous books (""Dry"" and ""....Scissors"") you will see vague similarites to his real life in this book. The 12 Step references, the plot line with the adult male having an affair with a minor, and so on. Check it out. It's good."
4,"Raunchy, Wicked Fun","Damn, this book is nasty! Author Augustin Burroughs holds NOTHING back in his gleeful lampooning - no - HARPOONING - of the advertising business, a profession he spent many years in. The story is about several folks who work for a television shopping channel. Some are jerks and some are decent. Many twists of fate occur and mayhem ensues. To see where the chips ultimately fall, you will have to read this book. I absolutely could not put this book down and read almost all of it in one sitting.I also recommend Burrough's sobering yet humorous memoir, Dry"
4,Hysterical!,"This book made me want to watch the shopping networks - just for the humor of it all. (And no, I've never watched or bought before.) Everything in the story is described as if it were for sale, including the characters. I couldn't put this book down and ended up finishing it in one afternoon. A very entertaining laugh at the shopping mentality and the people behind it. ""Get your order in soon -- this item is sure to sell out quickly!"""
