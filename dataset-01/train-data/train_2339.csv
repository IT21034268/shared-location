2,Disappointing,"This purchase was to replace the identical Cuisinart frying pan I had purchased a few years ago. It was damaged when I dropped a heavy pan on it, marring the non-stick surface. It turns out, this pan is not quite identical to its predecessor. I do not know where this pan was manufactured;(the predecessor was stamped ""made in China""), but this pan had no identification of its source of manufacture. I noted it felt lighter when picked up. I have also discovered the quality of its non-stick surface is not as good as the former pan. I frequently use it to cook omelets, and have found they often partially adhere to the surface when attempting to slide the omelet from the pan onto a plate to fold over, requiring an assist from a spatula. I am sure there are better alternatives available."
3,"Well,...for a while, maybe.","I really don't expect this to last very long, as most of these non-sticks tend to wear out fairly quickly. This pan lacks any heft and just feels a little cheap, which, at the price, it IS. It has a nice double bottom and the Stainless Steel is a nice feature and look butit's very thin walled and just doesn't have a serious feel to it. I use non-stick only for breakfast eggs so it's not a pan that's going to get heavy use. Still, it's kind of a let down. Not worth recommending."
3,12 in 722-30HNS CUISINART,"Great pan, even heat and good balance. 3 stars because you can not get a lid that fits this 12 inch pan, not even at the Cuisinart site. The lip has a bevel so I guess that's why there is no Lid available."
4,Surprisingly Good!,This pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops. They were moist and nicely browned. Very easy clean up. The lightness makes the pan very easy to handle and to flip the food. The helper handle and stainless handle is the same great Cuisinart quality. Love these products. This is a great addition.
4,Great Nonstick Skillet,"This pan looks great, cooks everything well, and is super easy to clean in the dishwasher. A wonderful purchase!"
4,Skillet,"We fry eggs and bacon every morning and have worn out several aluminum ""Teflon"" coated pans. We love the stainless steel and with the aluminum core it seems to cook more evenly. We are careful with this one, hand-washing it lightly with soap and water after each use. We hope the hard anodized interior will last a long time. I studied online the best cookware and some were way out of our budget, with 4 or more plies. This one seems fine for our daily residential use."
5,Wonderful Kitchen Helper,"This is the best thing in my kitchen! I love the size, the two handles, and ease of cleaning!"
1,Worst remote ever used,"Bought this remote online at amazon.com and received it within 2 days but the actual remote only lasted 3 weeks before it totally stopped working completely. I thought it was the batteries although new batteries were installed but that wasn't the problem. For the few short weeks that it worked it actually did work on all my devices. I wouldn't recommend this remote to anyone. I had to eventually come back to amazon to get a one-for-all, the one I had originally intended to get."
5,Wow!,"This song is an absolute must for all club heads! It is absolutely amazing and its beat is infectious. I had so much trouble finding this song, but now that I've found it I would like to recommend it to all of you out there!"
2,It's OK.........if you like that stuff.,"It's, without a doubt, a new spin on an old classic. But it really doesn't do the old tune any justice. If you're into the techno-dance thing, than you would enjoy this. Myself.....I'm old school. I don't mind a ""tune-up"", but all I ask is that you be true to the original song."
5,Simply the best.,"Wiha simply makes the best precision screwdrivers on the market. If you own a watch, if you own glasses, if you own anything with small screws do yourself a favor and get yourself a set of Wiha precision screwdrivers."
2,Not scary stories...,"I love Nancy Collins work, but was VERY dissapointed in this book. The only good story is the first one, Hell COme Sundown, was in my opinion the only one worth reading. The 3rd story, Walking WOlf, was sooo hard to get through as it was just a story of a white Native American Werewolf and his woes. Very boring and loooong. This is just a book with a few dramas in it, not scary or even interesting. Pooh! The only great thing is the paper its printed on looks like a deck of cards. That was unique."
5,An interdisciplinary revelation,"This book, published in 1920, was a seminal influence on both T.S. Eliot in ""The Wasteland"" and Ernest Hemingway in ""The Sun Also Rises"". Eighty years later, it's still easy to see why. Although the book is short-just over 200 pages-it is almost unbelievably wide-ranging. As she deconstructs the elements of the various versions of the tales of the Holy Grail, Ms. Weston takes the reader globetrotting and time-traveling, from Vedic India to turn of the century Africa and Japan, with stops in between in Europe and the Middle East from antiquity to her own time. She relates the Grail stories to archaic sacred kingship, fertility rituals and dances, the rites and myths of Adonis, Attis and Mithra, as well as Gnostic Christianity. If you're interested in the Grail, the history of western culture, the history of religious ideas, or the transmission of myth and ritual into literary forms, ""From Ritual To Romance"" is truly a revelation."
1,The formatting is rubbish,The formatting is rubbish. Every line of the book is broken in half. For heaven's sake this should be blindingly obvious to any reviewer. Appalling that it is allowed for sale. I shall be seeking refund. I bought the other avaiable edition - which has proper formatting.
4,Savannah Community Choir,I like gospel music and my Pastor's wife told me about the song and I pulled it up and listened to it and liked what I heard. I think this is one I will be listening to a lot.
3,It's like a slightly worse version of Vietcong,"In terms of atmosphere and realistic-feeling gameplay Vietcong did everything they did in this game slightly better. This particular game has a few elements Vietcong didn't have and which arguably could have had in order to be a better game, like characters building skills through experience. I personally am a huge sucker for Vietnam War games so I was very happy to play it and would recommend it for any Vietnam War game fans. Probably most people would just grumble and say the game sucks though if they get distracted by the fact the gameplay is mediocre at best."
4,This Awesome Doll,The doll has beautiful hair which I love to play w/. The doll also looks alot like my myscene doll Nolee. So it is easy to play their sisters. Thanks alot for the great doll!
5,Jade is the best!,"As usual Jade is the ''Punk Princess'' of the party. I think Jade is the best Bratz doll because I love her jet black hair and punk rock style. If you wanna buy a Jade doll this is the one!Seeya,Michelle"
5,Best Jade Ever Made!,"I always thought that Strut it Jade was the coolest Jade until....I found out what this one was like! Her clothes are really cool and she's more....Her than some of the other dolls! The only problem is, her earings are tiny. this was my first bratz with earings, and I diddn't know that the earings came out so when I did, It was too late! Anyway, Jade is cooler than my other 2 Bratz. I reccomend you buy HER!!"
1,its stupid,i don't know why you people waist your time on the bratz and myscene thier just a bunch of sluts. if you want a cool and educational toy you need to by a gi-joe not these slut toys.gi-joe is so cool that he will blow you away. so stop waisting your money on lame toys that are slutty.and gi-joe is so cool that he wages war and takes over the world and the only thing bratz and myscene takes over is the runway. and gi-joe is so cool that he can knock bratz and myscene into a month of sundays.p.s i am a friend of jans daughter
2,"UGLY , UGLY , UGLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This doll is obviously not worth it's money . The hair is terrible ,The outfit isn't even close to stylish ,and her make up is messed up .Blech!"
2,I like bratz but the funk out collection have UGLY clothes,"BRATZ FASHION DONTS: FLASHBACK FEVER,SLUMBER PARTY,NIGHTY NITE,TOKYO A GO GO,WILD LIFE SAFARI,FUNK OUT except for NEVRA and FIANNA!!!!!!!!COOL BRATZ:FORMAL FUNK,GIRLS NITE OUT,FUNK N GLOW(out of stock) and Style it YASMIN.DONT GET ME WRONG I LOVE BRATZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!-BRIANNAH"
5,"Get a Grip, please!!!","Ok, first off, some people aren't even rating the doll. You people need to stop talking about my scenes.Second off, this doll is gorgeous (as you can see in the picture i submitted) her hair is pretty!And as for you ""worried"" people who think you or your friend will be infulenced by a doll then you are stupid because a doll can't make you anorxic and Bratz don't always dress up like they are going clubbing(now myscene is starting to act that way).THIS DOLL IS NOT GOTHIC!! if you want gothic, look at the Midnight dance dolls (which are still pretty anyway.) If she were goth she would have all black on.So i suggest you people who are doing this get on with your lives because it's getting annoying."
2,bratz dolls,"Bratz have so many negative aspects. They probably have good aspects too but I can't think of any, can you? My friend used to be annarexic. Can you guess why? She saw these bratz dolls and saw how skinny they are and how they were pretty because of it, and she wanted to be popular. She was my best friend and it really hurt to watch her go through what she did. Don't encourage kids to buy these horrible bony bratz, because what if kids decided to become annerexic too?"
1,Bratz,"This is the most gothic looking doll I have ever seen anywhere! Out of any brand of doll ever made, bratz are the most gothic and evil. I don't see why parents are buying these things for their kids! Do they want their kids to be gothic or something?"
1,Silverfast US Technical Support As of Dec. 2012,"This is a horrible company to try and get support from. I bought a very expensive scanner that the software does not now support even though it came with it. I've upgraded per their website, emailed, called their support lines and can get no where with them. Amazon should not sell their products and you should not buy one!If there was a less than one star rating I'd be using it!"
1,SilverFast SE,"An extremely disappointing product; in fact, the most disappointing I've EVER purchased on Amazon. The ap installs on my PC's, but will not open. The SilverFast web site says there is a free update available, but even though the product is registered in my name, the ""Free update"" is NOT accessible, will NOT download and is virtually useless. The SilverFast web site is one of the worst and least helpful I've ever run across in my 15 years of working with PC's."
2,Disappointing - still searching for answers,"I was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real-life situations. I felt most of the book talked about how to parent, i.e. cosleeping, wearing baby, etc, but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation. What do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when I pick him up? I don't want to spank, but a 24-month old just doesn't take to ""a talk"" or timeout like Dr. Sears says he should. The Sears Birth Book was amazing, I recommend it to anyone, but this book did not help me answer my questions."
2,I WANTED to like this book,"but it offered no real practical advice beyond common sense approaches. Plus, Sears et al seemed to believe that if you practice their attachment parenting approach you should avoid all disipline problems. Well, that's not terribly realistic.I really loved the Baby Book and often purchase it for my new mommy friends, but this book won't be part of my recommended reading list."
2,Author appears to be extremely sexist and classist.,"While much of the advice in this book is quite useful, it is difficult to get beyond the author's outdated views of gender roles within the parenting relationship. The author bases theories and notions on the assumption that mothers stay at home and take primary responsibility for care of the child. This book completely ignores the economic realities of most american families, as well as the desire or more and more fathers to take an active role in their child's life. The author writes to an all white, all middle class, all traditional gender roles audience, which is not the reality for most of us."
1,"If you aren't AP, don't get this book!","If you didn't breastfeed or carry your child around almost 24/7 in infancy don't get this book. I had never heard of attachment parenting and didn't get this book until my oldest was 3. Wow, talk about trying to make you feel like crap. This is not the book for parents of older toddlers who are at their wits ends and want to read a book about discipline. Get something else, but don't waste your money on this. Unless of course you are a hardcore AP person and you believe everything Dr.Sears says."
2,Not for children under 1,"Our child's under one, and just getting to the discipline stage. There's nothing for a child under age one, unless you want to be told the value of attachment parenting (which I do not believe in). I've got a successful ""Baby Whisperer"" child so far. I'm keeping the book (I got it as a gift), but only because when I skipped around, it seemed to have some advice we might find useful when our child's older. If I hadn't have gotten it as a gift, I wouldn't have bought it because of the attachment philosophy, but I'm new to the world of discipline techniques so I'll keep it."
1,"Not only won't help, will HARM!","This book teaches you how to raise completely dependent children who have no control over themselves and know how to manipulate their parents!! It is written by a man who had no father growing up and didn't even know his first 3 children because he worked so much. True story, it's in the book.If you are looking for a practical book on parenting and child discipline, tryTo Train Up A Childby Michael and Debi Pearl. It is short and to the point so even very busy parents have time to read it and put it into practice. I have 3 boys 5,3 and 2 and I started seeing wonderful results in just a few days!! I guarantee it will change your family's life."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"Since I had bought and loved ""The Baby Book,"" i tried the Discipline book, hoping to get some good ideas on how to discipline my then-2 year old. I was very disappointed in this book. Most of the book seems like a glorified autobiography on how wonderful Dr. Sears and Martha are at raising their kids. And the book lacks any real advice. Most of the advice is ""start out connected to your child and then you will know how to handle trantrums/hitting/biting/screaming."""
3,No real practical advice,"I am a big fan of attachment parenting and applaud Dr. Sears for his work. The Discipline Book, while offering plenty of do's and don'ts, didn't offer up enough alternatives. My child never fell for distraction, even as an infant! I didn't feel satisfied after reading this book. Worse, I felt like I had to be a perfect machine. I recommend The Mr. Rogers Parenting Book - Helping to Understand Your Young Child by Fred Rogers. It offers advice for real parents with real children in very real situations."
5,the discipline book for me and my child,"This is exactly the book that I need. The information's just match with my need as a new parent. I like the way the information is shared just like a parent tells another parent about their children's behavior, but only this parent is a very reliable and trusted parent, and will always be there every time you need them."
4,good info,"I would love to give a long explanation on this book but I think I would bore you. To sum it up it is a good resource to own and read. But, there is always an but, if you want to save money just but Sears's Baby book. It is everything in one book. Anaother great resaource is his Fussy baby book. This is a must. The discipline book is basically a chapter out of his Baby book.What every you decide Sears is a excellent resource and more people should adopt his parenting advice. If they did there would be a lot more nicer people in this world as a whole."
5,Such a wonderful reference for such a wonderful book!,"My husband and I purchased this book when it first came out. We were skeptical at first, but soon came to realize that Dr. Sears' ideas hit the nail on the head. He is so caring for children and reminds us that discipline is a life long teaching not just a ""please the parents now"" theory. We hope that we can raise caring and nurturing parents for our future grandchildren."
2,Not worth the Read,"This book was a disappointment. There are no practical tips for disciplining your child -- it is more about why you should be using the Attachment Parenting method of child rearing and if you aren't, why you should be. The author does discuss several of the different styles of discipline, but he lacks any sort of objectivity. Not to mention there is not a single fact or statistic to support his arguments. I do not recommend this book if you are looking for a good, practical guide on disciplining your child."
2,Help for working moms?,"Does anyone write a good discipline book for working mothers? I enjoyed Dr. Sears' Pregnancy Book and bought this looking for advice as my 21-month old son gets older. However, in addition to many of the criticisms already expressed (little practical advice, holier-than-thou, etc.) this book is based on the premise that the mother stays at home with the child. While I believe in SOME of the tenets of attachment parenting, I went back to work when my son was 12 weeks old. I refuse to believe that my (and my husband, since he is an integral part of raising our child - unlike the assumption of this book) discipline efforts are doomed just because I ""weaned"" my child from attachment too early. I will keep looking for a more applicable book."
3,Sears knows best?,"I purchased this book because it appeared to be one that looked at discipline and the child in a very practical way. Though I found some of the information helpful, there were many instances of highly judgemental advice offered. I had expected to see a variety of approaches, all imformed by the basic tenets of attachment parenting, but felt some of the advice was not really applicable, specifically the section on dealing with sleep problems with young children."
3,I love Dr Sears but only liked this book,"I am a huge believer in attachment parenting, but found this book to be a dollar short and way to late. I bought it when my son was 18 months old and reading it felt like I had already made tons of mistakes that wern't reversable as a parent. This book may be more helpful for ""parents-to-be"" or brand new parents. I also felt like some of the expectations were a little high... all in all I thought that the ideas and the general guidlines were good, just not many examples to help."
5,My favorite Dr. Sears Book by FAR!,"This book is a must have for any new parents. Who wouldn't like a method of parenting that can actually help PREVENT some of the headaches and misbehaviors? Rather than putting all the focus on the PUNISHMENT angle of discipline, Dr. Sears has given an approach that looks as discipline as the whole package of raising healthy happy children. I recommend you purchase and read this book while pregnant, as raising successful healthy children begins from day one, not just when they are old enough for punishing. Discipline, as clearly demonstrated in this book, has nothing to do with PUNISHMENT, but with child rearing as a whole."
2,a working mom,"Dr Sears completely ignores the HUGE population of working mothers! The book goes on and on and on about attachment parenting and how you should allow your child to disattach from you and not the other way around....well, the majority of the mother's in this world do not have this choice! Furthermore, he made me feel as though I was a selfish mother for not carrying my daughter on my hip for the first year of her life. My daughter is very attached to me and we have a very close relationship....yet I started back at work full time when she was 8 weeks old. I feel that Dr Sears only addressing those mothers that stay at home full time and even then he cautions about leaving your child! Easy for him to say!!!!"
3,Love Dr. Sears - Love others for discipline more though,I have been a fan of the Dr. Sears parenting library and have most of the volumes. This one follows right along but I recommmend Dr. Ray Gaurendi et al for real parenting advice when it comes to discipline.
2,Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of the baby book, and I have to say I was really disappointed when I read this one. It's like it's written for people who can't think for themselves. The advice and explanations given in this book were things I take for granted that all parents understand. Either that or I'm a perfect mother- (and I know I'm not.) Buy something else instead- unless you don't really have a clue."
3,"It was somewhat useful, but not a cure-all.","I found some of the suggestions useful. For example I was able to minimize getting into the yelling/spanking routine. Others (most) were idealstic and unrealistic. For example, for most situations the authors suggest talking calmly and gently to your child but I that is impossible when a toddler is screaming at the top of his lungs for 30 minutes and can't even hear anything being said! I found that some guidelines were too permissive for our family. I disagree with their advice to apologize to your children when you get angry-it makes parents look weak and out of control. I also think this book could leave some parents feeling inadequate because no parent is calm and rational 100% of the time."
3,Not impressed,"While I found this book somewhat helpful, I felt it was lacking in advice for single and/or working mothers. I agree with the reader who said that the book did not give much advice when dealing with practical situations. In my opinion, most of this book was just plain common sense. I think this book should have done more to teach parents succesful ways to implement parenting strategies rather than just vomiting them back to us."
5,Great Beans,When making homemade beans it is a pleasure to have a variety of beans and trhis is a very special dish knowiung it is of natural organic products
3,Thought they'd be heat and eat...,"Brought them to a boil with some bacon drippings, then simmered a few minutes. Really couldn't eat them - they were hard as if they needed to be cooked several more hours. I've bought Eden dry pinto beans and know that they have to be cooked a long time or done in a pressure cooker but I expected these to be something like Luck's beans-open the can, then heat and eat, but no. I doubt that I'll buy these again since I was looking for convenience."
4,very interesting and detailed,"all i can say is i loved it, the whole book focused on the titanic and thats what i was looking for. i have a copy at home and it is always interesting for me to read.i've read it four times so far and it is still awesome. i sugggest that you try it.although there were parts i did skip because i wasn't interested and felt they could leave it out but other then that it was great.try it yourself and see how you feel about it."
1,Miracle-Gro Shake'n feed Rose Plant Food,Disappointed in this Miracle-Gro product. I used as instructed and did not see any significant result. Not one of my better buys...
1,NOT ALL EPISODES,"The product information for this box set proudly boasts ""includes all 43 original episodes of the first three seasons"". Season 1 had 14 episodes, season 2 had 19 episodes and season 3 had 12 episodes. This makes a total of 45. The final two episodes from season 1 are the anomalies here. ""Search for ET"" and ""Beyond the Big Bang"", are the climax to the first season and the most interesting of the first season and are somewhat inexplicably missing. Where are the missing episodes?? Such a shame as this is a very interseting series and should have been a 5 star product, but due to the omitted 2 crucial parts I can only award the 1."
2,So-so audio quality and below par performance,"I bought this kit in hopes of using it as my main headphones and of course as a hands free for my cell phone. Well, the audio quality is below average : vitually no bass, hard to listen in noisy environments, outside sound leaks in and the volume doesn't go that loud. Also the unit I received (brand new) malfuncioned, sound didn't come from both speakers. When using it as a hands free for my Sony Ericsson W600, it pairs ok, but people tell me i sound like a robot (when it works at all). So I would say, look elsewhere."
2,Don't buy solely for cell phones,"These paired right away with my VX9800, I could hear the beeping and such, but when the time came to listen to music, the music played out of phone's speakers, not the headphones. Thus far, I've read nothing good about these headphones and cell phones, so, if it's cell phone head phones you seek, look elsewhere. As for their worth otherwise, they work quite well when using just on my computer, very fun. The range is decent, not as far as I'd hoped, but decent. After wearing for about an hour, they start to hurt. They fit very snugly and comfortably otherwise. However, they look somewhat ridiculous in that the phones look like two eggs attached to the side of your head. There are better things out there."
4,"Great for Ipod, useless for cell phone","Great sound quality for listening to music, very good wireless range. It is also very easy to use, just plug it in and turn it on. It also comes with both a USB and an AC charger. Howver, I can not get a consistent connection with my Blackberry. So buy it only if you plan on using it for listening to music."
1,Junk -- and no support.,"Three gripes:1) It broke after 2 weeks. The left channel doesn't transmit. It is a transmitter issue, as I've tried replacing the cable.2) The tech support / warranty response was non-existent. I emailed the support contact on the web site and no response. Emailed them again and still no response.3) Major issue for me, but likely not for most people -- there is a delay in the signal broadcast. I wanted to use these headphones to play my guitar, but I hear the sound coming through at a 1 second delay, so it is impossible to play real time."
2,Don't waste your money,"When using this headset with my MP3 player it sounds OK (just OK) and has pretty good range......but that's not the main reason why I bought it. I needed a headset for my LG CG300 cell phone, and at more than $150 off retail I thought this would be a great bargain.The person on the other end of the conversation can barely hear you talk, and the sound of your voice is both muffled and distorted. On your end it really isn't much better. It's pretty much unusable with a cell.I gave it 2 stars because it isn't horrible with my MP3 player but it ain't too good either. For the cell phone though.......it's junk."
1,Not for cell phones!!!,"Even though this thing was made for cellphones and use with other stuff, it does not pair with cell phones as stereo headphones! It just works as a headset, even then the mic is horrible,but will not connect with my fusic no matter how much I try. it's only okay for use with computers and mp3 players."
2,short battery life,"this is a nice set of headphones, good range, good quality, nice ergonomics. The bluetooth transmitter on the ground is not the best solution but it is ok. My problem with these headphones is power consumption. They go out in a couple ours (both transmitter and headphones must be recharged) even if you do not hear any music. I do not understand how this is happening unless they didn't do a good job in making the design low power -basic techniques are adequate at this level . I haven't tested them with cell phones."
3,not what it seems,"Maybe it is me but the item is not what I thought I was getting. The ""pattern"" is not a full complete template.'What you get is a piece of MDF with 4 small patterns cut out. Then you need to mount this to the wood to cut out the pattern. Well 1/4 of the pattern, they require you to rotate and flip the pattern over and over to get the complete pattern transfered and routed out. I was looking for one solid pattern, clamp it down and cut away.Too much flipping and rotating for what it is. BAD part is it cost more to return the item postage was more than the cost, so I placed it in the ""pile"" of bad decisions.Some may want to mess with it, I don't, Robert in San Jose"
3,Still Not Sure,"Well the controller itself is pretty comfortable and fits my hands much better than the Sony controller. However, after a few days of trying to get it to work, I have yet to do so. The controller will not sync with the receiver - it just won't! I am currently in the process of contacting Madcatz's tech support, so we'll see if my controller gets replaced or if I get a refund. I like Madcatz and was excited to give this controller a try, but no luck yet."
4,"Clunky, but it works.","If your looking for an extra controller on your PS3 and don't wanna shell out 50 bones for a Sony brand controller, this is the one for you. It's just as effective and reliable as the Sony brand only devoid of a few perks. It needs to have a wireless receiver plugged into the usb slot in order to work and it needs AA batteries to function (although it has a decent battery life span). It's bulkier than the Sony brand, but it works just fine and is ideal for having that extra controller around for multiplayer games."
2,Battery Drainer,"This controller seems to work fine, except that it drains battery like crazy. If you accidentally forget to turn off the controller after you're done playing, most likely when you return the batteries will be drained. Not good if you have kids since they never remember."
1,Poor quality,This controller worked for about a month and then stopped connecting to the PS3. Tech support from the company is basically non-existent. So save your receipt or spend a little extra to by a real Sony controller.
1,Worst controller ever,"ok where to start....well first of all the ink wore off every button within a week, so if you don't know which button is x [] O ^ then you are screwed. controller only syncs to the ps3 1 out of about 4 times so u gotta restart the ps3 and controller multiple times. the analog sticks are more slippery than ice so your thumbs will be constantly falling off them. the start and select button are wedged as close to the sticks as possible so its almost impossible to push them in. this controller does not have a batter pack and uses two AAA batteries that will last about 4 hours if you get the best batteries in the world. many times you will be playing and the screen will start moving upward by itself, its time to restart the controller.I can't think of the other multiple problems with this controller but I think you get the picture.this controller is a piece of garbage and should not be purchased by ANYONE. Unless it drops to 4.99. even then i am not so sure0 stars."
3,"Fast shipping, cute item, but not properly packaged.","These sprinkles are absolutely adorable and the seller shipped them incredibly fast (ordered on a Friday afternoon and they were in my mailbox on Monday). I'm glad I ordered 2 because of the lack of details about the size of the item and I will be using these sprinkles at a birthday party's ""ice cream bar"" and will need two, if not more, containers. My only issue with this item is the fact that it comes in an unsealed container. It's nerve wracking not knowing if these are contaminated, whose hands have touched them, where exactly they come from... I plan on testing them out to see if I get sick or not before I plan on feeding them to a dozen toddlers. Disappointed, to say the least. And a little grossed out."
3,"""High Quality Paperback"" Format","This High Quality Paperback edition is the first I've purchased, and had I been familiar with the format I think I would have bought a different edition. The book is the size of a standard sheet of copy or typing paper (~8""x11""), which I think is a bit large for a paperback book--but my fault for not reading the description more carefully. The pages look ""typed,"" not ""printed."" It's not so easy to read as the usual fonts seen in books, and coupled with the size of the book, well, as I said, I think I would have chosen a different edition. Excellent story though!"
4,a good solid read,This is the first book that I have read by Anna Kathearine Green but it won't be the last. A thoroughly enjoyable mystery with good character development and story line. You can't miss with this!
5,!!!!!!!!!,"Wow, what a gem. A marvelous fusion of traditional Etheopian music and funk which works on every level."
4,Drinking?,"If you are my age (mid-thirties) then this collection of extended play classics will conjure images of only one thing:Drinking in college.Apart from the regrettable ommision of an extended cut of ""Road to Nowhere,"" this collection hits on every hot track from ""Little Creatures,"" and ""True Stories.""If you went to NIU, you are attempting to refill a Growler Bucket while not loosing track of some girl who only calls you while she's drunk, and loves the song ""And She Was.""These Talking Head songs were tailor made to be stretched and syncopated, and this collection is nicely mastered are artfully aranged.Such fun.So, 4-stars sober, 5 after a bucket or two."
3,The Fourth Season,I found The Fourth Season to be a light charming read. I enjoyed the author's sense of humor especially and the book moved nicely along. It was a nice little escape!
2,Poor Material in the Anti Chop Bolt,"Less then 100 shots into the Marker, and the Slide on the Anti Chob Bolt Snapped off. This is the same that I have seen in the reviews from other websites. Unfortionatly I did not read that before purchase. I did not purchase through this website or seller, but wanted to warn people about the quality of this gun."
4,Spoiled Dog,"I'm trying to train our Bishon to sleep in his own bed. It hasbeen a little problem as he is really used to sleeping with us.He will stay in the bed for most of the night, but I do find himwith my husband and me by morning.He's quite comfortable napping in it while I'm on the computer andit is very large. I possibly could have gotten a smaller one butour Beau is a very large Bishon (26# and taller and longer thanhe should be.) I'm planning to add a small throw to see if that helps."
3,Falls short of its predecessor,"If you've never read ""The Power of Style"" then you'll enjoy this peek into the lives of Hollywood Glams. But somehow this book lacked the cache' of the other. Perhaps it was not the writing (or perhaps it was), but the subjects themselves who disappointed. Unlike the subjects of ""Style"", the women of ""Glamour"" leave you unimpressed, and vaguely disturbed. Although they're somewhat entertaining, these women do not inspire imitation, but pity. Most of them were about flash, not substance. The lesson here is that it's definitely better to have style than glamor, and better to read about style, too."
4,"A show-and-tell definition of the word ""glamour"".","This is a mesmerizing trip into the characters of eleven women who helped create the mythology of the Hollywood ""movie star"" and paved the way for all who came after. You'll read about some fascinating women - the real woman behind the ""star"" - and learn just how each one worked her own particular brand of magic. The beautiful photographs are not same old ones you see in every retrospective. Read about one ""star"" at a time and let her haunt your thoughts (and wardrobe decisions) for a few days before reading on!"
2,Seriously lacking,"This book is seriously lacking in that no compendium of Hollywood style is complete without 60's icon Audrey Hepburn or the lovely Miss Marilyn Monroe who exemplified 50's glamour. Not as good as its predecessor ""The Power of Style"" which included that other 60's icon the gracious Jackie O'..."
3,Dated,"I tried this out after seeing it on the bookshelf of a friend. Mostly, the humor is very dated, and having read Robert Benchley years ago, I disagree with the comment that McManus is his ""outdoor equivalent"". The vignettes are often not very engaging and seem to be like a stand-up comic trying to stretch a joke too far.It has some pretty humorous lines, and that's what makes the whole work just okay."
5,The Good Samaritan Strikes Again,Product was in great condition and full of great stories as all Patrick McManus books are. Fun for the whole family.
2,amount of heat is almost imperceptible!,"Although these mittens are very comfortable and have excellent grips, the amount of heat generated by the electronic set-up is almost imperceptible. You have to have a good imagination to believe it is actually working!"
3,like them,wish they still had the smaller battery pack instead of the D battery. The ones I have for myself use the AA batteries and the pack in smaller and lighter
1,Just not what I expected,"Purchased a pair for both me and my wife. We used them last winter, which was not all that cold but it was below freezing (Texas), and for us it doesn't take much to be cold. Lots of comments about the battery and bulkiness and they are true. We failed to notice any appreciable amount of heat from either of our pair of gloves and ended up using chemical handwarmers. They are decent plain old gloves, but if I were searching for a pair of heated gloves I would stress you keep searching. Really disappointed in these and my wife was heart broken that cold morning."
1,Did nothing at all,"Don't buy this item. it does none if the things it promises> buy regular gloves and save yourself some money. Extremelly disappointed costumer. plus it uses a ""D"" size battery."
2,They're ok,The thinsulate and nylon covering probably provide as much warmth as the batteries. Really can't tell too much difference with the batteries in or out.
3,Okay,"Glove is made of good material. It does not get hot enough. One gloves gets warmer than the other. I'm not even sure if the righthand glove works. But overall its not bad. If I could, I would invest in something else."
2,Very little heat,I bought both the Nordic Gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens. Neither product provides adequate heat. The batteries work; but you get only a tiny bit of warmth. I see from the other reviews that my complaint is common. I wish I had read the reviews before buying!
2,Lame,Well...I bought these gloves thinking they'd help me when I went skiing...they didn't do a darned thing...they kept the palms of the hands lukewarm but my fingers still froze. I guess it goes to show you can't expect quality out of something that costs so little.
2,no heat in the right place.,"only heats the palm of your hand, fingers stay cold. No elements in the fingers of the glove, only heating element is in the palm of your hand. Not worth the money,"
3,"good show, my DVD has technical issues","the DVD I got only works on the computer, not the dvd player for the tv. but it was pretty cheap so I am okay with it. My son likes the Madeline shows, I also like it since it has the European flair."
5,A great reference,The industrial handbook of diamond and diamond films is the most comprehensive text on the subject of industrial diamond available. I would rate it as the finest available and highly recommend it. It is well thought out and well written. It is obvious that a great deal of work and care went into the preparation of the text. I have used it as a reference text extensively over the past year and it has been outstanding. This text has saved me hundreds of hours.
1,Riddled with holes,"I have been working through this book with my husband (C Mills) - he's experienced and I'm a beginner.I have found many errors and it seems obvious it was originally written for an earlier version of Java. If it weren't for my husband's expertise and other reference materials I would have given up with sheer frustration. Some of the things they say just don't work in Java 2, others are plain wrong (warnings that Java would throw errors in certain circumstances when it doesn't, for e.g.) and some simple, basic things (like ASCII code 62 for A, it's actually 65) show the inexperience of the authors.The book needs serious proof-reading, updating and editing (e.g. the simple exercises on a topic should come BEFORE the complicated ones) and then it could become a good book.The 4-and-a-half star rating I found here is wrong - no doubt an anomoly caused by the very small sample it was created from."
1,don't buy it,"this book was so poorly edited as to make the information the authors present difficult to understand. no little problems either. for instance entire sections are duplicated; section titles are repeated with new information. not worth reading for anyone, especially a new programmer."
4,Book was used and the story is great,This book was used like they stated but the story is a great one about Homestake Gold MIne. Though it stops in 1975 and not when the mine closed in 2002 was disappointing. The story of Homestake tells of mine fires and trying to use the latest equipment to get gold out of a deep mine over 7000 feet deep. I grow up in the Black Hills so it was great to hear Homestakes's story.
5,Full bass at a good price,This is a great addition to my book shelf Fluance speakers. So glad that there is speaker equipment out there of this quality for these prices. Be sure to get the speaker wire at time of purchase as it is not included.
4,powerful enough,"Looks really good, nice blue glow 'on' light. Fairly loud without being boomy. Good adjustment for volume and frequency crossover point. As good as Infinity or Polk and priced lower."
1,Bearbooks Misleading Item Description,"The item description is as follows:""Phyllis A Whitney Novels: Ten Novels: Silverhill, Hunter's Green, The Winter People, Listen For The Whisperer, Snowfire, Spindrift, The Stone Bull, Ponciana, Emerald, Dreams of Orchids, Flaming Tree, Woman Without A Past""Vendor is bearbooksThis description indicates the product includes TEN (10) novels for the price ($28.99)- Thise price would be consistent with other online prices of $3-5 per book for used booksWhat is delivered is actualy only ONE (1) book - not 10 -This product description is completely inaccurate and misleading - Nowhere in the product description is there any indication that the product is a single book instead of the specifically itemized ten booksThis vendor should not be allowed to continue with this deceptive advertising practice"
5,Praise for BookRescue,"I have a beautiful, pristine copy that was exactly as described in the Amazon website. We are very pleased with this seller and will look for her books in the future."
2,Sound Problems,"The set of dvds had some episodes with little or no sound. I exchanged it for another set and found the same problems on the same episodes. I believe that the master from which these dvds were made was bad. I was dissatified with the dvds, but not with the amazon experience since I had no trouble returning the dvds nor in receiving a full refund including my shipping costs to return both sets of dvds."
2,More bootleg quality stuff,"The original (currently deleted) Amos 'n' Andy Show Platinum Edition was a 70-plus show box set of 16 DVDs. Episodes were dubbed from SLP tapes of TV broadcasts. Most were overly blurry and had weak audio.Don't expect anything more from this current smaller gathering.Sadly, there is no definitive Amos & Andy collection, and may never be. It's a shame too, for these Charles Barton directed shows were darn good (some were scripted by Paul Henning of laterBEVERLY HILLBILLIES/PETTICOAT JUNCTION/GREEN ACRES)fame)."
3,Interesting,"It was worth reading, but I'm not sure I liked it. The characters weren't all there for me, I had a hard time liking Garnet and the others. It was a quick easy read, with enough humor to keep me going. I'll take another chance with the next one and make my decision to continue or not."
4,Interesting read,"Apart from the main character's extreme horniness from the beginning of the book up until the point she actually got sex, this book was good. Garnet's character seemed very eager for intimacy when she met vampire Sebastian. It seemed like every other sentence she was thinking about touching Sebastian or making love to him or picturing him naked. However, after she finally did the deed with him, the story grew into quite a good read. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next two books in the Garnet Lacey series."
3,Garnet Lacey Series,"I read this whole series. It was obviously interesting enough to keep me reading so that i could know how it all ended. I dont regret it. I wasnt in love with this series but it did keep me entertained. I guess i wasnt higly impressed with Sebastion. His character seemed to be missing some passion. Anyhow it was a series of momentarily satifactory, entertaining short reads....I enjoyed it, but i wouldnt do it again."
5,EAGER FOR MORE!,I love all 3 of miss Hallaway's books. I like the idea of the paranormal romance. This one was fun. Vampire lovers and vatican agents. YAY! I can't wait for DEAD IF I DO comes out!
5,Great book,"Loved this book! It seems a few readers here have left some negative comments regarding the character's, well, character. I enjoyed the fact that the characters aren't perfect and have flaws, just like real people. Maybe readers looking for the ""Mary Sue"" type of character should look for the cookie cutter, happy ending type of books and avoid books like this that are a little darker and complex. Personally, I am looking forward to the second and third books in this series."
3,Just okay....,"I liked the basic premise of this book but I thought it would be more fun. The characters were not very engaging. I did not really care if they survived. I would have liked to see more of Matyas. They cast him as the villain but he was the only one I remotely cared about. I felt more for his situation than any of the others. If there is a sequel, I hope the main characters develop a better conscience."
4,Spicy And Strait Forward,"Tate Hallaway is a great new author to add to my never ending collection of books. This book is spicy and very strait forwarding in the sexual thinking department. It kind of leaves you with you mouth hanging open and wondering ""Do girls or even I really think that way""? Tall Dark and Dead definitely does not loose your attention in any way; I believe that's a must with any book. It's also a newer kind of writing for these kinds of books. Most vampire books are very predictable but Tate Hallaway has a refreshing line of new thoughts and ideas. Her characters are very different than what you're used to. It keeps you thinking and changing your mind thousands of time weather you like this person or not. The magic and mystery in this book is fantastic and I would recommend this book to any one into the supernatural."
3,not bad,"This book was okay....didnt really get me hooked. must admit it only became interesting once they got to the ""love scene"". after that it was an okay read. something to past the time. i dont think i'll continue on with the series though"
3,Tall Dark and Dead,"This is the first Garnet Lacey Book I have read and it's probably my last too. This book was just ok. I really liked the character, but she thought and talked more on a high school level than an adult. Kind of irritating."
4,"Tall, Dark & Dead","I enjoyed the book. It was well written and very amusing. I was only confused in a couple of places and had to reread to get the gist of the story. I liked the characters and could easily picture them in my head. Overall, a good purchase."
5,The Inquisition,"I felt this book was an excellent piece of non-fiction literature and offered the best inside information on the inquisition. It contains the most detailed description thus far of any book on its topic. And I strongly urge anyone interested in the inquisition to buy or at least read it. However if you have trouble reading early an 1800's style of writing, like Poe or John Swift, you should try to familiarize yourself with the style before you dive into this work. It has references to multiple books, trials, and dates, so it can easily be a legitimate source for a project or thesis. Or it could just be a gift for an enthusiast. A paperback would be the most logical choice since some of the hardback three book sets can cost up to $. I hope this review will cause you to read this great work."
2,OK-Good,"This is an OK blog. It gives you information, but rarely any new information. It just repeats info from the blog from the past three days. Also, I find it annoying that every time I turn on the wireless, that day's blog just pops up again, even if I have already deleted it."
2,"Interesting, but not enough","Thief of Lives takes place after Dhampir and it's better than the first book. I think they know in this book where they want the character to go, but get bogged down with the characters themselves. The plot is okay and the storyline is interesting.Again I would still say a good starting point for this series is Sister of the Dead."
4,mmmm vampires,"From the authors of Dhampir comes the continuing saga of Magiere the vampire slayer and her companions: Leesil, half-elven and Chap, a dog who is more than he seems. Much to the dismay of the raven haired beauty her dreams of a peaceful life are once again disrupted by a letter from the far off city of Bela. Bela it seems has a problem of the toothy kind.In their quest to find the killers of a councilman's daughter the trio finds that the vampires aren't the only trouble in town. They must also deal with corrupt noblemen and come to terms with past regrets. Once again the mysterious stranger is meddling in Magiere's affairs and steering her to a path which may claim not only her life but her very soul.With a little help from friends old and new Magiere may just make it out of Bela alive but what awaits her after is quite the coin toss."
4,"Details, details...","This is a must-have book for anyone interested in modelling the aircraft of the Luftwaffe's Jadgeschwader 26. Packed with black and white photos of the aircraft and crews in combat and at rest, it provides the details one is looking for when attempting to accurately model a specific aircraft. It contains interesting, if breif, text passages about JG26, along with (24) color profile plates. Chapter 10 is dedicated entirely to textual descriptions of camoflage and markings used by the Gruppe throughout the war. Also of interest are humerous photographs found throughout the book proving that while war is indeed hell, it has it's lighter moments too!"
4,Interesting,"Not a bad book to have for reference if researching the era and pilots of the time, I wish that it went a bit more indepth and showed more then just the ""aces"" of the unit. Over all though, worth the money."
1,The CD hides Charlotte's voice behind the orchestra & choral,"I expected to hear the pure soaring voice of Charlotte Church when I purchased this CD. Instead, if I listen closely I can tell that Charlotte is singing somewhere in the background. Had I been smart enough to know I didn't want the sound track from the video, I might have noticed that there is a DVD version also listed, which probably would have been better listening if you wanted to hear Charlotte singing."
5,BRGARY,I WAS SO GLAD THAT THEY PUT CHARLOTTE'S FIRST CONCERT ON TAPE SO THE WE CAN ALL SEE HER START SHE IS ABOUT 25 YEARS OLD AND AND CAN BE VIEWES ON YOUTUBE.COM WHEN SHE SINGS THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THIS VIDEO IT WILL BRING TEARS TO ANYONE'S EYES IF YOU LIKE CALSSICAL MUSIC EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVECharlotte Church - Voice of an Angel in Concert
5,Amazing!,"Charlotte Church really does have the voice of an angel. I have never heard anyone like her. What is also cute is that her 13 year old personality shines through, too. At the beginning, she brought a couple of stuffed animals out on stage, and a few other times, did not know who the songwriters were. This was part of her cute charm. She is an ordinary 13 year old girl with an extraordinary voice. It is truly a gift from God above."
3,A pretty blend of class and culture...,"'Voice of An Angel' star Charlotte Church has much to learn, but her voice can carry a tune and she sounds very mature for her age. The concert itself was rather tasteful. No slinky outfits, no dancers distracting the audience. No smoke or dramatic screens to show off the young soprano slithering on the dance floor to 'Pie Jesu.' Charlotte has the spark, wit, and personality to pull off the impossible: capturing the audience's full attention with her voice, and performing a wonderful concert presentation. Unfortunately, there are some things I do not like about her voice; it strikes me as nasal at times, like she has a heavy cold. Hopefully, she'll grow out of that...."
5,The Best Teen Singing Voice I Ever Heard Definitely Angelic,Charlotte Church in This Recording will really Touch Your Heart. The music itself on Audio CD or Cassette is Paled Compared with seeing her actually seem to be praying the words out as she sings in concert. This to me is an item that should be in all Classical or Christian Religious Music Lovers homes.
5,The gods must me crazy!,"They would have to be if such a beautiful goddess graced us with her voice and appearance like this girl has! I sat through the DVD and at the end, I was speechless! The whole concert moved me, and it looks so good on DVD. Plus being a Charlotte Church fan, the photo selection was a clever addition and it made the DVD even more enjoyable. If you're thinking of buying any concert on DVD, give Charlotte Church a look. You'll definantly be surprised! See ya!"
2,Terrible sound quality,"'Karate the Art of Empty Hand Fighting' was the first karate book I ever purchased, when I began my training back in 1975. It is one of the best. However, I'd never (yet) had the pleasure of meeting Sensie Nishiyama, so I purchased the DVD set to hear what he had to say.I only wish I could hear what he had to say, but the sound quality is so poor that the traffic outside Sensie's LA dojo was more audible than him. Shame on you Rising Sun, as the picture quality was excellent. I can only assume that they never monitored the sound during the shoot. If they did, the sound director needs firing. A diamond fell into their lap, and they dropped it.I wouldn't purchase another Rising Sun product based on this."
1,Karate: The Art of Empty Hand Fighting,"The second disc in this set is great in it's place. I used to watch this on 16mm film. Even tho the quality has not been re-mastered or edited properly.The first disc is a pathetic use of someone's bad video footage and shows no respect to Nishiyama or his impact on modern Karate.There seems to be an influx of showing truly awful old film footage and classifying it as historical archives.Even tho we live in a digital world, even the packaging and production are truly terrible...one wonders who is really putting these things together.The only truly well-done Video Tapes on Karate seem to be the products of TSUNAMI.Rising Sun, Mastersline and Yamazato productions should be ashamed of themselves.I will never purchase another product from any of them. But I will certainly look at other TSUNAMI product with high expectation."
2,Not what I expected,It's seems to be a personnal documentory of just one master with a hole lot of early film on the 50's japan. Not an instructional dvd at all.
4,Biggest & Baddest Monster Trucks,You know I keep getting these requests for a review but I haven't reviewed the product due to my VCR eating tapes consequently it's broken & I need to get another one before I try the newly purchased tape. I assume the purchase is in top shape. Most everything I've bought through Amazon has been as expected so I have no reason to suspect otherwise here. I just will have to send in an actual review on the product on my time after I get another VCR. Could be a week a month or who knows? It's actually for my little grandson when he comes for his weekend visit with his dad.
5,Funk out! Yasmin,"Funk out! Yasmin is beautiful. I just got her today. Her hair is silky smooth and her lips are dark red. She also has a mole on her cheak. Yasmin comes with:2 pairs of snap on heels (red and white)1 dress1 jacket1 purse1 pair of sunglasses1 pair of caprees1 shirt1 pair of red hoop earings1 Yasmin card1 white star-shaped brushYasmin is fun, cool, and pretty! Her nickname is ""Pretty Princess"" because she is pretty, and she rules! I have 3 bratz and 1 bratz boy. I think that Bratz are better than My Scene or Barbie because they're much more fun to play with, they have cooler clothes and they come with more accessories. Bratz are fun to take on long road trips, play with on a rainy day or play fashion show with. Please buy Yasmin! She's totally worth the money!"
2,oh no,i am upset with this doll because yasmin is my favirote. Her dress looks like a bedspread and her face dosn`t look like the other yasmin dolls.
1,ugly,I HATE ALL YASMINS I HATE THEMBUT THIS YASMIN IS THE DROP SHE HAS THE BIGGEST FOREHEAD I EVER SAW IN MY LIFEIT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS GONNA ATTACK YOU WITH HER HEAD HAHHAHAHAAND WHATS UP WITH HER HAIR ITS NOT RED WHY ARE HER .... RED?ANYWAY I HAVE FIANNA AND MY FRIEND HAS NEVRA AND I THINK THOSE TWO ARE THE BEST OF THE BUNCH FIANNA HAS VERY SOFT AND PRETTY HAIR AND NEVRA HAS PRETTY EYES.DONT BUY THIS UGLY DOLL SHE HAS A HUGE FOREHEAD DONT BUY HER AND SHES EXPENSIVE AND HER CLOTHES LOOK LIKE THEY WERE FROM HER GRANDMOTHER OR SOMETHING NOT WHAT I LIKE BY BY
5,Interstellar Overdrive,"Shaping-space; sound-weaving their clap-tapping vibe, Guta sets the tone for gyro-matic action."
4,Its a great passtime activity,This is the ultamate game for when your waiting around for something and have nothing else better to do. I can beat it in less than 20 minutes but i still play it when 5 minutes feals like the longest 5 minutes of my life.
1,"Vapid, juvenile books","I will admit that I bought all five of the books out of curiosity--I wanted to know what happened to the characters--but I can't claim to have liked them. The characters are wholly unrealistic, the writing style is juvenile, strained, and uninspired, and the plot drags on repetitively. If you want to read a book where the protaganists are all goody-goody gumdrops and the antagonists are pure evil without any reasonable explanation, where the writing sounds like it was written by an seventh grader with a deadline, and where each segment of the story is retold five times (one for each character), then perhaps you will find this book enjoyable. If you actually do have the patience to wade through all that garbage, then I will admit that Sharon Green had a good idea to begin with. It just could have been executed far better."
2,I agree..,With Ms. Leeds I'm afraid. I thought the character development was pretty shallow. Or maybe the characters were just shallow.I gave it 2 stars since it could not have been all bad. I finished it.
2,"OK, BUT....","In 2003 I purchased some non-foldable, standard on the ear Philips headphones from WALMART, for about the same price - the sound/bass volume was superior to these.I thought..well for the price it was'nt bad, well after wearing them on PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - they hardly competed with the bus's noizes. This is even after using a heat gun at low temp, to get them to cover on my ears.These would be OK for big kids, but to me an ADULT, needs something more robust, yes the fold up mech is nice - but in the end if the audio is not up to snuff, it just won't matter.As a point of reference, the older SONY ear clipz sound is better, better still are SENNHEISER PX 100, that also fold - they have FAR SUPERIOR audio/bass/volume quality.I will be giving these away soon.NOTE: Philips can produce some nice headsets, to me this just is'nt one of them."
3,Not for long usage,"I have been using this headphones for 2 weeks. The main problem I see is , I can't use the headphones for long time. It starts to pain near the ears . Otherwise , the sound clarity is decent."
3,"NOT BAD, NOT GOOD","Tried these on a lark as I got them for free...worth what I paid for them. Yes they sound richer than most earbuds...size makes the difference here. But they are hard on the ears (seems my outer ear has gotten tougher since wearing them and used to it, but still hurt a bit), and the volume adjustments need to be cranked up to make the volume strong enough for some types of music. All in all, a bit better than stock earbuds, but not worth it in the end. Save your money."
3,Already lost sound in right ear,"Up until now, I have loved these headphones. They have been comfortable and the sound quality has been good. However, I only bought them about 6 months ago and they have already lost the sound in the right ear. Of course, if I am able to successfully maneuver the cord to the perfect place, then I can get sound out of the right ear. Obviously, not exactly conducive to a pleasant listening experience! It gets old, and I get hand and finger cramps fast!"
3,"Good sound, a couple drawbacks","I bought this set of headphones to replace an older set of Philips SBC HS500 headphones. The older set was a non-folding, behind-the-head design.Compared to the older set, the new headphones are a tighter fit, with more pressure on the ears. The angle of the earpads is more severe than in my older set, contributing to ear pressure.In addition, the headband sits lower on the back of my head than on my older set. It doesn't affect comfort, but the band tends to brush against my shirt collar more often than the older set, which can displace the headphones from my ears, and I can hear the sound of the band brushing against my shirt collar."
1,Not so hot,"I had an older model of Phillips behind-head-folding headphones before (the white ones), they were fantastic and lasted a number of years. Eventually the side which the chord does not come from stopped working. I bought this model because I loved the old ones so much, bu in 2 or less months, these ones had already done the same thing.I've purchased other products (headphones) by Phillips and was always well pleased until I bought these. I don't know if I got a dud pair or if they are all like that."
2,Not comfy,"While the sound is indeed good, I find them not comfortable at all.The speakers are at an odd angle, there's no way to adjust anything, and I'm constantly getting the same pressure point and have to take them off."
2,Problem after 5 months of use,"I was a happy user for 5 months (headphones worked very well for extended walks/runs). Recently, however, I started getting sound dropouts in one ear and now only get sound in one ear. Very disappointing! Giving 2 stars instead of 1 since I got some use out of them, but still..."
3,"Good sound, conveniently compact, but broke within 5 months","I really enjoyed using these on a daily basis -- they were comfortable and sounded good for some music and mostly podcasts without sealing off my ears at work. After 4 or 5 months of folding and wrapping them, one side stopped working, so I'm not sure I'd buy them again, but maybe -- they're not expensive. In the meantime, I'll use some non-folding headphones, as I expect them to be sturdier than these folding ones."
2,Works great... for a while,"The headphones were comfortable and the folding feature was nice. However, the felt covers are not removable (to wash), so sweat buildup happens. Then, after four months of almost daily use, the right speaker suddenly lost about 50% volume. In short, these headphones were not very durable or ideal for those who use them for working out."
2,pinch my ears,"These things have pretty good sound and are inexpensive, but they pinch my ears after I use them for 30 minutes or so. I'm still searching for a replacement for some old Phillips SBC HS386 -- please let me know if you find something good."
3,Good sound quality but uncomfortable after an hour or so,"Good sound quality for the price but after wearing them for an hour or so, the Philips SHS8200 makes my ears hurt. I've had to make accommodations such as listening for 30-45 minutes and then taking a break. I wear hearing aids and this condition is true with or without wearing hearing aids."
4,It's a good deal despite one of its problems,"These headphones have good sound quality, but after a month they did start to slip off a bit too much while I was jogging. There is not really a reliable way to adjust them, but I often I can get them to stop slipping off as much if I press them close to my head. I do wonder how well they will stay on in a few months. Nevertheless, as long as they stay on, they are excellent."
3,Great for travel,"This is a great item for travel, and I love that aspect of the device, however, it is not the best for metro or airline travel. I wanted something that went over the ear, but also great to travel with and this device hit 1 out of 2. Overall, its a good for travel, but sound quality isn't that great."
3,hurts my ears,"overall the headphones sound great, but they really don't fit my head. they barely go over my ears and the plastic bands pull my ears back and out. i wouldn't recommend this product for anyone with a large size head. i wear a size 8 hat. so buyer beware!!"
2,Best neckphones I've found...changed my review,"I think out of the 5 or 6 neckphones I've owned these are my favorite, they sound rich and deep, have a nice clean look, and are comfortable. I once owned a pair of sony's which were comparable but they're no longer made, the newer ones don't sound as good to me.After buying a pair of JVC Flats and cushion earbuds I wouldn't purchase these ever again."
4,Great school snack for kids,My children love Smart Puffs. I love the smaller packages for school lunches.
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I bought this sequel to Starfish, and to be frank, was disap-pointed. Narration seemed disjointed, couldn't follow it verywell-may have been too cyber-punk for my tastes. I ended up skipping to the very end to read the conclusion, and it stilldisappointed me. I don't think I'll keep it, either, that's howdisappointing it was to me. Too many disaparate strings of thestory just did not seem to be resolved in a satisfying way. Toocool and too hip a story for me. Needed better editing, perhapsnot enough resolution to keep me interested very much."
4,good effort,"If you're a Samples fan, this one won't disappoint. ""Pioneer Square,"" ""Going Through Changes,"" ""Sea of Broken Hearts"" some of my favorites already after listening to a promotional copy for a day."
1,Getting worse and worse!,"I'm real sorry folks,I do consider myself a fan and you must go see them as they come your way, but this album is complete trash! These other people must be crazy. The Samples have always run a thin line between awsome and downright cheesy. The lyrics on here are so week vh1 wouldn't play them. I really feel like the band has lost their edge. I can tolerate a mellow turn. All the slow transmissions songs are nice but then most of them were great to begin with. Thier brother songs are on this album and they don't cut it. I would sight some of the lyrics if I could remember but I hardly litsened to it. If you can't go back to the modified police songs that gave you a unique sound please don't be an opening band for hootie and the blowfish. If you know the differnce between hootie and Toad the Wet sprocket then you will understand the differnce between old samples and new."
4,"A kindler, gentler Samples","True, this album is pretty mellow but pretty good none the less. Not killer, but nice mellow tunes to groove to. Worth checking out."
2,A disappointment,"Having seen The Samples in concert soon after moving to Colorado in 1990, I religiously bought every one of their albums as soon as it was released. One or more of them are always on my CD changer in my home, car or office. This album, however, has been disappointing- while some reviewers say the band has ""matured,"" I think they've grown tired. In fact, their lack of energy corresponds with their signing with a major label. None of the songs offers the kind of boost I have been accustomed to."
4,"Excellent, but leaves some to be desired","Excellent, but leaves some to be desired. I will that that this is one of the Samples's best!"
2,not great.. but ok.,"i couldn't read this book all the way through. i read a few of the letters, cause they were interesting. it bothered me that jennifer did not put her letters in the book. i was constantly wondering what she was saying to them, whether she was leading them on or just talking to them about normal things. you get an idea. she talks about her kids her husband her teaching or whatever but there's no flow here."
3,Interesting but felt it had a lot of empty spots,"I did enjoy the book, but I felt it had to may empty spots with no expalnation to them. I was very interested in what the author was wrinting to the men, their responces where hard to understand without knowing what the question was. I did wonder quite a bit about what the author's real motive was in writing to these men. She seem to want to know about gory details of the crimes ( a thrill seeker is what she was called by several of the men), not the motive and reasoning behind it. Also it seemed to me that she supported the men's claims of innocence just to get them to continue writng to her. It was and interesing book however and I would recomend it as a breif insite to the mind of these men that have been convicted as serial killers"
2,A book about nothing,"This book was horrible. Something that is interesting to me is that most books only have one or two line reviews. Everyone seems to write Jennifer full page letters of praise. Who would do this and why? She has no education,no training, and her book has no sociatal value whatsoever. Jennifer, stop writing your own reviews :-)"
2,Not So Great,I found the book rather boring. I thought if she coupled the letters with the letters she sent it would better explain the letters the killers were writing.
2,Not What I Expected,"Although I will give Ms. Jennifer some credit for trying and succeeding in her tasks to publish these letters, I can not understand why she didn't include HER letters as well. The reader was only left to guess at what she could have POSSIBLY written to these inmates.Aside from that, something very vital was missing from the book. Perhaps it could have been the ""lack"" of letters from the MOST notorious inmates that would have been sure to interest the reader. I don't know what it was but I was not that impressed with the book. I would have been most joyous having brought it used for a cheaper price than brand new out of the bookstore.With my being an avid true crime reader, I guess I was expecting a little something more ""raw"" with less whining. Again, Ms Jen... u did a brave and unique thing by going thru whatever u had to go thru to get these inmates to write and correspond with u but your book lacks SOME FORM of substance. U got my money...... so now enjoy spending it."
4,Totally dug this book but what about the auhors letters???,"I've never read a book about serial killers that allowed you to get under the skin of serial killers. It is not easy reading however. Even though there is some of the most incredible descriptions of deviant behavior I have EVER EVER read, there is also a lot of boring material mixed in. But I guess that's what letters often are. These guys didn't know there letters were going to be published in a book. One thing that was bothersome to me is that the author didn't include her letters to the killers and i really wonder why. I would have liked to know what she said to them and the fact that she left them out only makes me believe that maybe she didn't want readers to know what kind of tactics she used. In all, I loved seeing how these guys wrote and the things they said."
1,Don't waste your money!,Jennifer is flooding the review section of her book with positive reviews. Why? The book isn't doing well do to how poorly it reads.
1,Don't bother,"Sorry, but this one gets an ""F."" Jennifer Furio was in over her head when she took this one on. Not only did she not do her homework prior to writing to these people, but she also failed in her correspondence with them to obtain what she ""supposedly"" set out to do. While one or two of these serial killers were somewhat interesting to read, the majority were run of the mill and whined their way through a lot of ink. She failed miserably to ""understand"" what drove them to do what they did. She also didn't bother to include the letters she wrote to them. Not only did this make it somewhat difficult to follow, it left this reader wondering what she was trying to hide."
1,Ugh...so boring!,"I've been reading true crime books for years and am usually fascinated, but this one is just beyond redemption. Couldn't finish it. Pointless and bland."
1,A book by a lonely housewife.,This book is nothing more than a lonely housewife who has nothing better to do than listen to convicted killers say how innocent they are. This book offers nothing new and despite what the author thinks anyone who wants to learn about the true inner workings of serials killers should avoid this book. Books that I highly recommend are The Last Victim by Jason Moss and Mind Hunter by John E. Douglas.
1,Horrid Book - Pass it by,"I've been reading true crime books for over 20 years. There are a bunch of great books out there, and a bunch of horrid books out there. This one, by far, is the worst true crime book I've ever had the displeasure of reading.Furio's commentary is juvenile. The editing, if there was any, leaves much to be desired. And she leaves out the most crucial part of the book -- her own letters to the killers.This book is not a penetrating look into anything other than the bottom of your wallet.Oh and has anyone else noticed that nearly all of the good reviews are written by ""a reader"" and are all written in an identical manner? Appears to me that Furio is trying to toot her own horn to drum up more business for the waste of paper she calls a book."
3,You guys are missing something!,"To those who complain that the author didn't include her own correspondence in the book, I don't think it was because she was dishonest in her letters. She might have been, but the reason she didn't include them, I'd bet anything, is because she's not that talented of a writer. She had a good idea for a book, something that has never been done before, but if she included her own letters, it would have been almost as painful to read as some of the letters we saw from near-illiterate inmates. I bet she wanted to include them, but her editor advised against it. The only true piece of her writing which wasn't cleaned up by her editor is the reprinting of the form letter she used to introduce herself to each convict. This letter clearly demonstrates her lack of eloquence. She uses nickel words and sentences.I agree that any other book of this nature would have been improved by including the letters to which the convicts are responding, but not this one."
1,"get ""the last victim"" instead","not very good, most of it is quite boring.author seems sort of pre-occupied with herself.read ""the last victim"" by jason moss instead,it will make your hair stand on end."
2,"All surface, no substance","Ms. Furio wrote to serial killers solicting letters for a book and this is the woeful result. While some of the letters do bring out some provocative points, Ms. Furio fails to provide any substantive context. Her not including any of her own letters make her techniques suspicious."
2,Excellent book to even out a wobbly table.,"...There is very little of interest in this book. One gets the impresson that Ms. Furio sent the same ""opening letter"" to masses of multiple killers and published anyone who responded more than 3 or 4 times. The book is poorly written, horribly edited, and worse - not even entertainingly voyeuristic.Almost all of the serial killers in the book claim their innocence and want financial help in funding their appeal. The only story of any interest was from David Gore of Florida. However, his letters were so disgusting that I questioned the need to even put them into print. I wondered about the families that had to read his vivid recollections of his crimes.I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a book to lull them into sleep, to throw at howling alley cats in heat, or to smash cockroaches. If you want a book to read and entertain you for any period of time - pass on this one.--Kathryn White-Fidram"
1,Save your money!,"I read all of the other reviews here and bought the book thinking it would be great, but IT WAS HORRIBLE!I thought it would be the criminals telling their side of the story regarding the crimes they were accused of committing, but I was disapointed to find that the book was actually just convicted criminals writing (mostly) about life in jail and their hobbies. I read the book waiting for an exciting part, and it never happened. Just a bunch of convicts writing letters to the auther saying how they hate the police and how they spend their day reading, writing, or watching TV. Save your money and spare yourself the agony: don't buy this book!"
2,Caters to purient interests,"Furio has done no ""writing"" in this book. She merely has collected responses to her letters (which she does not print). In that Furio fails to provide any background for the reader in psychopathology (and she has none), the average person will have no idea of the veracity of any of what the killers have written. They will be used by the killers for their own purposes and think they have learned something. For profiling students, the book has someting to offer. IF the student has a good background in psychopathology, then, he/she may study the various methodologies and attitudes these criminals present and this could be useful in the identification and investigation of suspects in sexual homicide cases. Pat Brown, Director/Criminal Profiler/The Sexual Homicide Exchange of Washington DC and Vicinity"
4,It's so dang cute!,"I really liked this book because not only did it give a short history lesson behind traditional wedding etiquette, it also showed us some very different and unusual styles of cakes. I liked the quilt-design cake but others I showed it to thought it was tacky. Needless to say it's an interesting design. This little pocket book will come in handy, I'm sure, when it is my turn to take my final stroll as a single woman. But who knows when that will be. . .I'm still 20!"
2,Wedding,"Didn't have anything useful for me from this book. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone else for that matter, Didn't need it"
5,A different view....,"This is the second book in Zahn's Conquerors trilogy. But it is written a completely different way to what I expected. The first book was written from our (the Humans) point of view, but this book gives us the Aliens (the Zhirrzh) point of view. There are one or two complete twists to the story and after reading this book I just had to go and get the third and final book..."
2,Bad folowup to book 1,"After Zahn's great start to this series, the middle book suffers from the usual ""middle book"" syndrome of trilogies. It's not awful, but it just doesn't live up to the previous book. The aliens all talk like they just escaped from a bad melodrama compared to the sparkling dialogue of the humans in the first novel. Also Zahn makes a few goofs hither and yon, and showed that he didn't do a whole lot of research. For example, an alien drug that he made up for this book he gives the name ""premarin"" which had me laughing out loud. (Premarin is an estrogen replacement drug currently on the market.) Soooo, male aliens suffer from menopause? This book was so lukewarm that I doubt I'll even bother with the third novel in the series."
4,For those who are 20 and 30 something.,"Even though I don't fall into the age category of the title of my review, I enjoyed reading The Enchanters vs. Sprawlburg Springs. The characters were original. The storyline was intriguing. The climax to the story took a twist that I had not expected. I'm hoping for a sequel."
4,ECCO Loafer,Comfortable even though heel is slightly higher than other ECCO shoes. Did not care for the color so had it polished to cordovan.
4,Facinating premise,Very interesting premise with characters you can relate to. A good story in itself but leaves you wanting more.
3,Disapointing,"I'd have to say that this book did not meet my expectations. I found the writing to be unweildy and difficult to follow at times, and the the characters and plot just aren't as engaging as we've come to expect from Lee & Miller.This isn't a BAD book, by any means. It simply doesn't measure up to the previous Liaden universe works."
1,Really Disappointed,"Mostly a rehash of Crystal Soldier. Very little, if any, new content. I usually love the Miller and Lee books, but this is an exception. Not up to the standard that I expect from them. If you have Crystal Soldier don't waste your money on this one."
1,i agree with p b garrott,"there are some good things in here, but few and undeveloped. i did enjoy the academic promotion method, but that was about the only part i enjoyed and it went on forever. i finally skipped to the end.being a designer, i realize that the creative process doesn't operate by demand, but i would rather learn more about our heroes after they and the Tree left liad than read backstory.now, the authors are apparently starting a new series, but i'm not at all sure i will read it, partly because this book was such a major disappointment and partly because i don't want to support their current direction.give us back miri and the turtles and shan and the rest."
4,a delightfully solid second in series,"I have been a fan of the clan Korval and Liad for years! Of course a reader wants a ""series"" (because each novel can stand alone) to go on and on but I was ready for backstory on beginnings! Crystal Soldier is a very good read but I thought Crystal Dragon could stand alone very well. The characters are solidly drawn and ideas from the other novels are seamlessly woven into this volume. I was very curious about how the dramliza developed and loved seeing how the original population of Liad came there! There are many threads to weave together in this story - how else can a whole world be drawn? - but the weaving is colorful and inventive! I am very satisfied with Crystal Dragon and enjoy my rereadings a lot!Oh, an aside - anyone who has worked in academia will be tickled at the scholars and their methods of academic progression! We've all worked there!"
3,Trying to do too much in too short a story,"First let me say that I'm a big fan of the Liaden novels, however I felt that this book was really trying to do too much in too short a space. The philosophical/metaphysical issues involving Rool Tiazon and his lady were interesting, but not really developed. One was left wondering how she came to agree with him about the Edonai, and if she ever really believed they had an equal partnership. The scenes with Lute and Lady Moonhawk were odd - even having read all the chapbooks, I really didn't understand how they fit into this book, how they came to oppose the Edonai, or what their plan/goal _was_. Finally with all the time spent on these other story lines I felt that the Jela-Cantra (and to some extant Tor An) story lines were not as fleshed out as I would like. One never learns why Cantra's line was terminated or much more about her odd history then was revealed in Crystal Soldier."
1,Disappointed,"I had such high hopes after reading reviews of Strixaderm. I used it on my chest religiously, 3 times a day, until I ran out and never saw any improvement in my stretch marks. Absolutely no change whatsoever. I guess it works for some and not for others. I am glad that I tried it though, now I know...would have always wondered if it would have worked."
4,amazing amount of information in a single guide,"Any serious Disney collector must own one of these, this guide is very knowledgeable and includes many very rare examples of early Disneyana. The color pictures are clear and beautiful."
4,A Sincere Novel,"My Brother suggested that I read this book and although I usually disagree with my brother I agreed with him on this. This book is better than most out. Once we get introduced to the characters we really want to know what comes next. And unlike most novels that have a kind generic structure, this novel breaks all expectations. I really suggest this novel."
1,Pretentious,"This was the most pretentious book I've ever read half way through. In the end this story is about an immoral character who we cannot like. A story that makes you want to kill yourself. And a theme that no one except the insane could possible relate to. I don't know why I wasted my time reading this, and I urge you not to read it either."
4,Very Pleasant,"This is the first yoga DVD I've ever purchased so I am no expert by far. As a scrub nurse, I do know that after standing on my feet for 12 hours in the operating room, this routine loosens up all of my stiff and tense muscles, and restores my mood. As a beginner, I found this DVD to be ""just right"" -- not too difficult, but fun and entertaining."
2,nice try,"I was introduced to kundalini by Ravi Singh and Anna Brett. This video didn't impress me very much. There are no chapters and my dvd player couldn't even bring up a time remain clock. There is no lower body work. I found the backround music unimpressive and after a while I found myself wanting to turn off the music. There are five girls, all attractive (in their 20's) wearing what appears to be costumes with wierd pants split at the sides and tank tops. Four of the girls never speak. The main instructor talks while exercising and I think the voice over is better for the student, like me. This video was relatively expensive and not as complete as other videos I have in my library. I prefer Ravi and Anna or Gurutej Kaur and perhaps even Carol Carlson when it comes to kundalini yoga workouts."
2,disapointed,"I have been a practitioner of Kundalini yoga on and off for a number of years. I recently decided I would get back into it and decided to borrow a dvd from a friend. He lent me this Mantra Girl DVD and I must say I was pretty disapointed. I noticed that the form exhibited was not particularly good, maybe it is because the Mantra Girl has not been at this as long as some of the more well known practioners of the style both male and female. I would suggest that for any new dvd's that Mantra Girl might be contemplating that she add more substance and strict observance to form and less hollywood like fluff."
3,"A great challenge, but some downfalls","This is a beautiful practice, with beautiful people (and their outfits) and beautiful music, but I have to say when I first played the DVD it seemed to be geared for male viewing. Rubbing hands vigorously and then showing close-ups of women with large chests didn't impress me as serious Kundalini Yoga. I was disappointed that the DVD does not include menus (it just runs from beginning to end like a VHS tape). Also, the voice seems to be dubbed in. If you can put all that aside, it is a very challenging Kundalini practice and well instructed.(Although I would not consider it for beginners. I would recommend Ravi Singh's DVDs for beginners.) The best part is Erin's music on the DVD -- it is wonderful and enlightening! She has a music CD available which I'm sure would be well worth the money.Please see my other recommendation for Yoga and Meditation DVDs on Amazon and thanks for reading!"
4,Ups and downs,"I bought this product so that I can play my 360 online. From what I've experienced so far it works good enough - though not as good as going with a direct connection.Playing co-op works really well, I haven't done much versus, but it seems to be a little slower than a direct connection.Downloads take forever though... something that takes maybe 1 min to download with a direct connection took 5-10 min with this product."
1,Data speed slower than I thought,"These are EXTREMELY nice to have not only for a console, but if you want link an extra computer to the internet/home network. Very simple to setup, no software or drivers, just plug it in and set it up as if it were a regular ethernet (CAT5) cable. However, don't expect a lot of speed out of these, I was getting 300K max out of them. Fine for online games, but not too great for downloadable content."
5,Great wireless solution,Works perfectly with my 360 and pc. I can't believe you can transfer internet data over RF! So weird but works well with good distances.
1,Product as stated,just as ad stated. this will do the job. Fare price would recommend.this product to anyone that uses auger bitt.
3,Cute but they run small,"I normally wear a size 8 in shoes, especially heels. So I got these in a size 8. Well they fit like they are a size 7. My feet aren't exactly narrow, but I rarely, rarely ever wear a size 9. But I now have to return these shoes so I can get a 9. I really hope the 9's fit because I absolutely love this shoe! They are gorgeous! The quality seems good (even though I haven't worn them yet), but when I got them they looked like they had been wet before or when they dyed them it dyed unevenly or something (I got the red ones), but you can tell they haven't been worn, so I'm not sure what that's about, but I'm sure it has something to do with the seller and not the actual shoe itself. So hopefully the size 9 will fit me so I can review on the actual comfort of the shoe!"
2,Very cute but extremly uncomfortable,These shoes look great but the heel is much higher than it looks! Extremely uncomfortable to wear. I wear heels all the time so I'm used to high heels but these- I only had them on for 5 minutes walking around my house and I couldn't stand it anymore- so I had to return them. A shame since they are so cute.
3,Hmmm,"I don't think a book is going to help anyone in this department. I'm now convinced that its all about the relationship you have and how that person makes you feel. If you find the right person you will forget about problems you ""think"" you have. Turn on some music and enjoy!"
4,A beautifully illustrated book on little known history,"This book is beautifully illustrated and deals with a little known incident in American history. I think it's great! I bought a copy for my niece and soon I'm going to have to buy one for myself! If you want children to understand that there's much more to history than the ""safe"" version they've been fed in school this book is great!"
5,Another 24-bit Digitally Remastered double CD.,"Two other Ash Ra Tempel CDs return with new 24-bit Digitally Remastered versions on one double CD, enhancing the beauty of these timeless recordings."
5,The Best For Natural Sleep Aid,I hope they don't change the formula because 'calms' and 'night-forte' taste terrible...seems like a company has a good product and they stop making it to make something worse.If I use it too many nights in a row I get a headache.It works really well though I usually take 2 or three and I fall asleep naturally...no sudden coma or anything.I stocked up because I tried the other Hyland sleep pills and they taste so bad I can't use them.
5,christmas gift,the stone resin doberman made the wife very happy.The dog was better than expected and the shipment was fast.thank you for the great attention my small order received.
1,"Another ""shining"" example of British ""cuisine""","Really just horrible recipes. Being a glutton for punishment, I wrote off the first two failures. The third was just so horrible I had to throw away the book for fear of inflicting its contents on someone else."
1,So what?,"So what? Mother Teresa was a ""traditional"" Catholic. There are traditional Catholics and nontraditional Catholics. What is the point?It seems that Hitchins has a problem with the fact that a so called ""traditional"" Catholic is so revered around that world that he feels the need to debunk her image. Has it worked? I doubt so, as millions still admire her service to the weak and poor - yes even many of us who did not agree with all her conclusions, actions, and thoughts.I learned a long time ago that just because someone reaches different conclusions from me does not make that person evil, or bring into question their motivations. Maybe Hitchins too will grow up one day."
1,Sorry Chris,"As soon as I see Christopher Hitchins picking maggots of a dying human being I'll give some credibility to this excessively mean spirited excuse for a book. Like all of us, except for Jesus, Mother Teresa was a flawed human being - yes a sinner. Unlike many of us, however, she worked for those most like to ignore. Hitchins may fancy himself a ""progressive,"" but it is interesting that he spends his time writing books like these instead of serving the ""least among us,"" - the very people ""progressive"" like Hitchins once claimed to represent."
3,A 4-Page Article Crammed Into a 98-Page Book,"Somebody had to say it -- Mother Teresa was an egotist of limited intelligence who cared little for the material welfare of her charges and sucked up to the rich and powerful. The problem is that Hitchens does not say it particularly simply or well.This is curious, since he wrote another book,Why Orwell Matterswhich is a paean to that writer's spare writing style. Unfortunately, Mr. Hitchens seems unable to follow Orwell's example."
2,Not what it claims to be,"Mr. Hitchens is guilty of intellectual dishonesty, muddle-headedness, or some degree of both in the way he frames his attack on the figure of Mother Theresa. By and large what he says is true, but what it amounts to is not so much an indictment of Mother Theresa as an attack on the religion she represented, one that holds, for instance, that salvation is more important than health or confort, that suffering may be a way to greater holiness, and that abortion is a grievous sin. I understand how someone like Mr. Hitchens might disagree with these views (indeed, I am an atheist and disagree with them too), but the book amounts to the shocking revelation that Mother Theresa was (gasp!) a traditional Catholic."
2,"Getting a little desperate, isn't he?","Hitchens cute carpetbagger scholarly style in this book outweighs the small impression it might otherwise have made. He reminds us once again that he is still one of the chief apologists for the political division of the school of resentment, the post-post-modernist informed, new bureaucratic academic conformist's solution to Noam Chomsky. It's funny how this book is really not about Mother Theresa's fallability, but about Hitchens' intended audience; this is merely entertainment for self-styled intellectuals who like to make space for their own mediocrity and inaction by destroying others reputations. Even if Mother Theresa were to truly be a saint, if there is such a thing, it wouldn't have changed anything Hitchens had to say."
1,Read it and venture into the darkness.,"There are those, minions of darkness, for whom light of any kind, or size, or amount is deemed a dire threat. Hence they are driven to extinguish it whenever and wherever they find it lest even its merest luminescence expose and destroy them. In their witless frenzy no weapon is off limits. Thus even a diminutive nun living a Spartan life helping the poor, the sick and terminal is deluged with the sludge of spurious recrimination for being a shill and the tool of propagandists. It will ever be so with lights that shine in the darkness. Mother Theresa stands in a long line of living lights among whom are Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus Christ. The sad truth is that their last state will be worse than their first because with each light they extinguish they bring themselves ever closer to that which they fear most. I give it no stars since light is any form is inimical to them."
4,Bitter-Sweet,"I have been reading Hitchens' books quite avidly in the last half of the year, and this book landed in my hands after finishing the superbGod Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.I should confess I felt a little dirty as the pages started to turn. Despite my enjoyment of Hitchen's prose, this book left a bit of an aftertaste in my mouth, a disappointment similar to finding out that Santa does not exist.But as terse and poignant it may read this book is not a bitter ad hominem attack on the person of Mother Theresa. It is rather a criticism on the ways that she, other people and even institutions have benefited from the artificial creation of her over-inflated saintly myth and the political/monetary advantages it procured.The book sometimes reads a bit dry, but the information, quotations, official letters included made it worth my while. And at 98 pages, it is not too long a while."
3,"""Missionary Position..."" does not ""straddle"" the facts and is quarrelsome in tone.","The portrait or montage presented to the reader appears to have been based on ""reverse engineering"" of the facts to support a preconceived conclusion. I agree with the saying, ""Let the truth be told and the truth will make you free."" Furthermore, sometimes it is better to make an observation with a wink and a nod rather than a snarl and a shout."
1,No telling,"I'm not sure what has made the authour such a bitter hate filled person, but perhpas if he spent more time working on actual problem solving rather then whining about people with whom he disagrees he might be happier."
1,"Shame, Shame on You!","The title of this book basically says it all! How could you stoop so low? Shame, shame on you Christopher Hitchens! Maybe royalties and fame are what drives you -- sensationalism at it's finest.Mother Theresa was a selfless, giving individual who had little regard for herself and did work which only could have been inspired by God Himself.Uninspired trash!"
1,"For atheism, see Nietzsche. For cynicism, see Hume.","Hitchens continues his weak arguments and fallacious logic in this work. Any well-read individual (and I'm not referring to the ""I've read 20 Steven King books crowd)can't help but be astonished at the popularity of this trivial book. There are no footnotes, there are no citations - nothing to indicate this text has any scholarly merit. His logic is often weak enough to be turned on itself, and his characterizations of ideas and events reek of ""angsty-13-year-old-with-agenda"" rather than any real objectivity. For my money, it's about as good as the pulp fiction that currently rots the brains of the masses. This, along with ""God is not Great,"" is ""Twilight"" for the casual atheist, and for anyone who REALLY wishes to question or doubt, works such as this pose problems in their simplicity and stand as a setback to legitimate secular thinking."
2,Just more anti-religion loathsome propaganda,"There truly is no limit to the hatred of some. Attacking a person who dedicated her entire life to helping others truly illustrates how dedicated these individuals are to uprooting the values on which American society have stood for hundreds of years. Not to mention that such individuals and their groups will stop at nothing attack all that is good. It is ironic that people who have done nothing more in their lives than read a simple book and write a critique criticize and even condemn a literal saint who dedicated her entire life to helping others. To those of you who wrote the ""book reviews"" viciously attacking Mother Theresa: what have you done with your life?And one more thing: when you write a ""review,"" try actually reviewing the book, and leave your propaganda at home."
1,Forgets to properly connect all the dots,"You cann be an atheist, and you can hate the Catholic Church, but it is hard to deny that Mother Teresa on balance did far more good for the world than she did evil and I'd imagine far more good than most of us. Hutchinson seems to imply that she received millions of dollars in aid and yet she didn't provide a high level of aid to the poor of Calcutta. Thi simplies that she was living the high life in luxury - nothing could be further than the truth read her journals for a clear picture of teh kind of life she leads.Go ahead and hate god, that's your choice and you'll be held to account, but on the facts admit the Mother Teresa was a saintly woman."
2,Next one up is Jesus,"Hitchens is no doubt an entertaining writer. Not always thorough, but clever. His attack on Mother Teresa for her associations with dictators and others of ill repute reminds one of the criticism that Christ is reported to have endured for eating with prostitutes and tax collectors. One can only imagine Hitchens take on the life of Christ, who reportedly came to save sinners and not the just, who had no need of salvation."
1,Hitchens finally did it!!,"Christopher Hitchens finally bought his one-way ticket to Hell with this one! Anyone that thinks this book is ""fair and balanced"" should read one that balances this bunk, and then make an informed judgment. For instance, read Susan Conroy's wonderful ""Mother Teresa's Lessons of Love and Secrets of Sanctity."""
4,Hitchens with an attitude,"As always, Hitchens shows us who's the boss. And he's doing us all a favour - in a world where everybody just seems to adore and almost worship this little misguided Albanian woman. Teresa is a worldclass hypocrite and scam artist. Do yourself a favour and read this little book -"
2,Hitchens Fan Disappointed,"You look up ""iconoclast"" in the dictionary and are likely to find a sneering photo of Hitchens. I bought this book after seeing him on television a number of times and admiring his ""take no prisoners"" rhetorical style. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. For starters, the book is less than one hundred pages, in large print. Not the end of the world but the cover price on my paperback edition is $17.95. I paid less through Amazon, but really? Eighteen dollars for under a hundred pages? Finances aside, the book's contents are weak. Do not get me wrong: I respect Hitchens's willingness to take on the sacred, and I also agree with a number of his conclusions. But the superficial nature of his arguments is infuriating, even more so because Hitchens is obviously brilliant and the effort seems lazy. Not recommended unless you are a traditional Catholic who is patient, bored, or angry enough to take on Hitchens's diatribe in a serious manner."
4,"great read, thorough;y researched",i very much enjoy the writings of christopher hitchens and it is no different with this book. he presents a great argument and reminds us that those whom we worship must also be held acceptable
4,"Interesting facts, difficult language","Interesting facts indeed, though the language was quite difficult for a foreign reader (Swede). I found myself looking up 1-2 words per page, which quite slowed down the reading process."
3,thought provoking,"In Missionary Position, Hitchens really challenges what is presented to us as ""saintly"" role models by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and society in general."
4,Mother T. Revisited,"This little book provides an ""alternate view"" of the life and work of Mother Teresa. The balance it provides should be shared widely among her strongest fans as part of ""setting the records (factual)"" straight... that is, if one can remain objective in forming a new position with regards to her life long effort to support fundamentalist, Catholic views.An easy read!"
3,Bound to Enrage and/or Enlighten,"Like Hitchens' other books, this one is a feat of intellectual integration, coming at the topic from a direction few might think to take. It has probably set a lot of blood to boiling. Not being one of the ""Teresa cult,"" and taking a jaundiced view of her flaunting of ""humility,"" I found it enlightening, though sad. One does want to believe that it is the poor, and not their ""helpers'"" self-promoting sanctity, to which one is contributing. To find that the former are admittedly a mere vehicle for the latter is depressing--as is the information that it is not the orders' poverty that deprives its ""beneficiaries"" of antibiotics or relief from pain."
4,I never want Hitchens to write my biography,"Hitchens rightly undresses the soon to be saint with story after story that exposes her hypocrisy concerning money, politics and religious conviction. I especially love the story about Charles Keating and Mother Teresa's letter of appeal on his behalf. If there is a God, Mother Teresa had some splainin to do when she met St. Peter. At under 100 pages this book will be done in a day but I think it will put a smile on your face."
1,A disgusting book by a disgusting person.,"Christopher Hitchens is famous for not only disbelieving in God, but apparently being obsessed in hating a God he doesn't believe in. This book was obviously vomited out in order to try and tarnish the reputation of the saintly Mother Teresa who spent most of her life helping others. It is pompously written in an elitist, pseudo-intellectual, double talk style. I can, certainly, understand why Hitchens, who appears not to have done much in his life except to spew hatred towards popular religious figures, would have so much antipathy for someone like that. I suggest people read Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography or Something Beautiful for God if one really wants to read about the life and works of Mother Teresa. However, if the whole reason that you'd read this book is because you hate Christianity, the Catholic Church, members or religious orders, and people who help others, then this book is for you!"
1,......,"Find a woman who is as old as the venerable Mother Theresa, and look through the long life. If you'd like to find evidence of wrongdoing, certainly something this woman has done may qualify. Is she a greedy Catholic whose only desire is Sainthood? You must be kidding! Everyone one makes mistakes, but on God's scales, her's is nearly vertical."
4,gr8 positions,"Intersting book. Makes you wonder how many lies that eventhough they are too impressive to be true, we still believe on, just because of the flow other's comments.Common sense is the least common of the senses."
3,"not such a good book, not such a good woman. short and to the point.","this is not a very good book. its extremely short. it can be read in about 1 hr., however, the story that it tells is amazing. this woman was a terrible human being. if you can get this book for cheap, get it."
3,Very poorly done,"Frankly, I expected more from Hitchens... The central ideas behind this book seem to be that: a) Mother Theresa was less concerned with actually caring about the sick and the poor than she was about propagandizing for Holy Mother church; and that b), in accruing vast wealth while ostensibly living in poverty, her organization (clothed as it is in the inviolate respectability of religion) got away with conduct for which secular organizations and persons would have been called to account. Sadly, these theses ere never properly developed. This book (really a long pamphlet at only 90 pages) is exceptionally badly organized and ends up being little more than a haphazard diatribe. It could have been an interesting expose of an important issue but the author has instead just tossed off a quick and dirty pay-copy. I was not impressed."
2,Good points - bad book,"While Hitchens raises some valid points in this brief tract, they are badly served by the intensely vituperative, partisan and anti-religious language that he uses. This is unfortunate, because it undermines the credibility of his arguments.I do agree, however, that Mother Teresa has (or had) some explaining to do regarding her interaction with brutal dictators in Albania and Haiti, her intervention in the Keating Five case, her organizations inability to properly account for donated funds, and her apparent indifference to alleviating poverty.Good points - bad book."
1,Boring!,I have not read an Inspector Maugret Mystery before and I probably won't read another. It waa slow at the start amd the ending improbable.
4,Another mystery solved,Excellent read on a cold winter night -- the next best thing to being in Paris! Order me café creme and a croissant!
5,Must have for any Southern Hip Hop Fan,If you appreciate Southern Hip Hop...this doc covers pretty much the bases. Production is well done and the topics and artists they touch are wide and varied.
5,Hotness for real,"i began listening to music from the south in the mid nintees and this music has eveolved into what we hear today this was a great dvd what was missing though to me was outkast they have been missing from most music dvd's ryhme and reason, the show etc and this is a damn shame that is the only draw back to this set other than that it is a great overview of the musical movement going on in the south at the present time."
2,Size is small,"I have a large head, but when I tried to strap the velcro around my face the two ends did not meet. I tried to give it to my wife who is size 4 dress and 120 pounds, it barely fit her.The only thing to adjust is the velcro that is sewn into the width, so 23 inches is the full length.Subtract three inch of overlap so you can velcro the two ends together and now you have 20 inches of usable length."
2,Not a correct Description,"I haven't used the tool yet, but a couple of problems with it out of the package... #1 this is not a screw point auger type bit that is described, at least the one I recieved has a chisel type point on it. I plan to use it in a drill press, so it will likely work OK, but this would be tough to use in a hand drill like a lot would want to use it for. #2 the picture shows 3 inserts, which must be for a larger model capable of even larger diameters, the wording is accurate in the hole sizes listed, but it was a surprise that there are only 2 cutter inserts. The generic picture also shows a screw point, not the chisel point that's on the real tool. I expect it to work OK, but if not I'll comment more. Amazon should tighen up the details of the listing for this."
2,Not What is Advertised,"Don't be fooled by the poorly worded description, this bit does NOT include the attachment for drilling holes between 3"" and 5"" in Diameter. It only works from 7/8"" to 3"". Since I need a 4.75"" hole it doesn't really do me any good!"
3,Not As Good As It Should Be,"The set screw that must be loosened in order to adjust the cutting width was in so tight that I could not loosen it. I ended up having to take it to the local hardware store where they had to use a wrench to undo it. Also, the arm that moves back and forth to set the hole width does not slide smoothly, making it very difficult to adjust precisely."
2,Marginal results,I was disappointed that it made the circle just fine but then it was not very effect in drilling the hole very deep. The center hole was OK but the in between just didn't drill out very good at all?
3,"Same-0, same-0",Love MonsterQuest but don't plan on buying this since the four episodes are repeats from the previous MonsterQuest series - for what they are asking for this buy an entire season and get about ten stories!
3,Repeats,"This compilation of shows from MonsterQuest series. The MonsterQuest crew examine the evidence supporting the existence of four ""monsters"" featured in movies and literature. The segments are amusing, somewhat informative, and disturbing at times, but ultimately the evidence for the existence of the monsters examined is inconclusive. If you already own a library MonsterQuest DVDs you probably have these segments."
2,Not appropriate for small children,"I'm sorry I didn't see the review from ""A reader from USA , August 9, 1998"", but I agree with the assessment. I purchased this book to read to my 5 year old daughter. I began to read a couple aloud, but found I needed to seriously edit them, or stop reading entirely. Now, I preview each story before I begin - and I find I'm skipping most of them. For example, the first story I selected told the disturbing tale of a bird that helps an abandoned dog find food and rest only to watch him get run over and killed. The bird then seeks revenge on the driver and succeeds in having him killed."
1,NOT appropriate for small children,The stories in this book are written for an older age group. They are hard for a small child to understand and/or graphically violent.
2,365 Bedtime Stories,"Several people have commented on the content of many stories not being suitable for small children, and I agree with that. Some of the stories are wonderful, some are gruesome, and some are dull. Overall I do not recommend this book. Additionally, the stories are of an inconsistent length making it difficult as ""bedtime"" reading book. Some are long, and some are less than a paragraph. This can be frustrating for both the child and the parent. Then there are the ""variations"" which are included as a story for the day but normally are not stories. They simply tell how the tale differs in different areas. To be blunt these variations are exceedingly boring."
3,OK stroy book for kids.,Our son loves a story ever night & the 365 Disney storybook has been read for 2 years so we got this book. Some of the stories are not kid friendly so you have to proff read before reading it aloud but sure like that most of the stories have a moral to them.
3,Interesting,This isnt exactly what I thought it was but my son likes it. The stories are very short and I have to read more than a few but as long as he enjoys it.
5,Great book for the beginning reader.,This book is a charming way to spend a quality moment with your young child every day for a year. Where else will you find something that gives you the chance to spend a magical moment with a child EVERY DAY?
3,To Informative,"I had to read this book for an assignment and I found that the book was a little to into detail. The last half of the book is a glossary of people that Tycho was aquainted with. The writing is good, but this book is only for people writing their dissertation on Tycho's life."
4,POLITICALLY ACTIVE FRIENDS,"Truly satisfying work is sometimes centered in old methods, values and attitudes. Recipes laced with a gentlewoman's confidence."
5,"Fantastic display of photography, information, and recipes","This is exactly the kind of book i was looking for. Something that would give me examples of regional Colombian cooking, along with info and great photography of the people and country side. So far, i've only tried a few recipes, but I know that my guests are eager for more spanish cooking soon! It's a beautiful book, that I hope will be passed down to my children and their children one day."
5,It has the best Colombian cooking recipes.beautiful pictures,The book has the famous Colombian recipes with great pictures and it makes a review of all different regions.
2,Not enough Kim D,"I bought this dvd towatch Kim Dawson, myfavorite B-movie Queen, and she had only one scene. I'vealways thought she has the talent and the looks (that all natural smoking hot body) to make it big time but never got her break."
3,"not bad, good acting","I found the movie somewhat over the top, as expected of any low-budget sci-fi. But the young actor Danny Hill I thought to be quit amazing in his role. He definately deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the small success of this film. He has a potential future in acting."
4,Excellent companion book,"I also use the Mosby pocket guide to cultural health assessment by D'Avanzo, but this book is a must for those cultures found most often in the US. It includes American Indian, Japanese American, Chinese American, etc. It was last edited in 1996 but the information seems to be current. The spiral binding makes it much easier to use also."
4,great guide,I found this useful for my cultural nursing class and used it often with papers and presentations.
4,Must Read Material For The Zep Fan,"The first couple hundred pages deserve a full 5 stars. This book has more first hand interviews and accounts, not only by the band but also by people who knew and were around the band, than any other. It is a gold mine of insight into the beginnings and first years of Led Zeppelin. My only problem is that the author is clearly biased toward showing the ""good"" side of a band that had it's share of ""dark"" sides. He writes, at times, like he wants to make sure he stays in good graces with the ""boys"" rather than tell it like it is... Otherwise, get yourself a copy and enjoy! I gaurantee you will learn something new, even if you've already read 5 other Zep bios!"
2,"Great concept, bad execution.","I am currently looking for my next dog and came across this book at the library. The idea sounded promising but I was very disappointed. There are too many checklists and questions without real guidance (a questionnaire at the end of each chapter would have been better) and they are alternating with more examples than I care to know of how the sample humans deal with their dog situation. I started skipping from chapter to chapter, hoping to find some real revelations somewhere especially since each chapter sounded promising but in the end I was utterly confused and certainly did not gain any new insights. I give the book two stars for the idea that is behind its contents, but the execution is poor."
5,Tough subject!,Have a PhD in math but now I'm ready to sign up for physics 100. Lets see if I pass?!
3,Lightweight or flimsy - take your pick,"Very lightweight, and also very flimsy. It hasn't broken, but definitely I wouldn't put more than a few items on it. Not particularly steady but as long as you have a flat surface to stand it on, it won't turn over."
3,"Like, Vibes, Man","Of the two albums presented here SCHWINGUNGEN (it means ""vibrations"" or ""oscillations"" if anyone asks) gets the slight nod. The band's first album (ASH RA TEMPEL) was better, probably because it was all instrumental and with only two (very) long tracks. SCHWINGUNGEN tries for being more visceral- -vocals and more structure, you see- -but falls flat as their lack is what made ASH RA TEMPEL so great. It does have its moments, though. Had I been there, and I'm glad I wasn't, I would have said ""better luck next time."" Unfortunately the next time happened to be SEVEN-UP, about which the less said the better. If they were gonna let T Leary preside over the live bit (tres hippy-chic!) then they should have told him to just sit down, fer cryin' out loud, and keep his trap shut. It doesn't work, even as comedy- -and they were dead serious. Come to think of it, maybe they were having a little joke on the good Doctor at the audience's expense. Either way it's laughable."
5,Beautiful book inside and out from Amazon,not the inspector but world war 1 on the home front and real and gritty and full of mystery..if you can stop comparing to the Rutledge series..it will be a good read. id love a series with this backround..these charaters to.
3,A disappointing stand alone novel from the Todds,"I'm an avid fan of the Ian Rutledge stories and have high hopes for the new Bess Crawford series which has an excellant start with A DUTY TO THE DEAD. However, THE MURDER STONE lacks the keen observations and sharp characterization I have come to expect from this mother/son writing team. Truth is that I wondered if we were even supposed to like the protagonist. The ending was probably meant to be a shock to the reader, but it just wasn't consistent. So what we have is a book which is a pleasant enough read, but not up to the author's usual standard."
2,So close but no cigar,"After enjoying a couple of Todd's Inspector Rutledge books I was quite looking forward to the potential this book offered but felt hugely let down instead. Whilst the book seems to answer the questions and mysteries that arise in this story, it really doesn't feel like it. I had to go back a couple of times to the ending to make sure I hadn't missed something. I think Todd missed a huge opportunity for a real potboiler of a murder mystery here and just ran out of ideas or lost interest in his own story at the end."
1,Don't bother,"I am an avid reader of these kind of books, and am usually very willing to make allowances for varying degrees of writing skill. Having said that, I found this book tedious and poorly written with pages of mind-numbingly vacuous dialogue, a meandering knee-jerk plot, and a preposterous ending.I pride myself on finishing every book I start, and I did with this one, but it was like pulling teeth. By the time I got to the last five pages, I was just ready for it to be over.If you like good mysteries, good World War I historical novels, or good thrillers, do yourself a favor - PASS THIS ONE UP."
3,good in the right conditions....,The kite kept wanting to make a right turn into the ground. Tried adjusting the bridle loop and streamers and still same results. Wind speed may have been greater than 15 mph stated on package. It is made really well. If it would fly it would be great!
3,Just OK,"Although well made, I did not like the embroidery on the back of the shirt. The fabric is bulky so it will bunch up around the pupster head. The waistband because made the shirt ride up around the middle. I cut a slit under the hoodie part but but it still seemed bulky. If I would have ordered a size up it would have fit better."
5,Hebrew Word Pictures,"I liked it so much I'm buying a second one for a friend. The History is so rich with information, and you'll find explanations to questions you would have never thought to ask in a life time. EXCEPTIONAL BOOK. Every Serious Bible Student should have one."
5,Hebrew Word Pictures,"This is an amazing book about our amazing God! Get this book!! Mr. Seekins has done much for our study of the Hebrew language, which in turn has increased our love for searching out the things of God, and thusly, our search for The Lord, Himself!"
5,Fantastic Pellet Gun,"I recieved this pellet gun for Christmas over 20 years ago when I was 11. I have shot thousands of rounds through it, shooting target and small game, and can it can still hold a 1 inch grouping at 25 yards. Durable, powerful, and all around nice air rifle. I highly recommend it."
3,Little power,I just tried using my pellet gun a few months ago but haven't fired it in a few years. It pumps hard and the pellet gets 1/2 way down the barrel and hangs up. Would like to take it apart but can't find a schematic for reference. And I'm sure a gunsmith might charge what the gun is worth so I'm kind of hanging out there.
3,Not really worth it,"Two or three scenes where girls are nude and interviewed by the announcers (comedy sketches, sort of), but that's it. Julie Strain does not play tennis in this tape. Tennis is filmed at poor angles and is hard to watch when the camera is too far away."
5,A really enjoyable read,"This book tells a story. There's romance, mystery and some funny parts. The writer takes the time to divulge every minute detail, so you can relate to what's going on. That can make it tedious at times and even kind of slow, but it's part of the journey that this book relates. So if you're looking for a fast read, that you don't have to focus much on, this isn't that kind of book.This was the first book I've read by the author and I plan to read others by him. It was just a pleasure to read this!"
5,Great inspiration,"This book is so very helpful in planning speech and language therapy. The books suggested have been well researched, the plans explicit and easy to implement. I loved this book so much I used it as the ""bible"" of a group study another speech therapist and I did last year. She had never used literature as extensively as I have. As we delved into the wonderful children's books and how to use them, she found it to be an approach that is fun for both therapist and child, motivating and effective in bringing about significant change in children's speech and language.My enthusiasm was so effervescent about this book that my daughter, now a grad student in speech and language is using this book to help her plan for activities with her clinical literacy group."
4,Nighthawks poster Edward Hopper c1942,I bought this poster for a friend overseas who requested I locate same. It was very affordable and the packaging received was very protective of the poster and ready for me to forward overseas. My friend was very pleased with the poster. A very good value and another positive experience with Amazon!
3,"If it wasn't retro BSG, I wouldn't have bought it.","If you have read the other reviews you already know the difficulty is too high early on and inconsistant through out the game. The sub par flight controls are not as precise or intuitive as the Star Wars: Starfighter or Ace Combat games. You spend most of your time haphazardly destroying swarms of enemies and hope you're killing the right ones to complete the mission.The old school BSG format is what drew me to the game and while it's pretty good, it could of been better. The designers seemed to have gotten cold feet with going all in with the retro and had to throw in some of the new BSG elements like the new robot Cylons during the cinema portions.Buy it if your a BSG fan, otherwise there are much better games out there."
2,Not exactly?!?,"Potentially fun flight game, controls not as easy as could be,vague at times with objectives and direction."
5,Suck it up and buck up!!,"Graphics are good and flowing, action is non-stop right from the beginning and storyline is easily followed(provided you get past the first mission). There are no cheat codes, no easy settings and your mistakes will kill everyone. Repeatedly. Quit whining and learn how to fly your viper like the cylon killer you're supposed to be if you want to see more of the unfolding movie that this game is. I've been playing for 4 days off and on, and haven't gotten to the end yet, which is more than I can say for most games I've bought. It's actually refreshing NOT to be able to cheat for once."
4,A Great Game,"I bought this one yesterday and I'm hooked.The first couple of missions are a bit hard and take some getting used to, but the following missions make the hard work worth it, who wants a game that only last five minutes anyway.Some great graphics and awesome sound and speech."
4,Very Rewarding Game,Just picked this up yesterday and I'm already hooked.Yes it's a bit on the hard side (especially the second mission) but the gameplay in the following levels really makes it worth getting there.Some great graphics and awesome sound
4,Game is hard but awesome once you learn how to fly viper,"Hey if your a quiter then you do not want this game, if you like a challenge this is right up your alley. I love it. My only complaint is I wanted to get a good look at the raiders as I was shooting them and the game is so fast you don't often get a good look. But overall I am on level 10 and have had a great time !!"
1,Do not buy this game.,"I don't care how good the graphics are, or how great the sound is, the game is just unplayable. You don't have the ability to save the game when you need it. I'm stuck on the first level, with a stupid mission to protect the other viper pilots. I only have about 30 seconds to save them, before they die. And then I have to start the entire first level again. This happens about a half hour into the game. Play 20-30 minutes, then have 30 seconds to figure out what is going on... Yeah, good idea.I've warned you... don't waste your money. I sure wish that I hadn't."
3,You Must Be Kidding!!,"The Graphics of this game are awsome, sound also, but playability is just rediculous, even getting the hang of the game you are frustrated, they could have done it more realistic, it's a sad state when the troop carriers have more armor than a Basestar. Over all if your a fan of the show you will like it, however replay value is another story when or if you get through the frustration of getting through the 15 levels you will be happy to get rid of the game."
2,Is This Deck Now Out of Print?!?,"This deck--originally titled: *The G.D. RITUAL Tarot Deck--cost me almost $40.00. And the accompianing book is now about ten times as big as a POSTAGE STAMP (previously, it was apx 300 pgs and 8 1/2 X 11). I don't know, I mean; I ""used to"" like the deck--a lot--half a dozen yrs ago, but, now?A student ""talked me into"" buying it in order to be able to ""work w/him,"" three States away from me in Arizona.The ""flashing colors"" are usefull, but . . . I've obviously a lot of ""problems"" w/it, in general. Starting w/: ""Why'd the Cicero's go and change the name of the deck in the first place? Moreover, why'd they NOT use a ""k"" in the spelling of 'Magic'?"""
4,The Most Traditional Golden Dawn Deck,"Well I have wanted a Golden Dawn tarot for years and I am a Golden Dawn member. There are like 3 different Golden Dawn decks, and I thought this was easily the best of them because it was the most traditional/normal deck compared to the Skrying tarot. There is quite a bit of nudity on the cards depicting humans but they are not very realistic, meaning they do not look like a photograph of a human. I also like the idea of including a unique book with the deck. Companion books for a specific deck are usually at least another 10 dollars and here is included one for the same price of a regular sized deck."
5,beautiful,"a stunning book about matching colors to different animals - the book is divided in half so you can keep the word ""red"" at the top, then flip through the book to match everything that is red - Eric Carle is, as usual, wonderful"
4,pretty good mix for snacking,"Huh. The batch I got didn't have corn-nuts in it, but it was still pretty good."
2,Not what I was looking for,"So this book, being wirtten by a rolfer and all, I expected it to go a little more indepth and anatomical on the subject, visualisations for correcting posture, drawings of different postures and how to cope with them... definitely something more that what I found in this book.Although there is valuable information here in this book, if you took out everything that dosent relate to posture (which is similar to other books that offer spiritual meditative common sense), the book becomes tiny, the book is already quite small in size and has 100 pages only.I like the book, but I was expecting more speciality information.A good read though. I connect with what he says but its not what I thought I was paying for.Reading this book was not a waste of time though."
1,I feel I've been cheated,"With only 16 lines per page and 120 pages (+introduction etc) this thing should really be an article, not a book. Since there are not much text, of couse the book reads fast, but you don't get much information either. The amount of useful information you get (as opposed to a lot of common knowlengde) would probably have fitted into three normal letter-sized pages. This boils down to: I think the author had a few tricks he would write a book on, then he added a lot of common knowlendge, and then enlarged the font to get a book. My opinion: Not at all worth the money, I feel I've been cheated. I've never been so disappointed after receiving a book."
3,How many times can an author rate his own book?,"Looks like he has two ratings under his own name and then several others from ""a reader"" which have many suspicious consistencies. Interesting, and I almost bought this book."
1,STOP!!!! Dont buy this book!,"STOP!!! Don't buy this book! It is clear that the author is only out to make money and it will catch up to him. Aka ""you reap what you sow"" This book has some of the biggest print I've ever seen, and the information that it provides is mainly common sense. If you are looking to learn something this book is not the place to look. I can not see how Mr. Mogil could even look at himself in the mirror let alone judge another person."
3,Not a book!,"I am sorry to say that I was disappointed by this book. Excuse me, not a book. The content qualifies for a good article, not for a book. I guess the size of the printed words, suited for a pre-schooler, was necessary to make it a book!"
1,Can we have an option for 0 stars?,Whoever watches this show is obviously not that intelligent. That's all I wanted to say.
1,Im very dissapointed,I have ordered this a week ago for my 16 year old daughter and now I still haven't recieved it. I emailed you people back 5 times and you haven't responded to me and now my daughter is really upset at me. Please email me back.Sally
4,Worth a watch,"MTV's pseudo-reality series is back with a second season that far surpasses the ""drama"" of it's first. The show is quite convincing as a ""reality"" show; none of the dialogue appears contrived or forced though it lacks any storyline thereof. The extras on the DVD are excellent especially those found in Target's special edition which includes three episodes of another MTV hit ""Sweet Sixteen."""
5,I'M SOOO EXCITED,"I thought this season was never gonna come out since it took so long. I never did get to see the graduation for season 2 so im so anxious to pop it in the DVD player. I cant get enough of Laguna Beach---especially LC. She seems so cool and down to earth(she's my favorite on the show, along with Stephen). If you havent got the DVD, get it. Its the best."
1,What happened to living your own lives?,"I have been to the Ocean County in California. And trust me the television portrayal is a lot different. Never mind let me rephrase that. Anything MTV portrays is a lot different in ""reality"" -- I am talking about real life not MTV's laughable reality.If watching other people with money is your cup of tea, then by all means dumb yourself down by watching this junk. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.But watching this for free on MTV and buying it takes you to a new low, which a large section of those still with brains in our hands would scoff at you. How about kill your brains cells the old fashioned way, with alcohol, and not by watching this show..."
3,Laguna Beach,"Bought this for my daughter - who LOVES it! If you're a LAGUNA BEACH fan - buy it. Personally, I have never watched this annoying program!"
4,More Drama then the first!!!,"Laguna beach second series has way more drama than the first series!It focuses on more of the lives of the characters in the series, not just the 1 love triangle. Kristin is still as annoying as ever!!! My favourite new characters Alex M and Taylors so cute!!!"
1,Laguna Beach,Very disappointed not with the DVD but the product. We can only view via our PC & not TV because of the different region on our DVD player. We have gone to no end of trouble to try to sort it & all we can do is burn it to play on our TV. I have bought One Tree Hill & had no problems so didn't expect this. Had same problem with The Witness & Almost Famous.I hesitate to buy anything further through Amazon.
2,Too Superficial to be beneficial,"This book can either be good or very bad depending upon what you want out of it.If you are looking for a book to help you strategically help you decide upon which franchise that would be most suitable and profitable for you, then skip this one.This book will best serve those people who are at the very beginning of thinking about openning up a franchise. In fact, those people may even be disappointed as well.This book gives a very quick synopsis on the different franchises available. There is very little differentiation between the different franchising, with the exception of product type. For example, you can examine the different pizza franchises, but don't get enough information about which franchises are best.So, if you are looking for just a few thumbnail sketches at the highest level, then you will probably enjoy this book. If you are looking for something more, then keep looking."
3,Nothing Spectacular just OK.,"I was hoping for a little bit more out of this book than I received. There are better high contrast books out there with better pictures and ""verbage"" if you know what I mean. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that she just felt like it was missing the whole rhyming thing. I liked the whole ""I kissed the baby. Did you kiss the baby?"", but had they added somewhat of a rhyming story line, the book could have been a home-run. I guess I just expect baby books to ""flow"" a little better than this one did. My little girl listened to the story and looked at the pictures, but it didn't hold her attention like her other high contrast books. If the whole flowing, rhyming thing, isn't an issue for you, then this is the right book for you."
5,My son stares at this book and I love reading it....,My baby stared at the pictures from when he was about 2 months old. It's been pretty much the only book that captivates his attention. I really love reading it too. ( I can't get used to the books with no words or one 1 word per page. It makes me feel like we're looking at books in silence. It's so much more fun that he can hear mommy's voice. But I guess that's personal preference. ) The words are simple and sound nice to read. I've pretty much memorized them so that I can look at his face as he stares into the pictures. It's one of my favorite books.
4,"Cute, but doesn't keep the attention of my 10 month old",My little one mostly just likes the part at the end when the momma duck kisses the baby and the baby quacks. She will just flip through the rest until we get to that part. Probably because we act out that part with her to make it more fun. She loves to kiss her favorite characters in books and she likes animal sounds. The black and white contrast would be great for newborns but my baby doesn't care too much about this one from 9 months when we got it until now a month later. I still gave it 4 stars because I love the story line and know I will read it to my future babies at an even younger age!
5,"very cute i love it ,my baby gets so excited when he looks at the images","this book is very simple and attractive for infants ,as there is high contrast n good illustrations.my baby gets so excited watchng it evertime i show him."
1,"Oh, this is a good book!","I received this as a baby gift for my youngest daughter who is now 4 months. It has eight two page layouts with alternating black and white graphics (one layout has a white background with black pictures, the next a black background with white pictures) at the end you meet the baby who is a yellow duckling. My daughter will stare at this book until someone reads it to her and she loves the duckling. It has engaging singsong repetitious dialouge that my daughter loves, and the book is just long enough for a baby's attention span, if it's too short, start over and read it again! They'll love it!!"
3,Could have been better,"This is a pretty good effort by Peach. Most of the breasts appear to be real. There is a general absence of tattoos and the kind of body piercings I dislike. (See below.) Full frontal and rear exposures generally are pretty good. There are two girl/girl sequences that are lacking in this regard. With Peach you generally know what you get and don't get. Peach has done better than this one.Personal preferences: I prefer normal breasts to fake ones. (I really don't mind breast implants that have a semblance of normality to them. I really dislike the circular and flattish kind that I find grotesque.) I don't care for a lot of tattoos. In terms of body piercings, I rather like navel piercings, considering them decorative. However, I consider tongue, nipple, clitoral and labial piercings to constitute self-mutilation and find them grotesque. I consider the best Penthouse dvds to be the gold standard in soft core. Peach comes in second followed by Playboy and Vivid."
5,Trunk organizer,"Arrived on time in the condition described. It was very easy to install and has stayed in place. No more windshield wiper fluid thumping around in the trunk or groceries being in the back, out of reach, by the time I get them home! Would recommend to anyone, I love it!"
5,It's exactly what I was looking for,"We have been searching for another 3 pocket web storage net, since the first one we purchased for our other SUV came from a store that no longer carries them. This is a great product to keep items from rolling around in the cargo area, especially when the seats are down and also to keep them from falling out when the lift gate is raised. Fast shipping and excellent wrapping as well."
4,Exactly as described,This product matches the description in all ways. Order and delivery were quick and efficient. I have used the product for a couple of weeks and am very happy with it.
1,Does not hold,"The tape does not hold the parts up that are needed to hold the netting up. The netting itself is pretty sturdy but I refuse to drill holes into my brand new suv to hold up $16 worth of netting. Also my pre existing hooks are not compatible with this net. I drive a 2012 equinox, guess I'll be going back to the dealership for their cargo net."
2,Bring your own adhesive,"Be warned: the net part is fine -- but finding a way to hang it is another matter. Most cars don't have obvious places to drill holes for the metal screws -- leaving the adhesive the only way to affix the hangers. I followed directions for the adhesive TO THE LETTER, but the hangers never stayed stuck for more than a few hours. I finally resorted to a tube of adhesive from the hardware store."
3,Storage net only nets 3 stars,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the ""stick-on"" hooks are worthless. I have a 2011 vehicle and I am not about to start drilling holes for the hardware option. Unless you are lucky enough to have a vehicle with existing hooks in the correct spots to which the net can be fastened, you have limited options. 1)You can try some super glue on the plastic hooks that come with the product, 2)you can attach the net in some fashion the the existing hooks in your vehicle, or 3)you can buy better stick-on hooks and see if they work."
3,Smaller than thought,"Good ""little"" product. However it is smaller than it appears in the picture. When attached to the hooks for a net in the back of my SUV, it does not touch the bottom as shown. It hangs above and has small compartments. But it works well for smaller items you want to hang above larger items already loaded in the back."
1,Don't buy!,I bought this for the back of my SUV and you either have to use screws and drill holes in your truck to get it to stay in place or use the sticky dot things they send with it. First I'm not going to drill holes in my truck and the sticky dots don't stick so this item is pretty much worthless unless you have hooks that are part of your truck in the back that you can hook the stings in.
2,Highland 95013 review,"I'm sure that this is a wonderful product, it just doesn't meet my needs. I selected it after googling a storage net for my new SUV. There is no way to connect it without drilling holes and it isn't large enough to stretch from side to side in the cargo area. I have one of the smaller SUVs so I don't think it would work in any SUV."
1,Wasted my money,"Glue does not stick to the trunk sides, thus it cannot be installed. I could screw it in, but I did not want to damage the panels. Wound up throwing it out. Wasted my money."
4,Is what it is,cool cargo net does what is was supposed to do looks good and feels great. I would recommend buying this product.
3,Good product,This is a handy product to have. Do not use the sticky pads to mount. It will not hold for long. I would not purchase this unless you have other means of mounting the net attachment to the car.
1,"Beware, wont work with existing hooks","The item was listed as compatible with my Hyundai Veracruz, but I found that meant you had to deface the inside of the SUV. It cannot use the hooks already in the SUV. You have to screw new knobs to the inside of the SUV for it to work. Not something I care to do in a brand new vehicle."
2,crappy design,"my infinity did not come with a cargo net and I was sick of the grocery's spilling all over the back so I purchased this. first, the ""sick on attachments"" that is comes with are crap. it wouldn't stick to glue. plus, I didn't want to stick something to the panel and have it leave a residue. Nor did I want to drill holes into the panel. so I went to home depot, bought some clasps and connected it to the tie-downs in the trunk. that worked fine, but then one of elastics snapped. I was able to tie back on. its been holding strong, but this seems like way too much work for such a simple product. maybe I should have just bought the OEM brand. oh well"
4,Great Nets But Difficult To Mount,"So far I have had these nets about a month and I have been relatively pleased with them.The nets are well made and can stretch a good amount with their elasticity, just beware that overtime they will stretch permanently as you put heavier items in (This isn't necessarily a bad thing since all I needed these for is to keep items from running a muck in my huge trunk).The only problems I've had at all with this product are some slight net fraying (nothing serious) and mounting the net. As other reviewers have pointed out, the mounting hardware is garbage so I ended up getting creative and using a combination of zip-ties to set this net up in the trunk of my Lincoln sedan. Because of these small issues I unfortunately had to dock a star.Overall a decent product and I'd consider it a steal if you can get it for under $15."
4,Fits 2008 Hyundai Sonata,"As a father of a 5-year old, I find it quite useful keeping my Sonata's trunk tidy. Used the existing hooks in my Sonata; no drilling, no glueing. Just be careful that things with zippers (e.g., my son's lunchbox) does not get tangled with the mesh."
2,Requires more work than they are worth,"A great concept but poor outcomes. Unless your car comes with fittings for a storage net, you pretty much have to drill into your car. I'm notdoing that with an aftermarket product and possibly loose the warranty on the car. I'm sure it will be great for cars with fittings but for my is was a bad buy."
1,Didn't Fit,This net didn't fit my 2011 Highlander. My Highlander has built in hooks but this net didn't fit on those. I personally didn't want to install the hooks that came with the net because they do not match my vehicle interior.
5,Perfect in my trunk. See how long they last.,"Item was of the most fantastic quality. Perfect fit in my setup. Delivery was high-standard. Would buy from again. A very, very excellent product."
1,Not What I Expected,I was very disappointed in this product. The tabs do not stick well to the vehicle and I refuse to drill any holes in my vehicle for a net. I would not recommend this product to others.
1,Waste of $$$,"When something claims to 'fit' your vehicle you don't expect to have to drill holes to make it happen. Of course the is the adhesive option, unfortunately the adhesive provided doesn't stick to anything but the backing paper you remove. Do NOT purchase unless you already have 4 points to hook it to."
3,"Great Quality, Does not work in 2011 highlander","The netting is very well made and very durable. Its a little too well made though. The loops are too wide for my factory hooks.I unscrewed the factory hooks, to try to swap them with the included hooks. When I punched a hole threw the ""thin membrane"", It just made a mark of my phillips head. It really needed to be drilled out.for the other 2 hooks, my highlander's interior body panels are about 6"" away from any steel body to drill into. I wasn't going to drill into the interior panel of the car and ""hope"" it would be enough material. So I had to send it back3 stars because it does not work for me. I would rate the quality overall as 4 stars easy. I think this would be great for a truck bed or older suv."
2,Net,"The cargo net fit, but the install was not so easy. I did not want to drill any holes in my new vehicle, so I got some hooks to attach. It works, but not the best product for my needs."
3,Adhesives don't work,"The adhesive strips provided with this product won't hold on a textured surface, which is what my Toyota Highlander has (as does most vehicles). If you're going to use this you will have to either screw them into you car's interior panels or use a much stronger glue you supply yourself."
3,OK for the plane.,"The book is an OK read. The plot and characters are OK, nothing great, but for seven bucks you can read it and leave it on the plane. I'll give mine to charity since I'll read other books rather than this one twice."
2,Crash and Burn,"I had trouble reading this book, but I did finish it. I do not think you can really write a review on a book without reading the book. How else would you know how flat the story was, or how poorly written the book was? I already wasted my time reading the book, so I feel this is all the time I need to waste on reviewing it. Buyer Beware!"
1,Stick to Politics Roy!,"It is highly significant that no Salvation Army personel recommend this book. The author, being unsaved and a senior British politician, concentrates on the radical social reforms the Booths and Salvation Army championed in Victorian Britain. Hattersley, sadly, hasn't a clue about salvation. I suspect Roy's next book may portray Christ as a zealous Jewish Zionist with Marxist leanings. Well written fluff. Now Roy's managed to write a book about John Wesley characterising him as a lecherous toad. Don't waste your money.For a far better biography of William and Catherine Booth, get Trevor Yaxley's. And for John Wesley, read John Pollock's."
5,Another great score by Chattaway,"Jay Chattaway has composed some nice scores for several TNG episodes on this soundtrack. Along with music from Tin Man, Sub Rosa, The Inner Light, and A Fistful of Datas, music from the episodes Dark Page, Descent, and Birthright can also be found on this CD. (By the way, the score from The Inner Light is different from the one on the 30th Anniversary CD.) My personal favorites? Well, I enjoyed the music from Dark Page and Sub Rosa the most, but the others are great as well."
5,In The Studio,"I had the unique pleasure of being on hand for the birth of this masterpiece. I owned the recording studio (White Crow) where it was recorded in Vermont. In the studio's twelve year life, this project took the cake as the most creative we experienced. (Others included Phish and Alice Cooper) The album was completely conceived in the studio, melodies and rhythms being invented in the lounge over lunch without instruments. When something began to cook, these three mad scientists sprinted into the studio and began putting it down.Torn's guitar collection for the session was only to be outdone by Bozzio's ""drum kit"" which arrived in a 24-foot truck and took up most of the main studio. Among other things, Bozzio set up two octaves of roto toms so that he could trade melodies with Torn. That's the level these guys were operating on.Polytown continues to be one of my favorite recordings."
5,Beautiful American Cloe Rocks!!!!!!,This cloe doll was my gift for independence day. I held her in my hands while watching fireworks.This doll is awesome. I brings awesome trendy clothes. I wish I had her clothes!!!!!!
5,the perfect independece day doll,4th of july cloe is so cool. it looks like a regular cloe but with a little american blits to it i love it dose not over do the american thing. and it has a great them America nothing bad about this doll.
4,Fun 'n Fabulous!,"The new ""IndepenDance"" Cloe is the third in the collector's series and is so far the best holiday themed doll. Like the first two, Cloe comes with an array of tiny red, white and blue hair and jewelry accessories that are the perfect compliment for the American flag inspired outfits. Cloe is definetely the flashier of the Bratz collectables with her embroidered and beaded jeans, her ""gemstone"" American flag Tee and red suede jacket, not to mention her new itricate 'do and the more realistic look to her blue eyes. And though this Bratz doll is a great addition to a doll and/or Americanna collection, my only ""gripe"" is why the company chose Cloe, and not Sasha or Yasmin for its Fourth of July themed Brat."
3,Cute....,"My sister just got this doll. I was VERY impressed with her or her clothing, accessories, or even make-up. Her face is a little strange looking compared to all the other bratz dolls faces. Her eyes ar too close together and are too big. She has pretty cute clothing I love the red trench coat she comes with, it's adorable! XD Overall she's alright."
3,What a firecracker?,Got this to save as a present for my cousin's daughter whose birthday is in July. Got to say I am very impressed with the detail on the face and clothing of this Bratz doll. I really like the unique holiday concept of the clothing. How hip is this outfit? I think I'm going to start taking fashion tips from the Bratz. They are stylin' and profilin' better than ole Paris Hilton.
3,mosquito catcher,"This unit uses heat and light to attract mosquitoes. It performs how the video showed, but whether it is keeping the mosquito population down is questionable. It also absolutely does not say what the effective range is in the manual or the video. It just says put it out there in the right spot and it will control the population. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I'm still hesitant to stay outside at night for more than a few minutes. Also the carpenter ants made a temporary home out of it for some reason, but they left. I am thinking of going to a unit that generates CO2. The bad thing about those is that they have an expendable filament that needs to be replaced every 2000 hours or so to work. The good thing is carbon dioxide is the biggest factor in mosquito attraction, with heat a distant second and light and even more distant third."
1,Not too useful on Long Island,I left this thing on for 3 weeks straight. I think I caught 4 mosquitos in that time period plus some lady bugs. I'm not sure if it's a LONG ISLAND MOSQUITO that doesn't care for the blue light but they just don't seem to be attracted to it. I was still getting bitten every time I went out (when I stood still) and I did not see a decrease in mosquito activity.
1,Doesn't work - period.,"I'd echo the majority of the other reviews...this thing is noisy and makes no measurable difference in the mosquito population in my yard. I also suspect it contributed to my increased electric bill, to boot. Keep looking - there are other more effective solutions out there."
2,Buy a box fan instead,"The fan motor produces heat to attract the bugs, the fan blades cut them up... Save yourself some money buy a box fan and put some Christmas lights around it. At least you'll be cooler and it'll be quieter.."
1,5 stars?,NOtice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone.Sounds like employees trying to build up ratings.
5,Works Great,"After trying two propane mosquito traps both by (Flowtron) that turned out to be faulty.We decided to try the TekQuest Mosquito catcher. Now going on its third season. This work horse is still going strong. This realy works without the propane tank or CO2. This unit works just like they state in the Product features paragraph listed above. They do have a web site http://www.rushhampton.com/mc_inf-R.pdfThis year I added a Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridge. It seems to do a little better, but works just fine without it."
1,didn't work for me,"This thing is terrible. It only caught a few unlucky moths who accidentally got stuck inside. Meanwhile, mosquitoes were everywhere not getting caught in the catcher."
1,"It did NOT help, it seemed to make matters worse.","I tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some, I didnot see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes, actually thereseemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed.I did try different locations.Perhaps they are attracted to it, but they are not being sucked in.Looking at the tray, it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects."
3,Didn't work for me,Tried it for over a week and not a single mosquito appeared in the trap. I also didn't like the fact that it couldn't get even a little wet. I guess if you have a covered patio or something maybe it'd be fine but not out here in the woods of Maine.
1,Not pleased,"My yard is still infested with mosquitoes after running this item since the beginning of the season (over two months ago). I thought that the conditions would improve with usage. Unfortunately, we still are inundated with mosquitoes when we go outside. Location is in one of the lake regions of Maine. Consequently, I cannot recommend this item and I regret that I did not return it within the allowable return period."
1,Does not work,"I had hoped from the positive reviews that this system would actually work and make my backyard a fun place for my children to play without all the nasty chemicals. Unfortunately, the system did not make that possible. It does indeed catch mosquitos. I watched the DVD they provided and could see that it was working in terms of catching the bugs. However, the real test of how well it works, as the DVD points out, is whether you can enjoy the outdoors without getting attacked by mosquitos. Despite running the system 24/7 for 3-4 weeks, our backyard was as buggy as ever. I even used low-level DEET sprays (5%) to see if we could reduce the amount of DEET. They still were bitten. Our nanny, poor thing, was covered in bites on her exposed ankles. We returned the system last week and are back to using 7% DEET sprays on the girls, which works."
2,Not much luck with this device...,"I ran this unit 24 hours a day 7 days a week for a couple of months and it really had no impact on the mosquito population in my back yard. The bug trap never really filled up though it did seem to catch an occasional moth, fly or other random flying bug. I can't say that it never caught a mosquito and it does catch something so I'd give it two stars. Looks like the next step is propane powered mosquito catchers. One other thing of note, unless you want to place this less than three feet from your house or power socket, you'll have to buy an extension cord."
5,Great halloween costume,"I think this could be fun. If there was milk in it, that is. Another drawback on this, everywhere I went, people were screaming,'I FOUND HIM', at me and trying to drag me away to the police station."
2,Copy Cat Fianna,"Anyone notice a problem with ""Funk Out! Fianna""???? Almost her entire wardrobe was copied from previous Bratz dolls and outfits. For example, a real obvious one is her jeans, burgundy tank top, and headband. It was totally copied from one of the Bratz outfit packs. The skirt- minus the belt- was the same as one of Dana's skirts from another set. The actual Fianna doll is kind of cute, but you think MGA could have at least given her original outfits. This doll is a class- A COPY CAT!"
3,This Iz FiAnnA???,"ummmm, this doll is a MAJOR dissapointment!!!!! dont let her looks fool you, yeah she's pretty but shes full of flaws. her hair is flat and dead looking, and it feels like a bad weave, and then on one side its like short, like as if she wanted her hair short or something, but then decided to change her mind in the middle of the haircut *BiZzArE* and the cheap shawl she came with started to tatter and unravel into like a million stringz! *UGH* but that was fine i really didnt like the shawl thing anyway. then when i put her on my shelf for display, she fell over and bumped her head on something, and her EYEBROW paint smeared over her eye, and now it looks like she has some kind of freaky birthmark, that is so not cute. i'm so dissapointed, i thought MGA made thingz that weren't so cheap, especially for the $$$ they make you pay."
2,uhww..?,The doll is pretty but she haves a hugh head.That's why she haves a classic on.Her clothes are pretty but her make-up colour is wierd.A pity of her head really the hugh for me.
3,Haunted Spacecraft?,"Dark Side Of The Moon is an enjoyable Sci-fi thriller. It starts like haunted spacecraft story in 2022 when the malfunctioned space station rendezvous with Spacecraft Discovery the crew later find out the fact that it had vanished in Bermuda Triangle in 1992. The spacecraft now thirty years old is eerily intact but there seems to be no living souls around. After the crew encounter the dead body of one of the missing Discovery crew, the story turns like sort of Alien series. Something evil embodies to human body through human contact with the perfect triangle scar mark on the victim's abdomen (and it begets another victim like vampire stories). Suspension heats up when the crew started to suspect each other. Although trying to connect Bermuda triangle mystery with that of dark side of the moon is not so convincing, it will please the fans of Sci-fi movies."
5,A Lot of Fun !,"This pistol is just like the one from yester year. The .22 cal. has just enough pop to target practice with or take out small game(30 to 40 Feet). The quality is outstanding. It was alittle hard to pump at first, but after about 20 to 30 shots it seemed to get easyer. After all it is a pump pistol not a rifle and it will take more power to pump it up."
4,Expected More,Item shipped quickly and in good packaging. The air pistol performs okay. My complaints are that the bolt does not lock and stay in place as it should. It acts like it wants to but when the pistol is tilted it slides back. I was also expecting a higher quality finished product. It would also be nice if the wood stock or somewhere else had the product name engraved or carved on it. I paid more for this model versus the cheaper plastic model because I wanted and expected more. It performs as advertised and looks as it will last a long time.
3,quality is just so so,"8 pumps are not for young child.This pistol hits really hard with good accuracy. After a couple of hours shooting, however, i find little crevice and scratch on the forearm(near the screw). I am afraid the wood will not withstand for a long time.The forearm is so small and thin(at least for me) you may also hurt your finger while pumping, be careful.Finally, it seems that this pistol is not that powerful after accounting for the effort required. My HW45(beeman p-1) hits as hard as this pistol(with 5-6 pumps) while the cocking effort is only 18lbs. I will still recommand this product since it's ok for a Multi-Stroke Pneumatic air pistol."
1,if only they had half stars,it suks omg it is the worst gun ever and for 140 bucks it broke after like the 5th shot but those 5 shots it was awesome
4,"Worth it for ""A Quick One"" alone","Although I love the whole record, the version of ""A Quick One (While He's Away)"" on this record is one of the greatest live performances in rock history. I know that sounds like silly fanboy hyperbole, but the finale of the song is absolutely awe-inspiring. The performance comes from the Rolling Stones Rock'n'Roll Circus, a tv special that was never aired because the Stones were not satisfied with their own performance.This version of "" A Quick One"" reveals the Who before they became international maga-stars with Tommy - snarling, explosive, triumphant punks with a sound that no band could match. No wonder the Rolloing Stones buried the show in a vault for 30 years; there was no way that they could match such an incredible performance. Truly one of the 10 greatest live moments from 60's rock."
3,Great Music that does not Work as an Album!,"""The Kids Are Alright"" is the original soundtrack from the documentary of the same name. It's a mixture of studio- and live recordings from various stages of the Who's career.There are a lot of great recordings, though some suffer from poor sound quality. Some of the very last live recordings to feature original drummer Keith Moon, show that the band was still on top, when Moon sadly passed away. His playing on ""Sparks"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" is impressive.Though the sound is far from perfect I also enjoy the version of ""A Quick One"" from the Rolling Stones'""Rock 'N' Roll Circus"".Though there is lot of great music, I somehow feel that the CD does not work as an album. Too much variety in sound and sound quality - the music is taken from very different stages of their career - and the shifting from live to studio and back again gives an overall uneven impression."
3,"Universal, almost.....","In theory, this hose bibb lockout is perfect - the design is really neat and I am sure that in most cases it works a treat. Down here in Texas (out Katy, TX way) perhaps we have different hose bibbs as this just doesn't fit on ours. In the image shown with the product, the faucet has no additional pieces on it, and the lock mechanism fits perfectly. For ours, we have a section that is wider than the threading on the bibb, just above it (ie coming from the horizontal piece of tapeware down towards the bib thread. This means that the outer (silver) component can't get far enough over the inner component, o the tongue doesn't stick out far enough for the lock to pass through. Our bad luck i guess. other than this issue, it's a great product, turned up reasonably quickly and is ok value for money."
5,Saved our office $$$$$$,"We noticed that we had a real problem as thousands of gallons of water kept going missing every weekend at a property in Houston, Texas. We worked with the local water department to see if there was a leak. After checking all the plumbing fixtures, we decided to try a simple lock on all the facets.Problem fixed. Appears someone was coming around on Sunday's and filling up a tank or something and costing us a lot of money. The city is now prusuing this matter and we have all four facets locked up.A simpel fix and great results."
5,Great product!,We live in a new subdivision and have caught construction workers stealing water twice already. I ordered two of these and am extremely pleased - perfect for protecting against water theft!
2,May want to keep this lubricated,"My homeowner's association bought and installed some of these a few years ago. All this time they seemed to work well, and we rarely used the water so have left them on. Over the years, dirt and grime have gotten to them. Tonight we had a need to unlock them. Some we have heavy duty key style padlocks, while others we had those 4 digit spindle locks which have seized up, presumably from rust. Since I didn't have my bolt cutters onsite, I examined how these work from the one I could get off. A few minutes later, I had the remaining locks removed and will cut the pad locks later. To remove these you just need to establish enough friction while pulling and turning the lock from the bibb. I didn't initially install, so I don't have the instructions, but would recommend lubrication and regular (at least annual) cleaning to prevent dirt build up."
4,There's great fun and creativity here!,"Think of your T-shirts as a ""blank canvas"" and you can get ready to create a dazzling array of personalized art that is truly one of a kind! Turn your T-shirt into another shirt entirely, shorts, pillow, apron, chair cover, dress or a totally new and dazzling kind of top that noone will ever recognize as your old shirt!This is a fun way to save money while forging your new career as a fashionista!"
2,t-shirt overkill,"The reference to craft ""superstars"" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, café curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it?"
2,"Uh...no, not really.","Nice idea, but poorly done. Craft is weak, there are threads hanging in the photos, seriously people! There are perhaps 6 projects that are worth doing, 3 of which are pretty spiffy, but for the most part the projects are a mess few people would wear let alone bother making."
4,very good,this is for my 16 year old daughter and she is able to use it with ease and make many garments from the patterns
3,a little disappointed,"I think I expected too much. I like that they used ideas from different designers and crafters but not all were practical and some werent worth the time and effort to make. The ""button down t-shirt"" was great. The ""skirt"", was not (it could have benefited from a few more illustrations or clearer instructions and what was with using the leftover sleeve to patch the triangle-gap left in the corner of the skirt? I would prefer a how-to on making a skirt that DOESNT have a gap. That's just sloppy looking). The ""stuffed animals"", rugs, ipod coozies, and chair covers are really just simple project ideas you can find for free by browsing the web. I expected more instruction on wearable clothing."
3,OK...not the best on the subject...,"I bought this book, Rip It, and Generation T together. Generation T is the best of the three, this book is so-so and Rip it is totally skipworthy:(I'd say about half this projects in this book are attention getting-sadly the other half are the same old same old.Like placemats, or a rug that you need to buy SIX XXL t shirts to make?, a necklace made of fabric covered ping pong balls?, and several T shirts with a bit of embroidery or applique and THAT'S supposed to be inspired by top designers?There are a couple of fairly good projects that would justify the $10 here on Amazon-but if money is tight, then I'd say skip it and get Generation T instead.3 stars..."
1,No puppets!,"Ok, look people. I don't understand what the big deal of this is. Like, it's from the 1960s- you know- during the Cold War period. So, I suspose the only reason why people liked it was because they associated us (Thunderbird team) with the Soviets (Aliens). But the Cold War is- like- over. So why should we dwell on stupid, hand-made puppets when there are cool sci-fi shows out there minus the pupets! The characters were also poorly designed. Lady Penny, what a wimp! The Alan bros- lifeless!"
2,Nice looking knife.,"I give it 2 because,when I got the knife's,the wooden handle has a crack between the two brass ring and lower left hand side.I am very dissappointed of the quality that S&W is puting out.What's the S&W quality control doing??got his thumb up his a_ _. This knife suppose to be commemorative for The Texas Rangers,atleast show some quality and pride on the product.Thank You."
4,Good little camera,"I received everything I expected. Easy to use and reliable. Not may features, but for the price it is a great camera."
3,Good for starter camera,"Price was right for this camera, but miss some of the remote control features available on higher price cameras. Like the software that comes with it.Include software: D-Link D-View software is more comprehensive and has better features for alerting. I like the other s/w interface with IP-View better (simpler), but the alerting features were not as good as D-Link D-View.Also the include manuals in .pdf are poorly written, with bad grammar and provide barely any additional information, but I did find the support documents on the D-Link web site very helpful.Overall I can recommend this camera as a basic starter camera to begin home security system."
5,Great results with a networking expert,"This camera can cause frustrations when one is not educated enough about IP settings, Gateway, and many other technicalities, including ISP service requirements to be able to program the camera for browser viewing and knowing how to ""ping"" your Windows XP system to track the wireless progress of settings made.I gave up, and found a friend in the very NETWORKING profession.Even that person and his colleague arrived and spent 3 hours to make everything work, and the ISP (internet service provider) had to change the account to a ""bridged account"" with a stationary IP assigned.[...]with a crystal clear video live of our wind turbine readout in kilowatts.Its a fabulous camera when a friend can set it up for you at that very reasonable price, and more cameras could be added.Our advice: FIND A FRIEND who is on top of networking.Jan and Wolf"
2,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't","Flakey, like nearly all of D-Link's wireless products.Some days it works, connecting fine to the Dlink WPA-PSK router I have, and sometimes it won't connect at all.The 100mb/s wired ethernet always works, though, and works very well.A nice wired camera, that sometimes will do wireless as well."
1,NOT Mac compatible,"Apparently, does not work on Macs for set up. Only for viewing via browser. No excuses these days d-link!"
2,Think Twice,"I have 3 of these. One works well, one works not at all. Support was of no help and sending it back is costly and you get a refurbished replacement."
1,"Product discontinued-no support available, do not buy","Mine arrived, tried to set it up, wouldn't work, called support, product is discontinued, no support available. Asking for a refund is getting me a run-around, will probably have to enter a claim soon."
2,poor quality,"This is a poor blade, I ran the blade for about half an hour in my shop and took it off of my saw and put on the blade I tjust took off. Blade was noisy and did not leave a clean edge. I will us this blade for cuts where the quality is not as important."
3,windstar,"if your trying to find out where and how to replace the windshield wiper pumps,forget it ,not in this book ,but it does show how to do bondo on a totally diffrent vehicle (looks like a pick up truck),,i think it shows how to add wiper fluid ,who cares about the pumps??if you need your fuze diagram or lay out,you better still have your original manual that came with the van in 1996 , at least i couldnt find it in this book,those were the first 2 things i tried to find , and 2 strikes ,,i love car manuals!!!!!"
5,Love It,I absolutely love Felicity......it takes me way back and I now own the whole series....wish there could be more :)
5,Response to the change in music,"I LOVE Felicity! I can't wait to buy Season 3 & 4. The reason they changed the songs on the DVD from the original songs that were in the TV series is because of cost effectiveness. The DVD songs were just cheaper to get. Which is fine with me all-in-all. I think they're pretty good songs. In fact I've been driving myself crazy trying to find information on some of them. That's the big problem with them changing the songs, they don't give ANY information as to who the artist is or even the title of the song. I've been looking for the name & artist of the song played in Freshman season disc 1, episode 3 (""Boggled"") when Felicity is watching Ben try out for track and Noel sees her there at the end of the episode. It's a great song, but I'll probably never know who sings it or what it's called. Anyway, I love Felicity and it's great to be able to watch it whenever I want to (without commercials!)."
3,No original music on this DVD set!,While Felicity is a great show please be warned that almost all (if not all) original music has been replace for this DVD release with unknown songs. The atmospheric soundtrack is one of the things that made Felicity a great show. You will not get the same experience with this version. Be warned!
1,Boring with capitall B!,"the tv show is totaly boring, it is the same thing in every chapter, the typical story, but stupider. If you saw the first season you've seen it all, it is really not worth it, no wonder why it was cheap"
3,A Dissenting Voice,"I began to lose interest in ""Felicity"" during the second season. No, not because of the haircut. Certainly not because of the supporting characters: they were the main reason I continued watched it as long as I did. (Missed Julie though.) Not even because Noel was dumped--a foundation was laid for that.I lost interest because the writers/producers/whoevers came up with an idea that my required ""willing suspension of disbelief"" could not accept i.e.that Felicity and Ben would get together. Was there even a semi-solid foundation built for this event? Not really. Have I encountered this phenomenon in real life? No. Is it commonly found in other stories? Not after the kind of build-up found here.It's nice that many people seem to have enjoyed their (untimately disastrous) relationship. It kept Keri and the rest of the cast employed. And keeping especially the supporting cast employed and on the small screen was a significant acheivement."
3,Some of the MUSIC CHANGED,I have to say I didn't like the fact that they changed the music in the background from the scenes. I really liked that SANTANA song they played in the second episode when it was aired on The WB they replaced it with some really bad Latin instrumental music. Santana's music went with the scene and it went with the party scene. In other episodes and scenes I noticed they changed the music. I was really dissapointed that the Santana song was cut. I rather watch the recorded VHS tapes I have from The WB. I LIVE NEAR GREG GRUNGBERG (a.k.a Sean in Felicity) I will tell his wife about the music being cut and changed.
5,Love Felicity Series,I love it! I'm so happy the 4th season is out tomorrow. I've already ordered mine.
5,Love this series!,"As this is a review for Season Two, I'm guessing you've already watched Season One and fallen in love with this show! This follow-up season doesn't disappoint! Felicity finds herself in a new place after returning from her summer with Ben and discovers that her relationship with him may be more work than she was prepared for. This season is about her personal growth and more college experiences. Loved it!"
5,Excellent Quality,"I really enjoyed this season 2 sophomore year of Felicity. In my opinion it was the best season of all, especially when felicity and ben got together at the end. They make such a cute couple... I do recommend to buy this season...By the way I bought this season used and the quality of the dvd was excellent. Hope this help..."
4,really great show-lame music changing,"I love this show,it's so funny and moving,so it's a positive feeling buying felicity on dvd...But I still have the same fears:Is the songs were replaced?Sure they were!!!!!!!!!!And it's killing me!...The original songs were so much better it makes me want to scream...seriously,why on Smallville and Alias DVDs the songs were'nt replaced to?!...( so don't give me your too expensive crap)it's very unfair for Felicity which is half as good as the two precious shows mentioned and deserved a little bit more respect as for it fans.Seriously this drives nuts that i didn't put a 5/5 because the editors of the DVDs don't deserve it at all!..."
4,Great CD,The Cd was of good quality and the condition was good too I have no complaints. I will continue to watch this CD as many times as possible.
5,I love this show!,"This is by far one of my favorite tv series of all time. I enjoyed every minute of all 4 seasons and I want to know when the last 2 are coming out on DVD! Im dying to relive junior and senior year, when she finally starts to grow her hair back! I know it sounds strange but, this show has taught me so much. I have been able to relate to the character, Felicity, in a way that i have never connected with an on screen character before. Half the time I felt like i was watching my own life unfold. I love it!"
2,scratchy,I had to skip many episodes on these dvd's because they were so scratched. I am very disapointed in the product.
4,Worth it for the b-sides,"If you loved both of the ""Marmaid Avenue"" CDs, then you should get this -- if only for the beautiful accoustic version of ""At My Window Sad and Lonely."" I wish this version had been on the album instead! ""Bugeye Jim"" is another sad, resonator guitar track sonically similar to ""Black Wind Blowing"" or ""Eisler on the Go"" -- spooky, poetic.""My 30,000"" is a full-band romp blasting the KKK. Also fun, but perhaps the weakest new track here. The live version of ""California Stars"" is alright too, with a different spin taken on the song later on -- more rock instead of folk.Buy it before it goes out of print."
3,Unique Soundtrack CD for a Unique Movie,"I'll bet the farm that ALL buyers of this CD are those who've already seen the movie. There've been a couple of recordings of the actual title ballet music, but this CD is unique. It includes - as far as I can recall - practically all significant music cues, INCLUDING snippets of dialog. If you haven't seen the film,it all won't mean much; but as I've said, this is for fanatic ""Red Shoes"" movie repeaters. Quality is mediocre; unprocessed monophonic transfers from the soundtrack - hiss is evident thoughout. The 4-page pamphlet packs a surprising amount of info: plot synopsis, full production credits, cast, awards, and a Powell/Pressburger filmography; plus a short but pithy essay on the history of the movie. Thankfully, this is more than most soundtrack CDs include; but, come on fellas; better proofreading would be welcome - lots of typos and spelling howlers. Good fodder for balletomanes."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited when I first stumbled upon this album, which appears to be the full original score to The Red Shoes. It is complete, but only by virtue of the fact that it is lifted directly from the audio track of the movie itself. The sound quality is terrible, and the dialogue and sound effects have not been removed from the recording.To be fair, the original musical track has probably long since vanished. Because a great deal of the music is actively played rather than atmospheric, I can see a lot of these tracks being difficult to isolate. However, this is not the definitive disc I'd been - and am still - hoping for."
3,Charley Pride-GOOD-Video-Not too good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Charley Pride is good in his voice, appearance, and overall presentation. Only the video was very poor, somewhat distoreted, not too clear and that took away from really enjoying the concert. I hope his other ones are better. Also, it's very short, only half an hour and only 9 songs."
3,Comprehensive and Specific,"Ebba Waerland's method works by detoxifying the body with fasting, enemas, and alkaline diet. She recommends a lacto-vegetarian diet, mostly but not always raw. She speaks well of garlic, except in arthritis, and chlorophyll. She recommends sour milk or sauerkraut for bacterial flora, and condemns vaccinations, saying that they cause the diseases of civilization. I don't agree with her use of cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese, and homeopathy, but can't argue with her results, if we can believe the case histories in this book. I strongly disagree with her praise of garlic, which I regard as toxic.In fourteen chapters she discusses specific syndromes, both major and minor, from cancer to headaches. Her chapter on herbs is specific for various conditions. She gives detailed instructions and recipes, and her views on proper breathing, exercise, saunas, and spiritual and mental issues."
4,A necessary evil?,"Perhaps the best biography of Aleister Crowley out there, the author remains fair and balanced in his presentation of the very controversial life of a man whose name elicits a reaction in nearly anyone alive since his emergence in the media. The author is definitely fair and balanced, but to accomplish this he must present every relevant side and viewpoint. Citing an exhaustive amount of research, the picture of Crowley is built into a three dimensional historical figure as seen from the objective eye. The problem this exhaustive exploration produces in an incredibly dry piece of historical literature. The accuracy, validity, and honesty are much appreciated, but the reader is seemingly confronted with a dozen dates per page. This book manages to make one of the most controversial and heatedly debated lifetime dull and uninteresting! Completing a single chapter is like a hike across a dessert, and the voluminous size is a disheartening prospect as you slug through page after page."
3,great product but...,"When I received the product, there was an existing price tag on it that was many dollars less than what I was charged...other than that, Crest's product works very well."
2,Not working for me,"I've been using it for 10 days and I have yet to see any impressive results. I guess this works faster than a whitening toothpaste (10 days versus 2 months or so), but my teeth haven't changed much at all (more of a placebo effect).It really isn't that hard to apply--just like the instructions say, dry your teeth thoroughly, paint on one thin coat, let dry for half a minute or so, and don't eat.The side benefits were that it leaves the surface of your teeth feeling very smooth and prevents you from caving in to late night snacking."
2,Check dates!!!,"I actually bought this product a few days ago at a chain drugstore.I had some serious trouble applying the product, then found it didn't stay on very well and some of the packets were so shriveled that I couldn't get any product out of them and had to try another, so I decided to look at reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else has any tips...Then, having read someone else's review about the same problem, I checked the expiration date on the box. 2 months past.As I said, since it doesn't stay on too well, and my yield from the box will be much less than 14 days worth, I have to say the whitening effect isn't so pronounced."
5,Does what it says and doesn't cause pain...BRING BACK THE NIGHT EFFECTS WHITENING KIT PLEASE AMAZON!!!,This kit is getting harder & harder to find in stores and online. It's a great whitening kit and removes stains between teeth better than the whitening strips. I tried the whitening strips but they were too painful to use and I don't even have sensitive teeth! Please bring this product back Amazon!!!
5,Excellent Advanced Set,"This is a more advanced version of the Warrior Workout by Ravi and Anna and I prefer this one since it seems more compact. This is one of the Kundalini Yoga workouts I turn to when I am trying to lose or maintain my weight since it is cardio enough to qualify for ""exercise"" so I do not feel I have to do a workout dvd or run in order to get my work out in too besides just my yoga. Music is wonderful as always. This is a famous Yogi Bhajan set so it seems to flow a little more than some of the kundalini dvd sets that seem to be several kryia tacked together. This is not for the faint of heart and you might want to start with Ravi's version first and work up to this one since Erin does the exercises for longer periods of time."
4,Good enough,"I was hoping for something more obviously stepped up from the original DVD. If you already have the first one,you may prefer to get something else. I don't know what, but something else. If you wanted to go Ashtanga, Beryl Bender Birch's Power Yoga, I'd say."
5,wow!!!,"wow, what a work-out. She does a lot of Anna and Ravi routines, but a little more intense. The fire breath are intense and she holds her poses a little bit longer. I was sweating my butt off. I recomend this vide, and I also do Anna and Ravi dvd's. They are awesome too!!!!"
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,This would be a great book for someone collecting old outboard motors.I was looking for more technical information on an old Johnson I aquired recently (repair & maintanence).
2,Muslim Islamic 'End of World' Day,"""Major Signs of Qiyamat"" (Day of Judgment) by ""Maulana Mufti Mohammad Shafi""; translated by ""Mufti Afzal Hoosen Elias""; 12 (twelve) pages; paperback. Contents: Ahadith chosen by ""Hazrat Allama Sayed Muhammad Anwar Shah Kashmiri"", c. 1997."
1,Disgusted,"I've never been more upset after reading a romance novel. Adamas was a disgusting pig who basically used Annie and sexed her into submission at every chance. And why did he do this? For family members who were only concerned with themselves. I think I could possibly understand it if his family members had made an appearance and they had seemed even just a little bit likable or vulnerable, but they weren't. The side love story with Todd and Susie was laughable. Susie manipulates Todd at every chance she gets and treats one of his dearest friends like crap and everyone believes it when she says she ""loves"" him. WTF?? Am I living on a different planet. I'm just appalled. I'm not even going to talk about the sex scenes which were tantamount to rape sessions. I'm just so disappointed."
3,"Would have been great, but it was bent","It is larger than I was expecting, but that's good. One side was crushed in some and I was able to bend it back out partially but now that side still isn't smooth. I have that side facing the wall, and it matches the pencil holder nicely. I am still glad I bought it."
5,Very nice,"I bought this to put on the desk in my office. I had some other black mesh items (pencil holder, paper holder, etc) that are made by a different company and this matched them perfectly. It seems to be of good quality and is a little bigger than I thought it would be, which is a plus because I go through paperclips like crazy and this holds a lot more than I had thought."
1,Garbage,"First off what is garbage? Something you use for about two hours and then toss it in the trash can. So is there a difference between garbage and trash. Yes..............trash lasts longer before you toss it in the can. Good thing Common exposed this [....] But hey, at least he has one good thing going for him by snatching up the sexy T-Boz from TLC but that is ALL hehas going for him. Put it like this .....A three year old could make a better album. Stay Away...............Far Away."
2,Continual Slide,"Mack 10 seems to have lost it. Like Ice Cube with War and Peace, he tries to sound hard with an edge but you can tell he's trying too hard. He seems to have lost his hunger along with Ice Cube after the Westside Connection album. This is probably 10's worst album has he continues to fall. WC's the only hope for the old Westside Connection. Mack 10's gangsta believability is very very questionable after putting out a pretty lousy album here."
2,Strengths and amazing weaknesses,"MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!While Re-Cycle is visually impressive and overall very unique, the movie is crippled by it's terrible screenplay. Weak dialogue or thin characters I can ignore, but the plot of this movie, basically, is that a woman is pulled into a haunted world of lost souls and other miserable creatures by the ghost of her aborted pregnancy who wants to instill guilt, pain, and, most importantly, ask why.Really?The pro-life vibes of this movie are obnoxious and undisguised, so step carefully. While I really appreciated the look and feel of the movie, especially some super imaginative concepts and designs, I couldn't stomach the underlying plot."
1,The writing is SOOOOO BAD!,"Ugh! I can't take it. People don't pick up the phone and listen into it. They answer with ""Hello?"" or ""Wei?"" immediately. When people see something startling the don't ever so slowly start to look at it slowly turning their head over 20 seconds. If it's surprising they jump or shreek, if it's not so surprising thye inspect it immediately. Slow zooms with unrelated scary noises. A few more unbelievable parts later I just turned it off."
2,"Spectacular Visuals, but.....","Ting Yin is writing a new book about the supernatural called RECYCLE. As she begins writing, the world of RECYCLE starts to come alive, and as she journeys from the real world into this decaying reality where what we abandon goes, she sees many incredible and disturbing sights.It's ambitious, but it just doesn't work. This film can't seem to decide whether to scare or amaze, and though it does the latter very well in several scenes (the alleyway filled with amusement park rides was breathtaking) it doesn't save it from embarrassments like the cave of abandoned fetuses, or the cheap looking zombie hoards... cringeworthy! And even when the visuals are high quality and evocative, the synthesized score overpowers any quiet eeriness they're trying to convey and makes the action seem cheesy and comic.If this film had been shorter, had less (or just NO) dialogue, and a better score, it would've made a nice art movie."
2,Way to slow and confusing,"The DVD jacket, the Product Description provided by Amazon Instant Videos and the trailer really fooled me. I wanted Horror and didn't get it with this video. It was so slow, I never did figure out what the point was and was never scared. Ting Yin somehow opens up the door of the supernatural guided by one of her book's phantasmagorical creations and when it came to life, it was not terrifying at all. I had to ask, what did those ""things"" have to do with her book/life? I felt it would have been better if I saw more scenes of her writing the book while experiencing more supernatural incidents before it comes to life. And who is Miss Chu Xun and that other writer? And why couldn't she recognize her grandpa until the end? Angelica Lee is a very good actor and her young supporting actor had good chemistry together; that is what kept me until the end, but I would not recommend this."
3,Could have been great.,"The picture, acting, and special effects were all fantastic. The story line was just OK. I get the concept of the move but I just couldnt relate to it. There were a couple of jumpy parts but nothing spectacular. I didnt like the ending in the least, it didnt really make sense. I get it...but it still didnt make sense."
4,"strange, but good!","The Pang brothers have a certain way of showing a ghost that is truly creepy. The concept of the movie is unique and I can appreciate that. The actual story kinda jumps around and is a bit random, but for me it worked because I kept watching to see where it was going next. But its basically about a writer and shes working on her next book but cant come up with any ideas. Then all of a sudden shes actually in this world of a all her forgotten ideas. This world is constantly changing, like it goes through cycles and she cant be in a spot when its changing. So she has to keep going to find a way out.This Blu Ray does not have the best image quality I've seen, but it still looks amazing on an HDTV.If you like the Pang brothers, If you like strange movies that require a bit of imagination, or if you like creepy ghost movies, then you might enjoy this film"
2,"Overhyped, overlong","It starts out with promise, but the latter two-thirds are too slow and too long. This is especially evident in the scene where the heroine must part ways with her child guide - it's probably four times longer than it has to be. After the halfway mark I was tired of it, not really caring what came next. Warning: if you're a certain type of liberal you will HATE one of the messages of this movie. I wish I could recommend it to everyone for just this reason, but alas."
1,Boring,"I viewed this movie based on the good reviews. Basically it brings me back to what I've always believed, the majority of people have no way of discerning what is utter tripe and what is actually good or at the very least, interesting. So what if the visuals are fairly well done, the story is unbelievably bad and obvious. Why is is so hard these days to get a decent and well written story? Why do we almost always have to sacrifice story for visuals?I like to take chances on movies to find those very few gems out there. Unfortunately that means trawling through a whole bunch of lemons like this one on the journey. Steer clear!!"
3,Huge disappointment,"Visually stunning. Technically precise. Plot-wise, and in terms of an immersive story, I felt left out, cheated, and unimpressed. It was as if the trailer did a great job of highlighting everything gripping about the film."
3,A free RE-CYCLED version of BONES OF THE MOON,"I like this movie, but is a real Recycled from a Jonathan Carroll's novel: BONES OF THE MOON. The idea and the world are terrible similar. Read the book and compare. The movie is a real Re-cycled... but the novel is the best."
2,"Disjointed story, nonsensical ending","I give it two stars, for the effects which were quite striking at times. Overall though this movie had a pretty transparent story, with plot holes and inconsistencies. The little girl was the biggest one, and the one that broke the camel's back, so to speak. Every person in the 'other' world was essentially zombie/ghoul like, yet the little girl is not. This is purely to further the films ""message"". Even if you accept that the whole thing is just a guilt-trip inside the main character's head it still is not ultimately that satisfying since it is so disjointed. Unfortunately it just dragged at the end and nothing came as a surprise."
4,"Great movie, bit of a weak ending","Great special effects, beautiful actress and great story. The very end of the movie was a bit of a letdown but other than that the movie is well worth watching."
2,"Nice size, doesn't sparkle","I asked for this ring for my birthday because my friend has the same design and its gorgeous on her. When it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The sizes of the stones were fine, a little on the small side, but the imperfections were obvious even to my untrained eye. The most disappointing thing was that it just didn't sparkle even in the sunlight. I was wearing a diamond band from Costco and it sparkles beautifully. There was an article on CNN about the differences between purchasing diamonds from Costco & Tiffany's and the conclusion was that you do get quality diamonds from Costco and its well worth it. At least with Costco, you can see the diamonds before hand. I love Amazon but I strongly don't recommend it for jewels. You just don't know what you're getting no matter how many reviews you read."
2,Does not come in wide!,"The size lists wide, but trust me, if your feet are truly wide, then this shoe will not fit you. Other lifestride shoes may fit, but this one will not."
5,"A New Addition to the ""Favorites"" List","I grabbed this book from our library and was caught off guard by how hilarious it was. Halfway through I had to stop reading because we were laughing so hard. I particularly like the way it encouraged my kids to think about everyday experiences differently. It offered a great opportunity for teaching the difficult concepts of perspective and subjectivity in a fun and unique way.Kyle, age 7: This book was really interesting and I actually really loved it because it wasn't people, it was aliens and it was funny. The aliens called the babies earthlets and I really liked it and it was pretty cool.Ryan, age 7: It was humorous and exciting. My favorite part was how the father earthling throws the earthlet up into the atmosphere to make it stop crying."
3,Earthlets was really funny.,"If you like funny books this is the book for you.The story begins with an alien talking about earthlets, which are really babies. He doesn't understand what he's talking about, so she makes it up.She compares them to herself. But she talks about it in a funny way.She said what they winter were they get it. What you should not do and she jokes about it. Like don't drop them or put food in their ear and it's really funny and there's a sheep in the background and the next page has the sheep with no wool.Her class in training but after there done with class they go to earth dressed up the same."
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","There were parts of this book that were really good, and parts that were ""ho-hum"" predictable. The first chapters were gripping, then it settled into lust at first-sight, he's too good (rich) for her, so how do we figure out and solve the problems so they can be together?? I guess I was hoping for consistently interesting and it fell short."
5,A truly enjoyable read!,"What a truly enjoyable read!You will not be disappointed once you meet the two important characters in the story. You will empathize with Simon and Christine because of their background, their wants, needs and most importantly their flaws. The dialogues are not too melodramatic, just right and some lines just made me laughed out loud. I am more of a reader than a writer but I am giving my review because I believe the book deserves it and it just a nice book to read. I found myself not letting my Kindle go until I finished the story.Spoiler: ""Dizzy can go hang"""
3,yudenka,"I like the book, even though the end was predictable. The main thing, that I was't happy about is the age confusion. At the beginning of the book, it was told that Simon was a man of forty three. Christine was nineteen, so Simon was old enough to be her Dad. Somewhere in the middle of the book, Simon had his birthday and he was turning thirty five. I think, that is something, that the editor should have noticed. Other that this little detail, I liked the book, especially Margo."
2,never buy anything that costs this much online!,"my husband has been owning his for months now. at first he loved it. till about two weeks ago, water has got into the inside of it. now it has water bubbles on the surface of the glass from the inside. you have to look closer to get a good look at the time. waste of money."
4,indispensable guide for all breeds and all problems,"This text helps you identify your dogs personality type and then work on specific problems according to his/her needs. This book emphasizes reconditioning as well as introductory training. It makes use of various tools such as the choke collar, shake can, and lead. I have had good success with this book with cocker spaniels to great danes. I have had timid to aggressive dogs. These tips for reconditioning focus on on-lead techniques but not exclusively. The topics in this book that I have used are: housebreaking, barking, biting, fence fighting, and carpography. This text is the one that I refer to over and over again throughout my dogs lives. When you have 3 great danes that are siblings raised entirely without a mother to guide them, you need help to guide you and this book has it all."
1,Wine fridge stopped working,"7 months from purchase date, my Emerson 8 bottle countertop wine fridge stopped working. No support from company. This is the FIRST online review I have ever written. (this is how ticked off I am). Steer clear of this item and company!!!!!"
1,Emerson FR24SL WASTE of $$$,"Wish we had read the reviews FIRST. As others have written, in less than one year, it quit cooling properly - sometimes not cooling at all. I contacted the company to find out how to get it repaired or replaced; will cost more to package and ship than we paid for it... so essentially, NO WARRANTY. We will be shopping for a more reliable brand!"
1,Don't buy,"A little after one year of use (just in time for the warranty to expire) the unit almost completely stopped cooling. It is set at 55 degrees and the temperature readout says it is at 65 degrees, ten below room temperature, but I don't even think it's that cool. Save your money."
1,poor investment,Following little more than 1-year of service this unit stopped cooling. Even when working was not very efficient and will not accept very tall wine bottles. Other than 1-year warranty can find no information on part or repair options.
1,junk,I got this wine frig for Christmas last year. It stopped cooling a few months ago and completely went out last week. Do not buy this product! It's junk
1,Doesn't last very long,"I ended up going through two of these units within 3 years. The first one died in 4 months, wouldn't cool at all. The second one made it almost 3 years, with regular cleaning every 6 months (fans, vents, etc- filter monthly). I feel that it should have lasted at leat 6 years. Never buying emerson again- you should look for something else and save your troubles."
1,Leaks water internally after 6 months of use.,"Very frustrated with this cooler. After only 6 months of use the cooler drips so much water inside the unit that it pours out onto the counter. Target won't return it, the company won't fix it. What a waste."
1,Piece of Junk!!,"Do not buy anything emerson!!! I received an Emerson wine cooler as a bridal shower gift in May because my husband lived in an apartment after we were married we did not have the space to put it anywhere. We moved about one year later and I was finally able to open the product and just under 3 months later it died!! I got on the internet and searched the product and it seems that everyone is having this problem. I called the company to see if they would do anything for me because I had only used it for 3 months!! The product did sit in the box for one year but that would be no different if it sat on the shelf at Target for 1 year. The customer service mangager at Emerson said all he could do was offer me an apology. I told him about the numerous reviews and complaints by consumers and he said they are all out of warranty so there is nothing they can do. Basically, this wine cooler is set up to die right after the warranty is up! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,A wine cooler that doesn't cool,Mine didn't last anywhere near a year. It had trouble maintaining 63 degree wine after just 5 months. Cleaned the filter behind the fan a couple of times and now 10 months after buying it the fan stopped turning. My wine is 94 degrees inside this cooler.Don't buy this piece of junk.
1,Do not buy,"I received this wine cooler as a gift and am extremely disappointed with the quality. It only worked for a few hours out of the box before the cooling stopped, and now it actually heats the wine bottles above room temperature. Save your money; I'll be sure never to buy any Emerson products in the future."
1,Wine Warmer,Wine cooler? - not so much. Like everyone else here mine just conked out after a little over a year and is currently warmer inside (a crisp 85 degrees) than the rest of my house is.
1,"Awful, horrible, made in China, junk...","I feel lucky mine lasted 2 years before crapping out. Awful, horrible piece of junk. I actually rapped on the back with my hand the fan started working for a short time. Am I supposed to call Fonzie to fix this? Then I saw the back: ""Made in China."" Nuff said."
1,Wine Heater not Cooler,"We received our wine cooler as a gift two years ago. Within a year we couldn't get it to maintain its target temperature. This weekend we found the temperature to be 92 degrees, about 30 degrees warmer than our house!! Completely ruining the wine inside the cooler. When I called Emerson costumer service they informed me that the warranty is only good for one year and without a receipt they couldn't do anything. The costumer service representative was not sympathetic or helpful in the least bit. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Disappointing performance; Fan stopped working after 2 years,"My husband and I received this wine cooler as a wedding present. Like the other reviews, after about a few years, the fan stopped working completely. We followed all of the installation instructions (the cooler was on our countertop, not next to any appliances, no objects within 5 inches of ventilation, plugged into it's own electrical socket)but still, the cooler stopped working.While I haven't contacted Emerson yet to potentially trouble shoot or obtain replacement parts, overall this wine cooler has been poorly manufactured and I would strongly advise against purchasing one."
5,movie,"jSuper great sam elliott movie, great quality picture and a well written movie, a western with hidden love story intertwined"
3,Good but not like the book,the movie was pretty good overall. . .but it lacked plot and character development. . .if you really want to get the whole story. . .read the book. . its great
2,The Quick and The Dead,"Sam Elliot has always been one of my modern day favorite Western actors.However, his portrayal of a drifter who has no problem with adultery is not worthy of him. This is not a family film.He was much more believable in ""Conagher"" and ""The Sacketts"".The film has an interesting story line, and portrays the dangers of travel in the old west very clearly. After watching this movie one can understand why staying with the wagon train was the wise thing to do."
2,All the stereotypes from the 1950s,"All the stereotypes are here from the 1950s western: the silent ""Injun"", the heroic mountain man (Sam Elliot), the honest and hardworking pioneer family, the greedy and sadistic bad guys. The dialog is also filled with hammy stilted lines that one would expect from that era. The simple black/white characterizations and trite sentimentality were difficult for me to watch. Sam Elliot is perfectly cast, and there are a few good scenery shots and a cohesive plot, so I gave it 2 stars. I might recommend this as a movie for kids except for the violence - there are at least 8 shootings and one severe clubbing. There is also lusting of the lowest kind by one of the outlaws towards the pioneer woman (hence the clubbing). If you are interested in an excellent modern western for adults with subtle dialog and characterizations (and plenty of violence), tryThe Propositionwith Guy Pearce."
4,Easy Movie to Enjoy - Over and over,"Although the movie theme is somewhat simple, when you want to relax, things should be simple. The scenery is great with a great cast. The 'bad guys' are fun to watch mess up. The waterfall scene is nice and you can tell that there is real feeling between the lead characters. Enjoy it."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this movie because I thought it would be like the movie version of Louis L'Amour's ""Conagher"". Unfortunately, it is a far cry from that movie. The Quick and the Dead was too predictable, the dialog was stilted and unrealistic, and the characters...well, they were too much ""in character"" and not believable. I am curious how faithful the script was to the book. If the movie is as faithful to the book as ""Conagher"" was, then I apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with Mr. L'Amour instead."
1,VHS really! come on it's 2012!,"Oh well I suppose I'll just put it on the shelf to give to someone who might still have a working VHS player! I purchased this in a hurry and assumed it was on Disc not Tape! My Bad! Hey does anyone have an 8-Track of Bread, This Isn't What the Govern meant!?!"
1,A real low for Sam Elliott,"Sam Elliott is one of my favorite western actors, but this is is a truly worthless and totally unredeeming film. I hope I can watch other Elliott pictures in the future without being reminded of this awful, creepy piece of trash, which I disposed of at it conclusion. I felt like I needed a shower after watching it."
3,quick and the dead,The movie started out good but it froze up alot so I didn't get to see the whole movie.
3,The Quick and the Derivative,"Ah, yes, the old indestructible stranger riding to help some greenhorns against a band of outlaws routine. This plot is old, and is only helped by Day's direction and Elliott's performance. On the other hand, the novel this is based on really was L'Amour's worst, so you will have to take this entire video experience with a grain of salt."
5,The Quick and the Dead,"I have watched and re-watched this movie many times since it orginally came out on HBO. I never tire of watching it. Sam Elliott is the Man!! Kate Capshaw and Tom Conti do a wonderful job as novice westerner's, along with the young man who plays their son. By the end, they are not novices anymore, thanks to Sam. Yes, its that good, and a LOT better than that crap movie by Gene Hackman with the same name."
4,"The Quick and the Dead, a great movie","Bought this video because it had subtitles, would like to have more westerns with subtitles. Great acting, good entertainment, Like I stated nothing like a old western, good history lesson."
4,"Texan, Quick and Dead","Not too bad, for an old western I'd never seen before. Also, never had seen 'Sam Elliot' before so will have to check out (review) a few more of his films. It's still nice to find an old film where the good guys are good and decent, and beat the bad guys."
3,Good movie but beware of fake widescreen,"This is a very good made-for-HBO movie from 1987 that unfortunately has been matted down from its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio to a ""widescreen"" ratio for DVD. This results in a lot of incorrectly framed shots, tops of heads being cut off, etc. I would have preferred that it was presented in its original aspect ratio."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When the product was recieved i took it out of the box and it literally fell apart into a bunch of pieces. Then after i recived my new one i tested it out and it wouldnt cut the seatbelt to the old car seat i had what a dissapointment. Just thought id let you guys know how dissapointing this product is dont buy it.
1,Disappointing,I selected this as it was the closest to one that I was replacing after eight years. It did not meet any of my expectations and the company kindly gave me a refund after I returned the phone. Their service was excellent but the product was not.
1,VERY difficult to use / lots of errors!,"I bought this MFC-8840D and installed software on one computer only to find out that the PC-FAX software does NOT work. You will have to use your Windows based FAX software with this. The scanner and copier work fine, and this works as a stand alone product fairly well. However, connect this to ANY computer running Windows and your troubleshooting fun begins.Brother's ONLY answer is to re-install and re-boot the computer endlessly. Unless you want to try and figure out how to use Windows based fax software... and good luck with that. This thing is a piece of junk and Brother does not have support to fix your software issues.Yes, I've been through all the documentation and logged multiple hours and calls to Brother's support line. They know me well.Find a better ALL in ONE choice!!! This ain't it!!!"
4,Really enjoy my printer,"I have had this printer for years and years. It is fast and seldom jams. The few times it has jamed it is b/c I tried to force too much in the manual feed or something. I really love this printer. It is huge, but, I just don't care. It is so reliable, fast, and I can get a refurb toner cartidge cheap that last forever. I will never go back to ink."
4,Not too shabby,"I spent a good 6 hours on-line reviewing multifunction units before I purchased this one in 12/05. I have never used the scanner, so I don't know if this function works well or not, which is why I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5. I have used the unit for 2 months with no complaints from any of my staff, or from me.I needed something that would do the job all the time with no hassles. This unit fills the spot. The only time it has ever actually jammed is when I tried using very cheap, low weight copy paper.Pros: Fast, reliable, toner cartridge is re-fillable through online sources. Toner not too expensive.Fits into the small space I have in my office.Cons: Be sure it is NOT plugged into a battery back-up when you turn it on, because it sucks a lot of power at start-up and will knock-out the back-up system. (I just plug mine into the wall, the old fashioned way, to avoid this)Bottom line: My opinion.. you won't find a better product for the price."
2,Paper curls,"I had a Brother 9600 printer. So when it broke, I bought the 8840D expecting the same features and satisfaction as the 9600. Since my office isn't air conditioned, I expected some slight curling as was the case with the 9600 but the 8840D was so much worse. Even 24lb laser paper wouldn't print more than a few copies without backing up. If you can stand the long wait, customer service is good. They sent a replacement drum and when that didn't work another printer. Neither stopped or reduced the curling to a tolerable level. I regret having to return this printer since it has so many other good qualities."
1,Awful,"This book was just awful. I mean I don't try to be overly p.c. but come on, Mulatto. I think Cameron should have been ashamed of herself for trying to pass as white and denying who she really was. And to make matters worse she still wanted to be part of a sorority that was clearly rascist. Does she really think someone who uses the n-word and is prejudice would ever accept her as a 'sister'. I think she was a weak character who didn't have the backbone to stand up for what she was. If you plan on getting this book. Don't! It's awful."
5,good series; good book!,"Excellent. The most realistic books about college for young adults you'll find on the shelf today. However, it is supposed to be discountined, and that is really too bad. Because this is a great series! Great! Cameron is a good charcter, and it's sad how her own grand parents didn't want to see her because she was mulatto (half white-half black). But a good book none the less. Although, I thought that it was a little extreme with Tad and Cameron wanting to sleep toghter on the first date. But that's college life."
1,unengaging,"It takes a lot of tallent to make Dr. Seuss boring. The makers of this DVD somehow managed. There are lots of videos from the 1960s and 70s that have fully animated musical adaptations of Dr. Seuss stories with scripts and lyrics by Ted Geisel himself. My daughter loves them. Actually, so do I. This one, however, was so unappealing we both wanted to turn it off."
2,"Pale Imitation, Stick to the Original","As a fan of the original movie Bachelor Mother starring Ginger Rogers I recognized that Bundle of Joy was a remake within a minute of watching this film when I came across it on TCM. I hadn't realized there was a remake of the original black and white version, and since I like Debbie Reynolds and am typically a fan of musicals I decided to watch. I was very disappointed. The acting was inferior across the board from the Ginger Rogers version. Due to poor pacing and lackluster performances, Bundle of Joy couldn't inspire a laugh. It was a real dud compared to the comic romp of Bachelor Mother. Save your time and watch the original version."
2,A not so funny musical comedy,"This movie aired recently on TCM. It was a remake of Bachelor Mother which starred Ginger Rogers. Bachelor Mother was considerably better than this dud.Basically the script is quite poor and not very funny. Eddie Fisher, while possesing a nice voice, just doesn't cut it as an actor. Debbie Reynolds does her usual good job but she simply can't carry this movie out of its mediocrity.I feel I was quite generous in giving this movie two stars."
5,Great movie!!,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas since she and I had grown up watching it during the holidays. It is by far (at least on my list) a great musical comedy. At the time of making this movie, Debbie Reynolds was carrying Carrie Fisher. Once you know that and see the dance scene, it shows what a trooper Ms. Reynolds is. This is a remake of the Bundle of Joy originally staring Ginger Rogers and David Niven. This new one is definitely better especially with Eddie Fisher kicking it off with a great song. A must see during the holidays."
5,Great Flick,"This is my wife's favorite New Years movie. We watch it every year. It is a clever romantic comedy, especially if you like good movies from the Carry Grant era."
4,We loved it!,"I bought this video from Amazon to share with my granddaughter. I wanted her to see the gentle, up-lifting stories that I enjoyed as a young person. I also told her of the damage done to a nice little family when EF broke up his home to be with LT. Life has changed, some good but not always in favor of children. This story was a nice little trip back to the good times."
4,A Standard,This movie is a Holiday Classic. I have watched this movie every Christmas since I was a little girl. I was thrilled to get it Remastered in a DVD. It is a comedy set in a Department store during the Holiday season. Eddie Fisher & Debbie Reynolds are at their best. The story revolves around an abandoned baby left on the steps of an Orphanage. A wonderful Romantic comedy.
1,What the hell was this?!,"I haven't listened to this song for about 3 years, but i still remember how BAD it was! i CAN'T believe it was a single. Obviously a desperate attempt to make her out to be a pop artist since her rock days were LONG GONE! Sheesh!"
3,DON'T DRY IN THE DRYER,"While this hamper is very cute, matches the crib set perfectly and is suprisingly sturdy... I followed the washing instructions to a T and the fabric shrank. It says to tumble dry low... I would suggest hang drying it. While it still fits on the frame, it's hard to get on and is very tight. I considered returning it, but it's still functional."
3,Hmm.....,"I ordered many items from this theme and I was really impressed. This hamper however, while it matched the theme, was not the color as advertised. The hamper is more of a cream color, rather than the vibrant yellow color that I expected. Other than that, I like it a lot."
2,disappointed because it broke.,"This hamper coordinates well with the room decor, and I love the Jungle Babies theme. However, we were very disappointed in the quality. After 5 months of use, my nanny picked up the laundry hamper to move it to another corner of the nursery and it simply broke. Upon inspection, the wood was very cheap and it is only glued together. It may have come unglued because we, like many parents, are running a humidifier in our son's room. I cannot speculate. All I know is that I went out and got a better hamper from a local discount store for half the price. It doesn't offer the cute designs of this hamper, but it's the sort of thing that I can pick up and throw around and not worry about it falling apart, let alone just moving it across the room."
2,"I matches, is pretty, but cheap made","I ordered this hamper because it matches my daughter's room decor, but I was very dissapointed by the quality of the wood. It is not very sturdy. I looks cheap. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
5,Love it!,"I am very pleased with this toy. Someone got me one for Valentine's Day and I play with it for hours on end! Although it doesn't teach you much, it is very fun and durable!"
2,lusitania,"I HAD THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THIS WOULD BE ABOUT THE STORY OF THE SHIPWRECK AND THE RECENT DIVES. UNFORTUNATELY I GOT NEITHER FROM THE BOOK. IT IS REALLY THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR. THAT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT DO NOT TRY AND DISGUISE IT AS A BOOK ABOUT THE LUSITANIA."
2,The Suddenly Susan of the HBO lineup.,"The title of this Arli$$ release seems to indicate that it is the first of a series of ""best of"" DVDs. The surprising thing, however, is that I was unaware there was enough ""best of"" material to even fill a single DVD, let alone a set of them!The longevity of Arli$$ is inexplicable, just as it was unbelievable that Suddenly Susan ran for so long in NBC's coveted Thursday night lineup. Everything here is stale, from the hackneyed storylines, to the obvious Jerry Maguire overtones that may have been relevant in 1996, but have long since overstayed their welcome.Save your $$. This show ain't worth it."
1,by far one of the worst shows ever id give minus 5,"This was one of the first original shows that hbo came out with and their biggest mistake. Its only put out as a best of on 2 discs. Thats horrible. Its not funny, bad acting, the only thing that makes this show even watchable is the sports stars. If you get a chance watch mad tv they made fun of this dvd set on a sketch, now thats hillarious. If you are still interested in buying this set i believe it is sold at finer car washes near you, usually free with a $10 wash"
5,This is great stuff!,"Yes, I know...many snobby critics and magazines, along with SNL trashed this show over the years, but it was laugh-out-loud funny more often than not. Robert Wuhl created a memorable character, with great support from Sandra Oh and Jim Turner. The athletes (in their cameos) proved without a doubt they are not actors, but that was half the fun....watching them struggle!A few of these episodes deserved to be award winners, and guests like Ed Asner and Ken Howard are at their best.Thanks HBO for seven great seasons....longer than many critics' careers!"
5,my husband loves it,Brought this as a gift from my 2 yr old to his dad for his bday. The man loved it! The price was right and the shipping was fast. My husband has always been an Arliss fan. Going back watching these shows really made his day.
5,Really miss this show,Unfortunately I became aware of Arliss maybe the second to last year of its run. Really enjoy this collection of some episodes that I saw and many that I hadn't.
3,"Great Show, Bad DVD...","Arli$$ is a very funny, very clever show that deserves better treatment than that it was given on this DVD.13 Episodes from it's 7 Seasons? Please!Complete Season Sets only, thank you HBO, complete Season Sets only."
3,Good but interesting choices,"I was a huge fan of the show when it aired on HBO Sunday Nights; however I find the ""Best of"" choices to be quite interesting. There were many other episodes that were much better than the ones presented in this set. Where was the episode where Kirby must outdrink the Volleyball player? or the Battle in the Big ouse boxing match or the one with the Katarina Witt orsome of the other classics. Instead we are treated to episodes that make one yawn. Next time let's see more humorouse episodes."
4,Cute Christmas decoration,"I bought this for my brother without knowing much about it. It has three different penguins that sing ""We wish you a Merry Christmas."" Each penguin has a different voice, and each bobs up and down when it is its turn to sing. It is very cute, but they only sing the one song in the same way every time.The penguins are well made and detailed, but I don't know how durable it is. It should be used as a decoration, rather than a toy."
4,"Finding a Mentor, Being a Mentor","This is a good book for someone who is becoming a mentor to another Christian woman. The book takes you on your own journey of prayer to mentor another and then looks at what you may want to share at each meeting you have with the woman you mentor. If you are looking for a book to help you with this process, I recomend this one. It is very helpful."
5,Be a better mentor,"I gave this book to my daughter who works as ayouth ministry assistant. In her position, she isoften looked upon as a mentor by the young girls sheworks with. She also looks for women of God to mentorto her. This book was tremendously helpful to her inboth."
3,Copper Plumbers tape is usefull,I find it hard to believe that this roll is only 7.44 inches long. Perhaps they mean 7.44 FEET long ? That is more believable. But still expensive. This stuff is incredibly useful for all sort of DIY projects . Kinda the duck tape of the turn of the century. Get sum.
3,oh well,I ordered two thinking it was two batteries but it was two five packs hope they last a long time
1,Viguen Memory - VERY poor,"This video repeats the same few clips over and over. The retrospect at the end commenting about the late artist is lazy, poor and not all informative. After paying for this hack job DVD I feel robbed. It really is an unfair look back at the man and the music."
5,Great movie for new big brothers or sisters,"Even though I could see this episode on tv for free, I bought it after my 3 year old was born when my other kids were having trouble adjusting. I'm glad I did! They love it!"
5,Hypnotic,"Appogee's underground flavor takes you beyond the limits of space and time. Mixing intricate modern beats with electronic artistry, each song seeps into your skin with deft harmony. Enchanting low-key lyrics not only set the mood but create the entire hypnotic atmosphere itself. The tracks take hold of you as you ride along each melodic twist and turn. Appogee dares to experiment with ethereal yet incredibly down to earth rhythms in ten amazing electronic syntheses."
1,Multicultural Video,"This is a video that celebrates America's multiculturalism. There are many scenes of dancing and singing children, many in thier native costumes from their native lands, but very little in the way of America's classic patriotic songs. The advertising is a little misleading. If you are looking for a video with rousing American patriotic songs, you will be disappointed."
4,American Education for all American students,"This DVD is performed largely by students. It includes lots of information about imigration and American history. Some of the music is quite good, some is not quite so professional sounding, but it's all touching. The videography is very good. I would recommend this DVD for teachers."
3,If you like historical fiction,"OK book, but not nearly as interesting as Morrow's later offerings. It just isn't holding my interest, but it's a fair read."
1,Had potential but didn't hold my interest long enough,"As a child, I loved The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This book starts out from a teenager's point of view, leading me to expect something of the same, and it had my full attention. Then it switched to the father's point of view, and after a while I just stopped caring about these characters (the father seemed particularly weak). It was difficult to follow anyone's motivation, and the sex scenes seemed incongruous to the way the book started out (a young girl's voice). The concept was strong, but perhaps the author was too ambitious in scope."
4,A New Twist on the Same Ole Witch Story,"I really enjoyed this book. Even though it followed a similar narrative to say, any other novels written about the Salem Witch trials, it held my attention. I thought the pace of the story was good and that the overall writing style was vey good as well.I think anyone who enjoys a good suspense story with a little historical relevance thrown in will enjoy this novel."
2,Not well written.,"Sorry, I did not enjoy this book. I did not think it was welll written and nor were the characters fully developed. The entire book was like reading one big dialogue. If you are looking for a book to learn more about the Salem Witch Trials, I don't recommend this one. I am going to try a nonfiction book instead."
4,Entertaining and Uplifting,"Loved reading the father's musings and revelations. This is uplifting, inspirational as well as entertaining. The ""hand writing"" is sometimes challenging to read though."
5,Feasting and Celebrating,"What a wonderful compilation by Jan Karon, one of my favorite authors. The book is inspiring and alsoshows a little more of what Father Tim was thinking and believing. Choose this book to send to a shut-inyou know ---it will help the person feel better...more hopeful, and comforted. It also draws one to understandmore about God and what He desires of us as His children. Well put together, I am enjoying this book."
5,The Feast Doth Continue!,"Volume Two of Father Tim's ""quote book."" A further collection of his thoughts & musings. It is just delightful reading, and a great ""short cut"" to some really great quotes. Another home run by Jan Karon."
1,Let the Buyer Beware,"Having read and enjoyed all of the Mitford Books, I ordered this one, together with Patches of Godlight. Imagine my surprise when i discovered that instead of being printed in a readable form, both of these books contain mostly ""handwritten"" writing. They are printed in a barely legible script longhand, complete with misspellings. This may be a cute and clever way to present what are called Father Tim's favorite quotations, but, for me, they were hard to read and a big disappointment. I wish they had been printed rather than presented in this manner."
3,Good movie ruined by a bad ending,"It beat my expectations I can say that much. Actually I thought it was really good while I was watching it, I was very interested in the story line and how it would end. BUT unfortunately they go ahead and ruin it with basically no ending. You are left with too many questions. It just leaves you hanging, which would be fine if they were planning on making a sequel, but we know thats not happening. So I have it at 3 stars, I took a star off because of the ending."
4,"nifty film that tries too hard, but is still interesting","This film has to have one of the most irritating beginning. IT plays a about two minutes and credits break in. Well some films do that. But this KEEPS doing that. Once it finally gets past that, you have a nice small film, but it tries to tell you it's a smart film, no show you. It's well acted with Ian McShane as a police inspector, with a daughter in school named Sara. Sara plays games with a video store owner, Highlander's Adrian Paul. But then someone ups the stakes of their games...The abrupt ending hurt the film, but all in all a very enjoyable effort - and hey, I would watch anything with McShane in it!!"
2,yawnnnnn is there meaning to it all,just finished watching this movie in itself its a decent thriller and adrian paul for a change doesnt play the good guy what is the meaning behind all the unexplained bad events in the world who knows but it isnt this i guess we could blame the devil and old fashioned idea and concept its as good as reason as any and much better than the mumbo jumbo in this flick worth watching once but if u are going to buy buy it on the cheap not new
3,Adrian Paul,I'm interested in Adrian Paul. He's not even mentioned in the credits. Would anyone recommend this movie for his performance?
2,Very poor.,"Stupid movie. Poorly edited, dumb plot, very dark sets, not even remotely entertaining. The basic idea had some potential but it did not come together. A waste of money. I'm an Adrian Paul fan but this made it all the more disappointing."
3,Anything With Ian McShane,"I'm a rabid Ian McShane fan and I watch any and everything with him in it. As far as Nemesis Game is concerned, Ian is good, he looks great and I wish he had a bigger role. I don't care about anything else in regards to this movie---just Ian McShane."
2,Handwriting Analysis Is Bunk!,"The only reason anyone would consider learning Graphology is for an evening of entertaiment with friends. Graphology, handwriting analysis, pen stroke analysis ( or what you want to call this )has never been scientifically proven or validated and never will."
4,Enjoyable,"Once I started reading this book I couldn't put this book down. At times the lead character, Stacy Killian, annoyed me; it wasn't bad enough to ruin the story. The identity of the killer was a real surprise since I did not guess the killer. This book was enjoyable."
3,Mystery thriller with great twists,"I won this book as a door prize at a League of Writers local chapter meeting. I don't read much murder/suspense (mostly Carol Higgins Clark when I do or John Grisham) and I decided to give this one a try. It hooked me with the characters, but I was disappointed in the heroine's inability to control her emotions regarding previous trauma. Maybe this helped fuel the plot, but I could not get into her mind because of the barriers of her ""in-denial"" personality. If that is what the writer wanted to display to the reader, she did it well. The after-morning sex scene I felt was out of place in this otherwise fast-paced mystery. Readers who want more graphic bedroom descriptions should read other authors. I read it for a mystery and was displeased with the bedroom scene being thrown in as if ""everyone does it."" I agree with another reviewer that the ending seemed to wind up quickly. No book is perfect and this one was entertaining, even with all my complaints."
4,Great Read!,Great characters and story. I liked that it kept me guessing until the very end! Will read more of her books.
2,Killer Takes All,"This is the first book I have read by Erica Spindler. I thought her writing style was fine, but I found myself becoming bored with the ""game playing"" aspect of the novel. I have never played ""role playing"" games, and I have no interest in them. I didn't realize just how much of the story would be about ""the game"" based on Alice In Wonderland characters. Midway through the book I was reading frantically, not because I was enjoying it, but because I wanted to finish it so I could read something else! I may try another novel by Erica Spindler, but I will read about the plot a lot more carefully before I purchase!"
5,Kill really does Take All,"I thought this book was great. I'm not big into gaming, but if you know anything about it you will be hooked into this storyline. It was very well written. Many twists and turn that kept me interested. It was such a different plot line than other detective-type stories and that's what really kept me going with it. I would highly recommend it, although this is the first of her novel's I have read I'm currently looking for other good titles."
1,Erica comes up without a full deck.,"I found the book, which promised an interesting premise to be incredibly dry. It didn't evoke any sort of terror, or shock like some of her earlier work (Namely Shocking Pink). I knew exactly who the killer was from the point of introduction. This Book just didn't do it for me."
3,Huh?,"While Killer Takes All was a well written suspense novel, I was amazed at some of the characters in the novel. The setting was in New Orleans and much of it centered on the NOPD. The nagging question is, ""where were all the people of color."" With the exception of an overweight secretary mentioned earlier in the book, there was no mention of any black characters and I am still in a bit of shock. When I read this book, you would think that the setting was in some remote village in Minnesota or Wisconsin, not NO. The storyline itself was good but I was a bit disappointed in the lack of diversity in this book. I guess some of us simply do not belong in Ms Spindler's little club. :( I don't think I'll read Ms. Spindler's books again."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"This book is readable, but I wouldn't recommend this book to someone looking for romantic suspense. First of all, there is very little romance in this book. The ""romance"" between the two main characters is barely touched upon -- there isn't even a love scene between them! Just a ""morning after"" scene, which I found highly disappointing.Secondly, the plot in this book is remarkably complicated and involves five major plot twists in the last 100 pages (I'm not kidding here). I don't mind a suspense novel with a good twist or two, but I think too many twists hurt a story's credibility. I also found it difficult to keep track of all the different characters in the story as well.Spindler is a good writer and writes in a fluid style. I'm willing to give her writing another shot, but I would suggest passing on this one."
5,"BRILLIANT, HER BEST WORK YET!","This is by far her best work yet. I have been an Erica Spindler fan for a long time, it seems she just gets better and better. She is quickly moving up in the ranks as one of the best suspense writers to date."
3,"good, not quite 5 stars","I am a first reader for Erica Spindler. I really got into this book, read it in a matter of hours. I am an avid Dean Koontz reader, and I would say that this book flows like his writing. I was really disappointed by how it ended though. It didn't leave me satisfied with the outcome. Sorry, Erica. I tried."
3,Killer Takes All,"Disturbed by a noise in the still of the night, Stacy Killian wakes to find two dear friends brutally murdered. The former cop's instincts are instantly on alert, but even with all her training, she has no idea how deep a rabbit hole she's falling down. The two women are only the first victims of a mysterious Game Master known as the White Rabbit. Unlike most D and D variants, this game was one where losing meant you died in fact. Now, as each card is dealt, another unwilling player dies. Picking up skills she thought left behind, Stacy must work with the two cops assigned to the case to win this deadly game.*** Fascinating suspense leaps off the first page and does not let up until the last. Drawing on familiar images turned horrific, Ms. Spindler weaves a spell of terror around her reader, proving once more that she is a master of her game. ***"
2,Not the best.,"The humor in this book isn't the cute almost innocent humor of the first two. This book has a different and much more adult oriented plot line. However, it still has it's funny moments and is enjoyable. Be warned though: Not as good as the first two."
5,Pedro the Lion The Only Reason...,"Pedro the Lion, you can listen to his thoughts via music any time any where. It's like he's talking to you but over guitar."
5,I've never been so moved by a band,"In typical Pedro fashion, the lyrics are heart breaking. The music, although simple, is beautiful. David Bazan is one of the most talented writers I've ever heard."
5,Very secure,"This album may be my favorite Pedro album, even though it is an EP. What is so great about this album, as well as pretty much all their albums, is the diverstiy. They dont tire out one style of song, which is true even with this short EP. There are slow songs and faster songs, i mean, one must keep in mind that this is a rather downbeat band, but regardless, they do have more upbeat songs. I mean, compare ""big trucks"" to ""invention""-which is one of my favorite Pedro songs. The writing on it is as good as anything David Bazan has done, and yet, it sticks out to me for some reason. From beginning to end, there is not one bad track, or even mediocre track, it is all very solid, and flows as well as all their stuff. Emotionally, probably as strong or stronger than their most popular album ""Control."""
4,i like it,"i am really enjoying this book, but why did i pay over forty dollars for it!! when the back say 14.00 im going to buy one of the other diper free books to compare, i think the info could be given for less money"
2,Need more documentation,"The author writes accounts of potty training through personal experiences, but is a little bit too extreme. There wasn't enough documentation to prove her theories at all, and it wasn't a book that I had hoped for: a clear, cut-to-the-chase book on potty training. If users are really serious about potty training at an early age, a better book to read would be Linda Sonna's Early Start Potty Training. Linda Sonna presents theories and backs it up with numerous amounts of research that makes her points seem valid. Her method is straight forward on how to start potty training at various ages and answers the questions of accidents and mishaps."
4,Bauer's a little wacky,"But this is nevertheless a worthwhile read. Bauer is definitely the crunchiest of the three authors of early-potty-training/elimination communicating books. Boucke has more cross-cultural information. While I have not yet read Sonna, it looks like she has the most historical/research based information.Bauer spends a lot of time describing ways to increase the bond between mother (parent, caregiver . . .) and baby, including, obviously, natural infant hygiene/elimination communication, but also including baby wearing next to the skin and, in general, lots of skin to skin contact. She is, in her own quirky way, an inspiring mother."
5,interesting read,"This was a very interesting book to read. Wish I had this info with my first child, it might have made it easier to attempt rather than starting new with a 2 year old in tow. This is a great book for new mothers who are looking into diapering alternatives. Over all the book was in great condition so I gave it 5 stars."
1,Not for mother's with anything else to do...,"I am a mother of 4 children. I work part-time at a job and full-time at home. This book just did not offer ANY help for someone in my situation, and I don't know anyone in my city that could benefit. You'd have to be able to stare at your child at least 12 hours a day. I already knew how to potty train, but I had hoped for some more insight and new ideas to help the process along - but this book did not deliver. I'm using the training underpants with plastic covers and taking my little one to the potty regularly. I offer special stickers for successful use of the potty and hopefully he will soon be able to prompt me when he needs to go..."
5,Historical Review to How to Elimination Communication,"This is not a potty training book. Diaper Free! The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene is about Elimination Communication, as well as a book that emphasizes a tuned in form of parenting. This book is not about learning to bend the child's will. Instead, this book is about working to form lines of communication. The premise is that infants are aware of their bodily functions and that they can communicate the need to go to the potty.The author covers the topic very well. She includes chapters on historical and cultural differences in how parents have chosen to deal with their infants elimination needs. Also, included are chapters that explain experiences, instruction, variances, and just about anything you can think of related to this topic."
5,can't do without it,"i read this book while pregnant and was a little blown away, wondering if i could do it. the day i got a tiny potty in the mail, i set my 6 week old daughter on it and she peed! as if it was nothing new! she is nearly 5 months old now and we never buy diapers. our friends and family are amazed. it is an essential to share with new parents.we are so proud of our daughter, and i am so grateful to this author -Gentle Wisdom is very appropriate."
1,Like plaster..,"This has to be the worst I have used. It smells horrible and it is thick and very paste like. I will use it for the beach, nothing else."
2,A better choice would be...,"I was disappointed with this DVD. It reminded me of a home video. Choppy editing, variable volume. Most of the time was spent on an interview with General Choi Hong Hi, founder of taekwon-do. I had a hard time understanding it without subtitles and the interviewer clearly didn't understand what General Choi was saying, either. It was embarrassing to watch. I enjoyed seeing some of the patterns performed back in the 1960s, but if that's what you're looking for, a better choice would be the 4 disc CD-ROM set Legacy: Taekwon-do Multimedia Encyclopedia. It includes interviews with the General, all 24 patterns, the entire 15 volume Taekwon-do Encyclopedia, and 200 Korean words related to taekwon-do. Highly valuable for any student.Bottom line is, I was hoping this DVD would make a nice addition to my small collection, but I'm considering donating it to the public library."
3,Has its moments,"Rare footage of the early masters, worth it. Gen. Choi interview is really hard to follow, they should include subtitles. I liked Gen Choi's morning workout, he was in incledible shape for his age. On the end, Master Park's moves are great, there is a master doing some great Ho Shin Sul too."
1,Not so much,"Even a blind squirrel will find a nut if it keeps digging. That's the way it is with this DVD - every now and then she stumbles on a useful move. This DVD is not for anyone who has taken more than one or two floorwork classes or workshops, nor for any dancers who value isolation. I don't know why she calls something a chest circle if her hips are moving all over the place. Very disappointing."
3,Salt & Pepper/One More Time,The great Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford team up to give fun and entertaining performances. Their talents and chemistry alone are well worth the price of admission.
2,Made my skin worse :(,"I was so excited about this product, I had read good reviews of it, and had read the studies about niacinamide and how it is a great topical anti-inflamitory making it great for rosacea. Well, it made my face redder and covered with tiny red dots. I then went to the rosacea sufferer's forum and read how for some rosaceans niacinamide works and the others it makes their rosacea worse, so I guess I fall into that last category :( I was so disappointed and saddened, I really thought from all I had read that I had finally found that magic potion for my rosacea, well, back to the drawing board. I do not blame the product, I think if you do not react to it it will work for you and this has a good amount in it with nothing you don't want, but just know that niacinamide is not for everyone and you never know if you might be one of the unlucky ones...."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Plain and simple-IT DOES NOT WORK! Naturally clear skin system did not clear up my acne, in fact, it made it even worse! The scrub was so rough that I couldn't use it every morning and night. The spray had no affect on my acne and the pills smelled horrible. Naturally clear skin system does not work and I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
5,JellyCat Truffle,"This took about a full week to receive, but it was well worth the wait! We bought it for our 8 month old and he loves it. It will very likely become his favorite stuffed animal, and it is large enough to last him for many years! Be sure to order a ""truffle"" if you want the one that lays flat. We ordered a ""bunglie"" on accident the first time."
3,all bagged up,"I have purchased other Jellycat products and another Large Chaucer Truffles somewhere else. This time I ordered one from my beloved Amazon.com. It came with other items but was bagged tightly and sealed in plastic. This poor stuffed animal came out looking as though it had been used already. Some of it's fur was a bit matted too. I know, you're saying I should have sent it back. But I thought of all the real animals we've had from the humane society that were not at all perfect but beautiful in their own right. Yes, I'm nuts; I kept the imperfect Chaucer Truffles that I call Jelly for when our grandchildren visit. He also sits on top of the red leather sofa, next to me, in our family room!Amazon take note please.......even though I'm not sending it back; I'm disappointed in your source."
3,Good but massively incomplete...,"How can this book talk about sex in the heartland and not talk about Wilt the Stilt Chamberlain? How does a former KU student who claims to have slept with 20,000 women in his lifetime not end up at least at some point in a book about sex at Kansas? Still the book is interesting and informative, but I really feel like there should have been a chapter on Wilt."
5,Thick and creamy,"Unique honey, that is spreadable, really impresses me. I like the flavor, slightly vanilla. Not too sweet, good on bread. The only honey I can eat alone from my finger."
3,"Great Product, found it much cheaper","This is a superior product and if you don't want to shop around, I would recommend ordering it. Unfortunately when I placed my order the price was over $16 per jar. i did find it for significantly less at a nearby store. If the price is under $10, I would order it again."
4,everything but volume control,"I'm stingy with stars, so most folks would probably give this a five. I travel a lot with my laptop (even if it's just down to the coffeeshop) so a headset that allows me to pack up and set up quickly is good. I've spent maybe $10 less for several headsets that were flimsy, but the cords on this device are amazing. It would take an intentional act of vandalism and perhaps a sharp object to pull loose any of the cable joins on this. They are really well put together.The retractible mic is great, and it's flexible, so I can adjust it to not be deadly annoying. The gain and sensitivity is great. It's good for skype (which I use extensively for international calls for work) and gaming (Turbine in-game chat, ventrilo, teamspeak, what have you).The only thing I miss is an in-line volume control.All in all, a well-designed, well-engineered device, which I expect will last me far longer than the less costly but cheaply made headsets I've had in the past."
2,"Okay headphones, lousy microphone.","Purchased these for use while playing online games. They sound like they should have costed 25 bucks, not 45. Not horrible, just very mediocre. The microphone went dead after 2 weeks of use. And for the 2 weeks the microphone did work, I recieved complaints that I was hard to hear/understand. My 10 dollar desktop microphone works significantly better. Very disappointed with this purchase."
2,Not worth the savings,I had this not even a month before I stopped using it. The phone does not stay connected to the charger. Not worth the savings...buy the charger from your service!
1,"Simplest Things Cannot be Found, Even in The Index!","LESS THAN 1 STAR.I took a class in Quark 4 and wanted a book to supplement the instruction, so I purchased this book, (Quark can seem quite difficult when you are beginning to learn about it). I needed something that I could turn to quickly to find out how to do something without wading through pages and pages trying to find it. Sam's Teach Yourself QuarkXPress in 14 Days? -- NOT!Want a well-edited book on Quark with an easy-to-follow layout? Get the Visual Quickstart Guide published by Peachpit Press."
1,Words cannot describe my disappointment in this book!,"The textbook is difficult to follow and the accompanying CD does not contain all the necessary items to successfully complete any of the lessons listed in the book. So far, nobody in my class, including the instructor, was able to follow the instructions given in this insufficient textbook. In my opinion, it is a complete waste of money and time. I am sure there are better product available!"
1,Awful book,Plenty of errors. Imposible to learn Quark in 14 days. Most excercises have errors when you open them and you don't enjoy learning the software whith the CD content.
1,directions unclear and examples are often in correct,I am very disapointed with this tutorial. I have found many mistakes and have spent hours cross referencing what the book says to do with the quarkxpress reference book. It has been very frustrating. I would not recomend it at all! If adobe classroom in a book were to write it than I would happily purchase it.
2,hard to watch,"i almost purchased this one a while back and decided to rent it instead; boy am i glad i did that. i agree with a previous reviewer that yeoh is stiff as a board when it comes to acting in this flick. she never puts her own spin on the character, not like the coolness of a chow yun fat or the silliness of a jackie chan. too little action and too uninteresting of a plot to pay full price for this dvd. if you can find it used or only want to finish a hk dvd collection, it might be worth getting, but i suggest renting this if you have any doubts"
1,Its not SuperCop,"And its certainly no Justice to Michelle Yeoh, go watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon or see The Heroic Trio to truly see her do her thang. This film was boring, no action scenes, no martial arts. And jackie chans cameo was embarassing. This movie is crap all the way. I hate to say that, but it was so boring."
1,Unbearable,"I don't expect much from martial art movies but action. This movie didn't even have that! I was facinated by Michelle Yeoh after seeing her in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". I was hoping to see more of Michelle Yeoh's skills in this one, but the movie didn't catch my attention long enough. I only recommend this movie for insomniacs!"
1,bad movie,This movie is really hard to watch! Jackie Chan is not in the sequel of his movie! why? i don't know. But i know that this movie is not good.
3,Good movie done poorly,"Don't let the reviews misguide you, on either account, this was a potentially good movie done horribly wrong. Yeoh is a great figher, and she's just as quick and nimble as Chan, but we are only treated to one real right scene by her? Not only that, but that fight scene is interrupted by her Co-stars less than stellar fight scenes? Is it because she's female? Heck, it got so bad at one point, that it looked like Yeoh was going to be beaten do death (literally) by a hired goon. Why 3 stars? Cause she beats the crap outta the goon in a spectacular manner and does some of her trademark poses afterwards."
3,Good Hong Kong Action.,"Now I said good--not great! This is a Michelle yeoh film, as the box states, not a Jackie Chan film, JC is in it for a strange 5 minutes. Yeoh is good--some excellent fight scenes, but the dubbing is horrible and the DVD has no option to leave it with subtitles- a big no-no. It's your basic HK action film with a little bit of story that may have worked, but the dubbing & delivery get in the way. I recommend Yeoh in ""Wing Chun"" for a fun traditional martial arts film."
4,Awesome Michelle Yeoh HK Movie!,"Ok, anyone who says the movie stunk because Jackie Chan isn't in it more than 5 minutes is a fool! It says right on the box ""Michelle Yeoh is Supercop 2"" and in little tiny print it says ""With a special apperance by Jackie Chan as Inspector Chan"" (His character from Supercop). This movie starts off with a bang and just keeps on going, and going! Michelle Yeoh is so awesome in this flick! She plays Jessica Yang (also her character from Supercop), and the semi-villian in the movie is played by Yu Rong Guang, who is an amazing actor (just see Iron Monkey, by Yuen Wo Ping, and you'll see why!) Anyhow, this movie is totally awesome, and the scene with Jackie Chan is very short, but really funny. I'd have given the movie five stars, but it ends sort strange, and it took away from the overall greatness of the movie. (Not that it was a bad ending, it just went too quick.) Anyway, see this movie! It rules!"
4,Very Satisfied,"Received my order very quickly; very satisfied with the product. Was replacing this item from having previously had it and lost it. Great protector for your phone when running, exercising,etc."
5,excellent !!!! good service !! A+++,"good product, my son loves it for his blackberry it fits perfect and good quality too .I recommend it !!!!"
5,Leather Pocket Case for Blackberry Pearl,"I received the Leather Pocket case for the Blackberry Pearl in like 1 or 2 days - faster than anything I had ever ordered from Amazon (without paying for the next day service).The first thing you notice is the excellent craftsmanship. The quality of the leather and stitching are exceptional. There is also the word ""Blackberry"" pressed into the front of the case, and the 7 dot logo pressed into the back.Next, I tried the Leather Pocket Case. The phone fits perfectly into it. It is a nice, snug fit. The phone won't just fly out. And yet it is made in such a way that taking the phone out when you need to is pretty easy.The case is substantive and the fit snug enough to allow for small bumps and drops. At the same time, the phone in the case is still compact enough to fit into a pants pocket.Finally, and I am not sure how it does this, but the phone goes into standby mode AS it is entered into the case - very cool.The Leather Pocket Case - Excellent choice."
3,It leaves the top exposed,"It's a nice compact case; however, the top remains exposed creating an opportunity for chips. I had it occurred the first week of ownership even though I was very careful. Obviously, it is more a function of the phone than the case. You have to protect the phone from all sides specially the top because it's made of a different material than the sides."
5,Trial.....and lots of errors,"This is an excellent account of the successes and failures as navies in the late 19th century moved from the world of wooden sailing ships to the new technology of steam and iron. As the leading navy of the era, the British Royal Navy is the central player in this drama, but the book also includes how the other leading navies of the era were addressing the same problems. The author discusses how they addressed the issues of propulsion, armor, firepower, stability, habitablity, doctrine, and costs in a technological world without any precedents to guide them. In doing so, he convincingly refutes charges of incompetance leveled against the major warship designers of the era. I was surprised at some of the technology that was developed. For instance, one Italian battleship had 17.72"" guns - foreshadowing Yamato's 18"" guns from WWII. The many photos are very useful and reveal some of the ugliest vessels to ever float."
5,The worst Sun Ra is better than most other stuff,"There is no ""typical"" Sun Ra, however this one is unique. Way unique. Well worth hearing."
3,One Massive Hallucination,"This is a maddening book that I read more than once (several years ago). Violent and nightmarish, it is told through the eyes of several characters that eventually converge in an apocalyptic encounter in ""Lagoon, Wyoming.""If you can stomach the lurching scene shifts and violence, ""Crab Canon"" contains some absolutely stunning prose, particularly in the first chapter (set on a remote Saskatchewan farm). It is obvious that Keeble is a writer of considerable talent; he went on to write the crime mystery ""Yellowfish"" and the definitive account of the Exxon Valdez disaster, ""Out of the Channel,"" both of which are excellent.I cannot say whether I recommend this work or not. Suffice to say that it is guaranteed to be like nothing else you have ever read, and you may thank me--if you don't throw ""Crab Canon"" through a window first."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,I have bought this item two times since I can't find it anywhere else. They break way too easily. New ones start leaking after two uses. I bought 3 sets 2 months ago and one set is useless already. I did not do anything but refreeze after using and they could not stand up. I wish I could find a higher quality item of this exact model.
2,lovely to look at but don't last,these mugs are very pretty but they don't last very long.the blue ones didn't last through being frozen the first time.they leaked all over my freezer.of the set of 6 only 2 are still any good.
1,Already leaking...,"Not even a month has gone by, and one of the mugs has already leaked the freezable liquid all over the freezer. Very disappointed."
3,meh -,"Two of the mugs were broken when I opened the box. One was obviously broken, but the other wasn't so it broke and spilled in my freezer.The remaining four work just fine and just as expected, though I'm so concerned that they will break at any minute it's hard to enjoy them."
3,Leaky Freezer Mug,"One of the six mugs I received had leaked during shipment. After sending a picture of the damaged product they replaced the mug for free and shipped it to me immediately. Overall the mugs do what they are supposed to do, they keep your drink cold, unfortunately as the mugs warms back up, the outside of the mug sweats badly and will leave a pool of water on whatever surface you leave it sitting on. I recommend you set it on a paper towel or glass surface so it does not cause any damage."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Very cheaply made, not worth the money. Cost $10 to ship for a total cost of $30 and not worth it, they leaked the first time we used them and have thrown away two so far. Save your money and buy good ones."
2,Tend to leak,I have had to throw two of these mugs out already. During freezing they leaked from the bottom seam. I think they are supposed to be put in the freezer upside down but I did not see any instructions saying that. They do not leak when I put them in upside down. I really do not trust them anymore.The red mug is really a pink color.
4,They work great!,"Pros:Great for the cost...especially since you get six mugs, not just two. They work very well. They keep the drink cold down to the last drop.Cons:They seem a bit cheap. If you don't care about aesthetics or looks, these are fine. Also, the colors I got were pink and blue, not orange and blue like the picture. Which is fine for us...my wife and I can tell whose drink is whose, but again, it's a matter of looks."
1,Only two left,After getting the mugs 4 of them leaked and I had to throw them away. I would not purchase this product
1,Useless,Product fell apart at the seams within weeks. Couldn't return it as I was overseas. On return to US 5 months later I tried to return it only to be told that guarantee is only three months. Very poor product and even worse customer service.
2,Mediocre,"These earrings are extremely delicate and flimsy. Fairly low quality, but you get what you pay for."
3,Decent bag,"This backpack is good for school. It has a large main compartment with a padded computer sleeve (holds a 15"" laptop computer). The padding isn't all that great...I can feel the computer pushing up on my back when I ride my bike to campus. The bag also has two dual mesh pockets that can hold two 0.5 liter water bottles, which is great for biking. The media (cell phone, I-Pod, etc.) pocket on one of the straps is really small. It won't hold most cell phones and it definitely wont hold any of the older generation I-Pods. Overall, a decent bag."
2,WARNING: THERE ARE NO SHARKS IN THIS MOVIE!!!,"This movie is mildly diverting at best... And shameful for insinuating there might be sharks by posing as a sequel to OPEN WATER. Be forewarned: There's not one shark in the entire movie. Sure, the premise is a big freaky and it's supposedly based on true events. But the characters do very dumb things and aren't very likeable making their situation eventually very wearisome for us viewers."
2,i hoped for a few things,"i agree with other viewer i though this would e a little like how blair wich 2 was the first blair wich was just camer and part 2 though it was no moiv of year you see thing voices, ghost, noises, you see things, i was disapoined about the no sharks in this one"
3,A Bit Loud,"Based on other reviews I chose this humidifier expecting it to be very quiet. It was actually quite loud so we returned it and have purchased another. If not for the bedroom, perhaps it would have been ok. We turned it off before we got a sense of how well it humidified as we could not sleep."
3,Not bad but not the quietest humidifier,"This humidifier is good, but it is not the quietest one I've had. I have a much quieter one in my bedroom which actually appears to humidify the air better also as it uses more water. However, the gentle white-noise of this humidifier is good as it drowns out other noises at my toddler's naptime and at night too. And it does slowly humidify the room so I have to rate it as ok. I believe the one I have in my room is a Sunbeam, it's really very quiet."
1,lame product,"waste of money. We used to have one, it died. Bt since we had 4 filters left, we decided to try it again. It really is only a white noise machine, as no mist/cool air comes out. The water level stayed teh same for days. We gave up & bought one of the frog shaped ones you can get ahywhere & it works great. Do not buy this as it is a waste of money."
1,Rubber glue oder,"I bought this yesterday at Target and will be returning it immediately. I noticed an unpleasant, rubber glue or plasticy smell when I opened the package, but decided to hook it up anyway. Big mistake. Now the room I was trying to humidfy for my sick baby smells awful...I truly don't think it is safe for him to sleep in a room with such odor that obviously portends fumes."
1,piece of crap,this was the worst humidifier i have ever used. it was an absolute piece of crap. we purchased this item for our nursery and the first time we used it it leaked all over the entire floor. at first i thought we had placed the tank on incorrectly but after looking it over all of the parts were in working order. we took it apart and put it back together again and hoped that maybe this time it would be alright. (after placing it on a tile floor to test out). for the first 3 hours it was going fine. as soon as the machine was turned off it leaked out all over the place again. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!
4,Good if you like the fan sound,"This is not a ""quiet"" humidifier, it sounds like a small fan which was perfect for us since we usually sleep w/fans for noise anyway. It does not blow out a whole lot of moisture quickly, but will not get your carpet wet. We've had it 2 years and it still going."
2,"Not that quiet, easy to spill water when cleaning daily","I have had this unit for almost 3 years. As far as durability, it's still working 3 years later. However, it goes through filters often. However, every humidifier I've bought goes through filters quickly. Its a problem with filters, but it keeps bacteria out of the air better than other kinds. The bigger problem was finding replacement filters. It took much web surfing to find a place to buy them from. If you buy this unit, I recommend buying several filters at a time, that way you always have some on hand.My biggest problem with the unit is that the lowest setting is not that quiet. I also did not think it did the best job humidifying the air.One other issue I had was emptying the ""base"". I ended up spilling water every time I carried it to the sink. Other models have a larger base and spilling water is not a problem."
1,This humidifier doesn't humidify,"I've had this for over a year now. Replacement filters are hard to find, and this doesn't work without one. Also, the filter goes moldy really quickly. You can't reach into the tank to clean it. And it doesn't humidify-- it just blows cool air. I hate this thing."
2,Where are the filters?!,"I hate to buy a replacement humidifier since I bought this one less than a year ago, but I can't find replacement filters! The original filter mildewed and I can't find another. Buyer's remorse."
5,FABULOUS-,"Professional backup for you to solo in whatever key- c, bflat, eflat, your instrument is in. really fun to improvise and learn the ""art"" of jazz. This is a must for anyone wanting to learn how jazz musicans improvise."
2,not easy to use,"I think you already have to have a jazz background to make sense of this book. It was recommended by our great school band leader, but we were unable to figure it out. Our piano teacher didn't get much farther with it when we asked her for help either."
2,-,"I have been doing research about multicultural picture books and had high expectations for this book because it seemed like it was going to be good. And it did start off pretty good...but then there are strange interjections about how Mexico is poor, and shows Mexican children dirty and shoeless and then American kids having fun as tourists with shoes on.Not to mention I think the authors misunderstood the term mariachi with a trio (big band with horns, strings, and singing) as opposed to the depicted ""trio"" they show. I would have thought the National Geographic society could at least do some fact checking.While the mixed media pictures were pretty, I think this book drops the ball."
1,shipping,"I'm guessing the pillows are nice, but the shipping is outrageous. I went to order one and found the pillows are 12.99, but the shipping and tax are about 20 dollars. Come on. You can't tell me it costs that much to ship a pillow. A big rip off and not worth the money!"
5,Nice basic pillow!,I like this pillow for a basic pillow. I also like the decorative pillows at discountpillow.info. They have a great selection.
1,So much for so little?,"I'm all for kindle books being $9.99 however I *may* be willing to spring for more if a book delivers more. According to amazon, however, this is 88 pages for $14. Sorry, but ""condensed"" is not the ""more"" I was thinking of. I'll pass on the kindle pricing if not the scholarship."
2,Janie Cook,I was very disappointed in the recipes in this book. Mabel Hoffman's original book with recipes for crock pots is very good. My advise is to stick to that one and forget this one.
2,Healthy Crockery Cookery,Most of the recipes had long lists of ingredients. The recipes didn't sounded enticing. I love cookbooks but I returned this one!
2,Not bad - but not what I hoped for.,"I have only been ""crocking"" for a few years so I'm certainly still learning about what tastes good and what works etc.. I was hoping for more photos to go with the recipes, and more every day recipes, but did not really find those things. This is a good book for someone who has A LOT of different ingredients on hand. More of a gourmet cookbook and it just didn't suit my needs as a busy working single mom.The book would be perfect for more sophiticated cooks who want to plan a snazzy romantic meal for two or an all adult dinner party."
2,what is healthy,"I BOUGHT THIS COOKBOOK BECAUSE IT COMBINED TWO THINGS I WAS LOOKING FOR, CROCKERY COOKING AND HEALTY COOKING. IMMAGINE MY DIMAY WHEN MANY OF THE RECIPES WHERE HIGH IN FAT AND SODIUM. I TOOK THE BOOK BACK! THIS IS NOT MY IDEA OF HEALTY COOKING. IWOULD ALSO APPRECIATE FIBER AMOUNTS LISTED IN RECIPES"

3,Not working with Motorola HT820,The price was good and I did not find any information about the problem of pairing Jensen WBT420 with Motorola HT820. They do not work together. Will be glad to hear there is a solution.
1,"Not Universal Bluetooth, only works with some Jensen BT headphones","This is not a universal bluetooth product. It will not pair with anything I have (Jabra headset, Insignia headphones, Jawbone headset, Macbook, iMac). Does not properly broadcast profiles, probably doesn't use 0000 for passcode (but can't tell since it doesn't transmit profiles correctly). I would join a class action law suit regarding this ""lemon"" product FALSE ADVERTISING."
3,Good and bad......,I had purchased this with the Jensen headphones a long time ago. A bought another after frying my first set. A couldn't pair it with my S9 headphones or my other headsets......and I like to think I am pretty tech savy. hmmmmmmm
1,DOES NOT WORK,will not pair with JABRA BT620S headphones. Bluetooth is supposed to be a universal protocol like USB. This thing is a dud!
1,It is serious! Don't waste your money on this garbage!!!!!!,"I can feel nothing but only deceived when I try all methods to pair this ""JENSEN bluetooth transmitter WBT420"" with my motorola HT820 and my friend's Jabra headset but all failed.Within the box there is a WBT420, a charger, an audio line and a user guide, in which the pairing method is describing as follow:"" See the owner's manual of the reception device for instructions. Most Bluetooth enabled headphones will automatically pair with the WBT420.It may take up to 2 minutes for the WBT420 transmitter and your bluetooth audio receiver to pair. While the WBT420 and your audio receiver is pairing you will see the blue LED on the WBT420 flashing quickly. Once your WBT420 is paired you will see a slow and steady blinking.""However, when I turned it on and tried to pair it with Motorola, the LED on JENSEN simply flash quickly and lowly alternatively for several times and then become steady bright, no matter how you act on your receiver.What a mass?!"
3,Get what you pay for?,I just received my Jensen WBT420 a few days ago. I have been unable to pair it with my Jabra 620s headphones. I will update this review as needed.
4,Good,"These are very basic switch plates, but for the price, they're great. I had very old switch plates that were in bad shape. Replaced them with these and even though they are simple, it really makes a big difference."
4,The Inspiration for James Bond,"Patrick Dalzel-Job served under Ian Flemming during WWII and is said to be the inspiration for James Bond.Patrick passed away today (Oct 15, 2003) and in his obit, Yahoo news recounts:""Dalzel-Job's real life adventures certainly read like a James Bond novel. In one of most daring exploits in 1940, he disobeyed orders to rescue all the women, children and elderly residents from the Norwegian town of Narvik in local boats just before it was destroyed in a German bombing raid.""He only avoided a court martial after the King of Norway sent his personal thanks and awarded him the Knight's Cross of St Olav. Later in the war he commanded a team in one Fleming's undercover units which worked far ahead of allied lines in France and Germany."""
1,No offense to bratz lovers but EWWWW!!!!!!!!,"O.K. I really do not want to hurt anyones feelings here but being a Myscene type of girl and against sassiness , there could be a much more decent doll out there than the bratz dolls. There looks are sooooo SASSY ( which is NOT a good quality )and there clothes are inapropriet ( Myscene clothes are too but they are not so sassy ). We really should't teach young ( or older ) girls to be sassy and so into fashion and boys. And ( still no offense ) but the whole name thing is bad I mean who should or would want to be a brat? O.K. so I do not know to whether it is durable or fun but not liking them altogether led me to rate them 1 stars. I could be wrong about the durability and fun thing but the other stars from my perspective are right! Please lean twords other dolls parents these are to sassy! P.S. I don't think i would have that much fun with em'."
2,Wait for a new Nevra,"As a collector of Bratz for two years, I have never been so disappointed in the Bratz as I am with this doll! I waited until Nevra was released as a single doll (apart from the Disco set) and ended up spending the money for a doll with clothes that have been recycled from the Strut It! collection of Bratz. The whole point of each collection of dolls is to get the new looks for each season, however, included on Nevra is the Strut It! Yasmin's red blouse, Sasha's jeans, and Cloe's bag, cord skirt and black tank top. The only original items included with her are pierced earings and 3 bracelets. Nevra herself is gorgeous with nice thick hair and vivid blue eyes. Until the new 2004 fashion packs come out, I'm stuck with a doll who's a ""copy"" of all of her friends."
3,A classic western.,"Luke Short was a pseudonym for Frederick D. Glidden (1908-1975), an author of many popular western novels. This particular novel was voted in 1977 by the Western Writers of America as one of the top twenty-five westerns of all time. It was made into a film starring George Montgomery. The story is about a cattle ranch foreman, Will Ballard, who, following the death of the ranch's owner, attempts to hold the ranch together for the daughter and fight other ranchers trying to plunder the ranch land."
3,Meanders a bit,"These 2 records sound like much of the output Ra printed on his Saturn label during the 1970's and 80's - charming in places, but a bit meandering on the whole. A critic would call them ""thin"". Now, there is a real beauty to collecting as much of Ra's output as one can, and enjoying each recording as a fan of the band might enjoy a series of dozens or hundreds of live performances. And to Ra fanatics, an unearthing of these 2 records, previously unheard to any fans (even those who swap tapes of out-of-print Saturns) is a major archeological discovery. Evidence have done their usual studied, state-of-the-art job in mastering and packaging.To most of us though this is far from Ra and the Arkestra's best work, and I'd recommend that all but devoted fans start somewhere else."
5,Prime Time Fitness 11 (Bev Harris),I am 70 yrs. old and can do only l/2 of the video a day. I like Bev's personality and would recommend it for moderately active people 50 or above.
2,ZzzzZZzz...,"I personally feel that this book is exceptionally boring and has a very weak plot. I assume that the underlying theme of the book was to illustrate how the main character, Roz, copes and comes to terms with her mother's untimely death. While Roz is a complex character, I did not feel that most of her actions were rational or plausible. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not relate to Roz or even understand her actions/reactions. This is an extremely short book, however, I still had difficulty reading it without falling asleep. After I finished ""Tell Me Everything"" I was just happy that I was done."
1,Beware of offensive language,Roz's mother died trying to rescue Nate. for a year Roz has been trying to figure out exactly what happened that day on the mountain. Finally Roz has received enough signs that prove to her that she should try to find Nate and talk to him.This book is for mature readers only. It contains offensive language and adult subject matter (the mother was raped and her 12-year-old daughter is a product of that).
2,This was a dull book with no plot.,"""Tell Me Everything"" was one of the most boring books I have ever picked up. There was a lot of symbolism involved, so it was very hard to follow. This book was also unrealistic. The character Roz wasn't at all like the children in our world today. So take my advice and don't give this book a chance!"
2,Noble but a Bit Limp,"Yakovenko and Scheps struggle along. They are fine musicians. But their efforts don't rise above the merely very good.Baritone Yakovenko's voice tends to trail off when he sings more quietly. He's got a biggish rich Russian bass-baritone, and it's pleasant and sometimes thrilling. But he lacks a certain artistry in forming a nice legato line--which is perhaps difficult in this material.Perhaps the engineer's a bit to blame. The recording lacks punch. Stormy piano passages don't grab our attention.For Russian songs Kharitonov and Hvorostovsky are hard to beat. Kharitonov's album of Rachmaninov songs from EMI is sublime!"
2,Hobbled by bad book design,"It's not like designers at Penguin Classics are lackingthe knowledgeOf how to handle hexameters. Why then their failureto use itIn Raeburn's recent translation of Metamorphoses?On an average page, there's barely three verses that'stypeset withinA single line, with all others continued with vastindent--And most roving over a single word. The pages areugly,Everything awkward to read. The font size is generous,though,So why not reduce it a point and gather more versestogether?Nor does it help that the poem is written in thumpingsub-Longfellow,With all of the beats but now with just one third thesonority--Dietetically versed. Avoid this volume. Feh, and morefeh."
5,Unpleasant Surprises and no Happy Endings.,"Publius Ovidius Naso was born in 43 B.C and died in 18 A.D.He was banished for unknown reasons to Tomi, a barren place near the coast of the Black Sea. A few scholars believe that this was a literary hoax created by Ovid himself. It would enable him to write the 'Tristia' and 'Letters From The Black Sea'.'Metamorphoses' is his main achievement. It contains 250 stories from the Greek Mythology and they all have in common that the principal character changes into another form. Most of the time they turn into an animal or a tree but also in a river, a constellation of stars, a rock or a flower and other pleasant surprises.If you read this book you won't find many happy endings. The ancient Greeks didn't know the meaning of that expression.It's not an easy read but if you persist it will be a rewarding literary experience."
3,Not the best fit for a SP01 Tactical,"I have a Fobus paddle holster for a Glock 19 that I like. So I bought this for my CZ SP01 Tactical. Does not fit very well, the retention is looser than I would like. Maybe it fits the other listed guns better."
3,Did not fit my CZ 75 P01 very well,Holster is not adjustable and was just too difficult to draw my CZ 75 P01. I nearly needed two hands to get it out. Put a light rub mark on my slide after un-holstering just 3 times. Otherwise a nice holster. Might be good for your Sig or Ruger.
2,For use with my Ruger P345,"I bought this holster knowing it was more of a ""universal"" holster and after doing some research online found it should fit well. I received it, opened up the packaging and inserted my UNLOADED Ruger in it and put up a real fight to get it back out. I thought I was going to break it before I would get my gun back. After about 12 draws it's loosening up a little but still takes two hands to draw. The trigger guard snags on the indent on the holster. Some other owners have cut this section out to loosen up the holster. For $40 shipped I will modify the holster a bit to still be able to securely hold my gun while still being able to draw it without a fight in case of an emergency.I would recommend a different holster for your Ruger P345 than this."
2,p345 with rail,I have a new p345 with a rail and this holster will not work. the rail creates too much surface pressure and you can't remove weapon without a fight.I didn't notice in the description if it specified for railess p345 or not. My bad. I now use the holster for a door stop.
2,A little worrying,"While these locks look nice and work properly, I'm a bit concerned by the fact that all four locks I purchased (2 separate sets of 2) could be opened by the same key. I haven't been able to find any information about this, so it's entirely possible that all of these locks can be opened be the same key (or a small number of keys). If that's the case, where's the security?"
2,Don't bother,"I bought these as an introduction to potty training my daughter and they are meant to be absorbent like diapers but when they reach they're capacity they sag REALLY bad, they even sag before they're soaked. I can't tell you how many times my daughter had been playing and she comes to me with the diaper in hand because it just slides off. Save your money and get something else."
3,Good for smaller babies,"I liked this diaper because my daughter is on the smaller side. It actually fits if you're trying to potty train at 18 months. All other companys start at 2T, too big. I wish that the side was velcro like the older age diapers though. The sides rip, not so appealing to me."
5,Practical Help--Not Speculative Jargon!,As a busy pastor I was looking for some idea help for a sermon series on the Book of Revelation without getting into the debatable topics that divide. This aged book has the helpful ideas to spur thoughts and let you write your own. Timeless truths in a dated medium equals a wonderful mine for fertile thinking from one of the best of yesteryear. I highly recommend it. It will spur your own thinking which is the purpose of study. GMM
3,Does not fit Kole Audio MFW-12 subs,"These look like they are high quality, but unfortunately they don't fit the aforementioned subs. made of a flexible metal, these things would get the job done."
3,"Subwoofer 12"" Grills","The grills are fine but they are a bit too small, at least the brackets are, for my JL subs which protrude from the box about an inch. I think the brackets should be made a little wider or the grills maybe 1/4"" bigger so that they will mount to the box properly."
4,Works well for my application,Using this on my IDQ12. They are pretty durable and I have thrown lots of crap on top of them. I have lots of tools and random junk floating around in my trunk and this grill adds maximum protection over say a bar style grill. Granted it isnt perfect for it as the mounting lip on the idq is around 1/3 inch thick and these were designed for a sub with a very flat mounding lip. I just angled em up and they still hold onto the lip of the sub well. I would give five stars except for that issue and the fact that they dont come with screws so I had to make a separate trip to the hardware store to buy screws.
1,WORST PS2 WIRELESS EVER,"This is absolutly the worst PS2 acessory I have ever bought!! MadCatz is about the worst company for wireless products in my opinion. There are some very large bugs that MadCatz should have worked out before putting this controller on the market. These are the flaws:-The controller is not responsive when 10 or more feet away-The controller is a battery sucker (2 weeks)-The controller is poorly designed overall-The ""L"" and ""R"" buttons do not work at all-The four main buttons do not work well and you have to push down very hard to get responseOverall this is the most poorly designed controller that I have ever owned. I really think that you should not buy this product! BAD, BAD, BAD, MADCATZ!!!"
1,Why Can't I Choose *Zero* Stars?,"We tried the MadCatz and received a defective unit. So we combed over the instructions with a fine tooth, tried and re-tried, tested batteries, etc. No deal. So we exchanged it for another unit and got the same result. So we asked the guy at the store (the manager) to show us how to set it up (we never had problems with other controllers, wired or remote) and he failed to get it to work. Get this: he then tells us that he gets lots of returns on MadCatz controlers! I asked him why he bothers to sell them? He didn't have an answer. I can't waste my time buying junk only to have to return it. We paid an extra $10 for a Logitech wireless controller and it works perfectly!"
1,Madcatz is Badcatz,Madcatz wireless controllers are virtually useless. Don't bother trying to play any games that require any type of timing involved as the lag on these controllers is horrible.
3,FOOT CREAM,I am happy with this product. Doesn't feel greasy on your feet. Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops. Probably won't spend the extra money on this product when their are similar products available in the chemist at a cheaper price.
1,And?,"And? What more ingredients? You are not naming all ingredients. It has parfum/ fragrance in every product seacret has that can cause health issues and is not chemical free nor natural!I do not opt to buy any products with sodium borate, parfum/ fragrance, any with "" methyl"" words or sodium hydroxide in it!"
3,Did not seem very fresh,"The box arrived soaked on sesame oil. The individual bars were all covered in oil, though sealed. The bars were hard and gummy. I do not know if that is normal for this brand or if these were improperly stored. The sell by date had not been reached, so they were not expired. The halvah I had previously enjoyed was much lighter and flakier and that texture was what made them so good. These were shipped out of AZ, so maybe a hot warehouse or truck contributed to this? Not really certain, but somewhat disappointing. Since I do not know if this is normal for ""Camel"" brand halvah, I am giving them a 3 star rating. I should add that this box shipped from Nutricity."
1,Was not tasty at all,My daughter didn't like it at all. It has a weird taste and she didn't want to touch it anymore. I felt like just wasting my money and I really regret placing that order .
1,Don't pay money for this free promotional item!,"Fruits Basket is a fine series, but do not waste your money on this item.These disks were given away for free by a number of retailers as a promotion from the publisher Funimation. This contains only the first 2 episodes, which you would have to by again to get the whole series.Try buying the Viridian Collection or at least volume 1 of the series. If you have any love for the series, you will kick yourself when you realize the money you wasted on this item."
3,Bolt holes larger than bolts,Bolt holes on both work support mounting brackets are larger than the bolts sent with stand. Other than that the stand is a nice looking stand.
5,mitersaw stand,"this stand is good quality, yet it only came with 4 mounting bolts instead of the 6 it needs. it doesnt fit all saws and in the instructions at least it shows it to be mounted upon a board to be mounted for all brands of mitersaws.its perfect height for the average size men yet i agree with the othere responces it should be on wheels for easy moving . now i gotta locate wheels and adapt them for this saw table."
5,Denali miter saw stand,"This is an outstanding value. The stand works correctly, I mounted a off brand 12 sliding chop saw and have had no problems at all. The stand is also very durable, I put it thru a lotDenali Miter Saw Stand."
3,"It's ok, but...","Yes, it works. The legs and other structural metal pieces are stable and strong. The miter saw clamps attach easily to the stand and hold the saw securely. But...I've had a hard time getting the rollers to stay in position. The locking knobs press a piece of metal against the vertical support shaft, but don't really exert enough pressure to firmly clamp the roller in place.The knobs look and feel like they're built to a functional, but minimum spec. If there was a way to save a gram of plastic without compromising the overall function, they did.It's picky, but the orange plastic is bright, almost florescent orange...the same color as the stuff from HF Tools. It makes the stand look really cheesy.As I said, it works. But if you like to buy tools that last, you should look at more expensive stands."
4,Denali Miter Saw,Works pretty well so far. I think it was worth buying this as apposed to spending the time and materials to build something that would be bigger to store as some of the books I have read suggest.
5,Fantastic !!! High quality at a low price.,"I was a little skeptical at the quality of this product with such a low price. I have been to Lowe's, Home Depot and Sears and looked at some for around $100 bucks the ones i saw where pretty poor. I thought that this couldn't be any worse than what i saw at the retail stores and took the plunge. I trusted the reviewers before me and crossed my fingers. I agree with all the people that gave it 5 stars because this stand is fantastic. It has the quality of a Dewalt at the price of Black&Decker. I mounted my 10"" Dewalt dw713 and it fit like a glove. Very Solid, easy to set up, looks like it should last for a while. If your looking for a very nice stand without going broke this is the very best. Enjoy:)"
3,Not as sturdy as I would like,"If you plan to use this in one spot in your shop, it's probably a good buy for you. It is not sturdy enough to be used as a mobile, construction site platform. Many/Most of the adjustments are plastic and will not hold up to normal worksite usage. However, if you need a Miter saw stand in your shop for occasional use, this stand will do the job at a reasonable price point."
4,Fairly sturdy stand,"I bought this for some occasional light-duty work and I think it suits my needs just fine. Although it is heavier and more sturdy than I expected for the price, it is probably not as sturdy as some of the more expensive models. I'd recommend this for the light DIY'er like myself but the professional or hard-core DIY'er would probably need something a little more serious."
5,Four Stars ... Solid Product,"The stand arrived and was packaged very well. All the parts were present. The assembly was very minimal. The product works well with my Bosch compound saw. The saw slides easily across the rails. It's easy to unlock the saw from the stand, remove it, and relocate the stand. Putting the saw back on is a breeze .. the handles on the front lock it in place. The extensions work well, but on one of mine, the plastic-handled screw wasn't long enough to seat against the rail and lock the extension in place ... after cutting a few pieces too long, I realized the extension was moving. I had to find a longer screw to fit. Besides that, this stand was a good investment. Very easy to use. Very sturdy. I'd buy it again."
4,Fantastic stand.. though the box was open upon arrival.,"I am very happy with this stand.. Not easy to move around though (no wheels)... perfect fit for my Dewalt 10"" miter saw. Check the contents upon arrival... Mine was torn open and I could tell parts were tossed around a bit. Can't beat the price!!"
4,Easy and effective,"Knowing that I had no place for my new Miter Saw meant I had to find a solution. Luckily, I succumbed to the 'recommended' products from Amazon below the product page for my saw. As it turned out, not only was the Denali less expensive that others, as it turns out, it was both well made and convenient to set up and use. Not always a fan of even clicking on 'recommendations' based on my search terms or purchases but I have to say, this one time worked out. The Denali is sturdy and take only a few minutes to put together and then start using. Seems well made and hopefully will last for quite a while. So far so good however. Holds my Hitachi miter saw well and can handle wood more than 8' long."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"I was looking for an affordable stand for my miter saw- and decided on the Denali based on (1) The reviews, and (2) The price. This stand is built very robustly and my 12"" Hitachi double-bevel saw fits nicely. This stand looks to be exactly same as the Ryobi at Home Depot ( the only differences being cosmetic )- but $20.00 less expensive! A set of wheels would be a nice addition for mobility as the saw and stand together are over 100 lbs. All said- a great buy!"
4,Good stand with reasonable price,Pro: The Denali stand is easy to setup and does not cost much comparing to other brandCon: A little heavy to carry in/out
3,Good value but definite flaws,Bought this stand about one year ago. True to other reviews it is a sturdy stand and well made. The holes in my10 inch Hitachi compound chop saw did not align with those in the provided base bars so I had to fab an adapter - no real problem. Like other reviewers mentioned one of the clamp bolts for the sliding support was the wrong length. My biggest issue turned out to be the plastic clamps on the base - did not survive loading and unloading into the pickup truck. The old addage proves true - <where plastic and metal meet plastic loses>
4,Tall and versatile,"As a tall person, I like a stand that is tall as well. This is a well built product that comes with many nice accessories. The only drawback is that if you must move the stand, you have to watch for ground obstructions. The self-locking mechanism in the legs will fail if you push the stand against a non-moving surface. I haven't had any catastrophic failures, but I have been pushing this around in a small room and it has caught on a few items such as the bed and shop vac, which has caused the offending leg to begin to buckle. Luckily I was paying attention and averted any disaster. Overall, a great purchase for the money, but be carefull to reevaluate its stability when relocating this table."
3,Wasn't able to use,"I had to return this to Amazon - did not accommodate my 12"" compound slider. Be careful before you buy to make sure this will work with your saw."
5,good deal,this product works great. definitely worth the price and super easy to store. takes up no space at all. worth it
5,High quality Low price,"It's very easy to assemble and very sturdy. When it expands, it's 9' long.I have no problem in cutting the end of 12' long board.I mounted Bosch 10"" slider, it's rock solid.All material is really sturdy, I don't feel any vibration while cutting boards.One drawback is it's heavy even without the slider. When moving this stand, I detach the slider, which is a real easy job, and move individually.It's a real nice stand for the money and I recommend to anyone."
4,Surprising out of the box,"When I opened the box it came in, it was very well packed from the manufacturer, with absolutely no damage from shipping. Set-up was easy, and I'm very happy with how sturdy it is. The legs lock positively with a 'snap'. The extentable supports are steady and strong. The mounting brackets fit my 10"" Makita sliding compound mitre saw perfectly, and the finish overall is high-grade. For what I paid for this stand, it exceeded my expectations!"
4,A must-have,"The Horseowner's Guide to Lameness could easily be the one and only book every horseperson will ever need on the subject.From this book, readers can learn the details of skeletal and muscular equine anatomy through written description and excellent illustrations. Any imaginable lameness or unsoundness is covered here, with details of causes, symptoms, treatments and prognosis. The book also includes photos and x-rays to complete the picture.The one downfall of this book is that it is rather technical. It is not written in layman's terms nor does it waste page space with extraneous words. As a reference to horse owners and riders this book is invaluable, but it does require a certain amount of familiarity with anatomy terminology in order for the user to reap the full benefits. However, for anyone who owns or cares for horses, The Horseowner's Guide to Lameness is a necessity."
5,great video,This is a well done video. Photography is excellent and everything else is fantastic. I highly recommend this video. You will not be dissapointed!!
2,"SO,SO?","This show starts out very good and is very exciting for the 1st 10 minutes. A few big, beautiful very large and intimidating Lions are displayed at the start. Their manes are incredible. They look awesome. Then, The most beautiful and awesome Lions I have seen in a long time are totaly ignored for the next 75 minutes. Then, they again show a male LION FOR THE LAST MINUTE OR SO AND THE EXCITEMENT RETURNS AND THEN THE SHOW IS OVER. Instead of this show watch RELENTLESS ENEMIES, ETERNAL ENEMIES: LIONS AND HYENAS, LIONS OF THE AFRICAN NIGHT, THE LIONS SHARE, ROAR: LIONS OF THE KALAHARI AND A HOST OF OTHER DOCUMENTARIES RELEASED BY NATIONAL GEOGRPAHIC AND THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL."
5,Wonderful documentary!!!,"This movie is a wonderful documentary about lions. Set in Botswana, a story is told about a lioness who struggles, fights for and shows termedious courages for the survival of her three young cubs. This movie has breath taking landscapes and extraordinary animals all trying to survive within their world. This movie is a tear jerker so make sure you have a box of tissues."
3,Falling for dramatics and cinematography...,"Mutual of Omaha did a video on the swimming lions of Botswana back in 2003. This video was way less dramatic and did not have all the beautiful images that The Last Lions did. However, it also told of a mother teaching her cubs.The lions of this region have many adaptations to survive in these special habitat. These lions have developed thicker fur and stronger forelimbs in comparison to other lions that live in Kenya and South Africa. The lions of Botswana are very successful despite the watery environment. Not quite the dramatic overcoming that appears in Last Lions.While I do not discredit the beauty of this film, you really should watch both and do a comparison."
5,Heart Healthy Snack,Excellent tasting product containing heart healthy nuts and seeds without much of the heart unhealthy salt found in many other trail mix products. Salt is the last item on the ingredient list. It is also not very oily and I particularly like the generous amount of cashews in each package. The downside of being so enjoyable is that there are 800 calories per package (160 cal/serving) and it is very hard to eat just one small serving.Enjoy!
3,too many peanuts,"Pretty good snack mix, but definately was too heavy on peanuts. Bags seem to not be evenly mixed."
3,"healthy, Good, Seedy","I like healthy granolas and cashews so i naturally like this. My only complaint is they went a bit overboard on the small seeds. I ended up eating most of it and all I had left was the small seeds on the bottom. I like seeds but that was a bit much. I will try the other flavors though as I do like the trail mix. I was almost surprised at the amount of fat though: 12g per serving, 5 servings a bag."
3,myths n legends of the Chiricuahua Apatche,My partner is Lepan Apatche and Mescalero Apatche....his great grandmother was Commanche.. I am Tewa n Mescalero Apatche n Germain n Scottish n Irish. We enjoyed the book........wish it had stories relating to the myths n legends we grew up with.....although it is not myths. To our peoples.......they r truth n passed on to generations by our elders as ur Bible has to u..........the Wachichi........
3,Its OK,"This jungle CD is not the greatest one i've heard. The animals were, at times, very loud. I liked the birds and crickets throuought the CD, but I disliked the hyenas. Elephants trumpeting is fine with me, but every time the elephant stops trumpeting on the CD, it makes this very obnoxious bellowing and whining sound. That sound is so irritating! The good things on the CD were the birds, crickets, rain, Chimpanzees, gorillas, and howler monkeys. I guess the lions roaring was fine - it wasn't too loud. If you want a good jungle sounds CD, try Amazing Amazon in the Relax with Nature series. It doesn't have any loud animal sounds.I give this CD 3stars. Oh, one last thing. The animals are from all over the world and some of them were played at least 4 times. This included elephants and hyenas."
1,False Advertise,"The advertised as 36 pairs... they are only three pairs.Be careful, do not buy from this peopleI complained before they shipped, when I received their mail saying I was going to receive the three pair on the mail.When I replayed that I only wanted the 36 pairs and not to shipped it, they went ahead and delivered them.They know that to send it back you have to pay for the shipment, so chances are that you are stacked with it"
4,First PTV album,"This album is a great collections of songs that are well put together by Pierce the Veil. Although Selfish Machines is their best album, in my opinion, A Flair for the Dramatic is still enjoyable to listen to. It's nice to hear the band's earlier sounds."
3,This album simply does not compare to Selfish Machines,"I had heard about Pierce the Veil recently and picked up Selfish Machines. It's one of my favorite albums now. I would highly recommend picking it up if you don't have it yet. Almost every song on that album is fantastic.However, this album, A Flair for the Dramatic, just does not compare. There are no outstanding songs on this album. Most are just OK, some I don't even like at all. ""Yeah Boy and Doll Face"" is probably the best song on the album, but even that song is nowhere near as good as the worst song on Selfish Machines."
4,Mentions some situations ect not covered in other books,"...This book is written by a ""first dancer"" of Pavlova's company. For ten years he travelled with her company on its extensive European, US and Japanese/asian tours .Throughout which Oliveroff claims to have shared many asides and social situations with Mne Pavlova.As an avid reader on anything about Pavlova I was surprised to learn here that she smoked ciggarettes; drank vodka(russian style) and old tom gin. Many of her favourite dishes are also given reference.Not enough is known about Pavlova's private life because it is claimed she didn't have one! This book dosen't reveal any shocking secrets(other than the vodka and ciggarettes) but it does highlight some situations which in turn give us a fuller picture of her unique personality.It is worth reading and enjoyable!"
5,Daughter loved it.,"My daughter first watched this video at around 20 months and just loved the dog and got so excited. We ended up buying many more Madeline videos, but we still think this one is the best. Lots of songs and, of course, the dog!"
1,I Must Have Missed The Song. I'll Listen Again.,"I don't hate this album, but, then again, I wouldn't really classify this as an album; that word suggests that songs are involved. This is more like a collection of neat sounds. Any time The Microphones start to make something like cohesive music, they're off again before you know it to the recording of noise. It's really boring. Also, it has no pace or direction. It's totally fragmented. Maybe these folks want to take music in a new direction, but in order to do that you have to actually take a direction, which they have not."
1,Huh?? Which Part of the Series??,"This description doesn't include enough information to be useful. ""Heritage: Civilisation and the Jews"" refers to a book and to a set of about eight 60-minute video programs on VHS or DVD. So what is it that this ""Video Tape"" contains? (Unfortunately, this is a problem that comes up frequently on Amazon--does the book have a CD with it? etc. and there's no way to let anyone know except by writing a ""review"".)"
2,yaaawnnn,"I'd heard a lot of hype about these guys with many comparisons to groups I like. Suffice to say this is NOTHING like the ""Medway garage revival"" as is oft repeated. Over-produced songs with Elvis Costello-esque singing and they clearly take themselves waaay too seriously.This compilation has two songs which hold my attention (Mourn my health & Pop Star party, the rest range from mediocre to terrible.Before buying, I'd strongly recommned hearing samples first."
3,It should be a low budget independant film,"This movie kept on advertised on MTV over a 200,000 times so f#*king annoying. Nobodies cares about rap I like teen bubblegum pop. Ludacris came down for the 4th of July with his friends to make an ablum they had some geeky guy to be the D J. The movie ""Crash"" should of hit it bigger then this movie"
1,A Massive Mess!!!,What the hell was this. Terrance Howard must've owed somebody money. This was a total unadulterated mess. I have had better bowel movements than this. I am glad I didn't pay for this mess. THANK GOD FOR BOOTLEG!!! A bootleg that I didn't buy. Someone said that this was a John Singleton film. Please a white man wrote this mess. This crap was full of stereotypes and horrid acting. And why the hell was ol' girl sweating throughout the whole movie. And why was Terrance Howard dancing too hard. All I have is one word for this mess. AVOID!
1,"Pitiful uninteresting acting, tired story","Terrence Howard just starred in his first and last feature role. What a disappointment; I am shocked that this movie was as bad as it was. DJay in this movie is the lead character, yet he's a despicable piece of garbage who can't rap and is a pimp. Yep a no-good pimp who murders rivals and exploits women. DJay is not at all likeable; who wants to see a no-good loser make it anyway? Where are the movies showing brothers making it out of the ghetto as doctors or lawyers? There are 100x more of them out there, yet the media loves to lionize 'hustlas' like this loser DJay. What a load of garbage. An easily forgettable flick."
1,Useless!,"This kindle edition is a misunderstanding. Small matter that there is no table of contents to navigate it. But the text has no formating! The poems, not divided into verses, run like prose! Chaos, and a waste of time. I guess you get what you pay for, but still.."
5,The quintessential So Cal book for dirt road exploring.,"First thing that hits you is the heft of this book. It is large and heavy, but that just tantalizes you of what lies beyond the cover. It is full of so much information about southern California's backcountry you could spend hours and hours reading. But this book is to be used as a guide for exploring. And guide you it does. The maps, descriptions and details are excellent for each trail. The history section is great and my family and I even used this book to identify plants from its full color photos on our last outing. For anyone wanting to explore dirt trails in So Cal, from mild ones not really needing 4 wheel drive to more difficult ones, this book is for you. Rock crawlers need not apply, but for the other 99% of us with 4x SUV's this book is perfect!"
4,Very good,"This is the second book set in northern Canada that I've read by this author. I liked Isobel: A Romance of the Northern Trail better, but this one is definitely worth reading. It's about a railroad builder who finds himself in danger after meeting a woman. The author does a good job of combining mystery, romance and action to keep the story moving and to make you curious about what will happen next. I wish he had written more about living in the cold and snow to make you feel like you're really in northern Canada. I found the ending to be a little weak, but I can't explain why without giving the ending away. Other than that it's a very good book."
1,Don't buy to send Email cards and don't buy if you aren't familiar with Publisher!,This program is very cumbersome to use. It is NOT intuitive. If you have Windows XP you will not be able to send Email cards because they are .exe files and Outlook Express does not send or receive .exe files. There is NO technical support other than FAQ pages. Riverdeep software basically sends you a preprinted email that states that if you can't find your answer in the FAQ section there is nothing they can do. Do not buy any Broderbund product from now on unless you want to be aggravated.
1,Their pics or none,"Back when I was running Win98, I loved Printmaster Gold. But when I got my first XP, it became quite limited. I could no longer use my own pics.I got Printmaster Platinum, hoping it would be an improvement. I still couldn't use my own pics, and it ignored my scanner, despite the claim of TWAIN compliance. I've since tried other Broderbund apps, but got the same disappointing results. Where's a corporate buyout when you need one?"
1,Amazon website untruthful,"I bought this Printmaster Platinum through Amazon. When I installed it, I found that it was a 2006 version, and any offers of on online images and the like were void. I contacted Amazon, and some smart-alec said I bought a 2006 version. Nowhere on the site did it say it was an old, dusty version. The email sent back to me said to read the overview information carefully. Still no mention of a 2006 version.When I installed it, I found out it was a 2006 version...and being opened and installed, I can't return it. Amazon is the last place I'll buy any software in the future.The only good thing that happened, Amazon responded quickly. Why not, they scored another unfair sale.Printmaster - Platinum Version 18"
2,It's suck!,"I though this product is great like everybody said, but it's really is suck! It's difficult to install whole programs. And one more, the seller doesn't give refund free, I don't understand why? They just care to sell their staff, never care if customer satisfied or not. Never buy again!"
2,Disappointed,I thought I was going to upgrade when I went from PrintMaster Platinum 12 to PrintMaster Platinum 16. NO! PrintMaster 16 is much more combersome to use and I am so-o disappointed!
2,Not enough new content,I am a long time user of the Printmaster products. I have not seen enough new / original projects and art to justify the cost of this upgrade. I was disappointed.
2,"Not so ""Sweet 16""","I have been buying versions of PrintMaster for over 8 years and I was VERY disappointed in this version. I saw absolutely NO difference in PM ""Platinum"" 16 and regular old ""Gold 15"". In fact, I wrote the company and asked for my money back because PrintMaster 21 has just come out -- in fact, it was virtually within DAYS that version 21 was announced from when I received version 16.If this is your first PrintMaster, it's OK. If you think this is an upgrade -- forget about it!"
3,"OK, but poor support for unknown Program CD","I installed PrintMaster with no apparent problems, but there are three other CD's included in this package with no instructions or directions as to what to do with them (two Art CD and one Program CD). Even in the instruction manual or help files. I figured the Art CDs are just for storing additional art files. But the ""Program CD"" is a complete mystery. There are no descriptions, instructions, or help files regarding this Program CD. When I try to open it or install it in the CD drive, it does nothing except say it's a ""Program CD"". I'm still trying to contact the Tech Support people and after two days, they still do not reply. The software product seems to working fine without it, but it bugs me that I can not figure out what to do with this Program CD. Maybe it's just intended to be used as a Frisbee?"
4,Good For the Revolutionary War Student,"I read this to my 5th grade twins who are learning about the American Revolution. They probably wouldn't have picked it up for pure pleasure. Much of the old fashioned language was hard for them, but they said it was fun to hear about history from the point of view of a horse.It's basically about an English horse who is very anti-Colonist who learns to embrace the idea of freedom and the Revolutionary cause. You get to watch her change her opinion and how she describes the people, horses, and things she observes. It's a well written book."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"According to a former nation safety council member and approved CHP child seat inspector, this is NOT approved to use with a child seat. Do not buy this!! After our car seat inspection we returned this; better safe than sorry."
3,Eh...it's okay...,"I bought this with the expectation that it would protect my leather seats. My leather backseats (light gray leather is not a good color) ended up discolored by the mat on this product.Fortunately, it did protect from other markings and scratches and I was able to clean my seats well enough. If you have cloth backseats, this would be an ideal solution for protection, but I think overall this product and others like it might be overrated."
3,Good but not perfect,"It is a good product, nicely made but after using it only for a couple of weeks, I uninstalled my son's car seat and I noticed that it doesn't protect completely the leather from my back seat. What I found is a couple of dents from the pressure made by the car seat I thought they would come to normality if I gave it some time for the foam to react, but no it didn't. You want protection for your car? put a peace of card board underneath the car seat."
2,Spend the extra money on a nicer product,Whatever dye is being used on these protectors ends up rubbing off on the upholstery. Your seat may be protected from wrinkles and creases but they'll end up discolored if you have a lighter color interior.
5,love it,"This is easy to put in and easy to take out and clean. So much easier than trying to crumbs out of the folds in the seat!the worse part... it taking the car seats out and then puting them back in!cuts the cleaning of the auto down ALOT.The ""baskets"" in the bottom... I don't use those. My kids are still in boosters and car seats. They can't reach the baskets anyways."
5,LOVE IT!,Its perfect!! I dont know about the dye problem because my seats are black leather. But i love this! I would def recommend this product!
5,Works Great,"I have been using this for 3 years and have had no problems with discoloration on my tan leather seats. Super easy to install. I purchased a second one for my second child and am just as happy with it. Keeps food from falling between seats, saves seat from spills and make finding those lost precious ""toys"" much easier to find. Great product!"
1,Beware if you have light leather seats!!!!,This product bleeds dye!! Please save yourself the hassle and dont consider this seat protector if you have light colored seats. I had read one or two reviews that mentioned this but figured I would give it a try anyway and now I have 2 cars with black marks on tan leather.
4,Works great!,This seat protector covers the seat very well and was easy to use. I will be buying more for my other cars.
3,it works ok...,"This works ok as general protection to bottom part of seat, but it is very hard to clean itself because of all the rubbery ridges. If you want one, get the one that goes up the whole back of the seat."
4,Seat saver,"I bought 2 of these when we got new seats for our girls. I love them! They keep our seats from being completely dirty. They also help the seat grip better when being installed. We've used them on cloth interior and leather. Both work like a champ. My only minor irritation is that the part that stuffs into the fold of the seat is hard to get in...of course, part of that is my car. Overall, it is a very good buy!"
3,F1 technology book review,"This book is outstanding for the depth of technical information, and it is not surprising that SAE International endorse the book. Although now several years old, the book is just as relevant, and in fact provides discussion of a number of the very significant changes in F1 that may take place over the next year or so."
1,terrible book !!!!,"I hoped more illustrations in color like the Ferrari on cover. If you look for Technical aspects, drawings and illustrations in color about Formula 1 cars, definitively Giorgio Piola books are the better."
3,The strawberry is pretty sweet,"I've been a big fan of the Fruit and Nut bar for some time, but the Mixed Berry is overpowered by an overly sweet taste of strawberry. The Apple Cinamon's not too bad though.I keep a batch of these at the office as a top-up after cycling in each morning to bridge the gap to lunchtime. The fruits ensure that these are not too dry and you don't have to drink liquid with them."
3,Not as good as Fictional,"Another Funker side project which fails to captivate like the other side-project ( Fictional). This band sounds like Fictional it being a more synth driven. While funker sounds more hard edged,EBMish. The vocals arent done as well as with Fictional either. Yet they are better sounding than Funkers harsh distorted vocoder. All in all I would recommend any Funker album, or the first Fictional album (ficticious) over this one any day."
2,Pretty Bland,"A synth-pop side project of Funker Vogt. That's all right, I like synth-pop, but for some reason this just doesn't grab me like other synth/EBM bands (VNV Nation). It's just too repeatative. Aside from a couple slower tracks, most of the songs have the same beat. The vocals express no emotion as if the vocalist didn't really care what he was singing about. Other bands in this genre get past such problems through crescendos, decrescendos, rhythm changes, ect. but there's so few changes in any individual Ravenous song that this album pretty much bores me. Excuse me while I reach for my VNV albums."
3,One of the better ones in the Buck Naked series,"Julie Strain and Tamara Landy playing cards topless with three guys is pretty neat. And you have Tammy Parks getting nude in one or two western themed sketches that are not too bad. And Celeste is in it too, she is topless often. At least this one has some more famous people in it than the others."
3,Good quality with uninspiring writing,"This is a diy book teaching you how to write history. Required textbook for one of my class. But I actually dropped that class which is as boring as this book. It's really NOT a bargain to purchase this book at that price. Considering its content, it worths under 10$ at most."
5,Helpful Resource on Historography,"History prof recommended this for help in writing research papers in history department.Compact and inspirational, the author makes his points by way of examples and citations from historians. Passionate about his subject area, he communicates this well and infuses it into his observations and recommendations for writing about historical topics.While the jury is still out on my first paper to utilize this resource, I already know I am a better writer of history for having utilized this fine resource. Just the idea of grabbing your reader and making him want to read the rest was useful."
5,pyrex square dish,"Pyrex is a well known high quality dish that will last almost forever if you don't drop it. I've had mine for over 30 years and my mom gave me hers so it's even older than that. I got this one 'cuz i could always use another one and this comes with a cover. The cover makes it so much nice to use than to use glad wrap. Oven proof, microwave proof and i've put mine in the freezer."
5,good reasonably-priced item,I got this covered square baking dish to use with a casserole carrier that I already have. It works fine for the purpose and holds a little more than some others (deeper).
3,Ok for beginners,"This book covers different parts of SAP in a concise manner. But it is not a technical book at all! Provides a nice overview of the history of SAP, NetWeaver, and platform components. The mySAP ERP (which I was looking forward to reading) is all in one chapter.Not detailed at all. Good overview of many pieces of SAP. It is really for beginners/day-to-day users of ERP systems."
1,This book is really for DUMMIES,"This book is basically a high-level, marketing-oriented white paper. I don't think anybody should pay for this kind of stuff. If you want to impress your colleagues with SAP's Enterprise Services Architecture (ESA), it's OK to read it. It's SAP's blueprint for the future. If you are a technical person and wants to learn something useful, this is a waste money."
2,Not impressed...,"I thought that this would by similar to other ""Dummy"" books and was disappointed that there was very little ""how to"" information provided."
2,mySAP ERP For Dummies,I have used the mySAP ERP For Dummies for advanced knowledge for SAP. It is good for new information on SAP.
5,Cat story,"This book was very sad and depressing in parts, because it showed the cruelty of man towards cats and kittens. But it also showed the gentle and kind side of individuals who choose to love and care for their animals. It was written through the eyes of a cat, her life story from birth to death."
1,Too sad.,"I couldn't finish the book.It is written from a cat's point of view, which would be okay except it is a story of abuse and poverty."
5,Numero Uno,"Perhaps the best coming-of-age novel ever written.Didn't know young people came of age as described in this good, personable and fast moving book. (Feel like I missed out!!!)Great characters, great character development, great scenes and descriptions.You get to know these people,the young and the older ones, too. You celebrate and ache for them...You care about them, deeply care.An absolutely fine book.You won't want it to end...you'll be leaving your friends."
4,McMurtry's Best,"For emotional impact and believable characters and motivations, this is by far McMurtry's best novel. Lonesome Dove was more commercial, but then so was the First Wives Club and anything by Jackie Collins, so commercial does not necessarily equate with literature. Take this book for what it is and when it was written, don't judge it by today's standards (gee, not a car chase or devastating explosion in the whole book)and you'll find yourself believing in and caring for the wonderfully ordinary people populating this great book."
3,fair,"Not the best book I have ever read, not the worst either. Guess it falls somewhere in between. Does not come close to being great literature--then again, it would be unjust to call it [bad] work. Mildly entertaining, would be closer to the truth.See the movie. The black and white photography, small town feel and some of the performances (you choose) make the movie work better than the book (even though the flick itself is way overrated.)"
2,Not exactly my kind of coming of age journey,"I was less than swept away by this book. In fact, I didn't finish it, because I just couldn't stomach it. I guess playing pool, drunken Saturday nights, baiting the disabled, sex with heifers, infidelity and other gems are not my cuppa. I saw the movie years ago, but barely remember it. No wonder."
5,A classic tale of a small town losing it's innocence.,"This book should be read only in winter. It is not uplifting, but rather an interesting story of two friends that as theygrow older as teens grow further apart. The book is a study inthe futility of life and it's ups and downs. Larry McMurtryis at his best at character development in this book and thebook is well enough written to warent several readings."
4,texas soap,"I found this novel to be an easy and enjoyable read. I remember watching an edited version of the movie on network television many years ago. The novel covers a few additional characters than the movie. The novel mainly deals with the sexual escapades of the inhabitants of a small Texas town. This does not rank with McMurtry's best, Lonesome Dove and such, but it is a book you will enjoy as a touching, fun, and sometimes sad, journal of small town American life in the nineteen fifties."
4,We all know people like this ...,"... at least in high school. I thought Sonny a little depressing, but he is like so many I knew when I was a teen, it seemed perfectly normal that he was never really happy. Duane seems more focused, less prone to depression than Sonny, but he has a red-hot temper when it comes to Jacy, who doesn't love him but uses him nonetheless. Jacy is a snobby, conniving, user who wants out of Thalia so bad she can taste it. Her favorite past time is making her parents pay for living in a nowhere place. The adults are the most interesting people in the book, though. Sam the Lion, Mrs. Popper, the Coach ... those are the people you want to know more about but never really do.A great book for a rainy weekend."
5,No one does it better!,"Larry McMurtry is a master writer, and ""The Last Picture Show"" is an excellent example of his craft. The finely-drawn characters pull you into their world, which McMurtry illustrates with an eye for detail. You can almost smell the dusty air and feel the West Texas heat."
5,just read it,This is the first book I ever read that I could not put down. I have read it about five times and just reviewing it makes me want to read it again. McMurtry is one of my favorite authors and at this point in my life Lonesome dove is in my top five favorite books of all time and this book is in my top ten.texasville would have to be in my top twenty as well. I want to read duane is depressed and see if it lives up to the first two books. well bye read on my friends.
2,A poor follow-up,"If you have 'Beautiful Charade,' you'll understand why this album is a poor follow-up LP. There aren't any standout songs on this album, like there were on their debut. It quickly made its through my stereo."
5,No problems,"I used two of these to fix my DLP tv and they worked awesomely. IDK, you cant really screw up a capacitor I think."
3,Meaty,"Excellent tunes, meaty solo's, soulful vocals. A must for all blues collections. You will bounce and humm along with the songs. They are catchy and fun!! Enjoy!!!"
2,Low Marx for MCA,"Apart from the Universal horror classics, MCA Home Video cares little about its vintage film library. Why else would they release this slapdash DVD collection of the Marx Brothers' finest films. The ""extras"" are pathetic and the long-awaited restoration is nonexistent - especially on ""Horse Feathers"" (1932), which remains incomplete. If MCA had any integrity, they would recall this overpriced set and start from scratch."
4,The Marx Brothers,"I enjoyed them when I was a kid and I hope my grandkids will get as much enjoyment. If you like slapstick, these are the guys to watch."
2,Wonderful movies. Terrible release.,"Groucho would have been insulted at the lack of respect Universal has shown these movies.The packaging is elegant, which he would have loved, but abhorring superficiality, he would have been railing creative obscenities at the lack of care given to his legacy and our enjoyment.The lack of restoration, lack of commentary, minimal and disappointing extras, and ""collectible 40 page booklet"" which must have taken at least a half-hour to write (though much longer to lay-out..the graphic designer clearly cared) leaves me wondering if Universal has contempt for both its customers and its product.This is not the first Universal release which has left me feeling this way, and it is one of the reasons I own so few of their discs."
5,Marx Brothers Nirvana,"To have so many favorites in one volume is a real treat. The glossy, multipage booklet is a joy to look at, with quotes and some Marx Bros. trivia that will bring smiles for sure. A must for any Marx Brothers fan. The packaging is attractive and protects all contents very well. Look for a young Lucille Ball in ""Room Service,"" and settle down with some popcorn."
5,"Great, considering what Universal has","While the set isn't perfect, the new video transfers for all of the films but Animal Crackers are wonderful. They have beautiful photographic quality for the most part, even when the 16mm or dupe material is in The Cocoanuts. Universal really did a nice job of translating such tricky film elements into nice video. Animal Crackers has not been remastered like the other 4 films, oddly. It's interlaced, although, it still looks very good. It doesn't have the level of clarity and detail the other 4 films have.Supplements aren't great like Warner's set. I really wish Universal included commentaries for the films and even some shorts (like their Walter Lantz cartoons and other short subjects). But the films are so good, it's still worth it."
5,Laugh a minute riot,"Just perfect, couldn't ask for better!!!! Recommended for all ages. My four year old son and I can watch these over and over together and laugh and laugh and laugh."
5,One of the best comedy teams,My dad had introduced the Marx Brothers to me and my sister when we were little. When we grew up and actually listened to the punch lines we finally realized what the jokes were. They are jokes that make you think and are very clever. We had went to see a Groucho Marx impersonator whose name was Frank Farranti. He did really good he got everything down from his attire to his lines and motion.
2,"5 stars for the movies, 2 stars for presentation.","I've got better prints on VHS than this collection. I'm quite disappointed Universal didn't put more effort into finding the best copies available to transfer to DVD, when so many other studios send out their detectives to find the best prints available for DVD, let alone helping to preserve our film heritage. There's so many jump cuts in the films, I feel like I'm in a Communist country. Comrade Universal, I hope you're planning on a more definitive restored and remastered set in the near future."
2,Get with the Program,"Universal,I think that the box set I just purchased could have had a little more effort put into it. Just as you need to upgrade the W.C. Fields box set to include Never give a sucker an even break. Many of us out there have waited a long time for movies like these to be taken proper care of, didn't any of you hear what Mr. Sidney Lament said at the Oscars? Shame on you guys"
5,Margaret Dumont forever,Since there are zillions of reviews of this set I will stay with the wonderful Margaret Dumont. Next time you see the three films she is in just watch her expressions and put Groucho and his dialogue out of your mind. She simply cracks you up by just looking. This is especially true with Animal Crackers. She was simply the greatest foil in motion pictures and really makes these films classics. She was an actress for the ages.
4,Here's Hoping,"Here in the UK Paramount/Universal released all but one of the films (for some strange reason they left out COCONUTS). I didn't buy them as I had the previous Laserdisc/r1 DVDs. I may buy this new set if.....there is a worthwhile bonus disc, and if HORSE FEATHERS has undergone some sort of restoration (the scene in Thelma Todd's bedroom is almost ruined by damaged frames being removed and dialogue being rendered totally unintelligent)"
4,Music To Soothe Your Soul,Better Days is a collection of tunes that soothe my soul. The music is a beautiful work of art! The vocalists are supreme and the background vocals sound like angels. This is a must have album for the lover of soul music.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I AM A KOREAN VET AND I AM PROUD OF MY SERVICE TO AMERICAI LOVE THE COLORS AND THE WAY THEY ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THE FLAGAS WE ALL SHOULD BE SHOWING OUR LOVE FOR THE USA AS WE SHOW OUR LOVE FOR GOD,NO MATTER WHAT BRANCH OF SERVICE."
5,A great guide!,This is great information for someone wishing to avoid chemicals. It would also be a great help for organic gardening. It uses only basic home remedies that work.
2,Needed to have Big Kicks to do!,I'm 42 and would have had a hard time doing this video. I have 3 kids who love to exercise and dance and they haven't looked twice at this video. We were all very disappointed.
5,Great coverage,"This is really a great book on ""how to"" do a paint job on your car. I liked Boyd Coddington's How to Paint Your Hod Rod a bit better, but it has less scope than this book. It covers a new paint job, but this book covers everything...paint types, repairs, resprays and even paint care. A great book."
4,Good book -excellent overview,"This book is great for anyone looking to get started up painting cars, motorcycles, etc. I used this book and have saved a great deal on custom paint jobs restoring classic trucks and street rods. Well worth the money!"
1,Paint Handbook: Paint Technology for Auto Enthusiasts and Body Shop Professionals,"The description and a review or two state the book is ""revised and updated"" but the last revision was in 1998. I bit on this line, a mistake, since I wanted to know about current methods.Techniques change, materials and tools evolve. If you want info on the latest technology, pass on this one"
2,Disappointing...,"I was disappointed when reading this DIY paint book. While it does provide some background on paint, spray guns, techniques, tools, and painting, it lacks depth in any of these areas. Seems each chapter is really a high level view, but reading the author's background, he could have put more detail in the book."
4,Great Book to get youy foot in the Car painting door,"This book is both informational and entertaining if you have an interest in painting your own car/s. This is the first book I have ever picked up on automotive painting and it has paved the way for me. I will obviously use more resources, but this was a spectacular start."
3,"Book about ""paint"", but black and white pictures?",First impression from the book - is that all pictures are black and white and it does not help (cmon - this is a book about paint!). I will update the review once I finish reading the book.
5,Gorgeous!,"Traditional Celtic music, beautifully performed. Can't ask for more than that! Five stars all the way!"
3,Good product if you have solder skills,"I thought I could solder but while applying heat I broke the copper bands that connect to the circuit board breaking the razor completly and making the new battery useless. Take heed to the other comments regarding soldering. I just dumped everything into a plastic baggie and put it up on the shelf... if I actually believed in evolution it may repair itself - but I don't so I just went out and bought another Norelco. In 10 or so years, when the battery in it goes - I'll head to the store and buy another shaver. Good shaver but bad battery design ;-(."
1,Do not buy It,"Need to have solder/desolder skills to install battery into shaver. Original batteries come solder to cables. I was able to install the batteries, but not completely fix. After installing batteries the shaver worked like new, while the batteries were in contact with the not solder cables. At the end I bought a new razor XL9175 for $100, so I wasted $20 on the battery pack.Recommendation: Buy a new razor! Is the best and more money sound solution."
4,Original Space Lords,"An interesting album for Hawkwind, and one that must've come as quite a change to fans in 1974. After ""In Search of Space,"" ""Doremi Fasol Latido"" and ""Space Ritual,"" (all of which I'd give 5 Stars) this was a bit more progressive in terms of songwriting, and a bit less forceful in terms of sheer lysergic-effects pedal driven overloads. While I don't agree that this is Hawkwind's best LP, it is one of their last excellent albums (""Warriors on the Edge of Time"" being the very last of their classic United Artists album run).In case they ever re-release these records as domestic CDs, I'd rate them as follows:Hawkwind- 4 Stars In Search of Space- 5 Stars Doremi Fasol Latido- 5 Stars Space Ritual- 5 Stars Hall of the Mountain Grill- 4 Stars Warriors on the Edge of Time- 4 Stars(from that point on, I'm unable to advise)."
4,Psychedelic Warlords became psychedelic songcrafts,"The quality of this album is still as thrilling as their former classics (in search of space, Space Rituals, etc.) The song cycles are inspiring and impressive. However, we could saw a crisis that Hawkwind was beginning to repeat themselves (which later came true) and began to craft their songs instead of filling it with accidential muse. The songs are less intact, and we could see more ""individual works"" (like excellent solo Hall of the Mountain Grill, Goat Willow by the two Keyboard wizzard Simon House and Del Dettmar) but less fascinating collaboration, which is a trademark found in ""Space Ritual"". It seems that Hawkwind were beginning to degenerate. Anyway, it's still a great work in 70's work."
3,Good book,THis is a good book if only for the exercises it provides and its intructions on how to evaluate your own work which is especially helpful if you cannot attend photography classes and or workshops. The only thing it lacks is a clear way to interpet your progress after each exercise.
2,Not for the novice,"For such a small book (page-wise), it conveys an enormous amount of information. Each page contains a photo with a textual description of the design philosophy behind it.The concepts are presented quickly and without any extra frills. In many cases, I found myself overwhelmed with information without a great deal of elaboration, so the central concept of each photograph did not always come through clearly.I would recommend this book for intermediate photographers. If you're a novice, I would heartily recommendUnderstanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)."
1,Aviod this uninspiring ramble!,"I bought this book because of the catch phrase ""You can learn from this book"" that was sprawled across the back cover; I thought it would offer valuable tips about photographic composition. Such was not the case. I found it to be very poorly organized. It seemed like the author never stopped rambling on about his very uninspiring photographs. I couldn't decipher any meaning out of the excrutiating analysis he gave to each of his boring pictures! Avoid this uninspiring ramble; if you want a good book on photographic composition, keep looking."
1,Author is holding back,"I've read dozens of books on photography and this one has to be the worst one. Why? As a aspiring photographer, I wanted to improve my compositional skill. That's why I bought this book. Bill may be a professional photographer (not a great photographer though IMHO), but he's not a good instructor or writer. This book failed to be an instructional book because details are held back.For example, he said he learned a great technique by shooting both B&W and color film for the same subject, but he didn't mention at all what technique he learned!!! Why mention it if he's not going to share it? All the technique he talked about in the book are so basic and vague that I get more confused after reading this book. I remembered I learned a lot from John Shaw's and Art Wolfe's books (two of the best and great nature photographers in the world). After reading this book, my mind has become confused. So, I'm going to stop reading it after finishing half of it."
5,Completely revised edition of the best-selling classic,"During the 15 years since the first edition of Designing a Photograph was published, the field of photography has become more competitive, with much more sophisticated standards.This revised and updated edition of the classic manual provides all the information photographers need to bring their art to the next level. Filled with practical, real-life examples and excellent step-by-step exercises, this valuable illustrated reference demonstrates techniques of composition, color, lighting, perspective, and much more.With completely updated information and more than 150 brand-new photographs, Desiging a Photograph is easily one of the most important additions to every photographer's library.The perfect resource for amateurs, students, and professional photographers, Desiging a Photograph is filled with outstanding step-by-step illustrations and clear, informative text."
4,A Photographer's Toolbox,"What makes a photo work? What are the elements that catch the viewer's eye? Bill Smith, a working photographer, has captured this information in a great book. Through examples of Smith's work, he explains what went into each of the photos, what makes them work, and how the technique can be adapted by the reader. There are a number of books on creative techniques in photography, but the fact that this work is now in its second edition indicates that it has resonated with photographers. The high quality printing adds to the value of the book."
5,Crazy Graphics performance!,This thing in a Core 2 duo Rig will run all games available now at max settings. Its a monster(both in size and performance). Will see even more benefits when vista and DX10 games arrive.
4,Bigger than I expected,"I was in Iraq when I ordered this. Therefore, I won't comment on the ammount of time it took to receive, although as far as shipping in the United States, it was pretty quick. The only suprising thing was the actual size of the card, it's a lot bigger than any graphics card i've dealt with in the past. Takes up 2 expansion slots, and essentally, 2 PCI Express slots because of its size.Nevertheless, i've been incredibly pleased with the performance, running Command & Conquer 3 on the highest settings, or Day Of Defeat Source on the highest settings is a real treat. I couldn't imagine running this beast in SLI mode, although i'm certain it's a unique experience. And if I ever change motherboards, or get enough cash together to purchase another one, I may try it myself."
3,Very light racket but very flexible too,A good price for someone searching a very light racket with a lot of power. You should know that the racket is VERY flexible !!Enjoy badminton!
3,Only good thing: the graphics and the physics,"Ok, I'm 30 years old so dropping $20 on this game was no big deal, but this game is very very repetitive and requires no use of your brain. While the graphics and the physics are probably the best I have ever seen, the game is extremely boring. All you do is shoot monster after monster, and they are always coming at you, so don't worry, there is nothing to explore. If you like cool graphics and are easily amused, then you will like this game. I hope they use this engine to make a real game in the future. I'm sure it was a lot of work to get the engine as awesome as it is, but gameplay is no fun at all."
2,Disappoints,"Basic Game Design: Enter a room, be swarmed by monstersGraphics: Dark graveyard decor soon palls. Difficult to appreciate when you are being swarmed by monsters...Overall boring - no hooks in this game"
2,Heaven's hitman has no hands,"This game is most similar to Serious Sam than any other game I can think of except whereas SS is mainly in large open spaces with hundreds of opponents, this one is more commonly in large rooms with dozens of opponents. That's OK - it's pretty much what I expected.But what I don't like is the way you have no way to stack items except to repeatedly hit them randomly until they fall the way you want them. Then you better quick save because as soon as you try to jump on them they'll fall down and you'll have to start again. All the surfaces except the floor seem very slippery and moving on them is another exercise in frustration. I quit at the military base because I didn't spend $20 to waste 30 minutes randomly hitting tanks to stack them up so I could move on.Most of the secret locations and holy items are almost impossible to reach unless you are prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on it. I'm not - I have a life - and it doesn't include this stupid game."
2,ItsPainsMeSo,"This game has some serious issues. I'm experiencing so many problems to get this game to run. Also, it will locked up my computer when I exit the game to Windows. Just goes to their Dreamcatcher's website and see all the problems that some of the people are having. Hopefully, the fix that is scheduled for release on th 19th will resolve these major glitches."
1,What the hell is this????!!!!,"You gotta be kidding me... This is why I threw my DOOM game away! All this game is about mindless shooting! No plot to the game at all, just run around and kill things! Hey! I LOVE FPS but this is ridiculous! This is the first game I've bought in a LONG time that isn't worth the money. Oh sure, the graphics are ok, even a bit spooky, but geez, gimme a break! It must've been designed for mindless gamers without any other purpose other than to shoot things... What a waste! You go from one level to the next, mindlessly shooting creatures. Over and over and over again... Don't waste your money! Buy Far Cry. It's by far the best game out so far..."
4,Just below Doom 3,"I write only a few reviews, but feel that this is one of those ""hidden gems"" of a game that is getting overlooked or ignored in the glut of first person shooter games that are on the market today.This is not a team based, tactical shooter like the Battlefield games, Joint Operations, Ravenshield, or Counterstrike. Its just a simple ""shoot everything"".This game is a throw back (and I mean that in a good way) to the early days of First Person shooters. The game reminds me more of the original Doom than any other game out there, except with incredible graphics and an amazing ragdoll physics engine. I would have called this game the true successor to the original Doom except that there is a Doom 3 now (another great game).This game is made for single player, not Deathmatch (although there is a DM option). The storyline is far fetched, but then again so was Doom's, but that didn't stop the game from being addictingly fun, did it?"
2,Buggy but Fun,"I love the level design, the action, the graphics. It's just fun mindless killing. That would be great and all, but the game's save/load feature is riddled with bugs. I made it a point to install the latest patch (1.3) before playing because I figured the bugs it shipped with would be patched, but it still will only manage to load a save file 50% of the time. No, that doesn't mean I just have to retry twice for every save, it means on any given particular save, there will only be a 50% chance it's a good save, if it's broke it's broke, and will never load without crashing to desktop.The plus-side is you don't really have to save. Beating a level only takes about 30 minutes, and the next time you start the game you can go on to the next level. It's saving in the middle of a game that's the problem.Overall this is a nice change of pace from recent action games, and definitely worth a look. I can't edit my initial rating, but I think it's worth 3 stars, 4 if they fix the save bug."
3,Good game-back to FPS basics,"This review is based on the demo.Painkiller is an addicting and fun, albeit simple shooter. Watching an enemy fly into the air and then crash to the ground is hilarious (a bit demented but hilarious). Don't expect intelligent AI, think back to Doom or Wolfenstein 3D but with incredible graphics and great sound. An onslaught of enemies with plenty of ammo. Great game for those who just want to kill and blow stuff up without the extra sneaking and hiding. No complex puzzles or ""move the chair here...run along the top and jump to the banister while blowing a hole in the wall...crouch and you will find the secret weapon"" stuff, just all out in your face action."
4,Worth the money,"I have played both the demo's that can be downloaded from the internet and they are great fun. I will buy this game as soon as it hits the shops. The no-save option mentioned below is a demo glitch as in the city on water demo this is possible at any time in the game. It is a step up from Serious Sam and it'll be interesting to see how DOOM3 can improve on the engine, the imaginitive levels, the scary monsters and the sometimes hilarious animation. If you have the DOOM, Quake and Serious Sam titles on your shelf you will not be disappointed with Painkiller."
4,"Just what it sounds like, FPS killing the pain","I'll admit there isn't much plot or point to this game, but it does have mindblowing graphics,(just as good as DOOM 3). I don't know what all the bugs and patches are about that everyone is talking about. Hell i just upgraded my computer, i have an AMD Sempron 2800+ Processor, Overclocked to 2.0 GHz, 768 megs or RAM, and a GeForce 5200 FX Nividia Graphics card, and it runs Superb, no clitches and no sluggishness at (1024x768 resolution). I myself do like games better that have puzzles(example Resident Evil 4), and clues to find, but if you just wanna take out some aggression and just shoot your way through endless badies, turn out the lights and play in the dark with some loud 5.1 surround sound, you'll feel much better. So i agree but don't agree with most of the other bad reviews. Repetative yes, no fun, nope. Plenty."
4,Like an arcade version of Doom,"Straightforward first-person-shooter with lots of creatures to blast. PainKiller reminds one of the original Doom with hordes of creatures with one thing in mind --- your destruction. Once in a while there is a ""boss"" creature with exceptional stamina and killing power. At one stage, there is a giant after you in a graveyard. That giant is the largest creature I've ever seen in a game. Huge and powerful, with minion hordes chasing you too.Don't plan on a lot of strategy and hiding in this game. But, there is something refreshing in the simplicity of it all.Great escape game."
3,should have worked better,"This game had a lot of potential. It had an interesting premise, cool weapons, lots of bad guys, cool landscapes, etc.....But the game just didn't seem to work despite all the parts. The action was done in sequences, where invariably music will start and enemies will attack you. The levels don't have a lot to them, mainly involving killing enemies then moving to the next level. the plot also has a tendency to vanish at times.This is a pretty game and has some interesting parts, but just didn't keep me interested to the end."
5,Extremely Imaginative Fun!!!!!,"I just don't get the negative reviews here. This game is the most imaginative, creative, compelling and just plain fun in a long time. The graphics are amazing, the music is fantastic, and it is definately not repetitive or boring, as some have said. There are MANY levels to go through, and it is not all shoot 'em up, though that is the most fun. You have to find hidden items, secret areas, complete a level in a given time, etc.This game is the most fun I've had since the original Wolfenstein 3D, and that was a long time ago. I guess I'm more old school when it comes to gameplay. I enjoy minimal controls ( jumping, shooting, etc.) rather than all the hard to master (strafing, leaning, etc.) controls so I can ENJOY THE GAME.Forget Far Cry, Doom3.This is the one."
2,Falls short.,"This game can be only seen as a little appetizer for Doom 3 orHalf Life 2. Unfortunately the game falls short: it is repetitive, over priced, and has several bugs that the latest patch 1.15, as of May 14, 2004, has made even worse. No replay value because the plot/story is shallow. Do yourself a favor and buy a used copy, use it as a warm up for Doom 3 or HL2. If you pay out the 40 you will be regretting it."
3,goth/ industrial/ ambient soundtrack,"With this compilation of soundtrack pieces and remixes, Xorcist ventures even farther into the cinematic territory of Nomad. Though a far cry from the aggressive industrial/ electro-goth of earlier work, I&A draws one in with relaxing atmospheres, rather than the assault of earlier works. The songs of Insects and Angels reflect a variety of mysterious/ mystical moods; depsite being a compilation, the album maintains a smooth flow from track to track. A enjoyable mix of cybernetic new-age, darkwave, chill-out ambient, and ethnic sounds/tribal rhythms"
2,Too tough,"Since I really loved Buffalo Bill's Extra Smokey Links, I thought I would enjoy trying this beef jerky.Big disappointment. Way too dry and tough. Very little smoked flavor. Average ho-hum jerky taste. Buy Buffalo Bill's Extra Smokey Links instead!"
3,SALTY!!!,"Good flavor, good texture, decent price but my god...SALTY! I love jerky and make my own as well as purchase. Others have accused my taste as being on the salty side but this stuff was way to salty even for me.Update-Cho Cho snacks customer service contacted me to exchange for a substitute product to insure my satisfaction. A+ customer service! I will continue to purchase and enjoy their other products for sure."
2,Salty & Greasy,"I really like ChooChoo R Snacks Jerky, their quality is exceptional as I have stated in a previous review for their ""Big Slabs"" and their ""Country Cut"". But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste, it is absolutely salty, and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself, and far as smoky flavor is concerned, there is none I can taste,the jerky is also unusually greasy, really coated in grease to be factual. I will personally only stick with ordering their ""Country Cut"" and their ""Big Slabs"" where you taste the good flavor of the meat, and the jerky is moist, but NOT greasy."
1,Greasy mess,"The jerky is so greasy, if I want to eat a piece I am required to blot it with a napkin. Very gross! One star because all prior purchases have been very good and high quality."
1,"Very smokey, too salty & a tough chew!","There were enough good reviews to give this beef jerky a try.It comes vacuum sealed, which should make for a long storage life... until you open it. The bag isn't reclosable, so you need to transfer the contents to a reclosable container.This beef jerky comes in small pieces (strips), which we liked. The color is black, very black... thought this was odd? The smell is smokey... no beefy smell... not real appetizing.This beef jerky is ""tough"" & needs to be worked over (chewed) before you can enjoy the taste... that is, if you like very salty + smokey! Still... the meat quality is good, with little gristle or inedible pieces.We wanted to like this beef jerky, but it's down there with one of the worst tasting that we've tried. We won't be buying this beef jerky again!"
1,Low quality inferior product,"Half of the pieces of jerky had a funny taste. the other ""good half"" was bland. The quality of the meat was also very poor. If you want GOOD jerky, go for WILD BILL'S. Don't settle for this ripoffEDIT: There was a second label slapped on top of the old label, The second label reads ""Premium"" but the original DOES NOT.... Just something to think about"
5,What real jerky taste like,S what if it is salty it is jerky. Just eat a few pieces when you are out for a hike and drink your water. No need to eat a whole bag at once and OD on the salt
5,I like salty,"I'm known to be a salty person, so that may be why I like this so much. This is so much better than chewy jerky. I'd much rather have dry leathery jerky than chewy, greasy jerky. To me, jerky should be salty to help keep your sodium during a long trip or physical activity. I don't write reviews on Amazon much, but felt I should chime in on this product. Funny, but my local Sunoco station in Pgh carries this brand and it's the only one I buy, except if I visit my home state of Texas and go to Buccee's gas station where they have a full and I do mean FULL jerky deli style counter with all kinds of fresh jerky by the lb. It is a jerky lover's dream."
4,Excellent!,This beef jerky is full of flavor! It's the best I've had for the price. Probably going to order more! I don't think it will last long in our house!
1,"Too salty, doesn't taste like beef","I was really disappointed by this beef jerky, especially since I ordered a whole pound. The jerky is way too salty, so much that I worried about the health effects. Also, it tastes like it has been soaked in some kind of artificial beef broth that completely eliminates the natural beef flavor. What is the point of that? Why would anyone do that unless they are using inferior meat and looking for a quick path to flavor. Trust me, it's not worth it. Truly hickory-smoked beef just accentuating the flavor of the meat would be wonderful."
5,Worth a thousand words,"I've loved Eschers work since I first saw it as a teenager. I couldn't beleive this was only two bucks. The quality is very good, thick, heavy paper with a slight gloss. Very sturdy for a paperback and can hold it's own as a coffee table book. Nice enough to frame if you could bear to cut it up. Interesting background info on each print. It's arrival made for a delightfully lazy afternoon spent perusing the pages. Many guests have enjoyed it since. I wish I got that much value fo revery two bucks I spend."
4,"This is very nice, but...","I like this a lot, but sometimes I feel that the sounds they're making aren't at all 'happy' sounds, but rather sounds of distress. I'd very much like to where these dolphin sounds were recorded from."
5,My Favorite Sailor Moon Movie,"My main problem with the Sailor Moon movies was that they seemed like drawn-out TV episodes. However, Sailor Moon S The Movie was the only exception. First of all, this is the only episode where you can watch Luna turn into a human. Second, I do think Mamoru (Darien) and Usagi (Serena) are at their most romantic in this movie. Third, the Outer Senshi are here! What more could you ask for?! My favorite parts were when Luna asked Usagi (Serena) how she spends time with Mamoru (Darien) and when the Sailor Senshi were talking about Luna and Artemis got so upset that he left the room...you just have to watch it to know what I mean! If you're going to buy only one Sailor Moon video, buy this one! In fact, if you're going to buy anything Sailor Moon at all, start with this!"
2,Its ok ......,"I saw this movie and thought ""Ok thats nice but ..... there is just something missing"" I thought the video was a little BORING and was short on action ! The enemies were a little dumb ""SnowDancers"" ? Thats sounds just a little bit lame you know ? I saw the dubbed version so.....It might be a little different from the erm...undubbed one ! But anyways I thought that the movie was a little weird ! If you saw the last few episodes on SailorMoonS dubbed you would know what I mean ! the HolyGrail is destroyed ! And in the movie its still there ? And working ? And another thing ! Uranus,Neptune,& Pluto dont EVER join the Inner's in the S Season !! (again a dubby) This movie really lacks ALOT of well....shall we say ...planning ?"
5,The Outer Senshi Rule!!!!,"This movie is awesome! I haven't seen the Sailor Moon S series but I really enjoyed the movie. You don't have to know the plot-line of the series to completely understand the movie. They are totally seperate stories. Plus, you get to see the outer Senshi which alot of people in the US haven't. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think you should buy it. Go on- you won't regret it.P.S. Luna is soooo sweet!!!!!!"
2,Sailor Moon S is just a romance flick,Sailor Moon S among with the other sailor moon movies differ extremely from the regular storyline and in my opinion are less imaginative and certainly less etertaining. Sailor Moon S did have though a very nice romantic storyline with Luna falling in love with a human.
2,HMM..can someone wake me when it is over?,"*sigh* A waste of money in my opinion. The music was ok, but the villain! How WEAK! I loved Sailor Moon's crisis make up and the outers, but still. There was no action in between the main fights! It was all about LUNA. Too much nudity for my taste, for luna was shown naked... *shudders* But you should buy this anyway for a collecters item."
5,A must have for all Sailor Moon fans!,If you love Sailor Moon this is a must have! Finally people will hear the voices of Michiru and Haurka.
4,Not to bad...,"OK...This was the 1st Sailor Moon movie I ever saw. It really wasn't too bad. The plot was good as were the voices of most characters. The couple of problems with the movie are as follows...1) The snow dancers sound like puppies being clubbed and it gets super annoying. 2) The voices are great except for Sailors, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. When they go to attack, you can't make out what they are saying...especially Uranus. It almost as if she starts saying a word and then moans the rest of the time. Pluto is the next hardest to desipher. You can make out the first word she says and then it gets all slurred together. Other then these few problems the movie was great and I would highly recommend it!!"
5,A nice fix for the fans.,"What can I say? This movie rocks. It has all the things that makes Sailor Moon good... action, romance, good-looking girls... uh, ignore that last one...I recommend you watch this around Christmas... sort of a present for yourself. And sing along with the music. And do all the crazy gestures. Heck, just get into it!And if you can, get the subtitled version. It may cost more, but in the long run, you'll thank yourself."
5,Heart Warming,"Next to Sailor Moon R The Promise Of The Rose , i'd have to say Hearts In Ice is the next best thing. Not only because it has the outter Senshi , But the story is a tear jerker, It teach's you about love and pain and hardships. I think its deff a movie to see :)."
4,I like this movie!,The beggining of this movie is kinda boring. But the end is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cool!!! I like the music at the end!!
5,At Last! Some Movies!,"For the true Moonie, this is a must have. But for someone just trying Sailor Moon, especially after just watching only a couple of episodes, this may be a video that is hard to understand. An evil named Snow Princess Kaguya sets her hopes of freezing the Earth over. With the help of one her Ice Crystals, Kaguya can freeze the world over in a relatively short time. However, an astronomer finds the Crystal. The crystal then drains his life energy. Luna falls in love with the astrologer to such a point that she wishes that she would become human. When the senshi battle Snow Princess Kaguya with the Silver Crystal Power of Love and Friendship, some left over power grants Luna's wish.So you want to know more? Well, I suggest buying the video."
4,SAILOR MOON S,I LIKED SAILORMOON S BECAUSE OF THE ACTION AND IT SHOWS THE POWER OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.ONE THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS IT NOT BEING IN ENGLISHSO IT WAS IN JAPPNESS SO THE VOCIES WERE ALITTLE ANNOYING BUT THATS THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKEBUT THE REST OF IT WAS GOOD.
5,Good Movie,I have to say that this was one of the better Sailor Moon Movies. R was as well but i don't have high hopes for the SuperS dub. Any how I thought that the movie theme was well thought out and the relationship between Luna and the scientist is cute. I do have a few problems with this movie though. My first is Luna. I mean in the show and the movies she sounds like an old aged person not a teen girl. In this movie when Luna transforms in the Princess she looks like a 16 year old girl but she sounds 40! I ruined that touching part of the movie and made me want to laugh. The other problem i had was with Sailor Uranus! Lord my he have pity on her soul. I think i have never heard worse acting in my life! I know that she should have a deeper tone and i could bairly make out what she was saying! I took me 3 times watching the movie to figure it out! All-in-all it was a good movie considering they cut a lot of stuff out but i still recomend it!
2,Umm . . .,"I just got done watching the S movie, and I was slightly dissapointed. I mean, the outer scouts sounded to . . . I dunno, but they're suppost to be older than the inner scouts, not younger. And I noticed Haruka sounded higher and Michiru sounded lower. Got a mix-up? You bet. And that ""Mini moon"" thing? Uh, Hello! It just sounds to corny. Plus the whole thing sounded like they were acting, theey didn't have any feeling and it was weird. If you already have the subtitled S movie, don't waste your money."
3,Sailor Moon S Movie,"This, I have to say, was the worst SM movie. It had to little action, and when it did, it came to sudden. The story with Luna was pretty cute though. I personally think the enlish version is kinda funny. Especially if you have the DVD and follow along with the actual Japanese subtitles on bottom. The dialoge was fairly close. If you absolutly LOVE sailor moon,(like me^_^) then I'd recomend it, but if you're only into it a little, this might put you to sleep. -_-zzzzzz"
3,Okay for a dubbed tape.,"If you really want this tape, I suggest you get the subtitled version of it. I don't have anything against SM, it's just that the dubbed version...erks me. Because it's so heavily dubbed, most of the parts that tells you about what the Senshi are like at all CUT OUT! I wouldn't be surprised if people watching the dubbed version kept on saying that the Sailor Senshi are a bunch of bimbos with stupid powers! Seriously, though, I suggest you get the subbed than the dubbed, it's more entertaining if nothing else!"
5,Love It! Love It! Love IT!,"Hi! If you like Luna, and just plain love Sailor Moon, You'll adore this movie! There are great moments like Rei and Usagi having a red rasberry war (toungs sticking out at eachother), and when Luna is falling for the astronomer. It's got a lot of romance! Not any swearing that I noticed, not really nudity, just formless outlines... I really throughly enjoyed the film! and I loved it even more that it was in Japanese! That's it! I'm Off!"
4,Really Great Movie!,"I just watched it last night, and I was just like amazed by it. The enemy started to attack in the begging and I thought...Oh, it must be over soon. But I didn't now that it was only the first 20 mins of it. I liked it a lot! I think it had a very good storyline, besides what other people say. And I loved seeing the outers again. Unfortunately, I heard the scouts had new powers in this movie...but that is just a rumor. But I still just LOVED the movie. I recommend everyone to atleast see it."
2,Outer Senshi Flop and Sailor Mini Moon,"I thought the Sailor Moon R dub wasn't that bad. Not too much was changed, considering. I expected some changes concerning the outer senshi (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) in the Sailor Moon S movie dub, but I didn't expect it to be horrible. Until you see the first scene with Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna, it seems like a decent dub. The moment the outers get a scene and open their mouth to speak, I was horrified. Haruka with a high-pitched voice? And Michiru's voice sounding so VERY similiar to Haruka's? And what's with calling Chibi Moon ""Mini Moon""? I recommend either buying the subtitled version or if you have dvd, get that. Then you can have the subtitled version to switch to if the dub disappoints you as much as it did me."
5,I love it.,I love this movie. I can't get enough of it i just dislike the way they translated mini moon instead of small moon. Overwise I love this movie and I can't wait for Sailor Moon Super S to be dudded in to english.
5,The greatest movie of 'em all!,"K, so call me a hopeless Luna fan, but this movie is so cool! Besides the fact that it stars everyone's favorite feline, this movie also has a good plot. Definately the best movie of the three SM movies (SMR movie is a close second)! Oh, and watch out for a human Luna..."
4,Great for all Sailor Moon fans,"I must say I'm pleased to finally see the Sailor Moon movies in the U.S. I've seen all three movies, and while R is my favorite, I must say this one is just as good. If you are a Luna fan then you will surely enjoy this movie. I recomend it to any Sailor Moon fan!"
5,"This is for Luna fans,romantics,and any moonie!","This movie is soooo sweet.Luna as a human is really pretty too.But you feel so bad for Artimes,but everything turns out okay.(ahhh i don't wanna give any secrets away! )You do get to see the Outer Senshi which is cool.All the scouts also do this Silver Crystal Power of Love and Friendship and that scene is really cool. Chibi-Usa isn't really that annoying in this movie, but give her a break,she can't help being annoying all those other times :).But this movie is seriously very good and you should buy it or... For love and justice a pretty soldier in a sailor suit SAILOR SUN! IN THE NAME OF THE SUN YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED! so thats my warning....now go buy it!"
5,"Kindda boring, but hey, IT IS SAILOR MOON IN ORIGINAL JAP","I found this movie lakeing behind the R and SuperS movies when it comes to plot, but the animation was great and the ice dancers were wonderful. It is also original Sailor Moon in Japanese, how can you argue with that? I reccomend you buy this movie AFTER you get the R movie."
2,Good for the completist... Or Luna fan...,"This movie put me to sleep. Plain and simple. I found the plot the worst of the three movies. The first movie made you feel for the characters, and the third was just *fun*. This one, however, feels like a standard spotlight episode, doubled in length. Not a lot happens, and the villain is the garden variety I-will-do-something-evil-to-the-planet-because-I-Can type. Of course, it /is/ Sailor Moon, and it /is/ in the original Japanese (No name changes or odd edits! Rejoice!), so I'll probably buy it. Eventually. But not until I've forked over the dough for the other two movies first."
3,Sailor moon S movie - Dub,"Sailor moon S movie story is really cute and sweet how Luna falls in love for the first time (I think...) and wanting to be human.What I liked- The storyline liked I explained above its cute and sweet, really good artwork and you can see Luna as human.What I disliked about it- bad dub, the monsters make this weird sounds (annoying ones), its a dub think dic dubIf you're a Sailor moon fan I would rather go for the subtiteled version but then again this is a great story and its great if you have small children that like Sailor moon."
5,Sailormoon's power of Love,I Love this video sooooooo much! I want to see it again. Sailormoon and her scouts show all of there power to defeat the ice queen. Sailormoon finally show's her crystal to stop the ice queen from burying the city. And Luna likes somebody other than Artimis. This was the must perfect movie ever!
1,Badly Dubbed,Sailormoon s the movie is very nice but in the dubbed version its horrible they changed the music and cut some scenes ...sailorpluto sounds like a kid! she is suppose to be silent and quiet but of course DIC (...) like hell! and sailorminimoon? ok this isnt too bad.....get this in japanese with english subtiles forget about buying the english version.
3,Sailor Moon S.... This Dub Could Kill,"I had to sit through this twice (babysitting and I just had to get the kid hooked on Sailor Moon the week before) and I wanted to die... Its good in the sense that none of the scenes were cut out, but the voice actors are terrible. Some parts of it were translated funny or not very well. The music is okay but nothing like the Japanese Subtitled edition. Which by the way is offered on this site at a decent price, much cheaper then you'll find at a lot of video stores. It just does not match the Japanese version. Although if your buying this for small kids that don't know how to read subtitles then this would be a good thing for them to have. If your a fan of the Japanese version you'll find yourself yelling at the T.V. if your anything like myself."
4,Don't know which version to get?,"I happen to own both versions, dubbed and subbed on VHS. I have to say that it was disappointing to see certain scenes altered and removed, for there was more editing in this movie than the R movie. Comparing both versions, I like DiC's music, but it got too repetitive for my tastes. Since I found that Pioneer left in some of the original Japanese music, they should have left in the music for the final battle when the senshi used their special attack power.Otherwise, the scripts were VERY close to each other, so there wasn't much butchering. After watching both films carefully with observing, the sub wins (surprised?). Of course, it only wins because of the music. But DiC's music adds some more suspense to the dubbed version.You decide which ones you like best. I really enjoyed both the subbed and dubbed versions."
4,"A good love story, but not as good as expected.","Now don't get me wrong. This was a great love story, but just not what I expected from Sailor Moon. The story tends to skip around and the outer Sailors are rarely shown (what's up with them and that coffee shop?). The transformations are wonderful, but a tad revealing (think Barbie). The Ice Princess is a bit revealing, too (think super Barbie). Overall, it's a great movie for all ages.Suprisingly, Sailor Moon doesn't cry much in this movie. Luna finally learns what love feels like, leading to an interesting story. The end fight sequence is wonderful and well animated. Sailor Chibi Moon is in there, too, but not much, and doesn't do any fighting. A great movie, and a must see!"
4,Not as up to snuff of regular Sailor Moon quality,"I am a huge Sailor Moon fan, and this video 'almost' disappointed me. I liked being able to view Sailor Chibi Moon and the ""Outer Senshi"" but they hardly got chances to talk. I wish I could see Chibi Moon use on of her attacks, but that is absent also. It was interesting seeing Luna as a human, but besides that I really didn't really like it. I haven't seen SuperS yet, but I have R and I like that one more."
5,Sailor Moon S- The Movie,"This is My favorite movie of all time. The outer scouts did the best job. I love at the end how te Scouts helped Sailor Moon and Used te Silver Crystal power ( of love and Friendship). I ave seen this movie about 100 times++ Luna is So pretty as a human, and how she falls in love with Kakeru is so adorable. But in the end She and Kakeru found their equals and probably never saw each other again. there's really a whole lot more to the movie than that but you'll just have to find out for yourself. : )"
5,"A Picture is worth a 1,000 words, this dub cuts out 1,000","You have to buy the subtitled version! The dub is cute for little kids who can't yet read, like my little sister loved it, but for any true fan, you must have the subtitled version, it is more romantic, the music is better and it is just better all around."
5,Sailormoon S,"I LOVE this movie! I got it as a gift from my mother. The *nudity* in this movie is as one would see a Barbie doll, anatomically incorrect. So, these kids are going to see nudity sometime in their life, they might as well see it now, because if you raise them like that they will grow up being afraid of their own bodies, and thats not good. Back to the movie. Its so great! So much better then the DiC dub. I loved SailorNeptune and SailorChibiMoon, they were always my favorites! And they were BOTH in the movie, I was so happy! Anyways, Luna has this very beautiful crush on an astronomer, and it is so heart-wrenching to see her cry...Any Sailormoon fan would love this movie. I know I did."
5,Best SM Movie,"This is the best one hands down! Now, I wasn't quite convinced of the until about halfway through the movie. Take into account Fiore in R. Best villian, hands down. Pupuran is another good one. And the snow princess is not. And her little snow dancers' screeching can get on your nerves after awhile. But then there was Kakeru and Luna. It's so sweet. And Hime is actully covered. Yes, that's right, she's modest...a nice change of pace.So, it's story was not the best, but there are two things that sent it to the top of the heap: 1) three words...OUTER SENSHI TRANSFORMATION! I had never seen them before this, and I'm a much bigger outer senshi than inner senshi fan 2) Double credits! What that means is that they play the Japanese credits (while you can sing along phonetically on Japanese), and then go abck and play a translated version of the credits! (meaning you not only get all of the information you want, but you can sing Moonlight Destiny a SECOND TIME)"
4,Super Sailor Moon Movie,"Sailor Moon S is a sweet movie with a few corny moments. I absolutely enjoyed it however.Sailor Moon S is mainly about how Luna the cat falls in love with an astronomer named Kakeru. This makes Artemis the cat sad and a bit depressed. Meanwhile, an evil ice queen threatens to take over the world with her ice minions. It's up to the sailor scouts to defeat them."
3,....,"Personally I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. I mean, it wasn't bad as far as dub is concerned, but it was still pretty bad. First of all I found Michiru-sans voice very unrealistic. Second, I thought that a few of the Japanese songs would have been more appropriate, but they atleast left 'Ai No Senshi', which helped a little. However this wasn't half as bad as Sailor Moon SuperS, that was horrible. Luna's old-english type voice was annoying, and the fact that they cut out the part of her transforming into a human severally P.O.ed me. Like I said at the beginning this wasn't bad for a dub, but if you can read than I wouold suggest the subtitled."
4,How does A Cat Love?,"Hi, I have Sailor Moon VHS (Im stilling trying to get a DVD) SO the movie was okay....I mean I was extra excited to see the Outer Senshi for the first time since I didn't have money to get subbed. It was a very cute movie about how Luna had a crush on a human and how Artemis was trying to win her heart. It was amazing at the end thats all I can say for those who haven't seen it. And it was nice to see the Inner Senshi and the Outer Senshi get along. (Although they didn't have a big part!) The movie was mainly based on Luna The cat and her feelings towards this human who saved her life and how she wished she didn't have to be in a 'Cats Body' so that she could actually have a chance with him. Finally Luna gives up and sees that she has another admiror...Artemis. Its a cute tale but mainly based on Luna. I would reccomend you buy it and rate it yourself. I hope this is enough information for you ^_^"
4,It was pretty good.,Now I've never wacth the orignal subtiles but I think this is pretty good for america. You could really fill the love Serena has for Luna. Also the ending is very cute I love how Artimes tells Luna how he fills! It's so cute! Also I has my fav. Sailor in it Uranus. So that's cool. It also for once has the Sailors getting knocked around to give it a more real placement! I also like it when Darien and Serena kiss for once a romance between them! Over all it's pretty good. Only bad part is that they cut out some parts with them shopping and Mina bening Mina. That sucked. But other then that it was ok!
4,My point of view,This movie is the best Sailor Moon movie that I have seen. Itis based upon how Luna and Artemis become a couple. At the same timeit has plenty of action it it. Luna falls in love with a young man that finds a crystal from outer space. The crystal somehow makes him very sick and almost kills him. The outers show up for the first time. This is why I like the movie so much. Another is because I just like Serena and Raye get into those tongue fights.
5,A romance even guys will like!,"I have seen the Jappanese version of this video and I have to tell 'ya, it is the best. I'm a 14 yr. old male and I love this movie. It's the best SM movie so far. If your a huge fan of SM, you gotta get this video. It made me sad in the part where Luna... FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF! It's a great movie that will make you laugh. For some of you it will make you cry. I highly suggest buying this video. It's a great movie that anyone could love."
4,It's Great... if you have an attention spane,You have to be able to sit down and watch some storyline to last through this movie. Although there is a good amount of action (nothing like R) there is much more storyline. It also losses touch on how Artemis feels for he doesn't say more than 5 sentences through the movie. You may need to see this movie more than once to understand it. Demo it's a kirei kakoi movie!Ja ne'Arigatou for your time
4,"Half good, Half bad","The good guy - bad guy part of S was the weakest of all three movies. But the love story between Luna and the astronomer makes up for the other let down. The love part of the story shows a sweet and romantic side to Luna that we've never seen before. I'd suggest buying this movie only for this reason. If you're looking for quality fighting, buy R."
5,This was my favorite Sailor Moon movie,"I love the outer senshi and the story of Luna is very cute. It is also animated better than the SMR movie, making it look better and seem to be a better movie."
3,pretty good review (subtitled version),"If you are really into sailor moon, and know what has happened before this than I recommend it. If you are pretty new to Sailor Moon, and want to learn more about it, don't get this vidio, it will confuse you, bore you and leave you thinking ""What is going on! "" If you know a lot about Sm, and are familiar with the charaters and earlier plot, Than I still don't highly recommend it. It has a very slow start, and dosn't grab your attention in the begining (has proven to put people to sleep)But after the bad-guys are introduces, than it get's intresing."
3,Outer Scout voices? Come on!,This movie was pretty good except the voices of the Outer Scouts? They were so bad and the way they crammed in their powers especially 'Uranus World Shaking' I mean please people! They also should have used the Japanesse Music for their transformation...that music is way more exciting. I was very dissapointed about the way they did Pluto especially for she used to have the best 'Dub' voice in the episodes. On a different note I found it sad. Also to see Super Sailor Moon talk in English was really good. I really like SM but I hope that they don't wreak Super-S ' Black Dream Hole' as well!
4,Sailor Moon S Hearts In Ice Dub,"Okay I bought this movie and then I watched it. I loved the plot and there were things wrong with it! I hated the fact they called Sailor Chibi Moon Sailor Mini Moon. Chibi means Small or Little. Thats why her name is Chibi Usa in Japan. It is Small Usagi or Small Rabbit. Sailor Uranus and Neptunes voices are messed up. They are supposed to make Neptune more feminine and Uranus more Masculine. Plutos voice was different too. They had shown Pluto once in the episodes. Her voice was perfect and now It is so different. And did anybody catch Mina saying My bad? Mina is not a ""homie"" from the city!"
3,This is a cute movie for Luna fans,"Any fan of the relationship between Luna and Artemis must see this film. Luna actually finds another love interest and it is a human! Talk about your messed up cat. Luna longs to be human and she cries when she realizes that she is only a cat and cannot help her love interest Kakeru. The movie is cute and if you are a big fan Luna you will definately want to see this one. I recommend the subtitled version though. I just hate it when they add stupid lines that are not in the original (""She's no Venus DiMilo."")"
2,ummm....i love sailor moon...but...um...,"Ummm....some of the voices were really horrible, and the transformation music stunk. bad. but I am sure the Sub-titled is much better. the good thing about it, was the animation, and also the action, it was nice to see the scouts fighting for a change instead of using one attack and then giving it up to sailor Moon. it was also nice to discover the relationships between Luna and Serena, they are usually crabbing at eachother in the cartoon series. but it dragged on at some points...I would recommend buying the R movie before you buy this. This is better than the first SM movie though!"
4,Pretty Good!:),"I liked this movie even though I think I'll like the Japenese version better.It is is about an evil ice queen who wants to freeze the Earth.I was touched when Luna cried and Serena[Usagi in the sub.]told her everything would be okay.It is a touching and cool movie.It also has Sailor Uranus,Neptune,and Pluto in it.I would recommend this movie to kids 4 and up."
3,Complete,"This movie is complete from top to bottom. All the characters appear in it, plus the dialogue is dramatic and funny."
5,If you are a Sailor Moon fan you will LOVE this movie!,"This was a totally cool movie, the best one I've ever seen! i think it is sooo sweet how Luna falls in love with that scientist guy. But the only thing is that i felt so bad for Artemis. So, the main deal is that if you are ANY tpe of Sailor Moon fan, you'll love this movie!"
4,Excellent stuff!,"I own both VHS versions of this dubbed and subbed movie, and I have to say that they're both really great! The dub does take out a couple of scenes, but the cuts are rather questionable. I did like the dub, and along with everybody else, I didn't like the Outer Senshi's dubbed voices. The script was very close to the original, and the music was pretty good, too!This movie is great, and it's suitable for everybody, get it!"
5,Beautiful story!,"Luna fans will love this movie! The storyline is extremely sweet, the kind of thing that makes you go ""aw..."" all the time. For once it puts the kind and gentle black feline in the spotlight and reveals her true nature.I will admit that the graphics aren't quite as well done as the R and SuperS movies, but they make up for it by having the original full transformations of everyone, even Chibi Moon! Some find that the R movie was superior because it had more action than S, but this movie had a much more well-developed storyline. This is defenitely something that you want added to your collection!In comparing the three Sailor Moon movies, I have come to this conclusion. R has the best music and action, S has the best story, and SuperS has the best graphics!"
2,Subtitles were MUCH better..,"At a friend's birthday party, my friends and I had rented the dubbed Sailor Moon R and S movies from our local movie rental store. Already owning the subtitled R, S, and SuperS movies, I could tell there were many many differences. first of all, they could have done better with the outers' voices. The dubbed movie was exceptionally good with their attack names and the edited stuff--there wasn't much missing. If you want to experience true anime, I'd get the subtitled movies. If you're a bit younger, and aren't aquainted with cursing or partual-hentai, get the subtitled movies."
3,"WTF! Sub good, dub forking horrible!",I bought this movie dubbed and i didn't really like it. It was Luna's voice didn't fit the character. I didn't like the outers voices either. And I thought some of the lines were bad. So I went back and got the sub. And wow! I never knew what I was missing! The sub was excellent! The music was awsome! I love Sailormoon's japanese voice! The outers sound cooler! I'm so glad I got the sub! I just ordered the R and SS in subtitles. The subtitles are so easy to read! and the dialogue is 100% better. I now do NOT want the rest of the series dubbed! I couldn't stand to see Sailormoon fall anymore! I am looking for the series in subtitles now! i HAVE FIANALLY SEEN WHAT i'M MISSING!
5,Sailor Moon,This movie is cool. It has all the Senshi execpt Saturn. I thought Luna falling in love was so cool. I love the way she transformed. I recomened it to any sailor moon fan.
5,Sailor Moon S Movie,"Sailor Moon S Movie is so cool! It's got a good plot and I didn't have stuff bening MISSDUDDED.It's very good,but the sub-title can be hard to follow and the breif mild nudity is not good for LITTLE KIDS."
1,What did these people do to this movie?!?!,"When I first saw this movie on the shelf at the movie store, I decided to rent it. It had terrible dubbing (ever seen a Godzilla movie?), Sailor Moon`s voice screeched, and it was so boring! The American Voice actors had NO emotion in their voices, and It was edited to peices. I own the Japanese versions of the series S, and all the movies. I KNOW what quality acting is. And this is far from it. It you even consider buying this movie, GET THE SUBTITLED VERSION. THE JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS ARE MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL, AND THEY CERTIANLY ACT BETTER. Arigato for listening. Ja ne!"
1,Horrible!,"The movie dubbed was horrible! The outer senshi sound like freaks! Mini moon, pioneer must not do any reaserch on nemes, hillbillies refer to their kids as mini's! Like say someone's name is Joe, he would call his kid mini Joe! Rainbow moon porridge reform? What does that mean? Luna's voice ruined the entire movie! It sounded like an old lady was in love with a 20 year old!"
2,A list of complaints...,"1st complaint: the annoying voices. 2nd complaint: the editing. 3rd complaint: Uranus should not sound feminime. 4th complaint: Mini Moon! 5th complaint: Luna's british grandmother voice. 6th complaint: Lousy ""american"" backgroung songs. 7th complaint: Pluto does not ""shout"" her powers. 8th complaint: Terri Hawkes needs voice lesson. 9th complaint: Voice actors are trying too hard. 10th complaint: Cheap ending song. Why couldn't they leave in Moonlight Destiny? 11th complaint: Get Toby Proctor back to do Tuxedo Masks voice again. 12th complaint: Pioneer and Optimum productions never listens to the fans opinions or complaints. 13th complaint: Not too thrill expecting the next movie (Sailor Moon SuperS) coming soon."
1,Terable! Terable! Terable! Terable! Terable Dub!,"I loved the subtitled vertion of this movie, but when I bought the dub of this movie...I was shocked at had bad it was (I didn't think Pionear could mess up a dubbed movie any more than they did with ""Sailor Moon R.""). I hope DiC changed the voice for Haraku and the rest of the outer scouts for that matter (Was it just me, or did they ALL sound the same?). Those voices didn't suit them (Or any of the other new charicters) in the movie. I hate to say it, but even the american voices for Serena and them got on my nerves after awhile. Not once did I feel sorry for Luna with that stupide voice (I had the exact oppisate in the sub) when she relised she would never get together with that guy. The story was tuned down too much. And Mini Moon? And they think 4Kids Entertainment (Pokemon) are the only ones that come out with stupide names. Get the DVD or subtitled vertions. They will please you more than this piece of junk."
1,Grrrrrrr >:-P,"I hate DiC for what they did to the REAL Sailormoon! The dub is horreble. If you really want to see Usagi and crew in action, buy the subtitled!"
4,R or SuperS are Better,"Beautiful artwork and character designs, the Sailor Moon S movie is certainly nice to watch. (The cute love story was nice, too.) However, if you are looking for a really good Sailor Moon *story*, the S movie is rather weak on plot."
4,Sailor Moon S DVD,"Absolutely fantastic! Any anime lover will want to get this one. But for the love of god, DO NOT watch this movie with the English dialogue. I've always been an advocate for Japanese seiyuu in anime. This movie goes to prove my point. The english dialogue is incredibly cheesy and out of place. Several obscurities that occur in this movie: 1) ""mini-moon""? 2)Michiru with a masculine sounding female voice?... 3)Haruka with a more feminine voice than Michiru. So please, buy this movie but DO NOT watch it in english."
2,What happened......,"I only have two words to describe this...Poor Uranus. Poor poor Uranus. They totally ruined her voice. It's way to high and doesn't suit her at all. I am not pleased on how they dubbed Pluto's attack. Instead of whispering it she now yells it. The whole reason that attack was cool is now gone. The dub voice for Luna did not fit this movie at all. Especially when she was in her human form. It was a teenage body with a much older sounding voice. The original VA's where there for the inner senshi, so that was cool. I can understand Sailor Mini Moon. But don't change Sailor Moon's attacks, that was pretty lame. I recommend this movie but in it's subtitles version."
3,"Oh, my lord!","Great. Just great. Welll, you know I'm going to rag on this movie. Well, at least we got to hear what Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto's voices are like in english although I preferred Pluto's show voice better than this one. I was terribly disappointed by Haruka's voice. She sounds wat, way, way too feminine. And Neptune...that was Usagi's mom from the english dub! Oh, come on. And Luna's voice could have been changed. Also, they cut out some of the best parts in the movie. I mean, come on PIONEER! You know we moonies love the SMS characters, but did couldn't you have done research on the people before you put it on the video. Geex. I mean, come on. Mini Moon 'stead of Chibi Moon."
4,Subbed part -Excellent...Dubbed Version? - Well....,"Ok, I have the DVD version. The subbed version has nothing wrong with it, so I will leave that alone. There is some problems with the Dubbed Version(Isn't it always...). I will agree with previous reviews that the Voice of Salior Uranus is too high and needs to be masculine. However, the culture in Japan is that when someone is translating the work into english, the voice needs to be a higher pitch. I think Pioneer did this by culture standards, which needs to be changed. I think I can live with Mini Moon. I would have like for them to keep Chibi Moon. This DVD does have the orginial music which is a MAJOR plus in buying the DVD version. All in all, it's ok. Change Uranus's voice before the dub!"
5,A travel down memory lane,Well worth the money. The story lines are still as valid now as they were back then. And the acting is still as good as you would expect in this type of show. But it's great to watch a program where there's no FBI or CIA or terrorist plots or cops killing other cops or anti-heroes ... where the good guys are unmistakably the good guys and the bad guys always get it in the neck. And the hero isn't ruled by sex!Thank you for making this available.
4,Have Gun - Will Travel,Excellent Quality and sound. Just like orginally shown on TV -- even better! Highly recommended !!
5,HGWT Seasons 1-3,"Video quality is excellent. Story lines hold up well. Richard Boone is magnificient. Only one problem: after you finish seasons 1-3, you'll want seasons 4-6 and they are not available. That's a really bad decision on someone's part."
5,Joe from Wantagh,I would highly recommend this dvd collection. HGWT was ahead of its time then and still holds up today. Richard Boone played a very believeable character. He was a man's man.
1,Where's the rest?,"I echo my fellow reviewer's praise over this superb series, which starred probably the most craggy-faced actor of all time (these days it would have to star some pretty-boy!). I remember watching this series late at night when I was a kid, hoping my parents didn't realise I was still up! In the UK we probaly didn't get all five-six(?) series, so come on Paramount (or whoever owns you) let's have the remainder. Not just so us 50 - somethings can wallow in nostalgia but also so that younger viewers can see some decent, non-soap, TV acting for a change!"
3,"""Keep the line straight, boys!""","These were the last words spoken by an officer to his men before their execution by a German firing-squad...Trevor Howard was a devoted officer and a gentleman, never afraid to give his life for his country... Howard was a great character actor with a big presence on the screen in many good films as ""Mutiny On the Bounty,"" ""Ryan Daughter,"" and ""Gandhi.""The motion picture deals with the silly mission of ten British Royal Marines, who after embarking a submarine from the English Channel port of Portsmouth traveled by flimsy canoe into Bordeaux harbor, southern France on the Garonne River, blowing enemy ships by attach limpet-mines..Directed and starred by Jose Ferrer (1909-92) star of ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" and photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor, the film succeeds in reflecting the brave deed of the English Commando and is somewhat exciting and tense in its depiction of the hazardous journey into enemy territory in World War II..."
5,Good resource for school and performers,"Organized from easier (songs within compass of a 3rd and 4th) to more complicated (songs within a 9th). Notes and sources listed at end of book, bibliography, title index. Songs from various states and Native American songs."
5,injecting responsibility into feminism,An excellent book blending anecdote and evidence into a strong argument. An attempt by a feminist to tinject responsibility and morality into a movement that has often turned its back on both.
1,An excellent example of deceptive tactics,"This book is a great example of the tactics used to bash women and feminists. It relies heavily on percentages without giving the reader the raw numbers, and it selectively quotes primary sources without giving the reader entire passages that contradict its central tenet: OMG, we gave women a little power and they're taking over. Its greatest flaw, however is the way it fails to compare male crime rates and female crime rates. The stunning jump in crime percentages is possible only because the raw figures for women's crimes were so low to begin with. Rather than raising an alarm for this, a more productive approach would be to ask why women in fact so many fewer crimes than do men.In sum: typical backlash literature, trying to prove that women are just as bad as men are. Reputable research says otherwise."
5,Kate is a Winner,"Kate Huntongton never fails to delight with her Regency lovers! They're real - and ACCURATE. Think of all the heroines actual and fictional who exchanged letters with gentlemen without being engaged, who removed tea time dishes, and traveled about without chaperones! In spite of the crank overtones that have grown up surrounding the genre, author Huntington remains true to the wit, sly social satire and sheeer goodhumored romance of that Great Mamma of Regency Writing, Jane Austen. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Delightful Story,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable book. It didn't have the passion that ""The Captain's Courtship"" did and there were a few too many characters to follow but it was definitely a good book. I found myself laughing out loud and cheering Lydia's no-nonsense manner. And Edward was just as likeable. I look forward to reading the next book in this series of the Whittaker sisters."
3,Was I reading the same book???,Although I'd like to rate it lower I can't do that because I only read 1/3 of this book. I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it got better which I'm sure it must've since the reviews are so high but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe a big turn off for me was the fact that this couple was cousins. I know that's how it was back then but still it kind of creeps me out. I will admit that I can usually put that aside & get into a book but just not with this one. I read about 60 books a year & it's very rare for me to not finish one if that tells you anything. Sorry to say that this is not a book that I will recommend.
1,Don't Bother Buying It.,This was a waste of $5.95. It doesn't contain much information it just lists what individual campers brought with them on their motorcycles. There is much better information on various web sites and it is free! Don't waste your hard earned money. I took the hit for all of us. :)
5,lisabee32,"All of DE Stevenson's books are like a breath of fresh air. They are charming life stories about the people of Scotland. Anyone who enjoys Barbara Pym, Rosemunde Pilcher or Ann Purser would enjoy DE Stevenson."
3,I guess it's OK,"After reading this book it re-affirmed all I knew about drug and alcohol abuse with loved ones. The book helps to understand and give some helpful advice but the program at the facility cannot be worth 29,000.00"
1,not worth it,this book was unimpressive to me. just a waste of money as very little in it is of much use.
3,Can be costlu,"I really think that this program can work, but with all of the counselors and Psycologists that are required, this is a very costly process."
2,Addiction cure,"I do believe in a holistic approach to recover from addictions, but the author seems to think we all have enough money to get together a team of doctors to help us. Not so in my case."
2,Entertaining but beware.,"[...]I am a holistic practitioner and deal with addictions.While I was reading the book I thought it was good and it offered some very good advice. Then I discovered the truth: This book is one long advertisement for Passages, the author's insanely expensive addiction treatment program. At $55,000.00 a pop for one month's worth of detox (which is not guaranteed) who can afford this but the rich and privilaged? Any program that cannot serve the masses is not for me. Also, Mr. Prentiss keeps bragging about his success rate. Well, of course. Why else would anyone shell out $55,000.00 a month? I may know why. After paying $55,000.00 who has money to buy drugs?"
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is advertised constantly on TV as an alternative to the AA way of addiction problems. I was curious so i bought the book only to find that ""yes"" it is an alternative but only if you have thousands and thousands of dollars to spend on accupuncturists,therapists,someone to give you a new diet etc. Of course if you want to find all these people in one place you can go to the authors addiction palace in Malibu. I have been in AA for years and they have never charged me a penny. The AA way is much better and who cares if i have to categorize myself as an alcoholic? The book is a ripoff unless you're rich and can afford all the treatments recommended in the book."
1,"""This is not another 12 Step Program. This works!"" - Chris P.","This book is NOT the alcoholism and addiction cure, in fact it is an advertisement for Passages Malibu! Addiction and Recovery that hits main stream media seems to always have a lack of integrity. There are only a handful of Recovery Programs and Sober Livings that do true honest work, and sincerely care about helping their clients. It's not just a money game. Thats why 12 Step recovery programs are so widely successful, because they are generally built on helping people, no costs, no memberships, and no fees.As far as recovery programs go, I would suggest anyone visit [...]. They have long term structured sober livings, offer help for women and will help you find the right place to help address the individual's therapeutic needs! Check them out."
1,B.S.,"Save your time! Save your money! Maybe 100 pages of content in a 316 page book. 85 pages of author's pampered son's escapades in addiction, which border on bragging. 76 pages of questions and answers. Come On!!! One can only hope that the California treatment center is better than the book!"
3,my short review,"It seem to be promoting there facility all the time .got very tecnical and boring later on .The first part about pax was written well , but after that it got boring ."
1,Fugetaboutit,"First get four more copies to give to the people you're supposed to round up to help you, since they too need to read the book--if only in order to help you. And so on and so forth...they promise.Promises, promises.P.S. Sorry, I meant to add that I first heard of this book by constant ads appearing on CNN, to which I'd become addicted. Talk about your painful addictions! (I'm kidding, though not about the banality of both this book and CNN.)I'm proud to announce that I've broken my addition to CNN, having not watched so much as a single minute in three months. Nor have I cheated by tuning to MSNBC or Fox, like I'd ever so much as spot myself watching Fox! Alas, I broke the addiction without ever getting any help from the book at hand. The curious thing, however, is that I did exactly what the book recommends--just broke it off.Course I wasn't really addicted to CNN, but just had it on all the time in the background. Big difference I don't think these authors really understand."
2,May not be useful to all...,"Too much detailed testimony. There may be more to the cure than is described. The flavor seems to smack of an entrepreneurial approach to recovery. In recovery myself,I am of the opinion that it would take an extraordinary individual to succeed using this method on their own (as the book alludes to)."
2,NOT WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT...............,"The title leads one to expect more from this publication than they should. The main message is that it is most important to identify the actual reasons for alcholism and addiction, then deal with the healing. There is lot of sound advice about what to do and what kind of medical help and therapy to seek. But there is also a lot of California ""holistic"" babble about ""Traditional Chinese Medicine, spirituality, yadda, yadda.... and an obvious and tedious campaign for their (very expensive) program at Passages.Way too much information about Pax's problem, you could skip Chapter 3 completlely, unless you really want to learn all the sordid details of one person's relapse after relapse.I believe that some people could benefit from SOME of the book, but if you expect what the title implies, you will be indeed disappointed."
2,Read the First Six Chapters,"Read the first six chapters. Then, throw the book away. I guess hope does spring eternal. I am sure that a lot of troubled people really hoped that there would be an answer in the book. While there is no ""answer"", it does provide a glimmer of hope for those poor souls who have been brain-washed into thinking that their situation is hopeless unless they walk around all day saying that ""I'm an alcoholic"", or ""I'm an addict"".Also, the re-emphasis that there is an underlying cause for their dependency may be useful to some."
4,The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure,"As a hospital/hospice chaplain and addiction counselor, I have experienced the deadly effects of addiction and appreciate many of the whole and healing approachs of Chris Prentiss. I finally see in print what I have been trying to instill in patients and clients."
1,CURE?,"I'll make this simple. The program promises to ""cure"" alcoholism but after you are cured they say you can never drink again- ever. So how is that a cure? To me a cure means you can drink responsibly like none alcoholics do.Abstinence is not a cure and is no different than what the 12 step programs promote only cheaper. One more thing - unlike other established rehab programs - this one does not have licenced doctors or psychiatrists working at their facility. The are not licenced by the state of California to practice medicine."
1,What a crock!,"How can you ""cure"" what is NOT a disease?!? I tried holistic, psychological, religious and ""behavior mod"" attempts to get sober for 8 years!!! They nearly killed me! Until I accepted that I could not accurately and consistently predict the outcome of any ""drinking episode"" (ie I am powerless...) I continued to attempt to control my drinking. Accepting my condition enabled me to begin to deal with it effectively. I have 22 years sober! This is a fancy book to sell a $50,000.00 a month TREATMENT program that is NOT based on the latest research! Do not be fooled by good marketing, hype and drummed up controversy!"
1,It's a scam!!!,"This book is a scam, the author does not delivered the name of the book, it tells you to go to one of their rehab centers, I bought it and I feel a fool for believing about this book, there is nothing that teach you about curing yourself, it tells you to go to a rehab center, you don't need to buy this garbage book to know that. I wish they would take this scam book off the market."
1,There is no 'cure' for addiction,"Addiction is an extremely complex disorder that, probably more than any other, blurs the line between psychology and psychiatry. If there were a 'cure' for it then organizations like AA wouldn't exist, and this book wouldn't have been published solely for the purpose of selling a snake oil treatment philosophy. I was a heroin addict for 3 years, and have been sober now for 6 months, thanks to AA and an innovative treatment center in malibu called Walking Miracles ([...]), that I highly recommend. That being said, no treatment center can 'cure' you if you don't want to be cured. Ultimately it comes down to personal willingness to change and the ability to get some perspective on your situation. To sell any treatment philosophy as a 'cure' for addiction is absurd, and nobody can make that claim."
1,i do not remember getting this book at all,I recommend if you think you mailed this book to me you did not do it. I never got this book so I can not recommend it at all.
2,New saw is a better value,"Reconditioned is supposed to be ""returned to like-new condition"". The saw I received does not look new to me, it looks like a used saw. Deep scratches in the table and some sawdust. For a bit more more, you can get the new version with extensions and stand. The money saved buying a slightly beat-up looking used saw isn't worth it."
4,Nice Worksite Tablesaw,"The Bosch 4000-N-RT is a nice worksite tablesaw. It is lightweight and easy to haul around and set up on site. Cuts well with very little arbor/blade wobble, easily operable fence that stays parallel to the blade. However, the motor is suseptiple to getting dust in the brushes so it needs to be kept clean by blowing the dust out of the motor on a regular basis when doing a lot of ripping. In summary great worksite table saw but not what a serious carpenter would buy for the home shop."
5,Great little wine opener,I agree with the other reviewers. It is so much more hassle-free. It is yet to break a cork. Smooth and easy. Absolutely love it.
4,Corkscrew!,"This is a very innovative product. It is very well designed. It just pops the cork right out of the bottle after a few twists. I thought it was going to be difficult to use, but I was surprised, twist and drink!Pros:-innovative and easy to useCons:-It is a two piece product so you might end up losing either piece in the future.-After opening the corks, it was kind of difficult to remove it from the metal part of the corkscrew (the metal thing that pokes into the cork)."
4,Works Great,Took a second to figure it out but once I did it popped the cork right out with little effort.
5,amazing simplicity,Simply the best corkscrew I've ever owned. Period.Sheeze! Guess I need to write twelve more words. How's this? OK. How 'bout now?
5,The best -- top Scarlatti,"Andjapariadze is ineffable, sensitive to a delicious degree almost beyond compare. Totally gives the lie to the cliche of Scarlatti as master of blitz. In one sonata she slips back into the over-speedy trap which all virtuosos are heir to, but it's to be forgiven. Not to be missed."
1,Worthless Product,"I'm a new contacts user. After 1 1/2 weeks of struggling to get my contacts in & out (and giving up most days after 15 minutes of trying to insert them), I decided to buy this product. It was absolutely no use for soft contacts. After taking the lens out of the solution, the contact lens & inserter has to be completely dried off - if not, it will slide off the inserter. And trying to put the tweezers in my eye for removal - no way! I know it's hard. I'm 41 years old and just starting wearing contacts. It takes time. It has now been 2 months and I am a pro at removing them. Sometimes it takes 2-3 tries to insert them, but it used to take 15 minutes! Trust me - even though it is very frustrating & you think you are the only one in the world that can't get them in & out - it will happen & will get better."
4,Remover tool works great!,"Ordered this to help get contacts OUT of my eyes. I don't have trouble getting them in, so I haven't used the insertion tool. The little ""tweezers"" are great at picking out the contact after I've slid it down to the outside corner of my eye. Little case is very handy to fit in purse, cosmetic bag, etc."
4,Contacts and Long nails here is your answer,i love this kit and it helps me out. I went and had my nails done and then stuggled with my contacts.This kit helps put them in and take them out.
1,Ruined my contact,"The first time I use the tweezers to remove my contact, it didn't help remove them but it created a permanent ripple in my contact so I had to throw them away."
2,not really useful,"Don't know if more practice with this product will make a difference, but I found them hard to use when inserting or removing the lenses to and from the eye. The big problem is that you can't feel if the lense is contacting the surface of the eye with the little tweezers or the tube thing. I ended up using the tweezer to remove the lenses from their containers then put them on my finger tips for insertion. Forget about removing the lenses, I never once successfully remove the lenses using this tool."
1,Not very useful,This product is not very useful. I tried to use it a couple of times to insert and remove soft lenses and it does not do a good job. I also bought the SoftSert inserter and it does a better job. I do not recommend this product - it is a waste of money.
2,lobob soft contact insertion/removal kit,Just use your fingers. I got this because I just started wearing contacts. Thought I needed it. You don't. Stupid
3,Just so so!,".I am one of those people who have a difficult time putting my contacts in. So, when I saw this and read the reviews I thought that this might be the cure. Well, it turns out that the pincher used to remove the contact is really the only thing that worked for me. I hope this will help other's to make a easier decision to purchase this."
1,contact lens remover,The suction cup did not work and it was difficult to use the tweezers. I tried to use it twice and now it just sitting there.
5,Amazing solution for taking your contacts out!,"I ordered three different available contact removal kits as I was desperate about not being able to take my contacts out, I would slide them and try to grab them with my fingers and by the end my eyes would be red. I was about to give up wearing contacts. This product is amazing! Eye doctors should give these out to every contact lens user!I would say it takes 1-3 tries for each eye to get them out, so maybe 10-30 seconds total! I would recomend this product to anyone having trouble getting their contacts out. I can not judge the insertion piece as I never had issues putting them in."
3,works but use fingers.,This product is good for women with long finger nailsif you need help removing the contacts it helpsbut the tool to put contacts in does not work well at all.
2,Tiny tube of frustration!,"I purchased this because my nails are too long to easily remove my contacts. The inserter does not work very well - you have to place the contact, then remove it and dry the inserter so there is no fluid to hold the contact to the inserter, then insert the lens onto the eye. Most of the time the contact just folds in half and pops out. Using my finger is much easier. The real issue I have with this is contact removal. I practice every day, but out of the two months I've had it, I've only been able to remove my contact lens with it twice. Most of the time it just will not grab the lens. Instead it slides over the lens or just moves the lens a little bit around on the eye. I've tried varying degrees of pressure and position, etc. I always end up grabbing the lens with my thumbnail and pulling it out that way which I think is not great, but this remover just does not work for me. I keep trying hoping I will discover some trick to making it work, but so far it's a bust."
4,Lobob Soft Contact applier and remover,"I have been wearing monovision contact lenses for more than 30 years, and have just recently switched eyes. I don't use the Lobob all the time, but every now and then both the applier and the remover have proved very helpful and easy to use. I like the product so much I bought an extra for travel."
2,Not good for me,"I tried to use this product only for the removal aspect. Maybe it is just me, but I was not able to remove the lenses with the tweezers. I gave up and just used my fingers."
2,tweezer do not grip lenses,"I was hopeful this product would help me insert soft contact lenses. The ends are so thin that they spread out when gripping with the tweezers and do not grip the lens. I tried putting my fingers near the tips of this insertion tool and they still did not grip the lens when squeezing. Very disappointing! I do not recommend this product. The case and insertion tools are fine, but I don't need those."
2,Works When Dry,I used the product on a combination soft contact and gas perm hard lense named SynergEyse lenses. The product works when dry. The problem. Once used on one eye... it is not dry. Not recommended. Save your money and learn how to remove with fingers. It is just as effective.
5,Only one that worked,I bought 3 different contact removers and this was the only one that worked. Very easy to get your contact out. Don't bother with the other ones.
2,Not what was expected,"I love the idea & I had VERY high hopes for this item. I have longer nails & it's a HUGE issue getting my contacts out. I needed something that wouldn't have me relying on finding other people not squeemish enough sticking their fingers in other peoples eyes, lol. Anyhow, like I said, this is a great idea, however it didn't help me in any way, shape or form. I'm sorry."
5,BRAVO,This is one of the most enjoyble bios that I have read in years. The author brings a staggering amount of info to the reader in a concise manner. I was waiting a long time for a bio on Gysin and I lucked out here. One I will reread.
4,Port of Entry to Gysin,"After finishing this book I felt sorry for Gysin-- despite his interesting ideas regarding his painting, the cut-up, and general magickal mayhem circa the ""Beat Hotel"" days, he instead chose to be a hanger-on to cosmopolitan royalty and the wealthy. Even his attempt at writing a screenplay for ""Naked Lunch"" was dreadful--strange since he read it pre-publication and spoke to Burroughs for hours regarding the book. I do agree with another reviewer that the biographer doesn't delve into the ideas behind Gysin's visual work very thoroughly...but that may be because Gysin never outlined any (non) direction regarding his work. Nevertheless, for anyone interested in Gysin Idorecommend this book. Thanks to the author for undertaking such a task."
4,Very good book on non-lethal (!) weapons,This book discloses some of the advances of the military on non-lethal weapons and their effects. Very good.
3,print extremely small,"It is an interesting and well thought out book, but the print is very small and if you have trouble with small print, I don't recommend buying it."
3,Angels Don't Play This Haarp: Advances in Tesla Technology,"Book arrived in excellent condition as described. Very interesting reading for anyone with a questionable attitude about what our government is capable of. You may want to go see Michael Moore's latest movie ""Capitalism"". Between the two, you will end up with a lot to think about."
5,Always Tesla,"The printing is terribly small and bad quality. The contents, although repetitive, are of upmost interest and raise a lot of questions specially about the weather changes that we are being confronted with daily. It seems to be an honest description. Of course that when you're dealing with state secrecy - i.e. disinformation, counter information, etc - it is always very difficult to go any further than that."
2,Angels Don't Play This Haarp,"Got me started in the direction of Tesla. Didn't realize that Begich was so much of a Bush hater politically. Once detected political slant, I didn't trust further opinions."
4,Hubris run rampant by the U.S. government.,"The book documents the arrogance, ignorance and hubris of government officials and bureaucrats who may destroy our earth. This story will not be seen in the mainstream media."
3,Kept Me Reading Until Finished,"I mostly agree with the comments in the two previous reviews. It strikes me that the author does sufficiently understand Spanish culture and language. I thought the book was entertaining, but the grammatical and spelling errors were obvious and not infrequent. However, they were not so blatant as to be distracting. I also thought the book tended to bog down in places with the text and dialog choppy at times. I also noticed that the quoted material from the early-day diaries was written in a style and manner that didn't necessarily capture that of the period. I accept the author's style because it makes for an easier read."
2,They are tooo small,"i was so excited when i ordered this item...when they arrived man..i couldnt hardly wait to rip the package open...well when i did..i was very dissapointed...the earrings are sooooooooo small..I was expecting for them to atleast be visible from someone sitting next to me at work..people have to continue to ask me..""what does ur earrings say""....now do not get me wrong, they are cute..but they are sooooooo small...i mean very small.."
4,Exactly what you pay for.,"Hey, it's just under a hundred bucks, not counting shipping. I took into account that it might not work out, seeing as I usually stick with an exercize plan for about half a year and then get bored. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's sturdy, smooth, and noiseless. Like another reviewer said, it makes you do that work: you feel it afterward, and it feels good. If you take a misstep you don't stumble on a motorized belt, and you can change speed immediately. No frills, no bells and whistles. Not like you need them, really.Only complaint: Dealing with the digital interace is a bit annoying. There is one big red button and you push and hold to reset the counts. You pick either miles or km and start walking to set it. Then you click through a calories burned, time passed, or distance walked display and click again to select. Or something like that. It's hard to tell when the display is set to your liking. But if you're going to be watching tv, like I do, it's not a big deal."
1,dangerouse piece of equipment,"Please don't waste your money buying this treadmill. We just put it together only to have to find out it's a piece of junk. The belt doesn't move smoothly, in fact, it jerks and slips. Trying to adjust the belt doesn't solve the problem. We bought it based on the other reviews and after trying this treadmill, I have doubts as to the authenticity of the reviews already listed."
2,it would be fine if it didn't come broken,"One of the pieces was broken, and not a delivery error. It was one of the sockets. I had to return the whole base to the company who then only reimbersed me half of the shipping on a 36 pound package. I still have yet to receive my new part. It has been over 3 weeks since I recieved the original package. I called the company the day after I received it to get the new part. So the product may be fine, just hope you don't have to deal with Phoenix to solve a problem."
1,piece of junk,Easy enough to put together but it doesn't work. The treadbelt will not stay in the center but moves to the right. I have made adjustments as instructed to no avail. I tried calling the phone number on the box the treadmill came in. All I got was an answering machine and no one called me back.
5,A movie that changed my outlook on life,"This film with all its historical inaccuracies and its poor account of St. Clare and Bishop Guido has however the spirit of Franciscanism at its heart and its message is a relevant today as it was in the 13th century. Faulkner is brilliant, he captures the simple, pure humility of St.Francis. What ever happened to him after the movie? Donovan's music is outstanding and fits in perfectly with the simple and humble atmosphere permeating throughout the movie. To learn a more accurate account of the life of St. Francis I must recommend a book called 'St. Francis of Assisi, The Legend and the Life' by Michael Robson OFM Conv.Pax et Bonum, A young Irish Secular Franciscan."
4,I waited too long to see this film,"I recently borrowed the film from my local library. It was purchased in February 2002 & already borrowed 16 times. One of the reasons I viewed it is because it's the work of Franco Zeffirelli.Not having seen it, I dismissed it as a ""hippie"" version. But Francis' simplicity, innocence, humility & love for God's creatures came through beautifully. Plus, the cinematography is stunning, & made me homesick for Tuscany & Umbria.I've always loved St. Francis since my mom took me to the church named after him on 31st ST in New York City.It wouldn't hurt any of us to be more like the poor man of Assisi."
5,"Francis and Clare, the early years.","I watch this video at least twice a year. Once in October near the feast of St. Francis. The film does a very good job of presenting the early years of the Fraciscan orders. It even makes reference to the begining of the Third Order (Secular Franciscans). The scenery and the gentle love between Francis and Clare in the film are attempts at showing Francis's passion for creation. The hard realities are also presented, that is the institutional church finding visionaries such as Francis a challenge. The presentation of Francis in his father's factory puts the focus on the social justice Francis stood for (Francis beyond the bird bath).There are many good biographies on Francis. This film is great for introducing those who do not know of Francis (and Clare) some of what he stood for and the gifts he left us with.Peace and all goodDianne, TSSF(Third Order Society of St. Francis)"
4,A film worth watching only for the message,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon after my friends told me it was a great film. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli I expected it to be as good as 'Jesus of Nazareth' (1977). Unfortunately I didn't find it as good as that.The movie touches only very few aspects of the life of St Francis. (St Clare is only a passing mention). There are a few good songs, including the title song, it would be a good musical but not a biography of a great saint.The Catholic Church hierarchry is shown in the negative light. Pretty sad for a movie about one of the greatest saints of the Catholic Church.The movie is worth watching, (especialy since there is no other Hollywood movie on this great Saint). It has touched many people, and inspired vocations to the Franciscan order.If you really want to know the spirituality of this great saint then read the book."
5,This is truly one of the Best films ever!,"In a world in which our kids can not see television without seen any violence. It is truly wonderful to say, that this film is one of morals and humility. Living in such a materilistic world, we see the works and experience some of fealings of this truly great Saint(ST. Francis of Assisi). This film is a family film which potrays the mission we all have as christians in this world. I encourage all to gather their families and let them be inspired by the works of this Saint."
4,Awesome and enjoyable,"This film midst its early 70's influence remains timeless as the other Zefferelli history films-Jesus of Nazereth, Romeo andJuliet. This film being very correct in the history of the earlyCatholic Church does reach out to other faiths. The music beingvery much of the late 60's style does fit in the scenes. True that today we would use some of todays music if filmed today but would it fit as well. Watch the Dedication of the Chapel and tell me that with the music it doesn.t get you. Or earlier the building of the Chapel. This is a Classic and worth it.In this age of getting rid of the old we should remember thatnot all of our modern and recent remakes are as good as theOriginal. Even Modern Artists have yet to master or even createoriginal masterpieces of old Masterpieces.All I am saying is give this film a new look and believe me you will enjoy it as much as I have. Go in Peace and use words"
4,Just as good the second time around,"I had seen this movie as a teenager when it was first released. It had a profound impact on me at the time. I purchased it to see if I could recapture that feeling. It did not disappoint. The cinematography is beautiful. Through the lens of time, it was a bit more simplistic than I remembered, but I would recommend it for anyone."
5,"Brother Sun, Sister Moon","Brother Sun, Sister Moon main objective is to show viewers how human beings have the capacity to give up everything for their purpose in life. This production represents beauty and the bases for meaning. Franco Zeffirelli is equivalent to Michael Angelo when it comes to producing movies; movies that leave you with the desire for beauty."
5,Inspiring,"A beautifully shot film by Zeffirelli about the life of Saint Francis and Sister Claire. I highly recommend this film to anyone that loves Zeffirelli's work and that enjoys historical and spiritual works. An inspiring, lovely, little gem of a film."
5,franciscan joy,This is a portrayal of the early years of Francis of Assisi told with the pageantry that bears the Zeffirelli mark.The story is simply made basically to attract the 60's movement.For people of faith it is a sensitive retelling of the Franciscan story.The music of Donovan adds to the spiritual atmosphere by capturing musically the Franciscan spirit of simple faith and joy in God's creation.Curiously the haunting musical score was never released in English on LP or CD. Too many critics have failed to realize the inner beauty of the film.
1,tom keogh is damn right: it's a bore...!,"zeffirelli is a technically talented but very pretentious italian filmaker with a good lack of ideas. i do agree with tom keogh about anything he says about this film, including the attemp of turning Saint Francis into some flower power leader. this film is honey-dropping, with a unprecise historical view on the life of the saint, above all as regards his attitudes before his enlightment. some scenes with that flute sweeeet soundtrack look really oily...."
5,Zeffirelli,"This film is worth watching,worth reveling in, if only to experience the soothing benefits of a supreme eye candy experience. In perfect harmony with its subject it achieves a real mystical fervor and communicates a loving spirit."
4,"Excellent message, moving drama, acting less than stellar","Brother Sun, Sister Moon portrays the life of Francis of Assisi as a young man responding to his call to ministry. The acting is reasonably well done but certainly not worthy of an Academy nomination. However, if that is of concern, the viewer is missing the point of the movie. The film moves one into the consciousness of Francis as he struggles with what he sees as an unfulfilled career as a merchant. Searching for a more fulfilling purpose, he offers himself to the guidance of Spirit and sets out upon a path that most in his community consider to be foolhardy. This can be a marvelous movie for someone going through a transition in life. Lovely photography, wonderful soundtrack."
2,Un historical,"Filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli (Endless Love) adds his own 'Flower Power' 60s style philosophy to the conversion story of St. Francis of Assisi. It's a shame that the film director didn't think the real story of this great saint's life was interesting enough to be told truthfully. (So it goes with Hollywood). If you do decide to see this film, we strongly recommend reading St. Francis' real-life biography so as not to be mislead! Caution: there are a couple of nudity scenes.St. Francis of Assisi is a true Prince and pillar of the Catholic Church. He was given the gift of the Stigmata and suffered Christ's wounds in his body for many years. (Not revealed in this movie). St. Francis had a very true and deep devotion to Our Lord present in the Blessed Sacrament. (Also not revealed). The truth is, his real-life story is beyond anything Hollywood would ever dare produce today!"
2,Not so great the 2nd time around,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the early 70's. I was a senior in HS and went w/a girlfriend and thought that it was great. Fast forward 40 years: I came across this selection while browsing the list of free videos offered by AmazonPrime and was excited by the prospect of watching it again. Unfortunately, some things are best left as memories. On second viewing--with a pair of much older (and sober) eyes--the movie was a crushing disappointment. The acting was sappy, the script made me cringe, and even the music by Donovan was hard to stomach. While the actual story of St. Francis of Assisi is very engaging and inspirational, this movie did not begin to do it justice. Sad."
5,Saint Francis of Assisi,"If you do not know the story you will after this superior production. If you do know St. Francis then you will be delighted to have your memory refreshed. A great job, fantastic acting and such a beautiful story. Must see for anyone who can relate to goodness."
5,Jim Ryan Review,"This is an extraordinary movie about extraordinary people: Saint Francis of Assissi and Saint Clare. It is valuable as a teaching tool for Caholic Catechists. Thr Catholic hierarchy was at and all time low in corruption in St. Francis' day. This film demonstrates with superb artisitic merit how Francis and Clare changed the world for the better. The acting, cinematography, and screenplay are esemplary."
5,"Brother Sun, Sister Moon (a movie about Francis of Assisi)","When I first saw this movie at a theater in 1975 I was completely overwhelmed and moved in a very positive way by it's compassion and beauty. The acting by all the actors is excellent, Zeffirelli's direction and the photography is wonderful, and because this movie led me to years of study of and reverence for Francis of Assisi, I can say that the the movie is mostly historically accurate.For those of you who consciously or unconsciously yearn for a compassionate lovingness in todays hard world, this movie will deeply move you, inspire you positively, and uplift you."
1,"Bother sun, Sister Moon DVD","This DVD did not play. A message cam up when you try to play it saying ""check regional code"". I had never seen that before. I contacted them about it and they were very nice about explaining the return policy."
3,Query,"This film was unique, yet gave a pretty accurate portrayal of St. Francis of Assisi.But ... the scene where the Franciscans are building that chapel during winter, and there's a closeup of this kid sitting under some ruins and smiling at the camera ... was that Sarah Jessica Parker? I thought maybe that was her first television appearance."
2,Horrible leftist simplification,"I know this movie was made in the 70s, right after the age of Aquarius presumably faded, but is that really an excuse to see everything through pink hippie glasses? St Francis was not a hippie, he was not a marxist ideologue, and he did not treat the leaders of his age with arrogant disdain. This is clearly the way that Zefirelli likes and approves, and wants others to emulate, even those dead a few hundred years. And it's easy if one can reinvent reality to suit one's desires. I wonder what it feels like to be rich, an opinion leader and jetset member, while heaping scorn and ridicule on the establishment of another era. But the danger of hypocrisy has never stopped those of his ilk, witness today's entertainment-media complex. I think the music is as insipid as the social criticism, but the cinematography is okay.I have been to Assisi, I have read about St. Francis, including his biography by Bonaventura. This movie is like a cheap imitation of the real thing."
2,Where did the beauty go?,"I remember this as a wonderful beautiful and loving movie from the first time I saw it in 1973. ...The movie is slow, the acting is poor, the scenery is wonderful but the story was so poorly presented that it hurt. This movie is a real candidate for a remake. A wonderful story that could be presented so much more wonderfully than it was, even though in 1973 it seemed so good."
5,"Spirit soothing , beautiful movie","Whether or not the history portrayed in this film is accurate, I could not say. I am not even Catholic, but have always been drawn to St Francis. The music and visuals alone are worth the watch and the (perhaps romanticised) protrayal of St Francis is in keeping with the quiet beautiful spirit he is known for. I have watched and loved this video for over 15 years and recently shared it with my 12 year old grandaughter, who loved it as well."
1,Wrong Product/doesn't work for me.,"I thought dvd's were ""dvd's"". NOT. I bought this dvd and when I tried to play it, it didn't work. I got a weird message on the dvd. What happened is simple, once I know what is going on. I purchased an European dvd version that doesn't work on US machines. duh!?! But, I just didn't know about that little difference...that in fact, makes all the difference in the world.I'm posting this only as a means of helping others NOT make the same mistake as I did.The seller offered to take the dvd back, which was really nice. By the time I pay the shipping back, though, I won't gain much headway.I guess I'll just put the dvd up for sale.Anyone need a new, unused copy of Brother Sun Sister Moon....European Version?LOL."
3,Pure 1972,"This is a beautifully filmed and well-acted film about the life of St. Francis, making him to appear to have been an early 1970s hippy. The contrasts between rich and poor, the Establishment and the innocents, the cruel and the good, are about as subtle as a punch in the nose, and the air-head, gooey love message is accompanied by 1960s folk songs. Zeffirelli deserves applause for his usual high standards; many shots are as paintings. The costumes and sets are rich. But as for the story, well, it's easier to appreciate this film if you know little or no European history and are smoking funny cigarettes."
3,"Assisi, Italy was very Beautiful","The only reason I watched Brother Sun, Sister Moon was because I was in Assisi, Italy and learned about St. Clare. I read everything I could on her life. I already knew about St. Francis, and St. Clare was one of his devoted followers. Someone told me that this movie was all about their lives. I watched the movie and it did follow their lives to the ""T"". I felt that the actors weren't that good, but just knowing the story made it worth watching. I have given the DVD to friends that went with us to Assisi, Italy."
5,Amazon reviewer has it all wrong.,Zeffirelli's telling of the story St. Francis passionate and moving. There is an interesting parallel between St. Francis and the youth movements of the late 1960's and early 1970's: hope and belief. Graham Faulkner as Francis is convincing and his performance enduring.
5,Inspirational!,"Sanford gives the truth that the Lord is not only here to heal us physically, but he can heal our emotional and psychological difficulties as well. Jesus is able to meet us in the midst of our pain and offer complete healing. You need to read this book!"
3,"Hope to see it soon, read this anyway","The reason I only gave it three stars is because I have never seen the videos. I have, although, read the manga (graphic novels) to this serise.I give the manga 5 stars. It is a tale of the Dark stalkers, some and most demons, vampires and succubus's, some try to blend in with the world, some hunt one another and some just go by with life. I highly recomend this serise!"
1,Not for TLs,"Receiver did not fit a 2006 TL as stated. When attached to tow hook, drill points would have been in angled area of trunk floor. I did not see any way to shim or pull the four drilled holes [2"" off]. Receiver is also suppose to fit a Honda Accord. If it does, this is a nice receiver."
4,"Well built, but.......",The hardware appears to be very well built. My laptop does not have a high speed USB so downloading is very slow. The main criticism I have is that the documentation is very skimpy. It would be helpful if there was a good set of instructions on how to go about selecting files & folders to be backed up.
4,An album for humid summer nights and silent films...,"Sure, you'll want to play ""Did You Get What You Came For?"" in the late orange afternoon, but the rest of the album is a perfect backdrop for those long, cricket-chirping, summer nights. Lazy, psychedelic, and infused with sticky-warm melodies, (In)organics is one of the best albums from a great Michigan band. I saw them in Lansing a few years back and I'll always associate these songs, particularly the fuzzy clockwork guitar lines of ""Star,"" with the silent film they projected on the back wall. The clicking of the old projector only added to the nostalgic electric warmth of the music.A great recording."
5,stella,"the sound of a summer night conveyed on one cd. after the opening jaunt of 'did you get what you came for' the darkness descends and the stars come out. the chill of the early hours, the sinister shadows and finally the dawn and the heat of the sun... it's all here. beautiful and moving, intriguing, mesmerizing and enthralling. this album started my love affair with this Michigan band, it was my favourite release of 2000 (it came out later in the UK) and i still play it loads.Love it, love it, love it."
4,Tenacious CD,"Bought this back when my girlfriend and I were living in a tiny room with friends, and the sounds of this CD brought us through. Smooth brasses complementing richly produced delicate guitars with lyrics both melancholy and meaningful, (In)Organics continues, now two years later, to be a favorite."
2,Bad Prescription,"The Doc is known for wacky collaborations, from singing with out of style boys band to rapping with corrupt political figures, well I guess he's been everywhere but in the right place, which would be, at the studio, working on his next solo project.Liaisons Dangereuses is another half-hearted effort, with a couple of good notes ( ""Viens faire un tour dans les cites"", ""L'Homme qui ne valait pas dix centimes"", ""Hexagonal"" ) drawn into a noize of lazy rhymes and poor productions.To be fair, this is not a Doc Gyneco's album, this is a compilation from various emcees, without a real cohesiveness to it, too bad, cuz it could have been so much more.If you're just getting into french hip hop, don't bother, but if you enjoy Doc Gyneco's experimentations, then you just might like it."
5,Great Rythm!!!,"French rap music is considered as exotic hip-hop by Americans. However, this cd rocks. It involves unknown and known French artists. And in my opinion, the key song is L'homme Qui ne Valait Pas Dix Centimes. No need to understand French in order to appreciate the content. And that is great!!!"
4,"Some see as ""fun"", others see as ""essentail""","Okay, it's not classic literature, but it fills a void which, for some, could be just as important.This group of ""must know topics, skills and abilities"" for Dads, could certainly be valuable knowledge for any parent, regardless of gender. As for the value of contents, here's the proof of this kind of book: As mundane as they might appear to adults, the items included in this book are the very things many children will take with them into adulthood as ""best memories"". What could be better?"
3,I think the color is fading...,"I'm rating this product with three stars because the color is beginning to fade, and I've had these flowers for two months at the most. These are kind of expensive to have them fade so quickly. I'm not sure that I would order this product again, although I have no problems with the seller."
4,I've been waiting for this book-,"I have been looking for a support group in my area for years and cannot find one. This book has taken the place of a group. Very informative about Bipolar and the mental and physical issues surrounding it. My husband has had Bipolar/Resistant Depression for 20+ years and this book taught me more than any counselor ever has. The book concentrates on the spouse who needs support but encourages the spouses to try to change/help the ill partner. I found that frustrating, as I know the healthy person cannot really change the ill person. We can only stand by, love, and keep the family functioning. Overall, this book has been a gift to me and I recomend it to any family member suffering with a very depressed/Bipolar individual."
2,Loving Someone,"I was hoping for something different, I suppose. Magical thinking on my part. It seems like my husband's bipolar disorder holds me hostage with the mood swings and verbal abuse and now I am supposed to keep charts and diaries and ask him questions. Our lives revolve around what kind of mood he is in and after 14 years of it I feel ready to bail out. It just seems like the author expects the partner to be saint-like and totally wrapped up in their spouse's disorder. This might help a couple that is just at the beginning and if the person with the Bipolar disorder is willing to take meds and be involved with their treatment. Good luck."
4,Holding the bipolar spouse & partner responsible !!,"I have been married to a BP for almost 12 years and this book put many of my feelings into writing. I had a problem with the chapter on finances as I think it should have been made more clear that Bipolar II people generally do not have A problem with spending sprees and mania. Also, I think the book presented a lot of extreme cases, i.e. multiple hospitalizations and being unable to work and have sex. BUT I think with that aside, the book has some great practical ideas for management."
2,Not for parents,From title I thought it would cover parent / adult child relationship. There are only a few pages on this topic.
3,One Clinician's Perspective,"""Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder"" is a great book from the perspective of both knowing more about this particular disorder as a clinician and seeing it from the perspective of a family member who lives with a loved one that has the disorder. The work uses clear language, easily understandable and it resonates with people that want to genuinely understand more about the disorder without getting overly clinical as in the DSM-4 TR2000 (the bible for mental health practitioners on disorders). I believe it is a great buy as a supplemental piece clinically, not the single source on the disorder and is quite informative."
2,Patience is required to love someone with bp,"I read this book while dating a bipolar man. Like many others, I became frustrated with the suggestions being made to the non-bb partner. Basically, the suggestions were the non-bb partner should take on all the responsibilities in the relationship. In addition we are asked to stuff our frustrations and ""never argue"" with our bipolar spouse. We also ""trigger"" our bp spouses. After reading this book and dating a bp man for two years, I felt depressed. Prior to reading this book I was already his caretaker. After tolerating multiple issues/symptoms he attributed to being bp i later found out he was cheating(very common with bp). It was way too much for me to bear. In the end I decided I don't have the patience/understanding to be in a relationship with someone who is bipolar. I need a more balanced relationship/partnership.I do think this book will help non-bb spouses who are EXTREMELY patient, in love, and understanding."
3,Not very compassionate,"This is my first review on Amazon... ever. But I had to write, when I saw the phrase meant for the partners, ""Help more around the house."" That made me livid! I do everything around the house already in my relationship with my BP husband.This book is straight-forward with lots of good suggestions. But it certainly did not feel very compassionate towards the person who is already bearing the brunt of the family responsibilities. It mostly said to the partner - ""just be even more compassionate and don't provoke them."" For me who has a husband who after several years is in the barely accepting it stage, this felt so discouraging. Maybe this is more for family members, and not for a spouse. I feel like I need to find something supportive, to keep me going, somewhere else."
2,Something lacking,"I was very excited for this book, I was really seeking out an all-encompasing book on the topic for my loved ones. After reading this book, not one of my loved ones will ever see this book, unless of course they seek it out and purchase it themselves. I think this book casts people with Bipolar in a very negative light. Instead of being useful and instilling hope, I found it to be depressing and very limiting. I feel you should give your loved ones a really good idea of what it means to be bipolar, but it should be cast in a positive light, not a negative one."
5,Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder,If you or your love one has Bipolar Disorder this book is great for the whole family. I have been married sixteen years and when my husband read the book he finally understood the illness. Thank God for the author.
4,More help than any therapist!,"I am so grateful to find specific suggestions to help me deal with my partner's behavior and emotions.As a Buddhist, I know that ""not arguing"" is not co-dependence, and prevents unnecessary stress and hurt feelings for us both. It is a conscious, compassionate decision that sustains my own positive behavior & emotions, despite the stresses of his illness or any other negativity around me. I understand that some folks might feel this non-reaction is patronizing - but folks with BPD can be so self-centered! Partners have to refuse to be drawn into unnecessary drama.The ""bi-polar free zone"" suggestion really works at our house, particularly in the evening when everybody's tired. Creating the health cards is helping our 13-year-old daughter understand and deal with her father's behavior.The one thing I regret the book doesn't discuss is the positive effect of good nutrition, not just avoiding junk food and caffeine.May all our sufferings be eased."
4,Costume was fun,Purchased for my 3 year old grandson. Halloween was a week ago and he's still playing pirate! Loves it. Good buy.
4,Adorable,"This is an adorable costume and my little boy loves it. The hat was too large, but it was easy to find a replacement. We also have to wear a shirt under it for more coverage, but I would recommend this costume for any pirate."
5,William Holden as his most gorgeous self....,"I couldn't believe that no ""customer"" had reviewed this film...the biggest shocker of 1953 and condemned by the Catholic Church! I was just out of high school and couldn't WAIT to see this movie. I went alone as none of my friends took movies as seriously as I did in those years. No one could say, ""You could've knocked me over with a feather,"" as well as David Niven. More shocking than the utterance of ""virgin,"" was Dawn Adams running around nude under her mink coat. The New York setting added to this wonderful story....a true antidote to teenagers' lives in hick towns waiting to leave home to meet a William Holden to jazz up their existence....nearly a half century ago!!! Think of it...not ONE sex scene, yet it got the hormones churning from the opening atop the Empire State Building to the closing when ""boy gets girl."""
3,A CLASSIC LOVE STORY!!,"This is a good romantic comedy which features on two characters who meet on top of the empire state building and end up falling in love during the coarse of the night. This film is a bit talkative because it was adapted from the stage play, but it's funny, warm, and romantic because of William Holden, David Niven, and Maggie McNamara.3 ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS-[1953]BEST ACTRESS-MAGGIE McNAMARABest Film EditingBest Song-""The moon is blue"""
2,too pale of blue to sit through,"i remember when this film first came out..AND I WAS TOO YOUNG to be allowed to see it because words like VIRGIN were used!what?the first 45 minutes of this mess is a groner.and it is easily seen that this must have been ment for hepburn,not kathrine,as this actress is a terrible replica of either.eventualy the film improves as niven is introduced into this mess and becomes almost a likeable film.but alas,this film is far too pale of a blue to barely sit through.niven and holden are good and are way above the plot.unless you like these two actors this is perhaps only a collector's ""play-toy"" to add to one's shelf of seen only once films."
3,"Good, but could be better","Charles Ives' Symphony No. 2 is my favorite symphony, period. I have every recording of it that I am aware of and I even have the sheet music for study (although not the new critical edition of the score). Schermerhorn's new performance is certainly well done, in an understated manner, but lacks a bit in power and bite. At times I sence the Nashville Symphony Orchestra is not really ""in"" to Ives and this band sounds small, like a chamber group. The only time the music-making lifted me out of my chair was during the finale - a fine account. The best of the digital recordings of this work is still Bernstein's DG performance, though my preference is Bernstein's analog recording from 1959, loaded with the excitment I wish this new Naxos disc had."
1,Uncommonly Bland Performance of an Exciting Work,"I grew up in the 1960's with the Bernstein recording of the Ives Second. Although this recording with the Nashville Symphony claims to use a more authentic edition of the score, I was sorely dissapointed by the lackluster performance. Lowfat cottage cheese has more zest than this reading. Although the orchestra plays in tune and together (the best I can say for them), the conducter fails to communicate the quirky, irreverent fun of this delightful work. Flat!, very flat!! Superior even to the classic Bernstein recording is Michael Tilson-Thomas's wonderfully crisp and exciting reading. The Nashville Symphony recording may be scholarly, but that is exactly how it sounds--boringly academic!"
4,Fun to Wallow In,"Most of Ives's orchestral music sounds like a great big sloppy mess, but it can be fun to wallow in from time to time. It is nice to have this music available at a budget price, and both performance and recording quality are truly excellent. Whether you are a long-time Ives fan or rather a music fan curious about this iconoclastic composer, this CD represents an excellent bargain."
