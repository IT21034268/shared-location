1,Not worthy of Wilton's name,This device is terrible! The teeth don't stay in the holder and keep falling out before you can even try it out on the cake! Don't waste your money!
2,VERY TRICKY!,"The Wilton Ice Sculptor is a very Tricky Item to work with because of the Blades Not Staying Put!...there's really nothing to hold them once they are Slide into the Holder, they are too Loose and they Slide right Out if you don't keep the Holder Straight Up, if you Tilt just a little, all the Blades...out they Go! The Blades need to be Held Tight in order to Scrape the Icing all around the Cake to make the Imprint, Thus the Design. Everytime I bake a Cake I pull it out wanting to give the Ice Sculptor another try, with the same results64 Blades, so many of them, Different Colors all attached very loosely to some strips of very Thin Cardboard like Paper and they don't want to stay there either. They are running Free inside the Flimsy Box and sometimes they Fall Out of the Box so you keep loosing them...very Frustrating. It needs Better Packaging as well . The Ice Sculptor was giving to me as a Gift, It is a Good Idea of a Product, however, it needs to Go Back to the Designing Room Table!"
2,Can't get it to work right,"The pieces do fall out, and you have to use a LOT of icing. I still haven't been able to get it to work right... I don't know what the trick is, but this is not as easy as it looks. If anyone has any tips, I'd appreciate it!"
1,Doesn't work for me,"I thought this item would be idiot proof but I was way wrong. Have tried several times, unless you are a professional I don't think you should waste your money on this product."
1,not a good fit,i was excited when i bought this product. had the opportunity to use it for the first time and i was disappointed. the pieces didnt fit tight into the holder and moved around when i tried it on the cake. i will stick with the VIVA papertowel method..
1,Horrible Tool,I am a professional cake artist and I have to say that this thing is horrible. The markers slide if the icing is a little stiff. We do not use shortening in our buttercream so it is a little stiffer. I have one for sale if anyone wants it for a deal!
1,"Very inconsist, doesnt work well",the little white thingy that holds the different designs doesnt hold them tight at all. They alwasy fall out. Doesntwork.
3,Ok,"This is ok, bought it for my dad who decorated cakes and it broke easily. He used it sa couple of times. It's ok."
4,Excellent Pre-schooler selection!!,My daughter loves ALL Mercer Mayer's books. She's two and makes Dad read at least three or four per day. They're well written and beautifully illustrated. She spots something new every time we read one.
1,Depressing,"Just a Rainy Day captures the essence of Mercer Mayers Little Critters - and that's what they are - Little Critters. They look messy, their house looks messy, their parents always look worn and haggard, the events of the book are not sweet or endearing - when my child gets one of these books at school or as a gift I know I'm in for 10-15 minutes of lower-middle class critter malaise as we read the new acquisition.My wife just threw our copy of Just A Rainy Day. I noticed that this book is available in ""Used"" condition through Amazon for 1 cent - rather than make a penny from the sale of this book, I would suggest they seize the intangible benefits of catharsis that comes from chunking this lame book in the trash."
4,I like it !,The quality is good as the brand it self stand for. The color and the texture of the material is good !
4,Lots of rules but definitely gets you regular!,"I've been a vegetarian for the last 3.5 years so started at Level 3 of the detox diet. There are a lot of rules and it's really hard to remember all of them all of the time so I've been picking and choosing what I feel like doing. I'm not following the diet to lose any weight but, in following the basic tenement of not mixing certain food groups together, my digestive system has become slicker than ever. Before starting the regimen, I would go 1-2 times every day. Now I go 3-4 and there's never any straining. A friend of mine who has battled with constipation for a long time also started this diet and is now regular w/ 1 movement every day."
5,Awesome Book,"I was so impressed with this book and the gradual and ""finding your own"" into raw foods. It makes so much sense, the lists are so helpful and I love the different options that didn't scrub my colon basically raw! I am brand new to this and am able to follow it without any harmful side effects, just the side effects of feeling so much better and losing weight. I checked this book out from the library, read the 1st (and maybe 2nd) chapter and ordered! I love it, Thank you Ms. Rose!!!"
3,"Some contradictions, but overall informative","I liked the information in this book but still have some questions. The food group combinations she makes very clear in the beginning of the book are contradicted with the recipes she provides. I think the quick exit program is severely important for a raw foodist but, where is the backing or ""proof"" to what happens in the stomach when you mix fruit with other food items. I'd like more detailed information on why foods should be eaten in solidarity."
3,Confused,"The book sample is missleading. You are left thinking the author will give you the details and tools you need, but she won't. She gives you rules to follow that are not well explained and then gives you recipes that contradict the rules. I was left confused and disappointed. Not enough time was spent on any one topic to digest the information and apply it to your everyday life."
5,The Raw Food Detox Diet,I love this book. It's written very well and is easy to understand. Anyone can follow this diet in some form or another!
3,Raw,"This is a hard concept for most of us to grasp in today's hectic world. In order to do it right, what we eat should be raw and it should be organic. Sounds easy, but hard to pull off.I got more out of Brenda Watson's book Fiber 35."
1,Not what it seems,This book starts off making lots of sense & gets you all hyped up....but when you start to read what it's really all about...the actual diet...you're very discouraged. It's not a practical diet for the everyday life of a working mom. I'll stick to Weight Watchers. I returned the book for a refund.
3,Good service,"I bought this book to use for a research/presentation I'm working on. It got ""delivered"" couple of days before the last estimated date I was supposed to receive it; however, I did not get it. According to the third party seller, it got lost in delivery and it was not their fault. It wasn't. It took me a while to get in touch with them but after I emailed them expressing my frustrations, they replied quickly and sent me another book without charge. The buying processes wasn't that bad since their service ended up being good but I'm still hesitant to purchase from a 3rd party seller."
1,The fastest way to an eating disorder I know of,I bought this book several years ago and followed the diet exactly. Three years later my digestion is terrible. My diet now consists of vegetables and a small amount of grains. I cannot eat fruit or nuts. Do not buy this book if you are an emotional eater. By this book for the recipes. Do not follow her eating advice.
1,Misleading Title,"How can a ""raw food"" detox diet include recipes for meat and cooked foods?! This book needs a new title. It is a waste of money for anyone looking to truly detox their body."
1,"Colassol waste of money, deceptive title","This is not a raw food book, let alone a detox book. There are probably more cooked recipes in here than raw. I hate this book and the fact that I bought it. This woman is using a title that has nothing to do with the content of her book to make money. Further, the book is useless unhealthy garbage. Even the raw recipes are awful- 5 teaspoons of honey with almond butter on one romaine leaf? I can't wait to get rid of it, as everytime I look at it I am reminded of being ripped off by a product that is stupid. Don't buy it!"
1,Absurd ideas not founded on science,"I was really looking forward to some substantial scientifically based information on ""raw foodism"", like why raw food is better for us than cooked, but alas no such information. Lots of ridiculous statement about ""cell debris"" and enzymes in juices that help human digestion. Plant enzymes help plants, not humans. We eat fruits and vegetables for minerals, vitamins, and fiber, the human body makes its own enzymes. Also, Rose advocates the outdated food-combining theories that have been debunked over and over. She also warns of the mythical ""auto-intoxication"" that can result from having too much raw food too soon that unclogs waste matter from the body. This is a ridiculous idea, but I did begin to think people who believe this nonsense must be the same ones who thought WMD's were in Iraq when every credible source said they were not."
2,A Book,"This book's writing is a bit confusing. It talks about many things, but not very much about weight loss."
5,The Big Change,"I have had my animals on a raw food diet for almost 3 years and have seen the remarkable changes in them. I thought, ""Why not me?"" Although I am not on an all raw food diet, this book is a great resource for incorporating more raw foods into my life!"
3,Not a vegetarian yet......,"I bought this book because it seemed to me that the Hallelujah Diet was just a little too cold turkey (no pun intended)into the raw food vegetarian lifestyle. This book rightly explains that to not make this a somewhat gradual change could have some really uncomfortable effects as our bodies need time to transition from our old ways of eating. I like that the book gives tips and recipes for whatever level you're at. The author has some really strange theories on how to maintain proper bodily functions which I mostly disagree with but aside from that, it is a helpful book."
1,The Raw Food Detox Diet by Natalia Rose,"I was very disappointed in this book. The title is deceiving. I am a vegan and thought this book was for health. Meat, eggs, cheese and lots of oil are not healthy for you. These products are full of cholesterol and artery clogging fats. She discourages the eating of legumes and soy products. May I suggest that this author and others that are interested in health read the China Study by T. Colin Campbell,PhD and Diet for a New America by John Robbins"
4,Love it but no so sure how well it's working...,"I love Natalia's advice and recipes, but I'm really not so sure how well it is working for me. I'm eating around level 3, except I'm not having the green lemonade first thing in the morning as I need a new juicer. My digestive system is working the best it ever has, which is amazing, but I've been having stomach pains every day and have been very bloated the whole time. I was really hoping to lose weight on this plan but I am so bloated constantly that I am unsure what is going on. Did this happen to anyone else and did it go away? I love eating raw until dinner and I love how my digestive system is working, but I hate the bloating and the pains."
1,Author doesn't follow own advice in recipes.,"This book centers around one big idea, that certain food groups should not be mixed within a meal in order to achieve the best digestive flow. I thought this seemed reasonable and was very interested in following. The author indicates that fruit should never be mixed with any other food group and should be eaten approximately one half hour before other food or hours after. When looking through her recipes to try to follow her plan, most of the dressing recipes and a few other mixed fruit in with them. Either she does not follow her own advice or did not do a good job of explaining the specific requirements in detail. I do not recommend this book."
3,The Raw Food Detox Diet,"It is a good transitional book for going raw or partially raw. It has a few good recipes in it. It is probably a book that you could borrow from the library, read and copy some of the recipes because although it was a good read, I doubt I would re-read it."
4,Raw Food Lifestyle,"This is quite a comprehensive explanation of ""what"" and ""why"" eating a raw food lifestyle is best for the human body. I believe calling it a ""Detox Diet"" may put people off. I recommend Ms Rose's book ""Raw Food Life Force Energy"" as well. Raw food eating is not a new fad but the originally intended way for food preparation. Dr. N. W. Walker wrote many outstanding books published by Norwalk Press; hopefully, they are not out of print. Ms Rose continues in this tradition"
4,diet books,The book is easy to read and understand . It makes really good sense . A lot of the info you have heard of in different books but this one brings it together. I would of liked a little more info on the different foods listed in the different catigories. A more complete lists of quick exit foods and the right combinations .
1,Not good,"Some of her recipes are good but raw foodism is based on bad science and the plan she suggests is even worser due to the complicated food combinations she uses, which are based on even worse science, do you know that one of the international speakpersons of them Harvey Diamond has abandoned them completely?"
2,Waste of Time,"This book is much too complicated for what it needs to be. The one point she makes in this book that I agree with is ""you need to bring in less garbage into your body today that you did yesterday"".This book is close to 300 pages but it needn't be. Raw foodism is a lifestyle choice, it's supposed to be simple. As a vegan I looked into this book for recipes but what I found was a lot of convoluted nonsense this author touts. If you want to eat raw, then do it. You don't need a rule book to tell you how to do it. As for the ""maximum weight loss"" claim, well, if you're filling your face with garbage right now, you will lose weight but only because you're eating healthy food. It's not rocket science."
1,DONT BUY,No body really eats like this. To much preperation and planning and you just cant enjoy eating if you follow the guidlines. Of course you will loose weight your eating like a bunny rabbit.
4,Going Raw,"From cover to cover this book speaks the truth about our terrible eating habits in America. This is both a very simple and very difficult diet to put into action because it runs counter to what we find readily available in supermarkets and restaurants. Vegans will find it particularly easy to adjust to. It would be helpful to get the whole family on board because you have to ""cook"" at home to realize the full benefit of the program. It isn't cheap either, but then what is your health worth? If you can follow this plan, you will feel incredibly good, lose weight (if you want to) and probably stave off a multitude of diseases. The author promotes several levels of dietary changes, so it isn't an all or nothing type of program. Even implementing the first level will have long-term health benefits. This is a quick read, so you can start right away."
5,Kindle Edition is Flawed,"I just downloaded this book, and it looks like a fine, well-organized and helpful book. The problem? When you get to the section with the recipes, you find a list with page numbers. (No page numbers on the Kindle.) The recipe list is not electronically interactive, so finding a recipe becomes a protracted scroll-a-thon. With a book such as this, you want to do a lot of flipping back and forth, and it ain't easy with this electronic edition. If I had it to do over, I'd get the paper-and-ink version."
5,Awesome!,"I found this book really helpful as a person who has transitioned from a Vegetarian to a Vegan to now a Raw Vegan over the past few months (you do not have to be a Vegetarian to follow this book). The details on food combining are great for weight loss and the green drinks are amazing, they will give you more energy than a double shot at Starbucks! Even if you are not interested in weightloss; the principles this book is founded upon will provide you with optimal health..If you are still eating processed, packaged, chemical laden, carcinogenic food, grab this book ASAP it will save your life. I am disgusted by the way I used to eat (and was thinking it was healthy..frozen meals, dead food..gross!)."
1,Literally a pig in a poke.,"The title suggests that this is a raw foods book. Not only are many of the recipes not raw, some contain meat and dairy products. If you are looking for a book on changing to a healthy plant based diet, try The Great American Detox Diet by Jamieson or anything by Jennifer Raymond, especially the Peaceful Palate."
2,Not really my raw style,Spends a significant amount of time on colonics--yeah not really my thing. I wouldn't suggest this for anyone starting raw.
4,"If I can, anyone can","The book was well-organized and easy to follow. It's not really a diet-diet, but a better way of eating. For those people--like me--who know they have to change their eating habits without feeling judged for the way they've been doing it thus far, this is the book. I've basically used and reused a handful of the recipes, but after nearly three weeks, I can definitely tell the difference in how I feel. I can't say I've ever really stuck with an eating plan without ""cheating"" until this one."
5,Incredible!,"I had the mindset that this would be hard to do, but it was actually easier than I thought. I felt incredible after the first few days and my skin looked awesome! I didn't tell anyone what I was doing, and I started getting compliments. That's a personal success right there."
3,In touch??,"I read this book in a few hours and really liked what she had to say. A little overwhelming but seemed to make sence and that she seemed very informed. Then I got to page 47 to a quote that completly made me lose all faith in her and how in touch with the world she really is. ""Of course, virtually no one in this country actually knows what it is to go hungry"" Really? Really?"
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it would be about food and recipes. Turns out that two of the important steps to this particular diet are colonic hydration and food combining. It would have been very helpful if that information had been presented when the book was described. Since I wasn't interested in either of those things, the entire diet lost its luster."
3,"Good information, but...","This book is valuable in that it presents an approachable way to ""detox"" and eat in a way that's healthful for most of the population. That's a big distinction to make, however, in that there are some people for whom this diet needs to be tempered with more information. I'm thinking specifically of those with preexisting conditions like pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome, which is likely more common in the general population than many of us are aware. I hope that Natalia Rose will add more information to a future edition for people in such situations. They may experience symptoms or have special needs that aren't addressed in the book. This is not to say the book isn't valuable, only that it needs an addendum, in my opinion."
2,Raw? Really?,I was disappointed when I started going through the recipies section of the book. They are not all raw. There are quite a few recipies that require cooking. If you are looking for an all raw foods book. This is not it.
5,The Raw Food detox Diet,Love the book...received it in only 3 daysChanged my life..I see better & feel 20 years younger
1,Terrible Reading...,"Unfortunatly this book is terribly written. I found the book juicing for life to contain many more juice recipies, and be much more readable. Skip this purchase or don't and end up posting a similar review to this one."
2,The Starvation Diet,"I didn't research this very thoroughly before I purchased it, but I was hoping for a guide to more healthy eating through raw foods. While the basis of this book is on point--eating less processed foods and fresh fruits and vegetables--the implementation seems lacking to me. In fact, it seems like a ""starvation diet.""The lack of sources in the book also scares me. It makes me feel like this author could have just made all this information up (like the ""food groups"") or that there's little supporting evidence.As a vegetarian who works 10-hour days and is very active outside of work, there is no way I could survive on this diet. I'd lose most of my sources of protein and probably pass out during any exercise.I wish I'd done more research before purchasing this book. I wouldn't recommend it as a healthy eating guide for anyone looking to lose weight or slim down. There are better resources out there that actually let you eat in a healthy way."
2,Not great for the serious raw foodist,"While this can be helpful for the average person looking to improve their health a little by eating healthier, it isn't a great book for those looking to get more serious about their health and for more details about coverting to a raw diet. It's not a bad book, but there is a lot of information missing and it seems to encourage you to still eat a lot of unhealthy foods. The recipes are okay, not great and not all raw. There is some useful information, but might be confusing to most. There are better books out there regarding the raw diet."
1,MAY CONTAIN LEAD PAINT,I got this as a gift and it looked nice enough for a simple cocktail shaker. After I opened it to use it for the first time I found a sticker on the bottom that mentions the paint in the product may contain Lead which is conveniently left out of the packaging and online descriptions. I returned it immediately. I was amazed that it is even legal to sell kitchen equipment used in food/drink preparation that may contain Lead and just thought I'd let others know.
1,Sucks. Save Your Money.,"The rubber gasket does not stay on the glass. The minute the glass is wet, the rubber seal just slides right off the top. After I washed the glass and tried to use it, I literally coud not get the rubber to stay on - it would spring off the top of the glass all by itself. Utterly useless."
1,Only one pen...really?,It clearly says there are a dozen pens included but when I opened the box there was one lone purple pen in it. I am returning it and hopefully can find them somewhere else. The pen itself is very cute.
3,Rosehip Honey,"Good tasting honey. A little expensive considering the amount and price. If you are looking for a tasty alternative, you can't go wrong with this."
1,Hurt My Back,"This DVD really hurt my back. I did the easier of the Yin workouts and my back hurt for two days. I would not recommend this dvd.Baron Baptise, Kathy Smith and/or Bryan Kest if your looking for a good yoga workout that won't cause pain."
4,very good stretching!,Normally I like more vigorous exercise but this DVD is very good for stretching and improving flexibility! That is the reason why I got it on first place. The only bit that sometimes bothers me is his constant repeating of what he already has said few seconds ago... Otherwise the poses are well explained and modifications are also offered. I use it often.
5,Yin yoga,"I have been using this for several weeks, it is very soothing to do though it will make you sore. Need to take a day off after yin yoga and let your body recover. I did with my 19 year old daughter and now she wants her own copy. (She is in college)Paul explains very well and the hour goes fast. I don't do a couple poses- saddle and snail. Saddle because I am not flexible enough and snail because I have a herniated cervical disc. As a substitute for saddle, I sit upright on folded legs and for snail I do a seated forward bend. I highly recommend."
5,Wonderful!,"I have only just started out with this, to me, new form of yoga but I love it and my body loves me for loving it. I can highly recommend it!"
3,A bit repetitive...,"I found the narrative a bit repetitive, glad there are the options to turn off the audio or do the slideshow. Sometimes I don't have 70 minutes to devote to this (plus the yang yoga), so I end up doing just a partial workout."
5,excellent,"Paul Grilley is great.I sought out yin yoga because my flexibility diminished after an injury and I sat around too longwaiting for it to heal. I was unsuccessful with standard stretching and realized my connective tissue was too stubborn to let go.Enter Yin Yoga. Paul Grilley does a great job guiding you through these poses. If you have tightness in your back and/or hips,the results are wonderful.I do recommend a yoga bolster for yin yoga so you can be supported while relaxing into a pose.The less flexible you are, the fatter the bolster."
3,Yin yoga,"He gives thourough explanations of what his message is. I was disappointed that he used only young, very flexible models in wonderful athletic shape. There was no consideration that we are an aging nation, and a nation that is not (overall) in great athletic condition. The poses are held for a long time, but for much of that time the camera is on the narrator and when we are doing the workout if we look up to see an example of what he is talking about, we only see a man talking, not a person doing the pose. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is over 40 or who has any medical problems."
4,Yin,"I love to teach Yin Yoga, so I wanted to have this DVD to help further my teaching. So far I've gotten a lot out of it."
3,Make your point already!,Its a good enough Yin Yoga DVD but the guy drives me crazy with his incessant talking and inability to come to a point succinctly. The instructional DVD could be cut in half if he'd just make his point and move on.
2,Below expectations,"Not being a huge fan of Alphaville, I expected more of this compilation. Definitely go for other titles."
1,PENN Dutch Inn has seen better days!,"Tamar Meyers needs to get a better story line. This whole story was to hurried, poor attempt to be funny, and it misses the point. The language was boring and plot weak, was a formula of other books but not as well done, I am tired of hearing about the husband that wasn't a husband, about the same people and the whole book not up to the standards of the other Penn Dutch Books."
1,Unbelievable bad!,"I received three books from this series as a gift. I have to wonder if the person that gave them to me did it as a passive-agressive form of punishment. All three books(including this one)were terrible. Every book in this series seems to have the same awful one-liners. It takes way to long to develop anything even remotely resembling a plot. You can't even figure out when the ""mystery"" has been solved because you haven't even realized one began. The main character is completely unlikeable. I just wanted her to be murdered to end the misery that is this series. I am a huge mystery buff and I have never disliked any books so much. This auther is horrible."
1,The most ridiculous book I've ever started reading!,This book is the silliest pile of nonsense I have ever run across. If you've got nothing better to do with your time than read one of the Penn Dutch Inn books then you've got more time than good sense.
4,Tamar Myers keeps me laughing!,"Once again, Tamar Myers has brought her Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries with recipes to life. Magdalena and her sister are hilarious (although Sis is more in the background this time), as are the rest of the characters. The recipes always look extremely yummy, but I'm not a cook. Why only 4 stars? I got really overdosed on the references to Spam the name-brand food product. But I still can't wait to start the next book. If you're a Myers fan (I think ""Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth"" was the first in this series), you'll also like her Den of Antiquity books. ."
3,Spam,"I have not read the other Penn Dutch mysteries but the Spam in the title caught my eye. Magdalena was funny, especially with the nicknames but she talked about her ex-husband too much. I enjoyed Strubly Sam and the other characters. The mystery was too rushed which is why I give it only 3 stars. Had there been more focus on the mystery and sleuthing throughout the book and less about the ex-husband it would have rated higher."
4,Magdalena Funny Again.,"In this book, Magdalena is funny again. Some of the humour in the last few books has seemed forced and slapstick, but in this book Magdalena is her usual hilarious self. The book also has a little thicker plot than usual as Magdalena gets drawn into a reunion of World War II vets who have rented out rooms in her newly rebuilt inn. (the first inn was apparently destroyed by a tornado sometime between this book and the one previous). We also meet a new character that I hope we see more of - Strubbly Sam. He's wonderful - an Amish widower who may be after Magdalena (and he cooks too). I am looking forward to other books in this series again."
5,Love these trucks!,"Your kids will love this car/truck! We have all of the off-road Shake n' Go cars and play with them all the time. They can drive over just about anything (unlike the regular shake n'go's) and they are very durable! I got hooked on these after buying a used one at a Mom 2 Mom sale, and it's still going strong after 4 years! My boys aren't gentle with them either, so it goes to show how well made these are. You will not be disappointed in these! Item arrived in perfect condition and in a reasonable amount of time."
2,Janelle Denison saves the anthology.,"I was expecting the anthology to be good, sadly it was not. I gave the book a two only because of Janelle Denison. Her story was the best out of the three. MaryJanice's was just too weird and farfetched (a ghost and a human stay together). Nina Bangs had too many supernatural beings vying for their place in her story. The talking cats, wizards, vampires, and even a wereshark make the story not only annoying but too paranormal for my tastes. I guess I was expecting too much from this anthology. You are better off reading it at the bookstore or borrowing it. Do not waste your $14 on this book, not really worth it."
1,Did nothing!,I used this for a month and it was basically like spraying water in my mouth; no effect whatsoever.
1,Disappointing DVD,This DVD was more of a documentary not an instructional video on how to teach yoga to children. I was very disappointed
2,Sleepytime...,"This music is good for falling asleep only. I picked it up at the library, thinking that this is something like Chet Atkins, or at any rate some twangy country rock, but alas... the fellow has no spark at all. The material selected here requires some skill, and Mr Norman has it, but he has the tendency to play everything at a soporific tempo. Even the surf rockers like Pipeline and Ghost Riders in the Sky are just dragging along on their way to bed. The slow songs sound like elevator music from the 1950`s. This Cd is guaranteed to cure insomnia, so buy this and throw away your Immovane."
1,Eureka 409B the Boss Superlite Widetrack,"Having had two expensive vacuum cleaners break I decided to buy this cheapie, but I just tried it and think it was a mistake. The noise is horrendous, more dirt and hair ended up on the rollers than in the dust cup and it blows so much air out it feels like a fan. At least I won't have wasted as much money when it breaks."
1,Works great until flap breaks!!!,"The vacuum works great. We used it mostly for dog hair on wood floors.The one way flap inside the canister is a flimsy rubber piece attached with clips to two, even flimsier, thin plastic posts. The first time it broke, Eureka sent me a new one. The second time they wanted $19.95 plus shipping for the part. That's almost 50% of what they sell for new.They could make the plastic posts thicker, but I guess they want a disposable vacuum. Or they make good money on parts. It's a sad commentary on product quality. I'd like to ask the engineer who designed it why it's so flimsy. But then again, the engineer probably got it right, but the bean counters figured they could save five cents."
4,For the price not bad at all!,"Great suction power! My only complaint is that the handle won't stay put so it slides down. If you have back problems or if you're tall this vacuum may not be for you, but other than that it does the job!"
4,A good middle size vacuum cleaner,"I was warned by other reviewers that this was a screechy number, so I put in my earplugs and no problem.It is a very good compromise between the huge standard uprights or canister vacs and the handy handhelds, which also have their uses. It is well designed, light weight and its dust bin is transparent, so you really know when you have to empty it."
1,It stops working...,"When I first got this vacuum, it worked great and really sucked up everything. But after 2-3 months, it just stopped sucking.. I took it in to the service center and they told me that the filter had to be cleaned (which I already did)- I took it home and it still didn't suck good enough. Don't waste your money on this one..."
4,great for what I need it for,"I bought this vacuum because I only have three small rooms with carpet to vacuum. The rest of the house is hardwood, although I'm sure I'll use it on the hardwood also. So far, so good. It picks up alot for a little vacuum. It is really light and easy to maneuver. It sure is noisy though! That's why I give it only four stars."
1,Bad in every way...,"The Eureka ""the boss"" superlite is so incredibly loud that I cannot use it without ear plugs. I cleaned two bathroom floors and my ears are literally still ringing and they hurt. The piercing scream has to be damaging to one's ears. If you need a second reason to avoid this product, cleaning it out is the nastiest mess. Everything sticks to the filter and flies in your face when you open the canister to dump it out. Today is the first time I've tried to use it and it goes immediately into the Good Will box."
4,screamer,"Great little picker-upper of dirt, animal hair, etc.on plain or carpeted floors, but it is a srceamer when it comes to noise. It gets the four stars from me for that reason."
4,Great little vacuum!,While this vac does not have tremendous power -- it is enough to satisfy my needs. For our small space it does a good job. Price is right.
1,SUCKS!! No pun intended!!!,My brother in law bought this vacuum for my husband and I two years ago. This Machine has so much trouble picking up anything!! Also Its getting harder and harder to click the plastic piece that you empty (which is very frequent may i add!) I'm looking for something better now. I don't think I'll be buying any more Eureka vacuums!!
4,Handy Dandy Little Vac,"I got this Eureka 409B to replace the same one I used to have that was yellow in color. This is the same little vacuum, new red color, and does a very good job on carpets and laminated flooring. Somehow, this one in red doesn't seem to be as solidly made as the old yellow one. Hard to describe. The handle is harder to lock in a stand-up position, but it will do it. It seems a tad bit noisier than my old one. Incidentally, it's my fault that the old one died. I left it in a hall closet that was near the air-conditioner and it dried out the moving parts, causing the little vac to short out and ruin the motor. I would recommend this vac to anyone who needs frequent clean-ups with good suction."
4,Super good buy,This vaccum works great and doesn't make any more noise than any other vaccum I've encountered. Maybe there is a stealth vaccum I don't know about. It picks up pretty much everything but the little filter on top of the canister you empty out confuses me a bit. I just need to pick up the instruction manual I'm guessing. The only things that would make it better is if the cord was easier to wrap up and if there were a hose attachment. But hey for $50 I can't really complain.
1,Poor Quality Control,Followed setup instructions exactly and still didn't get it to work. Documentation is limited. No mention of entering passcodes in instructions. One of the units would not accept the passcode assigned to it. Found 1 bad USB cable included with unit. Units will only work if everything is on the same 110 volt leg of the house wiring.
4,Sackleton's Adventure,"Not sure whether we are reviewing the service, condition of the book or a critique of the book. Service was excellent. Copy received is fine; it replaced a copy in poor condition. I read the book years ago and needed a good copy for stories I am writing on 18th and 19th century ships sailing in the Antarctic region and thru the Horn. Will read it again later as I go to work on the stories."
4,Another Harry Shearer Satire,"Hey! Let's make fun of the idle rich and politicians than run this country! Great fun and great satire from harry Shearer and his warped mind! This film did so-so in the theaters, but has a chieved a cult following thanks to harry Shearer. Get it and be prepared to laugh at all the stereotypes of the idle rich."
1,*DIS-INFO ALERT*,"maybe shearer thinks he is on the money , but after seeing all the evidence all I can call this is dis-information at its finest. Go watch Alex Jone's infiltration of Bohemian Grove first or read up on the grove from historians. Shearer is obviously ignorent although i do like how he tries to take swipes at Mr. Jones"
5,Love Sid!,"I think Sid the Science Kid is an adorable show as do my boys, so I knew they would enjoy this one. It is a show about a kindergarten class that uses science to learn. There are four friends, each different and unique, but all best friends. This DVD is especially neat because it is all about weather, which is a hard subject to explain to kids, at least to my 3 year old! The episodes cover rain and clouds, using sunscreen and the sun, snow and cold temperatures, and wind! Sid has some great adventures in these episodes and the show really does explain science in a way for young kids to understand. There is also lots of singing involved, which is quite cute! Overall, I would recommend this DVD to any parent looking for ways to help their children understand why rain is okay, what clouds really are (no not cotton candy!), why sunscreen is important, how cold weather can be fun, and how wind can be fun (flying kites!)"
3,Not what I expected.,"I would have liked the item to have been more clearly described as a book for a SIX year old and not a five year old-- since that is how the book ends. A more exhaustive preview of the book would've been helpful too, as there was a page that I did not find appropriate for a five-year-old to be reading but did not see it ahead of time due to the limited preview. Item arrived clean and neat though, as described."
5,Great Book,Perfect book for a 5 year old boy ... My son loved it and keep going back to it ... This is a keeper.
2,Great Mentor Text to teach Writing,"I found this book as part of a writing lesson for my fourth graders. One of a couple books that I chose, it is repetitive enough for lower elementary, too. It lacks some oomph, but working with other books it fills the lesson with some examples."
5,super cute,We bought this as a gift & they just thought they were adorable. Bigger than we expected so no problem with a pizza fitting on them
2,"Unfortunately, a disappointment","After thoroughly enjoying Mitsou's French language albums, I was eager to listen to her first complete English release. Her French albums contained charming, infectious pop and dance songs that were a pleasure to listen to, even though I didn't understand all of the words. However, ""Tempted"" proved to be a big disappointment. The songs themselves just aren't very good. The upbeat, infectious quality of her French songs is totally missing here. Also, she can't speak English. Her pronunciation is so terrible, it distracts the listener. Mitsou has never been a great singer--it was her charming presence and perhaps the romantic French language that made her songs appealing. When she sings in English, it emphasizes how weak her voice really is. There are a couple of fun songs, including ""Everybody Say Love"", but overall, this is a mediocre album at best. Anyone wanting to purchase a Mitsou album should try ""El Mundo"" instead."
2,Good Music but encumbered,This CD is full of really awsome music. The songs are amazing so full of life and the the singer has an amazing voice.To bad it has DRM in it. The CD will not play easily on Windows XP though with Linux it has no problem. In theory you are supposed to install some special software to play the CD. This CD has problem with windows XP. It works fine on my car cd player but a single scratch could make it usless since they removed the error correction code to try and stop piracy. The CD violates the Redbook standard and as such does not have the CDDA labels on.Beware of [Enhanced] CDs!Again its awsome music... if you can get it to play.
4,Great new music!,"I too went to see Blue Man Group, and was very pleasantly surprised by Venus Hum, the opening band that I'd never heard of before. I immediately bought the CD (and a shirt)! I have to strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that the ""overtly christian lyrics"" turned him off. I find no such overt lyrics here. The words are more a celebration of nature than anything religious. (Of course for some people that may be the same thing, so take it how you like, but don't be scared off thinking the lyrics are all about god/jesus/religion. THEY ARE NOT!) This is just beautiful, fun, catchy music and a nice change of pace from any other recent releases."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"Like a lot of people, I first heard of Venus Hum when Annette Strean (Venus Hum's lead singer) sang ""Feel so good"" on the Blue man group's ""Complex rock tour"" (a gread DVD). They announced her as Venus Hum. She rocked the house down and was the highlight of the show. So I figured that was the kind of music Venus Hum played. It's not. They're more like Techno-pop or something.The first few songs are kind of catchy, hence the 2 stars; but it drops off quickly after that. Guess I should have listed to the short audio clips on Amazon first."
5,Perfect music to work/relax/drive/dance/anything to,"I first saw Venus Hum on the Blueman Group's ""The Complex Rock Tour LIVE"". 'I Feel Love' totally blew me away. The power and quality of her voice was simply amazing... If you haven't seen 'The Complex' video, do so immediately! I got my hands on Big Beautiful Sky, and I just can't belive I haven't heard this group before. I have heard lots of comparisons to Bjork... in my humble opinion, Venus Hum is far superior."
4,Not bad,"Normally, Titus doesn't bring much into the gameworld especially with dissapointments like Superman. Xena is the chosen one for now. Bad thing is that this game gets boring fast. It's probably more fun to have 4 players. However, the God mode is really hard, I would recommend some of you to try it out and let me know if you could beat it. Because I couldn't. Have a nice day."
1,rent it instead,"This is a very limited game that might be fun for children but not for adults. It provides, at the most, a couple of hours of entertainment. Buy the Playstation game instead."
5,Very Nice Game,This game is very cool but hard in god mode. It is hard but it was worth all the trouble i took to find it.
1,You don't want this game,"imagine Mortal Kombat. Now take away most of the characters, give each reamaining character only 2 moves and crappy 5 hit max combos, give them no plot. There now you have Xena."
5,Best fighter for N64,"This game is extremely true to the Xena television show. Accurate characters, environments, effects, and overall style from the series will strongly appeal to any fan of the show. At the same time, the unique and astoundingly fun four-player modes make this fighter stand above the rest of the field on the N64. If you love the show or you love a good multi-player brawl, buy this game."
5,Excellent! Best Fighting Game Ever!,"If you like Xena the show, you'll love this game. It has all the main characters and special moves that they do in the show. If there are two players playing and you both choose the same character it will give you a different version of that character which makes it great fun!"
2,i love xena but....,this was just a fight game. there was really no goal to it at all exept to fight all of the charecters and then fight the champion of dahak (all of which are very easy may i add). it doesnt present much of a challenge at all. it would be alot better if xena went on a quest or something.the charecters were accuarate... how they looked and thier fighting skills and all. some of thier moves are pretty cool.
2,GOOD PRICE BAD GAME,There is realy no other way to put it except to say it's just another boring one-one game don't buy it unless you like those type of games
2,Dont waste your $$$$,"This was the second RoadPro unit that I tried, as the first one came to me as a previous return from another customer. Now I know why it was returned....don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk! Although the temperature part of this unit seemed to work fine, I was never able to get a calibration on the compass. tried several times, tried replacement battery, tried different mount positions, IT WOULD NOT WORK! I ended up going ""old school"" with a mechanical ""bubble type"" compass."
4,RDC Review,The Roadpro Digital Compass arrived in excellent shape and in a short delivery time. Its' features as advertised are easily set and the unit is very adequate in size and the information display can be quickly seen at a glance. It replaces a smaller unit and I'm pleased with the size and extra information it conveys.Glad to have purchased this unit.
2,"Roadpro Digital Compass with Time, Temp and Ice Alert 3AAA","I'm sending this unit back without ever installing it since upon reading the instructions, I discovered the sensor range is 32F to 140F. I am interested in temps below 32F (0C), therefore the unit is not useful to me."
1,Whoops,"Well, we were hoping by the advertisement that it would work but unfortunately the only thing that was accurate was the time and direction. The temp displays inside the car only even though it was set according to the instructions and not outside which was the purpose. Live and learn."
1,Wish I could give it NO stars!,"What a terrible product! Before I'd had it 6 months, the thermometer function had stopped working and before we hit the one year mark, the whole thing crapped out. All in all, a colossal waste of money."
5,Great value,"This is a great deal for the cost. The unit was easy to install and set up. All of the functions work accurately. The compass is responsive and sensitive. The backlight is pleasing and stays on for the right amount of time when pressed. What could be better? - operate off of 12V - but you'd need a cord, remote sensor - costs a lot more, and a back light that stays on - drains the batteries too soon. Overall, I'm pleased!"
3,Digital Compass,I would have liked the product review to state that it can not be used with a DC plug in adapter. The back light in my opinion is useless. The Celsius toFahrenheit switch works only part time. The compass works well when it can beseen in the daytime. The instruction sheet should have been written by someone whohas a good working knowledge of the English language.
1,Erratic readings,"The unit is nice looking and fit nicely in my car. However after a couple of alignments, the unit continued to give erroneous reading especially while stopped at a traffic light. Perhaps the power lines were affecting it.I have had 2 vehicles that had a compass built in and there was no erratic opertion with those units.I returned the unit to Amazon.com and got a full refund. I was pleased with Amazon's service. Tim Brown"
2,High Expectations That Did Not Live Up,"Had high expectations for this due to some of the reviews. However, no matter where I place the outside temp sensor, it is always way off. The interior sensor just gives you what the dashboard temp is. So, if the sun is baking on the dash then the thing reads the interior temp as 110 degrees. The outside is always off by at least 10 degrees, usually more.All that said, but there are some good points. First, it is small enough to fit on the dashboard without notice. It has a good compass and the digital clock is useful as well. So, if you want to pay a bunch of money for a good compass and digital clock, here it is. But, I would look elsewhere first."
4,RoadPro Compass,"The only problem was that there weren't any instructions for installing the temperature sensor. RoadPro's website offered no help. We called our local AutoZone, and they were able to explain it over the phone. Otherwise, it seems to be working well after one day."
2,DIRECTIONAL AND TEMPERATURE BOX,"I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I HAD TO SEND MY FIRST ONE BACK AS THE OUTSIDE SENSOR FOR THE TEMPERATURE BROKE AND STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 DAYS AND THEY SENT ME ANOTHER ONE AND THE ONE I HAVE NOW IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE HAS BROKEN AGAIN AND DOES NOT WORK AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO THIS TIME IT TOOK 10 DAYS AND I AM DEALING WITHOUT IT BUT, I THINK I MIGHT GET SOMETHING ELSE. I DO LIKE THE OTHER THINGS IF OFFERS LIKE THE DIRECTIONAL NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST WORKS GREAT AND WAS SIMPLE TO SET UP. ALSO THE INSIDE TEMPERATURE WORKS GREAT AND THE TIME WORKS GREAT TO ITS JUST THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE SENSOR THING BUT, IF YOU DONT WANT THAT THEN IT IS GREAT FOR YOU AS THE REST OF THE STUFF ON IT WORKS PERFECTLY."
4,The one that almost got away,I had such hard time finding this litle gadge that i almost give up but i though well i need it and whent from site to site till i found it and order it.the reason for this is that im new in this town and i just want to know where im standing this compss is greate and im happy for amazone .com thanks.
3,It's okay,"Not great, the temperatures need a calibration knob or something, the temps read a consistent 12deg higher than they should and there should be a way to, without modification, plug or wire this into your car. It uses only batteries."
2,disappointed,"I wanted this to show the temperature so I would be aware of freezing. Unfortunately, the temperature is 10 to 15 degrees higher than actual so it's not helpful as ice alert doesn't go off. Thought I installed correctly but maybe not..."
2,"display ""burned out""","The clock works just fine, I have no use for the compass so I never turned it on. What I wanted this for was the thermostat and that's pretty much useless. If the sun hits it the temperature display soars. That's correctable though, just move it (a lot). However, and this is why its getting only 2 stars, the ""inside"" temperature display no longer displays the left side of the left digit. So, if the the temperature is say, 80, the display will say 10 because it can't display the left side of the 8!"
2,"Great, but???","Works well, however the velcro tape was so strong it broke off the battery door when I tested it.... But works good..."
1,poor quality,"Do not buy this product. The thermometer is 15 degree's off. The thermometer is worthless. Poor design to attach to your dash. The compass works well, clock works well but I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Roadpro Digital Compass,My wife missed having a compass and temperature gauge on our car. I bought one for her birthday and liked the product until I opened it to find absolutely NO instructions on how to install it. It is still after 2 months sitting on our table waiting for me to figure out how to install it. I'm trying to find someone who can help me but no luck so far. I Googled the product and saw that the majority of people buying this product feel the same way I do. If you're are going to have a product made in China then be sure it has information on how to install it! I would't recommend this product even if it does end up working well because of the lack of instruction. Feeling burned!
4,Love it!,I love this item! My hubby bought it for me after 10 years of asking for one. I never know my direction and this helps me a ton. It is totally accurate for me. The only thing I don't like is I have to remember to turn it off to save batteries. It is a nice unit for a vehicle that didn't come with a built in compass and for an person like me who doesn't know North from South unless I really think about where I am on a map and go from there.
3,After market auto air temp/compass.,"Product works fine. Inside temperature reading is overkill. What good is knowing the temperature of your ""hot"" dashboard? Wish I could disconnect the outside temperature lead from the console. I guess the clock is good if your car clock does not work."
5,Healthy cooks,"Product is awesome. Better than any other brand I have tried. So convenient to have on hand for multiple uses. I whipped up a quick salad for lunch today, using canned salmon, these artichokes, little chopped onion, red bell pepper, lemon juice, small amount of mayo, pepper & dill. So delicious and so healthy.. Lots of good fiber."
5,Yummy,I can't believe I'm going to write this review. But...these are the only type of artichoke hearts I will use. I have this wonderful recipe for artichoke soup. We have tried to make this recipe using other artichokes that have other name brands on them. These are the ones that we find make the best soup for our tastes.
4,Good Supplement for a Salad,Love to chop it up and put it in my salad. Tastes good. I purchased a dozen at a time.
3,let the buyer beware,"This two cd set is actually two versions of the same album. The original one, The Blues of Otis Spann, with Muddy Waters on guitar, is a very stripped down, minimal, rough-hewn gem. Not as good as Otis Spann is the Blues, or Biggest thing since Colossus (or his work on Buddy Guys' A Man and the Blues - which is reallly astounding), it's still pretty good. Cracked Spanner Head is a remix of the Blues album with a lot of reverb, etc. added. It is not an improvement. HOWEVER, Crack Spanner includes 4 extra tracks, three of which were from the original BLues session. Why they didn't just add these to The BLues of Otis Spann and release what would have been a great single cd, is beyond me."
3,Poor translation...,"Dynamic Technical Analysis is written by one of France's most prominent technicians.The ideas presented within the book aren't bad. In fact, they are interesting and potentially useful. Unfortunately, due to the book's poor translations, simple ideas become very difficult to comprehend. This is not the translator's fault, really. He is obviously not a trader.The field of Technical Analysis has its own lingo in English, and non-standard terms were used in the book. This causes great confusion, and makes ideas more difficult to comprehend than necessary.My second complaint is the price of this thin book. It is way too expensive for the material presented!"
2,Unclear description,"The Zalman website states that this CPU fan fits to Socket-A. But it is not true if your motherboard doesn't have ""heat-sink holes"". Unless you go read the manual carefully, you can't find this information."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This ""book"" is described as ""hardcover"". It is a couple of PAGES out of the actual BOOK, printed on COASTERS! The ""book's"" content is highly abridged since only a few pages are included. I give this product idea negative one star."
1,Doesn't Work,I tried this on a stubborn plantar's wart that I have had for over a year. I used it as directed. It didn't work at all. I wish I could get my money back.
3,Great styling but no body schematics,"The sweaters in this book are very stylish, fashionable and close-fitting and would be especially suited for the young hip set (who have the figures to wear them!) My only complaint is that the patterns aren't accompanied by body schematics which most kniting patterns have these days. If one is short-waisted or long-waisted or if your row gauge is off and one needs to change where the side shaping occurs it is much easier with body schematic showing measurements. Instead the pattern instructions tell you to increase or decrease at specific rows which is OK if your bust and waist hits where the model's does and if your row gauge exactly matches theirs."
5,Beginner Knitter,"I taught myself how to knit this past summer (8 months ago), and began with scarves and hats. When I came across this book I was a bit daunted, but was just so in love with the patterns I had to try! I am currently finishing my second sweater pattern out of this book and am in love with both of them. I happen to be wearing the first one now actually. I found the instructions easy to follow generally, with just a few hang ups with jargon. But otherwise, I plan on making at least 80% of the patterns in this book.I love it! I reccommend this book to anyone who loves to see their work completed!I know another comment was on discontinued yarns, but I always choose yarns I like with colors I like. If you are picking a a different yarn than the one they reccommend just be sure you have the same gauge.Have fun!"
1,"Vintage? More like ""vintage inspired""","Reading other reviews, I heartily agree with the problems of this book. I've just checked it out and I'm glad not to have paid for it! I'm a small girl myself, so no size problems...but really all the fab style details I was hoping for are not there!I appreciate confusing old patterns being modernized, but really these are so far modernized as to lose their vintage charm. Some of the patterns I wouldn't recognize as being vintage style at all. The beaded sweater is especially maddening--the original has the daintiest collar, pretty shaping and is so cute. The modern version? not really anything special. I've seen other books that gave the original pattern too--I'd have sorely appreciated that here so I could hybridize the two patterns a bit!In short...request this from your local library like I did or get on Ravelry for your vintage sweater fix!"
5,"Sexy, Modern, and WONDERFUL!","I know that this book has been out for a while. But, I'm just waking up to it. There are a few things about this book that really pull it out from the others for me. First, they take old photos from magazines and ads - all the patterns are based off these old photos. So, you get a great feeling for where they are coming from. Second, they have a bit of a modern flair to them. This is wonderful. Lastly, I want to make every single item in this book. It isn't often that I open a book and desire EVERYTHING. But, this is one of them. The patterns range in difficulty and I promise that you will find something in this book to love."
3,For small women only,"Be warned that the patterns in this book are sized for 32"", 34"" and 36"" chest measuremenets. Most of the patterns are very close fitting, so there's not much ease to work with if you're a bigger size. If you're comfortable resizing patterns, then I would recommend this book because the patterns are fabulous and very much the style of what young adult women are wearing. But if you just want to follow the printed pattern, you're going to have to make a pretty small sweater.Also, nearly all the patterns call for Rowan yarn, which is quite expensive. Once again, if you're comfortable with yarn substitution or have plenty of money to spend on knitting, this will be fine. But the price of the recommended yarn might be discouraging to some people."
5,Buy this book!!,"I just received my copy of this and I am in love. There are at least 10 patterns in here I must make for myself. If you love vintage or classic knit styles, this book is a must have. The pictures are beautiful and the instructions seem to be clearly written. This is also a great book for younger knitters, the patterns are classic, but very stylish and fun. There are several cute lacy tops and camisoles, and a great basic ribbed cardie. I can't wait to get started knitting one of these! I wish there were more books out there like this one."
3,Warning,"While these patterns are beautiful, there are at least two major problems with the directions. Every sweater in multiple colors has a color key that does NOT have the symbols coded to match the pattern grid. Unless you want to compare the color photos with the grid and color it in yourself (risking errors), you might as well skip at least five of these projects. The next project I selected said ""Change to moss st and continue..."" There is no description in the pattern or the book of the moss stitch. These are the obvious problems at first read -- I fear starting a project for those errors that may be less obvious. The color key problem was identified by a reviewer on September 4, 2002 at publishers website, along with a plea for assistance. It appears no one has responded. Again, the patterns are absolutely lovely, just poorly written."
2,Important Sizing Information!!!,"Ladies,If you have more than an A/B cup bra size, don't bother buying this book. The sizes run from Small (32"") - Large (36""). I am a woman who wears a 34D bra size = 38"" bust measurement. Although the patterns are a creative update on some very lovely vintage looks, there is not a sweater pattern in this book that I could knit and wear. I believe that the largest finished bust measurement was 38"" providing no room movement in the design/styling of the sweater, many of the patterns for a 36"" bust measurement are a finished 36"" bust measurement. Very disappointing. I would have thought that a woman designer would realize that ""real"" women don't actually have the bodies of their pre-pubescent models. However, if your measurements do fall within this range...lucky you. Enjoy!"
5,Great gift for friends,"Wow, I just bought this book for all my friends for a holiday gift. It fits in an envelope too. It really works and it's much more fun than therapy. It's the twist on ""he loves me- loves me not"" without the destruction to a daisy."
5,Great gift for Girlfriends,I came across this book in a small boutique in Bermuda. I glanced through it in the store and knew I had to buy them for all of my friends!! I think this would be a great book for recent graduates going off to college or out in the real world. It is a fun book that will certainly appeal to all kinds of people as everyone likes to test fate a little bit and see where their relationships are headed. I would DEFINITELY recommend this book.
5,Wonderful!,Great tool to have in the wallet. I frequently forget to take my reading glasses with me. This is very handy for reading menus and small print.
1,The Main Problem with WCW Mayhem,"I agree with Most of the Disses with WCW Mayhem but I don't understand why no one noticed what I noticed about the game.First of all it's that People are unique we all Act and do things our own way. Case in point WCW Mayhem All wrestlers should Have different taunts and Mannerisms but, in This game every wrestler has the same taunts. They Probobly put all their efforts into making the wrestlers look good(which they also didn't do a good job of) but, still that's no excuse. Judging by the lameness of this game, I'd say they lazily slopped this game together and caring only about the look of the wrestlers, said ""Hey lets not worry about making them different, people we'll be so impressed by the awesome graphics they won't notice""Conclusion: Wcw is not worth the time and money you spend on it to Rent it Much less buy it."
2,WCW Mayhem: UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!,"WCW STINKS. At least that's what most WWF, ECW, and other wrestling fans believe, and from the looks of this game, they're right. The only fun thing about this game is the 4-man battle royal. Everything else, the character designs, the entrances, the bizarre physics of contact (I punch while you're a mile away; you feel it) just smell worse than... Santa after a rowdy elf party. Stay away from this game... it gets one star for the battle royal, and the other for just booting up when you turn it on. Go buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater."
4,I got shocked when I first played it...,"When I first picked this game up, I got scared because I thought I already had it, I went to the Create-A-Wrestler portion, and I was already on the memory card, it turns out that created wrestlers from WCW Backstage Assault can be used in this and vice versa, this in itself is quite a step forward, seeing as there hasn't been anything similar since, in a series of wrestling games...The game itself is okay, the gameplay is kind of easy, and really slow-paced (ie. it looks like its in slow motion at some points.) But for the time, and for WCW/EA's resources, I find it to be very ammusing.It is a recommended novelty wrestling game for the N64, its not comparable from WWF's No Mercy for the N64, because they are completely different, nothing at all, except for wrestling brings the two together."
2,I just hope EA gets better in future attempts...,"After being spoiled with THQ's classic WCW / nWo Revenge, this game was a pure dissapointment. The graphics were a little sharper, but the interaction was not good at all, and the controls were somewhat peculiar. The only reason I gave this game 2 stars was because Mayhem includes character entrance music. I play as Nash just so I can hear Wolfpac over and over and over.If you're looking for a good WCW / nWo game, go with Revenge. It may be a little older and out of date, but the game play is much better~~"
1,What were they thinking?,"This game was downright horrible and to think, they made a sequel. tsk tsk...... Im not sure exactly where they were going with this game, mabye they just messed up by tryign to move away from using polygons for graphics. And once again I see my fridn Mr.Da reviewed this game several times as he stuttered tapped the keyboard, I hope this isn't how he speaks, I hate internet speak and ebonics and his writing is just a combination of the 2, absolutely Horrid."
2,WCW Blows It Again,"This is one of the worst wrestling games ever made for the N64 game console. It puts itself on the list with WWF warzone and WWF Attitude. Wrestling Fans don't want a mortal kombat arcade game. They want a realistic game like Revenge or W2K. The games flaws include many glitches. It sure takes away from the expierence. The fighting options are basically the same as revenge. I give credit to the guys at EA for the biggest flaw. It is soooo unrealistic. Ex. You are Chris Beniot, you are fighting Goldberg, you start stomping on him and you get a special, it says finish him and you hit the special, then you are feeling a little froggy so you take him him out back and beat him with a weapon. You pin him and get a 1 count. When back in the ring minutes before he was done HUH? The only reason this game gets 2 stars is because it may be fun when you have a bunch of guys over..."
1,Not another bad game for Wcw,"Wcw has the record for the worst games. I have played about every single game for Wcw and they all stink, ths is the worst. If I was a Purchaser I wouldn't Buy this game. The graphics are so bad. Its like the original nintendo. The charecters don't even look like them. And it costs too much.The only reason I gave this game one star is because that was the lowest you could give it. Take it from me a 13 year old game freak, don't buy this game for anyone it is horrible. Buy Wrestlmania 2000, or ECW's new game."
5,Great stocking stuffer,This was a great stocking stuffer last year. We have 9 grandchildren and they all got different kinds and enjoyed them a lot.
4,Solid Shavers,"I have had a couple of bad expereinces with the ""Charlie Shavers Project"" Lone Hill Jazz reissues -- see my review ofComplete Intimate Interpretations. Overall though the three volumes that comprise the Complete Recordings of his quartet with pianist Ray Bryant have been solid. Volume 2 collects two sessions, one from October 10, 1959 and the other from July 1960, both recorded in New York with bassist Aaron Bell and drummer Roy Burns rounding out the group. To fill up the disc completely (to nearly 80 minutes of music), three live selections made in Paris in 1964 are included. Most of Shavers' tunes log in at under three minutes, so there definitely isn't much in the way of improvisational jams going on. But if you like your jazz short and sweet, then you'll enjoy getting close with Shavers."
4,A lot of Fun,"I enjoyed this little book.I started reading Frankowski's books several years ago starting with the time travel engineer to Poland books. I really enjoyed those. I thought this one might be similar to that. I was a bit dissapointed that it was not similar.However, this book is a very enjoyable read.It really makes you think. At the start of the book there are trees that are mutated into houses that people must live in. During the course of the book civilization as we know it ends and a new form of society is founded. Fauns educated children, vehicles are alive, and more fantastic things occur. The end is a particularly interesting end in that it leaves you thinking about our use of genetic engineering and so on.Enjoy."
2,Sunbeam 91640 Timer,Save your money. Too complicated to use. I much prefer the Taylor kitchen timer for kitchen use. The numbers on this unit are smaller and the functions are difficlt as it takes too many touches to set and use. The Talor has a nice stand and magnetic backing which is nicer too. This unit was a dissapointment and prompted me to purchase another Taylor 10 key.
3,Decent for the price - some annoyances,"The timer is easy to use, once you get the hang of setting the time (if you only want seconds, you need to input 00 first to get past the minutes). The alarm is loud and fairly piercing, so it won't be ignored even if you're a couple of rooms away. Two things I wish were better on it - a more powerful magnet so it didn't move so easy on the the metal, and a change to the ""stand"" mechanism built into the clip. It falls into place every time you remove the timer from whatever the magnet is holding on to, and then you've got to put it back before using the magnet again."
3,"Peforms v well, user friendly, loud, big display, but quite large",which makes it impossible to clip onto clothing-and clip is useless5 star if you dont need this function
1,very poor quality,"I bought this timer for its digital key pad so I can enter exact time in seconds, however this timer is in such an extremely poor quality and within one single usage it already went bad! when I pressed either the 0 or the 5 button the display went crazy and flashing with random numbers, the reset buttom nolonger works just after one single use, what a junk!!!"
3,Reasonable price---does what it should,I noticed some of the reviewers of this item said they would have liked a Power switch. One even went so far as removing the battery. I have a similar item which has lasted over ten years with the original battery---never turned off. So the lack of a power switch is not a problem.My only suggestion is a STOP switch on the top of the unit so you could simply hit it without pushing a button....something like a SNOOZE function on a clock.
4,"cheap, loud - counts up and down","It's cheap, loud and it counts up and down. That's pretty much what I expect from a kitchen timer.I like that it counts up as well as downThe magnet could be stronger - it barely holds on the fridge, and it can't be used to hold anything heavier than a small piece of paper.It's really loud, and it uses the same beep to announce that you hit a key. In a perfect world, it would have a quiet beep for hitting a key and a loud beep for alerts.I recommend it as a simple timer."
4,Sunbeam timer,"Over all good timer. I was able to disassemble the timers and paint the covers, so my kids could tell theirs apart from one another.Inputting the time is a little different from any other timer I have used. The plastic casing and buttons feel cheap, but I have not had any problems with any of the 4 timers I purchased. The clip and magnet on the back sticks out quite a bit and makes it unsteady when entering the numbers and it is stuck to the fridge.I have had them for about for about two months and all are working fine."
4,Nice and inexpensive but...,I bought 2 of these from Walmart and they were perfect. But the one I bought from Amazon had defective screen (hard to read) but I didn't returned it.
4,decent timer for the price,"I own a Timex timer with the number pad like this one, and was looking to add another one to my kitchen.This one works just like the Timex, but is rather ""fat"". It definitely sticks out FAR off the front of our refrigerator (about 1 to 2 inches) like one reviewer said, so you must make sure you don't brush it with your shoulder as you pass by, or you have to pick it up off the floor.The magnet can't seem to hold it in place while you press the buttons, so you DO have to hold it with your other hand.It is fine for what we use it for, but I will continue my quest for a more ""slim"" profile timer with a better, stronger magnet."
5,very helpful for getting things done,"I got this timer to help me be more efficient at work. Set it to 40-50 minutes at a time and keep working until it's done. No email, Facebook, MySpace, or anything like that. For me, it has been more helpful than dozens of ""get more done"" books."
4,Good Digital Timer,"This timer does its job just fine. I happen to really like it. It's user friendly, the buttons are easy to push, it's loud enough to hear, small enough to take with you to another room while something is cooking, and it has a magnet on the back to keep it on the fridge PLUS a little fold out stand on the back so you can place it upright on a counter or such.The only thing I don't like about it, is that when it is on the fridge you have to hold it while pressing the buttons. The stand on the back, even when folded away, makes it stick out from the fridge rather than flush with it. So if you firmly press the start button to the side the timer goes flying off the fridge. It now sounds a little funny after taking so many blows to the floor... but it does still work!"
2,Needs An On/Off Button,"When I received the timer, I read the instructions and put it use. Simple to use and counts up or down. The buttons are easy to use and the display is big and easy to read. When I was done, I proceeded to try and turn off the timer. I thought I was missing something. There is no on/off button so I have to take the battery out or the timer stays on constantly. I can't believe they would design a timer without a way to turn it off. I should have read the other reviews more carefully, others have complained of the same thing. I am very disappointed with my purchase and would not purchase again. Make sure the timer that you buy has an on/off button and save yourself batteries and hassle.I also wanted to mention that this timer only has a 99 minute timer which is not long enough if you plan on using it when cooking something like a roast, turkey or ham."
1,Maybe the worst designed product I've seen.,"You'd think that by 2009 they would have pretty much figured out how to make a simple kitchen timer. Sunbeam has amazed us all with this ill-conceived design. Some highlights:* In order to set the time for 30 seconds you have to hit the keys 0-0-3-0, not 3-0 like EVERY other timer out there. Why they decided to make such an unintuitive UI choice is beyond me.* The magnet on this timer is narrow and sticks out about 1/2 an inch from the back, turning the entire unit into a see-saw that sits on your fridge. When you push the start button, it sends the timer plummeting to the ground.It's almost worth buying just for the novelty of having such a poorly designed product!"
1,The Reset key always gets stuck,This is the second one I am buying and the reset key always gets stuck.
2,No 'off' button,"This timer is inexpensive and simple to use. However, there is no 'off' button, so the display is always on and therefore draining the batteries. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,Solid starting place for a novice,"I'm always looking for a good guide book for undergrads and biocomputing novices that covers the basics without getting carried away with algorithmic minutiae. I found this book a fair place to start for those who have no idea of what is out there. The tools and Web sites described are mainstays and likely won't be going anywhere. However, if you are already moderately knowledgeable, you will exhaust this book immediately. The nature of the field is constant movement toward newer and more thorough tools. This is not a users' guide: go to the referenced Web sites themselves to get the most up to date, accurate information.I would refer a naive beginner to get this book at the library, but I wouldn't put it on my own shelf."
4,Doctor recommended,"My pediatrician recommended I buy this online when my toddler ended up with a staph infection on his skin. After reading lots of other reviews, I thought it would just be useful to have for other things as well. So I went with the larger bottle. Arrived as promised and seems to do its job!"
4,Infections,"I just bought this product at my local Walgreens after my Esthetician told me to try it out. I used to get Brazilian waxes done every 3 or 4 weeks, and I started to get really nasty, infected ingrown hairs which would turn into large, tender, cyst-like bumps that resemble acne! I stopped getting waxes and the infections eventually subsided a little after using EVERY acne/anti-bacterial product ever made. I just got waxed again yesterday, and she told me to try this product because it works wonders. I have read all the reviews so far, so hopefully after using this product for a few days my infections will go away and STAY AWAY! I will come back and review this product again after about a week or so! I have high hopes for it so far!"
2,They need to make it fragrance free!,"I really need to use a product like this for an upcoming surgery but am very allergic to perfume and fragrance. The first inactive ingredient is ""fragrance"". So, it isn't going to work for me. What a shame."
3,Product leaked all over inside of box.,Product leaked all over inside of box. This is very disappointing. I find it hard to believe noone bothered to check and see if the bottles were sealed properly.
5,No more groin-area odor,"Been looking for something for a long time that would keep me from smelling even after a workout and day outside. No amount of soap could prevent an odor buildup later in the day. The active ingredient, Chlorhexidine gluconate, works by puncturing the membrane of the bacterias responsible for the odor. (I believe this ""puncturing"" action is why the product documentation recommends scrubbing for X amount of time.)Buy this and one of those Dial foaming soap dispensers, and use in the shower daily after soap. I let it sit for about a minute after scrubbing, this may not be necessary. No more odor, even the next morning. Be sure to rinse it all off, haven't had any skin irritations from it but some might.Says not for use in groin area, haven't had any problems; believe that warning is just for women."
5,Best buy on the net!!,"When my dermatologist insisted that I use HIBICLENSE and he wrote a prescription for it, I had no idea what was ahead! A 2oz bottle at the pharmacy cost me $65.00, that was with my insurance paying a percentage. When I saw this on AMAZON I jumped on it. Great deal and I will get more soon!! Thank-you"
4,Good Deal,For the price you get a movie and a game so not a bad deal at all. The game itself is fun but the movie makes it worthwhile.
3,Stranglehold is a Good First Person Game with a Movie Too.,"The game came fast from amazon and you just could not beat the deal they were offering. The one I got was the special edition whioh included the movie Hard Boiled...a good shoot em up type of movie featuring cops and bad guys with lots of guns. Plus, some of the features in this first person shooter game are incredible. Especially, the one with sharp shoot effects...kinda like matrix style used to kill enemies at a distance. The ability to slide on stairways and still have the ability to shoot is another cool ability. The only problem I had was when I went online to do the multiplayer version of the game...just did not have anybody on to play against. Most likely this is due to the game being out a while and only a few people can participate in a multiplayer match. The graphicas are amazing showing hd type of game. The movie just seemed in to be in a standard format. Enjoy."
2,I only bought it for Hard Boiled,"I bought this game because it is the only way to get Hard Boiled on bluray, well the movie is TERRIBLY dubbed and you can not choose to use subs, there is no scene selection or anything.The game itself is fun for the first hour then its to repetitive."
3,Just Fun!!,"I really just thought this game was a whole lot of fun. Yes the controls took a minute to figure out. But after the first few levels the game really takes off and is just a blast to play. I never did understand the story at all. For the price I highly recomend it. The movie which I have never seen before just like the game was very good, just alot of good old sensless violence."
3,stranglehold-hd?,This is a very good action shooter. There are lots of scenes with a ridiculous amount of stuff exploding and debris flying around. Very exciting.This title was a big reason I bought my PS3. Unfortunately the game is only broadcast at 720p. It had been advertised as 1080p. I am still not very impressed with older movies that are converted to high def. I did enjoy the movie though (I had never seen it before).
2,for super Chow Yun-Fat fans only!!,"PROS: chow yun-fat voice acting, Hong Kong and Chicago background, Hard Broiled movie included, shooting up the environment is fun.CONS: Using the analog stick to aim is so frustrating. no manual save. if you screw up, you have to restart from the checkpoint. this is so ridiculous. no map and it's very easy to get lost. the Hard Broiled movie is not in HD. the color quality is poor. it's better than VCD quality but not as good as DVD. It is so disappointing to watch a movie this quality in a blu-ray disc.I like Chow Yun-fat, but not enough to recommend this to anyone. the game play really gets me so frustrating.Get this only if you are super crazy about Chow."
3,Game is dissapointing and rarely fun.,I played Wet before i played Stranglehold and was told this was better. FALSE. True you can slow down time and slide on almost anything in the environment to perform acrobatic kills but the items you slide on or use to slow down time to do these acrobatic kills on are so small that you have to keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Even though you pretty much did the same thing in Wet somehow it was alot more fun in Wet than it is in Stranglehold. I stopped playing the game after the 4th chapter. Only time i put it in is to watch Hardboiled on my ps3. Which is the only reason i rated this game this high.
5,ELUCE LE STELLE,"HIS RENDITION OF ELUCE LE STELLE, AND CORE 'NGRATO, ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER HEARD, HIS VOICE WAS MAGNIFICENT. WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND HIS MATCH, IN MY WORDS, THIS IS HIS FINEST ALBUM, THIS ALBUM WAS RECORDED LIVE, AND HE WAS IN GREAT VOICE."
5,The Voice of a true lover,I fell in love with Sergio's voice when he sang 'Coren'grato'on the Ed Sullivan show. In him finally I had found a replacement for Mario Lanza whom I still miss terribly. The 'malafemmena' recording alone is worth the cost of obtaining this collectible CD.And I had the pleasure of hearing Sergio live at the Cocoanut Grove just three days after his release from the hospital where he'd been treated for exhaustion. Those of you who were in Los Angeles with me in those days will remember that John Gary stepped in and did a heroic job for three evenings. But it was Sergio's magnificent emotionally sustaining performance that night that established him as a true troubador of romantic lyrics.Though missed beyond words he still holds a treasured place in our hearts.
2,SERGIO,I was disappointed in the recording.........I have heard better. Sergio has an exceptional voice & this didn't produce his quality.
5,Being Black Funked,"I read Black Funk I in a day. The story was deep, although there were some profanity. You had to get pass all the cursing and the sex to understand the story. My Bookclub just finished reading Black Funk II , that answered most of the lingering questions. We were fortunate to have Michael at our meeting.Ladies, the man could be Rashun twin. He is tall, dark, handsome, intelligent and down to earth. I would reccommend that all black males and females read this book. You need to know if you are being blackfunked or are you having some ""ruffff sex."" The most excting part for me was when Andria and Rashun went through the cleansing. We have to let go of our past to live for our future."
4,NICE READ,"NICE READ, THIS BOOK WAS O.K. I THINK IT IS A MUST READ.THE BOOK IS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN LOVE BUT GOT HURTTHEY TRY TO LOVE AGAIN, THEY GO THREW THE UPS AND DOWNS BUT TRY TO COME TOGETHER THREW ALL THE DRAMA. I CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 2"
2,NOTHING THERE,the only thing good about this book is the fact that most of it takes place in brooklyn where im from. but it has a whole lot of [stuff] in the book that doesnt need 2 b there at all.he started off well in the first few pages and totally fell off. im in no mood 2 read part 2. i c no reason 2. the title catches u thats y u read it but if n e 1 was 2 go on the postives that others put up here 4 the book they r going 2 b gravely disappointed when they read it
3,WHOA????,"The title and the cover grabbed me. It's slow in the beginning I guess it's the introduction. OH MY BLACKFUNK???? The meaning is WHOA???? This book has you asking yourself is this for real? The typos are so perturbing, it's hard to get lost in a book where you're trying to figure out was this the word the author wanted to use! It's an interesting book, it has a sequel that gets a little hotter."
5,Great read,"Apart from the typos in the book i believe its a great book, very different from the other romance novels, i need to get part 2 and 3 i bought it when the author came down and was doing book signing i wasn't interested in the book but because i had asked him the price i did not want to just walk away so i bought and and he signed it for me and my sis. I read it the very first day and i could not lay the book down for more than 5 minutes i really love this book. Great job"
5,Erotic,It was very very very hot and highly exciting. After finishing the book my husband and I have been having sex daily using different positions and places. I think Mr. Preshley is a very gifted and knowledgeable author. Is he thinking of writing another book? I can't wait. I've recommended this book to a lot of my friends and co-workers. Good luck!!!!
1,Don't do it!!!,I purchased 3 of these MP-4 players and none of them work. They will not hold the FM stations or the pre-sets. They will not charge. They will not hold but 6 songs of standard length. They will not charge. The earbuds were broken when we got them. The company will not stand behind them. I basically paid them $300.00 for trash!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Surprising,"I tell ya what, i almost put this book down when i started it. But, i figured i should finish it out and see how it ended. See, it wasn't my type of book. But, as i finished it i was surprised by its storyline and ability to keep you guessing. Parker does a good job at stringing you along and then when you think you've got it, he turns it around and leaves you hanging. I ended up liking the book so much the moment i finished the book i order both books two and three. All in All it was a good, intriguing read."
4,very nice intreaguing book,"The book has a lot of unexpected turns and twists and is very pleasant to read. The author has the skill of the ""lost"" creators to tell a story while not revealing too much at a time. Not being able to predict everything is a very welcome change to this genre. No evil villain who has obtained some sort of artifact that must be destroyed!"
5,Great Message for all ages,"Keeping You Safe was a great piece of work. The songs carry a tune that any age would love and a strong message on how important it is to be safe when it comes to fire and water.It is a known fact, kids learn from music. This CD is not only fun for the children but a very good learning tool. Thanks again for working for our kids."
1,Be aware that this is a Mono recording,"I was not aware that this was a Mono recording when I ordered it but the sound quality was terrible the instant I started playing it , I gave it away. This is the second tme in the last few weeks that I have bought a Mono recording from Amazon, on neither occaision was this fact vouchsafed."
4,very good primary source material,"Although this book is admittedly not the most accessible one in it's class, it is one of the most useful if you have the time and desire to delve into the issues of sex and the law in depth. The book is comprised almost entirely of court decisions, and as such is an invaluable compendium of source material. If you're looking for a brief overview look elsewhere, but if you want a roundup of relevant court decisions this is an excellent reference."
5,Hawaiian Style,I received the product quickly. I love the music selection. Every time I yearn for Hawaii I just pop the cd in.
3,Hawaiian Style,"I was looking for Luau type music. These are mostly remakes of older songs by Local Hawaiian artists. Pleasant to listen to, not what I was expecting."
4,Good Value- Good Stand,No real complaints. A little heavier than I expected (45 lbs) but still very manageable. Did not experience any of the problems listed in some of the other posts. Would certainly purchase this again.
2,stablemate plus100,"I found this stand to be cumberson. Their was no stop on one of the arms it comes completly out of the socket, the other one has stops on it. The angle of the holder is not inline with the saw base."
4,Can't take a hit,"This is a nice light and portable miter saw stand. It breaks down quickly and adjustments are simple and quick. With the material stop I made quick work out of cutting 200 2x2 deck railing ballisters with decorative 45s on the ends. It also is sturdy enough for any materials I've loaded it with (haven't tried a 4x10 yet). Now for the bad news. The sliding arms have very little play in their sleeves, which is mostly good (they don't sag much when not clamped down). However if your saw takes a hit, which can happen, the party is over. The aluminum arms cannot tolerate any amount of bending and still slide in their sleeves, and they are not removeable for any kind of servicing. Thus the sliding, retractable support arms become non moving, non adjustable support arms, and the saw loses alot of its usefullness. Still, it's a high functioning, light weight, and very affordable stand, so go for it. Just watch for falling ladders."
4,StableMate PLUS100 Universal Miter Saw Stand.,"Considering it is relatively heavy duty, I received it with a broken u-bolt and a bent threaded shaft. The quick off saw feature is nice and the unit locks in position and folds. It looks a bit crude since nothing is finished, just bare metal but the functionality is there and for [that price]I guess you can't ask for more. I rated it 4 stary primarily because I had to call and wait for replacement parts."
5,Very sturdy.,Very heavy but solid as a rock. First one of these was stolen with the chop saw. Had to replace it and chose the same thing again and not disappointed.
4,Great Value,"I bought mine from a local retailer on sale for 20 bucks less than amazon. I have used it for over a year now and it has been very good overall.Other stands may have more features and be better in some respects but you'll have to shell out $200 or so. For the price this stand is hard to beat as it does nearly everything more expensive stands do. It is very heavy duty and sturdy and does not wobble even when used with a sliding compound miter saw. The best thing is that it can be set up and broken down very fast (30 seconds) making it a great workhorse stand for jobsites.On the downside, the roller end supports are adequate for most work but they lack in fine adjustment so that to get them perfectly level with your saw table can be rather frustrating if your going for a perfect cut on a long piece of wide molding. As with any extendable roller type miter saw stand, there just isn't enough support for long work pieces when doing fine finish work."
3,Does what its supposed to do,Had a little trouble from the beginning. Was missing one of the roller supports that go at the end right out of the box. Called the company and they answered right away. Found out they were just up the Mississippi from me a little ways. They get a new piece sent out and all was well. There's nothing fancy about this stand. Its just good and sturdy.
5,Miter Saw Stand,I am very happy with the Stablemate Plus 100 miter saw stand. I was concerned that the Bosch 5412 12inch saw might be too big and heavy for the stand but it works great. I have installed several hundred feet of baseboard using the stand and the extensions work great.
4,worth every penny,"I bought this stand to use with a Bosch 12"" compound slide miter saw and I was not disappoined one bit. After much shopping around, I decided to try this one based on the other reviews and the price. This stand, while it doesnt have as many features as the Dewalt or Bosch models, is great. The legs are solid, and the quick detach feature works just as well as the Dewalt one i have been around. For just an all around workhorse on a limited budget, it is worth every penny."
5,Devon,"I recently received the Stable Mate Plus and unfortunately a couple pieces were missing because the box split in shipping. I called the toll-free number inside the box and the parts arrived two days later...Bravo for customer service. I love this sturdy stand that does not rock back when I let go of my DeWalt Compound Miter. I am an avid woodworker with a complete shop. I ordered the wheel set along with the stand. Everyone should do this because moving this stand around is a cinch when the wheels are attached and they dont detract from its stability. This is one of the sturdiest stands I have experienced and would recommend it to anyone. If someone is going to use this from job site to job site, you may want to think twice. This is a solid piece of equipment and the picture does not do justice. It will withstand abuse."
3,StableMate Miter Saw Stand,Ended up sending it back. No wheels was too much of a hassle. Bought the Rigid Utility Mitre Saw Stand (Home Depot) instead. Home Depot sells the Rigid for $199 but sometimes it goes on sale for $149. What a great mitre saw stand! Wheel it around easy as pie and set up and take down are super easy. Costs twice as much as the Stablemate but it's worth the difference. Be prepared to drill four holes if you have a non-Rigid mitre saw like I did (I have a Makita).
4,"JVX 42"" LCD TV","This 42"" LCD HD TV seems to be a great product, although I really cant tell about the picture clearity right now as I dont have HD, just digital satalite. But is easy to operate, looks great and has a bright picture."
1,Bleh,"I thought that the first reviewer may have been overexaggerating, but this one really does taste bad. I believe the only way to come close to enjoying the cheese part of this is to store the box, in its entirety, in a humid environment so the cheese can, well, get soft. Other than that, it's horrible and you should simply discard it. The Slim Jim, on the other hand, is ""so-so"" but may taste better with a dip or something. This is not the same as the skinny Slim Jims (you know, the addictive ones) so if you don't want to ruin your taste buds with so-so beef and horrible cheese, move on."
1,SLIM JIM BEEF &CHEESE TWIN PACK,"THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT, THAT WE HAVE EVER GOTTEN, IT WAS OLD AND OUT DATED. I WOULD NOT EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
1,A bad idea,"An unusual and unsatisfying package. Half of the album is filled with Mitsou hits from her first two albums and the second one with hits from a Quebec band, Les B.B. Definitely an album you should pass."
5,Just one question to shipper that did its wifi work before...,"Dear Sir,I couldn't configure the wifi/access point.Its pleasure if you can help me out of this.Regards"
2,Tehilim,"I'm just not feeling it! The acting was good, it was realistic , but I just kept waiting to have the story all lead up to something, anything, it left me hanging. The end was really disappointing , it just did not tie loose ends together... so the mother gets the necessary paperwork to be able to support her children, so what? it was just plain disappointing. The movie lack ""life."" I certainly don't recommend this one. It's like someone forgot to add spices to the meal. BLAND. BLAND. Forget about it."
1,This book is lame,"It has less that 10 words per SMALL page. It is just a useless comic strip. I guess it may cheer you up if you boyfriend left you, but it offers no real help except for mabey 30 seconds of laughter while u are reading it."
2,Not the best one out there.,"You can find better info surfing around the web. One of the better books of this type is ""Plenty More Fish"". It's an ebook, but very good!"
5,Right on Target,well worth the plice for practice.Fairly durable and can not say anything bad about the workmanshipflys straight and long
4,"Milestones, a review of the first half of the life of the current pope","Milestones is a highly readable, name-dropping autobiography that illuminates some of the life and thinking of the current pope. Our church chose this for one of the selections of our book club. We reviewed it just after Benedict XVI's controversial talk at the University of Regensburg, which we read in its entirety. The consistency of the sentiment of that talk (advocating, basically, for a repudiation of violence in the practice of religion, and a dialogue with other religions and with science) with Benedict's early life is very clear. He is an actor on the world's stage, but also an important religious leader, whose vision directly affects nearly a billion people and indirectly the entire world. Important, easy-to-read and gentlemanly book."
2,An Overview of Ratzinger's Life -- Not His Thought,"Joseph Ratzinger is one of the most significant Catholic theologians of the modern era. However, from his memoirs one wouldn't fully understand why. He writes lightly about his life in pre-war Germany and harrowingly of what he and his family endured during the war itself. As he traces his development as a priest and theologian we only receive tantalizing hints as to how and why his theological thought developed as it did.It's a nice read, and a quick one, but one would do better to read the two volumes of interviews that Peter Seewald conducted with Ratzinger to get an understanding of his mind in a less formal setting than in his published theology."
1,Doesn't seem to hold,"I got this for shoes, which it didn't seem to hold, and to attach something to the windshield of my car, which fell off after a few weeks. I've yet to try it on anything else, but it hasn't worked for the two projects I purchased it for."
1,Don't buy unless you listen first.,My mom got me this CD for my birthday. It was a waste of money because I think it's horrible! She thought that it's good because someone in the store recommended it. In my eyes she wasted her money on this CD.
1,as a response to Lena1774@aol.com:,as a response to Lena1774@aol.com: Why do you think Amazon provides a range of stars? They welcome all the opinions - positive and negative. I have nothing good to say about this performer and his stuff that's why I give him only one star. Too bad that they don't have zero option.
2,This CD is so-so.,This is one of those CD's that you will listen to 2 or 3 times and then forget about it. He really does not have a very strong voice.
1,There are many things that are much better!,"Don't waste time, money, or even your eye site on this CD. ENRIQUE IGLESIAS IS NOT GOOD AND WILL NEVER MATCH THE OTHER GREAT SINGERS OUT THERE!!!"
2,VERY DISSAPOITING!,"I was very disapointed with this CD.its the oppisite Enrique and balimos,greatest hits are,good.His lyrics are Corny,no real meaning.VERY DISAPOINTING.I only recommed it to Diehard fans."
2,This is his best album,This is his best album. It's not the best example of the Latin Music anyway. At least in this album he started to understand that it's better not to force his voice into something impossible - singing.
3,Soap opera theme music,"I'm in the ""annoying voice"" camp. These songs all sound like the themes to bad Mexican soap operas -- which is exactly what ""Nunca Te Olvidaré"" is."
1,FORGET IT!,"NO PUEDO CREER QUE ALGUIEN PUEDA ESCUCHAR LA VOZ DE ENRIQUE IGLESIAS SIN QUE LE DUELA LA CABEZA. SUS LETRAS Y SU MUSICA ES ESPANTOSA, NO SE COMO PUDO LLEGAR A DONDE ESTA. POR FAVOR NO COMETAN UN ERROR Y COMPREN ESTE CD!"
5,Enrique es muy caliente,"Enrique Iglesias is the best thing in latin pop music...wait till his english cross-over album hits us!!! His first english single ""Bailamos"" is incredible...Ricky Martin watch out!!!"
3,He's on his way,"Although not the strongest latin singer out there, Enrique is showing improvement from his previous albums. Contrary to what others have said, Enrique does a fine performance in-person and can certainly bring a crowd to its feet. The songs all have a nice tune to them, but nothing with staying power. His good name and good looks got him into the business, but who knows if his music can keep him there for long"
3,"okay, not his best stuff","The production value of the CD is great, but the songs themselves lack melodies that are memorable. You forget the songs as soon as you have heard them."
4,Cosas de cosas del amor,"This is a very cool 3rd disc from our man Enrique. Most of the tracks he's written here are really good, although another guy who writes for him, Rafael Perez-Botija deserves a shout. I wasn't particularly fussed on either of the singles (Nunca te olvidare and Esperanza), but the rest of this CD is a good listen. I love the dark, sultry sound of Ruleta Rusa, and Para de jugar is a close second. They're both most uptempo than the overall tone of this CD, the good, half tempo ones are Cosas del amor and Contigo, both groove nicely. If you've got Enrique's English album, this is worth a listen too. I don't speak Spanish, but I still enjoyed this CD."
2,Rudness,"This goes to the rude and ignorant person named ""Jeca meca"". The people that you insulted simply stated their opinion. If their opinion is different from yours it does not give you right to call them ""idiots"". NOT EVERYBODY will like your idol, get used to this fact. Personally I agree with everything that those people said. Enrique is not the worst case in music world but he is not the best one either."
1,"Best advertised worthless ""artist""","No voice, no feeling, the letters uuuaa before every phrase of a song, he manages to sing worse than his father, a feat I thought no one could do. Do not believe the hype created by his record company+ Univision and his publicists. The lowest rating Amazon provides is 1 star. This cd and his previous ones must be rated 0 stars or F- at the infinite power."
4,Bien Disco/Good CD,"This is a good CD with romantic ballads that make you relax and are nice. Among the best are ""Cosas del Amor,"" ""Esperanza,"" and ""Ruleta Rusa."" His second CD is a little bit better, but this is a good third CD. His voice, which does not, does not, does not, does not, sound irritable, can carry on ballads with you listening and singing along. I even encourage non-Spanish speaking people to buy this.Esta es un buen disco con baladas romanticos que te hacen relajar. Los mejores son ""Cosas del Amor,"" ""Esperanza,"" y ""Ruleta Rusa."" Su segundo disco es un poco mejor, pero este disco esta bien. Su vos, que NO suena iritable, pueda cantar baladas con tu escuchando y cantando can el."
1,A DISGRACE TO LATIN MUSIC,"What is going on with the Latin community. I've listened to a couple of songs on this CD. Let's be realistic! This guy can't sing a lick. He's really popular with the ladies because they think he's cute but he sounds like Gulmer Pile from the TV show when he sings. I wouldn't have the CD even if it were free!! YUCK!!! Want to listen to a real singer? Listen to Ricky Martin, Luis Miguel, and definitely Julio Iglesias. Being a musician myself, I think Enrique is a disgrace to latin music."
1,"""charming performance""",This is a collection of what has been wrong with radio in the last couple years. It's a good laxative if you are constipated.
4,Very enjoyable!,"I bought this cd for one main reason, and that was so that I could listen to ""Esperanza."" It was worth it. This cd is full of romantic songs. I highly recommend it."
2,Tedious and Insipid,"I just listened to the entire CD, and every song sounded exactly like the last one. Enrique may be a cutie, but his music is simply uninspired and uninspiring. And that's a real shame, because he has a nice voice, but he really needs to find some better songwriters."
1,BAD AND PATHETIC,The dog was howling again. If somebody should really likes these kind of music he should choose an album of Chris Duran.
4,Sure to go up in price,"This set is impecably crafted and sure to go up in price!!! I was in Forbidden Planet yester day and I saw this priced at over $40, I purchased it for $30. Bome is a great sculptor and I got it, having not even seen the anime. I am not even a collector (anymore) but I kept this one in the packaging along with another of Bome's figures. I hope to get more soon."
4,Much respect,"After reading this bio, I have totally new respect for Pulver....this dude lived through some horrific times to make it to the top of his profession! Good read!"
2,Little Evil: One Ultimate Fighter's Rise to the Top,"After finishing within 2 days, I felt that it was very much more of a sob story than anything else. I am not trying to disrespect Jens. For those who want to read about Jen's past, this would fit the bill. It gives detailed account of his family life, school, financial situation etc. Perhaps for him, this was an especially emotional story hence certain people may not like this autobiography."
4,"The ""Emma"" stories are delightful, and far better than the ""Richard Jury"" series","Many people have complained about the pace and tone of this series, but if you start with the first (""Hotel Paradise"") and carry through, they are delightful and far better written than the Jury books (which always strike me as near-miss, since the basic idea often is fine but they are B-grade writing and plotting). I really love this series (including what people complain about as ""bratty"" or ""mean"" behavior by Emma, although I'm a little puzzled as to exactly what decade they are in, and how old her mother must be, for the various time intervals mentioned as history to work) and can't wait to read more. I particularly like the maybe-supernatural touches, and Emma's observations (and her development of coping skills, and even a conscience) about the world.I hope that Martha Grimes will focus on this series, and let us hear more from Emma!"
2,I must have fallen asleep,"The next thing I knew I was at the end of the book and looking for more pages. The story just ends, like falling off a cliff and not landing. I loved Hotel Paradise and Cold Flat Junction, so was excited to know Emma was again up to her adolescent tricks in Belle Ruin. I still think the characters are delightful and fun, but Martha, I want a story WITH an ending. Please!"
2,Southern Accents?,"I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents. Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents."
1,Drowning in Details,"""Details piled upon details, which I have been told is one of the problems about this story. It is drowning in details."" This quote sums up the book. The book had way to many details early on that by the time I read the first 40 pages I was bored. Although we are given many details about some of the characters in the novel they are flat and our 12 year old hardly seems like a 12 year in speech and actions.I found this book at a trading shelf in a Florida campground and picked it up thinking it might be somewhat interesting. Perhaps the book is better after the first 40 pages but this reader put it back on the trade shelf.I blog about book on my blog Amanda's Weekly Zen."
3,I really wanted to like this book,"I didn't know that I was supposed to have read the other two books in the trilogy before reading this one. While I didn't feel ""lost"" for having missed those, I just couldn't get into this one. I didn't take particularly well to Emma, who was remarkably self-absorbed -- but if we can't be self-absorbed at 12, when can we? -- conniving, and a heck of a liar to boot. I got past that, though, and page by page, tromped through the book so that I could find out the resolution to the 20-year-old mystery.Ha! Gotcha! There IS no resolution. I was disappointed that my 3-week trek culminated with a feeling of confusion and a week's worth of overdue fines at the library. Nevertheless, I could see that Ms. Grimes was trying to create a girl with great intelligence and a lively spark; I even chuckled out loud every now and again. All in all, I've read better, but I've also read much, much worse."
3,Do I like it or not?,"I've read all three books in this series, and I'm not sure whether I like them or not.I like Emma, her quaint little town, and her unending search to solve mysteries. The sheriff, Maud, and Dwayne are interesting characters, and very likeable ones, but one does have to wonder what kind of mother Emma has. Emma always seems to have money to hire cabs and buy what she wants, and yet she seems to have no supervision.This novel, for me, was downgraded for the silly Medea subplot. It didn't make any sense, and it wasn't interesting. I find that I'm tired of Will, Mill, and Re-Jane. I also got very tired of reading about doughnuts, and I like my mysteries to end with a resolution.Since this novel has a 2005 publication date, one has to wonder if it is the last in this series."
3,Okay Read,"This book is NOT up to par with all of Martha Grimes's other mysteries. It was mildly entertaining, but I wouldn't say it was overly enthralling."
1,Save your time and money,"A total disappointment. A lengthy repetition of the same characters' idiosyncracies that goes nowhere. Nothing of any interest happens, despite book jacket promises of revelations."
3,A haunting story,"I am a true fan of the irrepressible Emma Graham, and this book does not disappoint in that aspect. As always. Ms. Grimes' characters are realistically drawn and adorably eccentric. And Emma is still pure delight. In this book Emma is trying to investigate a twenty year old kidnapping case when a small baby was stolen from a hotel room while her parents were downstairs dancing at a ball. The hotel itself was a beautiful, big old structure that used to be a hot-spot for society, but now it is a burned out ruin that Emma keeps visiting. Through Emmas' eyes we see this earlier time depicted in all its magical splendour. I can't fault the characters or the wonderful descriptions, but the story goes really nowhere and there is no resolution to the mystery. That is why I can only give this book three stars, when Ms. Grimes usually gets more than that from me."
2,Who done it?,The characters and mystery were fascinating. I love Emma's interior questioning and her doggedness. Up to a point... and that's my point. What is the resolution? Who kidnapped the baby? Where is she? Where is Ben Queen? Aren't writers supposed to tie up the loose ends?
2,annoying,"Ad blurbs for this book should advise readers to read the first two ""Emma"" books before reading this one. I have read most of the Jury books, but I was not aware that there were any Emma books until I struggled with this third one. Thus I hardly knew what was going on half the time or what was being referred to in this book. And what was the outcome? It's very annoying to read an entire book in this genre only to be left hanging as to the resolution of the plot. Grimes is not on the level of ""Turn of the Screw""; she should give the reader the answers."
1,What a mess....,"What a mess. As one reviewer said ""The entire work has no beginning nor end. It is one long drawn-out middle."" It just wallows around- an incoherent word jumble. If there is a story line I really couldn't find it.Aside from the dreadful editing job (if anyone actually edited it), a 12 year old child could not possibly have written the narrative. All in all, the whole thing is just too affected, precious and twee for words. Besides the chronological errors, misspelled words, etc. Just plain bad. Of course, I find the Richard Jury books to be much the same.Save both your money and time. Don't bother."
5,WONDERFUL gravy!,"This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don't use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!"
5,Best white gravy !,Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
2,"Good Ideas, Bad Choices","The story starts well, and drags you in, you can't help but start to like the characters. Among other reasons, thats why I had such a hard time with this story. I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief. There are several parts of this book where as I was reading I simply had to say, huh?The overall romance and story is enjoyable enough. I simply wish the author could have changed a few minor plots, and perhaps removed or altered a few scenes to make the story more believable."
2,Not her best work,"I got this book because I've read some of her other/later works that I liked. However, this one really isn't worth reading. Get Finder's Keepers or Accidental Goddess, they are much better than this."
1,this book sucked,I read a lot of books this is one that made me ill i dont want to read 5 chapters of how she feels i didnt like this book so much that i wanted to burn it she should stick to romance books I have about 5000 sifi books not a typo! i didnt like this book so much that i gave it away i cant say enough bad things about this book i hope this helps someone to not read this book
2,Did it end?,"I enjoyed the Accidental Goddess and was doing really well with Gabriel's Ghost but got bogged down then there was so much sex. I know it's a Scifi romance and I don't mind sex but the plot would be chugging along them BAM off they'd go into each other's arms. After all the sweating and heavy breathing it took a while to get back to the plot which would then struggle along.The major problem was half solved. Then the last line in the book ""Only fools underestimate the power of love"" leads you to believe there is a sequel but there hasn't been one yet that I could find.I'm glad I got this as a Kindle and didn't pay full price for hardback or even paperback."
5,AMAZING!!,"My husband bought me this book for my birthday, and I hesitated reading it because it didn't look like a book I would typically pick out at the book store on my own. After the first couple pages I was a goner.. I COULD NOT put it down! I had to get the other books related to this one and those were pretty good reads too, but this one was by far the BEST! I want to know more about Chas and Sully!! I NEED to know more! Definitely recommend!"
3,Not a satisfying stand alone - be prepared to read book two,"I am re-reading this series, as I have yet to read the latest installment. It is a good series and I am looking forward the new installment....but it struck me again as I read this book that it really reads as a ""volumn one"" in a two part story. Without reading the next book in the series (shades of Dark) you will get very little closure to any storyline introduced in this book. Even the HEA is still up for grabs at the end of this book."
5,My favorite blank book,This one's my favorite. I've been journaling for years and this blank book has all of the features I'm looking for. The cover closes to protect the pages. There's a pocket in the back for photos and notes. The binding is stitched so it stay open easily. The paper is great. A great deal at twice the price.
4,Met expectations.,"The book met expectations, but at some points, especially the description of methodologies, some things are superficial. Good for area experts."
5,Great!,"Came in record time. case was busted, but I only paid $3 for the movie so didn't expect it in perfect condition. I would def buy from them again."
2,Buyer beware: great collection but edited songs :(,"I bought this CD because it contained a great collection of songs, many of which are hard to come by now from the original artists. But I was very dissapointed that several of the songs wound up on somebody's cutting board! Just to name 2 examples, ""Valley Girl"" and ""Dancing in Heaven (Orbital B-bop)"" both had their last verses removed. So buyer beware."
5,A Perfect Fit,"We purchased these for our physical therapy office. They work great and fit patient charts just perfectly. They are heavy duty and seem to be able to stand up to a lot of wear and tear! Great, heavy duty, sleek purchase!"
4,"Good mellow, atmospheric, slightly bizzare fun.","I wish more people (that is, anyone at all) liked Metrovavan as much as I do, because then I'd feel like I belong in the human race.This album is somewhat eclectic, fairly laid-back, and has sort of a french tone to it (probably the samples of people speaking in French). It sort of reminds me of White Town's (also quite off-the-wall) Women in Technology, though this is by far the stronger album. Tracks 3 and 5 are standouts in my mind - listen to the samples. If they don't work for you at all, then you will probably hate the album. But if you find them intriguing, and like Supreme Beings of Leisure or maybe Portishead (especially if you like them but tend to find the vocals a bit overbearing), you will probably love this album, almost as much as I do."
1,Not SURE If I was Watching the SamE Film as Everyone Else?,"Cause this film has received some stellar reviews that are completely unrealistic. The movie and performances were sub-par at best without no question. I gave this movie one star and thats out of generosity. You might as well watch the original film ""Single white Female"". It was more raw and realistic and had alot more sexuality too it. This movie was like a G version of that movie and a Imposter. And as Bad as Single White Female 2 was it was a Emmy winner compared to this. At least it wasn't posing to be another movie like this one is. I'm not sure why this was released in a movie theater? This is very much straight to video quality at best. No big names? No familiar faces? No original plot and No great acting? Billy Zane hasn't been a relevant actor sense The TITANIC. So the director obviously knew someone or pulled some strings for this one. Move on people theirs nothing here to see new or innovative."
2,LAME VERSION OF SWF WANNA BE!!!,"Everyone in the theater laughed at the most ""suspenseful"" parts of this movie. It is overly dramatic, poorly written, and not believable. By the end, I felt more sorry for the stalker than I did for the ""heroine."" The one positive of the movie is that the acting is pretty decent. Billy Zane gives a nice performance as a fashion professor. All in all, if you are going to see a PG-13 thriller (NOT HORROR) starring the chick from Gossip Girl, then you are probably just looking for a fun time. Sadly, this fails even on that level. Instead of this, rent ""Single White Female"" for a GOOD stalker mix of thriller/horror movie! C"
1,Garbage,"Anyone who thinks this movie was good, had a good story/plot, had good acting, etc., are as stupid as the good roommate (and her idiotic friends). I rented this with a free promo from redbox, so at least I only wasted a bit of my time watching it. Utterly pathetic."
1,Really?,"Any movie that needlessly kills an animal, regardless of being in the horror genre, is disgusting. No good ever really comes for the cute, fuzzy little animal, but they dont need to show it. Absolutely love horror movies, any kind, good and bad. But i do draw a line for animal cruelty. Putting a kitten in the dryer? Really, I'm actually shocked that they actually showed it. I mean the movie itself is awful. I have never seen Leighton Meester act this poorly, Queen B is a much better character."
3,Good But Not That Great,"I was hoping that the movie will be as good as I thought of the movie trailer. However, it turned out okay. Minka Kelly was definitely an angel as it is in the ABC TV series ""Charlie's Angels. She and Leighton Meester, I swear, kind of look like each other."
3,"Not the best, but still enjoyable.",I didn't think that this thriller was as bad as some say. It's entertaining and Leighton Meester plays a great bad girl.. however the other girl is blah. Recommended for a rainy day watch.
3,"It's not the best movie, but it's Cool!","Don't expect the best movie of your life, because it's not! But it's a cool one that you can watch! It's not boring! Give it a chance! :)"
3,COLLEGE DAZE,"THE ROOMMATE is basically a revamped version of SINGLE WHITE FEMALE for the teen set. Minka Kelly (the new CHARLIE's ANGELS) is pure Sarah whose new roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester--GOSSIP GIRL) takes obssessive psychosis to new heights.Under pedestrian direction by Christian Christiansen, the movie is a by-the-book piece that offers nothing original and not much suspense. There's also little shown to explain Rebecca's mental condition. We see her pick up a lesbian and throw gasoline on some guy we've never met.Kelly and Meester try gamely to involve us and Billy Zane is a hoot as the lecherous fashion instructor.In spite of its predictability, THE ROOMMATE is moderately entertaining and doesn't pull some twist ending to inspire a sequel. It's just nothing special."
3,standard stalker thriller,"Nothing supernatural here, just a creepy college roommate who is obsessively interested in the unfortunate young woman sharing her dorm. Nothing lesbian, just psychosis.Cast members do what they can with the limited but competent script."
2,Poor Poor movie,"Its what looks to be a very poor attempt of recreating the movie ""single white female"". This movie keeps you hanging on the whole movie then finally something happens the last 15 minutes. Save your money and rent it if you want. Go and rent or buy ""single white female"", its a much better suspense thriller with more chills and action."
1,do not buy,"When I first saw the previews of this movie I thought this film was going to be great. When I finally saw it i was very disappointed. The acting is terrible, scenes are very predictable. Overall just terrible film. Its like they try to remake single white female except it takes place in college."
2,Another Single White Female Storyline,"This movie did not impress me at all, if you ask me, I would tell you that Single White Female was better in that it had key stars in it, this movie was alright, so what is going on with this girl? There is no real premiss for her being strange. I am trying to get into the movie, but it doesn't take me there, it drags, it's so similar to the Single White Female in that there is the issue with the cat, (SWF had a puppy), fixated on the room mate (same in this movie, with wearing the other girls clothes), being jealous of the boyfriend, well I think you get the picture, if you want to see the movie, you are better off renting it, or viewing it from your IPAD or computer, I am glad that I didn't waste money buying this when it first came out."
2,Damaged DVD Case,"It's what I asked for and ordered and still need to watch the DVD to make sure that works, but there was a puncture hole in the DVD case ... Box didn't seem to be damaged though."
2,"Has too many issues that destroy it, to make it a good film to watch","This movie has a good plot, but the conclusion of it is horrible and reveals its protagonist and antagonist to be total douchebags (this makes the plot look bad). What's also bad is its camerawork and very little chilling and/or scary moments. 2.5/10"
5,If you think something is missing from popular economic theory...,"Though the book doesn't explicitly refer to the connection between war and capitalism, it does criticize the core teaching of capitalism, which is the exclusive pursuit of money, that overlooks equality and fairness to others and ecological sustainability. The essays are acdemic and technical but most are readable and several are excellent in illuminating problems and suggesting alternatives. I would certainly recommend this to all economic students as well as to others who are concerned about economic issues, sustainability and world peace."
4,Churchill and America Review,"I am an avid reader of history. Martin Gilbert is an excellent writer who is the preeminent Churchill historian. As with all Gilbert books on Churchill, he adds new details to an extraordinary life for us normal folk. Churchill loved America and was anxious to see the US enter WWII for obvious reasons. Gilbert goes far beyond that period in this excellent history of Churchill. I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and enjoys the history of Churchill."
3,Gilbert's Notes,"Not a book for the person seeking to investigate the sweep of Winston Churchill's grand and worthy life. Instead, it is a plodding factual history of almost every aspect of his interaction with the United States. Sir Martin does not provide much in the way of interpretation nor does he very often cite the views of others towards Mr. Churchill's pro-American policies; almost all is mined directly from the written articles, letters, cables, or speeches of Winston Churchill.If he ever mentioned America, it is likely in this book. I can not imagine people from other countries enjoying this particular effort. And, I think a great many here will find this book, with its repetitious statements of the vital need for a close relationship between the two countries, deadening after a full reading."
3,Churchill and America,The actual content was very interesting; but there were some problems with the CD's; there were two substantial bad sections.
2,Not Very Good....,They do not taste all that great and are hard to chew. You pretty much have to swallow the outside jacket after several attempts to chew it into smaller chunks. Sounds nasty but I'm just sayin.....
5,Fascinating!,Good reading! An excellent true story! Good technical drawings and information. Hope to see more from this author.
4,Innovative Concept,"Orbital propulsion sounds like it would solve the world's energy problem, and revolutionize all forms of transport...why isn't it being implemented? George Knap presents an excellent case of conspiracy on a ""mega"" level."
5,no breakage here,"I'm on my 5th bottle of the cinnamon scent and it rocks. Smells terrific and really, really works better than the nasty artificial air fresheners. I even took a bottle to use in the ladies room at work where it keeps falling onto a ceramic tile floor because it's perched on a narrow ledge..........still works fine and seems to last a long time considering the small bottle.I highly reccomend this product and I am fussy!"
3,so-so,not as good as i might of thoght but a couple of tunes are good especially the opener but does'nt go much further than that
2,Can't stand the laugh track!,The laugh track is more than I can stand. Totally obnoxious.It would be o-k if the dvd contained an option to shut the laugh track off.
2,Really Disappointing,"A few minutes ago, I finished watching an Episode of this Season 1 or Season 2 Series on TV...it was VERY LAME and very SIMPLEMINDED. I can't see why anyone would PAY to OWN these Series. To each their own; but I saw nothing AT ALL Exceptional about this Series. It's bearable but SO UNSPECIAL!Personally, I'm not wasting my money on it...AND...it makes me think Very twice about going by Amazon Ratings."
4,Old Christine is my new favorite,"The New Adventures of Old Christine has been a weekly favorite of mine since it began. I've never purchased an entire tv series' DVDs before but Christine's a keeper & I plan to collect each season. In season 1, you're introduced to each of the characters, a huge handful of hilarious flaws Christine lives with on a daily basis, and you'll probably find something in each episode that makes you realize you might be a little more like Old Christine than you'd like to admit... I enjoy the performances of every single cast member of this show, immensely - from Julia's (old Christine) amazing talent for scripted and physical comedy, to Hamish's (Matthew) low-key wit that is the perfect compliment to Christine's frenzied insanity. The only thing better than this first season is the fact that with each additional season the entire show just gets better and better."
2,"Bad Show, Good Service","I was terribly disappointed by this show. I love Julia Louis-Dreyfus and I love her in Veep, but this was a sad disappointment. She is Elaine and the Veep in suburbia. Not funny. Not even with a laugh track. Sadly.But the dvd quality is good and the delivery was, predictably, very good."
4,great buy,The book was exactly as explained. Great price and value. I look forward to doing business with you again. Thanks!
1,NEVER NEVER BUY,NEVER BUY THIS CRAPPY BRAND I HAD THE REAR RIGHT BLOW OUT WITH ONLY 11000 MILES....IF YOU WANT HIGH QUALITY GO PIRELLI OR BRIDGESTONE.......
2,What you see is wrong..,The watering can that you see on the website of Amazon is not the watering you'll get. The watering can on the website is green. The can that you'll get is bright zinc coated so has a chrome colored exterior.I do not understand why all sellers of this watering can try to trick people.
4,Sonny Landreth - More Great Slide Guitar,"Landreth takes another 3 year break between albums finally releasing ""Road"" in 2003. This is another solid release from Landreth featuring plenty of smoking slide guitar and Cajun blues. The album frequently steps into more straight ahead rock territory as well which is yet another style that Landreth seems completely comfortable with. Personally I don't think this album is quite as good as either ""Outward Bound"" or ""South Of I-10"", but it is an improvement over the mixed results of his last disc ""Levee Town"". Highlights on this one include ""True Blue"" that almost sounds like Foghat to my ears. ""Gone Pecan"" is a cool little rave up with an irresistible chorus and lightning fast guitar. ""Natural World"" is Sonny's message song about the changing nature of the environment around us. ""Gemini Blues"", features more great guitar work from Sonny. Overall this is another album that should please the Landreth faithful and fans of slide guitar Cajun blues in general."
5,Slide Guitar & Blues - a tasty mix,"I think that this CD is incredible. The lyrics and the slide, along with the National Steel make this a CD that everyone who likes the blues should have in their collection. My favorite cuts are ""Hell at Home"" (reminds me of what it's like to be young, in love, and confused) and ""Juke Box Mama"" (sounds like a ""live"" recording where the guitar amp is bleeding into the vocal mic.) Just beautiful."
3,"OK, but doesn't rock","Picked this CD as first Landreth purchase based on reviews and a few cuts, for example the tribute to Hound Dog Taylor CD. I don't doubt that Sonny can play excellent slide, but it doesn't really come out on this CD. More polished and formula oriented than I expected. Maybe I'll try one of his earlier recordings..."
3,better as the sidekick,"Elvis and Ricky had James Burton; for a little while, Roger McGuinn had Clarence White; Tom Petty has Mike Campbell; and so forth. Sonny is a master guitar player who shines best behind someone else's songs and someone else's voice. Dylan once said that we had enough songs, we just need more singers to sing 'em.I'd rather hear Sonny interpret existing great material than deliver less than great originals. Nevertheless, he's still well worth a listen."
5,Awesome slide guitar!,"This is a great CD. I do not understand why Sonny Landreth does not generate more buzz. This CD has the most unbelievable slide work, great lyrics, and an all around great vibe. I saw him live twice in July 2003, and they were probably the best shows I've seen in years. Sonny Landreth's slide technique is something to see and hear---there is nothing else out there like it. Don't waste time. Buy this CD right now with ""1-click."" Also check out ""Levee Town"" and ""South of I-10!"""
5,Riding High on The Road,"From Hell at Home to Gone Pecan, Sonny's hellacious slide guitar work and blues inspired songs on The Road We're On take me to roots-rock heaven. If you're already a huge fan like I am, you'll love this record - great songs, great vocals and a guitar solo in every track! Like Levee Town, this recording has quickly become one of my favorites."
5,Superb Guitarist,"Fabio Zanon's CD is a great recording to have a anyone's current CD collection. He is a fine example of a current generation classical guitarist. This music encompasses musical styles ranging from the Baroque to the twentieth century. His performance of Bach is extremely clean, and equally important is Zanon's fluent treatment of the melodies in Tarrega's music. One could ponder while listening if he was not native to any of the styles contained on this disc. After obtaining this recording, the listener will want to see this performer live to appreciate the talent even more!"
4,"Great book, more for pre-baby","This is a great, easy-to-read book with good info. However, the title is a bit misleading--2/3 of the book deal with planning for baby and dealing with the first few days. It is an excellent book, but it is more a book to read in your last trimester than after baby is born."
2,Disappointed,"This book is most definitely NOT the Mother of All Baby books. Info is hard to find at times, focus is on basic baby care, and the health section, while informative, is so poorly arranged as to make it impossible to find the info you need. There is good stuff buried here, but it's not information you couldn't find in better, more well-rounded books."
3,Hard to put together,"This took like 3 hours to put together! I was going to give up after I got a HUGE cut! Once it was finished it was great, but there are like 40 pieces. The hardest part is putting in the floors. It sucked."
5,I want to buy it when i get my little hamster,It sound like a great cage from what I've read. I'm not saying you have to buy it or it's the best cage in the world it's just the best I've seen so far.So if you see a cage that has all the stuff that you need in there go ahead and buy it. Well thats all I have to say hope I helped!
5,GraveDigga,Awesome figure well made well painted and just plain cool.. Be sure to buy this figure and bloodaxe spawn you cant go wrong.
5,How can a film so closely resemble your life or dreams?,"I watch films more than most people I know( and I live in Hollywood), and maybe it was just the point in my life in which i could relate to the film, but this movie is AMAZING!. After watching it on accident about 2 years ago, I have since watched it about 15 times. Each charactor plays such a perfect roll to exemplify the entropy we feel in all our lives, and the way people try to interfear with our own paths. Whether you are a romantic, or a jaded heart-broken movie watcher, you will find true relation to this amazing story."
3,hit or miss,"i did find myself strangely drawn to this movie...but I do believe that it was mostly because of the cinematography. It portrayed the relationship of the character Jake(stephen dorff) and his girlfriend in a way that everyone can relate to and think ""awww"" without it being so ""corny"". The movie took a turn for the worse when the talking cat came, it sort of makes you wonder if you are watching the same movie. After that part it dragged on to the end and U2 sure did not make the movie any better. I think they actually made it worse. The film had a really good start though and I would pay the used price for it...but just turn it off before the cat comes...haaa"
2,All flash no substance,"I'm sorry to disagree with everyone but i didn't like this movie at all...the storyline was so abysmally boring and predictable that it was a real disappointment. I had seen, i'm sure like most others who found this movie, as a preview before a rented movie and the only reason i got it was because of the talking cat , which i thought looked hilarious, and also the fact that U2 was in it seemed to give it some credibility, even though i knew in the back of my head that Stephen Dorff isn't the greatest actor. Phil Joanou (director of the film...i think that's how you spell it) should stick to music videos because he defintely has a knack for cool shots, and visuals (the reason i gave this two stars), but unfortunately forgot that no matter how much style and flash you put on, its a good story that sells a movie, not visual effects. I wouldn't waste your time, unless you are a diehard U2 fan..otherwise there are much better movies to be seen.."
2,Performers better than the material.,Gwen Verdon and Richard Kiley give fine performances here but the material is decidedly second-rate.Though the show won the 1959 Tony award it has never been revived and will probably NEVER see a full-scale revival.The disc is for musical theatre completists only.
4,"""good but not in the same class as Chicago ~ Fosse""","Brother ~ Sister team Herbert and Dorothy Fields, Sidney Sheldon and David Shaw furnished the book/story ~ music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields came up with a musical theater rare original ""Redhead"", featuring Gwen Verdon (Mrs. Bob Fosse) and Richard Kiley. But it was the genius of Bob Fosse (choreographed and directed) that gave this vehicle a sparkle of vibrant life. This re-release with the complete twenty-one tracks has some highlights ~ ""I'M BACK IN CIRCULATION"", with Richard Kiley is wonderful ~ and ""ERBIE FITCH'S TWITCH"", is really a treat that only Gwen Verdon can decipher if you're into tonque-twisting refrains and chorus. Although this is not of the same caliber of ""Chicago"", that has taken the Musical World by storm, this is still good entertainment.Total Time: 50:35 on 21 Tracks ~ Varese Records 302-0621-732-2 ~ (4/01/2003"
1,Huh!?,There were a couple of things about this book that I found disturbing. The first is that the material is an odd concoction of things tossed together with some Wicca sauce poured over it and then served as a gourmet treat (which it is not). The second thing that is disturbing is that some people gave it a high mark review. It's very disheartening to see that for some people the material presented in this book is actually what they regard as Wicca. Here we see the further decline and demise of what was once a very beautiful religion.
2,"some practical information, but aggro towards other religions","Okay, this book has some good reference tables, and overview, but I'm really not happy with the author's sarcasm and hatred of other religions. It's subtle throughout, which actually conflicts with her opening statement about not judging other religions, and ""wiping the slate"" to go forward with an open mind and general acceptance of all other ways of interpreting religion. I thought that was really cool when I read it! Then I got to the glossary, where she says some aweful things about people in the Bible Belt, suggesting that they are less of humans than the rest of us. That was hard to read, because I know some very loving, caring people there who are relatives, that I respect and admire. I wish she would have proof read her work to remove all the negativity. It's repulsive."
5,Let me add to the praise.,"People who know me from The Ranting Witches know that I love this book. It is one of the first beginner-level books that really expects you to gain in knowledge as you go along. This is a post-modern big blue, a great journey into the craft."
1,Seriously flawed,"Quick review: If Neil Simon would have patterned this as a witty captivating play, it probably could have worked, but it's a movie pretending to be a witty play, and it doesn't work at pretty much any level. It doesn't help that the leads are so unlikable, especially Timothy Hutton's character where I literally shouted at the screen for him to shut the F up you F retard. The only reason Meg Ryan's character is hanging on to Tim's character is because they are both in the same sorry A league. Nuf said. Boring, tedious, and non climatic. Even the usual campy thieves, were without character, wit, or funny lines."
1,"Not even close to the condition of ""used but like new""","The DVD arrived serval weeks after the booking date, but still within the estimated date.It said it was ""used, like new"" but it was completely damaged. The cover was broken many places and the disc was in very bad condition, all scratched up."
4,Entertaining - Good to see Ryan and Hutton perform together,"I've enjoyed Timothy Hutton's acting for decades and I've also come to really enjoy Meg Ryan's work. How Louise handles things is definitely bizarre, but it is funny and Meg Ryan has some great lines as soon as she takes control of what's turning her world upside down. I thought the partying scene that went on with the uninvited was a bit overkill; it didn't add much to the movie and got a bit taxing. But, considering the outcome of the story - all in all, I liked this film and I'd watch it again."
4,"Killer Ending, Meg Ryan Carries It Off","I had real reservations about this DVD based on the write-up, but Meg Ryan carried it over as I was picking out three DVDs to keep me company on an editing marathon.BE PATIENT with the beginning. Despite Meg Ryan (doing very well playing a stressed out robot lawyer), I almost lost patience and moved on.On balance the movie is fun, provokes thought, and it has an absolutely killer ending that makes the whole thing totally worth watching from beginning to end, and leaves me chuckling with appreciation for Meg Ryan the actress and Meg Ryan the character as played in the film.Other DVDs that might be enjoyed:Non-MuscialsThe American PresidentMeet Joe BlackHow to Lose a Guy in 10 DaysSomething's Gotta GiveMaid in ManhattanSpanglishMusicalsBeyond the Sea : Widescreen EditionBride and PrejudiceDe-Lovely: The Cole Porter StoryWalk the Line"
4,I'm all tied up over this movie,"Sometimes, we all wish we could tie our significant other up and just make them listen. InSerious Moonlight (Widescreen), Meg Ryan acts on that instinct. The result is a pretty good balance of funny and emotional. I wouldn't say this is the funniest movie I've ever seen - not by a long shot - but it is probably one of the funnier romantic comedies. In a genre otherwise filled with dry and cliched films,Serious Moonlightis original and takes surprising turns. Certainly worth checking out if you like romantic comedies."
1,trash,This was a movie done before Meg Ryan had her lips swelled up like a blow fish . The movie is a peice of trash written and produced by demented Hollywood people .
3,Funny/Crazy,This movie was FUNNY in a CRAZY way!! Great for date night or just a girl's night!! Tons of Laughs and OMGoodness moments!
2,Slow moving and boring story. Very predictable outcome.,"Had no opinion of the characters other than ""annoying"". Since eleven more words are necessary to complete this review----it was a waste my time."
5,Great movie,This movie is super! Great message and fun to watch. The acting is superb and we are so happy that we have added it to our dvd collection...It would be a great addition for anyone!
1,Just awful,"Uneven tone, few laughs, and embarassing dialogue. Felt bad for Hutton. A closing scene is supposed to be thought provoking and maybe even shed light on the absurd previous 100 minutes. It made us laugh and shake our heads."
1,Do not waste your money; visit the site instead,"I would love to give this ZERO stars if I could!I had bought this cd in the hopes that I might find some grants that I could not find anywhere else. Instead, this cd had an Adobe document with a list of the 16,000+ grants, loans etc. The contents of the cd itself on took up perhaps 1/10(if that much!) of the actual cd.On top of that, the contents of the document were those of a website I had visited days before! ..."
4,Letters to My Birthmother,"I read this book because I am a birthmother. The author seemed honest in expressing her feelings, especially her feelings of anger. This may be hard for some people to read; however, she should be commended for her honesty. It is good for adoptees (and birthmothers, too) to write from the heart. To write only what is politically correct is harmful to the self. I would like to hear how this adoptee has resolved her anger and her feelings of loss."
3,Opens a window --- slightly,"This is a short, quick read in very plebeian, but clear language, concerning the journey of one adoptee in search of her birth mother.The book is not terribly engaging, and from the broader point of view, even within the adoption community, not very educational. It offers a narrow perspective, of one person, in one set of circumstances, that cannot automatically be generalized by others.Amy Dean's story is interesting, for itself. It's not, however, an archetype, and will not provide emotional support or ""search tools"" to other people within the adoption triad--adult adoptees, adoptive parents, or birth parents--in other circumstances.Read it, but keep in mind. Every adoption has its own set of stories, and this book opens a window on the complexities of adoption. But it's only one case, and others should not assume their adoptions, lives, or searches for birth parents/children will resolve in the same unsatisfying way as Dean's."
1,Too complicated,"This book is too complicated. The author tries to make distinctions between lies by omission, blatant lies, fantasy, etc. The explanations get confusing. I would NOT recommend."
2,States again what was said in the original...,"Buy ""They Call Me Assassin"" rather than spend your money on this release. It is simply too dry a read; especially when compared to his first book."
1,Tatum needs to stop capilalizing on Stingley's misfortune !!!,I wish I could give Tatum a -----***** in honor of Stingley's death today. What a self-centered jerk!!!
2,Not bad for price,"These sheets are not really gold, more of a light brown. They are not heavy sheets. They are soft and a little satiny. I would have expexted the sheets to be a little heavier for the thread count. I have 300 count sheets that are thicker and I was not happy with the color."
5,Co Q 10,"I have reviewed this product in the past (couple years ago). I use this for my son who has a metabolic disorder. We have had great results. He now has enough energy to stay focused and do well in school. We know it makes a difference in his engergy level as I ran out once and it took a couple weeks to get more (due to a supplier issue). We saw a definite change as did his teacher. Now I am more careful about my supply.We put it in his milk in the morning. It has an orange flavor, but when we put it in juice after a while, he will complain of his stomach hurting. May be too acidic to have that way on a daily basis? So he likes it best in his chocolate milk or in his cereal."
5,Great performances by a great volinist.,"Although Jascha Heifetz was the most acclaimed violinist of the 20th century, Michael Rabin was fully his equal technically but far superior artistically. In fact, Rabin was equal to, or better than, every violinist of whom we have recordings. Unfortunately, Rabin died in his mid thirties and left relatively few recordings, but his recording of the Paganini Caprices is still regarded as a standard against which all other performances of these works are compared. If you've never heard this outstanding violinist this CD will show you why decades after his premature death Michael Rabin is still regarded as a legendary violinist."
2,The Setting of the Pearl,The author uses a lot of words to describe something that could be said in much fewer words. He has a very difficult reading style.
2,Not as advertised,"This mask does not appear to be ""N anything"". Amazon's product description states:""99% filter efficiency against ragweed pollen""""filters out 99% of wearer's exhaled airborne bacteria""One might think this mask meets the NIOSH ""N99"" requirements. It apparently doesn't even come close. The box shown in the Amazon description does not match what was actually shipped in November 2011. The front of my box states, ""Filters out > 95% of wearer's exhaled airborne bacteria"" and ""Helps reduce exposure to household dust, ragweed pollen and yard dusts"". There is no NIOSH ""N"" designation anywhere on the packaging, and the masks' performance criteria certainly appear to be below that advertised."
4,Awesome !,"I am a diehard G-fan and I owned the previous game and just about ten different Godzilla movies. I waited a whole year watching trailers for this game. And......... It was worth it! I play at least an hour every day smashing enemies. Being a fun game and a great. However there are some issues. I would have liked to see a few more arenas. And when the game was still in development the produces listed several features, gameplay modes and monsters that were to be in the game and whoa and behold no trace of them. That's all."
4,Works with Xbox 360!,This is a great family game to play 4 player versus mode...especially for young ones who are firstlearning to play video games as they can just hit buttons. Works great with the Xbox 360!
4,Jet Jaguar! Friend to all children (& adults),"I got this game, rather than the previous version, because you get Jet Jaguar here. He's the coolest one. Someone reviewed him as being a stupid monster in this game with a pointless ability to change his size. Actually the size shifting is functional in battle. I just wish Giant Robot or Ultraman were included as well. Anyways, this is a good, fun Xbox game. Your can fight a 4-way melee with the monsters of your choice (go online and get the master-unlock-everything cheat), set difficult on ""hard"" and watch those things go off on each other, throwing buildings and ships and whatnot. I really like and recommend ""Godzilla save the Earth"". It's just semi-mindless, action-packed fun."
5,*WOW*,"This book is XXX hot! It was an exciting read. I love Raeder, he is so powerful, demanding and sexual! If you love just one sex scene after another you'll love this book!"
3,Not crazy about it.,"This toaster does not toast evenly, the center is dark and the edges are lighter. Would not recommend."
1,Very Disappointing,"Just a few points:-The plates are NOT non-stick.-They are also difficult to clean.-The green light that lets you know when the waffles are ready, is notoriously incorrect.Every time I've made waffles, they come out worse than the time before. So, I am tossing mine and looking for a maker that has removable plates. You get what you pay for after all."
3,Crooked!,"Really nice coat rack for the price. Very heavy. BUT .... the top pole was crooked when screwed in, about an inch off. So heavy for me to pack up and take to post office, I may keep it. But it looks off, I'll just try to stick a bunch of coats on it."
1,"Defective, poor design","As far as I can tell, this product is defective. The coat hanger arms are not contoured in such a way that they can be attached securely to the stem of the coat wrack. They will rotate left or right, or wobble back and forth. The screws that attach them are not secure, which results in stripping the screw threads by attempting to tighten them. I spent three hours trying to assemble it.I would not buy this product again, or recommend it to anyone."
1,cheaply made,If I could give you a minus star I would. Trying to put together and looks better in the photo than in person
3,Just okay,"This is okay, not as strong as one would like, little difficult to put together. Not exactly what I expected but only one i could find."
4,Good Product,"This was just the right size to go in my back hallway that leads to the back door. Just a note: If you don't balance your coats, it will tip over at the drop of a hat. It was easy to put together, however, one of the bolts was missing and I had to go to the hardware store and get one. Other than that, it is very pretty and goes with my hall table and mirror."
1,I can't recommend this C.D.,"Besides ignoring Tchaikovsky's own dynamics and tempi, this c.d. is taken from a terrible analog recording from 1978. There are parts that get skipped over probably due to recording glitches but there was absolutely no care taken to smooth the transitions out. This is a poor recording whose flaws could have been overlooked if the performance wasn't so sloppy."
3,No offense,"No offense, but I'm a big fan of Kylie's up-tempo songs. I appreciate that she has talent for big dance hits and slow, meaningful, heartful songs. I like Ocean Blue, but I listen to it rarely. If you're interested in the song, especially without paying the price of the single and shipping, try Kylie's official site. I downloaded it there, and its an acoustic, quiet song. Its really for the die-hard Kylie fans."
4,"Good polkas, waltzes, and variety","This CD includes twelve well-performed and well-recorded polkas, polka-style waltzes, and other dance numbers. The performances are lively, and varied enough so you won't mind the lack of lyrics on most of the tracks. The material is old, but it still sounds good. On a re-release, normally one expects a reduced price or an increased number of tracks. This CD features neither, so the four stars (as opposed to five) are for value, not quality. A decent package."
5,Excellent book!,This is an excellent book! I would highly recommend for anyone interested in forensics and death investigation. I could barely put the book down. I have years of experience in the field of forensic and autopsies and this book is an accurate depiction of our work.
5,Still Beautiful & Uplifting,"I'm 21 yrs old now, and it's been many years since I received my copy of this book. I wrote a poem that was selected and included: ""You."" I remember thinking that this small volume was a)nice to look at, b)a great way for young minds to venture into writing, and c)a way for others to understand the minds behind the poems. The book is separated into categories so that you can find something for whatever mood (i.e. love, God, family). After all of these years, I still find myself flipping through the pages and smiling at how wonderfully, each teen presented his/her own circle of experience. A beautiful choice if you want to share the love of poetry with a teen that is just discovering the wonder of poetry--rhyming or not."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I thought that there would only be a few minor scratches due to being used but when I opened it there was so much ware all over the SP, even the charger was squeaky and scratched. I bought it to play games on not for looks, all and all I'm content with it"
5,GBA SP Graphite rocks!!!,The unit is built really well. The color is outstanding! The improved screen is soooo much better lit. And it plays my old games in style. It's a wonderful device from Nintendo...
1,BAD,"Do not buy this item.It does not charge, I tried everything and nothing worked so this item would be a bad buy"
2,Not so great,"I think this system stinks. It was good in 2003, but now that it's 2006, it's time to move on with a PSP or DS. The backlight was a nice feature, but almost every handheld has that now. Mine is just sitting in my closet, picking up dust. The graphics and sound are mediocre. Eh."
5,"Corbin Cabin, fantastic DVD","This is a well oriented DVD for all age groups. It has pazazz for the paranormal world. These are the kind of groups we need to see on TV because this DVD kept me interested, to where some other Paranormal DVD's are boring. I thought well for the price which is reasonable if it is no good then no harm was done and I just put it on the shelf with the rest of the boring paranormal DVD's and forget about it, but I have watched it 3 times already and plan to watch it again. It gives the true history of Corbin Cabin and plus has some bloopers in it also which was true Videography. Frank, Jonathan, Michelle, and Mike keep this interesting and real and I hope I will see more from this group. This is the kind of group I hope to join. Great job Adventure Myth's keep it up and keep it coming I want more."
3,police car,Right at first I was very dissappointed with the police car because the flashing lights and siren only worked 1/4 of the time. But after a week or so it started to work all the time and still does.The police car was an addition to the GeoTrax Town Train Railway Playset. My daughter loves the police car as she pushes it around the track waiting on the train to come around . The car gets a lot of abuse(banging and sometimes throwing) and is still holding up very well.Other than the siren being a little shaky at first it has lived up to my expectations.
4,Cool sounds,"My son is 29 months and received the railway system and the lighted car for Christmas. The car makes cool sounds - he really likes that. But it doesn't move (except by manual operation), I was a little surprised by that - so I rated this 4 stars. My son plays with the car like he does all of his other hotwheels - no complaints from him."
4,Reference book,"I am pleased with the book, definitely for the more advanced student. Good for someone who writes/reads Greek already and has a good grasp of the basic sounds and spellings. I have been learning seriously, mostly self-taught at home for a few years. It is perfect for me, plenty of new vocabulary and easy-to read tables. Unusual book, as it is all written and explained in good, fluent English. It is best to know English grammar to read it without a struggle."
5,GREAT!!!!,"I have a 3 year old girl who loves this show and couldnt get enough of it from the tv show so i bought the dvd's which have plenty of episodes each she has enjoyed both dvd's, i dont have any complaints. Great dvds for learning new words."
3,Maybe ... Maybe Not ...,"An interesting hypothesis is presented here. I didn't end up giving it the credence it might deserve, but it got me thinking about other angles to what might be lost history. It's an enjoyable read, but really not a book I consider an addition to my library. My recommendation is to borrow it from your public library, or swap me for similar. Having read it, I'm at a loss as to what to do with it. Email [...] with ""Exodus"" in subject line."
4,Excellent design source in COLOR!,"This is part of the Dover pictorial archive collection, so the whole book is designs. The bit I like about this book is that the designs are in color, so you can see variations in light and dark colors, color combinations, colors receeding and coming forward, etc.Some designs are done using just the tile shape, and some depend on designs painted onto the tiles. Some are very bold and simple designs and some are very flowery. Appears to be a good mix of designs from around the world and throughout time.Well worth the price!"
2,None of the patterns interested me,"If you are looking for complex patterns, maybe for a small space like a bathroom floor inset, these may be for you. However, there is nothing here that I would consider covering a floor with. The patterns are very complex and most strike me as in the style of the Middle-East. Again, if this is what you are looking for, you might be happier than me with this book.Also, the author gives no guidance on how to identify and find the individual tiles used in the patterns, so trying to recreate them might be challenging.This book strikes me more as documenting the art, and less as a do-it-yourself guide."
1,I do not recommend this book,"This book is too messy. Lots of typos and the problems are far away from the theory in chapters. Moreover, the problems are ill-formulated so often it is impossible to understand which quantity is required to find."
4,Delicious and a great deal,"I picked up 2 cases of Reese Artichokes on a Friday Sale. These andReese Artichoke Bottoms, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12). Both were well worth what I paid at an average of $.99 a can, compared to $3+ in my local grocery store.These are great chopped up and added to salads, but another great idea is as a topping for baked chicken.In a bowl combine 1 can of chopped artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup shredded parmesan, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 cup mayonnaise and salt and pepper to taste. Then in a baking dish lay out boneless skinless chicken breasts and top with artichoke mixture. Bake at 375*F until juices run clear. Delicious and easy!"
5,just the best,"definitely a keeper. perfect for salads, great in rissoto and pasta. these are just the right size - perfect bite. nice firmness, not mushy, perfect."
3,Bought for school,This book was purchased for one of our children who is in an architectural course that required it. Came on time.
4,Uneven quality,"I tend to get this brand of jerky.However, I always have to actually look at it, because the brand seems to get it right half the time, and then completely screw it up the other half.If you can manage to get a ""good"" batch of this jerky, it is perhaps the most delicious dried meat product, ever. It is perfectly flavored, not stringy or tough, dry in a good way (not the Jack Links bubbly wax texture), and all around awesome.However, the ""bad"" batch is like the ""good"" batch, only as tough as leather.I would advise against blindly ordering these, esp. by the pack.Get some from a grocery store first, and try to see what I mean - the ""bad"" batch always have one side with an odd criss-cross pattern, as if they tried to emulate being ""grilled"" or something.That's not to say the ""bad"" batch is actually bad - it's still quite delicious, just harder to chew, and it's more that it's disappointing, considering how good this brand sometimes can be."
4,Interesting Beef Jerky,"This brand of jerky has its own different, distinck flavor compared to other brands. It's quite a good flavor, I would call it interesting as it tastes different than most jerky's out there. The consistency is good, it has a nice texture, chewy and a bit juicy. It's not the best out there but it is very good in its own way. It has a bit of a sausage taste to it, kind of like a slim jim but you can barely notice it. Also, it is a bit salty. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the ingredients list.This is a good choice if you want a high protein, low calorie, low fat, and low carb snack on the go."
2,Expired and Dry,"The jerky I purchased was expired for roughly 6 months and most of it was very dry. If you think that jerkey can't go bad...well, how sure are you?I still have a bag or two of it sitting around a year later because I don't like dry, hard jerky. It does taste good and if the price is right, contact the seller to confirm it is not expired."
4,great price for a great product,For the price this was a great deal. Not the best beef jerky but it's good.
2,Premium - NOT,"I purchased this beef jerky due to the positive reviews I saw and also because of the price. After I attempted to eat one bag, I was not impressed at all with the flavor or texture of the meat. At least half of the jerky was not edible - it was like chewing a rock! This is still the case with the other bags.Maybe I received a bad shipment, but I can honestly say that I will never purchase this brand of jerky again - no matter how inexpensive it is."
3,Tasted too Salty,"The Pemmican Original flavor tasted too salty. The best tasting beef jerky I've tried so far is Jack Link's KC Masterpiece BBQ flavor. Jack Link's KC Masterpiece is very tasty and sweet.Jack Links Beef Jerky, KC Masterpiece BBQ, 1.8-Ounce Units (Pack of 8)"
1,STALE PRODUCT!,"WHILE THE DATE ON THE PRODUCT IS GOOD, THE JERKY ITSELF IS STALE. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN PURCHASE- NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE VERY SAME PEMMICAN I PURCHASE AT ANY LOCAL STORE. WHAT GOOD IS PRICE WHEN THE QUALITY STINKS!"
4,Delicious Snack,"I picked up a case of this on Amazon because I like beef jerky, but can never afford it (these easy-to-eat bags run up to $6 in stores). During ConAgra Foods' 50% off sale, however, this was not the case!I found the jerky to be a wonerful snack, but it's easy to hork down the entire bag -- all 3 servings. I agree with other reviewers, too, when they say that the consistency varies between bags. Some of the jerky is really tough, and other pieces are tender and awesome. It think this is a problem endemic to jerky in general.I'll buy again as soon as it goes on sale!"
3,OK as disco goes...,"I just listened to the album. I think it's OK, and the influence of Gino Soccio is very apparent if you like his work. The fact that these are covers of ""classic rock"" songs is pretty clear. It seems to be in line with ""disco-rock"" fusion attempts of 1979. For lovers of purer disco, this one isn't a good choice."
3,Pretty Good,"I like most of the ideas in this book, but I warn you to back off on the Tonys. I, too, am from BR, but even I thought most of the recipes were a little too salty or spicy. Easy fix.Other than that, the book is really good."
2,don't last long,"these buffing wheels do the job, they get into all those little cracks and smooth them out. But the material on the wheel wears out exceedingly fast. To give an example: I fashioned a 1 1/2 x 1 inch ladybug for a neclace pendant. These wheels put the finishing touches on the pendant beautifully, but they both were used up and I was left with a small silver round thing and a shank. If they weren't so expensive, I'd give them a five-star rating. But using these buffs will be expensive. Otherwise, I can't do without my Dremel tool, most versatile tool in the shop."
3,Tried sanding wood only,I needed to sand the inside of a routered groove on several things I built. When I saw this I thought it would be great for sanding where the router bit fuzzed up the grain. It worked but wore out so quickly I can't afford to use them for all I have to do. It may work great with other applications.
4,"They Work Well, But Wear Down quickly - Recommended","These Dremel Finishing Abrasive Buffs are an indispensable tool for gunsmithing tasks like preparing metal or wood surfaces for refinishing. These work great in my Dremel but, as other reviewers have noted, they do wear down very quickly and it often takes three or four of these to finish even a relatively small job.Recommended because they work well.CFH"
5,removes epoxy grout from tile and edging,"best way to remove epoxy grout from tile and stone without scratching. however you have to buy a bunch of these, since they wear out extremely quickly."
2,save your money,"I purchased both the abrasive buffs and the larger kit of sanding devices. These lasted less than 5 minutes of careful, less-than-full-speed work. The spindle works ok but not the buffs themselves."
3,Good book but 2nd version not required,"I bought this book to see if it provided any revelations from 2003 - present in the ""new"" 2nd edition. Unfortunately, there was a lot of fluff and nothing remarkable in the new material just reprints from the 2003 - 2007 commentaries in various publications. So, if you have the first book, you pretty much have the second book. I'm returning this one."
5,nice reading,"I believe every one who is invested in money should read. Here is why.I listened to CNN, CNBC, FOOL, CBS and a number of ecconomistsand no one predicted market meltdown . ALL these clownswere wrong and have no clue about ecconomy. This guy has it.I dont know if US ecconomy will behave the way he talks. Butwith every American having a total ( govt, personal, and corp) debot of 100,000/person. Has anyone thought how this debt willbe paid back? The baby boomers who are into retirement is doing so with so much debt, if they cant pay their debt while theywere healthy and in good ecconomy how they can pay back whileretired? When they die who will pay off the debt? no one.I am begining to thing Robert Pretcher's analysis is right.No one will loose money following it. But thinking DOW < 1000. is very hard. But for me thinking DOW < 10,000 in 1999 was ever harder.Paul"
1,Sigh!,"Two thumbs down! Browse through it in the bookstore if you must, but don't make the mistake of buying it. I did, and am regretting it (the book was sealed, you see). I'm surprised to see that this book has an average rating of 3.5 stars... it doesn't deserve more than the one I'm giving it."
1,Total Nonsense.,"Don't read this garbage. Robert Prechter has done a great deal of disservice to America, by spreading nonsense material which has no real foundation on modern economic and financial theory. People will get hurt by following this nonsense. It is sad that in this enlightened new millenium, some people will still listen to people like him. Everyone lost money in the stock moarket in the last two years, including myself, but in retrospect the public was blind not to see the coming tech wreck in 1999. But the equity market will recover sooner or later. Prechter is overdoing now, with no theoretical foundation. He will hurt a lot of unsophisticated readers, and undermine our society."
4,Loss Protection,"The book confirmed a lot of sentiments I had about market cycles by providing a rich set of arguments combined with facts. It also made me alert to developments, which might go wrong and which started to go wrong in the recent years. The book allows to put ongoing developments into a context. So far, it helped me to protect investments and to avoid losses by being a little more alert to unusual market signals. For me, it was a help to define moments to get out of a market. I didn't really got the market entry timing right with it. For finding opportunities, a good newspaper works better for me. Maybe that's due to the gloomy sceenery which is sketched, which makes you extra cautiuous and takes away the courage required to leverage an opportunity."
4,Perfect Timing,"Robert Prechter's timing counldn't of been better. Not only didhe pick the start of the third leg down, he published the book the month that it started.Bob is one of the premire stock market timers of all time. Hestands on the shoulders of Elliott, Bolton, and Frost. Conquer The Crash is a must read. ..."
1,Conquer What Crash?,"Prechter does not bring to light that the institutions that control over 9 trillion in uninvested cash would see themselves out of business. They will soon take advantage of those that swallow this theory hook, line and sinker.Massive gambling is going on betting stocks will go down. Perhaps the largest ""short"" positions ever.When the time comes these same institutions will cause a market rise that will force these gamblers along with the hedge fund business to pony up. It's coming and it may be starting now!"
1,Bob has been predicting a market crash and...,"...and depression for at least the twenty years I've been watching him...does anybody EVER look at his success rate?...about twenty years ago he made something like a million dollars trading futures based -- so he claimed -- upon Elliott wave theory...he then invested that money entirely in treasury bills and started a stock market advisory newsletter...he has been significantly correct ONCE -- TWENTY YEARS ago...if you had followed his advice since then you would probably have gone broke...and he, himself, admits that he keeps his money in treasury securities and doesn't invest according to his own predictions...now, MAYBE he'll be correct again -- SOMEDAY...but do you really want to follow the advice of someone who's right -- MAYBE -- every twenty years?"
2,"This is not a ""How To"" book but a ""What If""","Mr. Prechter's book is interesting and full of the usuall facts he spins to make his predictions. I have had his service too and had written him several times trying to find out his spin regarding his sometime questionable calls. His comments were always the same: Wave Princple's are for guidence and not to be applied as fact when he would blow his call but when he got lucky with his prediction, he would blow the horn aboout how acurate his numbers and formulas were.I read a similar book many years ago, it is called ""CHICKEN LITTLE"" by Mother Goose if you want to read that one too."
2,"Ignores Put Options, Way Wrong on Gold","Fastest way to profit from this still unfinished bear market is to use technical analysis and buy put options on weak companies. John Murphy's ""Charting Made Easy"" (for technical analysis education) and Charles Caes' ""Tools of the Bear"" (for options education), plus Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"" (explains the market's 'seasons' and overall market knowledge) will empower anyone to make $$$. Prechter never mentions put options in this interesting, but flawed, book. Elliot Wavers cannot even agree among themselves.Prechter unbelievably bashes gold, yet gold bullion has already surpassed the price Bob said it would top out at. Gold bullion has risen $50 an ounce from late Oct 2002 to late Jan 03. And the rocket ride has only begun! Interesting, well-written book but ultimately is more of a conversation piece. Better than Wade Cook or the Rich Dad, Poor Dad shill."
4,Complex theory,"The evidence provided by Prechter to support his forecast scenario of a deflationery environment is compelling. However complex theory (or the nash equibruim) tells us that responsive/preventative action will be taken, and has already being taken, to avoid the worst of a deflationery environment. Already the US govt are forecasting a US $165 billion deficit after 4 years of surpluses. Interest rates on hold, possibly reduced . Tax credits have been implemented. The fundamentals are in place and consumer confidence will follow. The risk is now that when the US economy does pick up (forecast for the second half) then it may overshoot. However none of the above takes anything away from a great read and a well researched book."
1,Unreadable charts,"Unfortunately, the Kindle version charts are not readable even when enlarged. The typeface is too small in too many of the titles identifying the lines, hence many of the charts are useless. Even a magnifying glass doesn't solve the problem. The text is worth reading but you need a hard copy to read the charts. Too bad. I'd rate it a ""5"" if I could use the charts"
2,Beware the perma-deflationist,"This book originally came out in 2002. Rather than the deflation that it warned of, there have been (to date) seven years of staggering inflation. The price of a troy ounce of gold was $290 then. Check the price today. It's $953 as I type this.There are reasons to read the book. A person who read it might have been able to predict the panic of 2008 and its consequences. But do not become a perma-deflationist like Prector. The US government has no way to deal with the unprecedented national debt other than to inflate it away or default outright. If the deflationary scenario comes about, your best investments are canned goods, seeds, property with water, and bullets."
1,Grandstanding,"Robert Prechter, using his Elliott Wave Theory, was a bear through the greatest stock market boom in history. He called the 5 Wave DJIA top in late 1993 before the market really took off.This book is a contrarian signal to the notion that we are about to enter into a deflationary spiral. Prechter is consistently wrong.He is capitalizing on irrational fear instead of market moves. He understands swings between optimism and pessimism, fear and greed. He does not correlate these well to market moves.The world economy expands with population growth. Some periods are better than others and regions perform differently. Downturns can be serious or mild. But they occur with regularity. They end without cataclysmic events so often painted by writers like this.I would rate this book in the category of pulp fiction ratherthan serious financial analysis."
3,Too Extreme,"I liked a lot of what the author had to say. Lots of compelling arguments and graphs backed up with some historical facts. Very timely and useful book too.I didn't like the constant references to wave theory and when the author would just ramble on excessively about doom and gloom. It's a bit over done and could scare the uneducated into doing some foolish things with their money/assets if the author is wrong.Shilling, on deflation is a much better book with better predictions and more economics/theorie to back up claims that are made. Shilling had the bond rate history and short term rate history that I was looking for, and some other stats that are hard to find.This is a good book, but take it with a grain of salt, and do additional reading to put the info into perspective. You'll think twice about what the fed does/says after reading this."
2,Bunk,"Elliott Waves...are you serious? If you believe technical analysis, then you might enjoy this book. But I think Warren Buffett said it best...""I realized technical analysis didn't work when I turned the charts upside down and didn't get a different answer"" and ""If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.""The reality of inflation or deflation will be played out - my bet is on inflation - but make your own choice. If you are convinced deflation is coming, then definitely, hoard cash so you can buy assets cheaper tomorrow. Of course you forgo the pleasure of the assets you could have purchased, and the income from investments you could have made."
4,Great book,I believe this to be one of the best investing books in the last year. It gave me a different perspective of the stock market and investing in general. I recommend this book.
3,worth reviewing after the crash of 2008/9,"i've had this book almost since it came out more than six years ago and i picked it up again to refresh my memory on what the raving Prechter got right a few years too early. he does admit he can and will be wrong at times and i think that other readers should take this warning seriously. check out some other reviews here from people that have been following him for much longer and you will get the idea.what it does offer is good insight into deflation risks, hollow fiat currencies and how central banks handle monetary policy to avoid disasters. in that respect, its almost like a playbook for the credit/real estate crunch that started in the US and spread to much of the world."
3,Good advices,"The author provides good practical advices on how to live through the difficult times he foresees.I was slightly disappointed in not finding in the book much of his ""charted expectations"" of how the market crash shall paly out, although he often refers to his other book (""At the crest of the tidal wave"") for this. So I guess I should buy that one as well.Also, not much insight is given with respect to Elliot Wave theory, of whom mr Prechter is an eminent scholar. Apparently the only book the author wrote to provide it is ""Elliot Wave Principle""."
5,Great value,"I have owned this waffle iron for over a year now and it is still going strong.I always use buckwheat flour when making my waffles, and sometimes I also add some ground nuts into the mix, so they take much longer to cook than what instruction book and the little indicator light on the iron says when it should be done (like 2-3 times longer). I have found the ideal way to determine if the waffles are done or not is if they come up out of the iron easily without sticking or breaking apart. Also another (less accurate) indicator is if there is no longer any steam coming from the iron.Pros:1. price is right!2. easy to useCons:1. indicator light is useless2. can be messy if your not carefull with the amount of batter you put in it3. hard to clean, although this is something that all waffle irons have in common.Overall I recommend this product, with it I can make the best waffles around (using my own recipes of course). :)"
3,Paying more for shipping does not provide better service.,"After reading another review, I discovered a CD may not be part of the book I purchased. This is not good. The CD is part of the learning process and allows the student to assimilate the learnings from the book with the CD information. Also, I paid for 1 day fed. express shipping and the book did not arrive on the date expected."
4,User Friendly,I like this book so much that I am thinking about going back and buying it to keep. I had borrowed one for the semester but I think its such a great reference that I'd like to keep it around!
3,College student,This book does have good layout by using seperate chapters for the different systems and has abnormal findings with pictures in every chapter. But It is not detailed enough. I would sometimes find myself looking for more information because it doesn't go too much farther then describing something briefly. I would like to find a more detailed book but this is the one my nursing class required. And it has no glossary for definition of terms.
2,New book did not include CD with it,Although the book was brand new as stated. It did not have a cd included or an acess code for the evolve in the book. Most sellers include these features when its brand new! The features are needed to see how an assessment is done on a patient! The videos and excercises in the cd or evolve put the textbook's ideas into action. Without the supplement of the cd or evolve it makes understanding the concepts more difficult.
4,Text for physical assessment,"This book is very detailed and concise, with an excellent focus on system review, very nice pictures are included at the end of every chapter."
5,One of the most engaging productions of a drama ever filmed.,"This production of the classic drama is extremely well done. The actors are superb, the editing nearly flawless, and the overall effect exactly as Thornton Wilder himself would have wanted it. I use this in my classroom and my students are impressed with the number of name actors (Stoltz, Miller, et al). The video, rather than film, quality adds to the effect of seeing a live performance. In short, this is engaging, educational and entertaining. It's about time the video went on sale."
1,"My church has spent thousands removing ""tags"".",Wish you would stop painting on others property. If you want to express your art buy some space and paint away. How would you like it if I made you put on a suit and tie every day? not your style? Well having your tag on the side of my building is not my style so lets keep our styles to our selves and don't forces our selves on others.
2,The life and times of street artists,"This book shows a glimpse into graffiti's past on a multicultural level. Spanning American cities suchas New York and San Francisco to abroad in Montreal and in Paris. Through Interviews and pictures ofdie hard urban artists"" All City"" documents the art of getting up and the life styles of these streetartists."
3,good for beginners,"I am a starting goalie on my women's hockey team. I have been looking for more info for goaltending. I bought this VHS hoping to get more info. Ultimatly I found the info to be very basic, which would be great for a hockey player just starting out in net.It covers basic stance, butterfly saves, some saves while in the butterfly, stick saves, some glove and blocker use, and some body use, and some footwork. It is more up to date than most videos out.But I found flaws in the information, the goalies were going down for almost every save, most of which they didn't need to. Very few times did they stay up for a save. As most goalies know, less is more, why tire yousrself out with all the extra movement.I did find some of the information useful, but I feel this video is geared more for the beginner goaltender."
1,Changed my sweet puppies personality,My puppy loves the bully sticks but with this item she became very aggressive when we tried to take it away. Let her have it again with the same behavior.....it went to the trash.
3,Good CD,I really like this CD. It has some of the fun classic hymns on it.I would recommend this cd to anyone. My only complaint is that some of the songs are a little faster and jazzier than you sing in church.
4,Nice versions of classic hymns.,"If you like classic hymns that are not jazzed up then this is for you. I really enjoy how the music is very simple - nothing electric. it is a very good CD when you want a break from other Christian pop music.However, there are a few things I did not like which is why I only gave it 4 stars. First I did not like the Amazing Grace version. It's just a personal preference but I felt like it was trying to be jazzed up and it did not work for me. And second, I was dissapointed that 3 of the songs on this album are repeats from the Hiding Place album.What I found great was the literature inside the case that gave a history of where each song orginiated from and how they have been altered slong the way to come to be versions that we sing in church. That was well done.All in all it's a great CD. But, I have the Hiding Place which is a great CD and if you have to choose between the 2 I would choose Hiding Place."
5,A Classic,"I've owned this cd for over a year now and this is my absolute favorite Christian cd to listen to. I'm always searching for a fresh sound and quality music, and this one did it for me. The whole cd is awesome. Both the arrangements and vocals are excellent. This cd is nice to worship to by singing along to it or it is just as nice to layback and listen to and meditate about God. Some of my favorites are ""Be Though My Vision"", ""Amazing Grace"", ""It is Well with My Soul"", ""By and By"", ""Power in the Blood"" and ""Just a CLoser Walk with Thee"". If you are looking for something old, yet a little fresh, give this one a try. In my opinion, every song was sung, arranged, and produced with perfection."
3,Mixed Review,"Their voices are excellent and I really love some of the songs, but as with many albums I don't like all the songs. Some, like 'O, Sacred Head Now Wounded' are very worshipful, but some of the others seem to be more to entertain than to worship."
5,Greatest hymns,My husband and I love this DVD. The hymn truly are great hymns. I grew up in the Congo so of course I love the two songs on the DVD that are sung in the national dialect and in the style African style of worship. Takes me back to Congo every time.
3,Just okay....,"Well, i guess since I started reading Suzanne's trouble shooter's series, I got used to having to read different characters in one book. I feel like this book is really short for me. but i still like the story. It's not as engaging as the other stories that i'm used to reading from her. The kid is funny and she sounds really smart for her age.Well, for the price I shouldn't really expect a really long story. It's something that I will re-read when i'm in the mood for something quick and funny."
3,Not half as good as Blimey,"Well, we all know (Matthew Collings more than most) that New York isn't London -- but unfortunately that means that MC's gloriously aphoristic tour of the Brit Art scene in the excllent Blimey! doesn't really translate when it moves across the pond. This is heavier, this book, not as funny, without the same sort of dip-in-and-pull-out-a-gem quality. If you want a great insider's guide to the New York art scene, check out Anthony Haden-Guest's True Colors instead."
5,Love this toy,"Very soft and durable. My toddler LOVES ""moo cow"" and sleeps with him at night and plays with the puppet during the day. We will be getting more!"
2,A Little Disappointed,I thought this puppet made noise like the pig that I bought that oinks. I was disappointed when I realized that it didn't.
4,GOOD RARITIES COLLECTION FOR HARD CORE FANS,"I picked this title up in a dollar store. The sound quality on the first track was rough, but it was otherwise a great acoustic performance by the Stray Cats. Happily, the sound quality improved further on in the disc, and the performances continued to be strong. This is well worth having. The band sounds loose, and are obviously enjoying performing songs they love. If you have nothing by them, I would suggest getting a conventional best of compilation first. There are several. However, if you like your rock and roll served up raw, or are a devotee of the band, get this."
3,"Short, but good","Shoppers should know that this book actually contains only 19 small pages of Galbraith's words. While his speech is a good one, it is surprisingly short. The rest of the 54 pages is filled with introductions, thanks, afterwords and platitudes that were given during this inauguration of the Senator Keith Davey Lecture Series."
5,Still ministering to me today!,"I have had this CD for years...I still listen to it just about every week. I keep the music in my car. My favorite is ""Like A River."" Depending on what's going on in my life, this song is able to move me to tears, even though I've listened to it for years. I also love ""You are in the Waiting."" It came along just when I needed it...and still does. Awesome lyrics, and the gorgeous voice of Shannon Wexelberg. Every song is wonderful and will minister to you for years to come! This CD is the story of MY life!"
4,"Nothing really surprising, but some good facts.","This book is filled with interesting tidbits about birds. If you were expecting anything that you can't find on the internet, this is not the place to look, but I still am glad I have it. It makes for nice review."
4,fermenting crock by harsch,"would be a four star except for no ceramic on weighting stones or lid edge. heating in hot oven does seem to prevent problems with mold so far. otherwise, excellent investment. we use other type containers but this is way easier, very well constructed and packed well for shipping."
1,"Poor quality glaze, seeps","This crock was recommended for pickling with fermentation. Unfortunately there are unglazed specks in the finish through which the brine seeps out and salt crystallizes on the outside with the potential of ruining the floor or other surface. I sent an email to the manufacturer asking if this was normal and seeking advice, but received no response after several weeks."
1,don't get unless you want your dog eating plastic,our dog ate right through the plastic on this this - and swallowed the pieces. he ended up hacking them up later :(
2,Too Easily consumed,Although my dog is a Chihuahua she was able to whittle away the plastic outer chew. It is not chew proof even for a small dog. Bits of plastic can be easily swallowed by your pet. I would not purchase this product again even though the idea is great.
5,Awesome bones,"This is a great product for large dogs who are powerful chewers. They last longer, hold the dog's attention and are easily digestible. My order came promptly...I thankyou and my 130lb. dog thanks you."
1,Awful,My dog chewed off little bits of the edible inset and they were all over the house. They are hard and hurt when I stepped on them. My dog got tired of it very quickly. I finally threw it out after about a week.
4,good chew toy,"My dog loves this chew toy because it not only helps with his dental health, he gets little bits of tasty treat as he works through the bone. Of all his chew toys, this one is his favorite one. Also this chew bone does not fill him up with unnecessary calories, like the huge dental chew treats."
4,Dog Loves It,"My cocker spaniel loves this chew so much that there's no hope that I'll ever get to throw it away. It's been chewed up so much that it's almost not recognizable. It has reduced his need to chew one rawhide bone a day, but I'm a bit uneasy about allowing him to chew this much longer.He's had it for over 2 weeks now. When I first rec'd it, I also noticed that it was made in China, so I checked all the pet recall lists to ensure it was safe. There was no mention of this bone being part of the wheat glutin problem, so I gave it to him. Every responsible dog owner needs to be aware of the recalls (btw) before handing over toys, treats and food to their pets. I'm going to have to wait for my cocker to ""look the other way"" so I can replace this with a new Hartz Chew N' Clean. :-)"
2,DOES NOT LAST! destroyed within the hour,"This thing is great for a smaller dog maybe (< 20 lbs) but my 35lb half-shiba, quarter-german shephard quarter-pitbull gnawed through this thing and ate the inside treat-like stuff within one hour. Outside plastic is still there & he still likes to chew on it, but for a lasting method of dental cleaning... it simply does not cut it for a bigger dog. Better just to get one of those stippled bones or ribbed plastic rings."
1,Doesn't last,"I bought this from Walmart to try and give my dogs a treat and not wanting to run all the way to petsmart. Needless to say, The bones were both chewed up within thirty minutes. In fact, I am pretty sure they both swallowed some plastic. Dogs do not understand only the middle is edible, and the plastic is easily broken apart. My dogs were chewing on all of it, eating it like one of the edible nylabone bones. (both of my dogs are under 50 pounds, as what is on the label).Also, after taking them away, the middle edible part would not pop out, so overall I couldn't give them the edible part after i took it away.I would NEVER recommend these to anyone. I'm hoping my dogs do not have complications from the plastic."
1,Bad for Small Dogs,"Don't give these to your dog. Small pieces of plastic get chewed up and damage dog's intestinal tract. I had to take my dog to the vet and $600.00 later, vet determinedshe ate the plastic from this product."
4,Keeps dogs busy,this bone kept even my large dog busy for days and she usually chews up a toy in a few hours. She loved the flavor too and would get upset if I tried to take it away
2,Dogs Not Wild About This Toy,I brought this hoping that my 5 month old black Lab puppy would satisfy some of his need to chew. The puppy did not like it and neither did my Great Dane. I was very dsappointed! Will not buy this again and I feel like I wasted my money on this toy.
2,Not the best,"My 4 year old lab/shepherd/beagle mutt didn't understand that the only part that was edible was the inner portion of the toy. I have to say that the packaging is not clear at all about this either - the rest of the bone is not supposed to be eaten. I had to take the toy away, break out the edible portion and give it to her because she was just eating through the whole thing from one end to the other, nylon bone and all. So, 3 days after I spent $6 on a dog toy, it was in the trashcan. I really don't consider my dog a chewer, so I was really disappointed in this toy/treat. I will say that whatever they use for the edible portion was apparently super-yummy to my dog."
5,"we call it the dogs' ""crack bone""","I used to buy these in the Target near my home and they quit carrying them. Thank goodness I found them online at amazon.com. I have 2 dogs and one is a little over a year old but since she's not out of the ""puppy mischief stage"" yet, I can give her this bone and leave the house and she doesn't touch a thing. She's too busy with this bone. Both of the dogs LOVE them."
4,Lasts a LONG time!,"I was looking for something for my greyhounds to chew that would keep them occupied and away from the kids' toys. These are great and last a long time! They've been chewing off and on for almost 2 hours and they're no where near finishing them. I anticipate these to last at least a few days, even with my big dogs.The only downside is that they contain wheat gluten which can be a problem for many dogs with allergies. Great concept though!"
1,I have 3 pit bull mix puppies who chew everything...,but they would drop this as soon as I gave it them. It made a loud clunk so perhaps it was too heavy. They were about 20 lbs at the time. My daughters 6 yo lab mix liked it more. Wasted $$ in my book.
2,Not for chewers,"This toy is not very durable. I gave it to my pit bull mix, and within 20 minutes he had chewed through the plastic to get to the treat in the middle. I had to throw it away. The plastic is not very durable at all, I guess this could be good for smaller dogs."
3,Not Durable Enough for a Large Dog,"My Irish Wolfhound puppy loved the taste of this Chew. However, after a few minutes he had chewed off chunks of the plastic. Cetainly not a safe thing for puppies to be eating."
4,great for vigorous chewers,Have to bulldogs and they love to chew on everything. This product was able to withstand the constant chewing that they do.
1,Didn't last long,"Part of the product description says "" Delicious sizzlin' bacon flavor that keeps them chewing for hours."" It lasted about 10 min before I had to take them away from my dogs. They chewed up the plastic trying to get to the treat in the middle and I was afraid they would eat the plastic as well.It is hard for me to find items that my dogs can't\wont chew up quickly. I have 2 yellow labs and they seem to be able to destroy just about every chew toy I've ever tried. Personally this product doesn't work for my needs so I would not buy this product again."
4,Hartz Chew N'Clean Dental Duo,"My pug loves the Hartz chew n clean dental toy. He's blind and not very mobile, but gets much enjoyment from this bone."
5,Great toy for bullies,"We have had three bulldogs who enjoy these chews. They will go to the toybox and retrieve an old one or chew vigorously on a new one. Our dogs haven't chewed through the plastic. They just work on the edible part, and Bella has figured out how to clean the bone in record time. Three bullies give this treat a paws up!"
3,Not Really For Large Dogs,"Package says its for Large dogs, I disagree. I have a Lab/Pit Bull mix and she is an aggressive chewer. She had this destroyed in less than 15 minutes. She ate the edible parts and spit out the plastic pieces."
1,foe the chew n clean,this producut is horrable my dog is not a big a big dog and he sredded it.and im very angery with htis product.DONT BUY IT FOR UR DOGS BAD BAD PRODUCT.
1,Don't Use This Product - CONSUMER SAFETY ALERT!,"Hartz is a terrible company with a horrendous record of making products that are harmful -- and often fatal -- to animals.Their flea and tick products alone have generated more than 33,000 reports to the EPA of injury and death in the past eight years.Don't support this shameless corporation!Google ""Hartz kills"" or ""Hartz victims"" and see for yourself!"
1,Battery Latch Broken - HP Lost Computer - Claims No Responsibility,"Amazon is a great company and have many great buys on line here, however HP Buyer's please be wary. If you never have a problem with your computer, you will likely be happy. However if you send it in for service, you may be in big trouble. I sent mine in for a broken battery latch. This, by the way, was extremely weak for the task of holding the battery in the housing. However, the worst part is that I shipped it to HP under warranty. HP service is now claiming that they shipped it back to me, however they can not give me a valid tracking number. They say I should take my troubles to Fed/Ex. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am out the cost of the computer as far as I can tell and HP is claiming no responsibility. HP LOST the computer."
1,This computer is a NIGHTMARE,"Warning. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.We purchased the 40gb disk version and got it home to discover (eventually) that the internal modem (analog connection) was faulty. This took a day of unpaid beta testing (yes I am angry) to work out and eventually the shop, Karstadt, in Germany refunded our money (on our second visit - the first visit they insisted we test it with a different cable). So that was two days wasted. Then we went to another shop and bought the 60Gb version. Yes, the modem worked and we could log on to the internet. Then the problems really started. The computer crashed and then recovered and each time the period of OK working was shorter until after the third crash it was crashing as soon as a connection to the internet (a different service provider each time) was made. On Monday I expect to take it back and demand a refund and waste another 4 hours of my time (after more unpaid beta testing.Do yourself a favour. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
5,A Must Buy!,"Great features, lots of speed and room, big keyboard, 10-key pad and all the ports you would want!Aside from the weight, this has been a wonderful and reliable laptop for my business. I highly recommend this.The large and wide sreen works great with presentations, makes viewing spreadsheets and databases easy!Highly recommend it!Sincerely,HeatherAssistant For You!http://www.assistantforyou.com"
1,Motherboard died - HP can`t repair,"I also had the problem of the ""blown motherboard"". As I read now, this is a common problem with this HP.I live in Argentina and HP-Argentina won't even try to fix it. I have to buy a new notebook.Rating: 1 star for the HP Pavilion zd7010 and 1 star for HP customer service. I would rate them with a zero, but Amazon doesn't give that option."
4,The Next Guys?,"Maybe the most underrated band in rock history, The Knack is back with a great new CD. ""Les Girls"" and ""A World of my Own"" are hands down the cream of this crop but the whole album displays the band's penchant for writing catchy hooks backed by awesome musicianship. This is definitely a worthwhile purchase."
5,I,"I just recently discovered this 'new' release and ,as usual-it's fantastic!!Granted, you HAVE to be a fan of 'power pop' to like the Knack-but the lurking question is-"" WHY AREN'T YOU??!!"" This once famous band writes and plays arguably THEE best power pop songs ever!!If you even at one time liked 'My Sharona'(some of us STILL do!)then you owe it to yourself to get ALL of this band's material which is,I think, available on their website. Oh,and by the way-the song ""One Step At A Time"" was originally on their excellent,slitely harder-edged 'SERIOUS FUN' c.d. from 1990 or '91. This version is mellower,but still a great song!So if you 'got the Knack' in '79-don't be fooled by idiotic critics-as they have prooved over & over to be musically devoid of taste!! Get The Knack again in 2002!! ENJOY!"
1,Quality Poor,"I was very disappointed with the two ashtrays I received from ANTONLINE. The amount of sand in the bottom was negligible. The rim of the medal was so rough, I cut myself on it. Poor workmanship. Will not use this company again. Tried to reach them before I wrote this to no avail. Sincerely, Paula"
5,A Real Eye-Opener,"This is the third book I have read on the horrors of Bataan. GHOST SOLDIERS by Hampton Sides has a great narrative momentum, and TELL MACARTHUR TO WAIT by Dr. Ralph Hibbs is a notable first-person narrative.CONDUCT UNDER FIRE, however, is more sweeping in scope and, consequently, gives the reader a greater sense of how widespread - - and therefore all the more horrifying - - the atrocities of World War II really were.Although this book may seem as detailed as a history textbook to some readers, they will finish it feeling well-rewarded for their effort. For those who have had little exposure to this area of history, the book will be a real eye-opener."
1,Not happy with this product,"If I speak too softly my voice isn't picked up at all. In turn I have to repeat myself all the time. I recently picked up a Jabra retractable. It's not quite as cool looking, but it works WAY better and it's smaller."
1,Doesn't work,I loaded this onto a brand new HP machine running VISTA. It doesn't work.Also I can't get any help. A real waste of money.
5,Helpful to scholars and beginners,"I find this Old Testament Introduction easy to read, but also reasonably comprehensive. It is not as complete as R. K. Harrisons' 1970 work, but much more inviting. It is both a handy reference work, and a book to read from cover to cover.The New Testament applications at the end of each article are thought-provoking and essential for the Christian, for whom the New Testament opens and explains the Old.Highly recommended."
5,Live Classics,"This is a truly great album, definite must have for anyone who is interested in the really good music.Patricia Kaas is one of those very rare kind of performers who sound live even better then in the studio and she is really shines on that record..."
1,Jack who?,"Please don't confuse this rubbish with the awesome collaboration between Steve Kilbey and Grant McClennan (r.i.p.) that bears the same name. I'm actually quite surprised at the folks from Amazon for not making this distinction. This product should not be recommended to those that dig the Church, Go Betweens and the like."
1,i want my money back,"I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic."
3,interesting,"As the old saying goes ""What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just cant reach so you get what we had here last week. Which is the way he wants. Well he gets."" that pretty much somes up the book. I was expecting more. I think it hits some issues right on but misses the clarity that you would find in other books like Roy Williams Secret Formulas of the Wizard of Ads. Maybe the next book will be better."
1,"Boring, boring, boring. . .The One-to-One Coma","These guys should have stopped while they were ahead. The Fieldbook was awful too but I felt bad about writing a review for that piece of garbage. With this book, I think the co-pilot of that Egyptian airline read it and. . .well you know the rest."
2,reformulating the obvious,"Are you sitting down? This book tells us that the internet is changing the way business is conducted! When you've recovered from that breathtaking revelation, you may be ready to learn that customers are Very Important to businesses. The authors like to capitalize their endless platitudes: ""Learning Relationships"", ""Lifetime Value"" and when capitalization ceases to impress, we get acronyms: CRM, MPC. Wow! This is ground-breaking stuff.And the examples! Would you buy a book touting British Airways and First Union Bank as positive examples of customer-sensitive businesses?The good news is that, containing little but air for b-school types, it's a quick read. That gained it an extra star in my rating."
3,An okay Pac-man game,This game could of used some more levels in it and is should be a little bit more fun to play as well
2,Broke in less than 10 months,"When I first received this vaccuum it worked very well. Unfortunately, it only lasted 10 months before it just stopped working without any symptoms. Worked great for the price, but the price obviously shows itself when it needs to be replaced annually."
5,EUREKA DID IT AGAIN,RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS EUREKA BECAUSE MY $200 DOLLAR VACUUM HAD TO BE SENT BACK TO THE COMPANY I PURCHASES IT FROM ...VERY POWERFUL VACUUM FOR THE MONEY...EUREKA IS A COMPANY YOU CAN COUNT ON....
2,Better than nothing,I've used this unit once and the canister is already cracked. ?? Don't know how that happened. Not worth the money to send back. I gave two stars because it is lightweight and easy to push.Sad. I use to think of Eureka as the benchmark all other vacuums should strive for. Would not recommend it.
2,Great for a year,"Edit: less than a year after buying this vacuum, the power switched has crapped out. It turns on when I press the red button, but won't stay on once my foot is off. You get what you pay for. Also, in the past year I have gone through ~5 belts. If you suck up anything on accident, ie shoelace, shirt, etc, the belt snaps almost immediatelyOriginal review:I love this vacuum cleaner. I don't have particularly bad messes to clean up, but it picks up anything I ask it to (including puppy-torn toilet paper...a lot of it, on a thick carpet). It feels like its of quality, and I like that its yellow. It almost seems like it has a self-propelling function. The canister is really easy to use, and the filter comes out and is able to be rinsed to maintain suction. The height adjustment is handy since we have several carpet depths. I would recommend this product."
3,Cleans well but belt broke on first use!,"I was quite happy upon assembly and first use of this reasonably well-designed, convenient, and economically priced vacuum, which would have been fine for my small condo had it kept working. Unfortunately, the belt broke 10 minutes into its first use and one would have to wonder at the overall quality of the rest of the unit if its components are that shoddy. OK, belts are cheap but not sold by Amazon so I am now waiting 3-5 days to be able to try again. The unit should come with at least one extra belt. I am not confident about the long-term prospects and would not recommend it for anything other than occasional or light use."
5,Great Vacuum Cleaner for Excellent Price & Appropriate Task Use,"I have one room that needs to be vacuumed (medium-sized carpeted bedroom) and this is exactly the vacuum I wanted. It is lightweight and easy to store. It picks up everything appropriate smoothly & quickly & thoroughly. It was fairly easy to put it together once out of the box (there was a couple of places where some careful reading & studying had to be done in the manual to figure it out). You do have to watch for the hose popping out of the base of the vaccum when pushing it under things like beds to reach out-of-the-way places, but it is easy to push back into the nozzle. Shipping was excellent, the package arrived in perfect condition and in good time. Overall, this is a an excellent vacuum for price and task, and probably best for smaller houses, offices, or apartments. I suspect it's better to pay a bit more money for a vacuum for bigger areas or heavier usage."
4,Best Cheap Vacum,"My wife had one of these before we married. When I broke it I was surprised to see that it was a ""cheapo"". I thought this bag-less cyclonic technology was reserved for the $300+ vacuums.Just a note the last Eureka broke due to my cleaning the filter with soap and water and not allowing it to dry. Which takes probably over a day unless you use a hair dryer. I ran the old Eureka and it sucked water and soap into the motor and it died. That's the only reason we had to replace after 3.5 yrs of apartment use.So I ordered a new one on Amazon and got free shipping. It got there in a day or two I was so surprised! This was during a promotion. These guys (at Amazon) are like psychicswhen it comes to luring you into buying from them."
3,"Really Great, but.....","I bought this on the fly when my old reliable Eureka died. I was amazed at how efficient and powerful this machine was with one major issue-when emptying the canister the accumulation of filth on the filter is nasty. In order to clean the filter I have to use a fork to dislodge the dust accumulation, which leads to dust flying all over. This is honestly the only complaint I have. Because the filter is grooved, it accumulates quickly, and it requires that I dislodge the dirt each time I use the machine. I will be looking for one with a bag. More expensive long term? Yes, but worth the money so that I don't have to clean a filter. Redesigning the filter might address the problem."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,I have had this item only 2 months and the belt has snapped 3 times. It also has a bad odor. Thought because of the reviews this might be alright. My house isn't nasty or anything but it does need a good vaccum. This ones not for me.
3,"Great on carpets, not so good on bare floors.","This vacuum cleaner is light weight, good looking and does a great job on carpets. However, all it does is throw the dirt around on my bare wood floors. Since most of my floors are bare wood, I am not particular enamored of this machine. Sigh . . ."
1,Vacuum Motor went out in 9 months.,I bought this vacuum in Feburary and it was ok at first but then I noticed when you vacuum it spits the pieces back into smaller pieces and just gets deeper into the carpet so it looks clean but it is not. I figured this out because one day I was wearing shorts and could feel the vacuum spitting the dirt on my legs. The other problem is the fact that the vacuum didn't last even a year I bought it in Feb. and the motor went out in Sept. and it is not work fixing. I would say 59.99 is not worth it for this vacuum.
3,This thing blows!,"Oh, it's powerful enough. But 1. It blows exhaust in the direction you're cleaning. 2. Won't fit under a 24"" table. 3. Is bagless, meaning you gotta spend time cleaning the @#$%! filter. 4. Is quite fragile -- If you bump the front cannister just right, you're gonna hafta replace the whole thing. I shoulda spent $60 more and got a bagged cannister. These will fit under and around anything. The best thing I can say about this vacuum is that it's headlight is powerful enough to frighten any cat or house pet! Sheesh! We can put a man on the moon, but can't make a vacuum that doesn't disturb what's suppose to vacuum up. Stoopid!"
2,Can't turn off the beater bar,Most importantly you need to know that you can't turn off the beater bar. I suppose you could remove the belt that drives it but doing that is not very convenient. So you can either use it for carpeting or use can remove the belt & use it for hard floors.
2,Descent on carpet. Bad on bare floors,"Pros : Cheap, Light, you can see when you have to empty the canister (basically after every use with a cat)Cons : Loud, Hose falls out of hole, Blows everything around on hard floors and spits debris right back at your feet.Took 3 laps around my apt to see that i only blew the dust around and then I gave up and went shopping for something better. It did do well with cat hair on carpet though.$60 = Disposable vacuum"
1,If 0 stars were an option...,"This vac is THE most annoying, useless piece of machinery I have ever encountered. We live in a 1000 sq ft condo, all carpet, with a King Charles spaniel, so admittedly any vac does some overtime with the dog hair. This vac can *almost* manage to clean 2/3 of the place before it burns through its belt. A vac that needs a replacement belt every time you use it? I don't think so. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you want to stay sane! Inexpensive = cheap in this case."
2,Maxima 12A Up Vac,"My husband bought this vacuum for me for Christmas because it is light weight an easy to use. At first I thought it was a wonderful machine because it would throw dust & hair/pet fur around and I thought this just showed how bad my past machine was. Also it was amazing to see just how much dirt was being picked up after just having used my old machine. That was the 1st time.The 2nd time I realized that it was the bad design of this machine and perhaps all other Eurekas that cause the hair/pet fur/dust to go flying around. THE FAN IS ON THE FRONT OF THIS MACHINE NEAR THE FLOOR BLOWING DOWN ON THE VERY SPOT THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO VACUUM! Although this machine does a good job picking up dirt, it takes me THREE TIMES the normal time to vacuum than it did with my old heavy machine...not good. I've never owned a Eureka vacuum before and will not own another because of this major flaw."
1,Broke within two months,I used this machine once and then the brushes stopped spinning. Will not buy again and nor should you.
1,this vaccuum is terrible!,I bought this vaccuum 2 years ago and I have never emptied it and there is a tiny amount of dust in it. Instead of picking up dust and dirt this vaccuum just blows it around.
2,iz it working??,"i bought this because it had a bare floor adjustment.i have mostly hardwood floors. covered by area rugs.this is the 4th ""bagless"" i've bought in less than 2 years.works great the first time until it gets filled up with dog fur.they all end up in the trash. i hate cleaning them.the belt in this one burnt out in less than SIX MONTHS !!ridiculous....the dirt and dog hair gets STUCK in the tunnel and i can'tseem to clean it all out. my dryer vent is easier to clean out than these bagless things !! and i shouldn't have to pay $60 to have it cleaned every month either !! so, no more sucking power andall my dirt goes spitting out the bottom of the unit back onto the floorfor me to sweep up. back to square one. hose is definitely not long enough to reach up into corners and ceiling fans.it was a complicated assembly. heavy.i, too, have a problem with the hose remaining stuck in whereit is supposed to be. last bagless i'll buy because they allwork the same and not up to my standards."
1,Cheap and not useful,"This vacuum broke within a year. The filter constantly clogged and the air exhaust was in front of the vacuum, thus blowing away everything I was trying to suck up. Dumb design. Cheap materials. Bad product."
1,Dont waste your money...,"Poor suction, Air filter cloggs every time and it shuts down after 15 min use. DONT BUY..."
2,Pictures and description don't match product!,"Ordered after looking at pictures and description. I noted some discrepancies with the pics and the description. Description mentions ""auto height adjustment and headlight"" Neither of which are on the vacuum I received! As per the description: ""Other features include a powerfully bright headlight and an automatic height adjuster,"" Furthermore the ""belt view or performance window shown in the pictures of the product don't match what I received either! Neither does the canister. Mine has a yellow tint to it, while the ones pictured have a clear canister. Frankly I am disappointed in the misrepresentation of this product.As for the vacuum, it works fine, but is rather noisy."
1,this is a POS!!,"Bought this a few years ago for a lake cabin that collects lots of sand and dog hair... this thing is a complete POS. Don't waste your money. It spits whatever you are trying to vacuum out the back and barely picks up this tiniest bit of dirt. We would have returned it but didn't want to sacrifice a vacation day dealing with the hassle. If I could have rated it with ZERO stars, I would have..."
5,Great!,"My mom had actually found one of these in the trash because the previous owner had clogged it with some kind of power you put on the carpet and vacuum up, but they did it when the filter was wet (that is a BIG no!). We cleaned it all out and it worked like new. It doesn't overheat; it gets the floors clean, and is pretty light as far as Vacuums go. It is pretty loud but I guess all Vacuums are. I liked it so much I bought one for my new apartment. I also love the fact that you can get the filter wet and clean it."
2,Only for the carpet,"This vacuum cleaner does not even have floor setting. All you get is low carpet or medium or high. And it works great on the carpet. If you have hardwood, linoleum or tile like we do, avoid this vacuum cleaner. When previous reviews said that it blows dust in all directions, they really mean it! In my living room where there is a lot of space for dust to move around I can vacuum back and forth 5 times and still not get everything, because this vacuum does such a great job scattering dust bunnies in all directions. On at least 2 occasions I had something of a dust storm in this room created by vacuuming. It was easier to pull the hose out and try to catch items in the air rather than trying to vacuum them off the floor. I got this 3 months ago and was hoping that I would find a ""better"" way to use this vacuum cleaner. But it looks like I just need to buy another one."
1,"Terrible,cheap lousy design",It's just pain useless....especially on tile/wood floors. Don't waste 1dollar of your money on this piece of junk.It just blows the dirt around.
3,Parts,Received Unit without Owners Manual or any Hardware to put it Together. Good thing we have a Fully Stocked Shop!!!Maybe thats why Amazon sells thing so Cheap!!!
1,Terrible Vac,"Had this vac for a few months and it was terrible. Cheap with low suction motor. Motor burnt up and caught fire after a few months. My house only has two rooms with regular cut carpet, but this vac couldn't even handle that. Don't buy. There are way better vacs if you spend just $20 or $30 more. Better to spend a little bit more now than a whole lot more later replacing this vac when it finally breaks."
2,Chintzy Piece of Junk,"We bought one of these for our store, which has hardwood floors plus some mats. My first impression of the vacuum is that I have played with higher-quality toys in my youth. I have jokingly designed a label for it which reads, ""Do not use near open flame -- appliance may melt."" The plastic is so cheap and thin, parts of it will dimple and bend permanently if you press on them too hard. And unless it's set to the absolutely lowest setting, it will not pick up grit at all, only dust. It is also so lightweight, the brush action grabbing the carpet will pull the thing forward, right out of your hands. It was inexpensive, sure -- but there is a quality threshold you just shouldn't go under, and this is way under that. It works for now, but next week? Next month? Craigslist, here we come."
4,Works great-powerful,"I now have two of these powerful vacuums. They are a great value for the money. Only draw back, and it is managable, is that filter does it's job very well but needs cleaning out often. I would buy a third one if I needed it."
1,This doesn't suck... But it does blow.,"This is the vacuum they use in ""Bizzaro World"". It doesn't suck up dirt and mess; it creates it. For use only on April Fool's Day and Opposite Day. I'm giving it a Viking funeral this weekend."
2,Going Back To Bags...,"This is probably the lightest upright out there but the filter clogs easily and the vacuum will overheat and shut down. Simple stuff like pet hair will quickly clog this canister. It's a shame, too because for the price this is a good vacuum just with a lousy canister design. I can't believe that these Eureka engineers didn't distribute some prototypes to real users/homeowners before putting this out on the market. The design flaw is eay enough to fix. The vaccum also will drag across low pile area rugs with its auto-adjust height mechanism. These canisters are a mess, too...I miss the bags now. These filters on these canister jobs are all lousy...be it Bissell, Eureka or otherwise."
1,GREAT FOR A GAG GIFT!!!!,"FIRST: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM IF YOU HAVE PETS OR CHILDREN!!! I am very serious! I happen to have both animals and kids so please trust me when I say that this vacuum is going to be a huge let down if you buy it. I have had it for less than a month, I vacuum every day and it worked great on day one. After that, it just kept getting worse and worse. The filter clogs on every use (mainly from the dog hair), the hose comes out constantly, and the suction from the hose is horrendous. I hate dishing out negative reviews but I felt a strong need to warn off any potential buyers out there."
1,a waste of money,"If you want your wife mad at you buy this vacumn. A total waste of money and time!!! Poor suction, air filter is clogging constantly, filthy when you have to empty it, shuts down when it picked up a small piece of paper, have to unplug for 30 minutes. They lost their marbles when they designed this vacumn!Could not even give this THING one star, it is that bad!!!!"
1,"No suction, a hassle to clean up","The suction is non-existant, and cleaning up the filter is not worth the hassle. My advice, invest on a good vacuum sure you'll pay a lil bit more but at least your carpets/floors will be clean."
3,Great vacuum with one flaw,"This is a really powerful vacuum and I love it. But one flaw. The lower end of the hose come off from the hole VERY easily. Sometimes I am almost done vacuuming and realize that the hose is off and vacuum the whole room again.... TIP:Make sure the hose is securely inserted before and during vacuuming.August 24, 2007My vacuum stopped working! I bought the vacuum in June. Since a few weeks ago, the vacuum started showing the major defect, which is OVERHEATING! I can only use it for at most 20 minutes. After that, the vacuum is overheated and shut off itself. I called Eureka's custmer service and they claimed that it was clogging in my vacuum and not the product itself is not defective. Well, I bough the new filter and and belt to see if that would change the overheating problem but NO. I do not recommend this vacuum. Please also see other reviewers' comments with the same problem."
2,Broke in 2 years,"This is a great vacuum cleaner when it works. The first time I used it I was amazed at how much dust it collected. Unfortunately, like most modern vacuums, it is made entirely of plastic. I repaired it under the warranty three times. The fourth time that it broke I tossed it. It was no longer worth my trip to the repair shop every 4-6 months to get it fixed."
5,Eureka Lightspeed vacuum,"I don't know how this will hold up as it was just rec'd, but wow is it powerful - it picked up dog hair that the last vacuum just left behind and the cleaner the area got, the faster the vacuum went across the carpet. Seriously, the first time it was slower as it was working on the hair and after the 2nd or 3rd time, it just flew across. it was simple to put together and easy to empty the canister. Even if it doesn't hold up, for $60 I know I'll get my money's worth!"
1,overheating and horrible customer service,"This is the second of these vacuums I have bought. The first still works fine but this one began to overheat and die just a few months after I bought it. I wasn't worried because it was under warranty. Unfortunately, the customer service was HORRIBLE and they would only honor the warranty if I mailed them the vacuum and then, after receiving it, they would either fix it or charge ME for the shipping if it 'worked'. Since the machine was intermittently working and not working and didn't cost much more than the shipping costs, I decided not to risk it. I got rid of it and will never buy another Eureka vacuum again. Truly the customer service was that bad. I got a similar light-weight Hoover which only cost a little bit more and has much better suction and feels much better made."
2,disappointment,"After using this vacuum just once I found several problems with its design and was inspired to complain about it here. It was a cheap vacuum, but still a bad deal.As several people have noted the exhaust ports actually point forward, and since it is a powerful vacuum cleaner it really blows dirt around. Not only will you be chasing dust bunnys across wood floors, you'll also need to dust after you finish since your vacuum cleaner just blow all the dust you wanted to vacuum up into the air.My second issue was that the vacuum cleaner is extremely loud, and it's impossible to turn off the beater brushes. So not only is it pretty worthless for wood floors but it tries to eat all my rugs too. So what a bust, wish I'd read amazon reviews first."
3,It blows things away...,"I bought this 4700D vacuum last week. It was my first bagless vacuum.Assembly was easy. Tried it out and found some good and bad things.It was lighter than my old upright by Hoover. Not too noisy, suction is good, maneuver was very easy.After a few minute trials, I noticed the bad things: the frontal exhaust vents blow strong air that blow everything in front of the vacuum path away that instead of vacuum the dust, it stirs up all the dust in the air!!! I called the company line; I was told that was by design, not a good design though. The lady told me to get one with exhaust at the back so things would not be blown a way.Then I checked the dust bin. The dirt was easy to get out from the bottom lid; but the filter was already clogged. No easy way to clean it up. I tried to shake the dirt off, the dusty air made me sneeze unstoppable. Not sure if that's the common problem or just this one."
5,Best Vacuum EVER!,"I bought this vacuum for myself with little expectation for it only to be absolutely amazed, this vacuum works wonders my room mate and I could instantly smell and see the difference in the floor after vacuuming. we have five cats so finding a vacuum that works good is a hard thing. I loved the vacuum so much that I proceeded to buy it for my mom who owns 12 rescued cats, she has spent hundreds of dollars on vacuums only to find this one only 60 dollars that outdoes all the rest, save your money don't buy all those expensive vacuums that don't work, buy this one its worth the money"
4,Good value,I bought this product about two months ago. It has great power and hasn't given me the clogging or burnout problems other reviews have mentioned. I am careful to empty out the canister and clean the filter regularly though.
3,pushes stuff around,"I have this Eureka Maxima blue model #4704 and i have the sam eproblem as reported before, when I vacuum the vent that's in the front of the vacuum actually blows air and pushes dust away ahead of the vacuum. Before I can pick it up, the things are all flying around all over the place. It's powerful and lightweight though."
2,Eureka 4700D Maxima Bagless Upright Vacuum,"Eureka 4700D Maxima Bagless Upright VacuumThe Vacuum, is ok..... It sucks in more ways than one.....When you turn it on it blows all the dust all over the place. Maybe it is not good for wood floors? If I had all carpet I guess the carpet would hold the dust? Not sure. I would have liked to known this prior to the purchase. Also when you bring it to the upright position it doesn't go in one easy motion. You have to sort of bring the handle up while holding the base down. I do however like the easy canister removal and emptying along with the filter which is reusable. You can even throw it in the dishwasher. I don't recommend if you have wood floors, better for carpet."
1,Did not work right out of the box,"Didn't get much of a chance to review this item because it did not work right out of the box. I assembled it, turned it on, and the belt would not turn. This meant that the brush would not turn, which meant that I wasn't going to pick up much on a rug. It was nice and light, though, and easy to assemble."
1,Terrible vacuum,This is a terrible vacuum. It started having problems two months after I purchased it. I brought it into a repair shop because it was still under warranty. The person said he couldn't do anything because the problem is the machine overheats and you just have to wait until the unit cools down and empty the container each time. It takes me over 3 hours to vacuum a 600 sq. ft. because this unit overheats after 15 mins of use. Worse vacuum ever!
3,vacuum hose pops,"This is a great little vacuum for rugs. Has a nice pick up of dirt and dust from rugged area.This vacuum does not do floors without blowing the crumbs around. You have to go over the floor areas several times to finally get all the crumbs. You must make sure to push the hose completely into the unit, if it is even a little loose the hose will disconnect and the vacuum will not pick up anything. There is no way to wind the cord on the machine so you have to loop it up around the handle. Don't have pets so I have no idea how it would handle pet hair. The canister is easy to remove and empty. For the price, it is what it is."
1,NO SUCTION!!!!,"I would give this ZERO stars if they let me. I bought this because it was lightweight, easy to maneuver and claimed to have powerful suction. The first time I used the vacuum it was on carpet and it worked fine, but it does not work well on tile or hardwood floors! It literally just blows the dust and dirt around! The vents on the vacuum are (unbelievably) in the FRONT of the vacuum! And the hoses get clogged VERY EASILY. DO NOT BUY THIS, no matter how cheap it may be."
2,Works for a few months- but not much longer,"This appeared to be a great vacuum for a few months. Despite the overpriced filters, it seemed to pick up most dirt and carpet trash without a problem. However, at about four months old, the suction power in this Chinese piece of junk started to get weaker and weaker- and by the end of the first year it was pretty much worthless. There were no clogs and the engine appeared to be working fine- just no suction power. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone."
2,This Upright is plain wrong!,"There are more things wrong with this cleaner, than there are right! When vacuuming, the wind created by the motor blows everything to the right sided and around the room. The hose flops off the body of the cleaner when vacuuming, where the methods which to hold it tight against the body are too big. I had to buy strips of velcro to keep this from happening. The extension cord is not as long as other cleaners I have owned. The vacuuming ability is average, where a couple or few passes will pick up the dirt. Overall, save your time and money or buy a different cleaner. This one sucks (or not very well!)."
3,Nice and light but with a little problem,"This is an easy to assemble, use and clean product. However, only problem I have with it is the fact that the the pipe that connects the vacuum with the upright container keeps coming loose during use- at the floor unit end. Its a pain to watch out for it and shove it back in but other than this problem, the unit is easy to maneuver and light. It is also pretty easy to clean- at least I don't have to guess if the dust bag is full!!"
2,Not built for a big room!,"This vac will not do a large room before the filter clogs and the thermal overload kicks it off. It is worthless for a gift shop daily cleaning. Also the first time trying to take the filter out was a pain as the book is wrong, saying to turn the top of the dirt holder. It pops up. I would not buy one again and am looking for a bagged model."
2,"Only had two weeks, broken belts twice","This vacuum does have great suction power for the price. It is also very lightweight. However, I have some beefs. It seems to really blow the dirt around in front of it before it picks it up. Two out of three uses the belt has broken. That is really annoying. Also the hose does not stay plugged into the socket. And I don't like the way that you have to wrap the cord over the hose in the back. I don't know, maybe I got a defective model but I don't think I would ever buy this again. I hope I can get a belt to work on it."
1,Crap vacuum,"I bought this vacuum about 2-3 years ago and at first I was very impressed with the suction. But gradually and starting about 6 months after purchase, it began losing suction. The vacuum spins dust and particles through its brushes and out the back on to your feet. I cleaned the filter religiously which is quite challenging since the filter can't just be dusted,it has to be washed and dried completely before further use.Yet, the vacuum became close to useless and I have used it in conjunction with the broom for the last year or so. Well maybe 2-3 yrs is about the life span of a vacuum because I was just using it and it just stopped,dead..completely not working. Trust me..spend the extra and get a good vacuum. I am getting a Dyson next."
2,MAXIMA BAGLESS VAC,EUREKA 4700D MAXIMA BAGLESS UPRIGHT VACUUM. I BOUGHT THIS VACUUM FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE USED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND IT STARTED SMOKING AND SPITTING DIRT OUT FROM UNDER IT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE NO MONEY FOR SHIPPING TO SEND IT BACK. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1,EUREKA SERVICE IS HORRIBLE,THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE! I ORDERED THIS PART 10 DAYS AGO AND HEARD NOTHING - ZERO FROM YOU THAT IT WAS ON BACKORDER. I WROTE AND E-MAIL INQUIRY - NO REPLY. I CALLED - FINALLY GOT HOLD OF A LIVE PERSON AND ALL SHE COULD SAY WAS IT WAS ON BACKORDER. YOU COULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME THAT???I ASKED FOR LOCATION LOCALLY TO GET THE PART AND WAS TOLD - I DON'T KNOW - MAYBE A LOCAL VACUUM DEALER LIKE EVERGREEN. THIS IS THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN A LONG TIME. I WOULD EXPECT SOME SORT OF APOLOGY - YOU PEOPLE KNOW IF I HAVE A CENTRAL VACUUM SYSTEM FROM YOU I CANNOT CLEAN THE CARPET WITHOUT THE BELT - AND YET YOU CAN'T INFORM ME IT IS ON BACKORDER???I'M SO DISGUSTED WITH EUREKA SERVICE - I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM YOU AGAIN. IF I CAN FIND A WEBSITE TO ADVERTISE YOU LACK OF CUSTOMER EMPATHY - I'LL GET IT THERE ALSO.
2,Filter Pain,"I think this is a fairly good vacuum cleaner, it does get the job done for not such a bad price, but what bugs me is that the filter gets clogged waaay too often and long before the container is even half full, it is also VERY loud. This is definitely not a heavy duty appliance and the only reason I kept it is because is very lightweight but I won't be using it for longer than a year tops."
2,Quit working after 1 year,"We bought this vacuum just over 1 year ago and it already quit. We tried to fix it but the bottom part where the brushes spin was smoking and warped to where it's not possible to fix. Considering 3/4 of our house is wood floors and tile, we don't have much carpet we're vacuuming. We also don't have pets so there's not excessive hair to wear down the parts. I'm not impressed with this vacuum at all."
2,too heavy,"filter clogged every time when emptying container,the cord is on the bottom and you walk on it constanly.this machine weighs too much.also the machine does not lift over items when in the operating mode. i advise anybody to buy another as i will be buying another due to the inconvience of this one, i will however buy from a store where i can examing the machine."
2,Broken after 12 uses,"I bought this vacuum on sale at Lowe's for $35. I figured it would be decent enough since we only had a 5x8 rug to clean. We owned the LightSpeed for two years and only used it 10 times before we moved to an apartment with wall to wall carpet. On our second time vacuuming the new apartment it started to make funny sounds and smoke was pouring out. Now it's completely useless and way out of warranty.Before it completely died on us, it worked okay for what we needed (hence the two stars instead of one). It's extremely loud for something so small. Light weight with decent power. I have owned other Eurekas, Bissels, Electrolux, Hoovers, etc. and this one was by far the loudest and least durable. Would not recommend and will not buy again."
2,Hard to assemble and very loud,"I recently purchased the 4700d to replace a Eureka bag vaccuum.Although there are only 5 screws, it took me half an hour to assemble it. The target hole of the first screw was not fully drilled out and it was extremely difficult to attach the handle to the base. I ended up having to pry open the plastic to create a hole. All of the screw holes are very tight and it was difficult to get the screws on the suction tube attachment tight enough to form a seal.Eventually I did get it all assembled. It runs, and does suck up dirt. It is also the loudest vacuum I've ever used. If you hope to run the vacuum while someone is resting or concentrating, think again. This scared the dog so bad he pooped on the floor.Well, guess it's good that I bought a vacuum then!"
2,Died in less than two years,"The product works OK, although the filter design produces dust clogs if you are not careful. This vacuum died in less than two years of light usage. OK for the price, but I'm surfing for a new, more expensive, non-Eureka vacuum when I finish this review."
1,Don't buy this vac,"This is the worst vac I've owned. Other reviewers had the same problems I've had. Hose pops out all the time and spews dirt around, Wind shoots out of vac moving dirt around. The filter is too big for the canister so dirt piles up on it rapidly and it clogs and has to be taken out and cleaned. Cleaning it just took me a fair amount of time because you don't just dump the dirt off of it, you have to bang it against a fence or whatever over and over again, during which the dust is flying everywhere including over me. Because of the poor design of the hose it's a clumsy vac to use. It overheats rapidly and shuts off. It does have strong suction but that doesn't make up for having to go back over areas because the vac has redistributed dirt where you've just cleaned. Yes it's cheap, although I paid more than the Amazon price, but when you realize it's money thrown away it doesn't seem so cheap.Don't buy it."
1,This is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever owned,"This vacuum cleaner is horrible! The design of it makes it so that the suction hose gets clogged almost constantly. I spot vacuum almost every day and vacuum my entire house once per week, I have no shedding pets and yet I still have to remove the canister and unclog the hose where it enters the canister after every room. I had to totally take the vacuum apart twice in order to remove a clog and in the 6 months I have owned the vacuum the belt has broken twice. I would not recommend this vacuum, it is a total waste of money. Spend a little more and get one that actually works."
2,Motor burned up after just over a year,"The Eureka Maxima Bagless worked fine... for about a year. The only downside is that it did not do a great job on bare floors, tended to blow light dust and dust bunnies away from it. Emptying the receptacle was pretty easy and I never had to replace the filter. Just kept cleaning it, which worked fine.However... and that's why I gave this vacuum a poor rating, the motor just quit after just over a year. I took it to a repair shop and the repair cost would have been more than I paid for the vacuum. My previous vacuum was an old Hoover that I owned for nearly 20 years, without any problems. Not saying Hoover is better than Eureka, just that a motor should not burn up after just a year of use, and not that heavy a use at that.I would not buy another one, though it's going to be tough to find one that does not have similar stories. Seems like most vacuums have problems these days."
1,Terrible!,"First of all, works great for the first couple of weeks, then forget it! The cord is horrendous, doesn't wind well, tangles and knots easily, you can NOT ever get it straight again! The canister does NOT fit tightly. Shoots stuff out the back while vacuuming, so it seems like a never ending process. Hose and attachments are small, the upholstery brush always falls off. I bought a replacement filter hoping that would help, but no.(I cleaned the original one after every usage) I hate dirty floors, and this one is not even good enough for the everyday quick cleaning, I am sorry. Maybe I got a bum vac, but I do not think so."
2,Fantastic...for a year.,"This vacuum lasted us a good year, which, I guess is ""OK"" for $60. First two months it worked fantastic. On the carpet, cleaning out the car, not so much on hardwood or tile. (It just blew the dirt around.) Half a year later, well, it's working about half as good. (Replaced the filter at this time too.) Still only half as good. A year later and no suction, period. Disappointed."
1,Worst vacuum I have ever purchased,"This piece of garbage is not worth any price! Intake clogs, filter constantly needs cleaning. Bag vacuum only choice! A total bust for Eureka!"
4,Eureka Bagless Vacuum,"Vacuum worked great the first two times it was used. After that it seemed to not be picking up dirt off the rugs. Upon further examination it was determined that the belt that drives the beaters had broken and was gone. After emailing Eureka about the issue, they sent a replacement belt. Most of the floors this is used on are laminate. I am curious to see if the new belt lasts any longer than the original. Interesting item is the reason we purchased this model. We run a small business and have one we use at the shop. The beater belt has never broken on that unit in two years and it gets far more use than the one at home."
3,Poor filter placement,"There are quite a few reviews of this vac so I'll get straight to my chief complaint about this vacuum cleaner and that is the filter placement inside the bag-less canister. The filter gets dirty very quickly and the dust cakes on to it and it's not very easy to clean. You have to take the filter outside to clean it as dust flies everywhere--really messy. It's, unfortunately, a poor design. I say unfortunately, because otherwise it's a fairly decent vac for the price."
2,Very disappointed,Hate that it blows the dirt or dust before you even get a chance to suck it up! Literally chasing trash and trying to suck it up! Only positive thing about it is the lightweight and the lightspeed! Hate it!!!
4,this is good,"I've been using this vacuum for a few months now and haven't had a problem yet. The only thing I don't like, is the air that blows out the bottom of the vacuum."
2,Would NEVER buy another like this!!,Would NEVER buy or recommend this again to anyone. I thought initially it was great but it only took a few uses to change my mind. I can't use it at all now and feel like I threw the money away. It's incredibly loud and noisy. The hose keeps/kept coming out. Filter was a pain to lock in and now I can't use it at all. I read the reviews before I finally purchased it but it must have been a different vacuum!!
2,Not pleased,I just don't find it picks up as well as others. I keep the filter clean but it just isn't great.
2,Loses power gradually and becomes ineffective,"I bought this item about a year ago from amazon. We have a two bedroom-two bathroom carpeted apartment for which we wanted a relatively light but effective vacuum with no hassles. It worked well initially picking up fine particulate dust, small bits of paper, dry food matter and hair. It gradually lost its suction power over a year that we continued to use it. Although its motor still hums and the bagless container still accumulates dust it fails to pick up hair, visible fine particulate matter like food, cereal, paper etc. I cannot say that it does not work because technically it's still 'alive'. I had initially given it more stars but after using it for a year I beg to differ."
3,Was ok at first,"I bought this item after doing research on this site and looking at various reviews. It was really great when we first got it two (maybe 3) years ago. We had a dog at the time and I think picking up his hair (not to mention the cats') really did a number on it from the get go. It is not always easy to push on our rugs and that makes it tiring. The other thing is, this was our first experience with a bagless, and I actually think it is more of a pain to use than the bagged kind. You have to clean the filter and that involves actually washing it. So you can't use your vacuum until that dries out. Then to replace the filter is anywhere between $16 and $20 per filter, which is another pain, and not every store carries it. The vacuum is so cheap now (because it's an old model at this point), it's not even worth continually buying a filter for that cost. I am now in the market for a new vac, perhaps a canister model--definitely bagged."
3,Lots of assembly required,"Nice product but be prepared to do a good bit of assembly. There are a lot of pieces. We passed up on the Hoover, which comes ready to use right out of the box, because this one had the lower price. A mistake. Took us over an hour to get it all together. One piece has screws that must be tightened but which are down sink-holes so deep and narrow, neither of my two screwdrivers would fit. I had to got to two stores to find one that would work. Buy the Hoover."
5,WONDERFUL ITEM !!!,easy to assemble and the suction is fantastic ! you will not do better for the money ! buy it !
1,Broke after one use,"The vacuum has a warranty... except for the belt that spins the carpet cleaning component. Guess what broke after one use? Yes, the belt. I suggest that you avoid this product, and pay a bit more for a better vacuum. You, unfortunately, get what you pay for with this thing."
2,Broke,I bought this less than 1 year ago and it just shut down and does not work. It never really picked up that well but I was living with it. Time to find a new vacuum.
4,Eureka 4700D,"It's a vaccum. I assembled the model with a little help from the instruction book. Easy to do. I tried it out both on our hardwood floors and low carpet. Picked up gross stuff just fine. The only problem is the hose keeps coming loose from the main part. I just pop it back in. If, that would annoy you than maybe wrap a piece of tape around the hose to give it a snugger fit. It hasn't driven me to trouble shoot the matter. It's a fine vaccuum for the price. I'm a huge fan of the bagless features. I deducted a star because the hose doesn't stay attached."
4,Great for a cheap Vac,"I bought this when my more expensive vacuum died, just to hold me over until I could afford to get a nicer one. This vacuum appears to be really decent. It works very well, has great suction. The hose does come loose really easy, but even if it does come loose, it didn't spray dirt all over like some had suggested."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE THINKING YOU ARE BUYING AN ELECTROLUX.THIS IS A EUREKA THAT IS CHEAPLY MADE.I HAVE SEEN THE ADVERTISING ON OTHER SITES OF ADVERTISING ELECTROLUX WHICH IT IS NOTFALSE ADVERTISINGWATCHOUT / BEWAREALOT OF SCANDALS OUT THERE.
5,Major bang for the buck!,"I had limited expectations for this vacuum cleaner - I mean, how much can one expect for $69.99? My intention was to use it for quick pick-ups between ""real cleanings."" And then I was shocked to see how easily it outperformed my ""serious"" vacuum cleaner, especially on cat hair, as I have two of those shedding monsters. Moreover, it is light enough for me to easily take it up and down stairs, and it is so compact that it is easily stored even in the smallest of homes. This is a winner!"
2,Stay away from this one!,Thankfully this piece of junk was a christmas gift because I would have been one unhappy camper if I wasted money on this! It worked fine the first 5 times of use. I went to vacuum one day and only vacuumed my hallway and the belt broke. I replaced the belt with a Eureka U belt as recommended and I vacuumed this time only half of my bedroom and the belt broke again! I took it to a local vacuum supply/repair place and they said the breaker bar was flimsy/cheap and not rotating properly thus causing the belt to break and therefore rendering the vacuum useless. I was told I could spend $20-$30 on a new breaker bar and I said I'm not wasting any more money. I think I will go back to Hoover.
2,Not for bare floors,"This vacuum is useless on bare floors. I don't know if the brush is too fast, or the suction is too low, but if you are hoping to pick up tiny particles, beware. It looks like it has picked them up, but you only find out later that they are spun out and under the unit, hitting your leg. To be fair, it does a decent enough job on carpet and is light and easy to move around.The belt on my unit broke after a few uses but it was fairly easy to get a replacement and change it. It has been working since (more than a year)."
3,"First worked great, then didn't","I initially loved this vacuum - it is light and had amazing cleaning power. But... after 3 months the rotary brush stopped spinning. Now the hose vacuum works fine, but it doesn't work well for carpet cleaning. it should have worked a lot longer. Plus, small design flaw, the cord hangs out the back in an awkward place so its too easy to step on while vacuuming."
4,Had 2 Redo My Feedback,I still love this vacuum. For $44 I cant complain.It shipped fast but I can say that I had the belt break problem. I have gone through 2 belts so far and Im wondering whats going on!Make sure you have a supply of belts for this vaccum.Next time Id get a more expensive model.Cheaper isnt always better :)
4,Eureka cleaner works well.,"Happy with the preformance, the only fault found is with the hose easily popping out when not appropriate. Overall, like the cleaner very much, nice and light too."
4,Great for the Price,"I am happy with the way the Eureka 4700A cleans my carpet.My last vacuum, that was more expensive, did not clean the carpet half as well as the Eureka 4700A does."
4,I like it a lot - a good buy,"I have used this vacucum a couple times since I bought it. It is a great product,Pros -lightweight,DOES pick up hairs!!!noise is durableeasy to manuvure.Cons:The hose seems to come off easily. It seems if the hose could be a little bit longer, this problem will be gone.It does take a litte time and screw driver to put it together, but it is not bad, still easy to do.Overall, I think this vaccum is great, fits my needs and worth the money."
1,quality,"I am a former employee of the Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Company in Bloomington - Normal, ILL. And we built quality and since they moved to some third world country the quality has gone down to cheap. The canister filter get plugged up and does not clean up well. The little clips and catches do not hold up well. We have an old Eureka from back in the day, 1987 and while it is battered from use it is still better than this one.J.D.Bloomington, ILL."
4,Great vacuum for price,This vacuum has great suction power and also works on hardwood floors. It picks up dirt that hasn't been vacuumed for years.
5,great vac,works very well for me no complaints like some of the other reviews maybe they should learn how to us a vacuum before complaining
3,It Okay!,Vacuum does what it suppose to do. But having trouble with attachment brush staying on the hose & hard to put in hose. So time consuming when attachment brush falls off of hose.
3,The power is good!,The vacuum is powerful and quite good for carpet floor. Not fancy but easy to use. The only inconvenience is that one needs to assemble for the first time.
2,overheating problem,"All that others say about how this vacuum cleaner is small but powerful, attractive, and conveniently lightweight is true. The price is fantastic. With a two-bedroom apartment, I felt I could trade in my clunky full-size vacuum for this attractive model. Unfortunately, after only 6 months of use it has developed overheating problems. Now I have to let it rest between rooms because it so easily overheats. Too bad! But I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Lasted for 2 years with couple of belts being changed,"This was our second purchase and just like the first one, Eureka Lightspeed 4700D model lasted for 2 years and in those 2 years have had to replace 3 belts either due to being burnt out or just too tight that the brush roll wouldn't turn.Its a hassle buying the belts since they are not readily available but its cheaper than buying a new one Vacuum cleaner.This one is going into the trash since its expensive to keep buying a new belt/brush roll every other year but other than that, it worked great!You expect Vacuum cleaners to last for 5+ years with little maintenance but its a pain when you don't have belt on-hand and need to vacuum the house.My next purchase will not be a Eureka :("
1,Wear shoes!,"This vacuum seemed like a great deal...but it really sucks! Sorry for the pun, but the first time I used it, it was great; however, you need to empty it 2-3 times per room. The hose is a bad design so you often have to take it apart to clean out the hose. Also, wear shoes while vacuuming, because it shots any grit(like cat litter) right out the back at your feet."
1,Overheating vacuum????,"I was initially impressed with the vacuum until it began to shut off randomly while cleaning only one small room. Little did I realize that the vacuum overheats and automatically shuts off after less than 5 minutes of use! After owning several vacuum cleaners over the years, I have NEVER encountered this problem before. This is the second Eureka that has gone bad on me within the last 2 years. Not recommended!"
2,Good for carpets,"This is good for carpets. Just carpet, it picks up everything but hair. It scatters everything on hard floors. The hose is rather short, heavier stuff(cheerios, small pebbles, and chucks of dried mud like to stay in the hose that is impossible to clean out. The filter clogs very quickly. Dust flies EVERYWHERE while emptying."
4,Great Value,"My previous Eureka, which lasted for 9yrs, decided to go on strike. I saw this product on sale and the purchase was sweeter with the addition of a gift card. Easy set up and great power. It's sooo easy to maneuver and almost has a self-gliding feel. The dump mechanism is sooo much easier than what I was used to. Its a great purchase!"
1,I'm throwing it out!,"I have used a paint-on liquid bandage before and loved it. Here are the reasons not to buy this spray.1 It smells really bad like new plastic shower curtain and the smell lasts.2 To mask the smell, they have used a strong scent of clove.3 It contains a lot of alcohol and acetone and stings when you spray it on an open wound. My 9-year old cried when I sprayed it on a small open blister. (Acetone, the main ingredient is basically fingernail polish remover. Who thinks of spraying that on a wound?)4 It takes a long time to dry and in the meantime, if you don't hold the wound level, it drips. (Picture dried shiny drips running down your shin.)5 When it does dry, it feels like a dried cornflake stuck to your skin.6 It is nearly impossible to peal off in the event that you don't want a smelly, dried cornflake, stuck to your skin or you want to rid your shin of dried drips running to your ankle."
3,not as good as the bottle with a brush,"This is much messier and harder to use, but I would recommend new skin. If you have a blister or a small cut and want to go play a sport such as baseball it is much more effective to use liquid bandage than a bandaid"
5,One of the best megaman games out there!,Now this game is so cool. Its better than the frist and the 2. Its got a better story the controls are great and the cyber elfs are easyer to use and its just fun its one of the best GBA games out there and its hard to find so get it fast!
4,You've Gotta get this Game,This is going to be GREAT!I owne the first and seconed and reveal a new chapter.I gess that this is the end of the Zero's quest.The seconed game was better then the first one so this will be the iceing on the cake.
4,It fits well and tastefully into the current offerings for children's entertainment,"This is a comic adventure of the type made popular by the animated television series. The premise is that a baby sheep was left on the doorstep of a human named Momma Mutton. Momma has weak eyes, so she names him Johnny and raises him as a human. He learns to walk on his back legs and he is intelligent, even when compared to human children. He goes to school and does well, although he fails miserably as a basketball player. After deliberately losing in the finals of the school spelling bee, Johnny discovers that he loves water ballet and he goes on to win a large number of Olympic medals.I found the artwork and coloring excellent and the bizarre premise was amusing. It is not cerebral, but fits well and tastefully into the current offerings for children's entertainment."
1,Boring,Why the Department of Personnel would have anyone read this for promotional testing is beyond me. Put together a few five dollar words and fragmented thoughts and you're an expert on supervision. This book was as interesting as watching paint dry. It should come with a noose so you could hang yourself after reading it!
1,Don't Read Unless You Have To!,"Why the NJ DOP picked this book for testable material is beyond me? After was all said and done, 3 months worth of reading of this boring, choppy, unrealistic supervision theory book the DOP only asked 12 questions from it. Author lives in Fantasy Land when it comes to police work, especially in NJ. Come up with a few distinct ""buzz words"" and a littney of lists on police tactics, and you to can write a boring book like this one."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"WORSE POLICE SUPERVISION BOOK I EVER READ---BUY YOURSELF A LOTTERY TICKET INSTEAD---I HAVE READ MANY-MANY SUPERVISION BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE WILL CONFUSE ANYONE--PURE JIBBERISH--"
1,Long winded.,The only reason anyone would read this book is because it was listed as required reading for a promotional exam. Mr Whisenand is out of his mind and should limit his writing to something he has firsthand experience in. Read this book only if you are having insomnia.
5,Five Stars just isn't enough!!!,There is no way that you can give five stars to a tribute album that is a tribute to the most influencial black metal band of all-time. Just the bands that cover the songs should be reason enough to buy this album. The songs are done in true and powerfull form. The gods of the dark should be very pleased. What a way to give thanks to the ones that introduced us to the music we now enjoy.
5,The Naked Capatalist,It didn't read like a novel but was very informative of the communist influence in our country. It explained Communism that I hadn't known before. This is a book I will read again and undoubtedly learn much more the second time.Earlene Babcock
3,Quigley's Own Words More Interesting,I also purchased Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope because I wanted to read the original source. Quigley was a very interesting person with some non-typical perspectives on history. I enjoyed his book much more than Skousen's interpretation of it.
5,extension + quick change,It's one thing to be able to extend the reach of a hex driven bit with something that holds it firmly. It's another to also be able to quickly change it out without the chuck jamming up. So this is the only brand I've found that can do both reliably.
2,worked great for about 4 hours a month for about 4 months,"Worked great in the beginning, but I only used it evey other week for about 2 hours, off & on. I never used it in a hammer drill or impact driver, just to spin screws out. The rubber o-ring broke, but it still worked. Then later the bits would fall out. Now its pretty much worthless. Good luck finding out where they warranty these. It's supposed to have a lifetime warranty, but no one including Milwaukee tells me how to get this replaced. I wouldn't suggest buying one."
4,Great accessory !,"I bought this in both 6"" and 12"" for use as an accessory for my Dewalt 1/4"" impact screwdriver (my favorite tool). It's chuck accepts the same bits as the Dewalt. It's a Milwaukee, so you know it's gotta be well made. The only thing that kept me from giving it the fifth star in the rating is the fact that the chuck is just a bit ""Bulky"". I would recommend this to anyone looking for an extension for their 1/4"" Hex tools."
3,Bit is stuck in extension,"Love this bit extension, however I have had the tool for about two weeks (used) every day with my new m-18 impact/hammer drill combo and now the bit is stuck in the extension and can not be removed. I would recommend the tool for any homeowner but not for anyone in the construction field."
4,There will be stars...,"I liked everything about this extension... the size, the feel, the look, the functionality. It's very handy for increasing my drill's range and usability in tight spaces. However, while working on a cabinet project in my kitchen, the extension simply slipped out of my quick-change bit adapter that is semi-permanently installed on my power drill. The extension then proceeded to fall (in painful, slow motion), hit my granite countertop, and chip a small piece out of it. Am I totally sure that it was the extension's fault? Not totally (I'll answer my own question), but in the 10 years I've used the quick-change adapter, I've never had a single bit fall out. And by now, I'm pretty good at putting bits in and feeling how secure they are. But, now there's a chip in my counter, so someone's got to pay! And they'll pay in stars! Sorry Milwaulkee! Mwahahaha!!!"
5,"""Bright Moon"" is Terriffic!","Exciting! Every chapter is an adventure. The growth of this courageous and loving young couple as they raise five children in the inhospitable Northern Alaska town of Candle, near the Arctic Circle, is a wonderful book for all ages. I especially liked the love and caring for their sled dogs. The change from a chauvenistic male to a loving and caring husband and father is the underlying theme as far as I was concerned. A fine read!"
4,Found what I needed,"At a time when face masks were in high demand and out of stock at many retail outlets, I found these at a reasonable price and in a small quantity (20). I didn't mind sending for them across the country. They arrived within a week and in good condition. They offer sufficient protection when you are concerned about being exposed to airborne illnesses, or don't want to expose others when you are ill."
2,Be carefull Coleman Powermate went bankrupt!,The Coleman Powermate company went bankrupt around 3/17/2008 so there's no support for the product!
1,This is a Childs hat!,"This hat is tiny!!!!! it's a Childs hat, they don't mention this in the ad. No i have to pay to return it after all the shipping i paid. Avoid this seller."
3,"Good designs, but only half as many","This card is all applique designs, but you can skip the applique steps if you want to. This card has half the designs of another Brother card called ""Best Pals."" The ""Best Pals"" card can be found for under $99, so if you want to most designs possible, it might be a better buy."
3,Reasonable chisels,"I purchased this set of chisels based on Jesadas reputation as a maker of router bits. As it turns out the chisels are of British manufacture most likely imported by Jesada. They are a decent tool and hold a reasonable edge, however the blade angle is much too acute for work in hardwoods. I worked a piece of oak with one of them and found that the edge had within 4 minutes developed nicks. If you intend to use these chisels with maple,oak etc, you better have a Tormek or similar sharpening system and regrind the edges to approx 26 to 28 degrees."
3,"Not their best, but has their world famous track on","Ocean`s debut is quite a tame affair, save for the title track, which should be know to everybody born before the mid-60s. Not bad, but not sparkling, though. It was not until their second album, ""Give Tomorrows Children One More Chance"", that they got their sound, colour and proper arrangements together."
4,Good Folk Music is Always Good to Find.,"The songs from this Cd will bring back the ""Folk"" era for you. A message in each song, and an emotional set of songs. The recording is really good. The instruments are easy to identify, and the vocals seem to appear from a wide soundstage. A fun Cd."
4,Where there's Sandra Brown...,"This book shows Sandra earning her chops as a thriller/romance writer. She packs quite a bit of emotion into the plot, with some twists that the reader ""almost"" dosen't see coming. She also tackles some serious social issues into this book, which makes it a more serious read than her romance genres."
1,Waste of Paper,"I do not think there are enough words to describe how frustrated I was after finishing this book. I had to force myself to continue. The hero, Key, was an egotistical jerk, and not in the dashing, romantic way. He was extremely judgemental, hypocritical and cruel. I could not find one endearing quality in him. As for Laura, I liked her at first, for her determination and intelligence. But she turned out to be just as disappointing. She actually fell in love with the jerk, yet still couldn't be honest with him. I regret the time I spent trying to enjoy this book. To all potential readers, do not waste your time. Instead, read one of S.Browns better thrillers, like The Witness, or French Silk."
1,Where There's Smoke - there's nothing.,"I usually enjoy Sandra Brown's work, but there's always an exception. I've only read 30 pages of this book and it's already so boring and predictable, I can't bear the thought of wasting my time finishing it."
5,Incredible performance by the timeless Lynda Carter.,"This is a great story, involving and romantic. The characterisations by Lynda Carter are so convincing, heartfelt and sensetive you will laugh, feel tears in your eyes and be totally absorbed by the story. This is the first audiobook I have ever bought and I hope Lynda Carter does more of them. I also enjoyed this my first sandra Brown experience. A winner combination of an excellent narration and style and a great book. I was really talen aback my Ms Carter's ability to create different voices, it's alarming, and you will feel that there are different people in the room with you! She also manages to switch from different and heartfelt emotions that you will find heartwrenching with such ease, style and class. A big thumbs up, Five stars, with no small thanks to the incredible Lynda Carter."
1,wow!! love this one,"I have been reading Sandra for a while now and while ""where there's smoke"" is not my absolute fav (envy is, and is a must read)it ranks up there in the top three. the twist and turns keep you glued till the final page and you are not going to want to put this one down. Sometimes a little rough in places( name calling and such).But all in all a very good book."
3,I Agree the the Review by C. Thomas!,"I Agree with C. Thomas ReView ""Sandra Brown"" Can Do and Has Done Much Better! the Story was Slow in parts."
2,The Hero was a really big JERK!,"Like other reviewer, I also think this book is not one of Brown's best story. This story to me at times got too predicable but the worst part of the book was the hero. Key was so MEAN! He kept on calling Lara an adulteress whore but, yet, he was sleeping with a married woman too. Through out the whole book Key keeps on ridiculing Lara and she takes without a fight. Even after Key learns the truth he still doesn't apologies to Lara, not even once. I wish in the end Key would have done something or said something to show that he really did love Lara but nothing happens. The end made me wish there was an epilogue to this story and I want to see how things turn between Key and Lara, like if they had a kid or something"
3,Crude Texas Family and Oily Writing,"Read the review entitled ""Smoke Okey-Doke"" below. It will save you time reading the book itself, which is blah entertainment.I guess it's a romance, but not really.I liked Brown's ""Fat Tuesday"" better than this one. These are the only two I've read by Sandra Brown to date."
4,Great Read,"I liked this book, like most of Sandra Brown's books. It was heart breaking that Dr. Mallory had to take so much verbal abuse, among other things. You'll cry to hear what she has been through. I enjoyed reading about each character in this book. It's hard to not pity Jody in the end. It's a great read."
5,Love it!,"I love this lotion, it's the second time I've purchased it. I've usually moved on when I get to the end of most perfumed lotions - but I still love this. I have the bath gel also."
3,A little strong for me but smells good.,"I prefer Amazing Grace and Pure Grace over the scent Falling in Love. The scent has a sweet blueberry smell covered up by a heavier, stronger scent. This scent has been around a while. Lots of people love it...I prefer a lighter, subtle scent."
1,Philosophy Falling In Love,"This fragrance is wonderful, however for the hefty price, it doesn't stay with you very long at all. I expected a lotion that would make your skin feel soft and pampered, but my skin felt dry again in minutes. A bit disappointing."
2,rebecca,i loved the book all the books i. the series r good the book was in great condition am a little dissapounted the picture on amazon did not meet up with rhe product if i new the book wad overly large and hard to jold i woulsbt of orded ir
5,A Fabulous Story in an Amazing Series!!,"I fell in love with Anya Bast's vampires in the first book of this series (Blood of the Rose) and BLOOD OF THE RAVEN is just as thrilling and sexy as the first book, if not more. Gabriel has been a favorite of mine since the first story and I was so excited to finally have his story in my hands. Gabriel is a wonderful hero, all things sexy and alpha, and Fate is the perfect heroine for him. The sparks really fly between them and their scenes together are meltingly hot. The Vampir world that Ms. Bast has created is so intriquing that it's impossible to put these stories down. Ms. Bast is an amazing storyteller and I can't wait to read the next installments in this fabulous series. Full of danger, intrigue, and sexy encounters, BLOOD OF THE RAVEN, and this whole series, is a must read for vampire fans."
3,sorta ok sometimes,eh.. Decent books but tend to be weak in my view. They have some killer ideas but at the same time seem to get lost and opt not to take these books to a level higher than just run of the mill fantasy.
3,A disappointment as far as Death Gate goes.,"I thought that Fire Sea was a good book, but I didn't like most of the characters, except for Haplo and Alfred. I also thought it was too morbid; the word 'Death' was used at least once on every page. The other aspects of the book were good, what I expected from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. Some important things happened in this book that were carried on into the last ones in the Series, but otherwise it wasn't too enjoyable to read. There was a lot of action, but in order to enjoy this book, you have to like dark atmospheres."
3,Extended versions,"The Strikers made their mark with two songs and their extended versions set something of a bench march,Their songs were hits especially in Cape Town. I was introduced to their music by a good DJ friend of mine in Cape Town, call ""Dr Boogie"". This song will still be relevant there today.If you want to go back to the real disco feel get this one."
5,lExcellent!,"Super idée d'avoir réuni sur ce CD les versions 12"" des Strikers. La version de Body Music sur plus de 11 minutes est une tuerie. Mon titre préféré reste Bring Out The Devil qui aurait mérité une version maxi 45T à l'époque. Strike It Up, Contagious et les multiples mixes de Inch By Inch sont la cerise de ce gteau très funk!Great Band, amazing tunes, So Funk!"
4,These are great!!!,"My dog loves these things!!!He is a small dog and the figure eight chews are his favorite. We have tried different chews, mostly the sticks. He didn't like them.He always comes running when he hears us opening up a package."
3,Only an okay dog chew,"I bought these for my dogs in addition to the bully sticks as something a little different, and they chew through these in just seconds (I have labs). The bully sticks are a far better value for the money."
2,Little liftoff,"2 1/2If your in the mood for Italian adult contemporary this might feign cultured interest, but intelligent songwriting is merely hinted at between easygoing accessabilities."
1,How many typos can one book have?,Very informative book on a novice level. However the typos make the author look like an idiot. Think they could reprint this without the typos?
1,George Shearing? Not.,The title is wrong. George Shearing is not on this CD. The user who added this should really correct it.
5,great,"im in afghanistan and got his in 8 days, faster than i thought. great video quality and love it thanks"
2,It worked while it lasted,"I had this product for about a week. In that week it kept my pipes from freezing on both days that it was cold enough. After that however, I came home to find frozen pipes. I went to check out the situation and found that the heating cable had burned up. There were bare wires hanging about with no insulation. I unplugged it and tossed it in the garbage. I don't want this sort of thing burning my house down."
2,Again.. specs needed,"Is that -380 C or -380 F? I've been looking for a good, economical solution to thermal management issues on my hydrogen fuel lines for those 'near' absolute zero nights in deep space. If it's -380 F, this obviously won't cut it!"
5,Fire Hazard if Installed Improperly!,"Heat tape is a great way to keep your pipes from freezing. It also provides a fast way to burn your house down if you install it improperly. Consumers frequently install the heat tape and then wrap the pipe in fiberglass insulation, which is fine, PROVIDED it doesn't have a paper or cardboard backing. You wouldn't wrap a 60W light bulb in paper backed glass, would you? Use unbacked fiberglass. Don't create hot spots by spiral wrapping the tape. Follow the directions -- buy several rolls of electrical tape to mount it, not duct tape, which often debonds when heated. Grounded, thermostatically controlled heat tape is a lot safer than the old, 2-wire stuff. Install it correctly and you'll avoid frozen pipes AND a visit from the fire department."
5,great product,"As an electrician have put in thousands of feet of this stuff,but for home use,this matches up with the best of them"
3,Specifications,"Be advised that the specification literature for this product does not specifically state that the ""thermostat"" is non-adjustable, and does not state at what ambient temperature the thermostat opens the electrical circuit that energizes the heat tape (creating heat). Additionally, the specifications do not state the maximum temperature that the heat tape emits when energized."
5,Does the job well,I used this to keep my RV fresh water hose from freezing while on a trip in cold country. Temps got into the mid 20s and the water kept running. Love it.
3,Haven't used,"I installed it and tested it. But, we have not had a very cold winter. So I have even had to use it yet. I am confident that it should work. Maybe next winter."
4,Eyes of Fire - Excellent Reading,I really enjoyed this book. It had many facts that were useful in my study of the beautiful jaguars of South America. The northern Territory has many facinating aspects to it and the jaguars are certainly the most interesting. If you are interested in these amazing creates this book is at must read... or at least a must skim.
5,Great Photos,This is a fun book to read as well as to enjoy the unique photos of the first live jaguar ever photographed in Arizona. The Glenn family has done much for conservation in southeastern Arizona and some of the proceeds from the sale of this book go to ths cause.
5,brilliant,"the french kicks seem to have taken an easy left turn from their previous releases and, to their credit, have managed to cross several genres while maintaining certain themes such as richly layered sounds and clever vocal interplays. smooth as butter, this album will leave you dancing and loving and laughing and crying all at once. to listen to this album is to love it - good luck trying to take it off of the stereo."
5,French Kicks Ass,"I hate comparing bands or describing what they sound like. It bugs me becuase every other band sounds like Pink Floyd or The Cure. If you like formulaic sub-pop indie rock with lots of piano then you will like this album. I saw them in DC last weekend and they are very tight live. Excellent show. The dude with the spotlight review was pretty much right. This is very controlled and restrained rock. Very catchy and very hip. Hipsters love these NY boys. I disagree with that spotlight review becuse One Time Bells was very mellow as well. I dont know which one I like more but I'm leaning toward the last one. Nontheless, buy this album, it will make you happy and it will probably make you sing along, just do it alone. These vocals arent for amateurs. I know, from experience."
2,"winy, repetitive","I gave them an honest listen and came away feeling like I drank something too surgary-sweet like orange juice concentrate. Too winy, pop-like. yeck."
3,Placebo?,"They feel great in long hours of work and study, but since I have two monitors, my eyes are constantly moving and I no longer feel so tired, I can't tell anymore if there's a difference with or without them. Both monitors are flat screen, and I usually have the brightness set to 50%."
3,Colle system a mess?,"Well if he is going to trash the Colle system, he did not tell us why it is so bad, to say that ""that the players know nothing of chess"" is not good enough. It might have been better to say that it is not played at the highest levels, but this still is not a good explanation. What he did not say was that any other opening will have much more variations to keep in mind. The Colle system is easy to learn and will take you to a playable middle game."
5,"Essential Book! Proof Einstein, etc. were spiritual men.","I am replacing a lost copy of this book. It is essential in my library. People believe the great physicists were atheists. This book will completely dispell that notion. They shared a view of Ultimate Reality (God, if you feel comfortable with that word) that is very consistant with the Eastern, yogic idea that U.R. can be known through direct experience and that all that is is a manifestation of That. If your friends tell you mysticism is a fairy tail, whip out a copy of this book. When they find that Einstein, Plank, Heisenburg, etc. even based their discoveries on it, they will have to eat their words!"
5,brought clarity to my internal debate,"Any book that can end, by the introduction, an internal debate that has raged for years in my own mind all the while providing an entirely new perspective on some of the most brilliant minds of modern times deserves the highest mark.I have struggled for years to come to terms with the balance of physics and mysticism. The Tao of Physics and such never really rung completely true for me, and I had resided myself to accepting that perhaps someday physics would explain my experiences.This book brings so much clarity to my perspective on this matter and how they are traveling in two different directions. The critical reviews either sought something different or completely misunderstood the book (if they read it at all).I can't get over how mystical our most brilliant scientists were. I suddenly don't feel so alone ... or insane."
4,Easy reading,"This books simply show's that physics ""the hardest and most objective of the sciences"", and it's greatest thinkers, Ultimately have no way to say they are being objective. So they become somewhat mystical in there thinking...when they return to the world of chairs and tables to try and make sense of their findings. The book does not shed much light if any on the somwhat mystical nature at the very essence of our material reality as uncovered by quantum physics. It seems more to focus on what these physisists as human beings are left to deal with. The book is grounded in that manner. It doesn't run on in imagination with the wide open playing field of quantum theory. It is a book that does deal with the taboo of equating the quantum world with our macroscopic world. Many book's out there do this in very convaluted ways, this book has more of a focus to it but is a little dry and a bit too truncated with the text of these thinkers and their thoughts/conclustions."
5,Loved it!!!!,Blackfunk II picked up right where blackfunk left off without skipping a beat. It was one of the best books I have ever read because there is truth to it. You have to read black funk first to get into it and once you do you are not gonna wanna put it down. I am anixously waiting on Blackfunk III!!!!!
4,Black Funk ll,"This is a fast read. Hard to put down. The topic, The story and the characters will entice you. This book is a blaze! Not only is it erotic, suspenseful and thought provoking, It makes you feel the story, the characters and their lives from one minute to the next. So we wait for Black Funk lll..Dawn~MBC"
2,Blackfunk? More like Blackf-ck!,"This novel is a joke. Who likes this garbage anyway? I read it twice, then had two of my friends read it and we all agree that it is a big waste of time. Also, books should not have numbers in the title like Rocky or Psycho, it gives them a dumbed down feel of uneducated literature. Also, why is everyone in the book black sounding?"
3,IS THIS FOR REAL???????????????????????????????????????????,The title is what made me buy these books! I am currently waiting on #3! These are fast reads and you get hooked because you're sitting there like is this for real? I read both books in 2 days and the main complaint was the editing so let's hope that it doesn't show in 3.
5,BETTER THE SECOND TIME AROUND,"FOR ALL OF YOU WHO READ BLACKFUNK PART ONEPLEASE RUN OUT THERE AND GET PART TWOTHIS BOOK IS OFF THE HOOK, ALL I'M GOING TOSAY IS; THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT YOU WILL NOTKNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT LIKE MOST BOOKSIT TAKES OFF JUST WHERE PART ONE LEFT OFF. THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK WILL HAVE YOU IN TOTAL SHOCK."
1,What the hell is this mess?,"Since I'm a huge disco fan, I was excited when I found this collection by Indeep, because I'd never heard anything other than their one big hit ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"". Well, after listening, I could still probably say that that's all I've heard from them. EVERY song has the same guitar riff with a note or two slightly changed, and weak, uninspired singing that, in each case, seems to be patterned after that one song. And what exactly was the point of including 10-second snippets of meaningless noises like a toilet flushing and tires screeching. Avoid this and just find a disco collection that has the 1 song. There are lots of them out there."
3,Was here and alive in the 80s,"Anyone who wasn't here in the 80's can't appreciate this collection. Which is why some county boy can't hear what's there. The artists aren't trying to croon, but have a bit of fun with some funky base licks. The best part of the collection is it's innocence in lyrics and musical drive. Simply close your eyes and dance or listen to the lyrics and laugh. SC boy stick with Bobby Womack, which also is a great artist for what he sings. Keep it all in prospective."
3,very good product but does not accomodiate as many sport coats as indicated,great quality... its a little tight for the number of sport coat it says it will accomodate.... with out wrinkling 2 full suites are fine.. 3 begins to wrinkle medium weight sport coats with slacks shirts and shoes...3 light weight coats should be fine...
1,"Absolute trash, not worth a penny","I needed a bag for traveling with suits and this bag is fantastic. It is not that expensive, it has compartments for everything and easily holds hangers.I wasn't expecting much out of it, but it has been great - very solid too.EDIT:I wrote my review prior to actually ever using it on a trip.It never survived even one trip - it's ""heavy duty"" zipper that holds it together is absolute trash and broke the first time it was used (not under a high load, just fails to close).Makes the entire bag, no matter how nice the rest of it is, absolute worthless trash - it won't close, therefore useless.I will never buy a product by this company again, it is worthless trash. If I could rate it lower, I would."
4,Great Garment Bag!,Very nice - classy bag. I like that it has a spot for whatever I need to take. A place for the shoes is always nice... the only thing is I always take to much and have a hard time closing the bag.
4,Great machine,"I love how small this machine is, and it really does work up a good sweat. I love that my low back doesn't hurt, neither does my knees- unlike when I used a treadmill or stair stepper. The only disappointment is that in the commercials they do not tell you that you have to be almost running to achieve the results they promise. It is a great workout though, and I am always telling friends about how much I love it."
5,Great Workout,"I was surprised that the TC3000 is actually a tread climber, tread mill and a stepper! I had not read that in the material provided in the brief description. In fact, the combination of the three gives a terrific workout even for someone who has not stepped on a machine in a long time. After two weeks my knees and feet don't hurt as much and I am starting to see results. Combined with a good diet and other strengthening exercises, this is the ONE workout that works. I love it!"
2,Too costly,This is an over rated piece of equipment. Contacting Bowflex is a waste of time at least a 25 minute wait to talk with a customer service rep and this was supposed to be a good item why am I finding myself calling them once a week to complain. They really did not want to take the item back for return. So it sits. I'm a petite person and the treadills are to small and close together and the hydraulics - rarely moves the treadills up and down. All around a costly piece of a dust collector. Give me shoes and the sidewalk.
1,Beware! Expensive Piece of Junk,"Thankfuly, we bought this machine through Amazon, and they have given us wonderful customer service so we're not out nearly 2 grand!This machine does not work properly. We were never able to make the treadles go up and down more that a few inches. Regardless of the setting and regardless of the size of the person using it. Sent the first one back - received the 2nd and it worked exactly the same!!Unfortunately for Bowflex, they provide you with an instructional DVD. Unfortunate, in that it is obvious that the machine sitting in your home does not work like the one on the DVD. Not even close!!Please do not waste your money! We called Bowflex to get some customer support (if that's what you want to call it) and really, I think they're aware that this is a cheap product. If even 1/2 the people that order this peice of junk keep it, Bowflex still makes a fortune!Not only does it not work, but it makes a tremendous amount of noise....not working. Buyer beware!!"
1,Beware - Support Sucks,"Unless you think you can troubleshoot and support this machine yourself think twice before buying this product. Not sure if is a good machine, I never got to find out. I purchased and TC3000 and my nightmare began. It was delivered in 3- 70lb boxes...after several hours of assembly it wouldn't work. I called the tech support number in their ridiculous assembly manual (the salesperson said they would help you with any questions you might have anytime). Long story short, I had that 200 lb, $2000.00 paperweight in my living room for a week. Total tally came to 18 phone calls, 4.5 hours on hold, 2 emails and 5 messages left before I ever got to talk to someone. Customer service and tech support are non-existent. Bowflex/Nautilus is happy to take your money but obviously can't be bothered to take your calls or stand behind their product. I'll never do business with them again."
1,taking my time to write this for others to be aware,"I bought the treadclimber 3000 for my wife. It is not as good as you all may think. The installation was ridiculous,they should have put it together more before the shipment. As for the shocks i have 3 pairs all with cracked tops so you cannot even adjust the resistance. I received 2 replacements from bowflex which both came damaged.I noticed there is no stopper on the adjustment so if you continue to turn it past the 12 and go to a lower # it will throw it completely off.It is definitly not a proffesional unit as in a gym for this kind of $.My advise to you all is buy what you use and see for yourself in a gym which is used constantly.This machine looks as if it wont last for 6 months."
5,It worked for the Marine,"I am 28, and I had three knee surgeries while I've been in the Marine Corps. I bought this machine to help me lose the weight I had gained whle I was hurt, and also to provide me with a workout that wouldn't kill my knees. THIS MACHINE WORKS. I went from weighiing 220 lbs to weighing 150 lbs within 4 months. This machine will give you a workout! I hate going to the gym. I like the fact that I can walk to my garage and get a better workout than I do at the gym. It works your entire legs, your core, everything. With the results I achieved with this machine, I'll never use anything else. I'd rather fork out the money for this machine than have to pay for agym membership and the gas it would take to get me there. Believe me, take it from the Marine, if you use this machine, DILIGENTLY, it will pay for itself."
1,Review of the commercial,"This is actually a review of the commercial and not the product. Product may work for all I know or care. Walking is walking. Matters not if you use a stupid machine or not. Matters even less if it it one of these, a treadmill, an eliptical, a stepper, or whatever. You commercial is stupid, plain and simple. One of the stupidest points is when you have your actor talk about what enters room first, his stomach or his chest. It's. neither. Unless he is deformed in someway it's his feet that enter first. Your commercial (I suppose) has done it's job in that I will remember it. I just would never buy your product. It is irritatingly stupid and one of those that makes me want to throw something at the television. I hope it goes away soon."
1,horrible!,"This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned! (and I have owned quite a few) Right out of the box it failed to pick up even the littlest crumbs on my floor. It took me almost an hour to clean my rather small floor, and when I was done I wanted to chuck it out the window. Terrible, terrible horrible vacuum!"
1,this vacuum sucks- and not in a good way,"I have a 14 month old baby. She leaves cracker crumbs on the floor, and likes to crumble things... whatever they may be. I got this vacuum for mother's day and it has sucked ever since. It doesn't pick up the crumbs, and, in fact, spits them back out at my feet. The vacuum smells. The filters and hoses clog so much and so often that dirt and dust doesn't even reach the canister. Even at the appropriate carpet height settings, the vacuum clogs with carpet and after a shake to get it working again, leaves a large hairball of carpet fiber and dirt at my feet. I hate this vacuum."
1,Piece of Junk,"Eureka should be ashamed to put its name on this. It literally fell apart. Too heavy. Short hose. Have to unjam it 3 or four times per use. Please don't buy this. Amazon, if you love us, please don't sell these."
1,Terrible product-please don't waste your $$ like I did,I wish I had read reviews on this vacuum before wasting my money. I've had the vacuum for less than 2 years (of course past the warranty) and now it's sparking when I use it. Customer service was no help at all and now I'm stuck w/ a fire hazard and a piece of junk! I will never buy another Eureka vacuum.
1,"Started off great, but worthless now.",I have owned this vacuum a year and after about 6 months it started to loose suction even if I cleaned the filters which you have to do all the time. I have owned dust busters with more suction. This has to be the worst vacuum I have ever owned. Save your money and buy something else. Mine is headed for the landfill as I feel bad selling it on a garage sale in case it is to some one I know. I personally give it zero stars but that is not an option.
4,Good Product,"We have a cat, a dog -Lab puppy, and yes a lot of hair issues. This vacuum blew us away on how well it cleaned the carpets. We wondered what our old vacuum was picking up because it sure didn't look like it picked up anything compared to this vacuum.Also, we bought this vacuum because of the extra attachment for the furniture that contains its own agitator. This attachment worked great, and removed all the pet hair like it did on the carpets. Our rugs got a great cleaning as well.If you want something that is powerful, cleans well or in one pass of the vacuum, something to clean the pet hair from your furniture, then this is the vacuum you want. Spend the little cash on this vacuum just to humor yourself by seeing what your old vacuum left behind.Pros: power, attachment, edge extension, washable parts/filters, dust free vacuumCons: very heavy, hose attachment needs to be longer, the duster is interesting, not the best on bare floors."
4,"Works Great , Great value for money","I bought this vacuum only yestreday. I am very happy with this vacuum. I vaccumed my 15 x 15 carpet and collected lots of dark colored dust in the canester. Only catch is you will have to empty the canester EVERY TIME, may be also FILTER. But I think its ok when you compare it to the perpormance.Also it is not good for floors. But over all it does a great job."
1,Terrible vacuum,"This vacuum is garbage. It has terrible suction and your feet get ""sand"" blasted as you walk behind it. The filter clogs up very quickly and the rubber band that turns everything wears out quickly. I wish I would have read the reviews before I wasted my money."
1,One year in...ours is on the street for the trash man,this is literally one of the worst products i've ever purchased. Clogs easily and has smelled like burning rubber since the day we first used it. TERRIBLE.
1,Not even worth 1 star!!!!!,"Eureka, 2971BVZ Altima Bag less Upright Vacuum has to be the worst vacuum I have ever had. It worked well the first couple of times I used it, but every time I turned it on it smelled as if it was going to burst into flames. It makes such a mess when you empty it; It spits dirt crumbs ECT out of the back when you try to vacuum any surface. When I get it out of the closet, it leaves a pile of dirt that was not sucked up, as another writer said. Having two kids and a dog I vacuum often and this actually makes my job harder. The roller brush has broken on this and even though it is less than a year old, I cannot find a replacement. I just hope that my husband lets me buy a new one , my housework is taking way to long and I would rather not set my house on fire with this worthless piece of &@#!!."
1,The worst,"I usually read reviews here so I hope I can help someone else. This is by far the worst vacuum I have ever owned. I have two dogs and a cat and the filter clogged within one minute (really) of start up. The dirt cup is small and it shoots dirt out on bare floors. I could not get the hose to work and therefore could not get the 'tiger paw' to work either. I now will not suck since I had to clean up a chocolate powder spill. I cleaned the filters out with water and compressed air and still nothing. I tried to return it to the store but since it was used, same item only. I have written Eureka demanding a full refund. I will let you know how that works out."
1,It broke in 3 months,This vacuum is no good. It broke in three months and it never worked very well from the first day. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Eureka Altima the worst vacuum I ever owned!,Beware! This only looks like a vacuum. Mine is three months old and tonight I threw it in the trash. You are honestly better off with a broom and dustpan on the carpet. The filter system on this vacuum should win WORLDS WORST DESIGN award. I take two steps down my hallway and have to shut down the vacum and clean this little sponge filter because it can't handle anything. I just spent about one hour trying to vacuum the hallway. I had to dismantle the hose system because I accidently vacuumed up a leaf. It clogged the whole works. One little leaf. I'm sure there is much dirt and dust left in my carpet from the past three months. I contacted Eureka when this was only one month old and they told me to send it in for repair. It just never worked. Don't waste your money. I will never buy Eureka again.
1,Read reviews before you buy!,"I bought this 4 years ago and still have it only because I use it only once week on one 10x12 rug. The first belt broke within 4 months and broke the spring on the roller with it. It does a fair job on the rug, but from day one, it has made my living room smell like nasty burnt motor oil after every use. It does NOT work on bare floors and I absolutely CAN'T BELIEVE they have the nerve to say: 'The motorized brush lets you go from carpet-to bare floor-cleaning with the flick of a switch.' Go to bare floor and you will have flying dirt everywhere!!! I bought it because it was INEXPENSIVE, but as it turned out, it was CHEAP. Taught me a lesson, read reviews before you buy!!"
1,really really bad!!!,"there are 134 reviews most of which are poor but, I am just so mad that I had to leave a comment. Do not buy this sweeper!! I can't even tell you how many times the hose has come undone why I was vacuuming only to find the entire time I was vacuuming I was throwing dirt all over the room!!!!I'm so mad that I didn't do my homework before I bought it!!!"
2,Dissapointed,"My husband brought this home & I thought anything would be better than our 30 year-old hoover. It does pick up a lot more, but I have to clean the filters out every time I use it. (one long haired cat) The attatchments do have a tendancy to fall off also & the powerpaw is worthless."
4,Good all around vacuum,"It does its job very well. It cleans the carpet thoroughly and without expelling anything back into the air. I found the dirt cup easy to empty as well. It is a little heavy however, and the duster doesn't attach very securely. For the price though its a great value and i'm glad i purchased it."
2,Disappointed,"We purchased this vacuum after reading good reviews, only to bring it home and have it fail to meet expectations. We had to replace a Hoover Windtunnel that finnaly called it quits after 7 years. The Eureka seemed like an adequate replacement, but it just doesn't get the job done. It seems to just move the dirt around instead of actually picking it up. It can barely handle anything larger than a small dust-bunny. This vacuum just doesn't cut it. Our Dustbuster does a much better job, at least we got it on sale for less than $80, but I would rather have my $80 back."
1,HIGH FAILURE RATE!,"Seriously, read all the reviews. This vacuum has a seriously high failure rate for the same exact problem. Mine lasted eight minutes, yes eight minutes before the bearing on the left side went bad, over heated, melted the plastic around it, the holder, stopped the beater brush from rotating and the belt stopped and started to smell. It worked absolutely flawless.... for seven minutes and 59 seconds."
3,Fair performance,"I wanted a new vaccuum because my old one was heavy and had a short on board hose. Well guess what , now I have another heavy vaccuum with a short hose. I read negative reviews about this product before I purchased it but decided to ignore them and purchase it because the features looked impressive. It is a powerful vaccum for the money but the spinning duster only ""spun"" maybe twice so I just clean it the old fashioned way with the hose. I purchased the only extension hose that Eureka makes and it is so long there is very little suction so I just deal with the ""too-short"" hose. I suggest Eureka skip the duster on their next model and go for the longer hose if you want to impress me!!! I did give this product three stars though for cleaning ability."
1,Worthless,I recently bought an Altima Model 2981BVZ. This vacuum is the most flawed piece of machinery I have ever had the misfortune of using. Every 3 minutes I have to clean the foam filter. I clean more out of the foam filter than I do out of the dust cup. The hose attachments have very little power. I am sadly disappointed in the quality.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"This vacuum worked for the first month then lost almost all suction! If you pull the hose out & try to vacuum the baseboards or anything it does not suck it up. Yet if you put your hand on it it will suck your hand. It sprays anything hard all over the place & I have even seen dust spraying out the front when I vacuum in front of the window. I tried vacuuming capture up which is a powder that cleans carpet, It would not even clean that up it just sprayed it out the front of the vacuum all over the place!!! I had to use a shop vac to clean it up! I cannot believe they can sell this piece of you know what!!! I have owned it for less then a year, total waste of money!!!"
2,"Good suction, poor design.","The vacuum has good suction and the brush attachment works great.The filter cover barley hangs on and if you bump it, it falls off easily. When the canister is about half full dirt starts to build up in the path from the filter and the filter gets giant wads of dirt on it also. The spin duster does not really spin that great, nor does it pick up much dust.Overall I was disappointed by this product and will more than likely be returning it to the store i bought it from"
1,Since I HAVE to give it a star. One.,"The absolute worst vacuum cleaner you could own. Period. After three weeks it's spitting dirt out the back onto my toes. The sweeper doesn't pick up ANYTHING, not even tissue paper. Hair tangles around the roller, which still spins, but that's the only thing it'll take off the floor, unless you use the ""power paw"" for your carpet, which is still sub-standard. The filters get clogged and nasty after 3 minutes. THREE MINUTES!!! You can get about 1/3 of your room done before you have to clean a filter. Good luck.DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM CLEANER!!! THEY SHOULD BE PAYING YOU TO TAKE IT OFF OF THEIR HANDS!!!"
1,Deserves ZERO stars!,"If you have animal hair in your house and/or if you have a combination of hardwood/tile floors & rugs, DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM! This is the WORST vacuum I've ever used in my life. I've never been so frustrated trying to clean my house. As if house cleaning isn't a crappy enough job, then to have to go over the same spot on the carpet a hundred times in every direction imaginable and STILL not be able to get the hair up! I've taken every part that comes off, off to check for clogs and there are none. This vacuum just doesn't suck! I'd get the hair & debris up quicker, picking it off with my fingers, piece by piece.I've only ever owned Eureka vacuums all my life. Always the old uprights and they were fantastic! Apparently, this is what happens when you ship your operations overseas."
2,1 1/2 stars,"I've had mine for 5 1/2 years & it still works & that is good. However it always did a really poor job at cleaning.I believe it is the whole bagless technology, after doing a little research on the web. It throws out a lot of particles at your feet as you use it. When stuff isn't hitting your feet, its time to see if its clogged up somewhere. The most popular clogging point is the plastic cone filter inside and above the canister, and/or the tunnel leading to it. One also has to deal with the main filter & its foam sub filter, and the HEPA filter.The whole operation is a dirty mess, from dumping the canister contents into the trash to cleaning the filters all of the time, to walking on a dirty floot that you just vacuumed.I will never buy a bagless vac. (unless some sort of shop vac. type thing maybe)."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ ALL OF THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING. I HAVE HAD TROUBLE FROM DAY ONE. SHOOTS OUT DIRT - PET HAIR [ I HAVE LOTS ] GETS CLOGGED IN THE FILTER. I HAVE TO ""PICK"" OUT THE HAIR ETC FROM THE HOSE - IT NEVER MAKES IT TO THE LITTLE CUP. WHEN EMPTYING THE CUP - DIRT GOES EVERYWHERE. MUST SHOWER AFTER EVERY VACUUMING EXPERIENCE!"
1,Piece of Garbage,"I have had this vacuum for less than one month and I'm already fighting urges to chuck it in the dumpster. The dust cup is as easy to remove as they advertise, but it still dumps dust everywhere when removed. Changing the small plastic filter above the dirt cup is also pretty much akin to just reaching into the dirt cup while it's full and fishing around. Recently, I noticed it was spitting a cloud of dust while vacuuming and leaving dust marks on my dark blue carpet. I promptly took everything off that is cleanable... cleaned all the filters, the brush roller, the dust cup... allowed everything to dry thoroughly... and then attempted to vacuum up the dust marks it left hours before. Garbage. Within a minute, all of the filters were white and clogged again, and the dust marks remain. And don't get me started on how this thing spits dirt around on bare floors.... Save your money!"
4,Best Value,"I bought this at Walmart in Canada while on sale and it is about $78 after tax to replace my old trusty Fantom Fury which the motor died. I didn't expect much since it is about half the price of the Fantom but to my surprise it is almost as good and I agree with the above reviewer if only it can do better on bare floor, I'll give it a 5. BTW, its performance on bare floor is not worse than the Fantom Fury but most upright don't do bare floor well except may be the very expensive ones."
5,Can't believe my house was this dirty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I vacuum at least every other day. I have been very pleased with my Hoover (so I thought). I just purchased the Eureka yesterday and ""OH MY GOSH"", I can't stop vacuuming! It is picking up so much cat and dog hair and dust and dirt. Where as some reviews complain of cleaning the filter and cannister too much, it is a small price to pay when you actually are able to see what your old cleaner was missing. I do agree however that the filter system should be a little better designed so that it doesn't clog so quickly, but for the money ""THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE INVESTMENT!"
1,Yikes!,"I've had this for 2 months. In the beginning, it worked great! Picked up all sorts of things, and it was really easy to use. Fast forward to today and it basically caught on fire. Started smoking, making weird noises, shaking, and the smell....oh the smell. It is going to take weeks of the burning rubber smell to get out of my home. Buyer beware!"
1,"Save your money, don't buy this vacuum","This vacuum always smokes, and after just one year it is smoking so bad that we are going to replace it. It clogs easily even though I have regularly maintained it. Get something different."
1,My Vacuum Sucks! NOT!,"And with the other poor reviews, I add my own. Mine did last longer than a month. But, just so you know, it takes about 10 months to completely fall to pieces.Now, if you have a 500 sq. ft. efficiency apartment, this is THE perfect vacuum for you. But, a normal size house? This baby can't handle it. Especially if it's carpeted.I'm ashamed that I replaced my Kirby with this."
4,Pretty good vacuum,"As far as regular vacuuming I definitely can't complain. The first time I vacuumed with it I completely filled up the dust cup. (I have three dogs and a cat so we have a lot to clean up) I was very pleased with how easy the dust cup was to remove and empty. The vacuum seems to have very extensive filtration which is a must with pets. My only gripe is that the hose and so called ""power claw"" just doesn't seem to have much suction at all. I think I may take it back and exchange it because nobody else has mentioned that problem; maybe mine is faulty."
1,HORRIBLE - NOT EVEN USEFUL AFTER CARPET WAS PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED!,"I have never written a negative review before, but am so frustrated with this product, I can't help it. I'm sure the other negative reviews will already prevent anyone checking this from purchasing one, but I wanted to add one more. Today I vacuumed two rooms and a set of stairs that had just been professionally cleaned, and the thing still clogged. I used to think it was my fault - that I should vacuum more often or that we had too many pets, but two rooms and a set of stairs that had just been cleaned was too much for this horrible machine. This machine works well if you enjoy spending 15 minutes after each room figuring out where the latest problem is. There should be a class-action suit against Eureka for this completely useless appliance. Their engineers should be ashamed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!! WAST OF MONEY!!!!!,"This is the WORST vacuum ever made!! I have gone through 2 of them since August 2006. Both started out OK in the very first week, but then after a while very poor suction, very poor!! Also, both vacuums have started smoking as soon as you turn the vacuum on...the first one did this 2 months after I bought it, and the second one (not my choice) started doing it in March. The roller is completely shot, burnt the whole inside!! I will never buy from Eureka again, Customer service was not helpful, nor did they really seem concerned that I've gone through 2 of these vacuums in less than 8 months! They told me to bring it back to the store, but Target as a 90 day return policy-also, when I had to return the first vacuum Target would only let me exchange it for the same one, now I'm stuck with the second one with the same problems...don't buy a vacuum from Target either!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM,"I borrowed this vacuum from my nephew and his wife when my 30 year old electrolux needed a new hose. When I borrowed it they had only had it a couple of months. It is the worst vacuum I have ever used!!!! I have bare floors, so I noticed right away that what the vacuum was picking up in the front was being left scattered behind it!!! It was the biggest mess I had ever seen. I gave up after 10 minutes, and got out the old broom and swept the house, and ordered the new hose for my 30 year old electrolux. I don't know what Eureka is in the business of making, but it sure isn't vacuum cleaners!!!!"
2,Only for LITE vacuuming,"I purchsed this vacuum for the attachments and have tested all of them out. (We have 3 cats at home.) The vacuum itself performs fairly well - if the dust cups are empty. However, they must be emptied EVERY time you use the vacuumn, including the top filter (very annoying). The attachments fall off and the worst thing is the hose. It has very little suction, even with all cups emptied. Not enough suction to make the power paw attachment spin (worthless). It had a hard time picking up cat litter or any fine particles on the floor. (My old dirt devil could pick that up even when full.) At best, only marginal performance -- I will be buying another new vacuum soon because this one isn't cutting it. Good for only LITE vacuuming jobs -- my $25 Swiffer picks up more stuff."
1,doesn't deserve any stars,Worst vacuum i have owned. after 2 months the brush system would not spin unless it was on the highest setting. Lower it and it stops on contact with carpet. Eureka needs to fire their design engineers. A monkey could build a better vacuum
1,Useless...buy something else.,"I had an experience similar to that of some of the other reviewers. The vacuum cleaner started OK but went downhill quickly. I emptied the dirt cup and cleaned the filter frequently, but it stopped picking up pet hair soon after the first use. I've had it about 4 months and, like the other reviewers' machines, the belt has broken. The store I bought it from doesn't carry the belts. Neither does Target, who also sells this vacuum cleaner. Now I either have to hunt down a belt or pop it back in the box and take it back to the store. Glad I kept the receipt."
2,The only good part is that is sucks.,"Eureka needs to fire the first week intern who designed this vacuum. The power is great; it vacuumed really well, and I didnt mind emptying the compartment as much as some other reviewers. However, the attacments are all useless, and dont stay connected to the vacuum AT ALL. There is a design flaw with the hieght adjuster. It does notghing. The piece that is supposed to adjust it doesnt even make contact with the dial, because the design is backwards. The one thing that sent me over the edge, though, is when it stopped standing up on its own. This was on the 6th or 7th time I ever used it. My next action is to see if I can take it back, which I do regret a bit because it really did vacuum well."
2,Filters are a Pain!!!,"My in-laws bought this for us and it is the first vacuum I've owned that had filters in it. The dust cup fills up so fast, I have to empty it several times each use (and my house is not dirty). If I don't empty it right away, the dirt and carpet fibers back up into the foam filter area and the the whole thing gets clogged. It makes a huge mess when I try to empty the dust cup. So far it still works, it's just a pain. I will save my money and buy a Dyson next time (and no, I don't sell them). I wish I could go back to my old vaccuum. It never had a filter, just a vacuum bag and I had it seven years with no problems. Oh, the good old days when we didn't care about dust in the air! By the way, this was on sale for $70 at Target."
2,"Too much work, not enough results","I, too, had high hopes for this vacuum. After about 6 months of using this vacuum, I'm ready for something new! Ugh! We have a labrador and two small kids. I'm simply looking for a vacuum that will consistently clean the carpets and our hard floors without a lot of extra work. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have to pause every 2 minutes to dump the canister and mess around with the filters or it literally stops sucking up dirt. The hose is useless unless the filter is sparkling clean. I even purchased a second filter to swap during vacuuming so that I can save time and make vacuuming simpler. Although it helps, it just shouldn't be such high maintenance. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this vacuum."
1,This vacuum sucks..no pun intended!,"We have had this vacuum only a year andit worked well for about 3 months as someone else wrote. The filters get so clogged that even cleaning them doesn't help and we replaced one, couldn't find a replacement forthe other anywhere, and that still didn't help. The final straw was that it started spitting dirt back out and when I went to the closet to get it out to use it..there was a little pile of dirt right in front of it..like it was mocking me! I have paid the same amount for vacuums in the past that worked much better and lasted longer....you'd be better off ripping up your money than buying this sorry excuse for a vacuum! I just got the Hoover Wind Tunnel Bag canister vacuum yesterday and so far so good!"
1,Don't waiste your money. It's badly designed,"Like most user complains after a period of use, it's start kicking dirt around instead vacuuming. The unit develop a poor suction even with all the filter cleaned after each use.On the hard floor, the air pressure created by the brush unit is much stronger than the vacuum unit. The excess air will blow the lint and dirt away from the vacuum machine instead of collecting it.You might be better of using a broom."
1,this vacuum is awful,"Eureka 2996AVZ Altima Bagless Upright VacuumThis vacuum is so awful, I feel like throwing it out the window! It worked great exactly 2 times and after that the filters get gunky and the cups need to be emptied when only half full. I WASHED THE FILTERS AND DRIED THEM, EMPTIED THE CUP REGULARLY AND THE THING KICKS UP DUST AND CRUMBS THAT IT SHOULD BE SUCKING UP.DON'T BUY IT I'LL GIVE YOU MINE FOR FREE AND THEN YOU WON'T BE OUT THE $100.00 !! I'm looking for a vacuum with a bag , you know the old fashioned kind without filters and bells and whistles, the kind that actually works."
1,Yellow Submarine,"The little yellow submarine..this thing should be thrown off a pier & sink into oblivion. This vacuum SUCKS..and not in a good way. Yes, it's great for about the first day, but after about 4 times vacuuming my house & after what seems like hundereds of stops to clean out the extremely messy filters & cup (which seemed to leave as much dirt on the vacuum & carpet as was being picked up), the vacuum just decided to stop working: no belt problems, nothing clogged - it just stopped working. I've pulled the entire vacuum apart to try to find an answer, but there is none. Save your money & buy a good vacuum. This is not worth the pain."
3,Goodvacuum - a pain to empty,This vacuum picks up very well... until of course the filters get blocked and then you have to wash them out. Oh yes.. and after about 1 year of use the back wheel fell off - haven't been able to find replacement part to keep the wheel on. Gave up and just bought a Dyson Dc-17.
1,stay away from it,It breaks belts constantly. I just bought 2 belts yesterday and they are gone already! This was my 4th package of belts. I have this vacuum for about 2 years now.
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"If you like:replacing your BROKEN vacuum belt every time you vacuum,burnt rubber smell in your house,clogged filters at least once each time you vacuum,attachments that stop working after the first time you use them,terrible or NO SUCTIONthen you should buy this vacuum. Otherwise, stay far far away from this one!We have tried to make it work for a year now - faithfully cleaning filters, replacing belts, etc. and we just have to give up. I'm tired of having dirty carpet so we're buying something else.Pros: Cool tools that appealed to my husband & only worked once!Cons: heavy, belts constantly break, filters clog easily, shoots stuff back on hard floors, etc."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"Can I give this 0 stars?? When the motor on the first one started smoking and smelling I returned it for a new one, willing to give Eureka the benefit of the doubt and hoping that I just got a defective machine. However, the second one has been no better. The revolving brush for pet hair has stopped spinning, and the opening going into the dirt canister is constantly getting clogged with hair. The attachments never stay assembled while in use and I can literally feel the dirt being kicked out the back onto my feet. Then, as soon as the machine is turned off, dirt falls back out. I cannot wait to buy a different vacuum. This vacuum is a complete waste of time and money."
1,Worst Vacuum Ever,"I bought this vacuum about 3 months ago for what I thought was a great deal - originally $130, on sale and with coupon for $80. The first time I used it, the belt broke. How fortunate that it came with an extra. Against my better judgement, I didn't return it. I should've. The suction is LOUSY. It clogs with pet hair. There's not much I hate more than having to stick my hand up inside the vacuum and pull the dusty nastiness out by hand. I will admit, I have a rabbit, and I do end up vacuuming some hay, too, which does make it a bit more tricky, but I've been doing it for 9 years without clogging issues. Until now. And 1 bunny ball? Had to go over it multiple times before the vacuum would suck it up. So, unless all you have to vacuum is dust, this is not the vacuum for you. That said, I have just plopped down $130 for a new new vacuum. Argh."
4,In The Jaws of the Black Dogs,This book was very easy to follow and to understand. I am a fellow sufferer of depression and found the author's revelations very similar to my own feelings. I could easily identify with the anguish he felt and the devastation caused by the lack of understanding of this illness. It is nice to know that someone else in the world has experienced what I have been through. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recomment it to others who suffer similar afflictions.
2,"Okay, but not great.","I wasn't impressed with this book. There were definitely a few comments that really struck home, but they were few and far between."
5,mailbox and post combo,Our new mailbox and post was knocked down by a trailer and though it had to be stood up again it remained undamaged. It is pleasing to the eye and easy to install.
3,Disappointment with company,"I received the product on time and with the box great. When I opened the box I found the manufacturers box inside and in bad shape. The whole top had been retaped. On opening this box I found the mailbox bent out of shape and with dents on the post. Also no instruction sheet in the box. It was not woth the hassle to return, so I got intructions off the net, straightened the box and assembled the unit. Once assembled, mailbox is good. I personally think Solar Group pawned off a returned mailbox by shipping this to me in a second box. I wouldn't trust them."
1,unfinished product,"Most items that I order should not have holes in them.This item should have holes to insert the screws!! The manufacturer of this mailbox was ""un-hole-y""---- no holes for the screws. Yes. I probably could have drilled the holes myself- but when Ipay this much for a piece of plastic I expect a ""no-frustration"" assembly. I sent it back. TK"
1,You never knew anyone could fail to make a box. Until you see this.,"Amazon sent me this thing, and sadly I didn't open up the box until it was too late to return it. They sent me one that clearly someone else had been using, or trying to use, until they gave up because it's awful. The one they sent me is filthy, missing all the screws that you are supposed to use to put it together, and full of holes from where the last person tried. I tried too, because I figured at this point, why not? It doesn't fit together right, the doors don't stay shut...and that's sitting on my living room floor. I can't even imagine how fast this would fall apart if I actually put it outside. If I could give it zero stars, I would, but the site won't accept a review without at least one star."
1,Do not waste your money,The technical details for this product are incorrect. A much smaller version of this product is shipped by Acehardware---one that can be purchased elsewhere for half the price.
3,4 year review... a significant problem,"I got one of these 4 years ago and am using it in a 95 in the summer environment.... well designed, easy to install, easy to use....there is one problem however:the mail flag has warped significant from sun exposure and is loose thus drooping down the side of the box.... the red color has faded also to the point I'm on here looking for a new box....if you can install it in shade, it will last a lot longer....installation tip:this thing is basically a ""rubbermaid"" type material.... so it's more stable if you install it on a 4x4 that is long enough to go all the way up to the box...."
4,Big enought for small packages,"Mail box was bigger than I expected, big enought for small packages. It's easiest to put together with two people. It looks nice and I'm very happy with it.It was delievered very fast."
2,Mailbox,"This mailbox was very difficult to assemble by oneself. The very first piece to be attached to the bottom would not fit properly. It didn't match-up exactly as it should have. After the box was assembled and the sleeve was attached to the post, it required two people to slide the box onto the base. The back door of the mail box will not stay shut during windy weather. When the mail carrier opens the front door the back one opens. It is not tight enough."
5,Exactly as described!,Roomy mailbox with compartment for newspaper. I like the access doors in the rear of both the mailbox & newspaper compartments.
3,Visually fine...,An item that takes three hands to assemble but is certainly pleasing to the eye. Now to get a more stable anchor for it in lieu of the drive-in anchor I tried.
3,Mail Box,"Needs two more places in front and rear to use screws to secure to post, not just on the sides."
3,Rubbermaid Mailbox,The mailbox was not as heavy as I expected and sometimes the mail gets damp when it rains. Also don't like that the newspaper part of it doesn't click into place as sometimes the newspaper person throws the newspaper in it so it starts going out the back.
4,Vostok K-3 Sub Watch,"It is a very beautiful watch and I do love it. It is great that I do not need a battery ever and that I'd be able to tell if it is day or night by looking at the day/night indicator. However, there is one thing that I noticed that is not really a big deal but I can see it can be to others and that is it tends to runs fast. At times as much as five to ten minutes fast but the effects are not immediate. This happens over a period of a about four days to a week."
4,so far its ok,"its ok for the price, the only thing is that the handle is a little loose for some reason."
5,Great Baby Dishes!,"I love these dish sets and so does my son. They're a great value too considering you get the tray, bowl, cup, and spoon."
3,Another Cleo box set - at least it's fairly inexpensive,"Whenever Cleopatra puts out a box set it's rush, rush, rush to get it - and with this one it's snore, snore, snore as you try to find good tracks. Although the overall box set is well put together, the ""exclusive"" and ""first time on CD"" labels are misleading. Most of the tracks are well known, though the mixes are not the typical ones encountered. Unfortunately - these variations are often not up to the more popular and commonly accessible versions of the tracks.Good groups, ok music. Fair price given how expensive The Goth Box and some other Cleopatra box sets have been in recent history. PS to Cleopatra - if you want to include Industrial in a box set like this, you may want to aim for more than six tracks of it. Anyone who picks this up for a solid industrial gothic mixture of music stands a fair chance of disappointment."
4,You can't go wrong with four discs for less than forty bucks,"It is almost a given that when you buy any type of compilation, not every song is going to be a masterpiece. One can get past that, though, if the majority of the songs are strong. This box set in my opinion has more good stuff than bad. I have been listening to it little by little for the last three days, and I have been able to find excellent tracks on every disc. I even discovered a few bands (e. g. The New Creatures and Suspiria) whose music I will definitely explore further. For that reason, i would definitely recommend it to those who want to explore the sounds of a variety of dark bands without spending a great deal of money. In addition, this set's packaging is absolutely gorgeous! The enclosed book is most helpful with all of its pictures and information on each band and their songs. You can't go wrong if you pick this set up."
2,4 cds of wildly inconsistent music,"Cleopatra Records produces a wide variety of compilations. Some quite good (tribute to pink floyd and gong's YOU remixed) and others awful. This package falls into the awful category. A nicely done package with little inside. Over 50 bands contribute to this. Biggest names are Bauhaus (In the Flat Field), Leg. Pink Dots, Delerium, Fields of Nephilim, Boyd Rice, etc. If you are a true collector of these folks and expect to get something new or really rare, forget it. Most of it is available. The rest of the multitude of bands sound like 80 throwbacks. Nothing really innovative or original. Problem with gothic has always been it's pretentiousness. Cleopatra has already released a variety of dull gothic compilations, why do this again? I am sure there is something in here for everyone, but not everyone will love all of this material. Borrow it from a friend, not worth the price in my opinion."
3,"Lemmy, Slim Jim & Danny B - self-titled (Cleopatra)","I had completely forgot about this one-off (unlikely) side-project. Check out the line-up: Lemmy - acoustic guitar, harmonica, vocals & producer, Slim Jim Phantom (Stray Cats)- drums & vocals and Danny B. Harvey - electric guitar, bass & keyboards. Total of eighteen tracks where the three music veterans pay tribute to the likes of (covering songs by) Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins among others. Just plain fun to put on for a spin. The CD cover is an obvious spoof of the Elvis Presley '50,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong, Volume 2' lp. Needless to say, this title, for Lemmy - is a far cry from anything he'd ever done with Sam Gopal, Hawkwind or Motorhead."
2,Semi bad disks...,Well we got them on time and in good shape but the media couldn't be read by our DVD player!So I found my Macbook could read them and we imported each episode into iTunes and are watching them just fine!
4,This show deserves better... but I'll take what I can get!,"I couldn't find this on Warner's site, and quite frankly, the treatment they are giving this extraordinary show is disgraceful. I got season 5 from Amazon. Pleased that the episode titles are on the disc itself (MUCH easier to handle). Clean if simple, not the best quality ever (remastering, anyone??), but it plays and I get to see Dan (""bombinmybriefcase!"") Fielding at his best-- or worst, depending on how you look at it, haha!I truly wish that there were extras, that someone bothered to talk to the cast, that someone bothered to bring them back together (I did see Charles Robinson and John Larroquette together on ""McBride""-- with Charles as the judge!), that there were bloopers... why is this show treated so shoddily?? But I'll take what I can get, and this is when this show was at its prime. Thank you, whoever you are, for letting it come out in any format at ALL! (But I'll always accept BETTER!!)"
2,So-so Silk Road,"Like the other reviewer, I was expecting far more from this DVD than I got. The visuals are good, but there is too much of Ken Ogata and too little of the fabulous towns and cities of the Silk Road. What ever happened to Samarkand and Istanbul?Indeed, the whole video would benefit by being edited down by half an hour. Overlong sequences of Ken trudging along railway tracks and desert skylines for the benefit of the camera become boring after a while, and a detailed closeup of Ken eating a lemon in elaborate detail is a definite turnoff.Either buy the original 30 part TV series on eBay from China, or wait for the proposed new Yo Yo Ma TV musical journey along the Silk Road."
1,Disappointing,"I am researching the Silk Road for a novel I am writing and hoped that this could give me some insight to the terrain and the customs of the people. I was highly disappointed.While it did give some inshght to culture and spirituality, it left me wanting so much more. Travelogs have come a long way and this one is not up to today's standards. While an interresting tale, the dialog was at times tedious and laborious. Most interviews and encounters were not translated into English.Not worth the money, even at the modest $10 I gave for it."
4,Feel the Heat,"This novel of evil and intrigue in Nigeria and Benin reeks with authenticity. You can feel the African heat. But the protagonist, Bruce Medway, is cool -- cool and deliberate and focused. With foes stalking him he, nevertheless, pursues a noble cause -- solving the mystery of the disappearing schoolgirls. Wilson is a master of the organic plot which unfolds naturally, not relying on coincidence or heavy-handed serendipity to solve plot problems and, in so doing, insult the reader's intelligence. This was my first Africa book by this outstanding writer and I look forward to reading his others."
2,Not so good.,"Robert Wilson is definitely a very, very good suspense writer. His Javier Falcon series is his best because the character is very believable and the stories are complex enough to hold one's interest. The Bruce Medway character is a little less believable because of all the alcohol intake that would put a person out of perspective and out of commission. This is really not his best writing."
4,I love Robert Wilson,What can I say - just love his work and I was not disappointed. What I am disappointed about is that he is not very well known in the U.S. His books far exceed the inane crap that gets to #1 on the best seller lists. Go figure.
1,No insight,"I agree with the one star rating; if someone runs a query on each term (in this book), say in mathematica/wiki etc., and then concatenates the defintions together - the outcome will resemble this book very closely. Well, may be that is an overstatement, but you get the point!Horrible book for someone who looks for some intuition/motivation. It may be a great book for a hardcore mathematician who can gather inspiration from absolute abstraction. Not for a geometric-intuition-searching soul."
3,pre runner to series lost,"although i now remember seeing this ,it was the sea hound i was thinking of, secret bases under water sea monster , speed boats chases , phantoms of my gone youth"
4,Suddenly it happened,"After the video version of this delightful musical appeared, I knew it wouldn't be long before the soundtrack would be released! A real gem of a musical! The Sherman Brothers prove that Mary Poppins was not a fluke...In fact I like Slipper and the Rose better! One of the best numbers is ""What a wonderful thing to know"",even though one misses the acrobatics that accompany it in the film. And in case you were wondering, Richard Chamberlain really can and stil does sing very well...no dubbing here! Very enjoyable recording. Thank you for releasing it!"
5,Wonderful as expected :),I loved watching the Slipper and the Rose as a child and this movie is still high on my favorites list. I was overjoyed to find the soundtrack on CD so I can listen to the fun songs whenever I feel like it :) The quality of the sound is really impressive.
5,My Dream has come true!!!!,"I cannot express how thrilled I am to finally own this wonderful piece of music. My only fear is that I will wear it out listening to is so much. This is truly a work of art. A must for anyone who loves passionate, heart-wrenching, yet joyful and witty songs. I will be eternally grateful to the Sherman Brothers for their willingness to share there talent, and to Jenni for her hard work to get it released. You are sadly missing out if you have never heard this. Do not wait a moment longer."
5,Hope springs in all,"Well, finding this (thanks to a very dear friend) i just had to buy it. On first listen, it was like greeting long lost friends and finding out you still have so much in common. This cd is probably not for you if you have never grown up with the film, as i did, as the lyrics are cheesey and corny, but totally fantastic at the same time. You can sing your heart out as the booklet has the words, and relive all those moments from the film, as just about every song is included. From the hilarious 'A Bride Finding Ball' to the mega dramatic 'Tell Him Anything', fans of this movie will find the songs in their original form from the film , which is all you could really ask for. A treat for any sentamentalist!!"
5,"Enhanced with more than 50 maps, documents and photographs","In New Orleans Jazz: A Revised History, Collins surveys the development of a uniquely American music from its southern origins in the founding of New Orleans in 1718 down to the era of the Big Bands. This remarkable music history is enhanced with more than 50 maps, documents and photographs. Informative, meticulously researched, articulate and engaging, New Orleans Jazz: A Revised History is very highly recommended reading for all students of jazz history, and an invaluable addition to any academic or community library American music history collection."
1,"In the State of Denmark, There is the Pungency of Decay","Not to put too strong a term to it, but this glorified short story sold as a novel stinks. There is no trace of the Master's hand in the writing. I see Mr. Gracely has tried again. Oh, well, practice makes perfection--or so they say. I would gladly give this, this BOOK a zero if I could. Quoth the Raven..."
2,Just frustrating!,"I purchased this CD thinking that I would at least be treated to the full-length version of ""Ma Quale Idea."" but what's in it is the radio edit version, and at 3:57, it's even a lot shorter than the version that appears in his ""I Successi"" album. This song was a smash hit in the early 80's, and I don't know why they would release the radio edit version instead of the 12"" version that used to be heard in all the coolest clubs. It's still a great song, but it's just way too short a version to appreciate."
2,Not bad but............,"I was eluded with the idea this was like the original tigress........NOT!!!!! Although this is a beautiful scent. Its very green smelling but don't expect it to last longer than fifteen minutes, I just put it on and its already fading as fast as ice melting on a hot summer day! You get what you pay for, just remember that when ordering."
5,Can't get no better,This CD is the best one I have gotten from dirty. I have all of their cds and they seem to get better as they go along... Bun B is my all time favorite and the fact that they do a song with him speaks very highly of their skills. I would buy this cd for all of my friends if I had the money to.
1,"I don't mean to hate but this ins't ""Dirty's "" Best Album.","Them Dirty Boyz have 2 Album with a weak production ""The Pimp & 'Da Gangsta"" and ""Love Us or Hate Us"". 5.0 out of 5.0 both albums are more recommented from me.sorry if my 1 star f*** up the scale."
4,Hmmmm,"Lady Alex is a plucky young lady who upon finding her twin brother has gambled away the family fortune (and got in to debt!) decides to disguise herself as her brother to win enough money gambling to cover his debts and restore the family fortune.There are some small problems:1) The amounts alluded to in the gambling are astronomical for those days, I feel it's a bit over done.2) The inheritance issue, her father decides to use a lesser title so people don't associate him with his family, I am not sure that is possible or at least very probable.Apart from these small problems I very much enjoyed the book."
4,"Charming, as always","For readers of traditional regency romances, Evelyn Richardson never disappoints. This one is a particular favorite of mine, because I especially like the cross-dressing heroine theme. Lady Alexandra saves the day and meets a man who can match her for intelligence, strength of character, and physical prowess. Lady Alex, her brothers and sisters, and the heroine, are all charming, interesting characters with just a few flaws to make them interesting."
1,faux naif - garbage!,"Get something relatively real as for example anything from the great Robert Walser. This novel struck me as pure affectation. I didn't finish it. Bought it at a garage sale on account of the publisher having put out a version of Huysman's ""Downstream"". This is not in the same class, not at all. Phoney, fun for a few pages, then as short as it is, interminable!"
5,Great If You Love the Movie,"If you love ""Kamikaze Girls"" then this is a great album. The music is definitely different than the usual things you'd hear on the radio, a mix of classical, French, and Japanese all in one album. A few of the songs also sound like they're from the 50's. I generally think it's a great album if I'm in the mood for something different. Due to the high price (since it's an import) I'd watch the movie first to make sure you enjoy the film and music before paying this much."
3,that much?!?,"love the movie,love the music. If you think im paying 50 dollars at the min amount you are out of your gord. get back to me when your willing to sell it for 20 dollars and don't say that its out of printed or imported still to much for what it is."
4,Best one I've had,"This is a heavy duty unit with many options. It's a bit heavy at 20 lbs, but the power is worth the weight trade-off. Particularly like the option to turn off the rotating brush for bare floors and fringed rugs. Other vacuums tended to 'eat' carpet fringe."
3,The belt has broken twice in three uses,"I read the reviews on Amazon and other sources and anticipated that this would be an excellent vacuum choice for my family. However, when using the attachment setting the vacuum smells like it is burning, and the main belt of the vacuum has broken twice in three uses. I am concerned that this problem will continue, and I am not terribly happy about my purchase.I will say that it is pretty easy to use, it vacuums up pet hair very well (when the belt is not broken), it works well on hardwood floors and the attachments are adequate. I probably just got a dud, but I wanted to warn other purchasers."
2,Boss Smart -Vac upright Vacuum,"This came out of the box not working correctly, it smelled of burning rubber and the belt was not on right. I had to call the company and take the machine apart to get it working. I can't keep the attachments on the machine, they keep falling off and the hoses and tubes don't make any logical sense the way they go together. It has good suction, but blows so much air out the front that vacuuming along side anything cloth (like curtains or bed linens)is quite the challenge. It is VERY heavy and unless you have the carpet setting just right it is extremely hard to push. Since I purchased this vacuum on Amazon I have seen better vacuums cheaper at nearby department stores so I don't feel I got a very good deal."
2,Belt breaks all the time!,"The brush roll control switch is poorly designed. You have to force it until it clicks into the ""Bare Floor"" position. This never really completely disengages the belt though ... I can smell the belt material burning away. Then when it's time to clean the carpeted rooms, it breaks. This happens about every two uses. Also the handle release is REALLY hard to engage. I'm ready to trash this thing if I cannot get it replaced or fixed."
3,just ok,haven't used it a lot yethas trouble picking up dog hairsort of rolls it in a ball to throw it away by hand
4,Eureka 4870GZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright Vacuum,Good value vacuum. Pick-up vacuum is good since you can switch between floor and hose. Also like the feature of being able to turn off beater carpet brush.
2,didn't last long,"We bought this vacuum based on consumer reports' rating. However, the vacuum did not last long. The suction was not strong b/c of the construction of the vacuum: the hose is basically the main vacuum, and when it is not being used as a hose, it connects to the main section and suctions through that, resulting in weaker suction by the time it gets to the base. After about 1-2 years, the vacuum died."
2,Awkward,"Bought this vacuum because I'd seen good reviews for it. However, it's heavy, awkward to use, and the hose and attachments keep falling off the back while I'm vacuuming."
4,Strong suction but heavy.,This vacuum is very good with strong suction. My only complaint...it is very heavy and especially hard to vacuum stairs.
4,Great price - great performance for the price,"The foot lever on this vacuum (that allows the upright to tilt back) is hard to press, but its performance for this reasonably priced vacuum is still worth it.Our sneaky cat had thrown up on the carpet behind the dining room table and it had already dried before it was noticed. This upright vacuumed it up in one or two passes - no residue (and thankfully, no stain) was left."
1,Worst vacuum I ever had,I would never buy another Eureka vacuum. The belt breaks once a month. I follow the directions from the repairman to never lock or unlock the upright position while it is running. We only use it on low pile carpeting or bare floor.
3,so-so,"Ranked very highly by consumer magazine, and it does pick-up well and the HEPA seems to work very well. The negatives: it's heavy, has a short hose, the power paw is not that good, and the Eureka rep mislead me about features (dirt alert and bag change indicators) so I didn't get all that I was looking for."
4,I like it!!,I was going to get the Hoover based on consumer reports but after reading the reviews here I opted to purchase the 2nd best as rated by consumer reports. I am very happy that I did. One thing that I agree with is it is hard to release the handle without shoes on but other than that I am extreamly satisfied.
4,Good vacuum for the price,"Does the job it is suppose to do. Vacuum is heavy and the attachments do not stay in place on the vacuum and the release sticks. However, it does suck up alot of dirt and pet hair and is fairly powerful."
2,Hate it. Gave it to the Thrift shop,"I used this Eureka through one vaccum bag cycle. The design tries to stick all the attachments all over the machine and they are constantly falling off.It does suck up the dust and dirt well. Very noisy. Too big, heavy, and complicated.But after the next set of bags arrived (buy more when/if you buy this) it was still blowing out dust rather than sucking it inlI also found it clumsy to handle. And I basically hate it. So, I gave it to the thrift shop with the set of nine new bags I'd just got, because it works. Someone else can wrestle with it.I replaced it with a Bissell ($66.00) at Wal-Mart. Same features, easier to put together and handle... lighter weight. The attachments are snuggly on. It has two HEPA filters and no bags.I do not need a ""Boss."""
2,Vacuum: Broken belt after 30 days,"I only had the vacuum for about 30 days when I noticed the belt needed to be replaced. The problem is that the belt has no way of coming off. I followed the instructions but there is no gap on the motorshaft end for the belt to slide off.The release handle does take getting used to as it is quite stiff and the rug beater is hard to turn off for bare floor use. It does a good job of vacuuming but I can't use the vacuum without a belt, which won't come off so I am returning this defective vacuum."
5,Great Vacuum!,"We've only owned this vacuum for approximately 2 months so I can't comment on the durability of this product. However, our initial opinion is 'it's great'! In the past, we have been Dirt Devil users, tried and true. I would still say if anyone is looking for a very affordable vacuum with a lot of suck a Dirt Devil is a great way to go. However, they are extremely lightweight and if you use your hose for walls, upholstery, etc.(which I do, constantly!), the vacuum falls over. Not so, with our new Eureka! It is a very heavy vacuum with no chance of falling over. It is excellent in brushing up the dirt and picking it up, even in tight places, i.e. baseboards, etc. We feel it is an affordable vacuum for the quality of its performance. I also like the fact that it uses bags. I'm just not into the bagless feature of so many of today's vacuums. We are glad we've given this Eureka a try."
1,Unwieldy,"This is a brute and the build quality is poor. My wife is always complaining about how difficult it is to move and lift this vacuum. In addition the lever to unlock the handle is extremely difficult to operate. Lastly, the vacuum no longer works on hardwood floors. There are much better options available."
5,Impressed with performance,"Just purchased this model. I went with Consumer Reports recommendation. I was surprised with the amount of suction this model produces. I would agree that there is room for improvement with other aspects of this vacuum cleaner, but delivers your money's worth. By the way, a longer hose attachment is available at the manufacturer's website on-line store. I just discovered it and ordered one."
4,great but VERY heavy,"I've been using a much lighter Orek, which needs renovating, which costs $100 or thereabouts, so I looked for a new vac. This thing is the best I've seen for vacuuming, bar none, BUT it is very heavy. No more lugging the vac. up and downstairs, it's just too heavy. And the adjustments are STIFF - not only to set the height of the rollers to adjust to carpet depth, but also just to stand it horizontal or move it down to an angle to use. It's very wide, and as I say, does a great job, but beware if you're not used to heavy lifting!"
4,The Boss Smart Upright Does A Good Job,"All the past several vacs I've had were Kenmores, but decided to try something not as costly but that had a a good rating by Consumer's Reports. This vacuum does a great job cleaning carpeting and bare floors. The suction is as good as or better than a Kenmore. The suction is NOT as good using the attachment tools, but it is definitely adequate to do most jobs. The housing construction leaves a bit to be desired;it does not operate as smoothly and easily as the Kenmores I've had. You have to press HARD to get the pedal down to start vacuuming. But now that I am used to the machine it's no big deal. Overall, I'd highly recommend this vac if you're looking for one that does a very good job but is not as pricey as some other models."
2,broke already,"The suction was okay, but the paw arrived broke, and the unit makes a terrible noise on hard floors."
4,Powerful but heavy,"This product has great suction for the price and therefore is a very good value. However, if the vacuum will be used by a senior it may be too heavy for them to handle comfortably."
4,good,"well i needed to replace an old vacuum and i am happy with this except the little button you push with your foot to release the thing, that makes it lean back... gets stuck.. it's ok, but i have to use my hand to push it down. ok, but sort of annoying. it also needs a longer hose. the people who previously reviewed it, told me the hose was too short, NOW I REALLY AGREE! and it's kind of heavy. even though i am freakishly strong, it can be cumbersom. it works well though."
5,Better than excellent!,"I bought this machine to replace an Oreck that died and wasn't worth replacing. The Oreck was nice and light at 8 pounds. By comparison, this is a monster.But what a monster! It is terrific at cleaning carpeting and bare floors. A little difficult to navigate on stairs because of its weight, but the attachments help.This was a highly rated vacuum in Consumer Reports. At under $150, I could get several of these for the price of an Oreck or Dyson.Highly recommended!"
4,"If pet hair is a problem, this is your machine",:) It cleans cat hair like Consumer's Report said it would. The upholstery turbo- brush attachment works better than anything else we have tried.:( The machine is heavy for going up stairs and the hose could be a little longer.
4,great sweepeer for the price,A lot of power for the price. It cleaned my carpets better than any vacuuum I've had. Lowe's carries the sweeper for $148 plus free shipping to local stores. Sears also carries it and will price match local and online prices plus 10% of the difference. Got mine at Sears. FYI
2,not what 'consumer reports' makes it out to be,"I bought this a year ago based on the 'consumer reports' article. It cleans well enough, but is very large, heavy and difficult to manuver. I'm a nurse and work a very physical 12 hr shift, so at first I thought managing this vacuum would be 'no problem', but even thought I CAN do the work, I sure don't like it. It's extra wide and doesn't fit where my prior vacuum could go. It's heavy and bulky and you really have to hit your foot down to release the handle to guide the vacuum. It makes a terrible noise when you go over bare flooring if you forget to twist this 'not too easy to twist' dial to change to the 'bare floor' mode(A different control than the height adjuster). The bag is smaller than prior models I've had and is not a commonly found type. The hepa filter is nice and the cleaning is decent, but wish I'd checked around a little more. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it. It's too much of a chore to use."
5,A Vacuum Cleaner That Works... At Last,"I am so happy with this product. I got mine right here on Amazon and could not be happier with it. It is so light and easy to use and I use it on my most expensive carpet and in cleaning out my fireplace. I have had much more expensive vacuum cleaners that didn't come close to this thing. It really is ""The Boss"" of vacuum cleaners."
4,Great Vacuum!,"Just bought this from Amazon.com - upgraded to Prime and got overnight shipping for $3.99 - incredible. Piece of cake to snap on the back/arm piece and then 3 screws. Bag already in place, organized the tools and turned it on! The suction was amazing. I started vacuuming the rug in our family room and it literally picked it up - raised the nap and made it look brand new. Took it into the living room and again, made the nap raise up and look like it is brand new. Attached the power paw and ""whizzzzz"" it almost took off - cleaned our stairs very well.I love everything about this product - the ability to see the roller brush and through the hose. It is quiet, light weight, easy to push, and it really has incredible suction.The only neurtal point I have is the floor to carpet switch - it can be a bit tricky to set... and that is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5."
5,Good vacuum for the money.....,"Just received this week. Pd. $125.00 using the promo code. Free shipping. I am pleased! Replaced a Sharp Twin Turbo that I paid waaay too much for and never loved in the first place. Sharp lasted only 2 1/2 yrs. - motor burned up!!Don't see, as many reviewers seem to, that this vacuum is hard to manuver or that the foot lever is difficult to push. Great suction! I am happy with the Eureka 4870GZ and the timely service from Amazon. Can't find it cheaper anywhere ... not even Wal-mart. Remember to use the promo code to save $25."
4,Pretty good vacuum,Cleans well but quite heavy to push. Attachment placements are at back of vacuum and difficult to attach. Suction and bristle bar does a good job of picking-up dirt.
4,Features,"After seeing and using my daughter's vacuum, we investigated various makes and models and settled on Eureka and then learned that this model is an upgrade of my daughter's vacuum. Then we checked prices in all the locations we could find. Amazon had the best price and incentives for this model vacuum. We like the features and flexibility that this vacuum has and look forward to using it for years to come"
5,AWESOME PRODUCT RATED #1 for A REASON!!!,This Vacuum is rated #1 in Consumer reports for GOOD REASON! IT IS THE BEST VACUUM I'VE EVER USED! IT'S AWESOME! WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY! Cheapest place I found it is Wal-mart for approximately $140.00. I owed a cleaning company and have tried MANY MANY products and I was shocked by how much power this Vacuum has for little money! WONDERFUL PRODUCT! THANK YOU EUREKA!!!
5,Very Impressed!,"I am so pleased with this vacuum cleaner; and with the discounts it's such a great deal! It has better suction than any other vacuum I've ever owned; seems very professional. I really like the attachments and the overall design is attractive. I like the idea of having clear hoses/tubing. One down side is that it's a bit heavier than other vacuums and can be hard to maneuver, but it glides forward easily. The foot pedal lever can be difficult to press down but I think I've gotten used to it already. It took a few times to figure out the lever that switches between bare floor and carpet to turn off the revolving brush; I've figured that out now.Well, I won't write a book as others have. I think this vacuum cleaner is worthy of an excellent review. There are some very minor down sides that are far outweighed by the good ones."
4,Consumer Report on the Money Again!,"After checking Consumer Report on vacuum cleaners in the price range we were interested in, we went with their advice and , as usual, they were not wrong. This is a great vacuum for the price. The suction is unbelievable! You can hear the dirt being pulled from the carpet.The foot peddle is a little hard to push down,but other than that, we have no complaints.Kudos also to Amazon. We ordered this vacuum on line on a Wednesday and it was at my door by Friday afternoon!!! What great service."
2,vacuum tested,"After owning this vacuum cleaner for about 1 year, I feel very strongly about the following items. First, the vacuum has very good suction. Second, the foot lever to operate the vacuum is very difficult to acctuate unless you are wearing shoes, I frequently have only socks on around the house, and this is a poor design feature. Third, the power cord is placed half way down the body of the vacuum, and makes it very difficult to reach when vacuuming. Lastly, the hose placement is also very poorly designed, when using the hose with attachments, it makes for a much more laborious chore than it needs to be. Overall, I am only impressed with this vacuum's power/suction."
5,Wonderful for the price!,"This thing really sucks, and in a good way. It seems to pick up most things on the carpet, and being able to turn off the rotating brush, will pick up most things on our hardwood floors and ceramic tile floors. It does a good job cleaning.I do have some complaints. At the edge of rooms (at the walls), it takes a little effort to get the area clean. But using the attached hose allows for cleaning the edge. It takes a little effort to push the vacuum around when the brush is on, on the carpet. For me it's not a problem, but for my wife it's hard. Finally, we vacuumed new carpet, and while it did a very good job getting all the loose strands, it did get clogged. It was visible in the clear tubing that it was clogged. Removing the clear tubing to remove the clog was very difficult.Overall, I gave this vacuum 5 stars because it cleans better than most in the same price range."
4,Powerful sucker,"Lots of features. Travels forward easily. Takes some effort to pull back. Result of the great amount of suction. Cleans well. Has tool storage that holds all tools on-board but one; it won't stay on. Otherwise, it's a great vacuum. Great value."
5,4870GZ Boss Smart Vac Upright Vacuum,"This is the best vacuum I've ever used. I have pets that shed ALOT so I needed a vacuum that is good with pet hair and after trying out several, this one is by far the best. It is very heavy but it is self-propelled so it's easy to use."
4,Vacuum for SHORT people.,"This is an excellent vacuum, quiet, clean, and really sucks. The only complaint because we are taller people (6-4 and 5-8) is that the handle is too short and not adjustable."
2,It squeaks,I purchased this vacuum because of its positive review for pet hair. So far I haven't noticed a difference in the amount of hair it gets versus my old cleaner. Also it squeaks. I'm not too impressed since it was rated so highly in Consumers Reports.
3,"Good Vac, a bit dusty",The vacuum picks up really well and it's not heavy or overly noisey. The only issue I have with it is the dust. Even with the filtration it blows dust and after every use I have to dust it when I am finished.
4,Eureka Boss Upright vacuum,"The only complaint I have about this product is that it's very heavy. However, it does an excellent job on rugs, tile, & hardwood floors."
4,Love it!!!!,"I am really happy with this vacuum!! I works great, is self propelled and picks up dog hair like crazy!! I love the fact that it has the option to turn off the rotating brush when I am vacuuming hard wood floors. The only thing I don't like (which is minor) is the fact that you have to turn a dial to change the ""mode"" from floor to hose. I am used to just pulling out the hose and the switch being automatic, so it is more a ""user flaw"" than a product flaw. But over all, I have been really happy with this product, and considering the fact that I am a ""clean freak"" with two dogs and three kids, I can't complain!!"
5,The best vaccum I've ever had!,I bought this vaccum because I saw that consumer reports had voted it a best buy and it is. I have a dog who is allowed on my furniture and he leaves a ton on hair. This vaccum has an attachment to take care of the pet hair and it works great. The only thing that I don't love is how heavy it is.
3,vacuum review,"Well, it does a decent job of vacuuming but it is heavy and a bit difficult to get from hard floor to carpet mode. I was used to an Oreck so am a bit spoiled but wanted something that the hose was attached, the Oreck it is a completely separate machine. I would definitely not get if you have stairs or have problems lifting, fine for single level but wouldn't highly recommend it."
1,Useles for pet hair,"I find this vacuum totally unacceptable for the cleaning I have to do. Pet hair does not come up. I've had to disassemble the vacuum several times in the last nine months to remove clogs. Hard to push. Brush stops rotating on the carpet, regardless of the height settings. Attachments fall out of their sockets. On the plus side - it does have a powerful motor and good suction (when it's not completely clogged)."
1,Eureka Vacuum Cleaner,"Too cumbersome, too heavy, takes a lot of effort to pull back on carpet, too many gadgets and dials."
3,Big disappointment,"I was shocked that this vacuum did not perform well after all the reviews praising it. We have both hard wood and carpeting. When I vacuum the hard wood I can feel dust, etc coming out of the back. It does not seem to suction well. It does a better job on carpeting but I do not feel the beaters work hard enough. If I try to adjust the height it seems to stick. The hose does work wonderfully and is much easier to use then my prior vacuum. Also this vacuum is much quieter!! That is a big plus."
1,Beater Brushroll broke after 3 months,"I thought this vacuum was great, initially - great suction, Consumer Reports Best Buy, blah, blah blah. Then three months after buying it and light use, the beater brushroll quit working, which means it doesn't suction on carpet. The hose still works great, so we'll keep it clean out the ashes in the fireplace. I bought the Bissell Total Floors Velocity as a replacement and LOVE IT!! Check out its reviews before you waste you money and time here."
4,It sucks!,In this case that is a good thing.Seems a bit cheaply made and not the easiest to maneuver but it does a good job of cleaning on both carpet and hard surfaces.Not so thrilled by the onboard tools which fall off. Took me a while to figure out how to use the hose extension. The turbo brush screams like a banshee. We have an old Kirby (22 yrs) which still works well but we wanted another vacuum for upstairs to save lugging it up and down. The Eureka is slightly quieter. There were some sharp molding ridges in the handle which I filed off and now it's reasonably comfortable.
1,Don't buy this item,We used it 3 times and it no longer works. Smells like the motor is burning. Brush and height adjustment don't work. Heavy to use.
3,Bait and Switch,"I purchased this last week and received it a few days later. Machine works well so far, but today noticed on the box that it is a remanufactured unit. I could have purchsed a refurb for at least $40 cheaper than what Amazon charged me, and nowhere did it indicate that it was not a new product. Shame to lose trust in a company that you used to do regular business with"
1,Worthless POS,"After approximately 2 hours of combined use, the belt stretched so much it wouldn't vacuum anything. This was light duty, easy or normal use without getting anything stuck in the brush head. After a fairly exhaustive search locally to find a belt, I gave up. Before I knew it my wife had junked it and it was gone from our lives.This thing is heavy, loud, only fair suction and the worst belt I have even seen. It looks like the belt is made of plastic. Buyer beware, so much for using this as a ""downstairs/second"" vacuum. ""EUREKA"" for no more Eureka."
2,Cheaply made...,"Loved this vacuum when I first got it. Only negatives were that the hose was too short and the on-board attachments kept falling off but it sucked everything up on my hardwood floors and on my rugs. I've had the vacuum for less than 2 years now and it is a total piece of junk. It has slowly fallen apart piece by piece. All the attachments have cracked and the hose has ripped numerous times. I keep taping it back together. It has ""zero"" suction anymore when I try to use the hose and I'm back shopping for a new vacuum cleaner in less than 2 years. I do use my vacuum about 5X a week but I expected to get more use out of a 139.00 vacuum. Very disappointed in the quality."
3,Well-priced but flawed,"Cleaning functions are quite good, but the vacuum is noisy and requires extraordinary effort to turn on with the foot pedal."
1,KNOWN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM,The step switch that allows you to move the upper part of the vacuum cleaner from the upright storage position to the vacuum position is extremely hard. It required over 155 pounds to unlatch our unit. It is a shame that Eureka continues to ship this vacuum with a KNOWN OPERATIONAL PROBLEM.
1,Don't believe Consumer Reports,"I purchased this vacuum because it came highly rated on consumer reports - it is a piece of junk. First I had problems with the brush, then I had to special order the HEPA filter because no store around had one. After about six months the step clip thing fell off - and whenever I vacuum, it falls off.The vacuum bag door always pops up - latch isn't broken, but it doesn't hold either. Vacuuming is a frustating experience to say the least.The section isn't bad - but considering everything that happens during vacuuming (bag door popping off, step clip not holding). I would say that this vacuum is a huge waste of money. I've had mine for a little over a year and I need to buy another one as this one is just frustrating to use."
3,Be careful with floor setting!,"This vacuum is all it's made out to be on carpeting. In that respect, It's a champ. It's also heavy, so be aware of this.One problem we encountered right away. The floor settings didn't keep the Boss from gouging the vinyl flooring in our entryway!"
1,Great for three weeks...,"Loved it for the first three weeks, then things started to break, beginning with the door latch. This was followed by the hose leaking and the brush ceasing to function. Too bad, because I thought it was a great machine to begin with."
4,Not bad at all,I'd grown so tired of our old vacuum (an overpriced Tri-Star that we've been lugging around since 1994) and it was such a relief to have the Eureka arrive in the mail.What I've noticed is this:1. It does a great job on carpet.2. It does a fine job on bare floors.3. The release latch to that allows you to move the handle is very stiff.4. I can no longer reach under furniture that I used to be able to reach...from now on I'll be moving furniture out of the way or living with the dust bunnies.The Consumer Reports review was accurate.For a hundred fifty bucks it works just fine and I'm content.
3,Eureka SmartVac,"The vacuum cleaner is large, bulky and has very strong suction - unraveled the binding on a rug! Doesn't fit under low furniture such as beds, sofas, etc. Very heavy and difficult for users with back problems to maneuver. Weight of item was not given in the advertisment. Attachments do not stay on storage brackets. Power button is not conveniently located and power cord does not retract automatically."
1,Not that great - eats belts,"I bought this after reading consumer reports review. We have 3 cats and it works OK, but not better than my old hoover windtunnel. The biggest problem is that it eats belts. I went through two belts in the first two months. The belts are very thin compared to any other vacuum I've seen and they just dont hold up."
5,Better Than Advertised,"I've had this vacuum now for several weeks, and have found it to do an excellent job of cleaning. I particularly like the longer cord which permits me to vacuum larger areas without having to change plugs. The suction has really cleaned my carpets and made them look much better. This vacuum is replacing an earlier Eureka ""Best Buy"", which in its time did a good job, but nowhere nearly as good as this one. It is rather heavy, but no more so than advertised. To me it is a small price to pay for great the performance it provides. An outstanding value!"
4,Great vacuum for the price,"I'd rate it 5 stars, but I only have had it for a few weeks. Everything is working very well so far, great suction and the tools (power paw especially) are great! We were originally looking at the Dyson, but had heard that the Eureka Boss was just as good for much less of a price. As a proud new owner of the Eureka Boss, I must agree. If you want a great vacuum at a great price, go with this product. Great job Eureka!"
1,Major Problem with this vacuum cleaner,"The step switch that allows you to move the upper part of the vacuum cleaner from the upright storage position to the vacuum position is extremely hard.I mean Hard. It takes a shot from your foot with a soled shoe to move it. My wife has me do itBrought it to the Eureka Warranty Repair shop after using it twice and they told me that was the way it is.I called Eureka and they said, Yes it is hard, but should loosen up over time.Now trying to decide if we will return to Amazon"
5,I love it!!,"I have had this vacuum cleaner for several months now. It works great! I just had to clog up my previous vacuum. With my long thick hair and a dog that sheds constantly, I needed a vacuum cleaner that would be great at picking up. And it does just that."
4,"Vacuum has good suction, kind of noisy","I've owned this vacuum for 4 months now, and it works well on hard-surfaces or carpet. The attachments and hose work well for sweeping up pet hair in the car or furniture. The suction seems good on this vacuum. The only downside is that it seems a lot noisier than my previous vacuum."
4,Great vacuum overall,"I had an old Eureka for many years and it was time to upgrade. The old one had been good in its day, but it was becoming a bit senile. I was in for a pleasant surprise with the Boss Smart-Vac, because I had forgotten what a good vacuum cleaner is really like. The suction is so good that I had to move the height to highest for my medium-pile carpet. Along with the great beater-brush I was amazed how fast the cleaning was, single passes was sufficient. The only thing I didn't care for (ergo the 4 star) was the hose extended from the lower part of the unit. Not a serious problem but tended to pull to the bottom too much when using the wand and attachments from a standing position. If the rating had allowed, I'd have given it a 4.5 !!!!"
3,Motor Burned out!,"Just 6 months out of warranty and 1 1/2 years after purchase, the motor burns out halfway through vaccuuming my house! When I took it to get fixed they said it was unfixable and cheaply made of all plastic parts! Don't buy unless you want to replace cleaners every 1-2 years. Worked fine while it was working. Very disappointed!"
2,Great suction - cheap material,"For the price, not bad. I have had one for about 2.5 years and it's been cleaning up after the hair of a Border Collie very effectively on wall-to-wall and persians. The bag is easy and relatively tidy to replace. Within two weeks of its purchase, however, the piece that holds the unit upright snapped. Now the switch is fried, I can't turn it on, and it's beyond warranty of course. I am trying to decide whether it will be less expensive to buy something new or get the switch fixed. Unnerving when my parents' last vacuum lasted about 20 years before it died."
4,Eureka 4870GZ,"After researching and finding Consumer reports listing this as beating the Dyson for much less, we decided to try it. It is a VERY good vacuum. Lives up to all the Hype and does a wonderful job."
1,OUT OF THE BOX,DOES NOT WORK . THE DRIVE BELT IS LOOSE AND SMELLS LIKE ITS BURNING!!! I ORDERED 2 NEW DRIVE BELTS PLUS BAGS .REPLACED DRIVE BELT SAME THING. WHAT DO I DO NOW . CALL EUREKA - WHAT A PAIN!!!!
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I was on a quest to find a vacuum with a stretchy hose. I was tired of my old vacuum tipping over when I'd clean with the hose and attachments; it just had no give. The hose on this is VERY STRETCHY! However, after using this for about two years, the hose is now stretched out, and it droops from its storage spot, and gets in my way when I vacuum. Also, from the start I found it very difficult to snap the hose attachments into their storage places on the back of the vacuum. They continually fall off and after losing them several times I now store them in another place. Also, it is too wide to get into many tight spots. And finally, it is crazy HEAVY. It vacuums great so I'm giving it three stars, but there are so many negative features to this I was tempted to give it two."
4,Quality vacuum for the price,"UPDATE 8/6/09: After 18 months of use, the suction power is still very strong. Really impressed!I've had this vacuum for about 15 months and have no complaints. It's not light, but most uprights in this category are not. I have no problems maneuvering this thing around on carpet/hardwood. I am still impressed with its suction power! Great for picking up loose hairs, food, and dust. I use it about once a week and have only had to change out bags every few months. A good buy at this price and recommended."
1,Broke after 40 days,The vacuum is heavy and did clean well when it works. It is very hard to manuver though. The belt broke after about a month. Something is not adjusting the belt and is makes a burning rubber smell. To get it fixed I have to drive 2 hours to phoenix. They do not have send in warranty service. I will never by another Eureka.
2,Not Recommended,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009WRKSYI purchased this vacuum Cleaner in Jan. of 2007. At that time it seemed as though the item worked as any new product usually does. This item's rotating brush can't rotate when placed on the rug at any setting. What I have resorted to doing is slightly lifting the vacuum cleaner enough to allow the brush to rotate. I have changed the belts repeatedly to no avail. If anyone out there has a solution to this delemna, I'd like to hear from you. On the brighter side, the suction is phenomenal. What good is that if it won't clean the carpet as it was designed to do. I do not recommend this product."
1,No deal here,The hose broke within the first six months. It is too heavy and the foot switch to lower the vacuum is almost impossible to operate. This vacuum is made in Mexico and it is not hard to figure that out right away. I don't recommend this vacuum.
2,Hose comes out and is too short - Very Annoying!!!,"Although this vacuum has excellent suction, it is the worst vacuum I've owned. The hose constantly comes out while vacuuming, and it doesn't reach far enough to do two stairs. I finally upgraded to the Dyson, which has a hose that reaches all the way up the stairs!"
4,attachment doesn't stay stowed,"I like this vacuum overall.One thing I find annoying is that the small attachment for vacuuming upholstery does not stay in its storage place on the back of the vacuum while you are using it, only if the cord is wrapped up for storage. This means it gets misplaced or left behind, or carried off by one of my kids. Eureka should be able to fix this on future models.Otherwise, it works well and does a good job on all my carpets and floors."
2,Unbelievably heavy,"There's no denying that this vacuum has powerful suction (hence the 2 star rating). I just don't think that heavy weight of the machine is worth it. This vacuum is so heavy and cumbersome that I am not able to push my foot down on the handle release without wearing shoes for leverage. I read previous reviews that it was heavy and thought I could deal with it (I've been lugging my kids around for years, what could be more taxing than that?). After using it for 9 months now, I absolutely hate it and wish I had bought a lighter model."
1,Eureka 4870GZ Boss,Obviously this product was designed by a male. Lots of power but much too heavy to use. Not good if you have to move up and down stairs and the hose attachment not long enough to get under beds or sofas. I rate this NO STARS. I hope I get my money back
2,Eureka's Bulky Boss,This item was a waste of my money. Picture a heavy unit that you have the pleasure of moving around. If you have stairs it works well but again it is heavy. The hard plastic wheels are great on my carpet but my slate floor get scuffed up. The switch for carpet/bare floor is hard to move at best and I sometimes have my husband do it for me. The hose attachment is nice but pulls the vac around with you all the time. Watch your toes. Other units have all the same attachments and weigh less. I wish that I would have purchased one of them. The only bonus was a 25 dollar discount for a first purchase oh and the free shipping. Can I just have my money back and buy a real unit? Good luck to all who buy The Bulky Boss!
1,"sucks, but not in a good way--HATE THIS VAC","Yeah, Eureka used to be a good brand. This vac is awful. Heavy, clumsy, tilt switch doesn't work without stomping on it. Switch for the brushes is stuck so that I can't turn the brushes off to do bare floors. Power paw is laughable. What a piece of dookie. Never again, Eureka. Hate, hate, hate this vac."
1,Eureka 4870,"This is the worse vacuum we have ever owned. We have no pets, nice carpets, minimal dirt. Every 2 months, we have to replace the belt--the most expensive belt on the belt rack in Wal-Mart--What a ripoff. Speaking of rip off, the belt, we found out, is plastic. When the next belt breaks (in 2 months) this piece of garbage they call the 4870 is heading out to the street for the garbage truck where it will feel at home. If you have money to waste, go right ahead and buy it."
3,"Meh, it's okay.","I've had this vacuum for several years. It was a gift; I probably wouldn't have bought it myself. It did a decent job for two years or so before I got a Shark and a Dyson. Now that I have those two, I won't ever tough the Eureka again. It's too darn heavy for a small-framed woman such as myself to lug up and down the stairs. Very heavy. The tools are weak - it wasn't usually worth the trouble it took to set them up.I considered the Eureka the best vacuum I'd owned until the Shark Navigator and Dyson DC14 came home. It was better than most of the junk out there, but with a German Shepherd dropping hair like crazy, it's easily bested by the newer technology."
2,product died after 7 months,"I bought this vacuum reconditioned, I expected it to last at least two years. Purchased on the 12th of November 2010 and on the 29th of June, 2011 the motor has overheated, and has caused the switch to melt. I wasn't too impressed with the job that the vacuum did after about two months. I couldn't afford to purchase another however. We own three pets, and they do shed. A bag would last exactly three weeks. Vacuuming our tile floor from the foyer to the kitchen daily, and the carpets every other day, certainly the machine was not over used. The hose is incredibly short making the job of vacuuming difficult, not to mention getting under furniture without having to literally pick up and move the furniture, forget it. I'll be looking for something portable, canister, and commercial grade. So unless you have tons of money to throw away, don't waste your money on this model."
4,Great Vacuum Cleaner,"The 4870GZ upright is a great vacuum cleaner - tremendous power and ease of operation. I was delighted with it's ability to really pull up the dirt. The only negative comment I have concerns weight - it is a heavy machine. But if you can accommodate that factor, then this vaccum is a terrific buy - and I highly recommend it."
4,First vacuum purchase,"We'd been using a hand-me-down from the college days, but it wasn't picking stuff up from the carpets. This is a huge improvement, with a couple of drawbacks: 1) it's very heavy (I have a bad back and my wife isn't athletic, and it's hard to take this up and down the stairs); 2) the hose attachment's flexible part is fairly short, then it has a long tube to extend (it would be better if the flexible part was longer)."
5,Best Vacuum for the Buck!!,This vacuum is the best I've had - can't understand some of the complaints in the reviews. It's not that heavy and has AWESOME sucking power. No drawbacks that I've experienced - Go for it!!!
3,"It's effective, but heavy & hard to assemble",Biggest pluses: the vacuum cleaner is powerful and reasonably priced.The vacuum cleaner is heavy. I have my husband carry it upstairs when I use it there.Assembly is not easy. I still can't figure out where some of the accessories are supposed to attach.Vacuum tends to blast dust backwards onto my feet.Customer service was friendly.
1,Thumbs down to consumer reports ratings,Broken brush roller after 1st use. Eureka service was poor at best. Waited 4 weeks for Eureka to replace it. Never received a replacment. Finaly I called Amazon. The only bright spot was Amazon had no problem with giving me a refund.
4,remember those old product assembly manuals?,"Great vacuum, great price. Actually I had not realized that this product fit the old saying 'some assembly required'. The manual (if you can call it that) had very small, hard to interpret drawings on how to put the pieces together. Actually the pieces went together nicely after all was said and done.Make sure to have a phillips screwdriver on hand, and be ready to not understand the manual. For example, 'Step 4' of the 'how to use' section says: ""Step 4: Cam Latch. To release clear tubes."" (What the heck kind of step is this? Is Cam some sort of verb I didn't know?)Eureka - if you are reading this - buy something (anything) from IKEA to see how manuals are written these days."
3,Not quite a Dyson....,"Consumer Reports rated this vacuum as better than a Dyson. Coming from a devoted household of Dyson users, I cannot say I would purchase this vacuum again. But, freshly out of college, I can't afford a $400 vacuum. The Boss is loud, vibrates, and sounds like it is gearing up for takeoff every time I use it on carpet. I also don't like vacuum bags. I like to see that my vacuum is working, and know immediately when to dump the dirt. Overall, yes it works well, and probably the best in the under $250 bracket, but if you can, go with the Dyson. The way this vacuum sounds makes me feel like I won't have it for long before it breaks; while the Dysons I've used have been around for years without incident. The attachments are also used more easily on the Dyson, as the hose is right there in the handle, with no settings to change should you need the hose. Anyways, I'll stick with this Boss until it breaks, then I'll be off to Dysonland."
4,Great Vacuum,"I too, purchased this vacuum based on CR recommendation. I am pleased with the suction, and I would have given it 5 stars, but the Power Paw attachment did not come with it. But I will say that Amazon's customer service is awesome. I was sure that I would be guided by endless voice prompts prior to speaking to an actual person, but I was pleasantly surprised when I spoke with Samantha almost immediately. She even said that she would call me in a couple of days to follow up on the issue. That's customer service."
4,"Great, but not perfect.","This vacuum has performed very well, and at the price paid (about $125) I doubt it could be beat. It is a bit heavy, and attachments work okay, but not exceptionally. Ours has picked up pounds of dog fur already, and I've been impressed with the filtering and non-clogging of the bristles."
4,Pretty good for the price range,The filter bags are easy to chage. It cleans well. Everyone in my family has allergies and we have no problems when cleaning with this vacuum. The only cons are - it is not very easy to change from bare floors to carpet and back. It is a bit clumsy.
4,Good Vac,"Bought this vac because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. It's what they said. Big and kind of bulky, but it really does suck up the dirt. Well worth the money."
3,18 month review,"Well I have to say when we got the 4870GZ it was great, but now after 18 months it won't do the same carpet we've had all along. I changed belts (twice) and tried everything I know (husband talking here) to make it work better, but the beater simply won't turn on our medium plush carpet, have always set the vacuum on ""HIGH"" which makes me wonder how people do when their carpet is thicker than ours. So, we're looking for a new vac in the same price range.I will say for the price we paid ($130) it was a great vac while it lasted.-H"
5,love it,bagless vacs are overrated - this old school vac actually does what its supposed to do and costs hundreds less than others of comparable quality.
4,Tremendous Suction,About 8 months ago I bought a hoover windtunnel for approx. $300.00. After a few months The power switch did not work and 8 months later the vacuum did not work at all. I was going to buy a dyson until after I read Consumer Report and then read alot of reviews from actual owners of this vacuum. I really love this vacuum. It has tremendous Suction power for pet hair and that was a must for me. It seems to be lighter and much quieter than my previous vacuums. I would have given it 5 stars except that there are two things I have a problem with. I wish the hose were longer and I have yet to figure out where the claw attachment fits on the vacuum when not in use. I would definitely recommend this vacuum. I learned a valuable lesson which is more expensive does not allways mean better quality.
4,Eureka 4870GZ Boss: pretty good...with flaws,"I've had this vacuum for 2 weeks now and have used it moderately. I am relatively pleased with it on many levels, however there are some annoyances and poor design features1) It has great suction (the best feature!), and the knob to switch from floor to hose cleaning is very convenient and easy to use. Attachments are good as well.2) Although it is quite heavy (compared to my earlier vacuums), it's not too bad to push around.3) The switch to turn the roller off/on is inconveniently located and can be difficult to push. Moreover, the foot lever to switch the vacuum from an upright position is cheap, and is very often difficult to disengage. You feel like it's going to break every time you trigger it, and you have to use your heel and push on it gently4) The hose will become dislodged if you vacumm too vigorously...maybe this is just me, but it's annoying...Otherwise, I'm glad I made the purchase and I hope it lasts!"
3,Six months later....off to get repaired,"I bought the Eureka Boss because it had great reviews, but honestly I wonder how many of these reviewers had their Boss for more than just a few weeks before reviewing. I have owned several vacuums. I have yet to find one that lasts longer than a year. I have 5 kids and a golden retriever, so maybe I just vacuum more often than the average household. I found this vacuum to be very heavy to carry up stairs. Also, the release lever is rediculously hard to release. You have to really almost stand on it to get it to release. It feels like you are going to break it...and indeed you will. The wheel on the same side of the release is busted off from having pressure applied one too many times. Thankfully, it is under warranty still. The attachments are very frustrating as they break easily and fall off the vacuum while in use. The Boss has very good suction. If it can't last longer than 6 months,however, I'm not sure how great it is after all."
5,Eureka Smart Boss Vacuum,This vacuum is wonderful and it was a great value. It has lots of power and it cleans much better than our Hoover Windtunnel. My 17 year old says it's awesome and she would vacuum her room anytime. Now that's a winner in my book!
2,"Very loud, very disappointing....","We purchased this vacuum on the recommendation of Consumer Reports (it's at the top of their lists) and here at Amazon (where it's generally rated quite highly). After several months of use on our carpet, we have been very disappointed with the results. The vacuum simply doesn't pick up dirt reliably on our carpet. Nor does it actually pick up the detritus from the carpet -- the fuzzy stuff seems to gather up and get stuck in the mechanism, even at the highest and lowest settings. I actually find that I spend more time kneeling on the carpet cleaning up after the vacuum than I do actually vacuuming. Needless to say, a great disappointment. It also happens to be quite loud -- but if the product worked well, we would certainly be able to overlook that."
1,Broke after just 10 uses !,"STAY AWAY from this model ! I thought I had thoroughly researched it, and I tend to believe Consumer Reports. So I fell for this and it broke after only 10 uses ! According to the repairman, the broken part was the Connector to the Thermo-Reset. Apparently this model vacuum is the one most often brought in for repairs. Other issues are: the heavy weight, the unavailability of replacement bags, and the complicated construction (a lot of layers).Save yourself the aggravation and do not buy this particular vacuum !If you are not convinced by me, please read the very long and detailed review by a vacuum repairman, which is included in the 1-star reviews here on Amazon. He tells you right away that this particular model vacuum is truly the one most often brought in for repairs !"
4,Powerful Suction,"I'm so glad I read other reviews before purchasing this product; I knew what others thought about the positives and negatives, and they were right on. It is a tad heavy, but I'm used to that, so that doesn't bother me. I just knew it would be a good workout for the upper body. But the suction is awesome--I think my floors and carpets are cleaner than they've been in years. For the price, I would highly recommend it to others."
3,disappointed product,Good: strong suction.Bad: 1) handle-release lever does not work from day-1. 2) Hard to get information on repair service from Eureka's customer support (both online and via phone). 3) Been waited for over 2 weeks for parts needed for repair!!I trusted the Consumer Report to make this purchase. CR should look at this product again!
5,Excellent Vacuum,"This vacuum works just as good as Consumer Reports said it did. I am very pleased with my purchase. Also, the replacement bags can be purchased at the local Walmart so that's easy!"
3,Eureka Boss Vacuum Cleaner,This product can really cleans well except it's pretty heavy. I have a hard time manuevering it from one place to the other. It makes me pretty tired aftera while. I should have bought one that is self profelled.
5,best little vacuum in Oregon,"I reviewed the Consumer Reports and purchased this vacuum based on their report and the consumer reviews here. SO GLAD I DID! The suction on this vacuum is impressive. I can definitely say this is the best vacuum I have ever owned. We have 3 cats and 1 dog, and most vacuums just can't handle all that hair, but this one does like a champ! I can even vacuum the tassels on my oriental rug without them getting tangled in the machine!The only negative is that the foot pedal to release the handle is stiff. A very MINOR negative!!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This is my first Eureka Vacuum and I have to say after reading consumer reports and the reviews at amazon I have made the right choice. This vacuum has excellent suction power and it is a bit heavy but not enough where it was a real concern. I vacuumed my whole house twice and needed to replace the bags twice, that just goes to show you how poor a job my other vacuum was doing. If your looking for a clean dust free house, then this is the vacuum for you. The only draw back is unfortunaly the power paw did not work as well as I expected just after one use on my stairs it broke. I ordered a replacement and lets see how that one will work, other than that its a great machine.What do you have to loose? You have a 30 day guarantee! Try it, you wont be sorry."
3,The best vacuum ever - if you have the strength to push it.,"I just got this vacuum and love everything about it; yet I will be returning it because it is far too heavy. The suction is awesome which adds to the drag of trying to push it. Some ot the things that impressed me most: 1) It has a switch that directs the suction from the floor to the hose - it's so easy! 2) There is NO exhaust, no dusty smell, and the vacuum itself does not become dusty. On the con side: All of the switches (roller height adjustment, handle adjustment, airflow switch etc...) are plastic and don't easily turn. I get the feeling they might break. I would take that risk and keep the vacuum, though, if only it weren't so heavy and therefore difficult to use. I'm looking to trade this in for one of the light weight Eurekas instead."
4,Great Vacuum,"I read the reviews and bought this vacuum to replace a Hoover Twin chamber bagless that I had. It is so much quieter and is definitely more powerful. Bag changes are easy without all of the dust flying around like with my Bagless. It is a little heavier, but it doesn't bother me that much. My only complaint is that one of the attachments keeps falling off the unit. I just threw it in the pantry--I know where it is when I want to use it. The hose is also a little short, but my stairs are split into two half-flights, so it works perfect for me. I could see difficulties if you wanted to use it on one long flight of stairs and you had trouble lifting/balancing 20 lbs while you were vacuuming. The claw attachment cleans the dog hair off my furniture like magic! The hose on this machine really has incredible suction--I have never seen one that does so well."
2,carpet brush does not turn off,"I gave the vacuum as a Christmas Gift. The suction is really good, however the carpet brush will not disengage to do bare floors. I selected this model primarily to do both types of floors. I have been having trouble getting in contact with Eureka, but will keep trying.............more later"
3,Rated good but with reservations,"This sweeper does an excellent job of cleaning, but it is extremely heavy and extremely noisy. I would choose another vacuum - I plan to keep it a couple of years and then replace."
3,Ease of asembly and use,"I found this product to be well constructed, and easy to assemble. BUT, I am having difficulty when using on carpet, as the brush roller is too low, and creates a lot of drag when pulling back towards me. It is almost self-propelled, when pushing forward. How do I retract the brush so it is easier to operate?"
2,Way to heavy,"I have owned this vacuum for over 2 years and enjoyed it at first. It has great suction and the hands tools are nice. But now, the hose for the hand tools has split open. And it seems like every time I use it, it grows more heavy to work with. So if you have any issues with upper body strength at all, pass this vacuum up - it is monstrously heavy! It is also very loud and blows hot air right where you hold it onto the base to use it on the stairs.There are too many issues with this vaccum for me to recommend it...particularly when I am looking to replace my investment after only 2 years."
1,"When it works, great. But, it is ALWAYS being repaired!","Purchased this vacuum after reading some great consumer report reviews. We've owned it for a year and a half now. I'm constantly pulling it apart and getting new roller caps from Eureka because they are constantly melting. When it's working, it's great, but be ready for regular repairs! I'd have rather spent another $100 and had a quality, lasting vacuum."
3,"Pleased with carpet clean up, but not at all with hard wood floor...","This vacuum does an excellent job on carpet in my home. We have two dogs that shed a lot a it did not take much to fill up the bag with our large two story home. It worked great on the carpet! However, the switch to move it to hard wood floors does not work. I had read this in a previous review also. We have a lot of area to cover in hard wood floors and I was looking forward to not having to sweep as much. Very upset that this function is faulty and the switch will not stay put on hard wood floor. The brushes continue to roll not making it possible to clean adequately on hard wood floors.Besides that glitch, the vacuum is excellent and I did not notice a problem with heaviness. I just did not feel like having to re-ship back to manufacturer and go another week without a vacuum so keeping my broken one : ("
2,Disappointing,"This vacuum has good suction and comes in a light package with an easily replaceable HEPA filter; it is easy to assemble. However, it arrived pre-broken -- the floor switch, which disengages the rollers -- did not work, and it had a cheap feel overall. Controls were not in sensible places and the extension hoses were difficult to deal with. It took very little time for me to return it to its original container and send it back. I came to the conclusion that vacuums are something you at least look at in person."
2,Took broken one back only to find second one broken as well,"Don't purchase this machine if you need to use it on hardwood floors. I got the machine home and liked how it worked on my carpets. Tried to switch off the brushrollers for use on my hardwood floors and the switch was broken. Took the VC back to the store and, with high hopes, brought home another one -- same type. Alas, the brushroller switch on this new one was broken, too!!!Not going back a third time!! Looking at some higher priced brands made by entities with histories of producing reliable machines (e.g., Hoover, Kenmore). This exerience has turned me off to Eureka. Buyer beware.Lorie"
1,another junk vaccum,"bought this vaccum a year ago and true to form of previous vaccums i've bought it lasted a year. i bought it based on customer reviews, which were good,but i needed to give it the one year test,and it failed.it now won't keep a belt more than a week. plus it is also losing suction. on the good side the lite still works!"
1,Worst vacuum I've ever owned,"I've had this vacuum for about a year now and when I run out of bags, it's on to the land fill where it belongs. I can't begin to figure out how so many people liked this vacuum. If I could have given it a lower rating, I would have. About the only thing good I can say about it is it has above average suction. All I can say is go try one out before you buy."
1,came broken,i sent this to a friend as a gift but it came broken; an embarrising situation. Bec. he recieved it in a different town i could do nothing but leave him with a broken vac and the headache of having to deal with u or eureka to repair it. very unsatisfying experience. do i have any recourse? thanx so much for you consideration of this matter. yehoshua krohn
3,Eureka Boss Smart Vacuum # 4870,"Eureka Boss Smart Vac Model 4870: an excellent vacuum.However,it is very heavy,hard to move around,not easy to use the release foot pedal,and the disposable bag replacement method is difficult.The disposable bag fills up very quickly,so you will need frequent replacements,which are difficult to find in retail outlets,and if ordered by phone or mail,the shipping charges are ridiculous.A mixed bag(no pun intended)."
5,Eureka 4870GZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright Vacuum,This vacuum works wonderfully. The price is exceptional low considering the quality of this machine.
3,Eureka !!! I did it,Very easy to assemble when I received it in the package. Picks up really well. A little hard to push. Very heavy device. I'm please with the performance.
1,Worst vaccum I have ever owned.,"Might be OK for carpet but not for hard or laminate floors. The exhaust blows right out of the front of the unit and it just blows the floor dust into a cloud before passing over it.The lever to connect/disconnect the brush was almost impossible to work, and the lever to lower the handle into vacuuming position was very hard to activate.Look for something else."
2,Great suction...but still disappointed!,"I bought this 6 months ago based on reviews. On the plus side, it does have great suction for carpet and is a good price for what you get. However, for me the negatives outweigh these positives. First, the suction is definitely poor when using the tubes and attachments and I do not feel it works well at all on hard floors. Also, it is VERY hard to flip the switch on the bottom to change it from carpet use to vacuuming on bare floors. I read that this would loosen up with use, but mine has not at all. Also, the vacuum is VERY heavy. The way the handle is designed it is really, really difficult to carry up and down stairs. The parts are all plastic and already I have two parts broken off on mine. I think this machine would be best for someone who is very strong, will only be using it on carpet, and for those who live on one floor."
2,It was good while it lasted,"I bought this vacuum in early 2006 and it is now dead. I didn't use it all that much, maybe once or twice a month as my cleaning lady does the vacuuming (no pets either). I did like it when I did use it. It had great suction, it was self-propelled and overall did a good job. I had the other problems some other reviewers had with the handle release that was hard to push but that didn't seem like a big deal. 2 weeks ago, while vacuuming, the thing made a loud noise and just turned off. The smell was pretty bad too. I took it to a local repair shop and he just laughed. Said the plastic motor was shot and that it wasn't worth repairing. He said that some Eureka's are good vacuums you just have to make sure it's not one with a plastic motor. Too bad the warranty was only a year."
5,Fantastic vacuum!!!!,"We bought this vacuum for pet hair when our Hoover failed to do the trick. It is fantastic!!!!!!!!! The price is wonderful, and it was sent super quickly!! I love it!!!!!!!"
4,The Boss,I've had the Eureka 487GZ vac for a couple of weeks now and overall am quite impressed with it. It works really well but I'm sorta disappointed in how loud it is during operation. I often wear ear plugs. Has anyone else noticed this????
2,Good suction; too heavy,"I ordered the Eureka Boss Smart Upright vacuum based on reviews by customers as well as other sites. While the suction is great, the machine is extremely heavy to push and use. I found it gave me a backache and was not worth the physical strain to keep the machine."
3,Sweeper Review,"We have already called Eureka to get a replacement roller brush for this sweeper. The sweeper is not as quiet as I thought it might be from the Consumer Reports. Of course, it might be quieter after the brush is replaced. The sweeper does have good suction with the hoses."
3,When did everything become plastic?,"This is our first new vacuum in 20 years and I guess I shouldn't be surprised that almost everything about this vacuum is plastic. It has a few ergonomic bugs like the on-off button is down on the container, not up by the handle. Also the foot release button, to allow the upright portion of the vacuum to recline into the vacuuming position, is a bit of a bugger. And lastly there is a flip switch for hardwood floors that I cannot get to work right. It's probably me not following directions, which I never read, but it should be simpler.All that being said, it works really well as a vacuum."
4,Only half right,"This was the first time I had ordered anything significant on-line.Everything went well with the order, and I received two vacuum cleanerswithin about one week. However, they were given as Christmas gifts, andwhen put together one of the two did not work. So, you know the rest. Itwas a hassle to disassemble, ect., but you handled sending it back withefficiency: within one day UPS picked the defective one up and accordingto your update e-mail, I should be receiving it within the next day or two.So, overall I feel very good about the order, hoping next time all theitems will work the first time around."
4,Boss Smart Vac REview,This is a powerful vacuum cleaner. it really sucks.The only bad thing about it is that it is quite heavy.
1,Loved this vacuum so much I bought it twice... both times it broke after 18 months,This is a great vacuum. Great suction and the self propel feature is wonderful. I loved this vacuum so much that after my first one had multiple trips to the repair shop and finally stopped working; I bought another one ~ thinking it was just a fluke. Now that my second Boss has broken I am done with this vacuum. I hope you all have better luck.
4,GREAT VACUUM,"Vacuum has a lot of power! I did research and consumer information did recommend this vacuum. However, the vacuum I received from Amazon's supplier did have some mechanical problems. I had to take it to the repair shop within a week of purchase. (Repair cost covered by manufacturer) I am hoping that the bad connection is the only problem that will occur. It is truly an amazing cleaning tool. Amazon is willing to swap it out if I have another problem.So, don't worry. Be HAPPY! And clean your house! :)"
4,Excellent Change,"I purchased this vacuum after installing new carpet. My old vacuum would not pick up the ""dust bunnies"" from the carpet. This did it, and was very nice to hear the dirt it was picking up. Easy to move and have had no issues. Would suggest this product."
2,This really sucks,I purchased this vacuum because it was top rated by consumer reports. I cleans very well however you would have to buy 3 or 4 of them to keep one running and you will need the spare parts. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Great vacuum for the money,"The vacuum is great. It has all the additional tools needed, plus an additional attachment to remove pet hair."
5,Great Vacuum,"I really like this vacuum for rooms that have both hardwood and carpets. It is very simple to change from one surface to another. Also the attachments are very easy to use. I would not recommend this vacuum for stairs I found it difficult to use. But, I purchased this vacuum because I was tired of carrying my old vacuum up and down the stairs. Now I leave the old one upstairs and this one is perfect for downstairs. Comsumer Report give this vacuum a good review. I liked this vacuum so much I got my daughter one."
4,Eureka 4870GZ Sweeper Review,This is the second 4870 sweeper we have purchased. This was a gift for our daughter. We bought ours as it was a Consumer's Reports Best Buy and have been very pleased. Highly recommended
5,Rave reviews for the Boss Smart-Vac,"The Boss is the best, most powerful, vacuum cleaner I have owned. I have had an Electrolux and a Hoover Windtunnel. The Boss is light, easy to operate, and the suction is fantastic. The price is much cheaper than the others. I receive Consumer Reports each month and the Boss Smart-Vac was rated as one of their top picks. I can see why. You will not be dissapointed."
4,IT'S THE BOSS,"After having tried several uprights this is the one. Four pets, both hard wood and carpeted floors and the cleaner transitions nicely. Very pleased"
4,Great Price for a Heavy Vacuum,"Great price for a quality vacuum. It vacuums great. The bags are easy to find. As it is rather heavy; it is well suited for a ranch style house. The open handle does make it easier to lift. The cord is located low on the machine, so if you drop it you will have to bend to the floor to pick it up (or hook it with a foot and lift it up if you're that flexible). It seams that the engineers forgot to include the switch into the design; on the up side you can go to your local electronics shop and find the same exact switch if it ever breaks.Some assembly required . . . you will need a Phillips screwdriver to attach the handle to the body."
4,a great sucker,"I like that this vaccum is quieter than any other upright that I've owned and that it sucks really well, both on carpet and tile floors. The only complaint that I have is that the latch to make the roller stop rolling for use on non-carpet floors is not easy to get into the mode and doesn't always work. Just takes some getting used to."
4,Pretty Darn Good Vacuum!,I LOVE the versatility of the Eureka 4870GZ vacuum. I only wish the hose attachment was a bit longer to reach all the nooks and crannies when I use it to vacuum out my car - which I have to do more often than I would like! Otherwise it is a super machine - and easy to assemble and use!
3,Good suction however; heavy to use,"The vacuum has good suction and cleans well; however, the unit is very heavy and not easily maneuvered. It is somewhat difficult to handle."
1,Bad Boss,"This vacuum is hard to manuever, and clumsy. Was a Consumer Report best buy...they were wrong. The cord is too low on the body, gets in the way unless held. The dial to switch from brush to hose is a tight turn, height adjustment not accurate and the vacuum is heavy, heavy. Does not go under even high profile furniture. Cannot use on even heavy large area rugs without ""stalling."" Return to neutral position or foot pedal to vacuum difficult to use without a lot of force. Bad purchase on my part."
2,Eureka,Based off the reviews that I have read concerning this product I was disappointed in the quality. The handle release is very difficult to operate. When cleaner height setting is not in the highest position brush roller stops working periodically. Attachment storage locations are very incovenient and attachments fall off while vacuuming.
2,real problems with the motors,"Bought the vacuum cleaner at a great rate from an amazon store front great people to deal with. The cleaner started out great then a pop and nothing. Went on line to an authorized Eureka dealer and spoke with an associate. Took it to the site they recommended and found out that the motor had burned out. Seems this is a real problem with the vacuum as many have been replaced with new motors. The associate (off the record) said it was junk. All plastic, not well made. I bought this cleaner on others opinions and was greatly suprised with what I did get. Needless to say I am now out of a vacuum for a few weeks for repair especially since I live 75 miles from an authorized dealer to repair it. I would think again before I bought another."
4,Good vacuum for the money,"This machine has good suction, and the power roller brush really digs out the dirt. The accessories are easy to get out and use. The filters catch the dirt and dust, so there's no coughing while using it.Two complaints: The special tool for carpets isn't worth bothering with; and to get to the roller brush, you have to take out three screws, rather than undoing clips or something easier.Other than that, I'd recommend this machine."
5,NIce Vac Overall,"This vacuum is wonderful. It has great power and picks everything up super good! It is a bit heavy, but not so bad wear you'll hurt yourself. The attachemnts work just fine, but you can forget the Paw Attachment (useless in my opinion).The surprising thing is how quiet it is compared to other vacs this size. I can still talk to my wife or kids and they can hear me as well as I can hear them just fine, all without shouting or having to turn the vacuum off.Overall we are pleased with it....and also, it picks up dog hair great!"
3,"great vacuum, impossible to buy replacement bags","We really love this vacuum, but now that we have used the bags that came with the vacuum we are having a VERY difficult time finding a store that carries the bags. On-line vendors do carry the bags, but I have yet to find anyone that charges less than $5 to ship the bags (which cost from $3 to $10 for 3 bags, depending on where you shop). I would not purchase another Eureka product for this reason. It does not matter how well it works or how easy it is to use if you cannot get the parts you need for a reasonable price."
2,Dust only please,"Consumer reports rates this unit as a best buy but be warned...if your carpet has anything other than dust in it, find another vacuum cleaner. Most carpets tend to accumulate a mixed bag of dirt and other foreign objects like scraps of paper, paper clips, etc. My nephew ran over a woodscrew which caused to motor to smoke. I spent more time dislodging foreign objects from this thing than actual vacuuming. The stuff you find under most couch cushions would completely destroy this thing. I'm told that this is the case of most uprights but our hoover lasted 10 years before we retired it. I doubt that I'll get 10 uses out of this thing. I would strongly suggest scouring your carpet for coins, nails and other foreign objects before use....and an iron clad warranty."
3,Pretty good for the money.,"This vacuum picks up dirt pretty well and comes with adequate attachments. The down side is that the attachment hose could be longer and the vacuum could be lighter. It's about 20 pounds. Also, I haven't found the replacement bags to be readily available in local stores. Either this is a very popular vacuum and they're always out of the bags, or its one of those stupid situations where I'll have to order more directly from Eureka."
4,Wow! What a great Vacuum,"I purchased this vacuum within the last few months. I can honestly say, it's the best I have ever had!! I was embarassed at the dirt that was in my rugs, but I am very pleased with it. Power and durability are there. For the price, it's a winner."
5,Great Price,"After seeing this in Consumer Reports, this was the vacuum for my son! It was a great present."
4,Could improve a few things,"I like this vacuum, it does a good job vacuuming.The few things I would change would be;Needs a longer hose.Handle should adjust for taller people, like me.The recline pedal should work much smoother.Could be more streamlined.Other than that it's great."
4,Eureka's Boss Vacuum Works Well,I am very happy with my new vacuum. It makes vacuuming easy again. It has done very well at picking up all kinds of dirt and pet hair on all surfaces. It is a great vacuum that is easy to use.
4,Katti,Great upright vacumn with great cleaning power. Only regret the upright is not bagless. Amazon supplier was great...fast delivery and box arrived as if it was just taken off the inventory shelf!Eureka 4870GZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright Vacuum
4,Great for pet hair!,"I have 3 cats in my apartment; their hair has been a major problem for me for years and I desperately needed a reliable vacuum that could get the hairs that were embedded into the carpets. I did research online and found that this vacuum was one of the best for pet hair removal--and it really is amazing! It gets out the embedded cat hairs, and even ""fluffs up"" the flattened, high-traffic parts of my carpet. It also comes with different hose attachments so I can clean corners with ease--which is one of my favorite things to do now that I can. I love this vacumm, and I wish I'd purchased one sooner.The only downside is that it's heavy, and the hose is not very long. But these are only minor things compared to the benefits of having a clean, cat hair-free home."
4,Great Vacuum for the Price!,Great job picking up on hard surfaces and carpet. Hose works great too. Attachments including the claw is great. Only a few issues 1) bag is very small and fills fast-buy many 2)The lever to release the arm to push the vacuum is hard to press with foot. I frequently have use my hand to press the lever.
4,Eureka 4870GZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright Vacuum,"Great vacuum, cleanest my floors have been. Must monitor the fan belt for slipping after changing modes from carpet to bare floors and back."
5,Eureka!,So far my husband and I have been very pleased. It does a wonderful job on our carpets. The vacuum definitely feels solid and well built.
5,Great Vacuum for the Money,"We bought this model based on the Consumer Reports article which rated it as the best vacuum under $300. It works perfectly. We both have long hair, as well as three cats, and it keeps our carpets and upholstery spotless."
3,Eureka vacuum,Does a good job of cleaning but is very heavy and awkward to handle. The release to lower the handle is hard to use. Not for an older person or someone who can't lift alot of weight.
5,GREAT VALUE!,"This was the vacuum I've been looking for! After wasting money on cheaper brands, I read the reviews on this one and decided to take a chance. I was not disappointed. As others have pointed out, the suction is fantastic. I'm pulling things out of my carpet that I couldn't imagine. It really propels iteself too, making it easy to manuever. Others have commented on the weight of the vacuum, but I don't think it's any heavier than other models. I highly recommend the Boss!"
1,Consumer Reports Got This One Wrong,"Contrary to the high rating in Consumer Reports, this vacuum cleaner was a bust. We matched it next to our 10-year-old Hoover, and it failed miserably. The Eureka did not pick up animal hair very well from a rug, which was the main reason we purchased it. Had to send it back because the product just didn't work as claimed. If you have pets, don't buy this vacuum."
2,Heavy vacuum,"This vacuum works great, but it weighs a ton. It's very difficult to maneuver throughout the house. I have to switch from carpet to bare floor in just about every room and the handle will not stay up. It's constantly falling over and good luck if it hits your foot. I wish I had bought another Oreck like the one I lost in Katrina, but I couldn't afford it at the time. I consider myself pretty strong, and I really hate vacuuming with this thing."
2,Not all what Consumer Reports said,"When the vacuum arrived the belt to drive the brush worked intermitently to not at all right out of the box. I took it to a local warranty shop (to avoid the re-packaging hassle)and they had to bend a plastice piece that controlled the belt tension. They said it happens often on this model. Their advice was buy local, I now believe that."
3,"Good, but LOUD",This vacuum really works well & picks up the dirt VERY Well. However it is EXTREMELY loud!
5,My Vacuum Sucks-finally :),"I finally have a vacuum that has enough suction to make you feel like the floor is clean. I was a bit afraid to get it because of back issues and several reviews said it was hard to pull back. So far, it's been fine, although I haven't done the whole house at once yet.I like being able to remove the suction from the floor when you are using the hose by twisting a switch. Hose is powerful, too. I can't say I'm enjoying vacuuming now, but it's certainly better than before!"
1,The Boss is squeeky and irritating to use,"I bought this vacuum because Consumer Reports tagged it a ""best buy"" Well, not for me. I hated the way it's made. It squeeks when you push it, it's hard to use the attachments and is clumsy and heavy to use. The switch that stops the beater bar for hard floor cleaning is on the bottom of the unit, but you have to bend over and switch it by hand, you can't use your foot. And the switch is hard to move, I thought it wasn't working, but I just hadn't pushed it hard enough. It hurt my fingers. It may really clean the floor well, but it sure is a pain in the #@$% to use."
4,Excellent vacuum and great value * * * *,"I have been very happy with the Eureka 4870GZ. I does an excellent job cleaning carpet and the easy control to switch to the hose makes cleaning hard floors easy as well. The machine is quite heavy but I do not hind it a problem, might be tough for kids to use. I would not recommend if you have lots of hard floors. Get a canister!I had one small problem as I unpacked the vacuum. The hose extension pieces were stuck together and would not come apart, ultimately they broke trying."
1,disappointment,"I purchased this vacuum because it was a consumer reports best buy. I found it very difficult to use. The foot pedal release was very hard to use, and moving the vacuum while in use was not easy. It came missing part of the telescopic tube, and an attachment that would not attach properly to the vacuum when not in use. I returned this product right away."
3,Gave mine away,"Pay close attention to the weight and measurements. The thing is a behemoth. If you like SUVs, then you might be ok with it, but don't plan on getting in any tight corner, etc. I did really like the directional dial to switch from floor to hose (which is a great way to lessen suction on the fly by diverting it to the other source), and I liked the transparent hose (came in real handy once when I sucked up a too-large piece of paper), but the thing just killed my arms and lugging it to our 2nd floor was a major hassle. I gave it to my son for his apt. I ended up with a cannister. When my son saw the 4870GZ, he went, ""Whoa, overkill."""
5,Eureka is the best!,"Vacuum has great suction power. It is easy to switch from carpet to bare floor to use without the brush roller, and easy to switch to use hose attachments. Filtering and bags all seems to work great. I am very please with this vacuum's ability to pick up everything in its path on the first pass."
3,Eureka 4870GZ Solid Performer,"If you are looking for an economical machine to get your carpet clean this machine does the job. I find it to be heavy, which is consistent with the reviews that I read before making my purchase. Also, the lever to lower the handle is stiffer than I'd like, it works best if wearing shoes. Over-all a solid performer. I paid 109 with free shipping and applying my discount for getting an Amazon credit card. You probably won't find something that works better for less."
3,Eureka Smart Vac,The vacuum has lots of power and I like the way it cleans . . it's just soooo heavy. It also has no way of checking how full it is without removing the cover. Removing the bag is also very awkward and its difficult to do so without spraying dust everywhere.
4,Great vacuum for the money,"After years of bad luck with Hoover Windtunnels and recently purchasing a Kenmore in which I returned because it just stopped, I decided to buy the vacuum that was the least expensive, but highly rated by Consumer Reports. This vacuum really is impressive. It isn't too heavy and the suction works great to pick up dirt deep in my carpet.The only things I don't care for is the upholstery tool which I find pretty much worthless. I can do more with the other tools and get better results. Also, the tools tend to fall off the back as well as the hose becomes unattached from its holder. These are things I can live with since the price is so much lower than other vacuums. I am very happy with the Eureka."
3,The boss is Bruce,The vac was a snap to put together and get running. It's a little on the heavy side but it rolls easy. The included tiger paw attachment works ok on smooth fabric but not so great on thick carpet. The handle needs another grab point to carry it up the steps without bending over. The grab handle by the hepa filter is where I hold it to do the steps. It blows out very hot air and is not easy to hold the vac in this position. The vac cleans extremely well and the hepa system is airtight. The handle release is awkward and hard to push and the on off swith is in a poor place. I like this vac but don't love it.
3,heavy,"Vacuum is heavy to push, since the motor is in the upright part and not at the base. It vacuums well but is hard to maneuver. Had to call customer service to see how to switch to bare floor. (Push yellow lever really hard!)"
5,Great Vacuum,"This vacuum is the best. Works great on hardwood floors and the attachments are attached to the vacuum. The extra long cord makes it easy to move from one location to another. AFter comparing many models, I am happy we purchased this one."
3,Unhappy,"There is undoubtedly a great deal of power in this vacuum. BUT it is very heavy, more like an industrial than a household appliance. It is clumsy to maneuver and its plastic controls require extra strength to operate. For example, to press the pedal that controls the machine one needs SHOES with thick soles! It is convenient that it is also a canister, but the dial that controls it requires a lot of strength. In other words this is not for the average home user. If I could I would definitely return it in exchange for something lighter and more friendly."
4,"Great Vacuum Power, Poor Design","This vacuum does a great job of cleaning my floors. My house is probably 70% carpet and 30% tile floors and is one level. I do not think this vacumm is as heavy, as mentioned in earlier reviews. That comment alone made me hesitant to purchase it, but I found the vacumm moves easily.A couple of design flaws that I don't care for are the pedal you need to step on to actually pull the handle back to move the vacuum. It's tight and in an awkward place, that is just begging to get broken quickly. Next is the hose. It doesn't wrap tight enough around the pegs to keep if from coming lose and getting in the way. A third nuisance is that the plug doesn't fit tight enough into the wall outlet to prevent it from coming unplugged. Then there is the ""telescoping"" handles that I haven't yet mastered on how to use them easily.I think the vacumm does a great job of picking up the dirt. It's the above mentioned flaws that are irksome and slows down the cleaning."
5,Great Vacuum!,"We were unexpectedly away from our home for 6 weeks and left three shedding cats in the care of a neighbor. We came home to a very furry abode. This vacuum took care of everything! It nearly filled a bag with cat fur (eek!). We have 2 young kids (2 yrs and 4 mos), so we really need a vacuum that sucks well. This more than takes care of all the dirt, dust, fur, that we bring into the house and leaves our carpet looking new again. However, beware, this vacuum will suck up anything and everything that comes near it. Small toys, shoe laces, straps, socks, etc, will disappear if not removed prior to vacuuming. It is heavy, but also realize that you get what you pay for. It works well, and will last (my mom has had one for 4 years). I appreciate how well it cleans, but if you don't like to heft a large vacuum, perhaps this isn't for you."
1,not for hardwood floors,"I do not recommend this vac for hardwood floors (or any floors for that matter). i've owned it for 2 years and I can barely use it because it's so noisy and unruly to use. It's rather spastic on carpet and rugs. the power brush is waaay to powerful, and ended up dragging me around the floor. also cheap construction -- not a long lasting product. it's inexpensive b/c it's not worth it."
2,Too heavy and not user friendly,"I bought this vacuum after reading the reviews. I should have listened to the reviewers who said this vacuum is ""too heavy!"" It is not only very heavy, but bulky too. You cannot get it into small places or vacuum under anything (chairs, beds) because the front is so big. I really regret buying this vacuum cleaner and hope that it lives a short life so I can throw it out and buy a new one.If anyone is interested in taking it off my hands, I'm willing to give it to you for half price."
4,This Vacuum Sucks!!,"This is a powerful vacuum. If you have any area rugs it will literally lift them off the floor. So it does the job it is suppose to do very well. It is a little heavy and pressing the release lever to start vacuuming is kind of difficult (it sticks sometimes). But for the price this is great, a much better value than the Dyson (my mother-in-law has one and frankly I think they are overrated)."
1,Spend more money,"I bought this vacuum a year ago after reading all these positive reviews and I disagree completely with these reviews. This thing is heavy, cheap and I would never buy it again. The whole vacuum exudes cheapness from the footswitch to the cord holder(that doesn't work) I can't wait till it dies and I can buy something better. Save your money for another month and buy something decent."
5,this one is tops !,"If you are looking for the top performing vacumn, that happens to be rather inexpensive, look no further. If it had a drawback, it would be that the strong suction sometimes takes some extra care with the carpet. It feels like it is going to suck the color out. The Consumer Reports pick was well-deserved."
1,Not that great!,Extremely difficult to release from upright position as is switching from floor to carpet. Would not buy another.
4,Great Vacuum,"I have the green colored one, but I think it is the same as the red one. It is heavy and sometimes the suction is so strong I can't move it across my Rug. But if I adjust the level it seems to work better. I have used a Dyson and I Know for a fact this vacuum is better. Dyson does lose suction, my Mom has one and it can't vacuum worth a darn anymore. It is horrible. I love this vacuum, it cleans well, but I don't like that is is so heavy and that it is hard to push across the carpet at times. I have broken the belt once because it sucked up a sock so I had to replace the belt. Just be aware it really sucks everything up, so you have to make sure nothing is in it's way!"
5,The best vacuum for your money,"Simply put I like this vacuum a lot! It's very powerful and quiet, the carpet looks so nice when you are done. I have a big German Shepperd and he sheds a lot during Summer time, this vacuum takes care of that problem. I only wish that it could be bagless like my old vacuum cleaner, but the trade off is so worth it in my opinion."
1,"Do not buy, not worth for money","I had this UREKA vacuuum for 1.5 years and it gave trouble after 8-10 months. First the brush rotated but no suction. You have to give it rest for 1-2 hours and when the motor cooled down, it worked again. Today after doing 2 rooms only the whole component died. I put that to rest but not sure whether it will awake again. I do not recommend UREKA to anybody. Just not worth it."
1,awkward says it best,"Yes, the vacuum does the vacuuming part just fine, but there are four extremely irritating features about this machine that make it frustrating. First, the vacuum hose refuses to stay inside the channel where it snakes around the back side of the body. That means that the loose hose is always in the way and in need of rehanging on the clips. Second, there is no reasonable way to handle this heavy machine in order to do stairs. The handle is awkward and because there's no hold on the bottom area, doing stairs is next to impossible. Third, the electrical cord attaches at the bottom of the vac and is always in the way, unless you want to hold that cord in one hand while pushing with the other. Fourth, the foot release on the left side is very resistant so that getting the handle into the working position is...again, awkward and frustrating. For me, the vacuums Ereka was making 20 years ago were far superior. The Boss Smartvac is far from what I would call smart."
1,Save yourself the aggravation - DO NOT BUY,"I bought this vacuum a little over a year ago online. I read the reviews and when someone said it was comparable to a Dyson, I figured it must be a winner. I bought a Eureka canister vac about 20 yrs ago and it lasted so long that I thought I could trust in the name. Fast forward: Both rubber coverings on the wheels have fallen off. Crazy glue has to be reapplied every so often to keep them on. The hose doesn't sit in it's spot on the back, so I had to put velcro around it so that I can take it on and off. Plus, it is the heaviest vacuum I have ever used. Forget about using it on stairs. Bottom line - don't be fooled by the expert reviews. Take the advice of a real life working mother who bought online to save a trip to the store and ultimately MADE A BIG,HEAVY,DISAPPOINTING MISTAKE."
2,loved it when I first got it- didn't last 2 years!,"When I first bought this vacuum during the summer of 2008, I loved the way it cleaned- suction was awesome.... Bags are practically impossible to find in stores- and now I have a box of them I can't use! I vacuum almost every day and have 3 boys and a dog- yep, pretty hard on it.. the hose detached from the attachment end (even duct tape won't hold it- I have to phyically hold the hose to make the suction- and today the engine blew up. I had tried contacting Eureka in the past with NO response, so I'm not even going to try again... another year of finding a good vacuum and another vacuum in a land fill!"
1,fell apart after 1 year,"I have owned this vacuum for just over a year (just past the warranty) and am extremely disappointed in its ability to stay functional. The rubber covering on the wheels has completely worn away. The dust wand attachment broke. And most importantly the handle now gets so hot while using the vacuum that you have to be careful not to burn yourself. The ""last straw"" started yesterday when the on/off switch stopped working and I have to start/stop the machine via the plug!!When I contacted the company they sent me a form letter response that there are ""no design flaws"" in their product and I should take it in for repair. Well, the service repair is likely to cost half of the original price of the machine.We have a normal size house and use the vacuum about once a week. I have never had a vacuum wear out so quickly.I will be ordering a new vacuum from another company."
1,Worst vaccum by far,I bought this vacuum because Consumer reports claimed it as the best. It didn't work on hardwood floors at all...just pushed the dirt around. It barely picked up debris on the carpet. The kick plate was so hard to push that I had to put sneakers to push it in and to release the handle. Stay away from this one!
5,Eureka! I love it!,"Awesome! It works great. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the cord doesn't retract on its own. Other than that, it's great. Plus the price wasn't bad either."
1,"Flimsy, bad quality.",Item was received broken. Cheap thin plasticAlthoughThanks for taking it back Amazon. I appreciate the hassle free pick up return service
4,Good but..,Required a bag...this causes more pollution and expense. It is very big and heavy. Go bagless.
1,"Broke down, doesn't clean pet hair and smells","At first, this seemed to be a great vacuum cleaner. For the first few months it cleaned great and I had no problems. Within a year, the vacuum started to have repair issues and wasn't cleaning pet hair well. After 2 years the bristles no longer spin at all and it isn't worth cost to repair. My previous vacuum was an Oreck which lasted about 10 years... I would not recommend this vacuum unless you'd like to replace it every two years. Also, it's a bit heavy when compared to the Oreck."
4,Powerful vacuum cleaner,This is a very powerful vacuum cleaner with lots of useful attachments. The only drawback is that it is extremely heavy.
4,"A Bit Large, But Does The Job","Overall, a great buy for the money. The Eureka 4870GZ has great suction, however it is rather bulky. It is not difficult to push and almost seems to be self propelled. The large size is the only real problem. Again, a good buy for the $$."
5,excellent vacuum,I purchased this vacuum after reading several reviews. So far I am extremely pleased with its performance. It has excellent suction and does well on carpet as well as hardwood. It even picks up that hard to get kitty litter from linoleum. It has a nice assortment of attachments and the power paw is extremely useful on the furniture. this is by far the nicest vacuum that I have owned. The only complaints that I have set the height adjustment is moderately hard to turn and it is fairly heavy. Other than that it is an excellent vacuum.
3,Specs and reviews are good but too heavy without self-propulsion,"I bought this but had to return it after trying it because it hurt my back with each stroke when I pulled it back (pushing was easy because the roller is so strong it pulls the vacuum forward). I have used a Hoover self-propelled upright for so many years that I got used to that almost effortless back and forth. Plus, with the Hoover I got used to the ""dirt finder"" light which turns on when it finds dirty."
4,Good so far...,"We've had this vacuum slightly less than a year and have been satisfied.Pros: Lots of options, easy to use, and good suction.Cons: Relatively short hose.I agree that the push lever that lowers and raises the handle is a bit difficult to push down with your foot, but I don't think it's as problematic as indicated in some of these reviews. And yes, it's fairly big. But, I don't think it's hard to push. Overall, four stars."
3,"Decent for the Price, When it Works","We bought this vacuum to replace our seven year old Kenmore. The Kenmore was the floor sample. The Kenmore still works, but we felt it was time to upgrade. I read these reviews and felt it, based on them, that the Boss was the best value for the price.Cons: It is heavier than the Kenmore, the hose detaches with the slightest brush against something (it is short as well), and to top it off, the belt broke before we'd even filled the first bag (we never had to replace the belt on the Kenmore). The Boss belt is this cheesy plastic thing you'd expect to see around a bundle of newspapers. I ordered a bunch of them because they are pretty fragile looking.Pros: When it works, it vacuums well. It looks nice. I assume the HEPA filter makes us safer, but it has been broken more than working, so once the new belts come, we'll see."
4,Fishnet thigh highs,"Fits well and looks good. The vendor shipped quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I thought I was ordering black with red satin bows though (this was probably my error) and I received the white with red bows. I received several compliments so I will definitely wear them again."
4,its a good product for how cheap it is,"It came fast in the mail and its really sexy. My husband loved it he thought it was sexy too, I only gave it four stars because it felt like its a little fragile and its a little tight on the top other than that I love it and its a good product for how cheap it is."
4,Baby cie to the rescue,"I bought this tray for my grandaughter. What I liked about it and what cought my eye is that it had four compartments. Most of the other trays I've seen had only three. The extra place for food certainly comes in handy. Since I babysit for her two days a week, I myself am finding the Baby Cie feeding dish very handy and helpful. I can dish out all the different foods she is learning to eat and not have a mess of different bowls in front of me. It is extremely easy to clean up as well and seems to take a beating with no dents and no scratches. It also comes in a nice variety of patterns and colors to match almost any decor. Its a good plate and feeding dish for the money."
3,Great Kungfu Gang film.,This film tells the story of two young men involved in the hardcore gang life of China. Filled with blood filled brawls and hand to hand and knife fights this film is entertaining and deep at the same time. One of the movies that lifted the careers of Ti Lung and David Chaing. Worth seeing if your a Shaw Brothers fan.
5,Husband loved this!,I bought this to hold all my husbands diver's certificates etc. He loves it and uses it continously
4,I'll take it!,I am happy with this product. It was sold as a business card holder but I am using it for credit cards. All good!
3,Good,"The product is good...genuine leather. Mis-description of color...said burgundy, it was brown.Really fast delivery. Thanks!"
2,misleading description,"Misleading Description! The leather is in good shape, But It is Not 10 inches long! . . . it is only 7"" by 4 1/2"""
4,Nice & Compact,This item is a great buy for the price. Real leather and it is nice and compact. The vendor shipped it right away!
5,Geat organizer,This is a great organizer. I keep several cards in my wallet and it would take a few minutes trying to locate. The organizer makes them easier to locate with a flip of a few pages. I also keep my receipts in the handy pouch inside front.
2,Not for 120 cards,"At first I though it can hold 120 cards as they said on the website, when I received it today, I found that it can only hold 60 cards. Why do they say it can hold 120 credit cards/business cards? Really misleading me. I was looking for the one which can hold 120 card but not 60 cards. I am very dispointed about that. Rest is fine."
1,"nice item, false advertising","Should have been (50 count), was sent one. Seller did give full refund, but it's annoying to get so many falsee advertisings on Amazon."
5,Brilliant!,"One of my favorite bands out of the '80s and they can still hold their own today. Brilliant CD, equally brilliant band. You won't be disappointed. If you like funk, you'll love APB. Give em a try!"
1,complete piece of junk,"Now I just want a simple toaster oven, nothing fancy but this thing can't even do toast much less anything else. It heats completely unevenly and you can not trust the timer at all.I don't expect it much for $25, but is it that difficult to at least make it to cook evenly and predictably?"
2,Too Complex,"The brand ""Toastmaster"" appealed to me based on other purchases I've made, and the model seemed to do everything I wanted at a reasonable price. However, the settings are too complicated. Unlike other toaster-oven-broilers I've had, this one requires you to change shelves, turn the inset over for different purposes, guess at time for toasting (rather than using light, medium, dark)."
1,Defective heating,"After reading the earlier reviews of this toaster oven, and having had a particularly poor experience with a Black & Decker toaster oven (1 month, then broken), my wife and I took a late night trip to Sears to pick up the oven.Brought it home, plugged it in, adjusted the knob to ""Toast"" and noticed that it would allow knob rotation PAST this setting - all the way back around.Set it to ""Toast"", set the timer, and the power light came on, along with a gentle humming indicating some sort of electrical activity.Waited for the glowing heating elements to appear.Continued waiting.Waited some more.Stuck my hand in the oven.Faint warmth.Set the oven to ""Broil.""Set the timer to 30 minutes.After about 2 minutes, the oven temperature was warmer.No glowing top elements, although they seemed to be producing the only heat in the oven.Cursed Toastmaster.We are returning the oven today.Can't recommend this unit."
2,Does everything but toast well,"The oven is inexpensive, attractive, has a large interior and is easy to clean. Unfortunately, it's not very good at toasting. It is very slow, and lacks clear settings for dark to light toast. I plan to replace it after having had it for only a few months."
2,Not a TOASTER oven,The dial for toasting means I can't set a level I like - each batch comes out differently. I had to fool around with the doohickey that makes the shelf come out when you open the door. It now works most of the time. It works pretty well as an oven for small things. But it is not a good toaster!
4,Great for the price!,"Let's face it. All toaster ovens are cheap, but this one works well and for the price is a great deal. I needed a small one and this is all that was available. The only problem is the hook that pulls out the rack when you open the door. I ended up removing it and now it works great!"
3,"Value for money, but...","If you are particular about the quality of your toasts, this may not be the right toaster for you. The looks and maintenance of this is decent, but slices of bread are not evenly toasted on both sides. The bottom side tends to get darker than the top side."
