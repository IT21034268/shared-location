4,It helps,"I hear complaints from others that things are hard to find in this dictionary, which is true. The Blackfoot language does not follow the format of English, which makes it hard to organize the language into a useful English book. On the other hand,it is great fun to browse around in the book and see what you can find. It is a treasure trove of cultural details. It is useful to look at the part of speech for each word and see how it fits in with the rest of the language, and also to read the usage examples.If you want to find a specific word and are stuck on that word, you will find this a very frustrating book. You must approach your search creatively and flexibly. Sometimes you will find what you are looking for, and sometimes you won't. You will have more luck with English to Blackfoot than you will with Blackfoot to English."
3,"""The gift that keeps on giving.""",Delighted to be able to find a gift for a Chuck Norris fan. And at an affordable price. Gift given to a retired martial arts and action movie fan. Maybe will give him some motivation to keep his activities going.
5,the best of the best!,"This Chuck Norris Collection is the best of his work,, 5 films in all.I'm a vet and watching these films is like a great justice to the Vietnam war and to all POW & MIA'S and how we American's would like to treat the drug dealers "" The American Way ""It's worth every penny and more."

2,Not for Induction Cooking,"When I purchased this pot, I typed ""induction cookware"" into the search box. This Fagor, as well as several other much more expensive products, came up. The description said it was suitable for all types of cooktops. None of the reviews said it did not work on an induction cooktop, and I knew Fagor markets residential induction burners, so I thought I was safe. WRONG! When it arrived I removed it from its very beat-up looking box and immediately tested it with a magnet. The magnet didn't stick at all. Still hopeful, I put an inch of water into it, put it onto my induction burner and turned it on. I got the error message and the burner shut off. Obviously it does not contain the requisite iron content. I packed it up and sent it back. (Amazon gave me a full refund including free return shipping.) Then I went to (must I admit it?) Walmart and bought their stainless stockpot, which works just fine for induction cooking."
4,Good value,This pot is exactly what I wanted. The price was right and the build quality is good. If only I had a double boiler insert for it then it would be perfect!
3,Too hot to handle!,"As I expected by the photo of this product when considering purchase, the pot has a very poor handle design. It gets very hot when using on the stove. It also took a considerable amount of time for water to come to a boil."
4,Good product,I feel its a bit expensive. Otherwise its a good product. Its made out of good quality steel. The finish is good too.
4,It does work on induction,"I bought the pan base on the copy that incited it worked on induction. t then read some reviews that said it did not so I was concerned I would have to send it back. Fortunately, the pan I received is induction-friendly. A magnet sticks, water boils, all is good. Love the two baskets - you can boil pasta and steam veggies and meat. Don’t’ be afraid of ordering it if you have induction cooktops."
3,It is cheap a one!,"It is ok, but seems to be cheap. It is too thin. I expected something more solid and stronger. Also I received it with a small damage: bend."
4,"Fun, Mindless Fun!","How I love Jackie Collins!! These days, there are so many boring, insipid books lurking under the guise of being ""deep"" or ""insightful"" - when really they're just high-minded nonsense. Jackie Collins is the antidote.Like all JC books, Sinners isn't about the plot, or the dialogue, or the writing. Sinners is about having fun. Jackie has created a bunch of interesting characters, and then thrown them into a story full of sex, drugs and movie stars!! A completely fun book - not deep, not insightful, not anything remotely high-minded. Sinners is just about enjoying a book - it's like gossiping over coffee."
1,Boring,"This was definitely the most boring Jackie Collins book I have read so far. I couldn't wait to finish reading it, I was hoping for something exciting to happen, like in her Lucky Series. But the book was long and terrible."
5,A true contribution to the architectural profession,"Ava Abramovitz has distilled her years of experience as attorney, advisor and mediator into a wonderfully readable book. Her insights and suggestions will benefit every architect who has strugged with uncertainty during contract negotiations. A wonderful addition to our professional library."
3,OK mess kit,"This is a great set-up if weight is not an issue. I bought this and used it for a couple of canoeing trips and its held up well. The teflon is scratched in a few spots but I don't baby my gear. However, it is a lot heavier and bulkier than I would want to haul around on backpacking trips. If you are a car camper or weight/size is not an issue, then buy this kit. It is decently priced and will last for years if you only go out a few times a year."
4,Nice Quality - a bit too large,"I have not used this set yet, but have noted that it is well made! Unfortunately, it is bulkier than I was expecting, and have only limited use for it. If you take long treks while keeping bulk and weight to a minimum is important, look for a smaller kit.This would work well for drive-up camping & tailgate parties."
5,Great little mess kit,"I used this camping last weekend, for both cooking and eating. It is a high-quality set (I'm not really including the plastic bowl and plastic cup), and cleaned up nicely too.It should also be mentioned that there's a little elastic strap that's included that wraps around the two metal pots and binds them together."
2,About what you'd expect for the price.,"Might impress a tenderfoot, but not a serious backpacker. It's bulky - not a problem if you're car camping - and only marginally self-storing. If you store the metal handle inside without wrapping it in something, it will scratch the Teflon. The cup and bowl are tippy - not suitable for primitive dining (stones and logs for furniture). And the pot is too shallow."
5,Wow!! That is about summing it up!,"Caroline Myss is an incredible revolutionary Mystic, with intellegence, practicality and a sense of humor. I bought this CD because I was suffering from Depression. It really is a Mind blowing CD. She really taps into a deeper, more meaninful part of ourselves. She answers some very interesting questions with incredible wisdom and insight. Why do some people heal, and not others? Is healing possible? Are some people ""Hooked"" on staying stuck in their disease? Why do some live and some die from their ailments? Why do people get sick in the first place?No, Caroline Myss is not the authority on Disease, but her brilliance, insight and wisdom really helps you to see how you have an active part in your life circumstances and illnesses. It helps to give you a sense of power back. Two other pluses are that she is funny, and the Prince of Whales speaks at the end of this CD. I would recommend it to anyone feeling ill, or stuck in their lives."
4,Taste great!,"I like the taste of this flavor, but after I already ordered them I found a sale for half the price (I paid shipping too!) at our drug store. Next time I will buy locally. But it is a great product."
1,Cheaply made,"I have a Fagor pressure cooker that I love and figured their canning set would be good quality. But it is not. There was no padding of any kind inside the box that contained all the kit items and the ladle was broken when I opened the bag. The jar lifter was held together with flimsy bolts and one was falling out. I never even looked at the rest of the items I just printed a return slip and put it all back in the box. Think I'll go to my local shop and buy a jar lifter, which honestly is the only one I can't live without."
4,Necessary,"These use to be every where and inexpensive to replace. Not any more! However this set is better than the one I used for over 40 years, maybe it will last for the next generation!"
5,Just what I needed!,"The products included everything I needed to start canning (other than the jars or pots"". It included a stainless steel funnel I found amazingly useful for other kitchen tasks as well. It is a good product for people just starting out canning."
2,Not for large batches,"Although the accessories in the this kit are very useful, the water bath basket is very small and not suitable for large canning projects."
2,Canning Rack Rusted,"The Fagor ""made in China"" canning rack rusted the second time I used it and left a rust stain in the bottom of my Fagor Canner. While, I did get the stain out, it looks like the rack is of very poor quality and I do not recommend it."
3,just OK,Used once or twice. Tools are either fairly thin wire or plastic. If planning on canning frequently or large volumes get something more substantial.
4,Glad I got it,"This isn't the greatest thing out there from what I can tell. I don't care because I had nothing! This is much better than nothing! The canning basket is a bit small & the handles are short. The recipe book is only for pressure canning & the instructions aren't so hot. I love the stainless canning funnel since most are plastic - yuck! I use everything in this kit except for the book! The lid lifter magnet is weak but if you are slow & patient, it does the job! I will keep my eyeballs open for a better basket at a yard sale or something like that, but in the meantime, I have what I need to can without problems."
3,If it weren't for the shipping I would love it.,I love the item but it took a month to get it. The tomatoes were done before it came in the mail. It started in Michigan went to Maryland and back to Michigan before I got it.
3,Buyer Beware -- NOT for pressure canning!,"Being new at canning I purchased this home canning kit, as I have the pressure cooker at home already. I quickly learned that pressure cookers are NOT considered safe for the high pressure canning method. So purchase this canning kit only for canning small batches of food using the hot water bath method of canning."
5,classic vincent price,The Pit and the Pendulum brought back my early days of being creeped-out without all the excessive blood and guts. Vincents' eyebrows should have been submitted to the Smithsonian. REVO
3,Being a two-fer is a benefit...,"First of all, these two movies should be viewed as ""psychological"" horror: don't expect ""monsters"" (other than human ones) or magic; after all, they are based on Edgar Allen Poe stories (though embellished). I prefer ""Pit and the Pendulum"" over ""House of Usher"", but each has its own take on the human mind.Vincent Price is simply superb. Whatever else one says about these movies, his acting can hardly be faulted.The DVD is that cost-effective but unsettling ""one movie per side"" design (watch where you put your fingers!), but the display quality is good. I would hesitate to buy ""House"" by itself, but adding it to ""Pit"" and pricing the pair low (even compared to single-movie DVDs) is a winning combination. Just don't expect to be scared witless."
4,Needs a new anamorphic transfer,"Great Corman classic and highly recommended.While the 2.35 letterbox flat print is adequate, this (and others in the Midnite Movies) needs a new transferfor widescreen anamorphic. When the image is blown up on the big screen, it's decidedly sizzly.Plays well enough on older CRT and small screen flat screens, but movies of this classic quality really need to bepreserved in the best possible way."
3,The Great Ending Saves It,"Boy, If I hadn't read another review beforehand which suggested hanging around for the end of this film, even if one gets bored early on, I might have given up on it. I'm glad I stayed with it. It's true; the last part is terrific.Once again, Vincent Price, as billed, has the lead and deserves the recognition as he emotes as only he could. The surprise is that Price plays such a wimp in this movie, which is out of character for him in his horror films but then - bang! - his REAL personality comes out. Ole Vinny fooled us all. It's shocking and it's pure Price. You'll love it!"
4,Classic Vincent Price,"I've loved these movies since I was a kid. No one can give you the creeps like Vincent Price, and no one can pull off a low budget horror film like Roger Corman. This is a great addition to any Halloween party. Make some popcorn, turn out the lights and enjoy."
2,Nowhere near as good as the video version,"If you're thinking of buying this widescreen DVD to replace your pan and scan video version, take my advice. Don't bother. The sound is very low and of poor quality; the image, though clear, is very dim and the colors are pale. While in the video version, the colors are rich; the image is bright and the sound level is high and of excellent quality.In fact, the only reason for buying this DVD is to see the original trailer and the movie in their original CinemaScope format. The disc has commentary by the director, Roger Corman, the sound level of which is twice the level of that on the film and without distortion. However, film afficianados shouldn't take his reminiscences too literally. For instance, he says what a marvellous score Ronald Stein wrote for this movie, when he of all people should know that it was Les Baxter who wrote the score for The Pit and The Pendulum, not Ronald Stein."
2,so-so,"I really liked the version of The Fall of the House of Usher with Martin Landau, but apparently it was not available. This film did not have many visual effects. and the plot was merely centered around the brother's over protection. I would like to have seen some changes in the house itself."
1,Not the full film,"The dvd is missing one of the best scenes from the video version of the same movie: The scene where the woman is being walled up alive by Vincent Price. I really wish the people who make dvd's would put the REAL and COMPLETE VERSION of the film on the dvd and stop cutting out various scenes, whatever their reasons may be.Still, this classic old film has some good acting and a good story line. It scared me to death when I was a kid, and it still has a touch of the creepy crawlies now that I'm a much older adult."
2,Roger Coreman film - bad acting,"Sorry - I don't think these are worth even the low price. If I'd noticed it was a Roger Corman film I would never have ordered - low budget, bad acting, poor color. I love Vincent Price but couldn't get past the first 20 minutes."
3,Vincent Price fan,"Vincent Price did a good job with the movie, but the script needed moredetails into the character's past."
4,Spend some time in the dungeon,"Somewhat flat acting by everyone except Mr. Price (who is quite entertaining, if a bit over the top) is redeemed by terrific sets and subtle, effective direction by Mr. Corman. The widescreen transfer of the very good source print is crisp and bright, with wonderful colors. Mr. Matheson's story goes off in its own direction from the Poe original, but it nevertheless preserves many of the troubled author's beloved themes, and is involving and entertaining in a ""literate comic book"" type of way. A wonderful commentary track by Mr. Corman (who always has lots of great stories and inside info in his DVD commentaries) and a nice selection of genre trailers make this inexpensive DVD a great bargain. You get a lot for your money here."
2,Sound quality is not very good,"Video quality is fine. A bit dark, colorization is good, but the sound quality is quite bad. I bought this for my classroom, and I had to turn the volume to the loudest setting to hear the dialogue, then stay near the TV so when the screams occur it doesn't blast the windows out."
4,Must See movie for its subject matter and genre,"For its time period, this is a classic picture which seems to combine elements from ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" with ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" I used this in the classroom in high school and the students were engaged with it in spite of the fact that the picture is over 50 years old. It holds up in that classic 50s style horror film."
1,HOT TRASH!!,"I COULDA SPENT MY 7 DOLLARS ON A REAL MOVIE LIKE BOURNE IDENTITY OR GRANDMA'S BOY!I WANT MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS WACK RENDITION OF THE POE CLASSICS.YO EDGAR, YOU MUST BE SPINNIN IN YOUR GRAVE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!"
4,Good Corman,This is a movie I remember from the early 60's in a theater packed with kids screaming during the scary parts. It's atmospheric and the commentary from Corman really adds to the enjoyment as you get an insider's perspective on the making of horror movies on a budget. Vincent Price is in great form!
5,Vincent Price At His Best!!,This is my all time favorite VP classic horror movie. It leaveseverything else out in the cold. The action never stops and the scare is there! Not knowing is the best scare going! Watch this one over and over..Nicholas...Nicholas!
4,The Pit and the Pendulum,For all Vincent Price fans or horror fans. No one does Poe like Price. Good cast and plot. Also would recommend Fall of the House of Usher. Also starring Price in a Poe tale. Good scary movie/old time style. Enjoy Lisa C.
4,Priceless Vincent Price,"Vincent Price portrays Nicholas Medina, a man tormented and haunted not only by his beloved wife's recent death but also because his father Sebastian operated a torture chamber and murdered Nicholas' mother. His brother-in-law Francis Barnard (John Kerr) comes to the forboding Medina castle to investigate his sister Elizabeth's death only to experience mysterious ""happenings"", which seem to suggest that Elizabeth might be alive after all. Vincent Price hams it up wonderfully, and the incredibly spooky atmosphere makes things pretty creepy as well. Hang in there during the first slow half, the second half makes it all worthwhile and Mr. Price swings a mean pendulum."
5,Very Good; Pretty Spooky,"This one is good, but it's scary when they open the coffin, to see if she's alive when they buried her. She was, sort of. She had her hands around her neck and her mouth like she was screaming. I'm only eleven, too. But I like Classics, and this is one of my favorites. Just don't watch it on a creepy, stormy night, when you're all by yourself..."
2,The Fall Of The House of Usher/Pitt and the Pendulum,I loved it Saturday night on TV as a child but now it seems dull. The only bright spot is Price's acting. Read Poe's story instead.
5,What a ride!,"This book is a wonderful excursion into the sometimes wacky history of New York City! I lived here all my life and their were many things I did not know about which I learned while reading this fantastic book. It's a roller coaster ride of the most unususl, yet true stories that must be told! It.s a great book for anyone, but if you live in NY, You NEED this book..."
5,Perfect for everything!,"This pan does so many things that you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Great for grilling meats. Use as a wok. Good for casseroles, chili or soup. Easy to clean. Love the see-through lid. I use it several times a week."
2,"Good grill, terrible slow cooker","This is a nice counter top grill; it cooks well and is easy to clean. The round shape will make it more difficult to store.Don't try to use it as a slow cooker. The heating element appears to be either on high heat, with the liquid boiling way up the sides, or off, with the liquid not even at a simmer. With the temperature set at 325, the liquid boiled off completely in about 35 minutes. The lid does not fit securely, so the steam escapes and makes a mess of any cabinets over it."
4,Aroma grill,Aroma Housewares grills are great and last a long time. My previous Aroma grill lasted 25 years. However this was not the grill that I was looking for this time. I need a smaller grill for a smaller family now.
4,GOOD~,"This is very good!!It is very good~Very good!~~~~~I think it is good~it is safe and easy to use~so if u wanna buy it,u choose the right thing~"
3,Not what i thought it would be,I like the pot but it's not eactly what i thought it would be.The unit itself is bigger than i though it would be; the insert is heavy which makes it hard to clean w/o getting the probe area wet; it is the perfect size for one or two; but it's too big to use as a grill for one person. so i haven't used it much. will probably use more in the winter to make stews/soups. Wish it had more recipes.
1,Aroma Super Pot with grills,The Aroma Super Pot had obviously been rejected and recycled. The thermostat was inoperable and had a small crack in the plastic. I bought it as New not a Used item. I cooked with one of these pots at a friend's house and loved it but was afraid to return it for a replacement because I had previously received a Kitchen Aid mixer from Amazon ordered New and received damaged.
5,Awesome Pot,I like this item very much. It's so power that the water in it hot so quickly! Tomorrow I'll use it as a hot pot and invite my friends to dinner. Awesome!
4,question about temp.control,I like the nonstick pan its great and being able to adjust the temp. The reason I knocked it one star was because I noticed if I set it at one temp but needed to reduce the heat it would just shut off. Don't know if this is normal??
5,Just What I wanted!,"I've always been fascinated by Da Vinci, but never had the time to read a long dense biography or really study him properly. Then I got a copy of Da Vinci for Dummies. It is just what the doctor ordered. It gave me the historical overview that I really wanted and enough specifics about his activities to make me want more. The book is well written, easy to read and truly capitaviting. He was such an interesting character and this book really opens the door. Bravo!"
2,Cycling in Baltimore: A Family Guide,"From the standpoint of a cyclist who doesn't live near Baltimore, this book is no help at all. It offers a description of 16 bike rides, most of them near Baltimore or Anne Arundel county, and a few rides in Pennsylvania and Virginia. This may be helpful for anyone near the city, but I feel calling it a guide for Maryland is misleading.....However, their descriptions do go into great detail about directions, what kind of traffic you can expect, and the wildlife you may encounter. There are about 10 pages for each trail described.If you're looking for good biking near the city then I highly recommend this book....."
2,boring,I have read books by this author Barabara Leaming before one of Marilyn Monroe which I really liked I guess I thought and was expecting more and it was not that good.
1,The Guide that Fails to Guide,"I honestly feel cheated having bought this little book. The title is misleading, for it is not so much a guide as a poorly written memoir. I was looking for information and found nothing useful here. If you're looking for a thoughtful and eloquently written memoir see Jan Morris's classic ""Conundrum."" If you're looking for a source of information for potential transsexuals - well, I haven't found one yet. You'd do well to just skip this one."
3,Not the best book but full of heart,I must admit I was disappointed when I read this book. I am transsexual and in my early fifties. I am just coming out and finally doing something about me. When I bought the book I was looking and was expecting more from it. That being said there are two reasons I will keep this book 1) The author wrote it with her full heart in to it and 2) She transitioned later in life which encourages me. It is too bad that she didn't have more help editing the book or change the title to reflect that it was more about her journey than advice on on how avoid the heart breaks of the journey. I was hoping that the book would have been hopeful and helpful. It was not so much.
5,"Does the job, and does it well","Very pleased with this scraper. We have an incredibly muddy little backyard that has recently acquired 3 chickens, ""enhancing"" the mud to such a degree that I'd rather not track it into the house. Researched a bunch of scrapers--none of the cutesy hedgehog-types seemed capable of standing up to pretty heavy use so I went with something more utilitarian and I'm glad I did. Screwed the the scraper to a wide wood board (didn't bother with anchors; didn't seem necessary), plopped it outside the back door, and put it to the test. Bingo! A few passes through with each foot and it got nearly all the schmutz out from the cleats in my boots! So glad to have this in time for spring, when the rains turn our yard into La Brea."
2,Not very well made,"This item showed cracked wood on the sides within a few weeks. Also the metal has rusted even though I live in a desert and it has only rained 2.2 inches this year (and its August now). While it does the job moderately well, it is not well made and therefore not a good buy."
4,Very nice new Christmas album,Very nice mostly instrumental Christmas album. The one song with his daughter is very cute and she's not a bad singer for a child.
5,Like George Winston before him...,"I have been a huge fan of George Winston's ""!December, Piano Solos: 20th Anniversary Edition"" for what feels like forever. Jon Schmidt is definitely a piano player of the same high caliber. I'm listening to this disc as I'm writing this review. A beautifully relaxing cd that like ""December"" reminds me of the feeling of watching fresh falling snow. A perfect soundtrack for a winter's day"
3,Not OEM,"The hose was a less than OEM. The large end was not nearly as long as original. Had trouble installing and still have doubts about it holding. Did not go fully onto pipe. Was short by 3/4"" at least going on water pump outlet."
3,"KING OF SOUL, LADY SOUL, AND WICKETT PICKETT...CHECK IT OUT","One of the better James Brown performance videos even if his performance is constantly interrupted by mega/super/whatever-stars doing HIS greatest hits - only Wilson delivers (""Cold Sweat"" - a version later been *copied* to a certain degree by JB? ). The best moment is ""Please, PLease, PLease"" in duet with Aretha. Brown himself is really up for the occasion, trimmed down and in motion. However, we have another concert video which does not involve the happy patrons - a typical by-the-book edit."
5,A must have!,"You will not be disapointed w/ this video! I was at this show as a guest w/ Mr. Joe Cocker and I am the one Robert Palmer is dancing w/ in the white jumpsuit,long,""PERMED"" hair :) The music is awesome! A must have to any music collection! Enjoy!"
4,You must picture an Englishman turn cowboy in this one,"This was my first time to read Lorraine Heath. This story was pretty good. At times, it was easy for me to put this one down and come back later. I plan on reading ""Always to Remember"" by Heath next. I've been told it's her best. Happy reading."
2,"Anything secret? No, nor new either...","There is ABSOLUTELY nothing new and/or secret in this volume. Just a rehash of ideas and lists and schedules that have been presented thousands of times before and in much better and more enjoyable style. Not a complete waste but close to it.By the way, I work as a freelance housekeeper so I do have some experience on the subject."
5,great cookie sheet,"For what it's worth, this is the first review I have made. It is in response to one of the reviews online where the women was very negative and thought the cookie sheet the worst ever. I completly disagree, and so do others, as it is out of stock and you can't get one without a long wait. I love the ways things don't stick, how evenly the cookies are browned, and how the sheet provides such a uniform heating surface. It cleans up niceoy too. I gave my son and his wife one and they love it.I would buy two more if I could and throw my others away. It is a little priceybut quality always wins out."
5,Console savestates are pretty awesome.,"The game saver does exactly what it says: press select + R at any point to save your current game state and select + L to return to it at any point. It even keeps the music going, so you can listen to a full track while practicing a difficult part of the game! (That has more to do with the SNES hardware, though). It also has the bonus of letting you play Super Famicom games on your Super Nintendo. Very useful if you have the smaller version of the console that is a pain to mod. What's not to love?You'll need to enter codes for certain games to get them to work properly. Here's the best picture of the code list I could find: http://i.imgur.com/wPbvhsn.jpg"
2,Ehhh.,"I would say that this is a nice product, if I received the product I thought I ordered.I was inclined to believe that this was the Super Nintendo SNES Game Saver + , as stated in thename and product information. The item I got was just the SNES game saver, not the one mentioned, which has a different look and a cable that plugs into thesnes.Its an okay product, but I was it was more clear that they give the SNES Game Saver and NOT the GAMES SAVER PLUS."
5,"Review of ""The Sun in Time"" University of Arizona Press","This is a superb text whose editors have done yeoman duty coalescing the work of the best scientists in the field. The articles within this tome are remarkably accessible to the layperson, such as myself, keenly interested in astronomy, its history, and its current research. The authors of the articles in this encyclopedic work have exercised commendable care in documenting their sources, back to and including Galileo's pioneering work to discover that, contrary to the doctrine of the time, the Sun's disc isn't free of ""blemishes."" This is the first work (of many) I've studied which made crystal-clear how the variation in sunspot paths across the disc during the year served to support some conjectures and refute others concerning the Sun."
2,"It works, but....","I bought this Jet clamping kit deeply discounted. At regular price, I would not touch it. It seems to be no different than the same products you can find around here for a lot less money (Grizzly clamping kit, for example). The tray is plastic, NOT metal as indicated in the description. I give it two stars for being of decent quality. At the 70%+ off price I bought it at, it was a good deal. But at full price? Look elsewhere."
2,Nice try,"As an occasional reader of medieval alchemy (first encountered in the works of Manly P Hall) and a student of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, this book immediately fascinated me.The book, however, disappoints.There are the obvious analyses of the Wake's obligatory alchemical references - handled judiciously if not with inspiration. But that is all and that is the disappointment. Though the book tries, it reads like an uninspired graduate thesis. The basics are touched but there's too much left unaddressed. The author's conventional treatment of alchemy reminds me of Jowett's handling of Plato's Timaeus - uninspired. Specific issues: A thorough recital of the tenets and symbols of alchemy, and a rigorous tabular account of their correspondences with Wakean themes is lacking. Also, a tying-in of the luminaries of alchemy and their cameo appearances throughout the Wake might have been attempted.Two stars for being the only currently available discussion of alchemical motifs in Finnegans Wake."
3,Potential But...,"I picked up this book as I had a similar idea once and I thought it would be interesting. The art in the book is great but the story and dialogue didn't really measure up to anything for me. Half the time it seems as if Chadwick is either trying to give you a moral lesson or trying to show off how much he knows about a certain thing or culture such as when Concrete went to help out on a farm. The book is written in a series of books that are practically separate from one another, besides the origin stories you could just mix and match and it wouldn't matter. The book does come to a conclusion but it doesn't feel like one that has meaning throughout the whole book."
3,Nice but too small,"This diablo should be good for a child, or to be carried around a small back pack to kill time.I got it fo rmy 8 year old daughter and it was right for her, untill she decided she wanted a Circus which she could barely handle because of the weigh(she wanted te same as her daddy's) Because of the weigh it is really dificult to get it spinning fast enough for a lot of tricks. If you want a diabolo for an adult get the Circus, its one of the best all around diabolos out there. Dont get me wrong its top quality materials, just too small for a lo tof tricks"
4,Very detailed map,"This is a great map that is easy to read, easy to carry and fold/unfold, and has tiny little towns on it. It is a helpful too for driving and travel."
3,Third PHP book.,"When I got this book, I was quite familiar with the language, so syntax and learning php wasn't really what my purpose was.It has been emphasized repeatedly in online reviews, as well as within this book that it is not for the novice programmerThis book aims to help you better understand project management and how to design your web based applications.Let me give a really small example. I wrote a web based mail program for some clients, and 3 programmers and myself spent about 4 weeks on the project. It was well done, no problems, and our clients were happy.After reading this book, I can think of 20 different ways of making that program better.Again, this isn't meant for the novice programmer, but experienced programmers / project managers looking to expand their php horizons should pick up a copy."
5,A Fantastic Reference,"No, this book is not for beginners. Maybe it's not for absolute gurus, either. But for those of us in the middle-to-advanced stage, it's a godsend.This is the first PHP book I found that explained the entire process and didn't just regurgitate the PHP function reference with a few extra snippets of code.The authors, by the way, have written some great PHP tools. If I hadn't seen PHPMyAdmin, I probably would not be using PHP or MySQL. They have had a huge impact on the PHP community and are extremely skilled at writing both code and books like this.Evaluate your needs. If you don't know anything about programming or PHP, start with Julie Meloni's book or the Wrox books. If you've been programming for 20 years, know how to create a complex application, know all about CVS and PHPLib, go get a function reference and dig in. If you have some PHP under your belt and are looking for a reference to help you understand application development, GET THIS BOOK."
2,For Novice Programmers Only,"This book wastes alot of time teaching you how to program and organize a project. That's all good and fine, but belongs in a different book. If your a novice programmer you will like it.If you're an experienced programmer, find another book on PHP.The end of the book is full of the Zend API. Anyone who is advanced enought to get into the Zend API doesn't need this book."
2,Misleading title and content,This book is a big disappointment. They give all kinds of content on unrelated and unnecessary subjects with virtually no fundamentals or syntax explanations. This was a waste of time and money.
2,"Pedantic, better books out there","I'm quite unhappy with this book. The book is entitled ""Web Application Development with PHP 4.0. The first few chapters however, seem to be more of a lecture as to how to name variables and how to work with a team developing code. This should have been an appendix. This book is misnamed and tedious.I much prefer MySQL book written by Paul DuBois, and PHP Essentials book by Julie C. Meloni. Both of those are more down to earth, accessible, and informative."
2,Dreadful examples and confusing text,"I have many years experience programming and have been doing PHP for awhile. This book has lots of philosophy and not many concrete examples of advanced PHP technique.The section on objects is especially poor. It reads as if the authors don't understand OOP and the examples are extremely poor. (I have over ten years OOP analysis, design, and programming in numerous OO languages, so, I should know)I found myself wasting a lot of time playing with sample code that didn't work, was poorly written, and certainly didn't illustrate what was being discussed.The book is so poor, I wonder if those who wrote the good reviews actually read and used the book or just looked through it."
2,Dreadful writing poorly organized,"I had such high hopes after I'd picked up David Beazley's excellent Python reference in the same series. Unfortunately, the writing is just awful and apparently unedited.There's no cohesion, no real goals apparent in the prose. The first chapter is a rambling discussion of why you should use good descriptive variable names.Later on, personal anecdotes about the history of the web world dot the pages, as if they added something.Editors! Editors! We need more editors! See also ""Professional PHP Programming"" for another book badly in need of an editor."
3,good for midwives,I bought this in preparation to become a midwife but after plans changed I didnt need the book anymore. It was a good book and a good read. If you are interested in pregnancy and childbirth.
5,Amazing help,This textbook is really excellent and helpful if you look for a holistic approach to birth ..... It is complete and very thourough ...
2,Wading through mud!,"This is the third Mario Balzic mystery I've read, and I just don't see what the fuss is about. Reading the dialog in one of K.C. Constantine's books is like wading through thick mud...constant effort until it becomes tiresome in the extreme. Family Values has a 7-page-long fight between Mario and his wife, Ruth...replete with wannas, wouldas and 'causes...well, let me put it in K.C.'s/Mario's lingo: Geez, I shoulda thrown the book out!"
3,you get what you pay for,"It's hard to buy hats without trying them on. My size is different depending on the company that makes the hat. so beware of that fact, it may not fit even though that is your size."
1,not as advertised,"big dumb looking hat. not your average hat, forehead area is huge. it looks like an old school trucker hat that you would see in a terrible horror movie."
1,Size chart sucks,I'd like to buy the hat but can't tell what size I should order but I did find out that I have a 2' head :D
3,To the dude from TX,"Hey, before you judge others, make sure that you are irreproachable. You misspelled ""scary!"""
3,Imaginative Science Fiction Romance,"I thought the book was a clever imaginative after-life story. The author apparently is a fan of Nelson Eddy and knew all the facts of his life and death that most of us know. I recognized immediately that she had used him as the character for her book. And she was very complimentary and kind with his character. I think the author has a good science fiction mind and wrote a very interesting, futuristic story. Way too long - but I really enjoyed the first couple of chapters."
2,"A loving tribute, but not without flaws","To Love Again is the author's obviously deeply-felt tributeto singing star Nelson Eddy. The premise of the story is agood one - two lovers transported into a future world that hassuffered from the selfish thoughtlessness of human beings and isslowly being rebuilt, while they themselves have a chance tolive their lives over again in the love that was denied themthe first time round.Unfortunately, it seems the publishers envisioned a limitedmarket, and thought it wasn't worth spending time and moneyproviding an editor. The book, while a lot of fun to read,is marred by numerous mistakes in grammar, spelling andpunctuation, not to mention construction, that a good editorwould have tidied up. Obviously, there was no proof readereither, else the many typos would also not have gone unnoticed.An interesting book that could have been much better."
3,Microplane Rotary Grater,"I was disappointed by the flimsy nature of this product when being used with hard cheeses. Why not make the body more reinforced in order to not flex when being used? The actual grater mechanism did an excellent job cutting the cheese, but when the body flexes in your hands as you are using it, so much effort is being wasted instead of being transferred into grating that cheese!"
3,Microplane Vs. Zyliss,"microplane's grating drum is superb, however, the housing is flimsy and the unhinging mechanism is difficult to open.zyliss has a more substantial housing,is easier to disassemble, but has an inferior drum blade compared to microplane. Both get the job done."
1,"Flimsy, not up to Microplane standards","I used this once. All the cheese stayed inside the drum, and I had to take the grater apart to remove the cheese. The plastic bent while it was being used on your basic supermarket cheddar, not a very hard cheese. After one use I threw it out."
2,Not well made...,This product worked great at first but as other reviewers have pointed out it is not very well made. After less then a year of use one of the flanges that hold the grip at the end of the rotating arm broke causing the grip to come out when using the grater.
3,Different title would help....,"This book was ok and had many good pointers on becoming an engaged activist. It was, it seemed a little too ""seen"" through the authors eyes with some ranting on the Kerry defeat and the current leaders. It also needed some editing, with the readers having to wait for Mr. Sachs to get off his soapbox and get to the point. But there are golden nuggets of truth in here, if your willing to chip away at the words and personal opinions.I'll be waiting for Noah Levine's ""Against The Stream"", might suit the younger crowd better."
1,Too political.,This book is more about political activism than it is about anything related to Buddhist principles.
1,Dennis,"The book had a number of interesting observations. The Goering quote was priceless. But I purchased the book to further enhance my understanding of the Buddhist path. As a liberal thinker, I try to connect the dots, or identify the disconnects, between Buddhist concepts/teachings and what is happening in the world today. The author seemed quite determined to use the book as an opportunity to bash Bush and US policy as frequently as possible, cleverly using sarcasm as well (e.g., his quoted reference to the ""coalition of the willing""). Not that Bush doesn't deserve it! I cringe when I hear the Christian right hijack their own religion to tout their moral superiority and bash the left. Similarly, I cringed a bit at times during the political bashing in this book. A student of Buddhism would be better served to read the works of the Dalai Lama, who makes his points point quite clearly and powerfully without having to wade into politics."
4,"Laidback, clear german music","I like this and much of Dirk's other music for two reasons. Firstly, it is pleasant; many of the tracks are genuinely catchy pop songs. No, it generally does not rock out or showcase masterful musicianship. Secondly, the lyrics are in German and fairly clearly spoken. As an amateur speaker of German, I enjoy having this resource where I can listen to a native speaker speaking rather clearly."
1,Much room for improvement,"I bought three of these for using around a camp site and was very disappointed in their design. They failed to work without rigging. The issue is with the connections to the batteries. There is no stable contact and power does not flow into the device. The instructions are essentially useless and once the citronella disc is in the device it is impossible to replace without breaking something. The fan does not adequately disperse the citronella, the area of effect is about 4x4'. Overall high inadequate and not worth the money. Better off getting torches."
1,"The evil itself,avoid at any cost!","This sounded as a great idea,but almost impossible to make it works! Needs major improvements,so keep away from this shield!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't Buy this Card,"I bought this card in 2003. It has given me a lot of grief:1) It hangs up continually on Autocad & Adobe Photoshop2) Not suitable for intense gaming (Flight Simulator 2002. Won't work well with FS2004).3) The 2nd output at the back is digital flat panel only. For all my games and Graphics, I need two monitors (CRT's, not flat panel).Pass this one by. Don't buy anything from Leadtek.Buy an ATI 9700 XT - the best value for money."
4,Great,This card is the best mainstream card. It is fast @250/500 but there isnt much room for overclocking. I have mine overclocked to 280/560 and it has a fan on it almost identical to that of the 9600PRO and it's core clock is @400MHz..and By the way it is in my reccomendation to buy heatsinks for around $15 to put on the momry if you overclock.
4,Other reviews may be misleading.,"Some people who wrote previous reviews don't seem to grasp the concept of the framerate of their games being determined by their overall system performance, not just the video card itself. Did you guys ever stop to think that your processor is bottlenecking the performance of your video card? How about the speed of and amount of RAM you have in your system? Did you ever think that correctly installing the drivers for your motherboard and video card could cure your blue screen woes? Sometimes computer problems start between the keyboard and the chair... if you take the time to research how video cards, motherboards, and computers in general work, perhaps you would not have so many problems. Not to mention that this IS only a PCI card... you can't expect a world of performance to come from a video card that's limited by the bandwidth of the PCI bus."
1,Piece of crap ! Minus 10 stars !,This is a piece of crap card. Bought a new one and in the middle of the games freezes my computer. VisionTek support says that it is not compatible with a Dual processor system although you can never find that in the description of the card or anywhere else for that matter. I moved the card in a single processor system where is on the IRQ they recommend and does the same although not that often. I've send it to Visiontek and they returned it to me without doing nothing with a note that the card is fine. Avoid this product and other Visiontek products at any cost or you will be sorry!
3,Keep Sending Wrong Product,"I have ordered this product twice. The first time I recieved the wrong product (tangerine flavored regular). I was assured that the problem had been identified and fixed and was sent the correct product. I was pleased with the prompt service. That was four months ago, I have since re-ordered and again recieved the wrong product. I reported it today and we will see. The customer service is very quick and efficient with this company but keep in mind if you order this product you might be using them yourself. If not for that I'd give it five stars."
3,"Good, but not as soluble as other flavors","I'm a big fan of Emergen-C, but it's my experience that the Tangerine flavor doesn't dissolve as effectively as the other flavors. I have no explanation why, but I've consistently gotten heavy clumping with this flavor. I assume the composition of the powder is different, but I get big clumps whether I put it in before or after the liquid.The Wally World near my house now only stocks this flavor, sadly."
4,Literally changed my life,Long story short... trying to read this book has made me realize that I do not want to pursue meteorology.
3,shurflo pump,The order went off quick and I am happy with that. The pump is not what I would call top of the line.Small leaks that want go away use and a few adjustments.The pump don't put out any more power than the 30 psi pump that was on the tank. So I could have bought a cheaper 30 psi pump and been as well off.So other than that it works and I am getting spaying done as needed so life goes on.
5,Spiritual Astrology: Your Personal Path to Self-Fulfillment,Another Spiller great! Amazingly accurate and a great guide.
2,YUCK!,"I saw this at a local CVS store a couple times right next to their own, knockoff, brand. The knockoff was about a quarter of the cost, so thought I'd try it AND LOVED IT.a couple months later, their price had gone up and Amazon had it at a decent rate, I figured I'd give it a go.UGH!Maybe it matters that I dilute the knockoff in 40 oz of water (2 20 oz bottles that I take to work)This stuff is only tolerable if mixed in less than 12 oz.I think I found someone to take it from me. I'm going back to the CVS brand."
1,deceiving,"If you enlarge the image of this product it says that it contains 1000 mg Cranberry powder. I received a cranberry flavored product, which upon my complaint was then replaced for free - with exactly the same cranberry flavored product again, so either the product does not exist like depicted or the people in the warehouse keep on pulling the wrong product of the shelf again and again. However, I was fully refunded for the cost of this product."
5,This stuff really works,"The minute I start feeling early symptoms of a cold, I start chugging this plus Echinecea supplements. Within a day or two, the symptoms are gone. If I'm already sick, I take this and the cold goes away faster. It tastes pretty good. You can make hot or cold drinks with it. I've only tried it cold and it's not grainy or gross at all. It's almost like a fruit flavored drink. I have friends who like to make it into a kind of tea and it works for them. So far, everyone I know who has tried this product has loved it."
4,Worth a try!,"The product came quickly and in perfect condition. I don't know if this really works or not but I take it at early signs of a cold or flu and I think it may make a difference. I am not sure. That said it is easy to take and I do take it along when I travel, especially on airplanes to avoid catching some unwanted illness. I guess it can't hurt. Try it it might do the trick for you."
2,Not impressed,"As a mom of to biracial kids, I was excited to see this book and share it with them. However after reading it for myself first, I regret purchasing it! I am not impressed with the dad in the story making himself dirty in order to look darker, and I dont think this puts race in a positive light. The illustrations are dark and not encouraging to a kid looking for acceptance. I will NOT be sharing this book with my children!"
3,Interesting story but a little weird,I'm not really excited about this book because the story gets a little weird and the illustrations aren't that appealing to me. A black child and her white step-father talk about swapping their ethnicities. It's was OK until dad starting rubbing coffee grounds on his face. Not something I'd probably read to my kids just because I can come up with a better way to teach them about the differences in ethnicities in people.
5,Excellent recipes,"This was a great book for my wife and I who have eaten out at restaurants easily 10% of the time now that we have a grill and this book. An excellent investment, that makes the weekends even more fun than I thought they could be. I recommend this!"
2,A Little Too Large and Jumbled,"I love the original ""Barbeque Bible"" and ""Sauces, Rubs and Marinades"" by Steve Raichlen so I thought this book would be great, but I'm disappointed. I've looked through the book twice so far and I'm overwhelmed by the layout of the stories/recipes. It's not that easy to follow. The graphics and the text are not placed on each page in an easy to read manner. It all looks crowded and jumbled and you can't tell where one recipe begins and another ends. I also have not found any good recipes yet that I think are worth making.I'll look through the book once more and if I don't find anything appealing then I'll sell my used copy here on Amazon."
2,BBQ cook book,"Not what I thought I was getting by the title of the book. I thought it was going to be a recipe book but I have to wade through info and recipes that I have no use for. I enjoy the video shows that Steven Raichlen has on PBS but again, more pointless info in this book than I would expect."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"The layout of the book could be a little nicer, but there are lots of recipes! Not exactly how I expected it to be."
5,Awesome!,Use this cookbook all of the time! We are big fans of Steven Raichlen! This book is excellent! Highly recommended
2,Not as expected.,"My husband and I watched a marathon on television of Steve Raichlen and thought this book would contain his recipes. Oh, no, not one. What a disappointment."
5,Best BBQ recipe book I own,"I bought this book a couple years ago and originally didn't make much out of it because I foolishly thought a lot of the recipes were too complicated. Later I realized that was a ridiculous notion and I started making all sorts of amazing meals from this book. I've already had it fall apart at the chicken section - I've made nearly every entry in that chapter multiple times, and they always end up being a huge hit.I later bought the Barbecue Bible, which is also good, but after starting with BBQ USA the Barbecue Bible is collecting dust by comparison. I've bought this as gifts several times now, insisting that everyone I know tries my favorite recipes from it."
4,Some interesting Recipes...,"There are some good recipes from all over the country in this book...This book is one of my ""must haves"" in my kitchen..."
5,Great Buy,"BBQ USA: 425 Fiery Recipes from All Across AmericaThe best barbecue book I have ever had - full of history, interesting anecdotes, and most of all outstanding recipes - from quick and simple to gourmet. The instructions are clear, and the results are great. I highly recommend this book for the beginner and well as the master barbecue chef. You and your guests will not be disappointed."
5,Must have,"This book is a must have for grillers. I watch the TV show a lot,and have learned so much. That is why I bought the book."
4,BBQ USA,Bought this because my neighbor has the first edition. He can BBQ for sure! Recopies' are delicious. I wish there was some of the information found in the first book so I will have to buy that one. Good purchase and would highly recommend to all.
5,A MUST for grillers and bbq'ers!!!!,"I was given this book about 8yrs ago from a bank rep along with a bbq accessory set. I have since ripped the cover off and hoarded all the recipes not telling a soul where I got them from! I have made at least 60 of the recipes and each one is better then the rest. The grilling techniques truly enhance each dish whether you are on gas or charcoal. If you are like me and enjoy the process of in depth recipes, look no further. Most recently I made the ""Perfect Thanksgiving Turkey with Maple Red Eye Gravy""...a grilled 12lb turkey!!.... PERFECTION. The reviews were stellar from my guests. It was the tastiest, juiciest turkey I have ever had. Fyi, this is one of the first reviews I have EVER given. This book is my bible and I use it as much as possible. The man is a genius!!!! BUY THE BOOK!!!"
5,Lots of good Recipes!,"I have watched Steven on PBS for years. This book has some really great stuff in it! The only negative is that his recipes call for many different items, 5 -9 minimum."
5,BBQ USA by Steven Raichlen,"This is my ""Go To"" BBQ bible when I am looking for a great recipe. I have used my copy for several years and have purchased several for friends just getting into the sport of BBQ. I have not missed yet with the wonderful recipes in BBQ USA. There are also some interesting BBQ stories from around the country. You will not be disapointed if you add this book to your collection!"
3,A Great Read for the Inexperienced PC Builder,"First off, Lloyd's book is very informative for someone interested in building a PC gaming rig. However, the rating for this book was intermediate-advanced and I feel that this book should have been rated for beginner-intermediate. The mete of the book talks about how a computer breaksdown code to give 3D sound and graphics. What I was looking for was a book that starts with the construction and optimization of the ultimate gaming PC. I was really looking for troubleshooting conflicts and tweaking the BIOS. I liked the book but can only give it three stars only for its misrating. (note: Lloyd Case's hardware reviews and articles at Gamespot are more informative for the intermediate-advanced crowd.) =-)"
2,VERY outdated,This has to be at least 3 or 4 years old. I dont see how you could advise people on building the ULTIMATE game pc today by using 4 year old technology.However it does give a rather nice description of how thing inside the computer work.
4,Good stuff,A little outdated but covers the basics of what you'll need to build your own dream machine.
3,the Avengers,"This is a pretty good album. I like it anyways. If you like the devotchkas you will like this because this is like an older more british style of the devotchkas. If you like the devotchkas, the casualties,the unseen, crass,the distillers(some of the old stuff),the havoc and wanna lisen to some good punk routs yo should buy this album.-Surfergurl125@aol.com"
4,Another special relationship,The Deal portrays the rise of the two men who remade the Labour Party in early 90s and kicks off the Peter Morgan/Stephen Frears cycle of films about Blair in the 90s. David Morrissey and Michael Sheen are as close as you can get to the real Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Morrissey's Brown is every bit the autistic powerhouse and Sheen's Blair is every bit as amiable and slippery as the men in real life.
4,"A solid translation of the I Ching classic - small, portable","I've had two copies of this version of the I Ching -- a mass paperback and a larger, quality paperback -- and have given them away to friends needing a great, introductory text and usable guide. This was always one of my favorites -- easy to use, easy to understand, with text and interpretation true to classical meanings of the I Ching hexagrams. I recommend this as a first book for beginners."
3,Just the essentials,"I recently purchased this to fill in my collection of versions of the I Ching. The Blofeld translation seems to be highly regarded by other translators.This is a nice, compact book - just the essentials. (So many translations are big tomes.) I particularly liked his discussions of the history of the I Ching, and the methods of getting a reading.This is an older work, though, so if you are looking for a more modern translation that ""speaks"" to you, try R. L. Wing, or Brian Browne Walker."
5,Just like in the Movie!,"I have all the ""Star Wars"" Lego sets. I have them set in little scenes and this particular one, I have three. It looks just like the one in the movie. It goes from starfighter to walking droid with about 5 REALLY easy changes. (about 8 seconds) And it goes from non-shooting starfighter to shooting starfighter in 4 rally easy changes. (about 4 seconds)Compared to the other ""Star Wars"" Lego stes, this one resembles the movie the best. Buy a couple and have a flight of droid fighters!"
1,The bandwagon trundles onwards.,What on earth is this rubbish? Is this what we've got to look forward to - complete tat with the name of a film tacked onto the box? Bring back the old Lego space sets.
5,Better than expensive brands at Sephora,I use this every day on my face because my body tends to be tanner. No one can ever tell it's not a natural tan. I do recommend scrubbing it off once a week and rebuilding your tan. I have tried many brands (many that were MUCH more expensive) and did my research- this is the best.
3,Ok,It definitely gets you darker but its an orange color and its hard to get it even everywhere. The can is only enough to use it twice.
4,Wife loved this product,"My wife purchased this product to get ready for a wedding she had to be in. Although she did tan some before using this in a tanning bed, this did help deepen and even the tan. She did not appear orange or anything like that. The ""tan"" looked pretty natural. Overall she was happy and will be purchasing this again."
5,True safe tanning,This is the best sunless tanner I've ever used. When properly applied it looks totally natural and smells really nice. It contains retinol which helps fight aging skin..it is the best.
2,Not exactly what I expected..,"I was hoping for better coverage, which it doesn't give not unless you use it excessively, although does not smudge or smear and absorbs almost instantly. One needs a lot of practice to get it evenly on, I never succeeded and looked a little like a tiger for a while...washes off easily with soap and a bit of scrubbing. The lock was a bit damaged up on arrival, but didn't affect the product."
5,Simply the best,"I am so happy and grateful that I was able to find the Visions pots on Amazon. I have been looking for years for a new set of glass pots in case something would happen to mine. Now I have spares, just in case. For the life of me I don't understand why Visions is not selling them like they used to in Target or other stores. It is a wonderful product and beats anything else on the market. Why stop making such great pots?"
5,Cheers to Good Health,"If you want to keep your glucose level in your blood in limits, and hope for healing of your neuropathy problem with feet nerves...take this product in massive doses daily...like 5 each meal...my sugar glucose levels has been in limits like 118, after eating toasted bread butter and cream cheese as much as I wanted....Alpha Lipioc Acid is good for you with diabetes 1 and 2."
2,Not the quality of other supplements,"My wife and I have been taking Natrol's 600 mg Alpha Lipoic Acid. I saw this ""deal"" on Amazon and decided to go for it. We have both noticed that the pill seemed to start dissolving about halfway down the esophagus. It distinctly burns on the way down. This was not the case with the higher dose from Natrol. I never once experienced that, but we both do with this one.I would steer clear of this one. I haven't tried everything out there, but was really happy with the Natrol."
5,Review of Alpha Lipoic Acid capsules - Purchased through Amazon.,I purchased the Swanson 300 mg (120 capsules) bottles of Alpha Lipic Acid supplements at the very end of December 2011. The bottles arrived along with another SwansonVitamins product that I had ordered at the same time. Both items were received in less than a week of being ordered. The Alpha Lipoic Acid supplment has been truly beneficial to my over all health by preventing pre-diabetic neuropathy from ever bothering me.
5,health,"I am taking for my chronic fatigue & fibromylgia, have just recently started so am unsure if product is working as I've not had much change in my pain level, however will take as directed and directed by my pain management doctor."
5,About This product .,"Let me put it to you this way i know when im taking it and i know when i'm not , i found when taking several doses at a time three times a day not only suppresses my appetite it works as a diuretic, when i first started taking it i was married to the bathroom all day and all night , and i suddenly felt lighter and 100% better than what i normally did,i swear i felt ten feet tall , and think i lost a little weight also , so i recommend this product ,it worked wonders for me.LET ME PUT"
4,Alpha-Lipoic Acid 300 mg 120 caps by Swanson Ultra,This product is comparable to the Puritan's Pride brand product of the same type. The capsules are fairly small and easy to take.
3,Restored some nerve feeling in my feet,"loss of sensitivity 10 years ago due to physical damage, but ever since I have take it I am regaining sensitivity on my feet and a reduction soreness. I recommend to all with nerve motion damage."
5,Fantastic album by an iconic group,"""Osibisa: Crisscross rhythms that explode with happiness..."" - so starts the first song on this CD and it captures the essence of the music perfectly!!!!!! I first heard this cd back in 1975 (as an album, of course), and since then it has always been present in my music collection. Osibisa, a group of African artists, have made a living fusing jazz and African rhythms into a feast for the ears. Every song on this CD sings to the soul. You'll love it - and try their other CDs also.They were big in the US for a couple of years, but they have been in Europe for the past couple of decades, touring constantly. I'm not sure if the composition of the group remains steady, but everything I hear from the group is a delight."
4,The Force Returns Again,"The eighth volume of ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" is pretty much the same as all the other DVDs starring the Omnitrix-wielding Ben, the magically-powered Gwen, and the now-mutated Kevin in 6 episodes on this DVD.In one of the episodes, Ben actually helps Vilgax (no, seriously !) defend his planet against an army of Ghostfreaks. (Remember Ghostfreak ?) And of course, ""Alien Force"" DVD would not be complete without an Alien Database that gives you specs on the certain alien heroes and villains as seen in the series.If you like Ben and the way he transform into cool creatures like Swampfire, Humongousaur, and others, then I'm sure you'll get this, plus keeping an eye out for more new episodes of ""Ben 10 Ultimate Alien"" on TV and even online with missions involving Ben in Cartoon Network's FusionFall game. Also, look for the ninth and final volume coming to DVD soon !"
5,"super photos, great text","A wonderful introduction to bamboo for anybody. This was my first ""scholarly"" book on this fascinating plant, and the background material (which generalizes to all bamboo of the world) is outstanding.So many great pictures, and so many vivid descriptions, and such erudite yet well written text.I am no scholar of bamboo, just mostly enjoy reading about plants and looking at pictures, but this should be a classic among students of bambooology I am sure."
1,Bad product,"The wide angle adapter is a complete misrepresentation. When you attach the wide angle adapter, its widening effect is eaten up by vignetting. After cropping the vignette, your are back to the normal wide angle of 28 mm. The filters are useless in wide angle. Since you have to use both adapter tubes to mount the filters, your picture will be a round view caused by the tubes.The only possible use of filters is if you have another lens with 52 mm diameter.Amazon should remove it from accessories for Olympus SP-550UZ"
1,Surprise! Made in China,"I purchased this pan last year. It wasn't until after I'd used the pan, cleaned it and returned it to its box for storage that I noticed the words ""Made in China"" printed on the side of the box. All-Clad's website touts their cookware as being made in the USA, and that's why I chose the All-Clad brand and bought this rather pricey roaster. It was very disappointing to learn the truth. Made in USA matters to me, and I feel mislead by All-Clad. The All-Clad website is vague and misleading about the source of their products - the FAQ section of their site notes that ""accessories,"" ""tools"" and ""lids"" are manufactured overseas, as well as ""non-bonded components."" What on earth are non-bonded components? An entire roasting pan? After two visits with All-Clad's customer service department, the matter is unresolved. They will not exchange the roaster for a comparable Made in USA one. Needless to say, I will not purchase All-Clad products again."
3,Better value than buying brisbane and gastanked seperately,"Good value ep combining the gastanked and brisbane eps into one with a bonus track.The gastanked songs (tracks 1-6) are fairly straight forwar indie rock without the quirkyness of later releases.the brisbane songs (tracks 7-13) show a lot more of the usual custard sound with some slower songs thrown in for good measure. Nightmare 2 especially shows glimpses of later works to come.My name is paul medew is an additional track of the band mucking around, not really a song.Overall better value buy than getting the 2 eps which are very hard to find."
3,Servings in the 4 oz. container.,"I called Swanson customer service to find this out. How many 1,500 mg. servings in the 4 oz. container? The answer: 75 servings at a 1/4 level teaspoon suggested once or twice daily. At $17 a bottle, that's .23 a serving. Hope this helps you!"
2,Disappointing Second Novel From New York Writer,"Frankly, I was disappointed by ""The Rackets"". Thomas Kelly is an engaging writer with a fairly unique view of New York City and its social components, with an easy-to-read style and a healthy sense of social commentary. Unfortunately, he has major difficulty in resolving his plotlines; Kelly's means of wrapping things up is to start eliminating major characters, and not peacefully, either. This ""last man standing"" approach to writing was also evident in his previous work ""Payback"", another engrossing novel that falls apart towards the end.Kelly is clearly an ambitious novelist, and we could sorely use a great urban novel for our time. ""The Rackets"" is not that book. One hopes that Kelly continues to grow as a writer because he certainly possesses an interesting voice. He seems to know and understand the world of which he writes, and his characters are engaging and believable. If only he could figure out where to take them in his stories."
4,Awesome,"This album is a great mix of lyrical enthusiasm and hard rocking sounds. The electronicness of it all may turn some off but it's a new step toward the music world. SERIAL P.O.P. has the makings of a great band, they just need a lot more exposure. This album is great from beginning to end with no filler inbetween. I found the band on mp3.com and later featured them in my magazine and on my website rokonline.net and have had great feedback, I love this album!"
2,TEMPORA PATET OCCULTA VERITAS!?,"Who am I to disagree with Joseph of Arimathea and Thomas Jefferson? Unfortunately however, this book didn't answer my questions but raised quite a few new ones. I doubt whether it is based on any original document. This books mixes together facts and truths with assertions that are downright nonsensical. It's an unsettling book for both neophyte and the initiate."
1,Don't buy this book!,"As another reviewer says, the author cites nothing. In my opinion too, it's made up. None of it rings true at all."
1,Makes no sense,"The entire time I was reading this, I felt like I was reading a sequel to a book I never read. Something is missing. I will keep the book on the shelf, but as of yet, I just don't get it. Unless you have some secret knowledge, don't buy this book!"
4,Creative and original but a little confusing,"Second Sight is a very creative and imaginative take on the action/shooter video game genre. The plot has twists and surprises, the controls are very smooth and intuitive, the gameplay is fun and the graphics are pretty good. But there is almost too much going on with the controller, it tends to get confusing and hard to remember where to find that certain fuction that you need RIGHT NOW, before you die, again. A good game. Rent it first to be sure it suits your style."
4,Originallity to the max... storyline at least,"This game is incredible. When I First played it on a demo, I liked it. But I can't help thinking about Timesplitters when playing this because the bulgy, comic-like character design from Free Radical is in all of their games. It makes the game a little less dramatic and more well, timesplitters. Besides that. The game brings in the psychic powers impressingly; It's not gimmicky, you can't go around and just blow up everthing and everyone but the game never forgets about your powers and there's always something new to do, whether it's levatate a gun out of a window to you, remove a wooden board blocking a door, or move a lever, and that's just Telekinesis.Free radical has a way with guns. It's so much fun to aim the gun up and press fire, I love this game and I am so happy I didn't pass this up"
1,ehh would be better if the disk worked,I don't blame the seller but the disk too scratched up to be played. I started the game and it seemed fine but once you reached a certain point about 5 min's in it just crashed and you couldn't do anything. I don't think I'll be buying from them again
3,"Eh, it's ok.","It's a beautiful pendant, but it's incredibly small. The whole thing, including the top loop, would fit inside a dime. It's beautiful, so I may have still purchased knowing this, but its size wasn't disclosed anywhere and I was just a little surprised."
1,A Real Disappointment,"This book got such promising reviews that I really expected to like it. Unfortunately, it has nothing going for it. No suspense. No real mystery. The characters are poorly drawn and developed. And the relationship between the two main characters was unbelievable and contrived. Stone needed a better editor. In all a total disappointment."
2,Completely unbelievable plot and poorly-developed characters,"I fell for the hype and I sincerely regret it. By the mid-point of the book I knew that I had purchased a dud. The characters were overdrawn to a point that was almost ludicrous, and none of the main characters were in the least bit believeably. My main point of contention, however, is with the plot. It was convoluted, confusing and completely out of touch with the reality of police work. Every twist had a twist and that got old in a hurry. If the author wishes to learn how to handle complex plots and strong female characters he needs to read somebody like David L. Lindsey and take notes."
1,I can't believe,"I can't believe anyone liked this book. It is an insult to the reader. It is poorly writen, the characters are stereo-types and not developed at all. Their internal dialogue is histrionic. This makes me wonder about the publishing world. Truely awful."
1,The worst book I've read all year and I've read a LOT,"This book is awful, the plot twists are thoroughly unbelievable. The main character is your usual woman character written by a male author, she is a drop dead gorgeous, could be a model but somehow became a policeman,and of course has the usual ""too full breasts and too slim hips"". Please, what a surprise!"
1,WRONG ITEM!!,"I ordered sling shot ammo, and by the item picture its a bag of steel marbles with a picture of a guy with a sling shot, yet all i got were water balloons. Waste of two days waiting and $10 for some water balloons"
4,Scary Fun,"Likable characters, mummies, magic, psychics and monsters blend into a fun book for adolescents and up. It's a little slow and repetitive at times but that is a minor issue. P.S. it has secret passages, my favorite LOL. I got this as a freebie but I will purchase future books in the series."
3,2.5 stars,"Moving into his ill grandfather's home brings a world of changes to Marty Boggs' young life. Starting a new school is in and of itself an experience, but that's the only normal part of it. His grandfather's nurse, Margarete, is to understate things, quite strange to the point of being creepy. Not only does she apparently have worms living in her arm, but she has overtly and tacitly threatened Marty and all he loves. Then, there's the visions Marty keeps having and a rash of kidnappings has terrified the town. All of it seems to be tied to an ancient mummy and a madman's quest for immortality. Because of his family ties, Marty is the only person in the world who can stop the nightmare.At times, be warned, this can get a little bit gross, if you are good at visualizing what happens in a book. Fans of the Young Indiana Jones or the Mummy series will stand a good chance of liking this, especially the latter.Amanda Killgore"
3,Not as good as the first two,"I just loved ""The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet""; it's my all-time favorite children's book! Its sequel, ""Stowaway to . . . "" is also good. I spent quite a bit of time dreaming about finding one of the other three Mushroom Planet books in some used bookstore, and finally happened upon this one, #3 in the series. It wasn't worth the trouble, with a somewhat contrived plot of yet another (smaller) object orbiting the earth -- though it does have some fine drawings in it. Stick with Cameron's first two books."
4,"Good, but not the best the series has to offer......","This is fun to read simply because of the time period it was written in--the late 50's. You can enjoy the innocence of the 50's before America went to space firsthand. This series was written by Eleanor Cameron on the prompting of her son. I agree with the other reviewer--this is not the best book the series has to offer. The illustrations are very good though. I say if you enjoy nostalgia and great writing, you will want to read this book and the rest in the series."
5,A True Inspiration,"For those who imagine librarians are like what could have happened to the Donna Reed character if _A Wonderful Life_ hadn't, this volume demonstrates the engagement and vitality of library workers. They collect materials and then present them so that the public can make sense of information and knowledgeably take action. Beyond serving as a search engine, librarians find and deliver to their clienteles an array of useful, entertaining, and educational resources. Ours is a complex world, and we can appreciate assistance the library gives in understanding it._A True Politician_ chronicles the life of a librarian who held true to her job as a member of her community. It also offers a hint of romance. I'm glad that I read this inspiring book."
4,"Useful, creative","This book has simple, up-to-date designs that can be easily customized. It also offers many ideas for using parts of designs for other projects.I'm ordering it to make a wedding sampler for my son and his fiancee, but will also use it for other gifts.The samplers incorporate traditional motifs, but with modern color schemes."
2,quality shopper,this bra is so uncomfortable that i would not order it again and i am going to return it. the first time i wore it the wire that is under the arm poked loose and sticks you painfully. be aware that it has a super amount of wiring for a sports bra. i would not reccomend this to a friend.
2,Microsoft Encarta 2000 Fails to live up to Expectations,"Microsoft Encarta 2000 turns out to be nothing more than a child's toy. It lacks quality in several areas. First, no map indicates what projection is being used. This makes it hard to figure out the level and type of distortion in each map. Secondly, the climate and annual rainfall maps are poor. It is impossible to zoom in on one country for these types of maps. The closest view you can get is a much to far out to obtain any real data. The program would be a fun method to teach young children about political geography, but after that the software is almost useless. Overall i would have to say that no proffesional cartographer would be able to get useful information from Encarta, but the novice geographer might have two or three hours of fun listening to the national anthems of different countries."
2,could have been better...,"I love Heath's books and especially her cowboy/gentleman series, and I actually had to wait a really long time for this particular book. I am sad to say that I was disappointed. I loved Kit from the very beginning of the books, and I still love him in this one, however it is the female lead that disappoints me. I'm used to strong leads, or at least ones that grow some sort of back bone so that they compliment their partners, in this book she didn't even come close to doing so, acting differently than a miss when they were in danger. Otherwise, she spent her time bemoaning her death, which admittedly gets tiresome. I don't know, the storie killed my enthusiasm for the book, as did Kit's almost imidiate love for her. It's a sweet story, don't get me wrong, but it's too sweet for me."
4,Review,Loved the Rogues in Texas series. Great story and great author. Thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't wait to start the next one
1,PLAGIARISM AT ITS WORST,"Dear Dr. Petermann,The only good thing about your book is that it is wonderful work THE ESOTERIC TRADITION of G de Purucker Copyrighted in 1935. HIS WORDS ARE MAGNIFICENT. Yours are the obvious plagiarism which a man of your qualifications should be totally ASHAMED. HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO WRONG WITH THE WORDS OF A TRUE TEACHER OF ANCIENT WISDOM?"
1,"Isn't this G. De Purucker's 2 Vol. opus ""The Esoteric Traditon?""","Maybe I'm missing something or this is some kind of copyright or reprint loophole, but credit should be given where credit is due, and in this case it does not seem to be. This author's 2 volume series ""The Esoteric Sciences"" was already written and published long ago by the learned theosophical author G. De Purucker under the title of ""The Esoteric Tradition."" The table of contents for both author's volumes is identical and de Purucker's came first. So ... what's up?Buyer Beware.What's next? A reissue of ""Genesis"" or the ""Illiad"" under a different title?Am I missing something or just seeing the obvious?"
1,The Esoteric Tradition By G. de Purucker is for sale here on Amazon.com & is public domain,"I hope to see this on Project Gutenberg & on Amazon as a free book, as it seems it should be.This book, G. de Purucker's, is in Public domain.If you want a copy of G. de Purucker's work from 1935, apparently the original, please go to Pasadena'sTheosophical University Press (Online Edition) and download it for free!Here's the link to download it for FREE...http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/et/et-hp.htmThe publisher's (Trafford's) Reese Bradley (customer support) was notified and a knowledged reading the complaints re: plagiarism here on Amazon and stated she would contact the author who she states is solely responsibly, via contract, for the content.Amazon.com needs to take a look at this, and if plagiarism exists, needs to pull this listing & the other volume of this book should it exist there as well."
4,Boston's Brahman Bloodsuckers?,"Very interesting historical account of the ""lost"" Swift River valley which became the Quabbin Reservoir, Boston's public drinking water supply. The story of the flood and the lives it erased forever from the new england landscape. History, tragedy, ""progress.""""In our blest Home Eternal, there'll be no projects great. To scatter neighbors left and right, we've passed it's golden gate. No mansions there, will be laid low, beneath the wrecker's maul; 'Twill be a happy Commonwealth, with room enough for all."" Mabel L. Jones"
3,Mostly for beginners,"The only sections of this book of interest to me were the ones about how to turn jewelry making into a business and the top 10 lists. I think those were informative and well written. However, the chapters with step by step projects in them and the photos of finished pieces were lacking. Wire spirals and most of the photos of wire work should show nice, even, and smooth shapes, not bent and kinked looking ones. I know this is for beginners but let's start them out on the right asthetic foot at least. I would never buy any of the featured pieces, that's for sure."
4,"Helpful, Hopeful, Happy","I have used this book so many times I actually have post-it flags on many of the pages. Whenever in doubt, I pull this book out. It has been most helpful in starting my beading experience and still find it most useful."
1,A complete and utter waste of money,"This book is of no help at all. At least it was not for me. I knew almost everything in this book from watching youtube videos on jewelry making. But I figured you can't know too much about anything. But this book will only confuse you. Keep watching online videos for ""free"" and you will learn more then this book can ever teach you...trust me."
1,Jewelry making for Dummies,Not good! I was hoping for ideas for beginners. I'm not to creative and thought it might have some examples or ideas. Totally dissapointed.
3,"OK, but could be better","The book is a good general introduction. It could be much better if the illustrations were more helpful. The verbal descriptions can be confusing, and many times the graphics are just too simple/lacking in detail to be of much help.But, beyond this, it has quite a bit of good information, but you may have to reread carefully to gain full understanding."
5,Jewelry Making For Dummies,"I am very pleased with my book. If any one want to learn the basics of jewelry making, start here.I am also pleased with the company who sent my book. Very Prompt. Book was In Great condition."
1,Jewelry Making & Beading for Dummies,Step by step pictures are hard to follow. Most of the instructions are described not shown. Only a few color photos. Book was extremely boring.
3,Not for the beginner,"I like the ""Dummies: series because they usually do not assume that you have any prior knowledge of the subject. This is not like the other books in the series. This book assumes the reader already has some experience making jewelry. I did learn a few things, but many new terms were not explained and I had to look up the meaning somewhere else. Since I have never made jewelry before, I wanted to learn the basics but many were not there."
2,Old and out-of-date,Should have checked the pub date on this before buying. Many other books are much better. Photos and illustrations are mostly in b&w thruout book but there are color ones in the middle.
5,JEWELRY MAKING & BEADING FOR DUMMIES,"THE TITLE IS ENOUGH. IT HELPS YOU TO TAKE EACH PAGE AND USE IT IN YOUR STUDIES, I AM A BEADER AND HAVE LEARNED A LOT. THANK YOU FOR THE IDEAL."
2,A Few Great Ideas... And some Really Bad Ones,"What the author has to say about guarding your eyes and not staring at women is great (helped me a lot). But I felt like when I had completed the book, that as a male I was the problem. The book spells out that men initiate sexually related problems in relationships and women are not sexually inclined (if at all minimally). Many of my male youth group kids who read this novel agreed it left them feeling confused about the opposite gender. This idea creates an unrealistic picture of female sexuality and character (sadly not all women are completely innocent). A more balanced view would be that sexual problems are caused by both people in the relationship making mistakes.In short I wish that I had never read this book because it set me up to enter into an extremely disastrous relationship. I will never recommend this book to anyone and always discourage its usage."
4,Good advice for the fight for purity,"This book will not solve your problems, but will help any young man who is trying to be pure and honor the Lord in his fight against sexual temptation. The book comes up with an awesome game plan, learning how to ""bounce your eyes"", and ""starve the sumo"", which is the euphemism for a sex drive.I think this book is less about arguing about where desires come from, but about how serious God is about purity, how we all deal with it, and what it takes to prevail. Ignore some of the other negative reviews, I don't know where they got what they got."
2,Rename this book,"The book might help you get over porn addiction but it will certainly help you become a self-righteous fundamentalist. In one instance the author chastises a friend for NOT noticing the sexual innuendos in a movie. So who went home justified? The Pharisee or the Publican? He also blames women for wearing short skirts.This book, like religion, will make your life more difficult and happiness elusive. I regret buying this book."
4,At last! An honest discussion for Christian sexuality!,"Honest to goodness discussion regarding sexuality from a Christian man's point of view! Amazing. The authors are evangelical in nature, encouraging readers to integrate sexuality and faith in Jesus.As a youth leader, we have already used this in several discussions in an effort to help our guys feel free to discuss and be free to speak their minds. It is very readable, and could even be used for a group study. Our students need this!This is not a perfect book, sometimes it feels as though there are many broad generalizations. However, it is frank in its content, not glossing over important issues, as so many ""Christian"" books on sexuality seem to do. I respect the authors for thier work."
2,not for every young man,"I bought this book for my 14 yr. old son. I was disappointed to see that the authors use titilating language to describe their own experiences of the past. I definitely think this is inappropriate for my son. My husband (who has admittedly dealth with pornographic issues)agreed that the language used was much too strong and tempting. I would like to have seen the authors try to achieve the same goal without all the vivid descriptions of their experiences. I believe it's enough to say, ""I've been there."" Using alluring adjectives to describe where you've been is not always the best way to accomplish keeping others from the darkness. If you choose to get this book, take heed. My son won't be reading it by my recommendation."
2,"Good, but drags your mind through the gutter","While containing helpful strategies and ideas, unfortunately the writers drag your mind through the gutter as they graphically discuss accounts of sexual discovery. One teenager I disciple recently told me this book actually caused him to stumble more, since it put new ideas in his mind! Parents and youth leaders should carefully screen this book because it can do more do more harm than good for certain teens.A healthy alternative that contains an even stronger biblical basis, that avoids the graphic descriptions, and that is much shorter (making it much more likely for teens to read it) is Joshua Harris' ""Not Even A Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust."" This book is based on the truth of Ephesians 5:3. It has also been re-released as ""Sex is Not the Problem, Lust Is."" I have led several teenage guys in studies of it and all have found it very beneficial in honoring the Lord in the area of their sexuality."
5,The truth,"This book is plain truth and its a hard read, but it's on point, and when I was done reading it I was a better man. It's amazing transformational material."
5,North Buxton is Unique,"I still remember fondly the first trip I made to the town of North Buxton, Ontario. Back in the late 1960s, it was like taking a step back in time. As an outsider, an American, and a big-city girl, I had never experienced anything quite like it. The town had one stop light. The Post Office was housed in the same building as the general store and the only garage/filling station in town. My former husband was related to the Shadd family. His Aunt Saxonia was a school teacher and the town's Post Mistress. Her husband ran the general store and the all the rest. The town's history is fascinating; and I remember a trip to the museum and seeing the dedication plaque given to the town by Queen Elizabeth. A trip to Buxton should be mandatory for anyone who wants to learn more about history, slavery, hope and resilience. It is not far from Detroit, so you should make the effort. I am certain you will not be disappointed."
5,Wonderful book from childhood...,This book is out of print but is a fabulous collection of fairy tales. We had both volumes when I was a child and I read them over and over. My children love these books now and I purchase them when I see a good price to use for gifts.
5,A true childhood treasure,"I have been looking for this book for ten years! My grandparents had both this book and the second treasury and they were the first things I headed for when I went to visit them. I spent many fond hours reading the fairy tales, which has a great collection of classic Brothers Grimm as well as many lesser known tales, and memorizing the details of every picture. When I had my own children, I wanted to share these books with them, but I couldn't remember the title or publisher. I could never find it on the internet. Finally, I found volume one at a used children's goods store and I am ecstatic! Now that I know the title, I plan on getting the other one right away. The pictures and font may seem a little dated (they were printed in the seventies), but they are still appealing and the writing is excellent."
5,A Beautiful Story for Everyone....,"I really love this book and as another user has stated I think every family should have even they aren't going through a loss. This is one of the only stories for kids I've read dealing with those left behind by death. The death occurs very early in the story and the rest is about his friends over coming their sadness and learning to live without him while still remembering him. This would be a good story for kids experiencing the death of a loved one despite your religion or situation. This book does not use religious subject and the cause of Fox's death is not really specified (illness due to old age or a disease ending his life early) so it can be interpreted however you wish. Regardless I think everyone should own a copy, I'm 20 and adore it!!!"
4,Great for those starting out and DJs looking for new horizons.,"First off if you're a Mac user, then as they say, there's nothing to see here - move along. That said if you're a PC user or don't care either way then you'll get something out of this book.Yes it pretty much a book that focuses exclusively on Sony Acid, but what's wrong with that? Acid is probably one of the best known packages for PC and is certainly a good jumping off point for those entering the Mashup/Remix domain for the first time.The book does assume a certain working knowledge of Acid, so if you've never ever laid hands on Acid, I suggest before getting too deep into this book that you get some fundamental experience on Acid then come back to this book.Overall I found the book easy to follow and it gets done what needs to be done. Those with remix/mashup experience already will probably not rate this book that highly however if you're learning or want to refresh and get another perspective, then this book will serve you well."
4,Sony Acid How To,"I was a little misled at first I was thinking that this would give you different options on what computer software to use to create mash-ups/remixes, but the author very much favors Sony's Acid. It is basically a how to for Sony's Acid music editing software. The author goes very deep into music producing theory which at times was a little over my head but I found the book to be very useful and helpful. Whether or not the purpose of the book was to make people go out and purchase Sony's Acid I don't know. But I can say that I did end up buying the program and am very satisfied with it and this book."
1,Non-Mac compatible expanded Mashups using Sony Acid instructions,"I got this for Christmas today and was excited.Until I opened it up.It's all PC all the time, no Mac in sight.I thought maybe I can still read it and apply the theory to Ableton Live. Uh, no. It's all about Sony and only details the ins and outs of 3 PC only programs.Great if you're a PC guy maybe, but leaves us Mac people high and dry."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dont waste your time on this lame book it was obviously written by a tool who has figured out a way to get sony acid to pay him as this book is a marketing ploy pushing crappy software! As for everything else relative to DJ'ing, mixing,remixing etc. the dude is a clueless computer dork!It sucks!!!!!!! I feel bad for anyone who has paid for this useless book........"
5,Ben Hur/The King of Kings,"It took the company three tries to send the correct second movie, but they were EXTREMELY nice about it, they did not charge us the shipping to correct the error and both items still arrived before the deadline even with the corrections! I would do business with them again."
3,"Cute, but a little redundant.","This is a cute little book, but I share many of the other reviewer's criticisms--the book contains a lot of repeat information from the other Samantha books. The projects are fun though! Also, it is not laid out as ""scrapbook-like"" as I anticipated an American Girls book like this would be (aka Kit's Railroad Adventure--this one is much less real scrapbook like). I think it is still nice to have in a collection of Samantha books though!"
1,What on earth is the appeal of this stuff?,"Wretched, simply wretched. Jangly, oh-so-earnest whitebread college guitar pop. Retread Beatles arrangements and lyrics salvaged from Toad the Wet Sprocket's dumpster. I saw this band at a local bar recently and my new hobby is hating them."
3,Dramatic skits to enliven faith,"In his book, Jerry Robbins asks sophisticated questions simply, but he does not provide simple answers. Rather, in entertaining dialogues, lucid meditations, and provocative discussion starters, he helps the reader relax into thought and conversation about God's role in suffering, death, forgiveness, miracles, technology, and more. John Hougen"
1,Skip this book!,"This author pushes his personal and anthropological views on his reader in a big way. Had this book not been a required text for a class, I would have put it down after the first chapter. This is not a linear book, meaning Brody skips around sometimes over periods of years while recalling his experiences. It is a boring read and Brody is pushy with his ideas, to an almost sickening degree. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
3,Only good if you like covers,"Note: These are all covers of the popular hits you heard on the radio or the danceclub. Boys, if you want the originals, keep looking. The main lure is the hot cover boy."
4,"""...a man who's legs are bent and paralized""","""Ruby don't take your love to town"" was the first 45RPM single I ever bought. I have search for a couple years now for some ""First Edition"" but haven't been lucky until I came across this CD on Amazon. Glad I made the purchase. ""Ruby"" is still a great song and, boy, ""Just walked in..."" is a real rocker. Love it."
1,Window Tint,This product was cheap but horrible. It went straight into the trash. The film was purple and cheap looking and did not stick to the windows at all.
1,Strange Measurements for U.S.,"This is a neat looking book - designed so that any combination of starters, main meals and desserts can be viewed all on the same page. However, unless you know what a ""rasher of bacon"" is and have food scales for grams - this book will be of no use to you."
3,Accessory Set,This set is great as an accessory to any of the Trade Federation battle sets from Lego. The STAPs are a wonderful addition.You will get yet another Jar Jar and Qui-Gon figure but that isn't a problem - there are many other uses for them.An excellent option - but not a must have.
3,Naboo Swamp,"For the price, this is not worth the money. I was expecting a big box with lots of Lego to come, instead it was a small 4 inch by 4 inch box. I got this because it was on my grandson's wish list for Christmas. He was okay with it, but surprised that it was so little also. Ususally it takes him an hour or so to put together new Lego sets, this was put together in 5 minutes. I really feel we were duped."
1,Piece of Junk,"This Item is a piece of Junk! It's made in China so you know what that means,right? It states in instructions to shoot 500 times before sighting in. It should shoot right out of the box but it doesn't. I recommend the engineers to go back to drawing board and try again."
1,not what i exspected,"not happy , tore first day i got them , i tried putting the face mask on an it ript never got a chance to try it :("
4,Nice for small batches of sauces,"Worked very well when whipping up a roux. The heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and didn't scorch. The rounded sides meant that I had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan. Cleaned up easily and looks really nice. Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.The main downside is that at 1 quart, it is not as useful if you need to cook for more than 2-4 people.Note to the person who had the pan discolor: simply sprinkle a little bit of ""Barkeeper's Friend"" in the pan and rub with a damp sponge. I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like-new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny."
2,"""Signature handle"" too heavy","This pot won't stay flat, the 'emeril signature design' handle is too heavy so it topples. What a pity for such a nice-looking pot with acclaimed high quality stainless (it is made by All-Clad). How can such basic design flaw be overlooked? I can't rate the cooking quality because as soon as I couldn't get it to stay flat on its bottom there was no way I could even put anything in it. Returned it immediately. Tested several other units in the store, same problem."
2,Not for tomato-based sauces,"The interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back."
5,Superb!,"This is no ordinary volume of poetry. It is beautifully written, possessing the power to captivate the imagination, as well as the heart and soul, of any reader who has ever truly been in love."
5,A picture is worth a thousand cookies!,"People are never happy with their picture, but if these cookies could talk, they would say they look just like their pictures! Unlike some cookie books, these treats taste even better than they look. The book is easy to follow. The directions are given in order, very clearly. This book will neither confuse the beginner, nor bore the more seasoned baker. Co-workers drop at my feet on days that I bring Rose's cookies in to work! My paychecks do not swell, but my ego does, just for being able to turn out these great cookies. If you want to ""eat life"" as they say, a good place to start is with this book.bcameron@digital.net<BR"
3,Can anyone get these recipes to work?!?!,"Well, it's the second Christmas in a row that I have ventured to make cookies from this recipe book. Last year's ""Mexican Wedding Cakes"" cookies were a total disaster----couldn't even get a dough to form. Today I made the ""Mom's Coconut Kisses"" with some degree of success, but baking time was too long and I burnt the first batch. What is with these recipes? I am a decent cook, can certainly follow directions, and yet keep getting disappointed. Perhaps you will have better luck than I.The book has photos of all of the recipes, which is nice, but is very wordy in terms of directions: the author includes every imaginable way of mixing the cookies and lists specific directions for each. While helpful, it makes each recipe look quite daunting.I'm sure there are many other recipe books that include just as many nice recipes but actually work...."
5,Amazing Cookie book,"I have used this book for years. The directions are expicit and easy to follow. The tips are very helpful. The layout of each recipe is excellent. I have made many of the recipes. If you are looking for a book with sophisticated cookies, this and Flo Braker's Sweet Minatures are great choices."
5,Mahogany Buttercrunch Fix,"I love this book, too, even though mine is in pieces. The problem with the buttercrunch is this: Once it comes to the boil, you must use a clean spoon each time you stir. I don't stir it often at that point, but when I do, I use a new spoon. If there is any sugar on the spoon, the whole thing will crystallize."
5,My favorite cookie book,"As others have said, this is my favorite and most-used cookie book (for all year round). In fact, I signed up to be a reviewer just for this book. I always like to know the reasons behind why a recipe works and why you need to use certain ingredients, and the author always explains these things. Add to that the great pictures, storage information (very important if you bake ahead of your event), and personal stories, and that's why this book is such a pleasure to use. Everything I've tried has come out the way I expected it."
3,Cookies,I found this book disappointing compared to the Cake Bible. I have worked extensively with both books and the Cake Bible's recipies are far more sound. I am a huge fan of Beranbaum's work but the cookies just don't taste nearly as good as the cakes do.
3,A bit disappointing,"I think I have all of Rose Beranbaum's books and, I must say that this one is a bit disappointing. I expected more of a variety of recipes...not lemon bars, brownies, and Mexican wedding cookies...which are in EVERY BAKING BOOK available..."
4,used the sugar cookie recipe and it was fine,"I also used the royal icing recipe and made a bizillion cookies for Christmas presents. The recipe worked fine. I'm not quite sure why there was so much space used for the gingerbread cathedral, but, well, if I ever want to make a gingerbread cathedral, I'm all set! I appreciate that all recipes use weights as well as volume, since I've shifted over to weighing when I bake--it was really useful when I needed to figure out how much of my big bowl of egg whites to use in the royal icing. One note--she frequently references a particular website for supplies that is no longer in business (I forget now which one) but if you look for that site on Google it will take you to the new company that sells the same stuff."
4,Rose is the best,"Rose Beranbaum, the author, must simply love what she does. All of her books just shine with enthusiasm and mirth. Couple that with her precision and good taste and you have wonderful recipes, every time. There are full-color photos accompanying every single recipe, and Beranbaum's comments are truly fun and memorable.The cookies range from homespun to exotic. One of the exotic cookies that I love is the delicate snowflakes made out of meringue. She also has the BEST homemade dog biscuit recipe I have ever made. Dogs will do absolutely anything in their power to get these biscuits!!The cookies in this book are ones that you would serve to your most exalted guests, but most are easy enough to make any time, so don't wait for Christmas, use it all year round."
5,Cookie Wonderland,"Rose did an excellent job choosing the recipes for this book. Some recipes could be difficult to make if you are a beginner, but if you are an adventurous baker, I am sure you will be happy to get this book. The instructions are clear, every recipe has a picture of the final cookie, all in all it is a very beautiful book to have. I have collected all of her cookbooks, and this is one of my favorites."
5,Wonderful!,"The Fraser Haas duo is wonderful. They're a perfect team that blend both instruments in a spirited array of music choices. I own one of their other cds (In the Moment), which is another one I've really enjoyed listening to and this is another great selection of Scottish reels and waltzes that will add to our collection. You won't be disappointed with either of these titles!"
4,amazon delivery rating,"On an order made on 7/11/07, delivery finally occurred on 8/8/07 after numerous phone calls and a reorder. Price was great, if I could have even come within $10 I would have purchased it elsewhere."
5,"Earl Gaines, Crankshaft Blues & My Experience","My review of Earl Gaines CD, Crank Shaft Blues, and my Amazon ExperienceI enjoyed the ability to purchase this item on Amazon. The music was something that I came accross previously, and wondered where I could obtain it. Crankshaft Blues speaks to me, and allows me to enter a world that I physically have not lived in. Music has that ability to speak and transport you to places within our spirits."
1,"Puritan mets the Devil, guess who wins?","While full of colorful stories, the book reads in what can best be described as farcical puritanical pomposity. I had a hard time keeping a straight face while the brave Presbyterian minister forces himself to drink strong whiskey and watch can-can dancers lift their skirts. Oh, it was so horrible!, but our fearless leader held his drink with the best of men.I'm sorry, but this isn't history, it is pure wishful thinking. Drawing a puritanical line between good and evil is hardly useful for understanding what makes New York tick."
2,The Good The Bad And The Ugly,"I mixed bag of tracks, from good to bad and live recordings, I'm sure you could find a better compilation of Muddy Waters to spend your money on than this! yet another crappy issue from the MasterSong Label"
1,It was a dark and stormy night...,"If you ever wondered where that phrase came from, this is the book. Other than that, there just isn't much here."
3,Review of Garfinkle's 'Celestial Matters',"Garfinkle offers a great idea with adequate results. Celestial Matters is an insightful, learned analysis of Greek culture. However it doesn't have much to say about human culture in general. What I always look for in alternative histories is anthropological reasoning. Why are things this way? What human qualities caused these changes? Overall, Garfinkle presents too many characters without enough depth to make this a very memorable read."
3,Interesting Conceit,"Interesting concept, it's just that the writing doesn't quite keep up with the inventivness of the central idea. I expected a little more here than one is given here, and I have to say you might want to try another SF writer."
2,"Interesting idea, but poor execution","I just could not get involved in this novel; I never quit books but this one I gave up on. The characters were flat and lifeless; I wanted to like this book after all of the rave reviews I read.The book's premise is very creative in which ancient Greek worldviews are accurate; the author takes us to the future with glowing moon rocks, spaceships powered by liquid fire and gold, the celestial bodies rotate around earth, etc. Very ambitious science fiction novel, but unfortunately it was boring and I could not get interested in the narrative. Interesting idea, but poor execution by the author."
4,Science Fantasy with Intrigue & Action,"Set in a world where Alexander the Great's empire has lasted 1,000 years and Ptolemeic speculations are scientific fact, this is part alternate-history, part alternate-science. The story concerns a celestial ship (spaceship) of the Delian league (who control the world from India to halfway across the Americas) which is embarking on a mission to gather a piece of the sun in order to use it as a sort of atomic bomb against the capital of the Middle Kingdom (an oriental empire which they have been at constant war with). Written as the testimony of a co-captain of the ship, the story relates this adventure, complete with scheming, betrayals, setbacks, and crises of faith, while also presenting a vivid and interesting alternate world. Enjoyment would be aided by a solid understanding of the beliefs (scientific and otherwise) of the ancient Greeks, but should be enjoyable for anyone."
5,Excellent book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The plot itself was exciting and had a few good twists toward the end. I liked how he created a world that is governed by the four elements (earth, air, fire and water) and the Earth is at the center of the universe. Really interesting alternate world novel."
2,"some good recipes, but nothng more","I wish I had a chance to browse this book before I bought it. I was also hoping for some guidance on how long to cook various cuts of meat and so on. While there is a little of that, it's scattered among various recipes and not very useable. Should really be called ""Grilling Recipes for Dummies""."
1,Not for Dummies,"This is a Grilling Cookbook. Not a book about grilling for dummies. I had never grilled before and this book goes off about sauces and marinades, when I just wanted to start by putting a slab of meat or a hot dog on the grill.Needless to say, I was lost and confused before I got the gas connected (which it doesn't help you with, either BTW).It was totally useless for me."
4,Recipes Galore!,"- and - if you can't find one to fit, alter one to make do. I love the quick reference chart in front and decide which grill to use based on what GFD says (charcoal for long sessions, gas for a quick burger or chop). Disappointed that Amazon is only selling the second edition; the 3rd has been out for awhile."
3,Grilling for Dummies,To the amatuear griller there is allot of information in here you probably already know. There are however allot of good receipes.
4,"Got For Wife, but Hasn't Used it","Still waiting to get final connections to new grill. Wife hasn't made it a priority, but this is to help her use gill more effectively. Will See what happens."
5,Most Amazing TV Show Ever Made,"I cannot stop watching this show over and over again. The acting is brilliant, the plots are so well translated into modern times, and the action is perfectly timed. It helps that Benedict Cumberbatch is utterly incredible as Sherlock. I would recommend this to anyone, even if they don't know the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle times."
5,Superb television,"It would ordinarily be hard to say what the best part of this 'update' of Sherlock Holmes is; the title character is played well and thoughtfully, Lestrade is a thoroughly professional conventional detective, and the supporting characters are engaging without being distracting. However, the most surprising and impressive element of 'Sherlock' is easy to point out: the character and acting for Doctor Watson. The character development is outstanding, and the understated acting is genius. The series emphasizes Watson's contributions to Holmes' detection and managing of his weaknesses, reminding us of why Conan-Doyle wrote of a team."
5,A Newer Smarter Sherlock,"If you are a fan of any of the past Sherlocks, keep your seat belt tightened.... this one will take your a wild ride. After seeing the first episode on Masterpiece Theatre I had to buy the DVD. The 2nd and 3rd episodes continued filling out the characters of Holmes and Watson in the 21st century. At first I didn't think this could work but the fast paced writing and the superb acting makes this series a ""must see."" Finally, someone is giving the viewer some credit for having a brain and the glimpses of humor are excellent."
5,Great BBC series,"Great BBC series. The firse episode is the best of the three, but all are great. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Definitely worth owning."
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this series, my boyfriend introduced it to me and I was hooked! Excellent adaptation of Doyles work and really enjoyable."
5,Love Sherlock,Fantastic show! One of my new favorites so glad that amazon offered this so that we can watch it. Between this and Doctor Who I am one happy camper.
3,It's OK....not great,"I like it, but it can get a bit monotonous. The stories are good, the characters are likable but the plot sometimes has too many loose ends - and not in a good way."
3,"Not great, but still entertaining","Not wild about the selection of actors to play Sherlock Holmes, but the storylines are interesting and the acting is good."
4,Better than the movie,"Unlike Guy Ritchie's re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes this is actually very watchable. I watched it with my nine-year-old daughter and we both very much enjoyed it. This vision of Sherlock, while updated to modern times, is much more true to the original than Ritchie's action movie garbage. I would recommend it."
3,"Great Show, Terrible Sound (Download Version Only)","Unlike some reviewers here, I loved this contemporary adaptation of Sherlock Holmes and hope we'll be seeing more in the future. And ""The Great Game,"" the third and final episode of the first season was the best of the lot.That being said, the downloaded version I purchased had absolutely terrible sound. The bass had been stripped away, giving even explosions a thin and tinny sound. And the midrange (where voices are) was so muddy that much of the dialogue was unintelligible.Note that I saw this episode on PBS and the sound was fine. And since getting my unsatisfactory download, I've found another copy which - again - had perfectly good sound.There are apparently no refunds for download purchases like this, so I highly recommend that you DO find and enjoy ""The Great Game"" (and the rest of the series)...but not the Amazon download. My 3 star rating is 5 stars for the program...and 1 star for the audio quality."
5,a must see,"Excellent interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, remains faithful to Doyle's writings and melds the original stories well in present day England. Cumberbatch portrays the cerebral anti-hero to perfection, both immensely likable and frustrating. The editing and camerawork to show the character's thought process, received text messages, etc. is well done, and an interesting way to convey plot lines without having cumbersome dialogue for explanations. Overall, a very well executed and entertaining update on Sherlock Holmes."
5,So good! Can't wait to watch more,"Can't wait to watch more! Clever writing, good acting, realistic plots and great use of humor. Amazing tie in to the original Sherlock Holmes."
4,A Great Watch,"The recent Guy Ritchie version of Sherlock Holmes got me interested in the character and universe of the London detective. Unfortunately, the film can only go so far. I decided to check this out based on my prior knowledge of creator Steven Moffat, and I was blown away by this modern day reimagining. Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as the Myopic Sleuth, combining an almost endless tech knowledge with a great wit. Martin Freeman, on of my favorite British actors, is the standout as Dr. John Watson, an Afghanistan War Veteran back in London after an injury on the battlefield. Una Stubbs and Zoe Telford are also entertaining as supporting characters, and the setting gives a unique atmosphere. My one complaint is that episode 2, The Blind Banker, is tedious, and less entertaining than episodes 1 and 3. Other than that minor issue, this set is a must buy."
5,Gripping and Cinematic,"Pitch-perfect performances and brilliant, complex storytelling that requires a second viewing to really appreciate. I've watched and enjoyed the series online many times, but its cinematic feel calls for the Blu-ray."
5,Wow. Stunning.,"This is without a doubt the best new series since Mad Men. Each episode is a movie of its own, beautifully shot, cleverly written, wonderfully executed. The only complaint possible to level against this one is that there is not nearly enough of it. I cannot wait for more."
5,Draws you in and holds you,"Amazing actors. You forget where you are. I don't like many murder mysteries, but this one has such nuance it's more about human nature than just gore or thrill seeking. Leaves a smile on your face."
5,Region.,I love this show a lot and want to buy them. I live in the US and was wondering if these are region locked? The ones on the BBC shop are but are these?
5,Rewatching season 1 while waiting on season 2,"This series has been successfully set in modern-day London with great ties from the original books. While it was fun to watch for Sir Authur Conan Doyle's original descriptions, I soon got lost in the adventure. Highly recommend! Can't wait for Season 2!"
5,he's baaaaaack!,"Who knew? This Sherlock emerges quite seamlessly into our 21st century with his outstanding deductive and observational skills - complete with hi-tech mastery. Dr. Watson has evolved rather fittingly and has actually become a more intriguing character this time around. Writing and directing are amazingly rooted in Doyle's original ideas, yet keep modern audiences enrapt with the fast-paced, hard-biting style of crime fiction on television and film screens to which we have become accustomed."
5,Brilliant rethink.,"This is a brilliant re-think of Sherlock Holmes. Moffat has kept the true feel of the stories, while updating it to the modern era. His talent with story and dialogue shows through here, making it funny, but still action packed (like Dr. Who). I enjoy both characters very much, who also keep true to the stories. I cannot wait to see more."
5,The best iteration of Sherlock Holmes,"My girlfriend just gave me this series as well as series 2 for birthday presents. I'm pretty stoked because I got what I asked for. Not only as gifts, but as a fan of the show and stories. This show is immaculate on Blu-Ray. There is the original pilot and audio commentary tracks as well as a behind the scenes feature that's about 40 minutes long. I love everything about this show, the modern and contemporary setting, the actors, the cinematography, the music, everything. I think Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock Holmes since Peter Cushing and Martin Freeman is the best Watson to date. I can see why Peter Jackson cast them as Smaug the Dragon and Bilbo Baggins respectively, in his forthcoming The Hobbit trilogy. I highly recommend this to any fan of suspense thriller mysteries and well shot and acted shows. And the fact that each episode is 90 minutes is great, granted there is only three episodes a series. I cannot wait to re-watch this series."
1,Good movie,"I did not purchase this movie, I just watched it on Amazon. I like Sherlock, this young Sherlock is good."
5,Sher-locked.,This is one of the better takes on Sherlock I have come across. They mix the mystery with the adventure and do an amazing job at showing you exactly how this brilliant mind works.I recommend this show for everyone.
5,A Great Series,"I really enjoyed this modernized version of the Sherlock Homes story. Having been to London several times, I enjoy stories taking place in locations I've visited. Wonderful acting as well."
4,Nice take on an old standard,"Compared to the other version of Doyle's franachise playing on network television, this one is fresher, with the characters quirky to the extreme, and funny in that wry way the British have honed ever since the Normans came across the channel..."
5,Exceeded expectations,"A friend at work encourage me to watch this show, and I found it absolutely enchanting. The production values, writing and acting all exceeded my expectations. All Sherlock fans must watch this series."
4,I LOVE SHERLOCK,Obviously an awesome show. I adore it. Amazon let me download it quickly and hassle free but the quality isn't the greatest. It isn't bad though.
5,Love the modern Sherlock Holmes,The invigorated twist to the new Sherlock Holmes proved insightful embracing the same baffling brillance as contained in the older series. Sherlock is still the smartest guy in the room bar none. You will watch the series again and again to detect what you missed in the first playing of each and every segment. Love it.
5,"Vastly Superior to ""Elementary""","Because I dislike the U.S. show ""Elementary"" so much, I nearly missed out on this show. On a radio recomendation, I bought it, without ever having seen an episode. It turns out, it is not the putting of Holmes and Watson in the 21st Century that I did not like about ""Elementary,"" but the acting, writing and direction in that very inferior show.Sherlock is the update done right. It has very good writing, acting and directing. It was interesting to see how they even improved the very good Pilot in the first episode, lengthened, redo.While I like a little longer season, when the quality is this high, I cannot complain too much. I am usually opposed to making major changes to established characters, however, Sherlock does not harm, in any way, the spirit of the original characters. This is good TV!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"First off, I am a diehard fan of the Jeremy Brett/Granada series. I bought this for my wife, assuming I would be forced to sit and stew whilst some new director transmogrified my favorite literary character beyond recognition. To my surprise, I very much enjoy this series. The actor playing Sherlock obviously did his homework and actually does a very nice job of making Holmes his ""own character"" while at the same time channeling Brett by his facial expressions, movements, and vocal cadence. Witty, funny, and intriguing.The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the ending to episode 1 is quite lame.....all I could think of was Princess Bride ""clearly I cannot chose the cup in front of me.""I eagerly await purchasing the second season. Why can;t they make funny, witty, intelligent shows like this in the U.S.?"
5,The Better Sherlock,"Considering that I'm more of a younger audience, I LOVED these episodes! They're hilarious, interesting, and most importantly, make you want more. After the cliffhanger in the Great Game, I got so mad at the director's for ending it like that. I wanted to know what happened, no scratch that, I neeeded to know what happened. When you want to know what happens THAT badly, you can tell it's probably a good show. I think this ""modern"" version of Sherlock Holmes is better just because more people can relate to it. I saw a couple episodes of the ""older"" Sherlock Holmes and I just didn't understand it very well, it was to victorian. But this one was way easier to relate to. I especially love it when Sherlock makes these insulting jokes about people, it's hilarious! If I had to change one thing about these episodes I would make more of them! Watch it!!"
5,Best Screen Version of Sherlock Holmes Ever,"This series is based off of the classic work Sherlock Holmes series. There are lots of adaptations in the episodes to bring the series into the modern age such as cellphones, cars, bombs, snipers. The series ended with a cliff hanger and should be back sometime in 2012. I can't wait and you won't be able to either. You will watch these episodes one by one and think, ""Brilliant!"""
5,Best new show,"I first watched this series on instant Netflix and immediately fell in love. It's a great, modern twist on an old classic. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is amazing and the chemistry between him and Martin Freeman is just pure magic. Entertaining, thought provoking, humorous, and beautiful on bluray it's a great buy for the whole family!"
5,SHERLOCK that you can believe!,This is a fabulous movie. I can not wait until the next disc comes out. The directing and acting and of course the story is all done so well. I love this!!
5,Modern day Sherlock,I just loved seeing a new modern day Sherlock. I have been a fan for 40 yr and it is delightful to see new productions of these classic stories. They did a great job with all the new technologies and Sherlock has quit smoking! I found that little touch hilarious. I can't wait to see Season Two.
5,love this Sherlock,"I love this Sherlock, as I wrote about season two as well. I'm not a fan of use of technology in films, especially when updating Victorian classics, but I feel they've done that wonderfully here. I enjoyed the updated versions of old storylines. Cumberbatch is great as Sherlock! I also really like this Watson."
5,Amazing,Feel bad that I took so long to try this out. This was a fantastic series and definitely worth the investment.
5,Love it!,I love this show. What can I say more than I love this show. I still have 3 more words. Done. : )
3,good show but not at this price.,Been watching this on SD on PBS good show i would but it in HD if the price per show wasn't so insane. 7 bucks a episode is a bit over the top.
2,"Acting Good, Plots Stupid","I watched this on the recommendation of a friend.The acting is splendid. So is the dialogue. Witty, quick, crisp, unpredictable, funny.The characters are interesting, up to a point. Sherlock's computeresque rationality gets a little tiring.The photography is also beautiful, which makes the series watchable.But the plots are little short of idiotic.First, serial killers, or killer. Dull, dull, dull, and pointless.Second, needless convolutions in the service of--convolutions.When the third (and last) of the set was done, I could not remember a single one; and I was glad."
5,Oh boy.,I've been in love with this series since my friend first showed it to me. Being able to find both seasons for this cheap was awesome!
5,Smashing!,Really love this series every episode has been solid and entertaining and fun! What more can anyone ask for in a show!
4,So much more watchable,"than the one on CBS right now. It's a story like a story should be. It has its own character's idiosyncracies, flavors, and pace. You know you'll have to watch each episode again not because its that good, but because you want to soak up everything again and rediscover anything you've missed. It doesn't come in its own pre-packaged box. It comes on a big ole trash can lid for you to rummage through to delight in whatever you want, whenever you want."
4,Sherlock not a shock!,"This rendition of Sherlock Holmes based off of the books, stands to be just as good or even better than the old series of Sherlock Holmes. 'Sherlock' has an allure, intrigue, the weird, deduction, and obviously the unique friendship between Dr. Watson, and Sherlock Holmes. The actors are really befitting of the roles they play, and definitely draw you in with the uniqueness. Sherlock is creepy smart, has near perfect memory and is more observant than a watch dog. Watson, is slow, but loyal, curious and courageous and warm. I have to also say, that this series is never boring. This is a most definite watch!"
4,Sherlock modernized,"I found the stories both interesting and well put together. What they have done is made the setting in modern London but used much of the old story and characters.The dialogue is good; I am sure whether most of it comes out of the book or whether the writers wrote in into the story, but some of it is very good. I particularly like some of the quotes. They are very clever.The characters are interesting. I, particularly like Watson, who character is not the stuff shirt so often portrayed. I think his acting is very good.It is worth seeing."
4,"Better than episode 2, not as good as episode 1. Love Moriarty!","Better than episode 2, not as good as episode 1. Love Moriarty! How perfectly unhinged he is. Instead of being a caracature of a mad archnemesis, he seems a believable sociopath."
5,Great modern adaptation of the classic detective,Sherlock is a truly brilliant and fun show. I enjoyed how intelligent the writing was and the duo of Cumberbatch and Freeman is too good to pass up. A must see for mystery lovers!
5,21st Century Sherlock,"I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since high school days in the 60's. I've read all of the Conan Doyle novels and short stories at least five times, maybe more. To be honest, I didn't believe this modern day Sherlock would work but it does - better than I ever could have hoped. The characters, and the stories paralel the originals with just enough twist to make for great entertainment. Better still, there is an element of humor that is missing in the original stories that makes watching all the more fun. I would recommend the videos to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. Can't wait for season two!"
5,A wonderful adaptation,"I have been a Sherlock & Watson fan for many, many moons now and I like them all...mostly. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, Sir Ben Kingsley and Sir Michael Caine(one of the very funny ones), Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, even Hugh Laurie and Robert Sean Leonard. All of them well done in my opinion.This version is set in modern day London and I am thrilled to see the source material alive and well in this series. As of this writing I have only seen the first three but I have signed up for the season pass and am looking forward to many more episodes with these two new Holmes and Watson.Watch it for yourself and make up your own minds."
5,In invitation...,"Do you like a challenge? Here's one for you:15 minutes.That's all I need to convince you to watch this show.Start with Episode One: A Study in Pink and watch for 15 minutes.You will not be disappointed. If you want to stop watching after 15 minutes, go ahead. Walk away. Please respond to my comment and tell me why the first 15 minutes did NOT intrigue you, seduce you and otherwise convince you to keep watching.I know they will.So go...watch it. You will not regret it."
3,"GOOD, NOT GREAT.","This series with a modernized Sherlock Holmes takes a little getting used to. The first episode introducing Holmes and Watson is very good. The second episode is an uninteresting and confusing mess. The last episode which introduces us to Moriarty is fairly confusing but leads to a suspenseful and exciting cliffhanger ending. The acting is very good and like many of these British series the production values are excellent.As stated, this series is good but it will never make one forget Jeremy Brett, the greatest Sherlock Holmes of all time."
3,wrong standard,"This message was also submitted as a part of my review of the newly received book ""Get things done"" but I will repeat it here as well.As written previously the received Sherlock DVD was not standarized for Europe, and thereforeplayable in the U.S and Canada region only. Do you have any suggestions here?Best;Odd Johan Overye"
3,21st Century Sherlock,The BBC builds an impressive track record of movie achievements by taking a known story and contextualising in a different time or place. Examples include Wallander ( Swedish detective series with an English spoken dialogue) the Shakespeare retold series ( 4 key plays are conceived in today's settings) and now Sherlock stays true to Conan Doyle's formulation inclusive of 221B Baker Street and arch enemy Moriarty but in the setting of contemporary London. This initial series comprises 3 episodes each of 90 minutes. The lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch plays Sherlock but could be mistaken as Dr. Who. The series is jolly good fun and the conclusion leaves the viewer wanting.
4,I liked it.,"I enjoy the new Sherlock Holmes. The dialogue was bit hard to hear completely since the actor seemed to mumble somewhat. Pretty far out, but enjoyable none the less. Hope they keep on trying. It's a great idea."
5,Surprised and pleased,"I had reservations about a modern Sherlock Holmes but after purchasing and watching the first episode, I was really into it. The players were excellent and the plot very entertaining. I would suggest all Sherlock fans to see this adaptation."
1,Extremely Arrogant and Quite Implausible -,"The first episode was moderately good, despite the over-emphasis on Sherlock Holmes' arrogance. The next two were total losses - Holmes' personal repugnance was overpowering, and the plots were extremely implausible."
1,Just Watch Jeremy Brett,"Yegods, how awful. If you want to see Holmes well done, jut watch the Granada series with Jeremy Brett."
1,Disappointed,"Well, I have to say, I didn't like this. I am a HUGE fan of the original books and the new movie, but for me, one of the things that made it so special for me was that Holmes and Watson could do the extraordinary things that they did WITHOUT the help of laptops or cellphones or other gadgets. So this really disappointed me."
2,not sure why they made Sherlock gay,"I would have thought Dr. Watson more gay than Sherlock. Watson liked to tag along with some eccentric character, not the other way around. Just seems like a very imprudent plot development for the year 2010."
5,Excellent,"I have been a Holmes afficionado for many years. To say I doubted these stories relating to the 21st century would be an understatement. How wrong I was. The programming is superb. Shame they only make three to a series, but I suppose the quality is worth it."
5,Great Refreshing take on Holmes,"Great, true to the original this is it. original but totally updated. the acting is first class. Dr. Watson is fabulous. A must see.If you like Great TV this is it."
5,should you watch this?,"it's elementary, my dear reader.i'm a huge fan of the old arthur conan doyle stories so i was dubious when i heard sherlock was being ""modernized."" but the series works extraordinarily well. after watching the three 90 minute episodes, i feel as if benedict cumberbatch IS sherlock holmes. he is phenomenal in the role, and so is martin freeman. the setting might be modern, but the clever dialogue, the intrigue, the sense of adventure, sherlock's prickliness and john's eternal patience shine brightly. and the score is amazing as well. i'd love a soundtrack, hint, hint.there is only one negative about this series, and that's the fact there won't be new episodes for quite some time."
5,Pleasantly surprised.,"I have been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories since I was able to read them. I have always thrilled to the way Holmes solved crimes using the ""powers of his mind"". I was quite ready to dislike this modern re-make of one of my childhhod heros, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main characteristics I loved are still there Holmes, Watson, murders, London, 221B Bakes Street they are just given a modern day location.The action was fast paced the re-telling of the story was really good. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were wonderful as Holmes and Watson. All in all I think anyone who is a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes will not be disappointed in this new re-telling. I highly reccomend it."
5,Sherlock Holmes fans will love these!,"I bought the Sherlock Holmes Season One 2 disc set for my husband for Christmas. He is a MAJOR Sherlock Holmes fan and has the whole Jeremy Brett set by Granada. I wasn't sure that he would even like this version of Sherlock in the 21st Century, but he LOVES it!He has watched the three epidsodes over and over and over again. So often that I can't sit and watch them any more with him. He loves this 21st Century version as much as all of the others and is anxiously awaiting Season Two."
4,Sherlock Holmes A New Slueth For The 21st Century,"This entertaining dvd contains three episodes:1. A Study In Pink - a dead woman wearing pink is found and Sherlock Holmes solves the mystery.2. The Blind Banker - a banker is murdered and Holmes gets the killer.3. The Great Game - various murders take place and yet again, Holmes solves the mystery.Admittingly, this took a little getting used to since I have seen so many of the Basil Rathbone movies. The new actors are entertaining, though, and I did enjoy the three episodes.Will be interesting to see if another season will be produced.In the meantime, watch and enjoy the newest edition of Sherlock Holmes.Recommended."
2,"5 stars for the show, 2 for the price","$24.99 for a mere 3 episodes is ridiculous. One could argue that with the length that it's equivalent to 6 episodes of a normal TV show, but that's still a ridiculous price.Shame, because it's a great show and well worth watching. Wish I had recorded it 'live' when I had the chance. Course, I can also watch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime any time I want and I don't have to pay the exorbitant price for it.Correction - I can get it from Netflix but not yet Amazon Prime. Gotta work on that Amazon - your selection of titles on Prime is still pathetic and you've got new competition with WalMart in the game."
3,The game is not quite afoot.,"Disagreeing with most other reviewers, I watched the first episode and was disappointed. The title, ""A Study in Pink"", should have prepared me, a weak attempt at pseudo-originality that ultimately mocked Doyle's original. Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes, being a combination of Bart Simpson and Keith Olbermann, fell short of the mark. Having gained respect for the British talent at creating quality mysteries, I expected better. A star was added for Watson. Martin Freeman's portrayal of the good doctor shined and will bring me back for the other episodes. This is the Watson Doyle created. It will take all the Afghan veteran's skills to make this dog bark."
1,Only 3 Episodes,"Great Series , however there's only three episodes each season, hardly worth the price its selling for.Save your money or buy used"
1,Disappointed,"We have long been fans of BBC mysteries and the new Sherlock Series proved quite disappointing and did not hold our interest. We felt the series poorly done. The last of the series seemed very disjointed. Where are the great BBC series like Morse, Waking the Dead, (although we have ordered this continuing series from BBC UK) Wallander is excellent and we love the light mysteries too, like Pie in the Sky. I would rather the BBC (if they are trying to save money) produce fewer mysteries of better quality."
3,Not so great,"This third episode in season one is the most bloody and grueling to watch. I kept fast forwarding, hoping to get to a place where there weren't crying people with bombs strapped to them. I finally gave up. The series is unevenly written, and I suppose they are trying to find their way. Benedict Cumberbatch is a brilliant and mesmerizing Sherlock, and when he's on screen, I can't take my eyes off him. Dr. Watson is a complete bore and seems completely unnecessary to the show. He has no character, charm, charisma or even personality. I hope season two is better."
3,Almost escellent,I loved the show and was happy to get the video. Unfortunately it had to skip damaged sections every once in a while.
5,Season One GREAT! Season two? Not so much,"Season One of Sherlock was nothing short of brilliant. Everything about it is so ""right."" Now that I have seen the first full 90 minute story of season two however I have to say that the series has fallen under the spell of the Robert Downey movies. The pace was brisk in season one. Now it's breakneck. Far too many quick cuts are happening now and when Cumberbatch makes a deduction he now speaks so fast you literally can not understand what he is saying. He didn't do that in season one. Really a shame because there is still enjoyment to be had in Season two, it's just that now it's chasing the movies instead of just being it's own wonderful self."
5,Best Sherlock Holmes,"We love the BBC version of Sherlock but wish it had subtitles as the Brits have a ""funny"" accent! Americans speak the correct english - NOT the King's English!!"
5,"Great, just Great","What chemistry, what characters, Cumberbatch is absolutely marvelous as our beloved of Baker St. A great modern adaptation of the classic stories."
5,Sherlock,This is one of the best series. Absolutely loved it. I got one for my mother for Christmas. I know she will love it.
5,Must Watch,"Above excellent in suspense, intrigue and cleverness. Well done as usual by BBC. Good gift for all those people you want to impress with your ""good taste""."
5,Sherlock,"Where has this been all my life?? Oh, this is a great TV show!! The chemistry between Benedict and Martin is perfect!! I couldn't have asked for a better series to come out right now! Just the way this show was brought together and portrayed is awesome. The creators and writers are great Sherlock Holmes fans themselves so they know what they are doing. I loved this series so much, I have Season One and Season Two. If you are looking for a great series with characters with depth and chemistry then this would be a series for you!"
4,Remarkable!,"We (the family) loved this movie. What I liked about it was that Dr. Watson was not a pushover, he really was a strong character, unlike many portrayals. I like the fact that this is set in the modern day with even more intriguing potential in other episodes."
4,great,works like they say great product for the money. could even be disposable after several uses cheap enough to stock up on
4,Nice cutting board set!,"This set is a great value. It's nice to have several on hand so cross-contamination in the kitchen isn't a worry. On the negative side, they do wear out with frequent use. However, given the cost, replacing them is fairly painless, so overall I think it's a good deal."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I purchased these based on the good reviews, but after using them it was what I was worried about. Too flimsy to be considered a cutting board.The flimsiness of these boards just doesn't cut it enough for me. I'm going with the smaller cutting board that has a hole for your hand, it stays rigid and easier to take the sink and clean. Its haphazard to clean these flexible cutting boards, even if you do a lot of chopping all you have to do with a stiff board is rake your scrappings off and clean it in the sink. Cleaning the flexible boards, they'll bend and youre not sure youre cleaning its clean, you have to place it up against something to properly clean it. Everybody has their own likes, this one is not for me."
3,Not very good,* Below review has been given by my wife *I got the set of 5 cutting Boards from Amazon. I found the cutting board very thin and flimsy. But they are long enough to cut vegetables and fruits.
2,Funny Smell,"These Chinese made cutting boards have an extremely strong poisonous chemical smell, like bleach and plastic. I washed them off as the package recommends but the smell remains. I've been hesitant to let food touch these things. Going to give them a few more washes and if the smell doesn't go away I'll return them. If the smell does go away I'll update this review."
3,Not that resistant,I bought these thinking they would be as hardy as the mats from siliconezone. They're flexible and can be used to cut anything but they get scratched easily with a knife. We don't think they'll last that long.
3,Well,Well only ordered these cause they were cheap and colorful...Sorry to say have not use yet..But one day .. We will though
5,I Love These,"I've used these great cutting sheets for years and LOVE them!! They're great cutting boards that take very little space to store... Easy to clean, I love them even more for use in the freezer. I make my own sausage and put out the patties on these sheets to quick freeze. They bend readily to sueeze onto narrow shelves. What did I ever do before I discovered them?!!"
1,save your money,"nice colors but scratch and cut when knife is used on then,forget cleavers as they will shatter"
2,"Flexible, sort of","I thought these would be much more flexible than they are. We do use them regularly, but they are not nearly so pliable as just picking up and easily curling them to create a funnel for your food. They have a tendancy to snap back, and I wouldn't dare store them rubber-banded up as they would never go flat again. Indeed, our biggest complaint with these is that they just require too much effort to bend one way or another - be it rolled up for moving items to the pan or flat on the counter for chopping.And don't even think about putting them in the dishwasher, even on the gentle cycle, regardless of what the description says! They get even more brittle in the dishwasher and lose what little flexibility they have.At the end of the day, I wouldn't buy them again."
1,Horrible cutting boards,"I bought these hoping to have a dishwasher-safe, easy-to-store cutting board for small jobs. However, on my formica counter-tops, these things slide around so much that they are completely unusable. Luckily I didn't waste too much money on them.There are alternate cutting mats like these which have a little silicone on the back side which prevents slippage. Those are much better."
3,Better than nothing,"Be aware that these are pretty thin and flimsy. You really shouldn't be surprised by that given they are quite inexpensive.I bought these to replace one that got too close to a gas stove and melted a bit. That one was 2-3 times as thick and was about had about perfect flex - if you tried to roll it up, it would probably not be about to reach end-to-end (longways). These are so flexible that they can be rolled 1.5x over.Why does that matter? It makes it harder to clean. One hand holding the board, and the other trying to wash it...it just flexes out of the way of the sponge.Still, I really like using cutting boards in general. I'll eventually look for some better ones but they're workable for now."
2,Curls like crazy!,"Product arrived in record time. Great product in concept but not so good in execution. NIce weight, heavier than you normally find in stores but ... the sheets curl badly after the first use. Probably a function of being manufactured in large rolls, then cut to size. I'll continue to use them for a while but eventually replace them with flatter product. Too bad!"
3,Cutting board,Flexible but thin. To avoid sliding around the countertop requires wetting either the boardor countertop.
3,"Great for price, but cheap looking/using.","I purchased these as a gift over Xmas for my b/f who only owned 1 cutting board. We use these alot, however, they are a bit cheap looking and cheaper use than some more expensive cutting boards. They work great & are easy to use & clean-up. Cuts do show up in the plastic; they work good for now, are great for the price, but are short-term and will need to be replaced. If we get engaged I will definitely request a better set for a marriage gift!"
5,"Cheap, Durable, Firm yet Flexible","These cutting boards aren't as flexible as most, but I like them a lot better. They're thick and don't feel like they'll melt if placed in the dishwasher. Awesome product."
2,"Good concept, but ......","I like the idea of having dedicated cutting boards for each type of food, but these are too big for me personally. Also, they use extreme adhesive to put their wrapper on the package - be prepared to use heavy duty adhesive remover, or plan on throwing one of them out (yes, it's that bad)."
4,They do their job,"Great value, comes with many boards color coded to limit confusion. I love that they fold to make for easy pouring into pots and pans."
2,Eh,"The colors are bright and bold, kinda sheer and really thin. I won't be buying them again. The quality of the boards is questionable because it marks super easy. The plastic used is too soft, I feel as if plastic fillaments will end up in the food or something."
2,too thin for heavy cutting,"These are a good size, have reasonable flexibility, but I think that they are simply too thin for serious cutting. Almost any slice laves a rather deep gouge in the surface. I have almost felt that my knife was going to cut all the way through the mat. OK for some kitchen uses, but I would recommend something thicker and tougher as a real cutting surface."
3,Functional but flimsy,"I think the term ""cutting board"" is a little misleading. ""Cutting mats"" would be a more accurate name for them. I was disappointed about how thin and flimsy these mats are. I've used one of them approximately four times and it has cuts that go all the way through the mat. Its only been used to cut vegetables with a santuko knife. I'm just glad I didn't pay more for them."
3,Not bad. Not great. Three stars,"They are what they are. Considering the packaging makes the suggestion that each color is for a particular use, I would have expected/appreciated some kind of marking on the pieces themselves to reinforce that. They are flexible, they are sufficient size... they're fine. Just nothing to get excited about."
3,eh...,"I think that these cutting mats are just alright. They are no more that just colored pieces of plastic and are totally no frills. I guess it serves it's purpose, but I wouldn't exactly buy again."
1,"Poor quality, not as described","The only good thing about these is the price. They are NOT silicone. They are not flexible or machine washable. It was not worth the cost to return them, but they are lousy. Do not buy unless you want something cheap for one-time use."
3,"Be careful, thickness is for all 5","I was hoping when we ordered these that the thickness specified was for each cutting board, so that they would be nice and thick like the flexible cutting boards sold at your favorite Scandinavian furniture store, but in fact 0.2"" is for all 5 put together. It would be nice if they had listed the thickness of the individual cutting boards for clarity.On the other hand the smooth surface is much easier to dry when hand washing."
3,"Ok, for the price","I wanted to have separate cutting boards for meats and vegetables. So I bought this item. But when I used it to cut meat with bones, the sheets were getting deep marks of the knife. I think that they may serve as use and throw but not for long term. They are ok for vegetables but still leave the scars of the knife."
3,Mostly a joke,"I like the colors but these boards are kind of a joke. They are ultra thin, curl like a Pringles potato chip, and SLIP while you try to cut (can we say dangerous - at least to the content on top of the board - if not to the person doing the cutting). Disappointed best sums up my reaction."
4,2nd time buyer,"they dont last forever but they're easy to store, easy to clean and we use them every single day so having multiples is great and i love the colors"
3,Cutting matts,"I enjoy the cheerful colors. I intended to use these as kitchen cutting mats. Due to the thinness I chose to use them as craft mats. If I knew how thin they would be I would not have purchsed them. Flexible yes, so are other mats I have purchased they are thicker and protect your surface and knife edge. These do not."
3,"Its okay, I would pass next time","Its ok. I knew what I was getting into, but didn't realizing how easy it is prone to scratches!Also, I can't put it in the dishwasher. Some of the plastic coating comes loose. Its also slippery on the counter so I have to be careful cutting veggies."
5,Love the colors,I love being able to have color when preparing food. These are much more fun than the standard white cutting surfaces.
3,easy to use,"LIKES: The multiple colorerd boards - makes it easy to get everything prepped and not have to clean a cutting board inbetween. It's also more sanitary as you only use green for veggies, red for meats, etc. so you don't have cross-contamination.The flexibility - easy to roll and food slides easily into containers.The price.DISLIKES: After one week's use, I see knife marks. Makes me wonder how long these willl last."
2,Damaged too easily,If it was thicker..........maybe it would rate a higher rating. It damages really too easily when cutting.
5,A treasure trove for Wholligans,"This collection of lost & found episodes is a real interactive, multimedia scrapbook. It allows you to take a glimpse to the early era of the series and the clips and 8mm shorts let you form an idea of the adventures that we'll never ever watch."
5,WOW!!!,"Cant wait for this set! Who was the idiot at the BBC that destroyed most of the early Doctor Who's?! The BBC should of known that VCR's was coming,and that some day a format called DVD was going to take the VCR's place in the home.I so much would love to have all the old Doctor Who story's on DVD?! I always wanted to see The Fury from the Deep story,I read the Target book and loved it.I have some of the audio Cd's but it's not the same as watching it.This set will be nice.Cant wait to see The Daleks Master Plan part 2. I hope The first Dalek story will be coming out on DVD soon? It's sad they will not be in the new series.Update the Daleks will be in the new series."
2,Disappointing Patchwork,I was somewhat disappointed by this patchwork as it has no complete story at all. While the Moonbase and the Crusade offer Audio for the missing episodes there is no commentary so you are left to wonder what is happening in the silences.I expected more from the BBCThe episodes that are shown are captivating and do give an insight into the quality and occasional lack of quality that makes up Doctor Who.The Underwater Menace with its string transported Fish People and exaggerated evil madman was quite amusing.Yes the Show was great what a shame the DVD production is not.
3,Early Doctor,This was interesting in that you get to see the early Doctor. However I didn't know that some of the episodes weren't complete and all you hear is the audio because the film has been lost to time. It would be nice if there was some kind of warning to the consumer about what they were really getting.
1,Lost faith in Seth Godin as a marketing guru after this book,GODIN wrote about the new way of customer and prospect communication in PERMISSION MARKETING -- a must read. He then got bold and told us about differentiation by creating something completely out-of-the-ordinary such as a PURPLE COW -- agreeable airplane literature. Now there's really nothing else to talk about and he tries to push the envelope talking about how Cracker Jack's prize is the product.Your product's soul is not only about the extras.I would have preferred he kept to his excellent job in PERMISSION MARKETING and not losing his focus as he did in FREE PRIZE INSIDE.I am not going to read a 4th GODIN book.
3,Interesting reading - but nothing very new,"The book is not exactly what it promises: To show the next big marketing idea. It is not standing out, besides its innovative cover. The contents - nothin' what you haven't read elsewhere.Are the tips applicable? Seth says that everybody could do some soft innovation, go to the Edges, create Edgecraft - So yeah, there is a thing or two that sound interesting, or is applicable. May be it is enough for some, but surely not for everyone.Okay may be I am unfair - there are a couple of things that are interesting - a lot of examples in the end. Some good ideas here and there. But as a breakthru ideas? Nope.As such, it is good reading, just for fun plus some light learning.If you really want to learn a thing or two from Seth? Read his blog. It is good - most of the time if he is not just promoting one of his books. Here, you find great ideas, and challenging thoughts.Or log on to my blog: http://alwayswow.blogspot.com"
4,I recommend all of Seth Godin's books for business and marketing,I recommend all of Seth Godin's books for business and marketing. Always something new to learn and add to your business. Very simple and practical. This is a solid book.
3,Champion of innovation,"The book is well written, however as in many business books the Free Prize Inside could have been an article in a business publication rather than a book. The premise of the book is to develope your ideas and get others in the organization to take ownership and champion your cause. This could have been abbreviated to five pages."
3,Live album from Brazilian rock icon,"Ney Matogrosso ""Ao Vivo""This is a reissue of a 1989 concert album from Brazilian rock-pop star Ney Matogrosso, whose career spans back to the early 1970s. This was originally released on the CBS label. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
3,Is It Convection or Not?,"I purchased a Krups FBC2 toaster oven as a gift last Christmas. The person I gave it to, loves it! And it is indeed, a convection oven. Now I want to buy one for myself but I am confused. I see that Amazon.com offers the FBC1 toaster oven at a cheaper price. The Amazon Product Description states and I quote... ""Its convection heat, which is ideal for longer baking times, circulates heated air around the food for faster, more even cooking results."" I went to the Krups website and I can't find anything that states the FBC1 is a convention oven. Maybe an owner of the FBC1 could write in and clear this up. Is FBC1 toaster oven convention or not? Thank you."
2,Too much money for it to break on you,"My husband bought this product becuase he thought Krups was a good name. He spent lots of money on it thinking it would last. Wrong! The springs broke on the door and it wouldn't stay shut, then it just stopped working. A lot of money for a piece of crap!"
3,"Damn, this thing is huge.",You should know before you order this item that it is as large as a small microwave oven. Check the measurements carefully (which I stupidly failed to do). Not recommended if you value your counter space.
3,Oven is good but toaster is not,Not much more to say. We have had this for 6 months and find the oven to be good but the toaster takes too long to make toast and only one side is toasted.
4,Nice toaster oven,"This is a nice toaster oven - it is roomy inside, the controls are easy to learn and use, and it heats evenly. It takes longer to toast bread than I would like, but overall it is nicer than other toaster ovens I have used. The instruction manual says to turn on the oven for 15 minutes to burn off any residue (the smell people complain about) before cooking any food. I did this, and had no subsequent problems with chemical odors."
4,who helped the slaves?,"This is a kids biography of Harriet Tubman. We learn a lot about her in this book. She helps lots of slaves escape slavery with the Underground Railroad. She always stood up for what she thought was right. She had a lot of courage. She knew that if she ever got caught she would be beaten but she continued to help others.The book was not too long and not too short. It contained the right amount of information for kids.I would recommend this book to kids who are learning about the black history, slaves or the Civil War. I learned a lot from reading this book."
5,Great mirror at a great price!,I have been very happy with the quality of this mirror. It looks great and more expensive than its actual cost.
5,Great Quality for the price,This mirror is beautiful. It is easy to hang (make sure your use anchors as it is heavy). The mirror is very good quality and it looks like I paid much more for it than I did. I would highly recommend it.
2,My review of this product,"This product was good back in the day, but now with all these things available online for free and much better, this product IMO is obsolete."
1,you have to carry CD with you,"You cannot install CD on computer, you have to open it each time you need it. Plus I had trouble installing .exe file for unknown reasons. I expected better product."
4,Yes,Great movie and a wonderful ending. Now I must continue to type to get in all required words. done done
3,Not my kind of cards,"I found the card designs too busy, but my style is more along the lines of Simple Scrapbooks. These cards take longer to make than advertised and a lot of the designs only seem to work with specific patterned paper and lots of fancy/expensive embellishments. I am more simplistic and minimalistic, but this book would probably be great for people with different styles."
5,Awesome product,"This is the first thing that has given me relief from the hormone changes I have been going through for over a year, biggest problem was NO SLEEP and anxiety making it almost impossible to have a life. However I found you have to give it the time to work, it took about 2 wks to start getting some consistent relief from the anxiety and lack of sleep and after 5-8 weeks life was good again. I did start by taking one regular Remifemin in the morning and a Good Night Remifemin before bed for the first 3-4 weeks but then just P.M. version after that. When I have alot of stress I still take the two doses that helps keep me calmer ( I also use Progest cream). Finally I have my life back again!"
4,need to take 3x's a day for greatest benefit,"After about 5 days of being on the 2x/day dosage, I started feeling relief from my hot flashes. I do, however, use this in conjunction with a natural, wild yam, OTC cream that may be working synergistically together to accomplish relief. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks, the hot flashes started creeping back. I've upped my dosage to 3x/day now based on the advice of a friend who's pharmacist told her to take it this way. I have returned to the relief that I had previously experienced now. I have the feeling, however, that our bodies grow accustomed to the supplements and that is why they lose effectiveness over time. If this begins to happen again, I will switch back to Estroven or some other natural product....anything to keep the hot flashes under control. The resulting stress from lack of sleep when the flashes occur all night long is a double whammy!"
5,FINALLY,"I can't say enough good things about this product....I ordered it along with the ""daytime"" if you will, remifemin and I have not had more than 2 night time sweats since it kicked in. It took only about a week for me to see the difference. I use one of these at night (since they are a little more expensive than the ""plain"" remifemin) and then one of the white one for days. I cannot be any happier! I will re-order soon!"
1,Disappointment,"I tried this product for 4 months. For the first two months I took it as directed (one tablet in the morning, one tablet at night.) I had NO reduction in hot flashes. Then I took double the dosage. Again, absolutely no reduction in my hot flashes. I even kept notes on the number of my hot flashes. I'm very disappointed in this product. I have done some research and found that the latest studies reveal that using a placebo (sugar pill) and using this product help women equally well...meaning, of course, that the placebo effect is what is helping women, not the black cohosh supplement. What a waste of money and my time! I had really wanted this product to help me."
1,So far not so good,"I'm about halfway thru this box and my symptoms have not improved, matter of fact they are worse. The box does say it can take up to 12 weeks, which means I will have to order another box, more money, no relief."
5,Menopouse Help,I have been in my perimenopuse since I was 40 and when I heard about this product about 5 years ago I decided to use it and still using it since.It works wonderfull with the hotflashes and the insomnia.The best thing is that is natural and after all this years I haven't had any secondary effects.I recommend it a 100%.
3,seems helpful,"After my hysterectomy, I started taking regular Remifemin during the day, but was still not sleeping much, so I added Remifemin Good Night. In addition to the Good Night product, I take a standard dose of 3 mg. melatonin. In combination, these seem to help. I have been taking this for about a month. I will continue to see if there is ongoing improvement. I do feel good that I am NOT taking HRT and I do not plan to! (boooooo, HRT) I find it best to take this about an hour before bedtime. Amazon was the cheapest I found for this. WalMart is cheapest for the regular Remifemin ($11)but my WalMart doesn't carry the Good Night stuff."
4,Exceptional Product,"I hesitantly ordered this, as I find most OTC pills don't work as advertised/reviews are fake. However, after 2 days, I no longer woke up in a pool of sweat. Additionally, my moods seemed to even out. I am peri-menopausal so my hormone levels are too crazy. This could be just a plecebo effect, but I will continue to take these as there is a very noticeable change. I am finally getting a good nights sleep and not having to change the sheets every two days."
2,Be careful,"I bought this on recommendation from my Gynecologist. This is supposed to help with menopausal symptoms without adding estrogen into your system. For me, it helped the hot flashes a little HOWEVER it increased my mood swings. Before taking, I just had to deal with hot flashes and had relatively little mood swing activity. When I took this product, my mood swings were ridicilous - stopped taking as soon as I became aware and feel much better now. If you are already having mood swings - this product MIGHT help. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Estrogenic effects, cancer risk","OK if you have no cancer risk, but you shouldn't use if you or family has cancer history, especially estrogen receptor positive cancer. No products with black cohosh."
5,No longer works for me.,I have been using Remifemin Good Night for about 9 months now. I found that it took me about 5-6 weeks before I saw a noticable difference in my sleep patterns. What I like about it is that I can get a GOOD 6-8 hours sleep using this product and not wake up groggy the next morning. Update: Remifemin is no longer working for me. It's been about 2 years since starting it. I've noticed that it does relieve the night sweats but at the expense of dehydration. I wake 3-4 times a note having to use the bathroom. So I'm back to not sleeping.
5,excellent!,"these really help to get rid of my hot flashes; in the beginning, i only took one a day, then read the packaging - now they work perfectly!"
4,Remifemin works as a gift,I bought this for a friend and she says after years of night sweats she is getting relief. Thanks much.
5,Relief at Last,Read all the great reviews and decided to try it. For me it change my life in three days. Hot flashes are gone and nightmares and crazy dreams as well. Thanks so much for all the people who took the time to write reviews. I am so happy with this product I am writing my first ever review. If you are as miserable as I was you have nothing to lose. Other black cohosh products did NOT do what this did for me. The price is great. I tell all my friends about this product. Hope this helps.
5,Great Support,"If you are looking for something that is going to help you with the likes of hormones, then you have come to a great product. This therapeutic drug helps in a number of ways, such as helping you sleep and using several healthy ingredients. It effects are similar to that ofMenopause Support- 3 Bottles/ 1 Month Supply. All-Natural Herbal Remedy for the Relief of Hot Flashes and Other Menopause Symptoms, and for that reason, Remifemin is a great product to have for any support. I highly recommend trying it."
3,Didn't notice a difference,"Well, I had high hopes for for this product, but after I realized that I took the ""Good Night"" version in the morning by mistake and was going strong, I realized there might be no reason to spend the extra $$'s. I like Remifemin for hot flash control, but don't plan on spending the extra dollars to purchase the Good Night version again."
1,not working,I've been taking remifemin for 1 month now and I have noticed no differences at all with the hot flashes or other horrible symptoms related to menopause. I have 1 month worth of this product left and I will continue to use it because I know sometimes it may take some time for supplements to start working.
4,Hot Flash remedy,"I recently purchased Remifemin on the recommendation of my OB-GYN. I haven't noticed a big difference in the frequency of my hot flashes, however the box does say it may take as long as 12 weeks, so I am still hopeful.Amazon came through as always. Fast and efficient. Big fan of Amazon and their customer service."
3,Hoping for Relief,"Can't tell if this product gives a placebo effect or the real deal, but it seems to alleviate the severity of hot flashes...not eliminate. Now Black Cohosh has been given a possible link to cancer. Not much published, but check it out online. Kaiser Permanente made note of it in a recent newsletter. So I'll probably quit taking it after I finish this box. I've already been hit with uterine cancer..probably from hormone use (natural estrogen & progesterone) . . so my doctor will not prescribe these any longer. Nothing works like good ol' estrogen for hot flashes. Good Luck. The product is still worth a try."
3,"worked okay, for a while, but nothing now","Just as with SourceNatural's Hot Flash remedy, Remifemin worked great until halfway through the second box. Now, I'm back to horrible hot flashes. I just can't seem to find the permanent solution. I hope you have better luck!"
1,Still Sweating,Took for relief of Hot Flashes. Took as directed and it had no effect whatsoever. Still searching for some relief. Sorry to say these pills didn't work for my wife who has suffered for years with severe hot flashes. She is presently taking Fish Oil Gels and Healthy Menopause Tonic with little result so far.
2,made me feel fuzzy in the am,"I started taking the product and about a week into taking them I was gettingA foggy feeling in my head like I was drugged and I had a dull headache ,once I stoppedtaking them it went away .Maybe just not good for me I know we all have different reactions to things we take soI am still glad I tried them as I have been desperate to find some relief for my symptomsnow i know remifemin is not for me another product off my list .."
2,NOT for Me,"I am having insomina, waking up repeatedly throughtout the night. Sometimes 5-6x's in an 8 hour night. I bought this because of the GOOD reviews. Well, I am one of the one's it didn't work for. To me it was a waste of money. Bought a different product that seems to be helping more, kinda..which has 80mg of black cohash and other vitamins. Am getting ""some relief"" but not 100% which is a bummer!"
4,Do it yourself!!,If you have a basic knowledge of telephony ane design your own phone cords than this is a must have item. It crimps both size plugs which comes in handy for duel jobs like data cables. great price too.
5,Good,"It works... So far I haven't used it much, but first impression is that it is constructed good. Solid feel to the tool, does not feel flimsy... Time will only tell whether it will hold up, but after a few uses I have high hopes."
4,Paladin Tools 1556 All-in-One Crimper for WE/SS-Style Data & Phone Cable,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
5,Great Book,This book of Mexican's recipes is a great example of the Mexican Food. The repices are easy to make and really good!!. She even recommends places to shop for the ingredients.
3,falls appart to easy,"While the main body of this Naboo fighter is strong. It attena and such, tend to fall off to easily, making it difficult to play with and only good for display puposes. Plus, you get Anakin again, and he's avaliable in so many sets, it gets repetative. Lego needs to produce more generic pilots.However its nice to have a few battle droids to play with, though like most I have yet to figure out what that thing on wheels is.While I think this vehicle is fine for colection purposes, I think fighters like the A-wing are far more durable when it comes to everyday play."
3,wesley's review,"This is a pretty good set, a nice renderition of the N-1 Naboo starfighter. A little short, though. I, as many other people, have no clue as to what that car-like thing is. Maybe it's a maitenance vehicle. Anyway, it's got a couple of battle droids. I now have six. And it comes with ANOTHER anakin. I have one from an error in the landspeeder set, the anakin's podracer set, and, well, this one. It's a pretty good set overall. 8^)"
3,A Little Disappointed,"This is an excellent fighter to add to your Star Wars Lego Collection. However, the Lego set disappoints me a little. The engines attached to the wings aren't very secure and I could see them come off in play quite easily. The TR FED droids are also cheap and don't seem to stand up that well. Lego don't seem to have put much thought into them as they did with the Pit Droids in the Pod Race set. There is a little vehicle which is useless as well. Lego should have put the money used to make this vehicle into making the shield over Anakin's cockpit SLIDE open/close. There are also NO moving parts to be excited about."
1,Listen rather than read,"I bought this from Amazon the other day, too hastily I'm afraid. I wanted something different and, well, this doesn't do it -- not for me, anyway. There's an unyielding blandness and monotony to this CD; I can't listen to more than half of each song. The rhythm guitar work overwhelms, the voice is just talking into the mic, the bass is buried, and the drums sit on top. The melodies were lost on me. I normally don't like to be so critical, but this CD was a huge disappointment. I should have listened closer. Don't make my mistake and listen closely for yourself. The samples here represent the overall CD well, so if you like them, you'll be happy with the whole package."
4,Well Done Melissa - A Great Album,"Being a huge fan of Smashing Pumpkins, I was really happy when I heard Melissa, the Pumpkins bassist during the dying days of Machina, was releasing a solo album. However, with the help (!) of Kerrang and other biased journalists, Melissa's rather great album has been tarnished by a series of bad reviews. But why? I just can't understand it, because Auf Der Maur is brilliant!Every song in the album is well written, with brilliant riffs, good lyrics and true rock n' roll! It reminds me of something (can't quite put my finger on it though) but it's something I like, which is good, I guess.Anyways, this is a fabulous album and I really would encourage anybody who likes Hole, Pumpkins, A Perfect Circle or even Nirvana to check this out. Well done Melissa!"
5,melissa's back to show you how its done,this c.d. is so great. i love it. I felt like for a while there wasn't much going on with rock music but thank god this cd came out. I just love it I cant say enough goo stuff about it. Thank you madm
4,A good mixture of different styles,"Going by the name of the band, you'd suspect 'Auf der Maur' to be a band focused on Melissa Auf der Maur. This is clearly not the case. The parts she plays are not technically outstanding, they're just functional. Together with the band however, they become outstanding songs. Some songs are better than others, but I like to listen to all of them.On the tracks where the Kyuss and QOTSA artists helped, you can clearly hear the influences. There are some definite singles on the record (followed the waves, taste you), and to top things off, a ballad(-like song), called Overpower Thee.All in all, worth the money if you ask me :)"
4,Refreshing,"Melissa Auf der Maur guides us through the dark mysteries of love on her debut album ""Auf der Maur"". The songs have drive, and interesting melodies which are very refreshing. The lyrics are good, but sometimes very obscured. Melissa mixes between rock/pop and hard rock. Her passion for music shines through, and I have great respect for her making an album without having a big company breathing down her neck and telling her what music is supposed to sound like. ""Overpower thee"" should never have been on the album with its simple melody and poor lyrics, but all in all this is a very good debut album from a promising artist. Buy the album, and let the songs grow on you before you decide whether you like it or not :)"
3,hmm,"at first i really loved this album.. but i found that after listening to it for a while, i got really bored of it. it wasnt horrible by all means but.. eh."
5,Glad I gave it a chance...,"This album is amazingly really good, a heck of a lot better than Courtney's album, and I have to add that not only can she jam out on the guitar but she can sing!!! I was a little upset when Hole broke up but I'm glad to see that at least one member of that band can produce a decent solo album. Props to Melissa for an awesome album. I can't wait to hear more from her in the future."
5,Surprisingly Good!,"This album is like a gourmet dinner- very satisfying, with lots of wonderful different flavours (musicians?) to spice things up. And you'll want to hear it again and again because the songs are so catchy and FUN. Sure the lyrics are a little corny (i.e- i'm on a hook yeah, smell that cook) and melissas voice can be paper thin, but it dosen't really matter. She is totally being herself, this album is not pretentious at all. almost every song on the album has the potential to be a single. This is alternative pop rock at its finest....i wish there were more melissas and less avrils!!Also- i got the pleasure of meeting her when she was in town and she is the sweetest musician i ever met..."
5,The Hole Package,"Okay we have been waiting for Melissa to do something since she left hole, joined pumpkins and then disapeared into the night! But finally she is here to kick some ass, especially to everyone who thought she was just courtneys back up singer! She is more than that, this album is by far one of the best from this year and the best from the post-hole members.My faves are Taste you and Real life and if you dont like it then you have something wrong with your ears, and you should have a doctor look at that."
5,Auf Der Maur is outstanding!,"This CD is a must have for any fan of hole/smashing pumpkins.I bought it after hearing ""Followed the Waves"".Followed the Waves is in my opinion the most ""rocking"" song on the CD. The other songs are more melodic and a definate must hear!!!Keep it the music coming !!!"
4,strong effort by ex-Hole bassist,"Better than ""America's Sweetheart""?? No.Very different, but definitely not better.Melissa has made a strong debut album, full of good strong melodies and great sounds.The album is not perfect though.Melissa seems to lack assurance as a lead singer, and her lyrics lack the grit that she should have learned from working with Courtney Love.The production is lavish and lush(not to mention melodramatic), and cushions her fragile voice perfectly, but it isn't exactly attention grabbing.Also, the male vocals on the album are atrocious.So, while Melissa needs to improve on her vocal prowess and lyrical grit, this album is definitely worth listening to.But, I'd also suggest picking up a copy of ""America's Sweetheart"" for something a bit edgier, both sonically and lyrically."
2,"Man, this is bad...","Melissa ADM is certainly talented, but she doesnt come across as anything other than overrated on this bloated, self indulgent, boring shambles of a record. The songwriting is just plain dreadfiul, amateurish stuff. Her singing is pretty bad too. Hopefully, she'll keep playing with other more established musicians, and learn some more. this was a record I bought because I wondered why it stiffed so badly; but after listening to it a few times, it's pretty obvious why no one bought this album - it's really bad."
5,Cool Album,"For a bassist lead singer chick, this is a very cool album. Her lyrics are great. Some people are saying that her lyrics are not good, but hey Kurt Cobain said it best ""lyrics should never be to obvious because if it is to obvious the song will be stale, also lyrics should never be in peoples faces 100% all the time."" It's about time a REAL GIRL that sings better than Avril Lavigne! Melissa rocks just like Gwen Steffani, Shirley Manson, Adrian Brodie, the Donnas, and Courtney Love!"
5,Best Name For A Band,"Any chick that came from a band named Hole must be pretty special! Melissa's cd is wonderful. It's a little on the pop side but then again, a lot of albums nowadays fall under that catergory. Real A Lie and Followed The Waves caught my attention when it started to get played on KROQ here in Los Angeles. I caught a show they did in West Hollywood and she doesn't sound bad at all live! Met the band afterwards and they are some really down to earth musicians. Catchy (and very radio friendly songs) make this a good pick up. The name stands out and best of all, a band that doesn't start with ""the"" in the beginning. Keep rocking M!"
4,Not Bad,former bassist from the hole and smashing pumpkins went solo. i like some catchy tunes on this album. there are a few songs i don't really care for. music is a subjective topic.
3,Unique historical information about the Mugello track...,"This Italian and English language book covers the history of the infamous Mugello track now owned by Ferrari SpA. It includes a number of historical photos from the early days of the track and more recent photos from Ferrari Club Italia's Mugello meet.For some this may be an interesting book, particularly if you are curious about the track's history. It includes a large number of unique photos detailing the track's construction, some interesting bits on the history of racing in the area before the track was created, and the describes the issues involved in the design of the track.Unfortunately, I noticed several errors in the identification of different Ferrari models and therefore I'm not sure that the historical information about the track can be completely trusted. If you are interested in the track's history or are filling in a complete historical Ferrari library I'd recommend purchasing this book, otherwise leave it for another time..."
3,Bottle review,"The bottle Carrier was fine, but the belt needs to be a little longer. Otherwise, it's OK."
4,"Plainly written, thoughtful","Kosinksi's essay on the making of the film ""Reds"" reveals a side of Warren Beatty unfamiliar to the general public. It and the other essays in this book are plainly written but thoughtful and built on a foundation of sensitive observation."
2,Nothing New Here!,"What do you people see in this book?!The book is filled with the standard rules about investing for retirement: invest for the long haul, use compound growth, sell assets when they are high--duh! And all of this is the ""Grangaard Strategy?"" (OK, so the only slightly valuable advice is: plan to live longer than average.) The book is lacking in any real substance and comes across as a pitch to get you to seek further help from a Grangaard financial planner."
5,Great Book! Very helpful concepts.,This book provides very practical guidance that can be implemented by anyone. Paul Grangaard has given me peace of mind that I can in fact manage my assets for my lifetime. His strategies will enable me to capture higher rates of return while minimizing risks. Thank you.
2,Informercial in book form and not much else,Buy this book to see how someone can effectively mount a very good marketing program. But don't expect to find anything other than platitudes when it comes to financial planning. The material is quite elementary.I'm guessing somewhat here but I'll bet that Mr. Grangaard's approach to building his business includes:- Go onto TV and sell his book.- Load the book review input with 5 stars.- Get the book buyers to sign up for Grangaard trained financial planners.- Sell the poor saps that to go these planners Grangaard sponsored products.Don't waste you money or your time on this.
4,The Great Influenza,"It was like taking a course in the history of medical science from Hippocrates to the present. Chapter seven the text helped me to understand the difference between virus and bacteria. In chapter eight improved my understanding to the immune system. The descripition of the 1918-1919 pandemic was very informative, and demonstrates our vulerability in current times.Many references in the book seemed to be repetative, and to me distracted from the lessons to be learned. Overall, the book was very informative, well done, and a clear warning."
4,The Once and Future Pandemic,The influenza epidemic of 1918 took millions of lives worldwide. Barry's book reminds us just how bad it was and discusses the implications for today's worries about avian flu or some other source of a new pandemic. I found the history of U.S. medicine in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century fascinating. I did not realize that the scientific method was just beginning to be used in this country. The foreshadowing of the influenza plague in the early part of the book was a bit overdone. A bit more editing to excise redundancy would have been a good idea.
4,More than just a history,"There are a lot of good reviews describing this book, so I will just say I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was difficult at times to track with the story because it weaves back and forth on itself so that you understand the whole story. Worth reading."
4,Well written and fascinating,"This book is that rare combination of interesting writing and thorough research. Indeed it was hard to put down until I reached the middle of the book, when ironically the discussion of the epidemic itself bogged down. I frankly could have done with just a tad less drama (...it was, after all, just the flu). You get the irony of that statement if you've read the book. But really, isn't this tragedy enough drama in itself?One of the aspects that I quite enjoyed in this book was the in-depth history of American medical education and educators. I also liked learning about the people who were researching desperately trying to find answers.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am glad I spent both the money and the time."
4,Really enjoyed it. Timely.,"As a physician, I enjoyed the story of the transformation of American medicine. Definitely was enlightening in that respect. I read the criticism that the book tended to jump around. It did somewhat, but it did so with a purpose following the various lines of attack from the researchers involved or from a geographical perspective of the disease. I don't think you could have written it differently and understood the process of its spread and the attempt to conquer it."
2,Would have loved less medicine and more life,"If your a doctor, this book would probably be extremely interesting. I wanted something more about how the Great Influenza changed lives. This book dealt a lot with research, medicine, disease, scientists, etc."
3,Great Read for a Medical Doctor,Probably a great read for a doctor interested in medical history. The Great Influenza is heavy on the medical terminology and uses much repetition.
1,Wish I Were Sick,"If I were sick, it would be an explanation as to why I bought this piece of crap!If I had wanted a history lesson on all of the doctors of the 15th century through today, I'd have looked for one to buy. This is a boring and complicated read about early times in medicine period.I'm over 1/4 way through this horrible book and have not even gotten to any flu issues yet. This is so boring, that I've resulted to speed reading just to get through it. What a waste of money! If I could have given it 1/2 star or none, I'd have done so.DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLU EPIDEMIC OF 1917."
1,A Bird Named Enza,"The one thing that is false in this book even though it claims to have a lot of facts, is that it says the influenza caused panic among the citizens. In fact, it didn't cause ""panic."" If you can imagine that in 1918 there was little communication between cities and people were dying but other cities didn't even know about it until months later.If you were to read A Bird Named Enza by Dawn Meier you would find out that not only was there no panic but people were marvelous heroes and didn't run into the streets or commit suicide, but tried to help one another in a situation that was completely foreign to each citizen.Don't read this book as fact, it is just like a lot of other books in that it is gleaming a bunch of ""facts"" and saying it is true.A Bird Named Enza is a first-hand account of someone who lived through the influenza. Not a bunch of historical ""facts"" from some library.A BIRD NAMED ENZA"
2,A Must Read,"Well written and well researched. The book reads like a thriller. It documents the beginnings of the pandemic, the state of medicine and research at the time and the societal, medical and political responses to the threat.Extremely informative with a currency that doesn't fade with time."
2,Medical Profession Praise,Not near enough information about what a consumer could or should do to help themselves. I didn't realize this was a puff piece for the medical profession.
2,Deadly reading,"Although it is full of information about the pandemic of 1918, and the ""story"" of this event itself is fascinating, I found the book very poorly organized. The author did not follow a consistent plan for introducing the characters, describing the timeline of the pandemic, or illuminating the progress of medical science at this time and because of this event. All that info was there but not in a progression that was logical to follow."
3,Informative,I found this book to be very well researched and informative. It is a bit slow-moving at first because the author goes into great detail about the history of medecine and early American medical research.Sometimes it seems that the information given is in far too much detail which makes the reader forget the big picture of the flu epidemic.The scientific research and beliefs at the beginning of the 20th century are well-documented and presented.The biggest drawback to reading this book I found was the author's own choice of words and the use of many digressive sentences.It would have been much more enjoyable if it had been more plainly written.Sometimes the analysis of certain scientists own lives seemed to distract the reader from the gist of the book.Although a bit disjointed in its delivery this book still gives an accurate account of the events and conditions that lead up to the Great Influenza epidemic in 1918.Worth reading because of the modern threat from the avian flu virus.
4,A Comprehensive Look at History,Mr. Barry took his time and kept things interesting. I never lost interest or seemed like it was boring. There were a few multiple lines of things he had to describe but nothing overwhelming. I was impressed with his knowledge. He was able to find so much when there wasn't a lot of reporting done. People's lives were at stake and that was the main focus. They worked diligently night and day to find the cause of the illness so that they could produce a vaccination to curtail the deaths.This was a book that fascinated me from the beginning. I would definitely love to read more by this author. He has a way of captivating your attention from the very first page till the end. He makes history come alive in the pages but never condemns anyone for their actions. He just presents the whole picture of what happened and leaves it up to you to decide. A book to check out if you love History and want to get a good picture of a huge event that changed lives forever.
4,Historical yet spellbinding,"I was very surprised at how interesting and captivating I found this read to be. History buffs should like it, medical proffessionals should like it, and those of us who just want to understand exactly what did happen with the FIRST H1N1 flu will really enjoy this book. Its full of amazing facts during a time of great scientific advancement."
2,"Interesting nuggets, but needs major editing.","Fascinating to read about the early spread of influenza, and semi-competent government and doctor efforts to stop the spread. Interesting to compare to the present and how much higher our expectations are from the medical community and from doctors. Long lists of how many patients died in what army camp on what date. Come on, is that history? No graphs anywhere, and poor grasp of what facts are important and what facts are not. Useless descriptions of the medical men involved."
3,Great Start but Struggles in the Middle,The early chapters which focus on the status of medicine in the United States and Europe in the latter years of the 19th century and early 20th century are informative and well done.The biographies of the major dramatis personae are also interesting and informative.The repetitive descriptions of how the influenza overran the United States and most of the world become 'padding' and could have been handled in many fewer pages than Barry employs.With better editing this would have been at least four stars.
3,Interesting but Flawed,"The other reviews pretty much sum it up for me - a fascinating and little researched event spoilt by melodramatic inserts. These matter because it makes you treat some of his other claims with scepticism - for example, the idea that Wilson caved in to the French at Versailles because his mind was affected by sickness, leading to reparations and WWII ie one of the side effects of influenza was (...) shows a basic lack of understanding of Wilson's personality.What I found particularly fascinating, and which Barry covers very well, was the extent to which the government took over control of American daily life in the name of the war effort. The suspension of personal freedoms and control over dissent was scary.My biggest criticism though is that I was expecting a history of a global pandemic - this book really only covers the US, Barry mentions 20 million dying in India v 675,000 in the US but only in passing. Maybe they should change the title!"
4,Social history of the influenza epidemic,"This book is a wonderfully written description not just of an epidemic, but how the societal aspects of the situation in 1918 contributed, often unnecessarily, to the spread of the disease. Interesting personalities, and lessons for today."
1,worthy topic in search of editor,"Barry's book has some fine research and flashes of good writing, but it's obvious that he was paid by the word on this overwrought tome. I felt that I was reading a 6th grade history text. My advice to the author; select a worthy editor to put this book on a diet and reorganize your material. You will end up with a much more readable book and your readers will thank you for it."
2,This is a study of the scientists not the science,"I was disappointed in this book. First, it only looked at the USA and ignored the rest of the world (this was a world-wide pandemic). Second, and more importantly, this is a study of the scientists looking at the pandemic and how it changed American medicine. If you are looking for insights into influenza and the Great Pandemic, look elsewhere. The title and dust jacket are very decieving. Obviously, my gripe is more from my expectation that this was about influenza. It is well researched and well written. If you are looking for a tome on these scientist, the fantastic contributions they made, and the evalution of American medicine in the early 20th century, this is your book."
3,Good information but poorly written,"I appreciated the information in this book but it appears that Mr. Barry has never diagramed a sentence in his entire life. The sentence structure is very poor and there are far too many sentences overall. It is extremely repetative when trying to make different points about the same subject. The entire book could have been cut in half if Mr. Barry knew how to write.Where were the editors on this one? They certainly missed their opportunities.Also, in Chapter 28, page 323, he refers to a Mrs. George Wharton Pepper as being a descendant of Benjamin Franklin, which, in reality is rather a difficult thing to be since Mr. Franklin had no children."
4,Riveting account of the greatest pandemic flu epidemic in history,"John Barry has brought to life the many complicated characters and events surrounding the greatest pandemic flu epidemic of the last century - if not the deadliest in history. Multiple narratives give insight into the competition to find the cause of this human disaster that killed an estimated 100 million people worldwide beginning in 1918. Fascinating detail on the scientific process, as well as human behavior. It would have received five stars from me if more editing had been done to remove redundancies. Nevertheless, a very good read by an excellent writer and researcher."
4,Very informative.,"I found this book very interesting. I knew nothing of the influenza pandemic that ravaged the globe during World War I. Especially interesting to find out that the particular flu strain was actually H1N1. I now understand why there was such concern when the """"swine flu"""" broke out recently."
4,But its Only Influenza,"""But it's only influenza"" repeats the author like a refrain during the narrative of the most horrific days of 1918. Here's a book, written well before the current H1N1 pandemic, that described an earlier H1N1 outbreak that turned terrible on it's second wave. Includes lots of excellent background information on the scientists and epidemiologist at work before and during the outbreak. My biggest take-away from this book is the realization of how quickly our entire medical system would be overwhelmed by a pandemic of this size. Sobering indeed."
4,A good read for those interested in the history of American Medicine,"I have practiced medicine for over 30 years. I was trained in the US and have practiced in an academic setting for my entire career. I have visited Johns Hopkins, the Rockefeller, and seen the names of the principals involved countless times. However, I never understood their roles in history. For his reason alone I would recommend reading this book.The history described provides much of the lead up to the 1918 pandemic. Again, I have heard about this pandemic previously but I have little inkling regarding the actual scale of death and its impact on world events. It is a sobering book to read, but well worth it.The final chapters are the least valuable. If anything the author's commentary and speculation about the future actually detracts from the first portions of the book. It would have rated five stars in my estimation if not for the less than stellar final chapters."
3,"Dense with detail, full of melodrama","I read many reviews of this book, and finally had to buy it.This is a book you can easily put down! Dense with detail and many fascinating characters, but ruined by the melodramatic style. Along the lines of: "" Then suddenly, it struck with incredible force!"" Not an actual quotation, but you get the idea.Over and over again he uses this same device. It ultimately becomes tiresome. I'm about halfway through, and I have not picked it up in about 3 weeks.Hold out for the (used) paperback!"
5,"History, Hopefully not a Forecast","Today as I read the newspaper I learned that we had one more GI killed in Iraq. And there was a statement from the CDC that the new Avian Flu statement they made yesterday was too alarming. The new Avian Flu has a mortality rate of 72%, that is 72 people out of a hundred who catch it die.This book brings back the story of the Spanish Flu of 1918, which killed as many as a hundred million people. That's more people killed than the plague, or of World War I and World War II put together. (Some people say only [ONLY] 30 -40 million died.The book also uses this flu to talk about the changs in medicine brought out by the flu. Indeed this was the foundation of medicine as we know it today.This is a book that should be on everyone list, along with Laurie Garrett's books on the state of medical systems around the world today."
1,a scholarly disappointment,"This book celebrates some of the greatest intellects in American medical history, but fails utterly as a history of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Despite the death of over 50 million souls outside the US, ""The Great Influenza"" limits its international commentary to 3 pages of hasty statistics. The author thereby implies that the rest of the world was sitting on its hands waiting for America to come to its rescue, like a scene from ""Independence Day.""Given that American medical research was in its infancy in 1918, there were obviously dozens of physicians and scientists in England, Germany, France and elsewhere who were similarly involved in the frantic search for a cure. Their stories and identities are not mentioned, even briefly, in this book.Perhaps the book should have been subtitled, ""The American Response to the Plague."""
4,Frightening and informative,"A facinating window into a horrifying period that we've almost intentionally downplayed in our histories. It's especially worthwhile given the recent concerns about an inevitable pandemic. We are better equipped in some ways to deal with a worldwide pandemic, but in many others we are even more fragile. Viruses, like trade, move much more quickly now."
4,"Great, but a little too long","A haunting story that makes the current bird-flu virus even more scary. The author spends the first 100 pages or so describing the sad state of US medical education in the late 1800's and early 1900's and this section might seem too long, but otherwise it is an absolutely absorbing read. Mr President, isn't this a war we should be fighting? The influenza virus is truly the ultimate weapon."
4,A moving portrait of a natural disaster,"No American was left untouched by the Great Flu Epidemic, and Barry effectively illustrates the daunting scope of this great disaster. Through his exhaustive and detailed research, he shows the breadth of the influenza in the USA. Consider this: In one week, half again more people died in Philadelphia of influenze that died at the WTC on Sept. 11. Imagine the impact such a tragedy -- hundreds of thousands dying in a very short period of a seemingly unstoppable illness -- would have in today's American society. Comparisons to the Black Plague are exceedingly appropriate. This is an excellent and touching historical exploration, which also suggests humankind remains extremely vulnerable to epidemics."
3,Repeat repeat repeat,"I have this as an audio book. It started out as a well researched informative book. About 2/3 of the way through I realized that I had heard little that was new or different in the past 2 hours and gave up. It was repetitive, redundant, repeating himself and saying the same thing over in different words. I would have been a great book if it was about 1/3 the length with the repetition removed."
4,Complete description of nervous system tumors,"This book covers the pathology and genetics of nervous system tumors in a very clear and organized manner. It is a good reference book both for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis of different NS neoplasms as well as having a concise description of grading, name synonyms, histopathology and clinical signs. Recommended"
4,A fun book for duffers or pros.,"When I read the description on the jacket I thought, ""No way will this work. He's going to tell us about the 60 rounds he shot, stroke by stroke, such as.... and on the seventh, a tough par five, I got out my trusty three wood etc., etc., etc."" It is that but it is more. Slack shares with us the feeling of what it is like to stand at the first tee of a course you have never played on a beautiful spring morning in New England. He introduces us to the people he meets on the course, from the potato farmers of Maine to the Florida ""snowbirds"" who flew South to escape the Northern winters. Did the book work? I'm getting my clubs ready to try a West Coast version."
5,Borders and the National Interest,"In this, the Third Edition of Vernon Briggs' book, he offers a comprehensive study of the history of U.S. immigration. This is not the first time our laws have trailed behind facts supporting national action. You will find the book helpful in assessing the historic backdrop of immigration, and, as Briggs observes, The National Interest."
5,Oscar Knocks 'Em Out in Paris,"I'm a sucker for 'I Remember Clifford'-and after hearing Oscar's killer rendition of it on Youtube,I picked up this album with Oscar maybe at his killer best doing three live dates in Paris.Roy Eldridge adds a nice touch to 'But Not For Me'."
2,Dissapointing,"Sadly, Tim re-wrote this edition in prison I believe had a big 'thing' about getting off the planet due to that. Clearly lacking the Leary sense of self depricating humor and sly wit. Try his other works."
4,This is a more technical description on the Eight Neural Circuit model,This book is a more thorough and technical analysis of the Eight Neural Circuit Model of human consciousness. The diligent magical reader may more easily compare personal magical development to the circuits understood as general stages of consciousness evolution.
5,Excellent lectionary resource,"I tend to think of this series as the modern version of the Journey with the Fathers series. The difference is that this series uses texts from a latter era i.e. after the post-Nicean church fathers. Again the selections are on the gospels from the common lectionary - therefore, they should be of interest to a wide variety of readers.The readings are well selected and well edited - they should provoke useful ruminations on the Gospel for all readers. For this volume - Cycle B which corresponds to the Gospel of Mark - the selections include pieces by: Paul VI, Hugo Rahner, Paul Tillich, Catherine of Genoa, Anthony Bloom, Hildegard of Binger, Julian of Norwich ...."
3,Exceptional group with an ordinary debut,"Guitara is definitely unique. Western-style ballads and dance tracks make the group standout in the mosaic of Arabic music. However, this album, which is Guitara's first, is unfortunately very mediocre except for:8.Aziz El Nafs: My favorite track on this CD. Absolutely brilliant!9.Habibi: A beautiful duet; a ballad with vocals and guitar notes that will send shivers through your spine. Love it!These two songs earn the album 3 stars from me.I recommend getting Guitara's 2002 album ""Qisati"" instead of this one. Unfortunately, Amazon.com doesn't carry that title. That album is much, much better (4/5)."
1,3 Award -Winning War Games?,"Who the ... dishes out these awards? I admit that these games improve as the series prolongs (CC4 is the best thus far) but every part of this trilogy is a rip off. Perhaps I am being too picky. I would go into greater detail as to why this game bites, but this would be a very long list. I must admit the graphics and sounds are not bad, but the gameplay is horrible. Spend your money on a better war game, you'll be much happier. What else would you expect from Microsoft?Try a free game called Chain of Command."
5,The Best Strategy Game Ever,This game is a must have because it is one of the greatest strategy game ever. You can be from 5 allies including the Americans to the Germans. You can fight in the snow or inside buildings. TO LENINGRAD TO STALINGRAD
2,Hard to Get Through,"I have read several good Shannon Drake novels in the past and had high hopes for this one. However, the highlight for me was at the beginning when Warwick saved Ondine from being lynched. It all went downhill from there in my opinion.Drake was very accurate in her historical detail, and I did enjoy that. However, I grew tired very quickly of the sparring between these two characters. I really didn't see what either one of them saw in each other.I liked the ""gothic"" element of the plot, but it wasn't terribly original.All in all, a disappointment."
5,A Militia Primer,"This book should be in the training library of every Militia unit in America. If you can't muster to protect yourselves, you can revert to single man operations as resistance fighters."
1,Not worth full price,"This book is nothing more than a reprint of a 1965 military manual. While some of the information is interesting, it would have been much more interesting and useful had updated material been included. Save your money."
3,Wow,"What I love about all these books about the ""shadow wars"" is their failure to recognize that most such resistance movements fail over time against determined enemies. Every one of these books assume that the aggressor is some kind of dictator that can be toppled when ""the people"" decide to support the insurgents. Remember that these movements rarely succeed. Can anyone say SOUTH AMERICA, AFRICA maybe. Any movement can form regardless of popular support. Marxist guerrilas still fight in Chile and I don't see their government crashing down. And the guy who wrote the review about our ""red nation,"" my title was for you. Wow is all I can say to those enlightening remarks. You are the reason I hate discussing politics with anyone who buys into the Bushie/Moveon.org camp. And the only revolt that would occur in favor of the Dems would be in our bankrupt and decaying urban centers. Republicans control most areas not ""disadvantaged."" Just a simple observation from a Libertarian."
4,Be careful where you keep this book,"Having owned this book since 1975 (good old Paladin) i can say that British Special Forces read this book. Just don't carry it through airline security, in the UK you might get arrested (possession of material likely to be helpful to terrorism).Still relevant today."
3,a good guideline book,The book contains a summary of shelter all over the world as well as skilled builders. The book lacks with constructions details though.
5,"Until now, I've never spent 6 hours looking through a book of pictures","followed by several days flipping through again and again, searching for my favorites...beautiful pictures. I could have done with more ""on the road"" pics and less (what I would refer to as) ""normal"" houses...I can see those kinds when I look out the window...but that's just a personal preference....I wish he'd take all the extra stuff he said he had and put it on a website or publish another book. I'd buy it!"
5,Beautiful book,The book came as described and has many wonderful creative houses in it. Makes me want to get building now.
1,home work hand built shelter,This book is such a rip. Anybody could duplicate this book by searching through the internet.It is no more than a series of pictures. There is no construction method or anything like that.If you are looking for a book with pictures of different types of homes this is it. But remember it is not much more than pictures.
5,Delightful short stories,"This book is a collection of short stories about two little girls and the animals who live on a farm in rural France. All of the animals on the farm have their own personalities and talk. Indeed, they have a lot to say. The little girls get into some dreadful fixes, and more often than not run astray of their parents' strict rules. The stories often have moral undertones, and while some of the attitudes may be dated by the standards of modern society, the tales themselves transcend time.My training in French consists of a year of college study some 20 years ago. Nevertheless, with the occasional assistance of a bilingual dictionary, I was able to read this book with ease. Reading this book provides a delightful way to brush up on or polish your skills in French. Of course, if you read French fluently, you will appreciate this book for the classic that it is."
3,Take My Advice...,"This Lego set leaves little to be desired. It is very simple to put together and with hardly any moving parts. Lego can sometimes make disappointing features. There are two doors that open up on the podracer itself but once open all you see is a black block. A nice little engine or motor part would enchance the fun of this feature considerably. This set may be good to get some SW Lego characters like Padme and Qui Gon Jin, but I would suggest any avid Lego collector go for the Pod Race Set from Lego. Not only does it contain this plus two awesome pod racers, it is better value for your money."
3,They are fun but not as good as...,Yeah i don't think this toy is that detailed either but it is fun to play with. I wish they at least made clear peices connecting the pod to the engines. It would look alot better that way. After buying this and being dissapointed i am now only spending my money on the Ultimate Star Wars Collectors edition which features the xiwing and tie-interceptor that are very sleek and cool looking. they come out in june and i am buyiing almost every set.
4,Fun but ...,This toy was fun but not as durable as other Lego toys. This one comes apart easily and you have to be careful with it when you play. It's not as educational as other Legos either.
5,multiple uses,I used this glue to make Batik banners in a summer school class with 10 8th graders. Worked great. The kids loved the sparkles in the glue.
3,PLEASED 3 1/2 STARS,"IF THIS WERE OUR PRIMARY SET I'D GIVE IT A 3 1/2. SINCE THIS IS A SECONDARY ""KITCHEN SET"" I GIVE IT 4 STARS. OVER ALL WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS TV. SHARP DID THE WORK AND IT CARRIES THEIR WARRANTY. THE PICTURE IS SHARP [no pun intended],CLEAR AND THE COLOR IS GREAT. THE DOWNGRADE COMES FROM THE LACK OF QUALITY IN THE AUDIO. IT'S MORE ""TINNY"" THAN WE LIKE AND THERE IS NO TONE CONTROL TO CORRECT THAT. NOR IS THERE AN OUTPUT FOR EXTERNAL SPEAKERS. GREAT VALUE AT $349. WILL UPDATE THIS IF PROBLEMS ARISE."
3,Cute but horrible steering!,"I love the look and the way you can change the way the baby faces. But this stroller has the WORST steering ever! And the wheels are super cheap and skinny. Can only take this on sidewalks. Baby nice and comfy though, cushy seat. Fold up lever is a pain, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If I could do it again, I would buy something else."
5,Uplifting Message,"Ogilvie takes you through the Beatitudes from atop the Mount of Olives. He wrote the book on location and searched for just the right inspiration in examining each Beatitude. The book is very uplifting and enjoyable to read and Ogilvie gets to the heart of the matter while bringing insight into the Beatitudes. He writes about an Irish nurse who was struggling with her conscience after helping a wounded IRA leader whose victims she had also treated over the years. Ogilvie does a splendid job of relating that Jesus came to heal the sick, the lame and broken-hearted. The poor in spirit who recognize their need for God are the ones that are truly blessed."
2,Avoidism 1958 Style,"Recenly, I read Roger Prices book, which was written in the 50s. It had not only humor of its day, but I found it to be ahead of its time, and relevant to today. The examples were outrageous, and the drawings were crass, but the ideas he came up with were no different than the way the average person of the 2000s might think, although not say so publicly, as Roger did. One example in particular which illustrated 1 man as a handsome hunk, who wanted to be an avoidist, with the end result, showing what not to look like, is the average good looking guy of today. Roger put alot of his own opnions in, but the book was interesting enough for me to look his name up, and see his future."
4,Alright!!!,"I gave this movie 4 stars because of the ending which I thought was realistic...Faced with being killed/consumed by those creatures or going out on my own terms, I would have chosen the latter....Anyway, I liked the fact the movie showed us that as a society no matter how much we may strive to be better human beings that when fear is involved we are more dangerous to ourselves and others than that which we fear.I hope that made sense.....Anyway, the special effects were great, especially the scene near the ending with this monstrous creature which I watched several times because it was so cool!!!Having not read Stephen King's book, the movie reminded me of the Dean Koontz book I read a while back called, The Taking, which I really liked.So, overall I recommend this movie..."
2,Another lame Stephen King adaptation,"Two hours worth, mind you. Vacant, gory, cgi-laden snoozer. Marcia Gay Harden does the best she can as a religious nutcase, somewhat satisfying to see her die but other than that this is boring as all get-out. I'm starting to wonder-does King get lost in translation, or is the source material bad and I didn't notice as a kid?"
3,mainly insects in the mist...,"...along w/ reptilian & aquatic type critchas. the only 2 scenes showing the mist on the horizon at first and then it coming into town were way too brief and few. the creatures where entertaining, though there could have been a lil' more in this sorta too long film-i mean a lil' borin. the overstating, crazed lady character in the film brought up the climax til she was gone. disliked by me was when most of the main and good characters were disposed of in a car at the end. at the end is a brief scene of mainly a giant reptile thing walking along slowly and then the military moving along ""cleaning up shop"" w/ (flame throwers?)."
3,Better than most remakes,This movie could have been a lot better or more suspenseful. Some of the CGI gets cheesy which makes it lose points in my book. The crazy christain lady was overtly annoying in my opinion and could've been handled in a darker tone to fit the movie better instead of the parody it was. One of the only saving qualitites was the ending which was excellent. If the entire movie would have that dark of a tone then this movie would have been awesome.
2,Another Beer Would Have Been Better,"The Mist is another example of extraordinary special effects talent mismatched with horrid direction and writing. Were it not for special effects one would think one was having an out-of-joint conversation with a schizophrenic. The truly ponderable thing about this movie is how a ninth-grade film class, apparently, came by the big money to produce it."
3,Not the Best Stephen Kin Film I've Seen!!!,"I love the way the creatures look, including the huge ones! Everybody did a real good job of turning against each other, because of the religious freak, Mrs. Carmody. David; his son, Billy, Amanda, Dan, and Irene soon become the only sane people in the store. Everyone else slowly goes crazy. Will anyone escape the creatures? If you love Stephen King movies, and hilarious endings, you'll love THE MIST!!!"
2,Beautiful cinematography. Terrible script adaptation.,"I usually like the screen adaptations of King's works better than I like the books. Not so with this one. Although the movie is technically brilliant (the effects are gorgeous, the sound amazing), the philosophical aspects of the story are turned into facile, heavyhanded propaganda saved only by the fine cast. Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harding were amazing, but the lesser-known actors were pitch perfect. William Sadler was great, really great.I won't spoil the ending. I will say that I thought it sacrificed coherence for shock value and that I didn't like it. I did like the performances and the work done by the drew. It was only the adaptation of the story I didn't like."
3,Just OK,This movie was just OK. Not alot of substance and a force fed look into the human psyche. Why does Stephen King always try to point out our obvious human/animalistic traits and call it new? This movie had a few scary and suspensfull moments which I liked but this movie was just OK. The ending was retarded. I get why one or two ppl might feel hopeless but the whole group after fighting so hard to survive?? Whatever. This movie would have been better if it had any ending but this one. And whats up with guys acting in the last scene? Talk about forced. All in all this movie was worth the watch but I doubt i'll be adding it to my personal collection. Looking for a movie that actualy entertains or tells a story not this obvious rehash or stuff for shock value...I can get that from Jerry Springer.
1,I hated this movie!!,"The movie was well done and suspenseful. The characters were well developed, but the ending ruined the entire experience. With just a little change this could have been excellent, but there is no good reason to make the movie have such a heartwrenching, depressing ending."
1,Absolutely horrible movie,"The dialog is weak, the acting wooden, the plot thin the end predictable. The Mist is a perfect storm of terrible movie making. The only redeeming part, ironically enough, is Toby Jones' performance as a grocery store clerk. My advice is to stay clear of this Stephen King adaptation."
2,dumb ending,"i like just about any horror film and i acquire any film that even smells like it has lovecrafty parts to it.the problem with this film is the ending, not that i wanted a tidy hap liv ely aver efter ending, i dont like those either but the issue for me was that i never felt they were really at the end of their rope for such a drastic measure. he wasnt compassionate and doing the right thing, he was a loser who couldnt take it anymore and assumed the boy felt the same way, Lord save us from good intentions. fight or flight? well this idiot chose neither, his solution ruined the movie."
2,Bad ending ruined the whole movie.,I thought this sounded like a good movie so I went and rented it. It was good up until the ending scene. It made me sad and pissed off all at the same time. I can't believe they would have an ending like this one. And as for the God preaching lady she made some of the movie just annoying. No offense to any church goers out there. If you plan to watch this movie please rent it before you spend the 20-30 bucks buying it.
1,OK horror movie BUT...,"About 60% of this movie was decent, but the religious zealot was way overdone and extremely cliche and annoying. My main problem with this movie is the ending. Honestly, there should be a warning on the case. The fact that they had the father kill his child is repulsive and intolerable. This dvd isn't going to the resale shop, it already went right into the trash."
4,What An Ending!,"We're ALL aware of the film itself, so this will briefly about the discs themselves. Both discs, The original version with extras, and the exclusive black & white version with intro from the director, look incredible! And the Dolby TrueHD sound envelops around yo for true scares out of nowhere... Internet features, some deleted scenes, running commentary, and a killer award-winning performance by Marcia Gay-Harden!"
4,the mist,not bad of a movie it could have took place in more than just the store and the ending kinda sucked
5,If only...,That's how I feel about a lot of Stephen King's stories. Full of suspense and irony. If only I watched it sooner. Very good acting.
4,"Watch at your own risk: Campy, and it's supposed to be.","The Mist is perfect for the connoisseur of bad, sci-fi movies. It's got that pleasantly accessible made-for-TV quality you might find in, say, the Benjamin Bratt ""Andromeda Strain"" remake, and most of the acting is, if not stellar, utterly passable. (That said, a few actors -- Marcia Gay Harden in particular, but also Thomas Jane -- bring the overall quality of acting from inoffensive to outright enjoyable.) The reasons to watch are the Stephen King plot, Harden's gorgeously campy evangelizing, and shamelessly absurd special effects. The end is almost refreshingly dark..."
2,The Mist,The video was not great in terms of quality and I think the script was plodding. Too predictable although the ending was different
2,'Mist' opportunity,"Nice buildup, some excellent acting, good atmosphere early on as the mystery mist closes in and people start to crack under the pressure of fear and uncertainty. But the special effects are, in a word, ludicrous: if you thought the CGI spiders in the ""Lost in Space"" remake were cheesy, wait 'til you see the pinstriped models attacking people in the parking lot. And while I have no problem with downbeat endings, the ending Frank Darabont cooked up for this story is simply cold and nasty. Not recommended."
1,Stupid Characters doing stupid things,"It seems the writer intended this movie to be a sort of morality tale about the frailty of humanity and the depths to which people will sink in the face of fear and the unknown. He failed miserably. The characters are unrealistic archetype caricatures, all of which are unbelievably stupid and slow to act in the diferent situations that arise in the movie. Apparently the only archetype not represented is that of rational humane man. Everyone's first instinct is to either kill someone else or start offing themselves like lemmings. This was a terrible movie. Do not waste your time."
1,Putting the horror in horrible,"This was certainly one of the scariest movies I have seen in recent years. The dialog was so bad it nearly scared me to death. The rubber monsters and use of the mist to conceal them, not so much.It is scary to think that someone was paid to write the tripe that is coming out these poor actors' mouths. BTW, I think the acting was great. It took tremendous acting skills to spout such absurd lines and act like they weren't utter nonsense.On the bright side, the monsters do nail quite of few of these incredibly annoying and fake characters, just not soon enough."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this one,"This was very disappointing. There's not much else to say about it. The acting was bad, the movie was a spin off of Aliens, and it was just too predictable. I kept having to ask myself ""is this really a Stephen King movie?"" because it kept reminding me of those ""B"" rated cheap horror flicks.If you like cheap, ""B"" rated, gruesome, bloody, chop em up and show all type horror flicks.. you'll love this one."
3,Why GOD?!...Why?!,"One time when I was littler, I took a creative writing class and this is what Mrs. Pratt the writing lady told us, ""If you want to make a scary story, you have to put a baby in it that kills stuff with a meat hook.""I said, ""That sounds scary.""She said, ""It is.""I didn't see one single baby killin' stuff with a meat hook in this movie.This could have been really good if Mrs. Pratt the writing lady writed it, and Jeff Goldblum directed some of it.Three Stars for killin' almost everybody in the movie. Booyah!Shout out to my peeps! Yo!"
1,Don't Bother...,"This otherwise creative and intriguing author has created his worst movie ever. The main plot was a bit corny, somewhat scary...I suppose, and a bit boring. Then comes the ending...I was so disgusted and dissapointed, I wanted to vomit. Tsk, tskThis author has a created a great number of movies (and books) over the years that are interesting, unique, and that exceed expectations that are well worth watching. So, do youself a favor, and choose one of his other DVDs, you'll be happy you did :)"
1,"Borderline bad movie with a ""Horrible"",& most non-redeaming ending","I can't believe what I just watched.I know King is bizarre but after sitting through a B-movie like scare flick, I had to watch a father shoot his own son -to save him- only to have the military arrive minutes later???? That is just wrong.I watched TV-like special effects, people sacrifice eachother, murder, and bloody/gross scenes only to be confronted with an unimagineal ending of killing your own son??If you even think of buying, renting , or watching this movie you should have your head examined. How do I get back that 2 hrs of my life?"
4,If you liked the book; you'll like the film.,I loved the book when I read it. The film is just as good. Not much else to say. Another film that is just too scary because it is possible to happen for real. Yikes!
3,Still can't believe the ending!,"The movie was great! Everything was exciting and breathtaking, until the end! NO WAY would they fight as hard as they did to stay alive, just to end it like that. Don't you think they would have waited a little longer before ending thier lives. I mean, come on!!! They run out of gas and within 5 minutes they give up!!! They could have sat there and waited. Yea, they didn't have food, but you can go a few days without food. It just wasn't believable that they fought as hard as they did to get away and then after 5 minutes decide to die! VERY upsetting ending! You didn't see it coming, but it just wasn't believable at all!"
2,Just can't beat the book,"Let me preface this by saying that the special effects stunning and the acting was pretty good. In addition, I am fan of Stephen King's work and loved this story in print.However, the director or the writers or whoever decided to mess with the ending of this tale. The message sent at the end of the movie was pointless and cruel. Stick with the book, you will have a better experience."
4,A real HORROR movie,I didn't like the ending. I can't tell you why only it depressed me. The rest of the movie was very good. Sort of remined me of a Twlight Zone or Outer Limits episode. The monsters in the mist were scary. It had a creative plot to it. I just wish the ending had been better for me. The ending for me is what made it a REAL HORROR ending.
4,The Mist,"A storm hits a small town and a man, his son and wife awake to find their house damaged and his paintings in ruin. So he, his son and a neighbor which he has strained relations with head into town to the store for supplies and repair items as a strange mist creeps over the lake. Soon they learn there is something in the mist. Something alien, alive and hungry for them. They're trapped in the grocery and neighbor turns on neighbor before long. This film was very good, well done but I HATED the end. I guess it was suppose to, but, still damaged the film for me."
4,Literary master of horror meets thematic master of horror,"I read ""The Mist"" in one of Stephen King's short story collections some years ago, and watched this film adaptation for the first time last year. The movie stays very true to the book, which means that it's a gut-punching horror. The monsters in the mist are only part of the problem as the viewer gets to witness the degradation of human psyche and civilization. That is the true horror here. Frank Darabont, one of my favorite directors, does a wonderful job here in eliciting such emotion from his actors, and this is a film that you will sit through the credits, mouth agape."
5,myst,"Arrived early and played without any problems. Great story and good actors, special effects were good too. I bought it because every store in the 3 county area didn't have it or couldn't tell me if it cound be ordered!"
4,Good Movie...,This was a good movie. The story was a little strange. But I very much think it was worth the watch. I will probably rent this again to watch with my girlfriend.
3,be careful when opening doors to another dimension,"The Mistjust because there's a mist does not mean you will not see anything. Out of it will come creatures from another dimension, from a doorway the government accidentally opened. Plenty of drama and action, with some gore and blood. But this one will leave us with an ending so tragic we want to rewrite it. I'll not tell you more and spoil the movie. By this one if you can."
4,this mist is a welcome relief.,"This is a movie that is both cool and unsettling all at the same time.Although after a freak storm this mist appears across the lake.Why? Nobody knows and you think Steven King will tell you.Wrong again! If you've seen Shawshank Redemption or the Green Mile,Frank Darabont doesn't use excessive blood flow but relies heavily on the suspense.Its called Macabe people.Anyway Thomas Jane was ok but a little soft spoken which gave him an eerie persona to begin with.It seems the normal down to earth people get oft quickly.I was beginning to wonder if it was safer in the store or trying to get to their vechicles.I was going to rent this but they were out.....So I bought it...good investment."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,This movie leaves you feeling emotionally beat-up. It's absolutely terrible and made us angry we spent our evening watching it.
1,Kill me now.,"If you read... If you like your movies based on books to resemble the book it was based on...If you have any humanity whatsoever...DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS.This ""movie"" (and i do use the term sarcastically) takes a wonderful short story by Stephen King into the back room of an underground club, does unspeakable things to it, then tells it to put the lotion in the basket.The ""screenwriter"" (and i do use the term sarcastically... YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!) has killed a good story. He has killed it, and done bad things to the body..."
1,BORING AND STUPID,"This movie was such a waste of my time and I feel as though I wasted 126 minutes of my life on this crap. It was just so horrible. I dont even know why it was bad but it was just bad. This is just my opinion but if you like sci fi movies with giant bugs that for some reason were able to come and live in our world because some military men opened a portal, then be my guest. This movie made no sense and then all of a sudden it ends with the military that dissapeared coming back to kill the bugs/monsters. They manage to come back righ after the main guy shoots his son and friends, what a great movie. It was horrible, dont bother."
1,dreadfully horrible,"I'm not sure how this movie could get good reviews? The characters are completely unlikable and unbelievable while also being used for social commentary. The movie was much too long and they could have edited 30-40 minutes out (or more). I watched the black-and-white version because I'm an early film fan, but this movie doesn't even deserve having a black-and-white version. Not to mention the snap-zooms and other poor techniques that are uncharacteristic of black-and-white cinema. The ending for the movie barely made it more interesting and overall I would recommend this title to nobody."
1,Worst ending ever,"The movie was actually pretty good up until the last few minutes. Before the ending, the movie was about struggling for survival and using everything you've got to protect the ones you love (yes, that includes not abandoning your own child to walk a woman home in monster filled mists). The ending changes the message, making the moral of the story: sit on your [...] and if you aren't killed by the crazy religious nuts, random people will swoop in and rescue you. As an added bonus, apparently will to survive only lasts for a couple of hours. Then you just randomly give up."
1,Awful,"If you liked the movie Seven and enjoy a movie with a horrible, gut wrenching ending then I guess you'd like this. However I was hoping for a scary movie, what I ended up with was a story with a crazy sad and awful ending."
2,This wasn't supposed to be funny.....right?,"Horror and humor walk a very thin and blurry line, don't they? There are so many unintentionally humorous moments in this film that it's hard to pick just one. The acting is substandard, the people do stupid things, and the characters are one-dimensional.The ending is also unsatisfying because it is not made clear that the military is wiping out the creatures and saving everyone everywhere, and we don't know just how far the mist spread.It did get two things right: 1) when civilization and technology are taken away, people go ""Lord of the Flies"" on each other--taking sides, choosing scapegoats, and letting fear get the best of them.2) the existential horror at the very end, when the man discovers that waiting a few more minutes could have saved several lives, is quite disturbing."
1,A Major Dissapointment,"I haven't read the book so I don't know who to blame, but this just didn't work on any level. The plot had great potential: a window to an alternate universe opened by a military experiment gone bad, and the residents of a small town caught in the vortex. Sadly, instead of exploring the virtually unlimited possibilities for frightenting and enlightening circumstances, the story immediately bogs down into a hysterical drama.What little shock the movie attempted to deliver was diminished by the apathy I felt for the cast of cliched characters (apocalyptic religous zealots, bumbling redneck locals, and of course the evil military). Even the ending of this movie, which I will admit was somewhat shocking, just did not ring true. Ultimately the mist was necessary as a plot device to obscure a really poor and underdeveloped story."
1,Don't waste your time watching this movie,"This movie started out with serious potential. That is up until they get stuck in the grocery store. The schizophrenic psychotic so called christian really bothered me? Hollywood, give me a break. The majority of the movie is about mob mentality. The ending is the worst I've ever seen in a movie. After all they went through they run out of gas and then give up within 5 mins?! Seriously? Give me a break. Why exactly didn't they atleast try to stop and get gas? Painkillers in the pharmacy was worth the hastle, but not gas.."
1,"Gore, violence, what's the point?","I was disappointed after reading glowing reviews. I read King's novella and thought it was entertaining, but the movie is a disaster in my judgment. It is filled with stomach-churning violence, gore, dismemberments, tiresome characters, and a pointless subplot. There is never any real explanation of the connection to the military experiment or the sudden appearance of the same in the last scene. I agree with King's point about human nature under stress, however--I saw the aftermath of Katrina."
1,This movie could have been a 5+++++,"This could have been one of the greats. The story is suspenseful and atmospheric and the action is wonderful. Some of the characters actions are debatable, but this is a fantasy movie, don't look too much into them. However, the movie only gets 1 star because the ENDING SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! The whole movie followed King's short novella perfectly until the Jackass 'powers that be' changed the ending and ruined everything. The whole movie was exactly like the book except for that. Please watch the 1st 90% of the movie, save yourself anguish and turn it off, and then read the novella."
1,HORRIBLE ENDING,"This is one of my favorite Stephen King stories and I was excited that it finally came to the screen. I must address the ending because that's what you leave the theatre with. It's not King's ending and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the ending was gratuitously mean and dark and totally out of character with the rest of the movie. It's a Saturday matinee monster popcorn movie (it aint gonna be mentioned alongside The Godfather) with a little religious fervor thrown in. It's NOT the kind of the movie that ends with a father putting a bullet in his son's head and then minutes later having the cavalry show up. The ending was cruel, mean-spirited and unearned and that's why it was a complete flop at the box office. People left with a bad taste in their mouth (I saw it opening night and the ENTIRE audience booed) and people told their friends to avoid it. What a waste."
3,sad,this was a very bad king movie. First off from the very beginning the father whos kid is in shock disides to be the hero and abandons his boy for most of the movie. Second they made the mot stupied choices i have ever seen i mean they risk 3 lives for a person that dies 5 mins later and all these people are really clumsy and stupied i really didnt like this movie compared to other king movies
3,Very good but could have been made even better,"I have not yet read Stephen King's original story, although I do know how it ends. I did find like many others, the film's ending to be a great shock. While the original story ends inconclusively, at least it was at to me anyway preferable to the abrupt film finale. There are many great and gripping moments in the film and the acting is generally very good and certainly above average for a film of this type. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as ""Mrs. Carmody"" the religious fanatic. The film is generally well-mounted and quite suspenseful throughout. A bit puzzling though are the fates of several key characters who leave the supermarket to venture out into the mist and are not seen or mentioned again. The cause of the mist is not actually given either, only guessed at. The film is very good but not perfect and could have been made a whole lot better. Definitely worth seeing though."
3,Okay version of story,"Have to say visually, this movie was great. Really brought the short story to life. Have to also say the story was so much more indepth of the situation. It's the little details that should have followed onto the holywood version."
3,ending not consistent with the characters,"The entire movie focused on the few characters who could ultimately take the big chance to survive. Ending it with a mass murder/suicide of these characters just struck me as unrealistic and inconsistent with their personalities.Enjoyed the film up to the end, it was otherwise quite well done. Ending it this way struck me as shock for shocks sake . I won't watch it again"
2,The fog versus the giant mantis,"Sorry but this is one of those run-of-the-mill monsters in the dark or creeps in the fog movies. The monsters are not scarier. The victims are standard group. Some are heroes, some are rats, and some are just fillers. If nobody gets out alive, we will be better off.The miracle is how they can think of new deadly fog things for two hours and seven minutes without getting bored. It's a wonder that somebody can watch for two hours and seven minutes without using the fast-forward button. I suggest that you keep the fast-forward button handy right after the beginning credits. You can push it until the ending credits, and you will have saved two hours and nearly 7 minutes.Basic story Mist finds town, people hide in store, some people stick nose out, nose does not return.Both ""The blob"" and the ""Deadly Mantis."" Have more structure, suspense, and social redeeming value.Deadly Mantis (1957)The Blob - Criterion Collection"
5,Scary & Suspenseful!,I loved this movie! It's Stephen King at his best! The movie was both scary & suspenseful. Thomas Jane & Marcia Gay Harden gave incredible performances. I would recommend this movie to any horror film buff or anyone who just wants a good scare!
5,A most outstanding horror film!,"I saw this movie in the theater. Not many movies keep me on edge, but this one did. Many people try to compare King's books to his movies. The simple truth: You can't! As a movie-adaptation of a novel, this might be only average to good... but as a horror film, I think it's magnificent. It pushed the right buttons for me. Scary parts were scary, sad parts were sad and funny parts were funny. The cast and special effects were all top notch, and the story did feel like a Stephen King story (though it may not have flowed exactly as the book did.) Ultimately, get this movie."
1,SENT WRONG PRODUCT,"I received the wrong product. I wantd to buy the mist remake on blu ray, what I got was the original black and white version. I sent an email to the vendor. It has been nearly 1 month and know reply."
3,"Not bad movie, but disturbing...","Not the best movie. Could have been a little shorter, and has a disturbing ending that is not for the weak or sensitive. Not actually too bad otherwise, but the ending is still bothering me the next day..."
5,Excellent,"Just wanted to cast my 5-star vote for this excellent movie. I'm no conossoiur, but I enjoyed it thoroughly; my mouth was agape several times from pure shock at the story twists.Stephen King has definitely overcome his problem with crappy endings (I'm thinking mainly of the giant spider in ""It"") - The Mist has probably the best (surprise) ending I've seen, which pushes ""Birdy"" (Matthew Modine, Nicholas Cage) out of the #1 spot for ""best endings in a movie"" of all time. ;)Also note: I watched the DVD over a month after I bought it...and it froze up repeatedly throughout the movie. The return period had elapsed, so I had to keep it. A year later (same DVD player) I watched it and was pleased and shocked that I had no issues. Glad I never fired off that angry letter to the manufacturer."
4,Excellent old fashioned bug monster movie. Quite scary.,"Watching the movie I felt like a little kid watching ""The Crawling Eye"" for the first time. It's not Oscar material of course, but it's great within the horror genre. Some of the characterizations and dialogue isn't great, but who cares? It's a horror movie and the best one of it's type, i've seen, in quite a while."
3,No Fun At All Monster Movie,"Let's make some popcorn, turn down the lights, and watch a scary monster movie! ....That was the original idea of this story....A 50's style ""saturday night creature feature"".... Stephen King said so himself....However, somewhere along the way, the makers of this film went way off into socio-political metaphor and a depressing representation of the human condition...The result is a completely humorless,cautionary tale. This is probably the area where I part company with those who love this film. I was expecting it to be enjoyable as well as scary. Still worth a look, though. It has some great monsters & creepy crawlies (in spite of it's ""lack of fun"")."
3,"Good Movie, Bad Ending","Am a big fan of the story, which I read years ago. So waiting for the movie to come out on DvD, the day that it did I ran out and picked it up. Great movie, all the way up until the end. Then the director really screwed it up, at least in my humble opinion. There was so many ways for this movie to end, hell leave it the way King did. This is a movie that I will probably not watch again, just because of that. (SPOILER ALERT) It just wasn't the way they did it, but it was so out of character. I mean, they survive and fight, then bam thats it, were done."
2,A roller coaster where your best friend dies.,"This was a great ride...until the end. Ups and downs. Loops. Thrills and chills. Great acting, writing, and directing. But an ending that goes against the grain suddenly and violently with minutes to go does that in. Just like going on a great roller coaster ride, but your friend sitting beside you falls out at the end and is killed. The ride may have been great, but the horrible ending ruins what was one a great thing. That's all you can remember.Just like ""SAW"", if it doesn't make sense in and of itself, then of course your surprised.Oh, well. We still have the outstanding written work."
1,"Unimaginative, predictable crap!",Even made for cable flicks are better. Save your money. DVR it when on tv and watch it with friends so you can all make fun of it together :)
1,POS bluray... don't bother,"Tried to play this blu-ray on PS3 and it kept crapping out on me towards the end of the movie. Had to reboot PS3 several times while watching the movie, made for a very stressful experience, unenjoyable. The movie seemed like a good adaptation of the short story but the DVD/blu-ray experience of it continuing to hang up towards the end of the movie ruined the viewing experience. Maybe the lo-def DVD version might be better without the ill-converted blu-ray format getting in the way of the experience."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This movie was just a plain waste of time to watch. Nothing scary and the ending was pitiful and totally lacked imagination. Obviously this director has no theological knowledge and falls for the same old blah, blah, blah anti-Christian stereotypes that are so wearisome, as was evidenced by the lame character, Mrs. Carmody. Shock value: zero, clever directing: non-existant, attempt to have a unique ending: a fizzle.Save your money, pass on this one. Wasn't even worth our free rental coupon!"
1,Awful ending that betrays the original,"Awful ending, as pointless as you'd find in any low budget one-star made-for-TV movie on the SyFy Channel. A total betrayal of Stephen King's original ending, and of the art of story telling in general."
3,9.26.08,"This was a decent movie but the special effects could have been a bit stronger. More than once I wondered if I was watching another remake of ""War of the Worlds"" but the ending was a true shocker."
5,Amazing 2 Disc Set,The Mist is one of my all favorite Stephen King movies..I recorded it every time it came on cable but I finally decided to buy it so I could watch it when ever I wanted...the extras are great!
3,Pretty decent,"Okay, to start of, I read the short story that this movie is based on, and I must say I was pleased with how well it followed the story. Okay, and also, the acting is great, and the thrills and suspense of this movie are top-notch. The characters are good, and the way they play out is great. The reason I only give this movie 3 out of 5 stars is because of the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone just in case you haven't seen it, I'm just gonna say that it was such a heart-wrenching gut-punch, it was just so... Man. The ending is really one of the only things this movie differs from the short story in. Man, that ending... Good or bad? You decide. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,typical Stephen King,"I was so excited when I heard this movie was being made. It is one of my favorite Stephen King short stories. His imagination and attention to details has always brought his books to life for me and they did a great job on the special effects that made this movie exactly how I imagined it to be. That said I hated the ending, that is the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves. I think one of the things I enjoyed about the story is it never had a definite ending and it made you think and wonder. All in all I am glad I saw it and would recommend it to others."
4,What would you do?,"That's my question. If you watch the movie and was faced with the same situation the main character faced at the ending what would you do? Of course you have to see the movie to know what I mean. The Mist is a wild movie that, at times, gets your heart racing and your goose bumps showing. For a good part of the beginning you are left wondering, ""What is in the mist?"" There were some parts that had me excited and wondering what's going to happen next. The movie was good, and if you like horror flicks you will like this movie."
4,Surprisingly Good,"With the exception of Carrie (Sissie Spacek version) and Misery, most adaptations of Stephen King stories have been disappointing. The Mist however, must be added to the short list of good ones. It is scary, suspenseful, and unpredictable. While the film features some great monsters, one could easily replace them with a terrorist attack or nuclear disaster. The film is really about how thin the veneer of civilization is when humans are faced with catastrophe. I particularly liked Marcia Gay Harden's character, the town ""crackpot"" who becomes a charismatic (and allegedly psychic) religious leader when things begin to go very badly. Some reviewers complained about the ending. While grim, I thought it was perfect, suggesting one should fight to the end and never give up hope prematurely."
2,The disturbing ending ruined it for me,"I thought 90% of the movie was excellent and hewed very closely to Stephen King's novella about a military experiment gone bad. I was all set to give it four stars. And then...there was that ending. I was very disappointed by the disturbing final scene of the movie, which, I believe, was gratuitously unnecessary. It changed a story that had an open-ended yet hopeful ending to a big screen episode of the Twilight Zone. While Rod Serling is one of my favorite writers, this film's ending did not jibe with what came before it. What was the rush? There were no monsters near by and, had they waited, the soldiers may have appeared and saved them all. It seems to make the film a vindication of Mrs. Carmody and gives credence to her religious rants. Should Frank Darabont decide to re-release this film at some future time with an ending more in tune with the novella, I believe it I would rate it a four star film."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great.",This movie is pretty good. I really liked this movie but the ending seriously let me down. It is worth watching but don't expect to much or you will be dissapointed.
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Stephen King fan and love most of his books and movie adaptations. However, this film was a real stinker. The biggest problem I had with this film were the characters. Non of them came across as being very bright and just weren't very likeable. As characters die, you find yourself quietly cheering rather than feeling any sense of sadness or disappointment. The acting was sub par and the overall story line was really weak. And it all dragged on for over 2 hours. I would only recommend this film for diehard King fans who want to see everything he does."
3,The ending is so messed up!!!!,"This was a pretty good movie, pretty fast paced, a little scary. The cast was good. However the ending is SOOOOO Messed up. This movie will not disappoint!!!"
1,Christian bashing at its finest,"This refers to Marcia Gay Harden's character. It is interesting to note that Hollywood often misrepresents Christians as either Bible quoting psychos or knife wielding schizophrenics (""There Will be Blood""). It's politically incorrect of vilify Muslims, Buddhists, Wiccans, Satanists, New Agers and athiests. But hey, in Hollywood, Christians are fair game. Such misrepresentation reminds of a subtle version of Hitler's anti-semitic propaganda just before the Nazis hauled the Jewish people into the concentration camps."
4,ONE OF THE BEST MONSTER MOVIES IN A LONG TIME!,"I have to say I've grown tired of monster films in recent years as they all seem to have one thing in common.....they suck! 'The Mist' is a great example of taking the best from the old and the best from the new and blending them together for a damn good thriller! The FX are very good, the atmosphere is creepy and the tension is high in this well acted deliberately paced horror/sci-fi throwback to the days of drive-ins! I couldn't help but think of my old PS2 game 'Silent Hill' a little watching this film, with it's thick mist and sirens hauntingly sounding in the background. The two disc DVD edition is especially nice with a cool black and white version on the film, plus enough extras to keep any monster fan happy for a while!"
5,Excellent Learning Material,"I have read several MDX related books and there are in my opinion three categories of those: books where MDX is a ""byproduct"" focused mainly on OLAP, books that are fascinated by MDX ""tricks"" and then books that present MDX in its context.Of the last category this is the best book I came across, it is for people who want to understand MDX not just get a feeling of it.From the book it is quite obvious that the authors are proficient in MDX teaching.If it was enhanced by exercises/questions this could become the foundation book for college MDX classes."
3,Issues with samples,"My biggest problem is that I am unable to execute most of the samples because of the ""dimension contains more than one hierarchy, therefore the hierarchy must be explicitly specified"" issue - a behavior change in SSAS 2005. Very frustrating. Are there any corrected samples available for download anywhere?"
3,Not Good If You're New to MDX,"I think that this book is probably not for the beginning MDX developer. I am having trouble getting the examples to work, perhaps because the full text of the example is normally not in the book. I'm not seeing where I can download the examples from the book's website. Additonally, the examples often don't match the strucure of the database that is available from the website. If the database matched the examples, and if the full code of the examples was available on the website it would go a long way to making the book a better buy."
4,MDX Solutions: With Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services 2005 and Hyperion Essbase 2nd Edition,"Information in the book was very good despite the bad grammar usage in several places. This made it difficult to follow at times, but this was the exception instead of the rule. Content was very helpful and almost all of it also applies to SQL Server 2008. Definitely not a beginners level book but medium to expert level users will find it quite helpful. This book was extremely helpful in improving my understanding of MDX."
3,"18"" adjustable wrench","the wrench works well and holds onto items better than I expected.The Wrench looks good and works well.Price is right!unfortunately, ""made in China""."
2,so so,it is good for sensitive skin. you don't get any irritation. but since it is like that it also weak. i should have figured that out. so you don't get all the hair off. but i think it will be good if you have fine hair or just need a little hair off. you can also probably use it for maintenance to keep back stubble. that's what i'll probably do. it is not for a major hair removal.
1,Bad product,Not very good at removing hair compared to other products. Must use large amount and repeat several times. Not worth it.
4,Good work!,"Interesting writer, lonely figure extremly penetrating intelligence; seems he wrote beforehand for the 60's generation. Being an intellectual during the fascist era in Italy unfortunately he was dragged into writing some political pamphlets which reflect nothing of his real cultural work. A necessary tax for survival and possibility to pass on to us His works! His cultural insight is a must for those of us who want to help getting out and above the quagmire of these last day's of the Modern Era. E.A."
1,Evola the fascist,"The fact remains that Evola was a fascist, and that books like this propogate an individualistic egoistic and anti-democratic view of the world. Evola was rather like a lost child on his first day at school, unable to focus on anything but his own sense of alienation to his surroundings. He may have been a genius, but so were Himmler and other such upstanding characters. Those who ignore this side of Evola's character have been seduced by his skill with words. Shoutking would not like the right to write his pompous reviews taken away from him, but if people had listened too carefully to Evola this could have happened."
1,Inane ramblings of a frustrated social conservative,"Evola proposes that modern man's spiritual alienation is a result of civilization's abandonment of 'tradition,' IE heirarchy, sexual specialization, and distribution of power by classification based on primitive, non-scientific folk taxonomy. In fact, like Spencer and Huxley, Evola was a frustrated conservative who tried to explain his personal disgust with post-Enlightenment thought, liberalism and egalitarianism in an intellectual, logical light. His defense of the righteousness of privilege and social stratification fails, as intellectual history continues to prove. You might as well listen to Rush Limbaugh for a more coherent critique of the modern world and it's popular social 'values.'"
5,"Good cologne, great price","My husband has used this cologne for nearly a half century. He loves it (and I don't mind it, unlike most of his cologne). This is a huge bottle of 4711 at an incredible price."
3,not too perfect,I've got same size same brand same battle at Loehmans for 14.55$ and it is very good price and I dont know why is so expencive here!!!
2,they changed the recipe,"I owned a bottle of this for a long long time. You splash it on and it was not overpowering. I did recently buy a new bottle (after running out). I noticed that the ingredients listed are not the same. The old bottle said ""water, alcohol, fragrance"" , the new bottle listed several other additives. I feel that the scent lasts longer now, but can be suffocating. I will not buy this again."
2,4711 Eau De Cologne is old and scent is almost nonexistent,The price was very good but the cologne scent is barely there. I have purchased 4711 for my husband for 20 years and I do know what 4711 smells like and this is not it
1,"the content seems not OK, and smells weird. I was very disapointed","the content seems not OK, and smells weird. I was very disapointed. I'm a current customer of the same product for many years, so I know very well that's a false product.4711 By Muelhens For Men. Eau De Cologne Splash 27 Oz."
4,Mmmm...,"From the mountains of Germany comes the original Cologne...and award winner, and deservingly so, IMO. It's my staple fragrance, and thankfully, my wife approves! Sometimes sweet, sometimes tangy, always appropriate...enjoy!"
1,4711 Original Eau De Cologne Review,I have been using this Cologne for years and it is still my most favorite fragrance and I will continue using this product. Thanks for continuing to carry this product.
5,a classic smell,The smell of 4711 I can remember as a kid. My father wore it for years. The smell is clean and fresh. It does not last long however. It is one of the few scents made in Germany.
5,IT JUST WORKS,I dont know what the other reviews are about but wow this thing was simple to install and just works enough said.
3,decent,do not like how the positive input is the same as output. it looks clean and charged up fast. only about a 30% noticeable difference in lag. you pay for what you get.
5,Great Capacitor,"This capacitor worked great with my Rockford Fosgate Punch Amp (200 RMS x 2) & Stage 2 Subs. It fixed the light-flickering problem in my car and you could feel, as well as hear the difference in the hard-hitting bass that came out of the subs! Would recommend for single sub up to 1000W RMS or twin subs up to 500W RMS.Install was easy and it looks great. Digital read-out lets you know at all times that it was working well and with enough juice to crank up the volume, even to uncomfortable levels."
5,Sweet cap!,"Design is simple and nice, came with a hex key for the bolts, which are long enough to stack say 2-4 reasonably thick lugs on. I had to shave down my lugs because they were like .25"" wide, but that's unusual. Size is good, little clear cap over the voltage circuit is nice. I peeled the stupid 'Raptor' skin off the thing, looks cleaner without that on there! The voltage detection/display circuit is sweet: Basically it stays off (to not drain battery) until it senses a change in voltage, say up/down .1VDC. At that point the display turns on to notify you of the variance. The display is red, with a blue led that flashes when the voltage fluctuates. For example, when I flip my headlights on it will 'wake up'. Same with big bass hits. You should see ~14VDC while the car is on, may fluctuate with current consumption."
4,raptor one farad capacitor,"I am happy with this raptor capacitor. It supplies my car amplifier with all the voltage that it needs and does protect the battery, alternator and car wiring. It buffers the electrical system in my old car so that when I crank up the volume on the stereo system I'm using the capacitor instead of a direct amplifier to battery drain. I think it was $32.00 & worth every penny."
2,rush job,"Woodworth whitewashes Sherman's and Grant's poor performances, and dismisses Hooker's attack on Bragg's left on Missionary Ridge with 6 lines. Woodworth has probably never visited the battle site, and certainly did not make use of the Stewart's Division's reports, at the time of his writing available in the Broadfoot Supplements. He also could have profited from a more careful reading of the two most recent serious books on the battle by Cozzens and Sword."
5,Best vision formula on the market.....hands down winner!!!,"This eye health vision formula is really amazing. I have been using this for about 5 years, and it is amazing. Has really helped me keep my eyes in great shape and fully functional. Its an expensive formula, however, if you try to buy all the ingredients seperately, you will find this to be a real bargain price. I have not found any vision formula to even come close to what this one offers for the price. If you want to nourish the eyes, you wont find anything better than this in my opinion. This is an amazing product that will benefit your eyes and much much more. highly recommended."
4,Husband Wanted - Fast! by Rebecca Daniels,"Description from the book back cover:It seemed like a good idea ... at the time ... After selflessly offering to be a surrogate mother, Olivia found herself pregnant and alone - just before her strait-laced family's reunion. Wealthy CEO of a security firm, Lucas McCall offered to help her - after all, he never could resist a damsel in distress. With the chemistry sizzling between them it was easy to convince Olivia's family that theirs was a marriage for real! But Lucas seemed as intent on protecting his own heart as he did Olivia ..."
5,Solid cookware,"We use the All-Clad cookware and are very satisfied with it, so much so, we gave a set as a gift."
4,All-Clad Master Chef 2 on sale!,"I finally yield to the temptation of adding one more brand-named cookware to my extensive collection. I was not disappointed at all! This set is made for sautee and omelette.The high steel polish allows for sauces to form faster, the gloss on the vegetables is master-chef quality! The brushed aluminum exterior discourage stains & prints. The only improvement has to be with the handle, how can male chefs hold on to these pots and pans?"
3,Not for the amateur,"You know, I'm not a chef. I'm a mom. I have a baby and I can't spend my time and don't want to spend my time taking care of pots and pans. I want to throw them in the dishwasher. This is not for the mom who doesn't want to stand by her sink taking care of pots when she needs to be nursing, cleaning up toys, giving baths, reading bedtime stories. You get my drift. These weren't for me. I gave them four years. They cook fine, but I can get the results I want from dishwasher safe Rachel Ray pots and I'm buying myself new pots for Christmas to replace these."
1,Not worth the money,"I spend more time cleaning the frying pans than cooking. I can cook an egg perfectly; egg not sticking to the frying pans. But when it comes to cooking meat, the frying pans burn so easily."
3,All-Clad,I did not realize you made two different All-Clad (metal) pots. This was more alluminum and the cleaning lady put it in the diswasher and it turned a dark color. Not the usual good all stainless that I had expected.
1,Limited Lifetime Warranty - VERY Limited,"I would never purchase this cookware again. I own approximately 15 pieces of All Clad and while some have held up okay, others have been extremely disappointing. I contacted the company and was treated very rudely.The ""limited"" lifetime warranty seems to be brushed off with a ""you either washed improperly or cooked improperly"" Really? There is no need in my opinion to pay these prices when there are suitable alternatives and much more friendly customer service."
2,ALUMINUM CLAD,"Be aware that there are several different grades of all-clad cookware. The 'Master Chef 2' series has a stainless steel interior and handles, but a brushed aluminum exterior. More expensive all-clad pots and pans have a stainless steel exterior. These pots cannot be washed in the dishwasher, if you do the aluminum exterior oxidizes and is rather unattractive. My mistake for not reading the description thoroughly, the information is there. Why All Clad makes pans with aluminum exteriors, is beyond me. Spend the extra money and get the stainless interior and exterior."
5,Perfect Set,"The set includes all the best basic necessary cookware to get you really immersed in the kitchen. MC2 is amazing because it is stripped to the essentials, only to function the best. I love the brushed aluminum exterior and i love the wear and scratches because it shows me how much i am using these pieces.I immediately noticed how good the heat transfer is, how well the high temp dishes come out and how easily they clean up.These are a huge step ahead of my Calphalon pots & pans.Highly recommended."
2,Kinda lame,"First off the story is confusing, you start the game as the Marked One and that's about all the information you receive. You basically start running around following the arrow on your map, people speak to you in Russian while you read what they say from a prompt if they have anything useful to say. The graphics are decent but that's about it. Aiming is cumbersome to say the least, if you want to zoom in your gun takes up the bottom part of the screen and makes aiming useless. Picking up items is annoying with having to Take All and drag and drop any unwanted items or you can drag and drop each single item. The maps & tasks window is also somewhat confusing. It's just not time well spent, you would be much better off picking up Fallout 3 or any number of FPS games instead."
2,Bugs ruin this game. Wait for more updates,A potentially fantastic game ruined by a too early release.If you buy this game you will be paying to be a Beta Tester.I've installed two updates and it still has serious problems.
3,Shadow review,"Game received in good shape. Not getting into the game too well, Some stuff not working , like gun sights ect. Very confusing as what to do...Display info confusing as well.. Operation manual not much help.."
2,Gives Me Motion Sickness,"I don't know about others, but my head doesn't rock side to side when I walk.Guess the games character must have a wooden neck and a bum leg.Trying to play this game gives me motion sickness big time."
3,save your money,This game has very good graphics and detail with weather patterns. But that is all that is good about the game. A whole lot of reading and not a lot of action.
2,Wait for the patch!,"Save your money on this game until the patch, as it will most likely be a doozy of a file!The Good - Beautiful, immersive game (what I could make work), looks to be the FPS to give Half-Life a run for its money.The BAD - Well let's see, since it won't restart from quick saves unless I go back to the very beginning and start over, I would say that qualifies!Anyone considering buying this game, read and take heed of the negative reviews as they are primarily bug related, and WAIT until the company finishes the bloody thing and patches it properly, then read the user reviews to see if that works before you buy it.$40 is not something most players of FPS games want to throw away on a game that chokes like a cat on a hairball. The developer worked on this beast for six years, they should have taken another six months before releasing it to make this game run properly.My copy gets pitched on the shelf until its patched!"
2,Save your time and avoid this one,"The RPG's I've played this year are (listed order, in other words Mass Effect 2 is the best):Mass Effect 2Fallout New VegasDeus ExJust Cause 2Bio Shock 2Stalker Chernobyl is by far the worst of this list. I found the controls below average, graphics not that great and the overall play labor intensive instead of fun. The most annoying part of the game is how long and difficult it is to get anywhere in the game. It made me wish for the ability to move through the world like you can in Fallout NV. Also the autosave wouldn't work for me. Perhaps I didn't give the game enough time to ""grow"" on me (I think I only put in 5-10 total hours). On the plus side you don't have to use Steam (which I freaking hate)to play/load the game. I'm sure others will disagree with me but for my time and money there are better games to play.My PC specs:AMD Phenom II X4 9658 GB RAMWin 7 home premium (64-Bit)AMD Radeon HD 6870 (1GB GDDR5)"
1,Clunky and Boring,"I'm sorry, but this game left me cold. The interface is difficult to use; you have to constantly leave the game to switch something out or use something. Saving and reloading games after dying (something you do a lot) is cumbersome, and the aiming mechanism for the weapons doesn't seem to work very well. This game so turned me off, I couldn't even get past the second map before simply uninstalling it.Buy a modern FPS, not this dreary, unexciting, go-nowhere game."
3,Kind of slow and very predictable,"For a FPS, its definitely middle of the road. I set it aside after several days of play and had forgot about it until recently. Just not a very exciting game."
4,Steam Did the Trick For Me !,"I have to say i had this game years ago and found it a hassle loading all the patches to get the thing to run decently on my Dual Core Pentium Unit with 3 gigs of ram . Yet having the patch work done , the game still had issues running correctly. But since i have had great success using Steam Games i couldnt pass up the Cheap Offer On Steam to buy the Bundle and run the game again . Well to my suprise ..... This thing runs super smooth now and loaded with a higher graphic card doesnt hurt either . So in any case i can now enjoy the Game where as i didnt before hand with the cd version and a bundle of patches ...I deeply recommend the Steam version for a top notch game ."
2,I dont like it.,"its a primitive game with lame graphics. not what was expected. Thought the game would be fun and modern, buts its lame boring and the graphics look like pixels. lame."
2,"In an era of excellent shooters, it's good not great...if it works at all.","Broad, open-ended gameplay in pretty cool realistic environments. The exact opposite of shooters like Call of Duty which very tightly channel you through specific environments, it's almost MMO-like in scale. Really wanted to like this one, but it's a mess. Needs another 6-10 months of QA and bug fixes to get it working properly. Support is minimal at best, so if it doesn't run on your particular configuration (my quadcore with 8800gts and gigaram is no slouch) then you're going to have to live with graphics glitches that make it almost unplayable and crashes that don't just dump you to desktop but lock your machine requiring hard restart. It's been almost a year after release now, and these unacceptable problems persist despite patches being released. Oh, and patches appear to render your save games unusable, so patch before playing."
1,Six years apparently wasn't enough.,"There's really no excuse for releasing a game with this many bugs. My computer by far meets the system requirements, yet when I save or quicksave, the game crashes to the desktop. Also, the keymapping does not save when I exit the game and I have to reassign all my keys every time I try to play.I mean, the first patch, released mere hours after the retail release contained 64 bug-fixes. Among these fixes is the wondrful fact that when I try to save my game, the game now takes about twice as long to finish crashing. Don't misunderstand me. The game still begins crashing as soon as I hit save, it just takes twice as long for the program to finally die and for my computer to return to a working state.I'll leave the part ebout how my bullets don't seem to hurt my enemies to someone whose computer doesn't spaz over something as simple as saving their game."
2,Meh its an ok game,"Deployed to Iraq, and i borrowed a international version of the game. i liked the game play and figured i'd go ahead and buy my own copy of the US version. Removed the old game completely and installed this version, plus all the patches. Game is now laggy and unstable, it will crash to desktop. No amount of tweaking will fix this issue. I'm running it on a tricked out Alienware M9700 with XP operating system so its not my computer its the game. Personaly i don't think it likes my SLI graphics. Oh well the box is good for covering my noodles in a cup till they are ready, and the disk makes a stylish coster for my beverage while i play Oblivion at max rez."
3,Could be much better,"My biggest grip is the graphics. I had to run on low setting to get game to run smooth, Yet I have dual video cards in SLI and 2GB of memory. Graphics are similar to Soldier of Fortune series which is old. If not for this I would have rated higher. I haven't finished the game yet but so far story is not to bad and as stated is different depending on what you do. One nice aspect is the AI are not repetitive in that when you restart they are not all in the same place every time. I also feel you should be able to carry more weight like about 75Lbs and am looking for a way to change it in the .ini files maybe."
3,well for an older game it was quite fun,"im a bit confused about this game,its a 2007 game but the graphics seem much older,also it played very well on my laptop which is not a high end model..but when i installed it on my sli crossfire gaming machine all hell broke loose..computer froze up solid..had to manually turn it off..then the cpu and case fans started winding out at maximum speed..i had to go back to a previous restore point to get the fans back to normal..wierd huh??and yet it played flawlessly on my Hp g7 series which could never ever compare to my gaming desktop..its running over 1000 watts of power using twin geforce 8800 gtx sli crossfire with 130 watt extreme quad core cpu and 8 GB of quad reapers..so what gives? but it was fun playing on my laptop i guess..if you really want to play a truly unbelievably awesome game, play""Rage,the anarchy edition"" it will blow your mind!"
3,Slow paced and pretty,"Nice looking game but the pacing at the beginning is painfully slow. Eventually it's worth the wait, but I'm not sure I would always be able to stick with it until the pace picked up. Just had a lot of free time that particular weekend."
1,No...just....No,"6 years was not enough. I can't play this for more that 10 minutes because it likes to crash for no reason. For the amount of time this was in develpment, that kind of thing is unforgivable. The graphics and the environment are nice, but it's hard to enjoy them when the game can't be played. Plus the AI is dirt stupid. I put three bullets in a guy before he finally decided to turn and shoot at me. Shame on you THQ Shame on you. Next time, release a game when it's ready."
1,Trojan included on the install disc?,"I got this game as a gift from my girlfriend, and it is the first game installed on the INCREDIBLE rig I just set up yesterday. Windows Vista pops up and warns me I am installing a Trojan agent directly from the dvd executable file. What the hell? Now I'm afraid to run it. I mean... what the hell?"
2,"the AI enemy guns have better range, the game needs patched or mod to fix","couple things make this game unjoyablei like the world of chernobyl , worth the price of the game, but its not like other fps, its anoying that they could fix this stuff if the company would release patch to fix the hit detection of the weapons...the AI weapons are longer range and take less bullets to kill you, you forced to fire sevel shoots to the head close range, forget about the sniper rifles they are dum, takes too many shots to kill , i scoped a head shot and enemy AI has a crap pistal and killed me hundred feet away wtf?"
2,Not much to look at.,I bought this game extremly disscounted from a local vendor. I found the graphics lacking. I should have watched the review on G4 before purchasing. I agree with the G4 review 100%.
2,Not exactly what I was expecting,This game its terrible(to me)I was looking for a shooter lots of actions and graphics but I'm very disappointed. The plot its weak and the mission based tactic its very boring.
4,"Tarkovsky's Stalker becomes a video game, who knew ?","This is based on the masterpiece of a movie called ""Stalker"" by Andrei Tarkovsky. You can find it here on AmazonStalker: A Film by Andrei Tarkovsky. In the movie, the Zone is an area where aliens have landed and a scientist and a writer desperately want to reach its cener through the guidance of a stalker (a guide). Suposedly, at the center of the Zone there is a room where if you are able enough to survive, can fulfill all your wishes. Very philosophical but in typical Tarkovsky style it is slow and cumbersome.Many things in the game reminded me of the movie, like the anomalies and the fact that Stalker uses bolts as his guidance. I recommend it to all funs of the game."
2,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shawdow of Chernobyl,This would be a 5 STAR game if the screen would quit freezing up for 1 to 10 seconds after about 10 to 20 minutes df play
4,A bit confusing...,"This game is extremely fun once you get down to it. With that being said, I ended up getting (what i presume) too far into the game without knowing, thinking the objective finder worked like Fallout 3's. Anyways after playing for hours I finally discovered how to navigate correctly. The game was very fun when I had no idea where to go, besides following the objective arrow. Now that I can navigate on my own, this game has gotten better and better. One of the best games I've played in a while"
1,WORST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED,"This is an FPS with some of the worst programming I have ever seen. The controls are similar to most FPS games but have slight difference, which is extremely awkward for the hand, and you cannot reprogram the keys. A HUGE problem is that if you are too far from the enemies (like 20+ ft away), your bullets do not harm the enemies. Your crosshair still flashes red when over an enemy, but your weapons remain useless. Another flaw is that in some instances, the text stretches outside the dialogue box. It's pathetic. Horrible game. I quit playing less than 2 hours into it."
2,Lacks science,"Although this book has very good advice about the raw vegan diet and yoga in general, it makes claims that are scientifically unsubstantiated. There is NO evidence that drinking tea is not healthy, the research shows that it IS high in antioxidants. I attempted to look up some of Mr Busch's claims in the nutritional literature and could find anything to back them up. I also don't like the fact that it promotes E3 live, a nutritional product which is not approved by the FDA. This book promotes the author's personal agenda ather than solid science- based nurtitional knowledge."
4,Holy cruelty,"On one's first encounter with Lautremont's ""Maldoror"", it will appear a virtually formless, incoherent and incompetent work -- ""a compilation of a sick mind"" -- until, that is, one becomes habituated to its style. Hailed as one of the pioneering works of surrealism, this is undoubtedly one of the most original and explosive meditations on pure evil. Lautremont's glorification of crime and murder, his blasphemy, his rhapsodic celebration of revolt, are, without a doubt, unsurpassed. Never has a book more malignantly oozed more evil, misanthropy and menace. It will jar any so-called ""decent"" person out of his/her comfortably smug composure."
5,Puts the ahhhh in dada....,"You should own this book...and you should buy it right now if you don't own it.Lautremont's epic prose poem dedicated to the subject of evil is probably one of the best surrealist works we've been lucky enough to have bestowed on us. It jumps all over the map, but it never once loses steam or sags under the weight of its subject matter. This is actually the only book I stopped reading halfway through and went back to the beginning so I could underline all the good parts. And there are a LOT of good parts. Even if you could give a whit about evil, you must sit in awe of the pure grace and strength of Lautremont's writing. It's like a pie made from the flesh of angels.So dig in."
3,Put me to sleep,"Certainly Maldoror is unique--I've never read anything like it before and I doubt that I ever will again. Lautreamont's genius is apparent throughout the book, on every page, in nearly every sentence. That said I've never felt so indifferently towards a book that impressed me so. Truth be told, Maldoror put me to sleep on several occasions. (Perhaps it was the translation?)Maldoror lacks the humour of, say, A Season In Hell or Gerard de Nerval's poetry. It's difficult to read despite its dark and fantastic subject matter. Occasionally Maldoror is flat-out boring, although it's unfailingly brilliant. (Believe me when I write that I have NEVER had this reaction before!) Brilliant doesn't always translate to likeable, I guess.The shorter piece of writing in the book, Poesies, is highly amusing. Overall I rate the collection three stars because it just didn't do it for me. I recommend Selected Writings by Gerard de Nerval instead of Maldoror."
2,Wooden Magazine Table,"We have had this table for about a year. I would NOT buy another one. Every few months I have had to push the table's bottom pieces back into position. Also, the top has a wooden photographic (fake) appearance. We bought it because of its useful design for setting between two chairs (for magazines, a lamp and a place to set morning coffee)."
4,Hmmm........,"This was a fairly good book. Do not be mis-leaded to think this is like the Animorph series. It is totally different.There was only 2 things I didn't like about this book. #1: It didn't have nearly as much detail as you would expect. #2: After you read this book you get a... very strange feeling. Its hard to explain. The feeling is half sad half a feeling that you dont belong...anywhere. That there's no tomorrow, that you are of little or no importance. Its creepy."
3,"Good idea, bad execution","It was a good idea. I adore these sort of animal-human transition stories and I naturally picked the book up. At first, I was rather captivated with the good plot. But as I gradually read on, I started getting tired. Her execution was poor. She doesn't resort to much description and although, this may be good in many ways, it didn't suit this type of book. She is brief, touches merely the surface and cannot bring the reader into the story. It would have been much better if the relationship between tess and kevin had been better explored and more elaboration given to the 'switching' process itself.Quite mediocre: 3 stars"
4,A Real Children's Classic,"Switchers and its two sequels (Midnight's Choice and Wild Blood) add to the canon of true literary children's classics. Kate Thompson combines touching psychological insight into Tess's troubled, lonely heart and vivid imaginings about the minds of animals with a thrilling plot about world weather catastrophe and a great friendship between Tess and the mysterious Kevin; there's also plenty of humour (the rats are fab). The moments when Tess first ""switches"" and Kevin makes his Big Choice at the end made me gasp - as you can see, I loved this book! However, Switchers suffers slightly by being first: there's too much narration about what Tess is thinking and not enough description, dialogue and action sequences. But don't be put off by this one complaint about technique; the writing just gets better and better through the series. This is a fabulous adventure story about being brave enough to care about the world, to reach out and make friends, to change who you are."
3,The Great Switch...Switchers,"Switchers is all about ""Switching"" from one physical form into another. One starts out with a girl named Tess who has this ability. She is always by herself and plays with other animals. Eventually she meets up with a mysterious boy named Kevin who later reveals his true self to Tess. The adventure soon continues via the form of a rat. The end of the book has many surprises. The story had a great idea, a lot like animorphs, but lacked that adventure. Just as soon as the kids realize what they have the potential for, the story ends. It was a decent book, but just ends to abrupt."
5,NBA Live 2000 Rules,"Well, EA Sports has done it again with a great basketball game in NBA live 2000. It has great gameplay, graphics, and user control. There are many new options from 99, and there is a great online connection. I bought this game about a month ago, and i still playit everyday. This is amust have for all EA Sports Gamers"
4,I Love this Game! ...,"I haven't bought an NBA EA Sports game for a couple of years now and was blown away by this game. The graphics engine is awesome, down to the detailed crowd animation. I like it when the crowd gets into it as your game gets more and more exciting. However, the crowd still does not go berserk if you win a thriller at the end. And EA Sports, how about adding those crowd waving ""foam distractions"" when players are taking free throws?The inclusion of the Jordan feature is a true bonus and the ability to play historic teams is engaging. However, the game gets really easy real quick. You can put up a boat load of points with any team (think Clippers and Bulls) even in their current incarnations.But still fun!"
3,Black lychee,This is a good tea BUt not as aromatic as I have had with other black Lychee teas. It's the first time I bought this brand and will try others before I return to this. The packaging etc was very good and kept the tea fresh..
2,doesn't taste like lychee tea,"I got this from a Chinese grocery store after having lychee tea at a Cantonese restaurant and loving it. This tastes nothing like the tea I had, which had a sweet smell and a definite lychee flavor. This is black tea with some other taste in it, but does not taste like lychee."
1,No Flavor!,"After having REAL Lichee tea in a California Chinese restaurant, I found that FooJoy Lichee tea is all but flavorless! I would not recommend it to anyone!"
5,I LOVE IT,"I have recently gotten one for Christmas, and it took me a very short time to get used to it, and it's functions.My pc does not have windows XP or fireware so the cd included with the iPod couldn't be used, but I registered it on my sisters pc which does, I had to download iTunes of a free disc I got at CompUsa, but I guess you can get it off the internet easily.It's quite amazing being albe to walk on the street and listen to music that I was only able to hear on my computer, Im so happy I have this, no more cd players and carrying bulky objects, this slim baby rocks!Its so easy to use and enjoy, I think everyone should get one!"
5,Awesome Product,The Apple iPod is definitely the best mp3 player out there. The 10GB model is enough space for almost anyone to fit an entire music collection. It is also amzingly easy to use. I have a Windows PC and it even works with my computer. Don't listen to people who say you need an Apple Computer to make it work and also don't listen to people who say you need to have a firewire port installed in you Windows PC. If you buy the USB connector cord (www.apple.com) it syncs very quickly through USB on a Windows PC. Definitely a great product for all music lovers.
2,Not for Running!,"I am buying the Rio Cali 256 Sport to replace my iPod. I've had the iPod for 1 year and bought it specifically for long runs. It's great for storing songs and for non-impact activities, but it is NOT for running!My iPod started to freeze up while running, so I went to the Apple store for help. (The freeze-up only happened while I was running. It was OK otherwise.) I was told to restore the iPod to factory settings. That did not work, so I went back to the help desk. The second time, the tech person told me that running with the iPod was like running ""with a hard drive strapped to your belt"" and that it was not good to run with it. I am a tried and true Mac person, but I would not recommend this MP3 for active sports."
2,"Note: 35/178 reviews, 2 stars or lower, Hmmmm","I suppose I could add my horror story. But maybe it is more important to note:35 out of 178 Amazon customer/reviewers give the ipod a rating of 2 stars or less. Reliability problems, customer service problems, PC-compatability problems.Think maybe Apple has a problem?I shoulda looked here more carefully first!"
5,da bomb,It is great for windows alot of songs and amazing sound quality. It is so sleek and cool and is worth every cent.
1,DO NOT BUY * BE CAREFUL*,Apple just made a 15 gig ipod for the same price as the 10 gig. Do not buy the 10 gig Ipod because it is being discontinued. 15 gig is now the lowest model. look for yourself at apple.com
1,Some Issues (Windows iPod),"Yes, it looks cool and has a simple interface.However, try to use it as an alarm clock and thealarm beep for about 3 seconds! Useless.Before I go there, let me say that the 10 GB iPod Ihave comes with a Firewire cable. Most computers don'thave the Firewire port anymore, they have USB ports. It isfrustrating to see Apple use such cheap tricks, had to goto the store to get a $20 Firewire-USB cable.I finally have the thing hooked up to my computer, butthe MusicMatch software is non-intuitive. 2 h and I stillhaven't been able to download a song to the thing, let aloneorganize any music. (and yes, I AM computer savvy).The main reason I got this, alongwith the iTrip (fromGriffin tech), is to use it in my car. I want to tunethe iTrip to my car FM so that I don't have to fiddlewith my CDs in my car. I haven't received the iTrip yet,so lets see how that (mis)adventure goes."
2,helpful hints,The Ipod is great it holds alot of songs. If you like to run outside ever or be in the cold in Minnesota the Ipod gets too cold and it will turn off and becomes completely useless. You need to make sure your computer has the the proper version of windows operating system inorder to set up this fire wire card which costs about $50 dollars extra. It crashed my computer and took me a week to get it all back together. If you like to listen to music inside and not in the cold and you have a computer with some newer operating system you shouldn't have a problem and you can listen to really good sound quality. The other problems suck though.
1,Don't buy an iPod.,"If you're thinking of buying an iPod, i suggest you check out a site called http://www.ipodsdirtysecret.com/The truth: the iPods' irreplaceable battery only lasts 18 months. It costs almost the same to have it replaced as it would to buy another iPod.Why isn't ""no stars"" an option?"
3,"Very nice piece of equipment, but not perfect","I have an Apple imac, so I am not having the problems that PC users are having. The unit is nice and small, but my biggest complaints are 1) accessories are expensive for apple products 2) I'm annoyed by their free engraving offer which apparently keeps people from being able to return or exchange their ipods (I, fortunately, didn't not have mine engraved). 3) itunes will not allow you to pull songs from your ipod and put them on your hard drive. This is easily avoided however with software that can be found online. Of course, you have to purchase the software. In summary, it's a nice unit, but I question some of Apple's decisions."
2,doesn't work well,"its great in theory, holds tons of song and is slim and pretty. But it doesn't work at all. on my computer I spent days trying to get it to work but it keeps freezing,"
1,Apple Uses Deceptive Sales Practice to Reduce Returns,"Do NOT personalize your IPod with an engraving, which Apple is offering for ""free."" If you do this, you will NOT be able to return your IPod for ANY reason. This detail is burried in the fine print found in ""Other Terms and Conditions."" This is a deceptive sales practive. The right to return a product is one of the hallmarks of responsible retailing.This warning is in addition to the many caveats regarding the IPod's inferior battery. Many users have found out the hard way that the ""memory effect"" degrades the battery in the IPod over time. You will have to replace it. Initially, Apple was charging $269 for the repair but they are succumbing to consumer pressure (and class action lawsuits) and offering a $99 replacement program."
4,Good MP3,"This is a great MP3 player, but th packaging should include more. I own an Emachines computer with two High-Speed USB ports. To connect the iPod, I had to go out and buy the Docking Station also. I would recommend buying this, but make sure that you also buy the Docking Station if you plan to connect it to a PC."
3,sucks but i'm sure its great,i would be able to post a review but my ipod didnt come with a usb cable . tell me this is not screwed up. on the box it clearly says win or mac . i would asume most win users are using a pc and pc owners rarely have firewire adapters becuase usb is so freakin popular. ... i wonder how many poeple share my thoughts on this christmas morning
1,not ready for windows,"to put it plainly the software isnt ready for windows it is INCOMPATBLE if you dont beileve me go to the apple website and look at the discussion board for the windows ipod, there are hundreds of complaints about the itunes software not reading the ipod or even a the cdrom drive. It turns out if you have an anti virus program itunes will not work. if you cd rom is sony or samsung to name a few itunes will not read it makin it impossible to load music on your ipod. After spending about 20 hours despreatly trying to manipulate itunes to play a cd customer service just told me to take it back. so tommorow its going back and im going to check the dell dj"
1,"You're a mean one, Mr. Jobs","Few things can compare to the magic of Christmas morning. And I was thrilled to find under the tree the iPod I've been covetting for so long. At last - an end to my dreary, music-less commute. Goodbye, crazy subway patrons; Hello, the sweet sounds of digital music!So you can imagine how incredibly shocked and angry I was when I learned that I can't actually hook this thing up to either of my less-than-one-year-old PCs until I purchase some $20 cable that - incredibly - is not included in Apple's slick, styled $300 package.Why in the world would they sell this device without the basic equipment required to hook it up to a computer??What a complete disappointment. The folks at Apple should be ashamed of themselves."
2,What's with the sound quality on the IPOD,"For such a cool new gadget I must say that the sound quality sure is not really that impressive. When transfering CD from the PC to the IPOD it seems like quality is lost, as well as the music playing slower in the Ipod. With the Monster cables that hooks the Ipod up to a stereo, even more sound quality is lost, so I regret even buying those. This is still a great little gadget, but more a toy than a serious quality music machine, so if you are looking for sound to equal youd CD player at home you may be disappointed."
3,y get the ipod,it is too expensive y get it when the dell is $224 for 15gb. It is 1 of the best there has to be. It is easy to use when u read the booklet. I totally recomend it. Just go on to dell.com.
2,"Pretty, but horribly designed","The Ipod is sleek and modern looking. Appears to be excellently designed. But, it's not. The controls are pressure designed and they are awful. The return-to-the-beginning button is placed too closely to the other buttons, so it is too easy to accidentally press the button and return to the beginning (for example, the beginning of a book if you listen to recorded books). All buttons are pressure-sensitive, but the pressure does not always work. For example, you can try to turn the machine off, but pressing on the button sometimes functions normally and at other times you can press the button for minutes, with no response.Do I have a lemon? No. I know others who have the identical machine and experience identical problems.This machine is a dud. It needs major changes in functional design.I recommend against buying the machine."
5,Amazing,"Quite simply the most amazing blend of form, function and style of anything I have ever seen or held in my hand. Remakable product. Intuitive. Worth the price."
1,don't waste your $ or time!!,"It is now January 3 and I have devoted days of my christmas vacation attempting to get my son's christmas gift to work- if it was not the poor kid's ""big gift"", I would have given up days ago. I have never been as frustrated, I have never written a review. My guess is, you need an apple- I have two brand new dells and the IPOD really didn't work on either. The software that PC users use (jukebox) is also not great- I have now paid for an update of that and I won't use it- I am down at least $375 and countless hours!!"
1,Awful for PC users,"This is the worst christmas present I have received. I am STILL waiting for my connector cord to see if my PC will even recognize the thing.I have stored all my music in the itunes and foolishly downloaded some music, which I cannot burn onto the disc, a common problem for PC users.I'm happy for the PC users that haven't had problems, but I would seriously recommend anyone with a PC to try anything but apple.Support from Apple website, a week ago I sent an e-mail, still waiting for a reply.I've spent hours searching on the ipod website trying to find a solution, to no avail.Too late to return it, will probably give it to someone I like who has a MAC or someone I hate who has a PC."
5,Best Christmas Present Ever!,"This thing rocks - and it works on Microsoft Windows PCs, I have XP Home Edition, and the thing hooked right up (old reviews that mentions it doesn't work with PCs are out-of-date, Apple launched their Windows edition of iPod software and it runs great).Gosh, Christmas is over - but if you want to get a little something for yourself post holidays, or maybe for that special someone's birthday, this is the one to get.Oh, and I got the 10 GB iPod, it's slimmer and it holds up to 250 CDs, well enough for most music fans."
3,"Once it dies, you're out of luck.","Apple's iPods are really wonderful, amazing machines while they are working. They are also wonderful while they are under warranty. However, once they are past warranty, if the machine permanently freezes, or just dies and won't come back to life despite your having tried all the fixes given on Apple's support page, there's not much you can do. Apple does offer a mail-in repair service, but the flat fee for repairs is nearly the price of a new 10 GB iPod -- more than $255.00. A scam if I've ever heard of one. I knew I shouldn't have bought the thing!"
3,Beware PC Users,Just to let you know if you are a PC user make sure you by the dock for the ipod. When I did the research for this product I never found anything that said I had to buy additional hardware in order for the Ipod to work with my computer. I didn't find this out until I recieved the ipod in the mail and found out that it wasn't worth the effort to buy the extra equipment. So if you really want this product just make sure that you buy the dock and the usb cable if you have a pc. It costs an extra 50 bucks so if you think that it is worth it go ahead.
5,Apple ROCKS!,"And this product proves it once again that everyone should support this great company! I love my iPod. I use it in the car, to work out, at home, at work...everywhere. It's so easy to use and is just about the coolest electronics thingie out there. Luckily, I'm a Mac user and don't have all of the problems worrying about cards for Firewire and USB. Windows machines are such a pain."
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDIN ME!!,"CHRISTMAS 2003 AM, MY SON GETS AN IPOD FOR CHRISTMAS...REALLY EXCITED. NOW, I HAVE A NEW COMPUTER, NO FIREWIRE PORT(COME ON) AND A KID WHO CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY SONGS UNTIL I CAN GET TO THE STORE TO BUY ALL THE OTHER PARTS I NEED TO MAKE THIS THING WORK. OK, NOT THAT $299.00 PLUS SHIPPING WASN'T ENOUGH. I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT AN APPLE PRODUCT BEFORE, AND AFTER ALL THIS AGGRAVATION, I NEVER WILL AGAIN. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,iPod is not good.,"The iPod is OK (3 stars) but Apple has terrible support and customer service especially for iPods and more especially for Windows-based iPods. An example-Apple is deleting suggestions/complaints for iPods from its discussion boards. Further, the iPod has many formidable competitors (cheaper and better or similar features, size, and style) coming out including the Philips HDD100."
1,wait to buy this,"Apple just announced that they are stopping production of this model, and going to offer the 15 GB model for the same price"
2,"GOOD IPOD, BAD PROTECTION","I have to admit, this iPod is awsome. It holds plenty of songs,and its an all out good mp3 player, and i wood sugesst getting it.DONT LISTEN TO ALL THE PEOPLEWHO SAY THE SOFTWEAR DOSENT WORK, i have a hp pavilion pc, and windows XP home addition,, and it works excellent. but my only critisism, is that the ipod itslef gets scrached up very much, ive had it for a couple months and the back is very scrached. if you plan to get this, buy some sort of a cover, but DO NOT GET AN ISKIN EXO, they are terrible. anymore questions about the softwear of anything, please feel free to contact me, at YourName56765@aol.com, NOT mastergreg56765yahoo.com"
3,"Looks Great, Less Filling","I really, really wanted to love this product and I still do but more like you love your cat instead of your dog. 10 gig of space for music is fantastic and I have yet to fill it without going into my B and C list of songs. I encountered problems right away with the battery and after 2 returns, I figured out it was the AC adapter that was frying the battery. Every time I used the firewire, all was well but as soon as I used the AC to charge, it no longer communicated with my PC. So I can't use my AC anymore to charge. The battery is very temperamental so beware. Also, it's a fragile item. I defy anyone to try and keep it scratch free without putting it behind glass. I tried running with it but the jarring was just too much and would freeze up on me. It also would be nice to be able to delete songs on the fly. I work within its limitations and still enjoy it."
4,When will I be able to afford this?,"Seriously the only problems with iPod are its price and internal battery. I have been thinking of buying it for more than a year, but can't get myself to spend so much on a mp3 player which will die in 2 yrs time.If Apple had used a user replacable battery or the price was $100 less I would have bought it without a thought. I need only 3GB or atmost 5GB, but cheapest one is 10GB.I am starting an ipod fund to save money for one and will use my 10 buck CD player meanwhile!"
1,user-HOSTILE iPod support for XP!,"WARNING! If you have ANY problem with your iPod after initially installing on a Windows XP box you will be in very deep trouble. Customer support is comfortable with telling you that details explicitly stated as supported in the user manual (access through a proxy, for example) are simply not supported. User support was overtly nasty to me, literally laughing over the phone at me, when the iPod would not connect to a second user (my own actual account as opposed to the administrator account I'd used to set up the iPod/iTunes connection in the first place). They refused to address the problem altogether stating that their support was strictly limited to getting it to work at all, and that it did work as far as they were concerned.I have had several other smaller issues (application not openning up and not closing properly) and there is no support whatsoever and, worse, a snide, condescending attitude from customer support."
3,iTunes for Windows is unstable,I just bought one of these and the iTunes application consistenly crashes my XP system. Hard to know what to do since Apple doesn't provide phone support. I'm in reboot hell and seriously considering returning the product.
2,meh...,"I bought this years and years ago, died within a year of owning it. Battery life was meh at best, sound quality was not very good, and I hated itunes. obviously its an old model, but don't bother regardless. I replaced it with a sony, which had awesome battery life and sound quality, plus was smaller, and still works after 3 years and being dropped and run over by a car, but had abysmal software that killed my old computer. I have a 4gb zune now and love everything about it."
1,very poor windows implementation,"I Have a good 6-8 hours of effort into getting my brand new 15gb windows ipod to just have a playlsit work. The included MusicMatch software for PC is basically totally broken (and this is confirmed by numerous posts on sites like ipodlounge.com). The standard advice is to go buy another program like xplay since the included software from Apple doesn't work. The problem with the third party programs is that most haven't been updated to work with the latest crop of ipods. ... Not sure if this is apple's way of suggesting that everyone buy a mac ..., but if you are a PC users I suggest looking elsewhere. I am very disappointed ...-H"
1,iPod on Windows - Read the fine print,"Well, this will be the last Apple product I buy. Nothing is more frustrating than buying a Christmas present and having it not work. Sure, the box says that the requirements are a Windows PC with USB 2.04. What they fail to tell you is that you have to buy another special cable - one that Amazon doesn't even list and is out-of-stock at other sites. So be prepared to pay another 5 to 10 percent for the right cable (depending on with iPod and the shipping cost). That is IF you can find it in stock. I don't see it listed here on Amazon."
1,iPod is an unreliable piece of junk,"I bought a new iPod and only used it for a few months before the hard drive failed. It is now dead.... I've sent it in for repairs, but I'll probably be on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get it fixed. This is not a relaible device. If you are looking for something to use for active sports like skiing, etc. my advice is to look elsewhere. For the time being, I'm back to using my old Creative Labs Nomad 3, which I've had for years and has held up quite well, unlike my iPod which has failed in an embarassingly short amount of time. Shame on you Steve Jobs!"
4,Used the stove on a week trip to New Mexico mountains,"Stove worked well. The only improvement I would make is to the fold down feet that also hold the top closed when folded up. On less than level ground or a table, the legs fold over easily if the stove tries to slide to one side or the other. It would be nice if you could lock the legs in place when folded down to use the stove."
5,Good performance for the price -- don't forget the matches!,It's an OK stove. Better than my propane indoor one. Good basic unit for camping and two-burner cooking -- but don't forget the matches or portable piezo!
3,70s Blacksploitation at it's most offensive,"Disturbing film delivers shocks and thrills. Goodbye Uncle Tom could not be made today. The racism on display is horrifying to say the least. Seeing church leaders use the bible to justify - no claim slave ownership as a right is very creepy. The portrayal of the period is solid and you come away feeling that an accurate portrayal is given of what it was like in that time. Details of the slave auctions, casual rape and brutality and living conditions should turn the stomache of even the most ardent racist."
2,Goodbye Uncle Tom,Don't waste your time. The front photo is misleading.This is a poorly made film. It does not compare to otherslavery type productions especially about plantation life.The actors are neophytes and foreigners; poor camera presence.
1,You are kidding right,"You must be kidding me, this movie is a Joke...It portrays black men in a negative ignorant light, and it portrays young black women as whores for the white man. It shows the older black woman(like a pimp) giving our young black woman to the slave owner for sexual acts, portraying the black woman as wanting the white man to have her. It does show the white man as being a rapist, murderer, and just plain sick for treating another human being as he did, but this movie is a joke, and it should not be pushed on us as something we can relate too. It is buffoonery at it's worst, at the expense of blacks and our history. This is a horrible film, I learned nothing excecpt someone wants me to think they did blacks from Africa a favor. How can anyone give this movie a good review, it really is a joke, it's rediculous, it has nothing on roots, and should not be compared. It's a parody of slavery."
3,Goodbye Uncle Tom,I found the film interesting. I found some parts of the film really creepy. Especially the scene where the african/slave kids were being sold for who knows what... the kids painted in gold and silver. I also felt that towards the end of the film with the transition to Nat Turner did not make a whole lot of sense. I did not get the connection. It does prompt me to do my own research and find out the significance.
2,waste,"No one can deny the brutality of slavery....and if you have some sick need or desire to witness it, this movie will please you. But whatever lessons can be learned about the brutality of human slavery in THIS movie are completely smothered by the terrible production and acting. This is like witnessing slavery through the eyes of Monty Python. Don't waste your money."
4,Rivetting!,I agree that it must have been quite controversial for it's time.Very thought provoking.I'm curious as to where most of the extra's came from.
5,Goodbye Uncle Tom,"This is a serious and disturbing movie, and also very surreal in its depiction of the life of black slaves in America; its truly a classic. Also, kudos to the shipper for promptly processing and shipping this dvd, as well as for the professional packaging job. I'd easily do business with this shipper again."
3,decent if subpar entry,"This reads like an unedited first draft of a novel. The writing is sloppy and digressionary, fast-paced in spots, agonizingly slow in others. The sitcom-ish situation with Lefler and Calhoun in Si Cwan's quarters is amateurishly stupid, and the ""surprises"" regarding Xyon and Riella could be seen about six miles off (though the former was at least well handled).The book has its moments -- particularly the byplay among Si Cwan, Kebon, and Soleta -- but it should've been a lot better.A disappointing chapter in an enjoyable series."
3,It seems a little off track,"Peter David continues to show his solid grasp of his owncharacters, but this particular installment disappoints. I, for one, shell out the $ for a Trek novel because of familiarity with the characters. The tale of Riella isn't original enough to stand out on its own, so this one's a real let down."
4,Peter's a Party!,"Peter David hasn't disappointed me yet with his New Frontier series. I've been reading the adventures of the Excalibur crew from day one, and this story is certainly a fine addition to my collection. While we do not get to hear much from Mackenzie Calhoun himself, we DO get to fight the good fight with a woman who just might be Si Cwan's sister. Even *better,* we get to see the battle from the Bad Guys' point of view, something I find very entertaining. I only regret the Dogs of War were not pictured on the cover. Though my imagination does them fine justice, it would have been cool to see an artist's rendition of what Peter had in *his* imagination! And if you think this is the end of it, ha. Not hardly. I'm glad I bought #8 already, because I'm cracking it open this afternoon."
3,Little Focus on Excalibur Crew,"I have to admit that although I love Peter David's writing, this book left me a little wanting at the end. The ""Quiet Place"" finale was not all that interesting and I was waiting for more appearances by the rest of the Excalibur crew. I appreciated the focus on Zak, Si Cwan and Soleta, but there should have been less of an emphasis on introducing us to Xyon.The ending was cute and I am definitely getting more of the series."
1,Bad investment,This hose is made from an incredibly cheap plastic. was under the impression that it easily snapped apart in sections which is not the case. It actually broke when trying to install it -- would not recommend
3,Not an Exact Match,"Amazon offered this hose under the buy both recommendation. While individually the VIP50 and this hose are great products, there is a fundamental flaw in the buy together offer by Amazon.The discharge port on the pump is 1 and a 1/4 inches, the hose as offered is 1 and a 1/2 inches. Once i received my purchase, I then discovered I had to treck down to the local home depot to now buy pluming fitting to connect the two pieces together. That was an inconvenience I would have rather done without.Notwithstanding the above, once connected, the unit as a whole works very well."
1,I spoke too soon,"I bought this to fit the pump I purchased from Amazon and this was recommended for this pump... but guess what, this hose doesn't fit the pump.... the pump fixtures all are threaded and this hose will not slide over the threads, nor will it fit any other fixture included with the pump. Amazon should not recommend this hose with the CMT pump since they are not compatible... either the pump people should have one end smooth so this type of hose will slide over it, or these hose folks should have one end threaded to match up with the pump. Now I'm stuck with a hose that won't work with the pump."
1,DOES NOT FIT THE Wayne RUP160,"Amazon grouped these together can when they arrived the hose does not fit the pumpWayne RUP160 1/6-Horsepower 3,000 GPH Oilless Submersible Utility Water PumpNot cool"
1,Discharge hose doesn't fit the pump,This hose was 'bundled' with the Wayne Pump I bought as a compatable hose. However the attachment did not fit the pump. Return was so easy and support from Amazon on the return was excellent.
2,discharge hose,"I bought this because amazon recommended it along with a Wayne sump pump. Much to my dismay, they were NOT compatible!! I had to go buy an adapter to make it work. Beware Amazon recommendations for sump pump discharge hoses!"
3,bought it for use if my back yard floods,but it hasn't flooded yet. so I have yet to use it due to the lack of rain. actual use has not occurred yet.
1,Not compatible with G.T Water WP 25,"Last time I buy from Amazon. They bundled the add on hose with the WP 10 water powered pump and the Wayne pumps discharge hose kit as one product, totally misleading me to think they would work together. NO! The extension hose is too big for the water pump requiring I go look for something else. My fault for not reading the reviews, but with a hurricane barreling down on me in 36 hours, I gambled and lost. Totally mislead by Amazon."
3,"It works, but . . . .","The first thing you'll need is a working hose clamp. The cheap clamp that comes with this item strips-out as soon as you try to tighten it. My hose didn't fit over the pump end so it had to be split to make it fit. Then it had to be taped at the split since the split leaked water and then the clamp had to be clamped into place over the tape. That's the downside. The upside is that the hose doesn't leak and will stand the strain of being laid over a sharp corner without crimping. In summary, the hose works as advertised but you'll need your own clamp and tape to attach it to the pump."
1,Listed as a companion accessory for the Wayne RUP160,"I ordered this discharge hose kit a week ago along with a Wayne 1/6HP utility pump upon noticing this was purchased by other buyers. Upon opening the package I realized that this has a 1 1/2"" NPT male adapter while the RUP160 needs a 1 1/4"" adapter. I ended up buying a universal discharge hose kit from a local hardware store for about the same price which included both adapters. Since the package has been opened I'm not sure if I can return it but am going to try. Save yourself a headache and be sure you buy the correct discharge kit if you buy it here."
2,"Fits, but a bit flimsy","I have bought several of these hoses and they do fit well, but they seem to havea quality control issue. At least two had leaks out of the box, but the ones that did not leak worked well. So, would rate higher if the hose was less flimsy."
3,Shame on you Amazon!,"i purchased a water pump on amazon, and when i did amazon offered this hose to go with it. (with the option ""buy them both""). unfortunately this was NOT the correct size for the water pump we ordered. so, i'm not sure about the quality of this particular hose, since it is not designed for the water pump i purchased, and i was unable to use it."
2,connecting to pump a pain,"bought this to go with a wayne pump. connecting it to pump involved two trips to the local hardware store, wasting my time!! once connected worked fine."
1,the most horrible experience!,"the worst kit ever! it took me one hour to wax my bikini line.very bad stuff, never again!don't buy it. it is a waste of money!"
5,***** A MUST READ ****,"This book is a MUST READ for anyone who wants to know of the negative impacts and threats (with back-up documentation) brought about by the United States' currently broken border, as it pertains to our national security (or lack thereof), economy, strain on our educational and healthcare systems, and crime.As a resident of Arizona and a parent, I am well aware of the increased costs our schools incur to teach non-English-speaking students whose families do not contribute to our tax base. On a daily basis, we see and hear news stories regarding the increased violence and crime (gangs, drugs, and high number of stolen identities) against our society, thereby wreaking havoc on the lives of our legal citizens.Also discussed in the book were the truths beyond the farces (again documented) that have been used to rationalize/justify the non-enforcement of immigration laws that are currently on the books.DEFINITELY WORTH THE READ."
2,Nothing new,"I have read Pat Buchanan's book on the subject and it lays out a better understanding of the immigration and terrorist threatthan this one. This seems to be ""same old"" and scare tactics."
5,Illegal Immigration,"Congressman Hayworth has really hit the nail on the head with this book. He's got a great perspective on our current situation with Illegal Immigration, Border Security and the War on Terror. I recommend it to anyone who wants a common sense way of approaching these problems we face as a nation."
5,Lavender Dusting Powder,"I purchased the Lavender Dusting Powder from Woods of Windsor for several of my niece's as gifts. The shipment was fast. I am very pleased with the powder, it smells absolutely wonderful and comes in a nice size container, perfect for any vanity top. I will definitely be purchasing more powder in the future. I would recommend this product to anyone. I give this an A+ rating!"
5,Wonderful!,I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! The scent is light and refreshing and the powder itself nice and silky.
2,Bought it for Mom,"Mom wanted a dusting powder that didn't smell too strong for her birthday. Bought her this one instead of the rose. I thought it was great, she didn't like the smell. Oh well."
5,Delightful Fragrance,"Difficult to find except through Amazon, this British product is an excellent example of a fine dusting powder, considered old-fashioned in the modern world. It comes in an easy to use size box with powder puff for application. It makes for a pleasing gift for someone who appreciates fine bath products."
1,Poor,John Follain cannot decide if he wants to be dramatic or expository. So he aims for both - in miserable spurts that completely fog the history of this madman and of modern terrorism itself. Rarely are the Jackal's motivation and vision clear. Even muddier is the larger story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the U.S.' growing intervention in Mideast politics and the backlash therein. I knew close to nothing about these issues going into the book and I still don't. I confess I gave up half-way through when I could no longer kid myself into thinking this clumsy book was a serious work of non-fiction.
4,Great low price spectrum analyzer,I have used this unit several times now and have been pleased with the performance. It is not the end all but for the price it gives me the information I need for running live sound.
5,Wagner Saves Thousands of Dollars in Doctor's Bills,"I purchased ""How To Stay Out of the Doctor's Office"" several years ago, and I am convinced the book has saved me thousands of dollars in medical bills. Wagner's book helps you to diagnose common physical ailments, and he gives natural solutions for healing. He gives precise descriptions of problems like kidney stones, gallstones, high blood pressure, cholesterol control, thyroid problems, multiple sclerosis, gout, tinnitis, yeast infections, ulcers, and diabetes. I have read some sections of his book several times, and I am convinced that I have avoided/cured gallstones, kidney stones, gout, and ulcers by following his advice. I highly recommend this book to everyone. (jsoverton@excite.com)"
5,Great History here,"I learned so much, not just about aviation but about the 1900's as well. Great planes, a good story, so much historical footage. Nicely done documentary.We also loved One Six Right and One Six Left - more aviation movies :)"
3,Useful videos of civil aircraft - but with a european bias,"I found this collection of civil aviation videos to be very informative and generally well done. But as an American, I was unpleasantly surprised to find very little coverage of significant aircraft from the States. For example: There was hardly any footage dealing with what most aviation experts consider one of the most significant airliners - the Douglas DC-3. Also missing was Piper, Cessna, etc. (although the collection seemed to gloss over general aviation aircraft in general). Bottom line: well done and interesting, but definitely unevenly non-comprehensive."
2,Revlon Palm Straightener,"Nice size, however, unit does not heat up enough for my type of coarse and wavy hair"
1,outside gets too hot!,"I bought this straightener because I liked the compact size and the control gained from the palm held design. However, Revlon seems to have forgotten thermodynamics and hasn't included enough heat shielding between the hot ceramic plates and your hand. The first time I tried to use the straightener, I nearly burned my hand because the outside was so hot. I got through about three sections of hair before I gave up and decided to return it. Everyone in my family agreed that it was too hot to comfortably handle."
1,Dont buy this straightener,"This was a very cute and compact straightener, but it takes a very long time to heat up. It doesnt get very hot at all, even if you wait a while. If you have ever used a good straightener before, you will not like this one. There was no point in even straightening my hair, because as soon as i went outside it frizzed out and got wavy. My hair is not thick, but can get frizzy, and this straightener did not work for me. I do not reccomend waisting your money on this straightener. Sometimes spending a little bit more is worth it."
4,Elmo Overload,"These DVDs are extremely educational and was a very good buy, however, there is too much Elmo. When I saw the 1969 in brackets, I was expecting actual episodes from that time onwards. You know, with Mr. Hooper and Bob etc. There are too few of these. The old introductory music wasn't there either. It was a kill joy for me who grew up on Sesame Street in the 70s in the Caribbean but all in all it was still an excellent buy because my children absolutley love them and they are the ones who they are really for. I would definitely recommend them to everyone, especially in the UK because they don't show Sesame Street here, only rubbish like Teletubbies where one learns to say, ""Uh oh."" And nothing else. So guys, buy this box set!!"
4,great fun,"like the review by Michelle, this is a great game, great work out and family fun, the only down side is the music, it needed more taiko based songs and there are not alot of songs in it. But if you have two drums, it will be even more fun.also there aren't taiko drum master games out there except this one which is a shame."
4,Kids and Teen love it!,"My kids, including my 16 year old son, go back to this game quite often. They have found it challenging and fun. Would recommend."
5,Coolest game ever!,"I got this game a few days ago,and I can't stop playing it! This was the best game I have ever gotten! The songs are really cool and if you beat them you can unlock more. Kind of exspensive but it's really worth it. I have a blister on my hand from playing so much! The only bad part is that you have to hit it really hard or it won't work right."
3,"Fun, Yes, Exciting, no.. dissapointment but its ok..","Well.. 1st off, bought this as a xmas gift. It looked fun, reviews looked great and all. However.. 1st off.. was there is a lack of songs. I mean wouldve been nice had there been more songs in this.I mean the style of it is ok as you hit the sides or dead center on left or right to work the game.Sure its fun to play and all. But when you played too much DDR and knew what to expect from that and hoped this wouldve been similar, youll be upset because its not.The one thing that IS fun are the mini games. Play this with 2 people and thats where its fun, but the songs itself, not really. It isnt that hard and thats what makes it sad, thought this wouldve tought you how to drum some and not just how to beat the stick. =/Overall a kid would love it, but if your in the 20s and played enough DDR and still do, you probably will find out you wasted your money. =/"
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy Yummy,"Grew up with in New England, could not find in midwest. awsome on Chicken or Turkey! Thighs or legs with salt, pepper, and Bell's Pan Seared then finished in oven are the family's favorate meal"
4,Excellent Product,All the ingredients were very finely ground which made for easy application. The herbs were super fresh and so pungent the UPS van must have smelled like Thanksgiving all day. My dogs ran to the door to greet the UPS driver and stopped in their tracks when they caught a whiff. They were so wide eyed and all sniffing the box. Everyone commented on the stuffing. Thanks for the memories Bell Co.P.S.Mix a pinch or two in your dumpling mix for prize winning Chicken and Dumplings.
5,Bell's is the best.,Bell's is only sold in the Northeast. I moved from NY to MO where they never heard of it. Their loss!
2,works well until warranty period is over,"These access points are extremely well-constructed and work well... for a time. Expect about 18-24 months of useful operation. After 18-24 months, the cheap capacitors inside bulge and start screaming. The receive error rate sky-rockets until they become practically unuseable. So, unless the capacitors on the board have been upgraded, expect a lifetime just longer than the warranty period.I really wish I had not been forced to spend a month figuring out the problem with these access points. They worked so well in the beginning! I own four of these. They all degraded at the same time in the same way. One failed outright. The others continued working, sort of. The receive error rate simply went up to 60% 70% 80% and then 90%. ...Gradual frustration followed by lots of work to figure out the problem."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON!,"After a months of creating cost proposals and shopping, I went to purchase 13 of these DWL-3200AP access points ... and Amazon refused to send more than 3 - yes THREE - to a single address or account! I've never ever in my life heard of a company that refuses to sell their products to their customers! And it wouldn't have been a problem if they ADVERTISED it that way!It's the last straw for me, and I'll be skiing in the desert before I trust Amazon and their lousy UPS shipping again.PS There were plenty of other reputable online retailers who were willing to match this price. Just call and ask."
5,Manager,Our resort needed a stronger product for our wireless. The DWL3200AP was recommended. We updated our wireless to the DWL3200AP and the response was well worth the purchase.
3,so-so,"I'd used one of these before for a cost sensitive customer and they were very happy with it. So when a small school needed to connect two offices 200' from each other, I suggested these. I configured them as WDS no problem, then took one to the office and they were out of range. I took a network analyzer and measured the wireless signal and the Verizon modem/router w/built in wireless (with no external antenna) had a stronger signal and better range!!! Verizon was WEP, I had set these to WPA2 which can cut down on range and it did not help, the Verizon modem was still stronger. I had to send them back :(."
2,Very small,"Very small brush, about 3 inches wide. Picture has the brush on the left side and the spray nozzle on the right side, with a picture of an unopened package in the center. Wasn't expensive enough to bother returning, but hasn't really been worth much for algae scrubbing. Brush is so small it takes a long time."
3,Not much better than a beach read....,"This will be short and only somewhat sweet. Clive Cussler ( with Paul Kemprecos) has written an ok novel about a far fetched theory of an outfit called The Brotherhood. The first chapter on the sinking of the Andrea Doria is pure Cussler. Three hundred and twenty nine pages later we get back to the results of that sinking - somewhat wiser as to why - but this really is a long drawn out story which does little to endear me to the new genre of ""A Novel from the NUMA Files."" It is well enough written and containes some interesting historical assertions - but it is not much better than a beach read. If that's what you are looking for - this will do."
1,Did Cussler really write this?,I snap up Clive Cussler's novels the first day they appear on the store shelves. I read most of his novels in a day or two; sometimes I even skip work. This one took me a couple weeks to finish because it didn't grab my attention. Where are the trademark cliff hangers at the end of each short chapter that make me want to start the next? Gamay and Nina are more interesting characters than Austin and Zavala. At least Perlmutter is still around to amuse and educate us. Where are the maps and illustations that tie into the story? Eventually I finished the book because Cussler's name was on it. But rarely did I see much evidence of his genius touch in the text. The big climax was pitifully short on detail and suspense. It seemed like a B-movie that ran out of funding. Christopher Columbus would have died before he finished reading this book.
4,A Cussler Change,It was nice to see a different set of charaters by Cussler. Though I do have to admit I missed Dirk Pitt. The overall book kepy me intrigued but it was not his best work. I would still recommend it to others that are interested in Cussler's work.
4,Cussler Saves the Day,"What a brilliant piece of writing. The Serpent, Brings Kurt Austin to the middle of Latin America in the deep jungles.And just when you think its going to have one way, the plot twists and turns."
1,Reissue,Don't believe the publication date. This book was originally written in 2000 but is now being issued with a new cover.
4,Good beginning for some new characters,"Well done! I always felt that there had to be someone else in NUMA out having adventures. Kurt and Joe are definitely not Dirk and Al, but I think they will grow on us, the loyal NUMA fans. Give them some time, these guys are just getting started. I couldn't help but notice some strong similarities to ""Inca Gold"", though. All in all, it's another great Cussler read, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of Kurt and Joe. (Just don't forget about Dirk and Al, we still need some continuity!)"
4,"Another Dirk Pitt Classic, but he isn't in it?","All right, this book was completely Dirk Pitt. Just forget those new characters names (I already have,) and replace them with Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.It's a great read, classic Dirk and Al adventure. But they're not in it!!! Why not?? I have no idea. But I would still recommend it. Eventually I got over Dirk's and Al's absence, and I was sucked into the book. This is a must read for any Pitt or Cussler fan."
3,Not as good as his other books,"Bring back Dirk and Al! Clive Cussler has written another great book, but this one lacks the punch and intrigue of his Dirk Pitt novels. Why all of a sudden an introduction of new characters?I am a big fan of Clive Cussler's and will continue to read his works! I hope the next one brings Dirk and Al back for more adventure!"
4,Fantastic surprise! New characters from my favorite author!,"Books by Clive Cussler always promise intrigue, larger than life plots, interesting characters, water, and archaeology. This book does not let us down, and as an added bonus, we have several new and exciting characters to add to the NUMA family. Don't be scared away just because Dirk Pitt has only a cameo appearance in the story. True Cussler fans won't be disappointed. Keep up the good work! I can't wait for the next installment."
2,Dissapointment!,Not up to Cussler's other books. It is as if some one else wrote the book (Paul Kemprecos? ) and used Clive's name.
2,A Politically Correct Collection Of Dirk Pitt Clones.,"I must admit, I am a great Dirk Pitt fan,this may mean that I did not judge this book on its merits.Upon saying this OH DEAR!!!.Has P.C became so bad that The Master Of Adventure has to have a P.C team instead of The Mighty Duo of Dirk and Al.The adventures of the bold Gamy trying to climb out of the underground inca city,was very INCA GOLD,but no Dirk or Al.Finally, does Mr Austin have a wife called Goldie and a bionic eye,leg and arm."
3,Huge Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt fan somewhat disappointed,"I have thouroughly enjoyed every one of the Pitt novels and have even read most of them twice, but I can't help in being disappointed in Serpent. I can't figure out why Cussler would introduce a character so much like Pitt. I can only think that he did not write much of this book, which also disappoints me cuz' now I have to wonder if he's only in this for the money. Serpent is a decent book but quite frankly doesn't keep you at the edge of your seat and is very predictable. I have had 50 pages left to read for about a month now and am beginning to wonder if I'll ever get around to finishing. As I said, not much of an edge of your seat""er"". I however can't wait until Dec 6, 1999 for the next Pitt adventure."
2,Why do this to Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino fans?,"Is it just me or does the tall, handsome, daredevil Kurt Austin appear exactly like the tall, handsome, daredevil Dirk Pitt? And is it just me or did the short, strong, sidekick Joe Zavala appear exactly like the short, strong sidekick Al Giordino. A feeble attempt to introduce new characters who are exactly like the old ones. Don't get me wrong, I like Dirk and Al. But this is a bit silly."
2,We need dirk and al back!,"This book lacked all of the literary plot and depth that made all other of Cussler's books a success. The suspense was lacking, the new young characters seemed stale already, and the threat of the opposition was too easily thwarted. We need something that threatens the world, we need more womanizing, we need more cars, we need Dirk and AL!"
5,WOW!,"What a book! This is one of his best. A new series with new characters, and new adventures. I was a little upset that Clive Cussler's new book wasn't a Dirk Pitt novel, but all anger subsided when I started reading it. I could not put it down! Now I am excited about the new characters and the new series. I hope that there will be more Kurt and Joe adventures, as well as more Dirk and Al adventures."
1,FINALLY a book for the 3 year old mind.,"Seriously, I could not put this book down. I had to see how many more ridiculous circumstances Austin could put himself into with only a ""Kurt Austin Plan"" that can get him out. What is NUMA anyway a CIA front or something? I cannot beleive that two people who seem to always get themselves killed on a daily basis would forget to pack heat. The plot was fairly imaginative, thats the only good point to the entire book, it read like a cheezy Harlequin romance. This is the first book I have read by Clive Cussler and it will be the last, I am so happy it did not buy it, but borrowed it from a friend."
3,"Good Entertainment, But Drifts a Little","This is my second Cussler novel, and it was disappointing after my previous experience. Cussler writes an incredibly interesting plot, and builds his characters well. The disappointment comes in the archeology rabbit chasing. Too much repetitive dribble about archeological references that drag the story somewhat. The character of Nina was building as a major cast member that fades out for too long before working her way back in under a casual involvement with Kurt Austin. The novel is entertaining anyway, and worth the time to read it."
2,Disapointing - one of Cussler's Worst,I've read all of Cussler's books - fiction and non-fiction and this one was by far the worst one he's authored - if he did actually write it. The plots a good one but it never fully develops and the ending is rushed for some reason. The characters don't stack up and the whole thing appears to be just barely held together. I hope the next one is far better...
2,Very disappointed in the effort given to this book.,As a big fan of all the Dirk Pitt adventures I found this one to be lacking in substance. Austin seems to be a clone of Dirk in which case they should have just made it another Pitt adventure. I found the character Gamay to be interesting and with alot of possibilities for future stories.
1,CUSSLER'S NEW HEROES LACK THE ZIP & SPIRIT OF DIRK PITT!,"I have read every one of Clive Cussler's books, and have re-read several of them a second time. His latest, SERPENT, lacks something. Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala are also lacking if they are the ""younger versions"" of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino. The book starts out on a high note, but quickly becomes bogged down in archaeological jungles. After almost 400 pages, an attempt is made to conclude the whole story and wrap up hundreds of loose ends in the last two dozen pages. Hopefully the next Cussler novel will go back to the characters and format that made his work so enjoyable. This one was almost a chore to get through."
1,I've read all of Cussler's works.....this one disapponted me,"I, like many, am a huge fan of Cussler. I can't wait until his new book hits the streets. Always enjoyed Dirk and company and ""oceanographic"" stoylines. Serpent however, was very slow, and I took weeks to read it, when I normally finish his books in days. It just didn't have enough action to keep my interest at a high level. The archilogical story line was too detailed. The few action scenes were good but not enough of them.I hope Clive is not retiring....it just didn't seem at all like his style, flair and content. I will buy his next book but if it is the same ""non-action"", weak heros....I may have to find another author."
2,Reads like two books poorly joined,Disjointed. I got completely lost and actually kept forgetting what the book was supposed to be about. I usually love Cusslers writing but this was a total letdown.
4,Enjoyable,"This is only the second Clive Cussler book I've read (the first was ""Raise the Titanic!"" way back in the 70's). My tastes usually run to weightier fiction, but I found this book surprisingly enjoyable on its own terms. Of course the plot and characters are preposterous, but if you're in the mood for a compulsive page-turner to take to the beach, the gym or on a long flight, this is a good choice. It's cool!"
5,True to form for a classic Cussler book,"This is in my opinion Cusslers best book since Sahara. Kurt Austin is the man for the melinnium. Although I miss Dirk, Cussler immedietly instills a fondness for his new character. There are so many plot twists and turns you find yourself reading just to see who done it and why! For all you Cussler fans this is a must read"
3,Dirk Pitt he ain't...,"Looked forward to this for so long...sigh. Where, of where, is my Dirk? Why do authors who have made millions with established characters feel the need to create other characters...i.e., Cornwell, James Lee Burke, Laurie King? And who is this ""contributor"" coauthor? What's going on with Cussler? The writing is off-tempo and not as strong as in previous books (ok, the early ones WERE a little embarassing for all of us) but Dirk and Cussler grew in their respective talents. Let's hope for a return of the original NUMA crew and bid bye-bye to Kurt. I may be disappointed, but I'll be right here buying the next Cussler creation."
2,"Good Beach Book - But don't analyze the plot, too many holes","The theme of the started out interesting, but somehow it faded as the book progressed. I've read other books by Clive Cussler and enjoyed them. ""Serpent"" was good if you turned off the intellectual portion of your brain and ignored the pieces of the plot that were missing. I felt as though the book stopped rather than ended; but I had fun reading this book (until I got to the end). This book was not as good as other books written by the author."
2,Disappointing...,"I, like many people, look forward to each new Cussler book. I was a bit surprised to find out that Dirk Pitt had been ""retired"", but I thought I would give the book a try. I felt there was too much archeological detail and it dragged on and on... I normally finish a Cussler novel in a couple of days, this one took weeks! Please bring us back Dirk and Al... We miss them!"
3,Plot drags and is overly desriptive on archaelogy.,I have read all of Cussler's books and much prefer Dirk Pitt and crew. These characters were all right but a disappointment to a Cussler fan.There were so many aspects which seems to only lengthen the book.only an archaelogist could enjoy the lengthy descriptions. I also prefer theregular size of a paper back book.
5,A Fun and Fast summer read,"I had this book on my shelf for a little over a year, and hesitated every time i thought of reading it - it just didnt sound that interesting to me.I finally bit the bullet and was quickly swept away in an intriguing adventure tale. The plot is interesting (i dont really care how historically plausible it is), the characters are likeable (although a tad predictable), and the pace is fast and fun. The story has a ""hollywood"" feel to it, and is by no stretch a great piece of literature, but as far as i'm concerned, the writing is good, and it's just a plain old fun read. Isnt that why we read fiction anyway? - for fun?I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quick fun read."
2,Serpent-A weak snake,"I am in the process of reading this book and at this point am disappointed in what I have read. It seems to me the writer (I don't think Clive Cussler had any thing to do with it) tried to imitate the Dirk Pitt character and Cussler style I have come to know and love. The author tries to impress the reader with their vocabulary, but in the process loses the story line and seems to wander around looking for it again. I wish I had noticed Serpent was not the typical Cussler book before buying it."
1,sorry its without Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino,"What's about the Novell Atlantis found. I've read in Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt revealed, that there will be a new book. When will this be published?"
3,a good read but its lacking something,"being a long time clive cussler addict, i would have to say that serpent is not one of his better books maybe that is because there being a co author maybe not.. dont get me wrong it is a enjoyable book as all of his books are. but there seems to be somethings missing. certain references to past books that were changed such as canada not being a part of the u.s. ya i know im nitpicking. but over all a very enjoyable read. i hope these new characters get the chance to grow like dirk and al did in the first books. and maybe someday a cross over book with all the characters in one. that would be interesting."
1,A pale imitation of the Pitt novels.,"It seems to be an attempt to cash in on the Cussler name. It obviously was not written by Cussler. It lacks the verve, vocabulary and wit of the master. This is a disappointing effort - much like the Tom Clancy Net Force novels."
2,Dirk Pitt Wanna-Be,"I was amazed that Clive Cussler takes the time to have his main character Dirk Pitt introduce us at the beginning of his book to this series' new hero - Kurt Autsin. Here, Cussler is obviously trying to immediately convert all Dirk Pitt fans to Kurt Austin fans (Dirk Pitt actually has a ""cameo appearance"" in the book).I went into this book with an open mind, but was dissapointed becuase I was expecting all of the witty dialogue that exists between Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino to also exist between Kurt Austin and his ""sidekick"".Unfortunately, this book lacked the true Cussler witty ""repartee"" and did not keep me on the edge of my seat. With every other Cussler novel that I've read, I can almost never put them down, but with this one, I was almost begging it to end, but kept reading out of respect for prior Cussler novels, hoping that it would get better (unfortunately, it never did)."
2,Dirk Pitt poorly cloned,"Well, obviously Clive Cussler cares about keeping the worth of his trademarked character, Dirk Pitt, intact. Like Tom Clancy, Cussler has franchised this work out; saving the Dirk Pitt name for himself. Surely, as Cussler realized, this is an inferior piece of work and, as such, didn't merit the Pitt or Giordino names. So, poorly-veiled substitute NUMA heroes (Austin and Zapata, I think, but who cares) are used rather than those which have endeared themselves to us in Cussler's previous works. The plot is somewhat preposterous and the pace is erratic. It shows not one iota of the research and historical accuracy of Cussler's earlier works. The conclusion is obvious: This is not a Clive Cussler work; it is just Clive Cussler's name on the cover!"
1,This would be funny if it weren't so pathetic,"What a load of hokey trash. Clive Cussler's earlier books were bad enough to be laughable. This one is worse. Apparently, Cussler has tired of actually writing books, so now he lets someone else write them and puts his name on them. It's sloppy, too. I mean, he has his hero loading up his "".375 Magnum"" revolver with "".50 caliber"" rounds. Give me a break."
1,This work sucks techno wind,"Not only are the grammatical errors a problem, but the incorrect technical stuff can drive anyone with half a brain insane. There was no such culture as the Mayans - it's Mayas. Look it up. The research on this work stunk and the premise was weak. The key villian would have to be a bastard child if he were from Spanish heritage with Maya ancestory - think about it. The action sequences were weak and slow and the heros were longing for mental support. I've seen better work from first time writers. There was no suspense and even less heart in this book. Clive might not have been the greatest, but at least he could spin a story with some accuracy and excitement (in the past). Serpant is a cheap imitation of what could have been a good novel."
2,Too bad- it could have been soooo much better.,"I read the other reviews before starting this. Some loved it, others were disappointed. I have to believe that if you have never before read a Cussler book, you would enjoy this one. If you do enjoy Cussler's other books, then you will spend the majority of your time noting the similarities to the Dirk Pitt series.On the other hand, I don't think Mr. Cussler ever really claimed to be a world-class author. If I'm not mistaken, he uses the income from his books to finance his other interests- interests that the rest of us can only dream about. So- if you have a long plane flight sometime, read the book. If you are looking for a new hero to read about, skip it. You already know these guys."
3,Not one of Cusslers better books,"Unlike the other Dirk Pitt/NUMA adventures, which I can't put down until I finish reading the very last page, I found myself wishing this one would end soon.Unlike his other books, this books plot and subplots, just dragged on and on, with none of them generating any real excitement.The book never really built up to any sort of climax, leaving the reader feeling sort of empty at the end.I found his new characters, Kurt Austin and his partner, flat and uninteresting. None of the snappy banter that occurs between Dirk and Al.One reason this book seemed ""lackluster"" compared to his other books could have to do with the fact that Cussler had a co-writer on this book.Bottom line, it's a fair ""adventure book"", but a bad ""Cussler adventure book""."
3,He just ain't Dirk!,"Although I recognized the Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novel pattern in Serpent, I couldn't help being turned off by Kurt Austin. Right from the beginning I got a mental picture - somewhere along the lines of Jeff Chandler - and didn't like it. The spirit and personality that so epitomizes Dirk (like Indiana Jones and 007 all roled into one)just wasn't there for this character. The story definitely had possibilities and if it was rewritten with Dirk and crew I think it would play better. I am anxiously awaiting Christmas morning when I get my copy of Atlantis Found and Dirk and I can take off on another adventure. Serpent was okay, but the characters just didn't work for me. Glad we're back to Dirk and the Gang. I will say though, should Mr. Cussler choose to do another Kurt Austin adventure, I will most certainly read it and give it a chance. Who knows, maybe he just needs to grow on me."
2,Not what you expect from Cussler,"Too much rambling about archeology and not enough action. Reads like a textbook. I too think Cussler did not write much of the book at all. I found myself skipping pages looking for action and not missing anything when passing over the long-winded ""digging for treasure"" educational paragraphs."
3,Bravo to the Reader from Philadelphia!,"Well said! If Mr. Cussler is listening, this is his wake up call. I predict that many readers will hesitate before buying his next book. I know I will. Especially if he continues to use a co-author. Mr. Cussler's next book will need to be better than great to overcome Serpent's shortcomings."
3,This was not one of Clive Cusslor's better masterpieces.,"As a diehard Cussler fan, I jumped at the sight of the book when I noticed the book on the shelf at the bookstore.Now, even my wife noticed that I was laboring to read this book.With Dirk Pitt in the game, a book would usually take two or three days to finish.My theory,Don't pee down my back and tell me its raining.Dirk is the man!"
2,Who wrote this book anyway?,"As another die-hard, read-em-all Cussler fan, I find myself wondering how much our beloved author actually contributed to the writing of this one? Seems like the new characters might be a tool to help hide the fact that the co-author actually wrote the book. It's just not the page turner I'm used to. I have no problem trying out a new author, especially one with Cussler's stamp of approval, but I'd prefer to not be misled by the cover. Most of us fans (I suspect) are so loyal because of the writing, not the topic areas. A book about Cussler-type topics is not my interest, a book with Cussler-type suspense is. If Cussler's taking time off, it's well-earned, but his name shouldn't be used in the interim to sell other's books."
4,"Enjoyable, but plot is lifted from ""Treasure"" and","Also, it really seems pointless is replacing Dirk and Al with almost identical counterparts. Still a great page turner, and I like Austin and Zavala, but i don't understand the change."
4,The book ended too fast.,"""Serpent"" was an interesting book with a lot of set-up and action which is typical Cussler. I have always enjoyed Cussler's other books but this one seemed abit thin on the ending. All of a sudden the bad guys enter in and are defeated in a few pages. And I am sorry to say it was predictable. I liked the past Cussler endings that were dramatic with a twist. It still is a good read and the new heros are refreshing. Buy it and enjoy!"
4,great action!,"It is very refreshing to have a new character in the series. Kurt Austin is younger and not nearly as cynical as Pitt. This was a great action book, but at times I get tired of how ruthless the antagonist is. In all his book they always seem to be without emotions or humanity."
3,Serpent Slowly Slithers Through Its Plot,"Teams of archaeologist around the world are missing. One survivor of a Mexican expedition claims her team was murdered by mysterious assasins. The National Underwater & Marine Agency, (NUMA), goes on the hunt to stop these murderers and to understand their motives. Their quest takes them inside Mayan ruins and to the depths of the sunken Andrea Doria.Serpent is very good in portraying a historical mystery involving Christopher Columbus. It is superb in taking the reader through the perils of a Mexican jungle. The overall plot is too far fetch, removing the readers from their suspension of disbelief. The pace is inconsistent with large pockets of boredom between good portions of suspension.Serpent is a decent beach book. The author is attempting to develop a parallel series to Dirk Pitt, a best selling favorite. This is a weak start. Give us Dirk!"
4,Not his style,"This book is not Clive's style. The first few chapters, not dealing with NUMA were too different from other Clive Cussler Books. I felt I was not reading a Clive Cussler Book. Once NUMA appeared it was like being back ""home"""
4,It was very good but I kept on comparing Kurt and Dirk,"The book Serpent bt Clive Cussler was good in a sence of plot, but the charactors (Kurt and Joe) are nothing like the infamous Dirk Pitt and Albert Giorodino or however you spell it."
4,A quick read for a quick write!,"When I went to my local bookstore and saw a new novel by CLIVE CUSSLER, I just HAD to get it. The next day, I hopped on the PWC, found a secluded lakeside spot, and read the book in one sitting. Historically motivated plot, new characters, cameos by our old favorites, Cussler at his best, right? Well, not exactly! My favorite author takes so long between Dirk Pitt novels that it almost seems like he HAD to quickly create a novel to tie his fans over until ATLANTIS FOUND. I liked the new characters and the fresh writing style of his co-author, but it seemed a bit rushed and unsatisfying overall (I'm spoiled by DP novels, what can I say!). Knowing CUSSLER, the next one will be much better ... RIGHT Mr.C?"
5,A romp with NUMA with characters you already know,"Though there are new characters in Serpent, Dirk and Al are back as Kirk and Joe. Other than that, though, it is business as usual for Clive Cussler, which is to say a wonderful read. It was disappointing that the book came out as a paperback, and that the editor's quality control left something to be desired. But I read Cussler for the story, and he delivers!"
5,Good reading,great book but then most of Clive Cussler's books are very readable and I appreciate the fact that it is clean reading.
2,The Serpent,"I've read all previous Cussler novels and loved every one. Serpent is a failed attempt to substitute two new characters in a story that apes but never equals Dirk Pitt. Sorry, Clive"
3,A Disappointing First Kurt Austin Attempt,"Well, actually Austin did not disappoint me, it is more on Mr. Cussler's side. Do not get me wrong, I am an avid Cussler fan. This is my third Austin novel and Nth for Pitt. It is a disaster finding, for reading this novel is not finding what you are actually finding for. Later Austin novels were much more refined.A 2.5-3 star only for it is one of worst Cussler novels."
2,Read a Dirk Pitt novel instead....,"I have read just about every one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels and loved them all. Sadly this book just doesn't measure up. I am not sure why the auther has created a different hero, Kurt Austin, who then shares so many similarities to the very popular Dirk Pitt. He even has his own sidekick -- who steals Sandecker's cigars!?!?! The story itself is not very entertaining and I only finished it hoping that it might get better along the way. It didn't."
3,Somewhat disappointing by Cussler standards,"I have read every other Cussler novel to date and so I was very excited when I saw this on the shelf. Unfortunately, the pace was somewhat slower than his other works. He also left some loose ends dangling (ie, what were those papers in Columbus' hands?)which is unlike him. I think there is hardly any difference between Dirk and Kurt. As a matter of fact, they seem interchangable to me. I'll be looking out for Atlantis Found. I hear it's due out in September. His last Pitt novel, Flood Tide was kind of weak as well. I'm hoping for a strong comeback."
4,Running Out of Ideas?,"One of the reasons that Mr. Cussler's works are so popular are the wild flights of fancy that we are taken on. Sinister villains living out of underwater seamounds? Secret moon bases? The United States of Canada? Not a problem for Clive. But, Bronze Age treasure expeditions in the New World? Southwest latino uprisings? Haven't we seen this in ""Treasure""? Central American archeology? Underwater rivers? Sound like ""Inca Gold"" to you? Clive, are you running out of ideas?"
3,It was to simple,"I am a long time devoted Clive Cussler fan, I have to say that in Serpent there was a good plot,an exciting story, the heros were great ( though I miss Dirk and Al), but something was seriously lacking, it was too easy, I did not get the sense of the life and death struggle that I am accustom to in the in a Clive Cussler novel. The characters went through a great adventure ( I did love the cameo by Dirk and Al ) but toward the end Kurt and Joe seemed to breeze through the Andrea Doria and the final climax, I felt like I was left hanging, wanting more, unlike any Clive Cussler novel that I have read."
3,"Sorry, Mr. Cussler. Serpent falls short of expectations.","I have read every Clive Cussler novel and, like most Cussler fans, can hardly wait for his next release. So I was excited to see Serpent on the bookshelf. However, as I read Serpent, I found myself trying to guess what, if any, contributions Mr. Cussler made to the story.I consider myself a die-hard Clive Cussler fan and hate to say it, but Serpent just doesn't live up to any of Mr. Cussler's other novels. Even Pacific Vortex, Clive's very first attempt at writing, is a much better book that displays a style and character that is unique only to Cussler.Sorry, Mr. Kemprecos. Although I found moments in Serpent that reminded me of Cussler's style, they were too few and far between. This only proves how difficult it must be to imitate the real McCoy. If it is any consolation, the book, although not great, is still enjoyable. Even a bad Cussler book is better than none at all."
3,"A fun read, but not as engrossing as his usual stuff","I was hooked on Cussler by my husband, who was able to overlook the often chauvinist overtones of the books. While I always enjoy the twists of the tale and action, I often found the writing a little ""cartoonish"", glorifying Pitt as more-than-man, less-than-god. So I found myself enjoying this book for following many characters and their adventures, including capable women working along with the men, leading them to the conclusion. The plot was not as exciting as past novels, and I figured out much of the end ahead of time, but it was a fair trade-off for a writing style I found more pleasing."
5,Wow!,I bought this book on recommendation of a CC fan. My dad read it non-stop from the time he got up until he went to bed. Thought it was pretty good. So I read it myself and couldnt put it down. Havent read any of Clive Cusslers books but I plan to. Mostly to see what all the bad reviews are about
3,Kurt Austin the new lead or is it Gamay and Nina?,"The introduction of Kurt Austin by Dirk Pit sets the stage for a new Numa book. However, after reading Serpent, it seems that the characters that were larger than life were the woman of the story, either Gamay or Nina. In fact, for a while there, while reading, I thought that the main character was Gamay. She seemed to spring to more daring escapades (ala Dirk Pit) then Kurt had at that point in the book. In fact, Kurt Austin does not come across as a good leading character.However, I think I would have felt better about the book if that silly Dirk Pit introduction wasn't there. And, the notion that this Numa Special Assignments team (Kurt, Zavalla, Gamay, and Paul) has various adventures together is somewhat intriguing and worth some play. Sort of like the Numa Fantastic Four."
2,A large disappointment,"I am an avid Cussler reader but was very disappointed in the ""Serpent."" Ocassionally I thought I could see a few pages where Author Cussler took over and tried to inject his much beloved writing style but overall he was not successful. The plot is confusing and quite improbable. If Kurt Austin is the new Dirk Pitt then perhaps I have a chance also. Give me back Dirk Pitt, his friends and novels written only by Clive Cussler."
4,Clive Cussler,The story was very good but I was dissapointed that I was sent a library book & the cover wasn't in very good shape. The story itself was very exciting as is all of Clive Cussler's books.
1,Avoid,"Clive Cussler is great -- let's start with that. Unfortunately, one can't say the same for Paul Kemprecos, who presumably bore the lion's share of writing this book. Yes, all the action takes place in Cussler's NUMA world but the plot is thin and the characters are so bland that, in the final scene, you find yourself turning back to the start to reassure yourself the hero is really the hero. Worse, any thriller reader will recognise the immediate similarities between the final plot line of this book and the one in Wilbur Smith's River God/Seventh Scroll duo, at least in as muich as there is a fabulous treasure hiudden in an ancient tomb that is in turn under under water protected by a dam. Not worth the money."
4,Different NUMA characters; Same Cussler,"I was surprised to read so many dissenting viewpoints regarding this Cussler collaboration. I have read all his books and while I was concerned that Dirk Pitt was not the featured artist, after reading it, I found Kurt Austin a solid replacement. Likewise for Al and Joe. I thought it was a fascinating plot with lots of adventure and excitement. The story leaves you thinking of a number of possibilities regarding the Mayan culture and its earliest visitors from the old world. It was well integrated into today's real world, and is entirely plausible. For a fictional yarn, it still leaves you wandering long after the book is completed. I would recommend a prospective reader of this book to decide for himself if Cussler has done a ""Clancy"" by collaborating. I hardly think so. I will be looking for his next NUMA file novel."
2,Investing for Dummies,Buy low and sell high. Keep stock for years and diversify your portfolio. Now you've already read the book
1,"page 26, Eric exposes his anti-gun bias in an investing book","page 26, Eric exposes his anti-gun bias in his investing book. What does this type of propaganda have to do with investing Eric? He also states that futures and options should be avoided...Also states that gold and silver are ""lousy"" investments..."
3,speculative buy rating,Here is the best way I can describe this book: It is like a LONG encyclopedia article about investing. This book touches on all the basics but does not get in depth with any one issue. Good for an initial education but DO NOT start investing after you read it! I am not going to get in depth with this review so here is the summary: Too much what you SHOULD do. Not enough how to do it.BDS III
3,Paper assets,"I read mutual funds for dummies first and thought I'd grab this book, the book isn't bad at all, but I believe this author has much more knowledge about mutual funds than any other investment strategy. I personally am not looking to change jobs and start up my own small business and I don't consider that an investment, if so why not consider going to college to become a doctor an investment, you could do an entire chapter on that.Basically the chapters about paper assets were pretty good, but the small business section was a waste of my time personally and if I wanted to open up my own business I wouldn't have bought this book. The real estate section wasn't that great either and I think it's because he knows mutual funds the best and other paper assets over real estate and any other investment strategy."
5,A nice basic review of Ephesus.,If you are going to Turkey and want to brush up on what is in Ephesus this is a nice review of the amazing sites that are there. I really like it and it's a good memory of a fantastic trip as well.
4,The London Sound,"This is a wonderful compilation of songs from some of the leading acts in the UK, including Oasis, The Charlitans, Depeche Mode, Stone Roses and a host of others. The album takes a couple of twists and turns in styles with the hip-hop sounds of Stereo MCs, to the dreamy vocals provided by Lush, and to the happy-go-lucky tune from Cornershop. It was a shame that the enigma of the UK, Morrissey, was not included in this compliation since he certainly adds a dimension to the great music coming over from the pond. One album cannot cover the gammet of Indie from the other side of the Atlantic, but this is certainly a very good start. So if you have any Smiths, New Order, The The, Housemartins or Suede (who is on 'Shine' as well), then I recommend adding this album to your collection. The double CD will certainly whet your appetite, 'ole chap!"
3,Cane holder,Cane holder lacked enough tension to hold it in place in some places. At times the cane was easily knocked over by the slightest touch
2,Did not serve the purpose.,"It's not like it was described incorrectly, it just did not work with the kind of cane I usually use."
3,"Pretty good, but dated","This was a good book when it was written. It provides a pretty good overview of many of the basics and some more advanced topics. The basic information hasn't changed but there are other books that cover it better. (I would recommend Gabriel Suarez's Tactical Pistol Marksmanship, Tactical Pistol and Tactical Advantage). Quite a bit of information is dated in this and reflects the concerns of the late 1970's and early 1980's."
1,Guess I was right after all,"I said that this book was obsolete in '99 and now even Plauger has tacitly agreed. Check out his book on the STL. While the IO stuff in it is still germain, the collection stuff is totally out of date. This book is a waste of $. ..."
4,The best book to discover all C++ libraries and functions,"This books includes a full describition of how to use all C++ libraries and their functions. If you are interested in learning the new powerful features of the C++ libraries, then this is an excellent book. This book has taught me how to use most of the new functions found in the C++ libraries which definately strenghtened my programming performance."
1,Out of date,This book is definitely out of date. The standard library was completely revised by the adoption of STL. This book shouldn't be sold any more.
1,This book is obsolete.,Even the sections marked as being future changes are obsolete. Don't buy this book. Get a book on STL instead.Plauger didn't make the big pile he thought he would off his 'standard' library. Hurray for HP and SGI.
2,"A beginner book... Not a ""black"" book...",I was looking at a great reference book to go far inside MacOS X....NetInfo is talked about only half a page !I just have it on my library and will never open it again... :-/
4,Mac OS X Version 10.1 Black Book,"This is a good book for any user of Mac OS X. It can be very basic in its instructions and descriptions, but can also prove to be a good reference book for the more advanced user. It you are a complete UNIX nerd, skip it and buy a UNIX specific book. This book should answer many of your OS X questions."
2,Not for Power Users,"I find the book informative and well written, but this is not for power users. It contains beginner information and how to use popular 3rd party utilities. The book lacks depth, and Unix shell is in an appendix. If you are looking for a book to explore the unix side of Mac OS X, look elsewhere. If you are looking on how to set up your user environment and are looking for some possible shareware or 3rd party utilities to enhance your use of OS X, then this is for you.This book is targeted to the wrong audience. It is an intermediate book. I say skip it.Buy Mac OS X Unleashed"
1,Save your money,"If this book is as poorly written as another book by Mark R. Bell then you might as well save your money or buy another Mac OS X 10.1 book by another notable Mac writer. While I haven't read this new edition, I did read his book on Mac OS X which was almost a complete waste of my time. I got more out of reading MacWorld and MacAddict articles on OS X than I got out of his book."
1,Unreliable,Difficult to read the raised plastic numbers on the dials. Not user friendly to set. The 5-minute watering interval settings are not accurate. Recommend a digital model instead.
5,it now works with a MAC,Now the 3650 works with the Macs Isync program for transfering your contacts. It will also work with the Macs bluetooth. I got the phone and love it. I go online through the phone on my Mac G4 Powerbook with a Dlink USB Bluetooth adaptor. Its takes some work with your providers tech support to tweek the settings but it works great after that. If your having problemes with your Mac make sure you have the new versions of Bluetooth and Isync downloaded. Have fun.
1,Cheap looking,"This phone has great functionality but unless you are a 12 year old and don't mind being embarrassed by taking this phone out of your pocket then buy it. The first thing I thought when I saw it was that my TV remote is smaller, which is true. The second thing I thought was how it looks nothing like the picture. I was expecting a nice, sturdy case but what I got was cheap looking, tacky plastic. Buy another Nokia instead, I sent mine back and exchanged it for the new Ericsson."
4,It does what is says it's going to do.,I got this phone in October and it's been great so far. All of the features work. It is bigger than other phones but it is soooo fun to play with when you have some extra time on your hands. I've really appreciated it while standing in long shopping lines. I think you can get the most from this phone only if you sign up for internet access through your service provider. The icing on the cake is the fact that it's free with Amazon and T-Mobile rebates.
2,"Nice features, but it's a phone first...","I'm shocked that one of the biggest cell phone companies would fall into such a horrible design trap. In their effort to make this phone look ""cool,"" they placed the buttons in a circle around the center of the phone. How many people are used to dialing with such a keypad? It's not prohibitively difficult, but it's enough of a hastle to simply go with a comparable phone with a normal keypad. Nokia should remember that the 3650 is a phone first. Unfortunately, in this case, they sacrificed usability for appearance."
5,Mac USers: It is now compatible!,"This phone is loaded with features and since yesterday, is now compatible with macs. It's easy to use and worth every penny."
4,"almost perfect, but....","Great Phone!!! Everything you need for style and function is in this phone, except: large size, button position, great color(but not the best), rather not efficient battery usage..That's all!!!"
5,Great Nokia packed with features,"NOKIA 3650 is packed full of great features...all of which are easy to operate. The camera is especially easy to use. I have had no problems with lock up or reception as others have reported. The only problem I have had is keeping other people from playing with it. The functions are very entertaining, and creating pictures and messages to send to others is easy to do. The dial is an especially creative with its circular design. It really makes the phone stand out from the rest. The entire phone is a real attention getter, but proves to be just as practical as it is attractive. Battery life is much longer than I would expect for the functions this phone performs.I have not dropped mine as another reviewer did, I will continue to avoid doing so as it would be a careless thing to do. Look for rebates from nokia or service providers. It will be well worth your investment no matter what you pay."
5,Its a great Phone for its value,"Its really a great phone with lot of java enabled features if you are really a techie, you can do manythings on this phone. I loved this phone, as java is open programming platform you will find lot of freeware utilities to play with. I installed some freeware software available and those programs are really cool. Good thing is any java techie can write their own programs (isn't it amazing?)"
4,after the long wait....,"i've been waiting for this phone to get released here ever since i left the UK 2 years ago when it was just about to be released there. well, it's finally here, and actually i have yet to purchase it for two reasons - one - amazon doesn't 'do' cingular wireless (my current carrier) WHY?? - and two - the lack of bluetooth support from nokia for the mac OS's...i'm really responding to the review from the person who contacted nokia cust. service and spoke with someone. well, i went to the nokia website and kicked off. i have done this in the past and they've gotten back to me. basically, they need to know there are MAC users out there that will use it. and as a MAC finatic and a lover of nokia's there's no way i'm getting the cheap and nasty sony ericsson t68 (my husbands is already wrecked). so if you like this phone and have a MAC i suggest letting them know they should get their acts together."
2,Nothing but aggravation!!,I had this phone for 4 months.Cons:Poor receptionSuper bulkyCamera phone resolution is so-soPros:Good speakerphone
1,Security Concerns,"My only concern in ordering phones from Amazon.com is that last I checked, they want to know your DOB, and Social Security number on behalf of the carriers.Amazon has no business in collecting this information. The carriers have been doing this for years. Anytime you buy a phone from them they collect that information anyway. Although according to govt. agencies even they have no business collecting your SS#.Providing credit card number over a SSL connection is ok and I do that all the time on amazon.com. But providing DOB, SS# to amazon.com (even if its using SSL) will make your vital information live on one more database i.e Amazon's database which is ridiculous and not acceptable. So amazon doesn't get my business for the phones."
3,Not compatible with mac,"After hearing many rave reviews on this phone and assessing it's many pluses (mainly bluetooth and expandable memory), I was disappointed to find out that this phone and it's software is not compatible with a mac....And after talking to a Nokia support employee at 1-888-665-4228, I learned that they have no future plans to make it compatible. Too bad, Nokia gets a thumbs down from me! I guess I will be waiting for Sony Ericsson's T-610P.S. After asking if I could listen to my favorite internet stations via real player, he also informed me that the capability was there, but that no providers support it at this time."
1,Boot failure,"The phone has some cool features that I liked. However, the phone stopped working altogether after a month's use. When I tried to power the phone on, a flashing 'Nokia' logo appeared for a few seconds and the phone powered back off. I took it to a T-mobile store and they told me that the phone wasn't going through the boot cycle.T-mobile was nice to promptly send me a replacement phone. However, after a weeks use, I had the exact same problem and was forced to send the phone back. Now, I think I have had enough of this phone and it's time to move onto to some other phone that doesn't keep failing to boot. All cool features aside, what are you going to do when the phone refuses to power on!!"
4,It's nice phone...,Reception of this phone is excellent. I have received it after two days.There are two problems with this phone:1) rotary dialer buttons are a bit small and they are not suitable for all hands.2) games come with phone suck.
1,not so good....,although this phone is quite cool to look at it is huge. not huge as in comparatively with such phones as the T610 (Sony Ericsson) but huge compared to my dad's Buick LeSabre. the phone does not have 65K colours and has a pathetic camera. the camera is not as good as the T610's or even as good as the camera my sister got free in her barbie doll set. a very dissapointing phone. so big and heavy it tore a hole in my jacket. meanwhile ... from nokia similar price and much better is the 7250i (this is the ugly phone by the way) - do yourselves a favour - dont buy the 3650
3,Not compatible with a mac,"After hearing many rave reviews on this phone and assessing it's many pluses (mainly bluetooth and expandable memory), I was disappointed to find out that this phone and it's software is not compatible with a mac....And after talking to a Nokia support employee, I learned that they have no future plans to make it compatible. Too bad, Nokia gets a thumbs down from me!P.S. After asking if I could listen to my favorite internet stations via real player, he also informed me that the capability was there, but that no providers support it at this time."
2,Regret buying,"I was quite excited to be getting this phone, given all its functionality. The size & key pad were not (and still are not) hinderancs. The ENORMOUS problem has been with its bluetooth functionality. I have spent over 25 hours talking with Nokia customer service & 2 different Bluetooth manufacturers (Belkin & Linksys). None can fix the problem. The bluetooth companies blame Nokia & Nokia blames the bluetooth companies. Meanwhile, my phone's functionality (a KEY reason why I bought this phone) still does not work, I've wasted over 25 hours with tech people, & no answer seems in sight. This has been an exhausting and extraordinarly disapointing purchase. I could NOT recommend this prodect - or Nokia, given their poor customer service - at all."
2,So full of problems and bugs!,"So far I have been very disappointed in this phone. Basically, it has corrupted it's own memory (I had to restore from SD memory), cannot seem to sync up the Time and locks up more than a few times a week.Using bluetooth is a real hassle since it locks up 3 out of 4 times when I use it. The sound quality is fairly awful also.. but I'm not sure if T-Mobile is to blame or if the phone is just really bad. I'm willing to bet it's the phone.All in all, it has so many cool features but half of the time it doesn't seem to work. So, unless I just got a junk phone.. this Nokia is not really impressing me much.Oh, one last thing.. it actually interferes with Cordless phones (yes.. not just using bluetooth! I have been asked not to use my cellphone by Cordless phone users because it causes major static disruption)Sorry to be so negative. It sure seemed like it was going to be a great phone. I guess I'm stuck with it.. so I'll just try to deal with all the problems. :)"
2,Problems,"The features of the telephone are excellent. I often use the Text Messaging, and I also have downloaded a few games, which provide a huge upgrade over snake, and some other basic games available. While I enjoy the phone I purchased on April 15, 2003, I have had to return it 5 TIMES!My phone has also had the same problem each time, which is the phone will appear to have shut down/turn off. When you press the power on/standby button, your phone shows Nokia, and then nokia fades out, as if the phone is restarting. It repeats this vicious cycle 3-4 times, when the phone turns off completely.Maybe the problem is my Memory card? Maybe it's my battery? Each time I've called w/ questions, they insist it is not either of these two options. I have tried another battery, and the same thing happens.My point is that being as the phone is fairly new to the US market, any problems/questions you may have with service will be mighty testing."
1,No Service Available,"We purchased the T Mobile Nokia 3650 phone and service and the phone is amazing.One problem...I can't talk on it.We were sold a service that isn't available in our area.We live in area code 47401 and were told we were in T Mobile range We finally got them to admit that we are in limited range of service.Needless to say,we have no service and the reps at T Mobile have been of little to no help in resolving our problem.I still am not sure if I am going to get a refund for the phone and a cancellation for the service without having to pay penalties!!? It is extremely frustrating."

3,Nice Looking Phone But ...,"This phone is HUGE compares to most of the regular phones these days. I bought the phone for its Bluetooth and Internet access capability. The Bluetooth connection works well with generic Bluetooth connectors but not its Infra-red. I had very quickly given up on the Internet access since I could not even connect to it most of the time and when I could, it's slow. However, the emaill access and synchroniztion to Microsoft Outlook works wonderfully as long as I could access the Internet. I have complaints that I sound soft through the phone. It is also annoying that I'll get a text message whenever I get a voice mail. So, you have to delete the message AND the voice mail separately.The ring tone is soft and so, I usually miss my calls. The battery does last for a significant time between charges, at least when it is currently new."
2,u will miss lot of calls,"I don't know how many calls i missed with this phone bacause ringer sound is so low. If you put your phone in your purse or your pocket, you will not hear your phone ringing. Plus, without my handset, I coudln't barely hear. Only reason I bought this phone is that it had a camera. But I found out I couldn't send multimedia messege like the commercial unless the person I am sending it to had same carrier as i did. Do yourself a favor, avoid this phone!!!!"
3,Nokia 3650 Phone,"This phone is an okay phone. The pros: screen saver, you can put any background onto your phone, take somewhat decent photos, many ring tones, it takes only a few minutes to completely charge the phone.The cons: they charge quite a bit each month for their internet service, you can ONLY email pictures from your phone if you purchase the internet service, you can barely hear a lot of the ring tones from your phone, you must stay very still when you snap a picture, if you get too close to a person's face, they wind up looking like Mr. Potato Head in the picture, the phone itself feels like it's made of very cheap plastic, you can't get good reception a lot of the time, especially at home."
2,Get a different phone,"I've decided to get a different phone. My biggest complaint is that this phone spontaneously turns off (even when it's locked). When it is on, the ring tones are hard to hear. The default ""Select"" button is in the middle of the arrow buttons, and it takes me 3 or 4 tries to push it sucessfully."
2,"The phone has great features, but the software/OS is buggy","This phone is great for features, its camera is amazing, and it gets good signal. I would love all of this were it not for the awful OS. My first phone inexplicably died 8 months after purchase, sitting right on my desk. The replacement unit was great for a month and now, sometimes the phone locks up when I try to look at the Call History or text Messages. I'd say the phone locks up on me almost daily.As I said, I love the features, but in the end, it sometimes doesn't function well as a phone. So beware."
2,"Looks good , nice features, not usable indoors","Got it yesterday, seemed cool, lots of features, came all set setup and ready to use (battery charged, acct setup).Used around house seemed fine, today in office no signal, in Target no signal , in grocery store no signal.Seems like in N.J. w/ Tmobile not usable indoors at all.Tried N. Jersey and central Jersey. Outside seems fine.So if u want it for the cool look/features but not to make/receive calls then it's fine.Not sure if it's the built in antenna or tmobile or both."
2,Still can't synch via Bluetooth to PC,"I am on my third bluetooth adapter, trying to synch my PC with my Nokia 3650. First I got a Hawking Bluetooth Adapter, but Nokia said they don't support that. The tech rep told me they support Belkin and Socket. Since Belkin was the cheaper and smaller, using USB, I bought that. It didn't work and Nokia's tech said, ""we don't support Belkin"" !!! ERRG. So I got the Socket. It doesn't work. Nokia tells me the problem is with Socket. I call Socket, wait for 3 hours on hold and never get through. I send an email. No response. I leave a voice mail. No response. I'm wishing I didn't buy this phone.To top it off, Amazon.com denied my $200 refund claiming I didn't send it in on time (I did) Since I can't find the post office receipt, I can't proove it. MAKE SURE YOU SEND YOUR REBATE FORM IN REGISTERED MAIL AND KEEP THE RECEIPT!! Otherwise, AMazon.com may rip you off for the $200. Live and learn."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Hello! I recently purchased this phone directly from T-Mobile and it's awful! My sister has one as well and they in fact, do shut off ""automatically"". I've had the phone exchanged 4 times, my sister 5 and they have all had that problem. Customer service sucks and they are trying to charge me 300$ if I want a new phone from a different brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,TOO bulky,"The pictures clicked is are not great, poor color, poor enginnering of the phone(the back lid of the phone always keep shaking). And I hear echo while talking on the phone i dont know whether its because the service I have(T-Mobile) or because of the phone. I do not recomment others to buy this phone."
3,Nokia 3650,"Very disappointed because this phone is way too quiet, almost inaudible in all but one of its many ring tones. Sound clarity and range are good, but battery life is poor, about 2 days max. If the ring tones could be heard I would rate this phone a lot higher. It is also very spendy! Too bad a normally well made product came out without checking to find out if it can be heard.Shame on you NOKIA!"
3,good and bad,Been using this phone for about a year.pros:big screencamerareception is good (tmobile)cons:operating system problemsphone shuts off anytime it likesringer sometimes rings at a lower tone so u miss callsthe phone is fat
4,"nice phone, little bit delicate for routine use","This is excellent phone with lots of features. I've it from AT&T wireless and happy with it. It can do Bluetooth, Irda & Wifi. Reception of phone is much better than T68i."
4,tha234,i love this nokia phone and i have been ready to buy it because it is my dream phone. i like it because of its camera and recorder the phone is one of the phones nokia settled down and worked well and it has a lot of features..WAYNE WONDER MAKES USE OF IT AND I AM SURE HE LOVES IT VERY WELL......
1,"Ok Phone, Bad Service","Overall the phone is okay and probably a three star phone. It takes awhile to get use to the circular dial. If you are a Sprint user, forget about the four digit dial. Also, the phone freezes if you press the buttons too fast. The most disappointing aspect is the poor coverage with TMobile phones. I purchased the phone because it was the best deal out there in terms of phone cost and number of minutes included in the plan. I signed a one year agreement and purchased through Amazon. i had no problems getting my rebate or activation of the phone. With routine travel to DC, San Diego, Denver and Orlando the coverage is extremely sporadic and sound quality is very poor. It seems like TMobile is basically in the process of buying business to justify improvements to their network. I will be switching to Verizon the day my contract expires. I discourage users from signing up with TMobile."
1,not the best ..,"funky dialing is a pain, call quality is iify, could live with all thatBUT T-Mobile is useless where I live. Only works 50 ft down the yard fromthe house and within a 1/2 mile of one highway. 60% of the area is dead-zone. T-Mobile's answer to no call service was ""I'm sorry, we'll give you xx minutes free added to this month.""Free minutes in a dead-zone, that makes sense.. yeah right!Get a Motorola Razr on a better carrier.Switched to AT&T;, and I have a real cell phone. This model didn't workwith AT&T; network."
2,complex to use and died after 6 months,"It took time to get used to the keypad and it's not worth the effort. Then it kept cutting out/ending calls. Finally it just died. And Nokia says they give a 1yr guarantee, but its not that easy. I'm switching companies after this."
2,"May have all the features, but is it worth it","This phone has all the features you could think of, internet, video, audio recorders, camera, etc. The camera may be handy when you have nothing else, but the resolution is horid and its almost useless. I dont ever really get to use any of the features. I really like the speaker phone! It is so bulky everyone always gives me wierd looks because they cant figure out if it is a phone or palm pilot. The material it is made out of seems real flimsy. It's difficult to quickly text mail with the circled key pad. The ring tones are hardly audible. Sometimes it goes online on its own and I get charged. Nokias are easy to navigate, but overall the phone just has too much useless stuff and is too big."
4,good phone for the price,"Truely, this is a great phone at this price.. Bluetooth works great with my laptop.. Nokia has a good support.. The only flaws with this phone were the following,1. the keys are in circle and difficult to use for SMS etc.2. the ringing is not as loud as of Motorola or Ericcson.3. the speaker phone is also not too loud. Can hear it when noise around u is less.4. sometimes the phone switches off by itself.5. the GPS service for AT&T is not having a good coverage."
2,Horrible service,"I loved the phone, and I don't think any other phone in current market can beat it but lags with patchy and horrible service. It has all functions anyone can ask for, including palm type, easy link to computer for synching, very nice camera, awesome screen and the dial. Only cons, I see is the size of it and the material it is made of, once it is dropped, marks and cracks on it really hurts if you are attached to this beautiful phone."
3,Ringer problems,"I was very happy with this phone for about a week until I took the phone out and noticed that I'd missed about 10 calls. It seems several of the Nokia 3650s have a lovely little problem with the ringer. It starts out fine, but as time goes on, it gets quieter and quieter. Eventually, even with the ringer set to full volume, you can barely hear the ringer at all (though when you test the ringer under profiles it sounds just fine). The only solution is to have it set to vibrate at the same time and then the ringer volume is fixed.At the moment I'm being sent a replacement phone, if this one does not have that problem I'd give the phone 5 stars. But to have a phone that does everything except work as phone is ridiculous.Discovered the problem: Firmware version 2.54 is very buggy. The most recent (3.12) should be fine. You can check what version you have by pressing *#0000# in standby mode."
4,Nokia Redeems Themselves,"After leaving my Nokia Phones behind lastyear when i got a Sony Ericsson T68i, I have finally decided to come back to Nokia and give them a try. The Nokia 3650 is an amazing phone. The built in bluetooth alone was what drew me to it. However, my old Ericsson HBH-15 headset will need to be replaced as the Nokia only works with teh Ericsson HBH-60 and Nokia headsets. The screen size and colors is another beautiful thing abotu this phone. Browsing on WAP (T-Zones Internet) is simply amazing with this phone. No more scrolling and it is fast too. The built in Camera and Video Recorder are a nice addition too but still not ready to replace my real digital camera. It's fun to be bale to snap a quick picture and then send it to a friend to get advice or just say hello. As for the keypad, it is awkward at first but aftera few days, it becomes comfortable to use and makes text messaging a breeze. nokia has finally redeemed themselves to me with this phone."
2,"with all that I know, I would not do it again","I got this phone when it first came out. I was extremely happy with it. The games were great and the screen was the best I had ever seen. One month passes by, my phone will no longer turn on. It took Nokia six weeks to fix the phone. It was gone longer than I had it. All was well again and now I was on a trip. In the middle of the mountain terrain my screen starts fading. All of the sudden it starting turning on and off, over and over again. Now I have to call Nokia and send it in again. I am fixing to switch back to trustworthy Samsung. Unless you are getting it absolutely free don't waste your time or money."
2,Great Phone - Inaudible tones,"Look, this phone is great, it has a fun quality to it. It takes great little photos for a phone, the video function is really fun too. But I've already had to exchange it once. There is a definite bug with the loudness of the rings. While setting the tone in the profile section, I play it at the loudest level, which isn't even loud enough. After setting this profile, and someone calls, the phone barely rings!! Two of the 3650s have done this to me. If you use this phone for business, you better get something else, cause you're gonna miss lots of calls."
4,I love this phone!,"The phone is bigger than most cell phones, but that's one of the reasons I wanted it.Those tiny phones may be fine for some but I needed something that wouldn't get lost in my handbag. I like all the features, although I don't use most of them on a daily basis. The camera is nice to have, although not a replacement for a quality digital camera but its nice to text message a vacation pic. I've had my phone for 14 months and have not had any serious issues with it. It;s very easy to find accessories and downloads are a breeze for ringtones, etc. Though a little pricey, I find it worth every penny."
2,amazon,"So, it has been 29 days since I placed the order. Still have not gotten the phone. I wish I could rate the phone but I can't.But amazon.com sucks. really sucks. But just in case, you still purchase throught this site, remember to check your 'spam'? mail. After they send you the initial purchase order email, they also send you one that tell you to contact the plan servers. The second email can get lost, and that is cause of the delay."
4,pretty good phone,"I've had this phone since july. The features are pretty cool. the reception is good in most places except lower levels like a basement. everyone thinks its a cool looking phone, even though it is a little bigger than most phones. the round dialing pad is easy getting used to. and i use the camera often because i can transfer the pictures via infared to my laptop."
2,disappointing,"This phone looks great in the description; it has loads of cool features. However, the picture quality is really pitiful- you almost can't tell what you have taken a picture of. Also, it is too large to fit in any purse cell phone pockets or holders- it is really huge. Another thing is the buttons are very hard to use. I just returned mine and am shopping for another one!"
3,Never got my phone,"I thought this would be a great phone--I ordered it and a matching T-Mobile plan based on the recommendations on this page. I waited over 2 month for it, and an Errikson T616 to arrive but they did not. Amazon notified me there were errors in my application. It tried fixing them--twice. I awaited my phones and equipment, but nothing happened. Amazon failed to notify me in a timely way that there were problems. The end result--I'm without my phones and my order was cancelled. I cannot believe being treated so poorly."
5,Superb product for the price,"For the first time I feel like I have a functional ""all-in-one"" device. The phone is great as a normal GSM 3-band phone, and it has a good radio. In the elevator where I used to lose the signal on a Nokia 8890, this phone has a strong signal. The blutooth connection with PC Suite syncs my contacts, calendar & to-do list with my Outlook automatically, with no messy wires. I can access my office email seamlessly (it's on an Exchange Server). I even downloaded an Opera browser and I can now access the web, which is convenient when commuting to work on the train. I use the bluetooth to also attach to a wireless Jabra earpiece, which is cheap and more for speaking when driving or walking than a wire earpiece. My mobile experience took a great leap forward with this phone."
1,hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it hate,REally really hate it. I bought this phone in May of 2003. In June I sent it in to be repaired. Got the phone back in October only to have the phone die on me again in December. Sent the phone back in. This time they sent me a new phone. Guess what? It is broken too. I really wish that I would never have spent my money on this piece of junk. From now on I will stick with Samsung.PS would have given it a negative number of stars but not an option
2,Circular touch pad? You've got to be kidding,"I was an early adopter of this phone. It was one of the first phones to ship with Bluetooth and a built-in camera.I can't wait for a few more months to go by so I can justify getting rid of it.DISLIKES:1. Circular touch pad. What a poor idea. You will never get used to it, I predict. I have never found it intuitive. It always slows down dialing.2. Too big to carry comfortably in the pocket.3. Operating system requires too many steps and is not always intuitive.4. Resolution of camera is poor, and lighting/shakiness is terrible in low light.LIKES:1. Bluetooth2. Large size is better for holding and speaking, more like a home phone.3. Speaker phone is really handy, and is loud.Make me an offer, I would love to get rid of it! The people at Nokia who thought up the circular phone pad should be required to use it for the next 10 years."
2,"So much potential, but so darn big","They were still a hassle.It was my first cell phone, so I was quite happy with the voice quality, nice screen and wealth of features.Then I lost the phone on a trip. I wish I'd had phone insurance. This time, I got a Sony Ericsson T610 as a replacement.I am so much happier with the new phone. It has made me realise all the weaknesses of the 3650, which include:- it's far too large- it uses up battery way too quickly (I was charging every second night, if not every night)- did I mention that it's far too large?In the end, I have no idea why it's so big, and the battery life is relatively poor. I'm glad I made the switch."
3,"Good Phone, but weak ring & speaker!!!","I recently purchsed this phone and the truth is i can barely hear the ring tone. I have missed several important calls because of this. I have increased the volume to max, still of no use. The speaker also has got very low volumne. Camera feature is good but the pic comes out pretty dull."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Hello! I recently purchased this phone directly from T-Mobile and it's aweful! My sister has one as well and they in fact, do shut off ""automatically"". I've had the phone exchanged 4 times, my sister 5 and they have all had that problem. Customer service sucks and they are trying to charge me 300$ if I want a new phone from a different brand. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Needs repair twice in three months!,"The phone works fine when it is functional; however, the product is very cheapily made and extremely fragile. Moreover, it oftenly turns itself off. Twice in three months, it just would not start again after it ""automatically"" shuts down. When the phone works, it's a beautiful little gadget, but for half the time I owned it, it was sitting in the repair shop."
4,1 1/4 in Andis Universal Comb,"Several years ago, I purchased the Andis ProPet clipper to clip my cockapoo. The large universal comb, paired with a standard 1/8"" stainless Andis clipper blade, provides a smooth, even cut every time. The clipper comb is a nice alternative to purchasing a much more expensive single blade, and for approximately $30 less than a similar blade, it's well worth the money.Pro's:--Extremely inexpensive--Metal hinge adjusts to fit clipper head--Comb adjusts to a snug, secure fit on the clipper--Provides an even, smooth cut every timeCon's:--The comb has wide teeth, but it is plastic. If you have a curly-haired dog, you'll need to comb out any snarls before grooming."
1,Does not fit Masters.,Bought this for Andis Masters. It has a cheesy and annoying spring load deal and two wrongly distanced hooks that don't fit the Andis Masters.
1,pc users - beware!,"apparently my 2000 dell 1 ghz pc is too obsolete for this thing, luckily amazon has great customer service and processed my return right away.the apple site and product descriptions are misleading...they note that pc's with usb 1.01 or 2.0 are compatible; however, nowhere does it say if you have usb 1.01 (like me) you need to buy an additional usb card for $100 or if you have usb 2.0 you need to buy the cable for $20 to make the ipod compatible.i have to say, though, i was very impressed by the design of the ipod when i opened the box... but not enough for me to go out and buy an apple."
2,There's better for PC users.,"If you're a Mac user, this is a great product. It works wonderfully.However, if you're a PC user, there are better products to use. I'll give it to Apple; the design of this product and the very intuitive UI are very strong points. In fact, those were what won me over in the first place. I brought it home, and tried to get it to work for several hours (8-10) without progress. I kept getting errors, and eventually called Apple's tech support, which were VERY professional and helpful. Turns out, though, that the iPod didn't work with my firewire card. So I bought the one they recommended, and still ran into problems. So I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for the Creative Zen, 20 GB USB 2.0 version, and it's way better. The sound has less noise, the battery life is almost DOUBLE the iPod's, and has almost all the features of the iPod (it's also got more space).So, in short, for PC users, the Creative Zens are so much better, if a little more lacking in style."
4,"Paperweights, anyone?","After researching both the new iPods and the Zen, I'm struck by the fact that neither have replaceable Li-ion batteries. They are indeed rechargeable, but since Li-ion technology dictates that the battery can survive only 350-400 discharge/recharge cycles (afterwhich it becomes totally unchargeable), both the iPod and Zen are destined to be paperweights in 18 to 24 months, granted that lifetime depends on use. Li-ion batteries begin to lose charge capacity after 200 charge cycles, meaning that neither player will be able to hold a full charge once that point is passed--something sure to limit playtime. Neither Apple nor Creative tech support were willing to ensure that their companies would be willing to replace the Li-ion battery, even if it were possible (the iPod's battery is not replaceable, period.)."
5,Simple,"I previously kept all of my music on Minidisc because I wanted something small that could change music quickly. Now the iPod is small enough and holds ALL of my music, plus it's very easy to use. I'm using mine on a mac with the new iTunes music store which really makes purchasing music quick and easy. Finally, the mac version supports the new mp4(AAC) format for small, high-quality music."
1,Broke in 1 week and a 10% fee to return from Apple,Locked up and overheated. The Apple store had great difficulty trying to reset my Ipod - after many tries - it finally reset. They charged me a 10% restocking fee to return it- since they were able to reset the ipod. I could tell it was defective. I have always stayed away from Apple as a PC owner. They have always abused their customers dating back to the earliest Macs with the motherboard scandals. If one owns a Apple computer - they 'got you' like in th old days of the PC. It is like owning an exotic car - it just has to look good - whether or not it works is not really important. It is the style that matters!
1,Windows perspective,"Like my ex-wife, the iPod for Windows is beautiful and doesn't work. Needless to say, this is a recipe for extreme frustration, and I can only warn Windows users to resist the siren song at least until Apple addresses several problems. Chief among them is the iPod's inability to remember it's been charged. Consequently, it has a functional battery life of as little as 10 minutes, after which it must be recharged for several hours (assuming it doesn't become entirely unresponsive for 24 hours or more). This problem, in varying degrees, has afflicted each of the half-dozen Windows-iPod victims I know. Conclusion: don't get an iPod unless you have a Mac."
1,Terrible on Windows,"I Have a good 6-8 hours of effort into getting my brand new 15gb windows ipod to just have a playlsit work. The included MusicMatch software for PC is basically totally broken (and this is confirmed by numerous posts on sites like ipodlounge.com). The standard advice is to go buy another program like xplay since the included software from Apple doesn't work. The problem with the third party programs is that most haven't been updated to work with the latest crop of ipods. ANyway its a joke to pay $400 for an mp3 player and have to then shell out another $30 for software just to put songs on it. Not sure if this is apple's way of suggesting that everyone buy a mac or just their incompetence with the platform, but if you are a PC users I suggest looking elsewhere. I am very disappointed and am returning mine.-H"
1,Does not work with PC well,"Don't believe the hype. It is a great player and you so much want to love it, but it freezes all the time and crashes my PC."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,For the cost it is horrible. If you want a good mp3 play that will hold 5000 mp3s then check out the Rio Karma. It is a much better mp3 company and is a lot more reliable with windows computers. If you own a Mac (i feel sorry for you) then it is a great mp3 player to own. Also I dont really see the point in owning a player that holds 5000 songs unless it is the Phat Noise/Kenwood Music Keg.
1,WARNING!!!...if you have a PC.,"Don't be fooled by Apple's assurances that their new IPod will work with a PC. It won't. Yes, there is supplementary software, and a Firewire attachment. But when you hook the whole thing up, the chances are it won't work..."
5,Revolutionary,"Wow. My 15GB iPod has got to be the greatest invention since the LP. Mine currently holds a couple hundred hours of music with plenty of room to spare for more. This means that I take my entire CD collection to work with me every day -- and it weighs just ounces. I find I can typically get about four hours of use out of the battery, but I've also recently taken to plugging my iPod into its base station (on AC) and plugging that into my stereo via a Monster cable. I may donate my CD changer to Goodwill before the year is out."
3,"Great Concept, but with bugs","I absolutely had to ahve an iPod when I saw an ad for it - it can store up to 3500 songs, great sound quality, easy to use. So I went out and bought one, but the main thing I dislike about it are the touch-buttons. They do not always work, especially if you ahve left it sitting idle for even 2 days, and put it on HOLD mode. Then when you release the HOLD button and try to turn it on, it doesn't turn on.It has a reboot function, where you hold the two middle buttons down at the same time, and it is supposed to reboot and the apple symbol comes on. But now even THAT doesn't work.SO I am sitting with a gorgeous new toy which I cannot switch on to use. Very frustrating indeed. Anyone who has any ideas please let me know."
5,Has to be alien technology!,"Apple has out done itself on form and function once again! I have never been a fan of the Apple format, but the ipod tempted me into purchasing an Apple product. The only drawback was the MusicMatch Jukebox software that handles windows based PCs. After many, many problems ... I ... downloaded ephpod (freeware) to handle the uploading of my music files to the ipod and never had another problem. Hurray ipod and freeware (now I have one more device I can't live without)."
1,"Good idea, but bad execution.","I bought an Ipod because I wanted the space and the small size. While it was small, and spacious, it was impossible to use. Doing anything on it is overcomplicated. Putting on multiple playlists is damn near impossible. I would recommend just buying an MP3 cd player and change cd's every once and awhile. Because the Ipod is too damn hard to use to be useful."
1,WHITAKER IS A QUACK!,"Dr. Whitaker is nothing but a quack! My mother has been following his regimen for years to help treat her rhuematoid arthritis and other ailments, but we discovered that the vitamins that he produces are dangerous! My mother took a daily dose (her first one) of the vision-helping vitamins and proceeding to throw up blood for several hours! I don't know who this guy thinks he is, but he is certainly not one to be trusted!"
4,This is NOT a Book!,"This is simply a map of Australia and a good one. With all of the interest in Australia due to the Olympics, it is helpful to be able to locate the places frequently refered to in the media. Easy to read with some city center maps. Good legend. Thanks!"
1,trash,"i bought this book thinking it would give some valuable info on the prophet .this book is trash. this author is a joke. first off starting with his name keith moore 32mason..from that alone u know hes not part of msta just a on looker from sideline .he wouldhave bey or elif he was .2nd he doesnt proclaim his nationality but only gives u his degree n masonary.letting u know off hand whos side hes on..another thing this guy is kinda slick with his writings ,even though well educated hes a fool.he actually belives morrish science comes out of masonary. U WRONG...its other way around. (egyptians) and moors are same people .dont forget you are who your ancestors are.ancient moabites. not what SOME EUROPEANS CALL U (EGYPTIANS)...FOREFATHERS NAME YOU NOT THE LAND YOU LIVE IN.IF A SO CALLED BLACK MAN IS BORNN JAPAN.WHATS HE CALLED? JAPANESE .......BUT WHAT IS HE ? HES A MOABITE THAT LIVES N JAPAN.....PRAISE ALLAH AND HIS PROPHET NOBLE DREW ALI"
3,hydrant statue,I liked the statue but it arrived broken in many pieces. I was able to glue the top pieces back together so to be usable. I have read other reviews where this has happened .The shipping package looked like a gorrilla had a go with it . Very thin cardboard with very little foam packing. This is how they keep the low price?
3,Cute Yard Decor!,"I purchase this hoping my male miniature pincher would enjoy this, however, he did not get the idea and went everywhere else. Still a cute item to decorate the yard."
2,Who says this actually works?,"Read glowing reviews about this product so I bought 2! Well...my male chihuahua, in the beginning, didn't even to bother to sniff either one. Then weeks later, after I had wiped female urine from a friend's dog on them, he finally did lift his leg on one - ignored the other, and could care less.This might work for some folks' dogs - but the hype that convinced me to buy, for me, was just that- hype!"
3,Fire Hydrant for Dog,"Really cute for our Chihuahua, he loves it, however it was broken when we received it. There were none to replace it so we had to mend it, instead of returning it. Had to pay full price for something that was not in mint condition."
1,Received it broken,"The top of this hydrant was broken when I received it. I did get a refund but as I have mentioned before, where is product control with them items that are defective."
3,Dog Fire Hydrant Yard statue,item smaller than expected. More of a decorative item than a doggie relief station. Next time I will get out the ruler .
3,OK....but didn't realize it was ceramic (thought it would be metal or hard plastic),"Came timely and in good condition. But, base piece broke within a day or two (someone leaned on it) and then the dog knocked it over and broke it in half after a week. Looked great though while it lasted."
2,Cute but easily breakable:(,Cute but easlily breakable and too expensive for what you get. I couldn't get my dogs to pee on it either:( Now it's just a yard decoration.
1,Poor Packaging,"I purchased this item, it looked good, but due to poor packaging the item was broken. I immediately sent it back, and re-ordered a new one. The second one came broken worse than the first. Very disappointed!!!"
2,Broken pieces,Excited to open the box just to see the broken pieces. The packaging was no way near to be adequate. Had no choice but return it.
3,Not for a dog...,"It lasted 45 min before my dog started to play with it and when he dropped it broke in a 1000 pieces...the hydrant is pretty, but if you want it for a dog to pee on it, be careful, he may prefer to play with it."
3,Didn't work out for me,"We bought this for a patch of grass in the back yard where our dog will go..thinking it would be funny. It said ""outdoor"", but it broke down after a couple of months and we had to remove it. It basically just broke off from the base. Maybe it will last better shielded from the elements outside, I don't know. We were happy with it initially though (as far as the looks of it)."
2,Nice Looking Item - but arrived broken,Shame. The item looked nicely made but it arrived in 3 pieces. Packaging didn't appear to be very robust. I sent the item back and was credited.
5,high quality product; my dog uses this to pee on,"this is really cute, and did exceed my expectations in terms of the look. Does not look cheap at all, and everyone thought it was cute. I put this in my yard as my dog is a male and prefers to pee on something. He did go straight for this and for the most part uses this all the time."
2,Ok item... Good for puppies!,Is kind of small and made of hard plastic. Shipping is very costly. I would rather buy metal one instead for this same price..
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this hydrant some months ago. It arrived very quickly and all in one piece. I was instantly disappointed as it did not look at all like the picture online. It was a darker shade of red and didn't look quite as wide as the one pictured. However, it was cute so I placed it in my front yard and loved how it looked. The dogs totally ignored it but I did enjoy looking at it until recently when all the paint started to chip off. Now I have a red/white speckled hydrant and am having to replace it. :(I will definitely NOT reorder this item."
4,Cute ornament,"I got this for my backyard to try to get my dog to pee in one spot instead of all over my plants...let me just say it feels weird to buy something for your dog to pee on. My dog is 60 pounds, probably about 24-26"" at the shoulder, and this thing is just too short for him to be interested in. It's a cute lawn ornament though, and is a funny thing to have in the backyard...maybe someday he'll take to it. I'd recommend for people with shorter dogs."
2,damaged!,"i am not rating this on looks or functionality. i received this today and it was in several pieces. However, due to amazon's poor return service, I am not returning for fear they will give me a partial refund as always. so, now that all but one of my fingers has superglue all over it, i still realize it is missing pieces which are not in the box or package. to me that means it was damaged before i got it. well, i guess i will have to use some molding clay on the bottom and repaint it. luckily i have some artistic ability or i would have a almost $40 loss. upset i have to spend my time doing this now!"
5,A rare gift,"This is an exceptionally rare and precious teaching from a teacher with ""true grit."" Worth repeated listening and contemplation."
2,Disappointing,"This turned out to be the most superficial journey into this subject I have ever seen. In fact, I've never experienced anything even remotely as shallow. I was duped by her seemingly good credentials, the deceptively extensive menu of subjects and the positive reviews into buying this sight unseen and found nothing but coffee table conversation-level insights, at least among the people with whom I associate. I thought I'd keep listening anyway, in case I ended up with a small storehouse to work with. But to get those insights, you have to sit through her droning voice as she skates across the surface until she sees fit to drop these underwhelming nuggets. Unless perhaps you are coming from another religion and have no knowledge of Eastern archetypes, I cannot recommend this. It could have been published in a much shorter form and probably better done on paper."
2,Disappointing,Sorry everybody I really really wanted to like this but it just didn't work for me. I am a fan of the original Kamen Rider series and this seemed to be missing the fun of it. Maybe because it was just an updated retelling of the original story but darker for the modern audience. The making of stuff on the disc I found way more interesting than the actual movie.
4,Oh Hell Yes!,"I saw this film on Youtube a while ago(I have it bookmarked), and the subtitles are iffy and the quality is on the 50/50 side, but never the less, it rocked. The acting was good, the action was amazing, the designs were incredible, and the script mixed in old elements with a new feel.This film is not even close to ""Ultraman The Next"" impressiveness(which is up there with Spiderman and X2 as one of the best superhero movies ever made), but it is still great entertainment. Honesly, you don't even need to like KR to enjoy this film."
1,wrong audience,"Somehow I thought this book would be for adults. Imagine my surprise when it turns out to be a picture book written at a child's level. What a disappointment. I had expected to learn about the life of the man that ""inspired"" Pie in the Sky."
2,God is Red? I don't think so.,"I really did not care for this book.The Author uses quotes to push his anti-""christian"" agenda.I too have a bias against ""christianity"" because of the way I was treated by *some* ""christians"".I will never take the ""christian"" path; but I have no right to influence other people to take a path I follow, or to try to persuade you NOT to take a specific path because I have a strong dislike for it.If ""christianity"" works for you; Fine. I suggest for people to explore different paths and follow the one that answers more of your spiritual questions.The entire reason for a spiritual practise is to get in touch with the creative force whether you call it God, the Great Spirit, Jehovah, Sugmad, the Source, Universe, etc. Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
3,Awful customer service when a repair was requested,"I have had my phone for almost 3 years with no problems. When we moved, I plugged it in and noticed the phone did not ring and the answering machine wouldn't pick up. I called Uniden (after going through ALL the troubleshooting steps) and they apparently did away with their service department. When I told the representative that I simply wanted a repair, she said that these phones were not built to be repaired and I would have to buy a new one since ""they were so cheap"". Nice! I will never buy from them again. I feel that this company could do a better job with corporate responsibility towards the environment."
5,great system!,"No problems at all with this unit, very durable, easy to use, I can even call in and check my messages away from home. This was the most affordable option I was interested in and it is a very good product. I highly recommend this phone system."
5,A hidden treasure!,"This phone system is awesome!!! It's a hidden treasure. It's got way more features than I expected. Not only is it an expandable cordless phone system that allows you to put a phone in any room with an electrical outlet, but it's got a lot of neat features. You name each phone with the name of the room it's in. One phone can call another individual phone. Each phone has several ringers to choose from. You can transfer your address information and saved numbers to one or all of the other extensions. You can even take two phones with you out of the house and use them as walkie talkies when you're out shopping or whatever. These are just a few of the cool features this phone system has. It's easy to use. This is a really great phone system and worth every penny. I purchased the additional handset which put my system at the maximum 4-phone capacity. If you like gadgets, you'll love this phone system!!!"
4,better than most,"For a feature-rich, three-room cordless phone set, it is a great value. Sound quality on the handsets is OK. Sound quality on the voice message playback at the base station is not that great. I have experienced crosstalk with what must be other units in my area. Also, the handsets are pretty small and the buttons are tiny. But hey, they're convenient, work fine, and are at a good price point."
5,Even my two year old hasn't broken this yet!,"My husband purchased this phone over two years ago. Since then, it has been abused by my two year old and my husbands laziness (he forgets to put the phone back on the receiver to recharge). The battery life, however, is fabulous! I have left it off the receiver overnight and there was still have the battery minimum left.Also, the phone is heavy duty enough to withstand numerous tumbles into our marble kitchen floors. The speakphone function is now something I cannot live without - especially when cooking or washing the dishes. The clarity is excellent, and I have never heard static on this phone. There are distinct phone ringing options so where Grandma calls, I can tell who is calling without looking at the phone's caller ID.Another great thing is that it doesnt need extra wiring for additional handsets! Just plug in any room and you have a working phone! I highly recommend this phone.. I still love it!"
5,Best Phone I've Ever Owned,"This is truely a great Telephone system. It does everything it is advertised to do, and it is very user friendly - easy to use."
5,"Great phones, work with 802.11g","Having a Cordless 2.4ghz phone that worked with my wireless network was a main concern to me. My old Uniden, which was rated a top phone by CR, would kill my laptop connection every time I answered it. These Uniden phones, (2.4ghz dss, vs. 2.4analog) work great, sound great, and don't bump me off of my wireless network. On top of that, they are about 2/3 the size of standard cordless phones, lighter, and have more features, including multiple ringtones. They are also very clear, compared to other cordless phones. The only downside to these I have found so far is the limited battery time. The cells are AAA NiMh rechargeables in a pack, as opposed to AA NiMh cells, which hold substantially more charge. But other than that, the phones are great. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat."
5,Great home phone system.,"I have a 3 room house with two rooms with no phone jack. With this system, I was able to put a handset in those rooms without having to buy 50ft extension phonelines. The intercom system with customizable labels for the phone LCD screen is easy to use. I even taught my parents who don't know how to use technology at all.The phones are small, the rings are loud and customizable. There are a lot of ringtones for you to choose.I use to have a sony and pansonic phone but these phones were purchased a decade ago and I finally decided to just replace it all and I haven't regret it since I got it."
2,Battery issues,I love this product for all the same reasons everyone else recommends in their reviews except for one very important thing. The batteries suck. I have had this phone for a little over a month and already one of the phone's batteries is completely drained and another is on its way. I did charge the handsets for the recommended period before using them so that is not the problem. Here's the kicker I went on Uniden's website to order another battery and of course they are backordered and I have to get in line and pay them to secure my ordering position. What a bunch of garbage. These are solid phones but the battery problem is unacceptable.
2,Ok phone....,"I have had a few Uniden phones in the past and this one started out great. After about 9 month it started to cutout. To me it was like I was talking to someone on a cell phone and the signel was hit/miss...then I was on the other end of the phone call. I could hear my wife (on this Uniden phone system) just fine, but she could not hear me more then half the time.We tried moving the phone to other phone jacks, reseting it, even taking it to another house and trying it there...it was no use, the phone base was a goner.I did take the actual phone and program it to my family's base (as they have the same system) and the phone itself seemed to work fine then. So it must be something with the base and the incoming signal.About a month later the same then happened with my sisters phone system and then my parents....3 phone systems...all 3 dead...Dont waste your money on ""this"" system."
3,distance,The handsets get static within 8' from the base. The distance however is about 200' along with increased static
3,They knock me off my wireless internet!!!!grrrrrrrrrr!!!,They are great phones BUT if you have wireless and the phone rings...bet your money it is going to kick you off EVERYTIME!!! A friend reccomended the 5.8ghz in phones...they will not interfere with your internet. Good luck!
2,Uniden 2.4 GHz,"Ehhh...so so.The 3 units are nice, the walkie talkie take to the beach is nice and locate a unit from another is nice. But the quality is so so.The answering machine is muffled and difficult to understand many messages. Same for outgoing message. batteries don't hold up long enough either. Wish I'd purchased a different system."
4,Good phone for Price,"worth it. It works great in my house. although someime international call is in wavy but that may be due to phone company issue. Different ligting would have bette view (blue may be?) over all good product, no problem so far. Easy setting and use."
1,Warning to wireless network users!!,If you're running 802.11 a/b/g anywhere near these phones you will get nothing but static. Amazon graciously accepted the return and I ordered Panasonic 5.8 ghz phones (through Amazon of course) which work wonderfully and DO NOT pick up any static from the home wireless network/router.
2,Inconsistent Quality,"Phone worked fine initially, then one unit went out - could hear, but could not speak. Another phone had inconsistent sound quality and faded in/out.Use manual did not address the issues. Calls to support revealed complex reset processes not included in the manual. Two hours later we had all phones working well again.Then they went out again this week with similar problems, plus no dial tone.Additional call to Uniden and they are sending a replacement set to us."
5,Love my Uniden DCT648-3,"I love the Uniden DCT648-3. IT has 3 headsets that are small like a cell phone. I have a small hearing problem and I can hear extremely well on these phones and that was one very important thing to me. Anyone with kids or noisy spouses, will love this phone. You can hear in spite of them. I live on 3 acres and have not tried taking it too far but inside the metal barn and I still have no problem. I love it has a battery meter on the handset and you can change ringtones per phone or person in your phonebook. You can transfer your phonebook to all phones and only enter into one phone. Also being able to check your messages from any of the phones is a great help. Answering machine is very clear to the caller and the recordings are very clear. I just love the phone(s)"
5,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR & MORE!!!!,"I BOUGHT THE UNIDEN DCT648-3 2.4 GHz 3 HANDSET PHONE SYSTEM & I WAS REALY ONLY LOOKING FOR A PHONE THAT HAD A GOOD CLEAR SPEAKER PHONE. YOU CAN SET THIS PHONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM & THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH WHOEVER IS ON THE PHONE & HEAR EVERY WORD!!! IT HAS SO MANY FEATURES, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE!!! ALSO, WHOEVER DESIGNED THIS PHONE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE CONSUMER. EVERY FEATURE IS EASY TO FIGURE OUT. YOU ALMOST DON'T NEED THE MANUAL. THANK YOU FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!"
5,Great value!,"I have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items I use vanilla beans for. One recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe! One can image how expensive that would be at $4 - $6 per bean! This Melissa's box was an incredible buy at just over $1 per bean...the beans are supple and their flavor is very good. As another reviewer mentioned, they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent! I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with. I don't know how long they will remain fresh because I haven't had that issue, but as quickly as I use them, I don't expect to. This is a tremendous value!!"
5,Great,"Works just like it should for aquariums, line is flexible but does not kink easily. forms a tight seal on connections and does not harden over time."
4,Tube for aquarium,I didn't like the color. It was blue. I was supprised that it was not clear as most tubing is.
1,I have bought 7 and only 2 work,Air only comes out of a small part of the stone. I have bought 7 of these and only 2 work. Sucky product!!
5,YAY!!!,"Finally, I was able to find silicone tubing for my tanks. The flexibility is such much easier to work with than the traditional plastic tubing. I found algea does not seem to grow on it like traditional plastic tubing. Very happy to find this silicone airline tubing on Amazon."
3,"Okay, but...","This is a decent overview of the area. I found, however, that when it came to actually visiting the areas mentioned, there was little for the traveler that wasn't easily obtained simply by DOING it rather than reading about it here."
1,Leaks Propane,"Our Boy Scout Troop had purchased 3 of these propane trees. Two of them developed leaks at the main valve stem. In order for these not to leak, we could not tighten the stabilizer screws that laterally support the tree. Putting a lantern at the top can lead to possible swinging and breakage of the lantern."
1,"texsport 30"" Propane tree",I purchases this item to connect with my colman propane lamp and a stove .the lantern does not draw gas because the stem on the lantern does not open the gas flow. Mabe there is somthing wrong with the tree. becuase the lantern works with the small green propane tanks. flows two the lowerconections but not the top one.
2,unoriginal,"I usually like books by Indian authors, but this one was truly a waste of time.It was sort of a hodge-podge of other books (some 'Like Water for Chocolate', some 'God of Small Things', etc.) with an unoriginal plot, some nice ends to tie up that showed up from nowhere. It's fine to read a not-so-great book if at least the language has some poetry or beauty in it; this one does not. It read like I was listening in on someone's dull cell phone conversation. Apparently this author has some previous books that were successful, but I'm not likely to read anything else by her."
1,Thank you for the warning,"I was so excited to see that these novelas were on dvd now. As I read all the reviews I was informed that they are not the complete novelas. I'm so disappointed. I will not be buying these dvd's thanks to the reviews. I would rather wait and hopefully get to see the day when we can have the whole novelas on dvd, even if it has to be a two or three dvd box set. They are well worth it. Until then I will keep my fond childhood memories of them and keep hoping. Thank you all for taking the time to do the reviews. I hope someone in Televisa can get their heads together and make this happen."
2,Meh,"Just can't seem to get into this one. The music is weird and... I don't know, disjointed somehow. Like a bunch of bits and pieces thrown together. The vocals aren't all that great either. Disappointing, I really enjoy Horror Grandeur and All Dead Here."
5,Great Product!,"This stand is everything it advertises to be. Light weight, durable and it elevates my PowerBook to good typing and viewing levels. My laptop runs cooler with all the air flowing around it with this Visidec stand. I was able to transport it in my carry on without loss of space. Slid right in amongst my papers. Great Product!"
1,"Static, okay in small part of the house","This phone has terrible static in most places regardless of channelchange. It also had many dead spots. Okay near the base. Whyget a cordless phone??? Okay we do have wireless internet,but the more expensive 5.8GHz is not suppose to interfere with this.Worst cordless phone I ever purchased. In fact, soon to be returned!"
1,Awful sound quality,The volume is so low on this phone it's almost unusable. The earpiece makes everybody sound like they're wispering.
4,I like this phone,"I am surprised by the negative reviews. I have this phone and two other brand cordless. This is my favorite because it's comfortable. I work from home and spend lots of time on the phone. The only thing missing is the speakerphone capability -that's why I'm replacing it. But looking for one that's this comfortable next to your ear. Works well, never had a problem."
4,Fooled even my skeptic sister-in-law!,"SVAT ISC200 Outdoor Imitation Security Camera with Blinking LEDEasy to install and looks like the real thing! If my skepic sister-in-law thinks it's real, hopefully any shady characters in my neighborhood will too!"
3,Limitations,The problem with this camera is that there is no option for a wired power supply. A battery running out in 2 months is inadequate especially when mounted high up in a rather inaccessible location. Who want's to go up there and change batteries every 2 months?
2,The light stopped blinking after three days,"The light stays on constantly, which I feel makes it less of a deterent."
4,security camera,a very good item that serves its purpose well and i recommend it to others if they are looking for this type of camera
3,Very authentic,Very pleased with the outward appearance of this product looking like the real thing. My only criticism was that access to the battery compartment is rather inconvenient once the camera has been mounted. I modified it so that this compartment was wired remotely so that I can replace the batteries with ease when needed
1,Never In Stock!,"Ordered mine on 19 March, never in stock and now I receive a notice that it might ship between 22 Jun to sometime in July. The online page says they're in stock...don't believe it. I just cancelled and will look elsewhere. Amazon should drop these bums."
4,They look convincing,"Installed quick, and they look quite real, even from close up. The client was happy, and so i'm happy. Would be nice if you could hard wire the led, but it is battery powered only."
3,Looks pretty real,"We bought several of these cameras to mount around our condo complex for increased security. They do look fairly real. My only question is how long does the battery last that keeps the little red light flashing -- we haven't had them long enough to know yet. One of the cameras was broken when we received it, but amazon sent out a replacement immediately."
4,Does the job,Augmented our real security cameras with this one. People noticed. It appears very real.
2,10X mirror,The mirror came with a small dent. I sent it back and they sent another one to me with a larger dent and a small crack. I kept it because I needed it.
4,Best yet,"My first PDA was a Palm Pilot Pro. Getting it to backup/sync with my main computer was a chore. Entering data was not easy. It was slow, even with added RAM. Then I got a Casio E-10. Faster. It easily synced with MS Outlook. The IR feature worked great with my portable. Just turn both on, point the IRs at each other and, seconds later, all done. No cradle needed (although one was included). Easy to enter data using virtual keyboard or hand printing (no special characters like Palm's Jot). But visibility in bright daylight was bad. E-105 solves that problem and has 32MB of RAM to upload Expedia Maps. Of course, the 56K color screen garners lots of attention when I pop it out in meetings! And it's faster still. Still tastes like human poop though."
3,thinkin about switchin,"I have a palm V, and I am seriously considering switching over- It would be nice have 100MBs, music, voice recorder etc... Its just that the thing looks so big- not exactly wallet sized."
2,Dont expect too much,HP made a pretty decent product but dotn expect too much for your money. Inother words dont expect an upside surprise. Im not all too impressed.
5,Best Windows CE Device So Far!,"The HP Jornada 430 SE is simply the greatest Win CE device that has ever been made. It has an excellent combination of features that make it a must-buy, despite its price tag. The MP3 decoder is great, and so are the voice-activated contacts and photo applications. I have not had any problems with my unit and synchronization is a breeze with MS ActiveSync! It's a great product for all those times that you want access to your information, and want to play a little, too - without having to pull out your laptop! Good job HP!"
2,Review for the Jornada 420,"The Jornada 420, which I am sure is similar to the new 430, is a decent product. It is somewhat bigger than the PPilot (a little big to fit in your pocket), but has some great features. Color display, voice recordings and Window CE are very handy.Again, this review is for the 420- support is poor at best. I have a persistent problem that makes me ""reboot"" the machine. It frequently locks-up on me and this reboot is required. Most of the time I do not loose any data, sometimes I have to set-up the machine again and download all my information (which is fairly simple, just time consuming). I have talked to support on a few occasions, and the last time - the gentlemen I spoke with actually said, ""Are you being dense on purpose""? Can you believe that? He must not have read the HP Way.So in all, color display is great, the features are helpful and if the 430 has been improved over the 420 and once they iron out all of the bugs, the Jornada series will be a fine product."
1,tired of re-loading,"Nice looking, Beautiful color screen, easy to use, yet my 430 continues to shut down and not start up. I've tried soft start, hard start, I'm ready to start the thing on fire. My 430 is less than 6 months old. Very unreliable!"
2,Not as cool as the Casio E-100/105!,"Fairly interesting device, but I would also suggest taking a look at the Casio E-100/105, which has better buttons and (with the 105) 32M of memory. WinCE in general certainly has quirks, but it's nice to have the ability to listen to stereo MP3 and watch short videos on these color WinCE units."
2,Headset Review,"This particular Bluetooth headset did not work very well with my LG Fusic. Whenever I would turn my head, the signal would constantly cut out. I placed the phone in my pants pocket, around my arm, and even a foot in front of my face. Maybe it would synch better with a different phone. The retractable cord did work well though. The headset is also a very convenient travel size. They secured themselves around my ear pretty well and I did not feel they were too big."
5,Great BT Headphones!,"I just received this product in the mail and I have to say, they are great! I bought this intending on using it with my Samsung YP-P2 MP3 Player and it works like a charm. I also tested this headphone with my cell phone and it's really 50/50 depending on where you carry your phone. But in the end if you intend on using these heavily for cellphones then I suggest you to look elsewhere. If your intending on using it for MP3 players I say look no further! Sound is not outstanding but it isn't awful either. I say the sound is pretty much equal to just about any off the shelf headphones under $40 that sony or any other manufacturer makes. I have nothing else to say than this is a great product and it's def the way to go if your looking say bye bye to wired earbuds or headphones."
5,AMAZING!!,"This was my first Gaelen Foley book and I could not put it down. I read it in two days! I can not wait to read Lord of Fire and Lord of Ice! Easy read and great love story. I laughed, I cried, what more do you want in a great romance!!"
1,Felt like punishment,"This is the first book I read by this author, and I'm never buying her books again. It starts off very s-l-o-w-l-y (and continues that way.) The hero is weak, unromantic, and, frankly, not the brightest guy. The heoine loves to suffer, oh so whoefully... This book had every possible cliche. The heroine has no money, so she becomes a whore, what else...The most annoying thing wasn't even the story. It was the writing style. Half the book felt like a mute slide show (please...) I like characters who talk and fight and make each other laugh. Alas, in this book you can expect no clever repartee between the lead characters, but lots of boring dialogues between lesser characters. The writer keeps telling us how intelligent the heroine is, and I kept asking, ""Really? Where? How? Show us!!!""No one answered."
3,Just another witless old cliche!,"It is too melodramatic for me. A helpless victim happens, lucky enough, to have a duck to save her. It's boring and it is just another witless old cliche ."
5,Original and wonderful!,"THE DUKE is terrific, and Ms. Foley only keeps getting better and better with each new book. I think this is her best yet, although I have a strong attachment to THE PIRATE PRINCE. Anyway, THE DUKE is the first in a series and features believable, interesting and smart characters. Oh, yeah, the hero is pretty darn sexy too! You will not be disappointed. Buy this book now before it's too late and you can't find it -- because it's a keeper and this author isn't afraid to take chances with style, story-telling or craft."
1,Avoid this non-interesting book.,"I love romances, so I keep track of what the reviewers say about rising new talents. Ms. Foley bored me to death. She tells the story, she doesn't show. The lead characters hardly spoke. Nor did they compensate for their lack of verbal communication with a physical one. They just... hang together. I don't understand the fixation some women have with turning into a one-man's prostitute. I would not want to be friends with the heroine because I could never respect her. Furthermore, Ms. Foley's prose plods on the pages. It took me a long time to finished this book and I did so only because I was on vacation abroad and had nothing else to read by the pool. Am never buying this author's books again."
3,poor old bel,"I really wanted to like this novel by Gaelen Foley, I've loved the Inferno series but I find that the knight miscellenay series is a little bit thin in the plot area. I've also found that the books start to sound too similar. In this book I take issue with the self absorbed Robert (the hero) and poor old Bel the heroine.I dont think that Robert was very respectful to Bel, I'd hoped that as the hero he would be able to see past the fascade of the courtesan but I found that throughout much of the book Robert behaved like a spoiled child and Bel behaved like a woman whose inner strength was destroyed after she was was physically attacked.Her decision to become a courtesan confused me, why didnt she just apply to be a governess or at the very least ladies maid? Those roles would have been more in keeping with her character I think.Not the best work by Gaelen and I really wasn't happy with the way the story about Robert's lost love was concluded."
5,Great beginning to a wonderful series.,Gaelen Foley adds wonderful historical touches to her stories. I believe this is the first time I've read about a character getting into a political arguement. It's small additions like these that make her historical novels and her characters come to life.
2,Blah blah boring,"This book was cliche and boring...i bought it because i read ""the pirate prince"" from this author and enjoyed it. But don't waste your time and money on this one. If your looking for a romance in this genre my favorite is ""the magic of you"" by Johanna Lindsey (or any of her Malory novels)."
3,Mostly very good...,"I really liked this book up until when they were in the country. Thats when Robert turned into a real jerk and I just couldn't get past that...I don't want to spoil it for other readers, so I won't say what killed it for me.Had it not been for that this would have been a keeper. For I loved everything else about it.Three stars because of how much I liked Belinda's integrity and self respect.Lizzie and Jacinda were adorable. Would love to see them again.Also the love scenes were perfect. Just the right blend of sensuality and romance."
2,"Great beginning, awful ending","I've read 4 books by Ms. Foley so far (Pirate Prince, Princess, Lord of Ice, and The Duke). The first three were great - especially Princess and Lord of Ice (5 stars for sure) but The Duke was pretty disappointing. The book started out good but by the time I got near the end of the book, I didn't want Robert and Belinda stay together. I wanted a happy ending for Belinda but wanted Robert to be miserable for the way he treated her. I realize that the times made it difficult for him - being the ever ""noble"" Duke and all but I just thought so little of him by the end that the ending left me feeling mad. Even his dueling (""risking his life"") was not really for Belinda - it was more tied into his ""idea"" of who he was - what he should do. I have all of Ms. Foley's other books and am still looking forward to reading them but I'm sorry that I read The Duke. The only reason I'm giving the book 2 stars is because it is a Galean Foley book and the first half of the book was good."
2,Didn't I read this story before....?,"If I didn't know this was by an author that I've never read before, I could swear I've read this book before. Thin plot? You bet. This one's been done over and over, from Cinderella on. The only saving grace is that the characters are well developed. Other than that, I skipped major pages and didn't miss a thing. Do yourself a favor. If you want to try this one, buy it used. It's been done."
4,great story,This was lent to me with well founded recommendations. I like the characters and the story was interesting. The only possible disappointment was the some-what hokey ending.
2,My first romance written by this author...not impressed.,"I don't think I'll pick up another one of this author's books. There is a great lack of chemistry between the characters and annoying traits in both of them. Plot was just ok. She could have made these characters, even the villians, pawns of more substance. Greatly lacking in character development, plot and romance. I skimmed a lot of her boring descriptions because they had nothing to do with the story and really added nothing but words and pages to the book. Don't waste your time. I'm astonished at the number of 5 sTar reviews. Try Judith McNaught (Whitney My Love and Until You) or Johanna Lindsey's, Man of My Dreams If you want good regency romance...not this fluff. Blech."
4,Awesome read,"This books starts with the First if the Knight siblings, Robert, who is bent of avenging the murder of his love. He has a suspect in mind and the only way he can be sure is to take his suspect's love interest has his own.Belinda, an inexperience courtsean knows she isn't virtuous enough for Robert and being his mistress is the best he can do. Well they both fall in love with each other in other to uncover the truth, but can love conquer all.The book started a little bit slow for me, but picked up right around chapter two, it was a page turner till the end, I couldn't put it down.The characters are very well developed, no idle jibberish dialogue between the characters. And the stupid factor was kept to a minimum.Only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is the political aspect of the book almost overshadowing the plot.Other than that I highly recommend this book."
4,Intriguing and disturbing,"The title of this book was what first grabbed me. You don't often see a book with the title Random Acts of Senseless Violence. Well, I'll tell you, it delivered.The book centers around Lola, a twelve-year-old whose family is forced to move to Harlem from midtown. Her transformation from preppy to streetcrawler is fascinating and intriguing the only reason this book doesn't get five stars is beacause it starts slow and the relationship between Iz and Lola doesn't get developed enoguh for my taste."
4,A tough one to handle,"I was assigned to read this book in a college writing course. Sometimes I couldn't put it down, other times, I wanted nothing better than to hide it from sight. It's a harsh, depressing novel that presents a deteriorating world in the near future through the eyes of a young girl. The reader experiences the coming of age of the main character, Lola, as she fights to maintain her own identity and struggles with homosexuality. The novel is both disturbing and intriguing, but what I found most difficult to accept was the fact that a male author could write in the perspective of a 12-year-old girl going through puberty. Overall it's a well-written book, but one should be prepared that it'll leave you shuddering at Jack Womack's pessimistic view of the years ahead."
